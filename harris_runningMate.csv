"(The Center Square) – Rumors swirled Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris may select Pennsylvania’s governor as her running mate. The news comes as Gov. Josh Shapiro himself encouraged Pennsylvania Democrats to unite behind her, just hours after President Joe Biden stepped down from his campaign."

(Photo by RYAN COLLERD / AFP) (Photo by RYAN COLLERD/AFP via G PHILADELPHIA - Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is believed to be among a handful of candidates being considered to join Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.  Shapiro, 51, has served as the state's governor for just over a year after he defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in the 2022 gubernatorial election. His career in Pennsylvania politics includes serving in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for eight years and the commonwealth's attorney general for six. Shapiro's next step in politics could take him to the White House, if he joins Kamala Harris's campaign to succeed Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. While Harris herself still needs to get the official nomination, Shapiro is rumored to highlight the shortlist of candidates to run as her vice president.  If Harris chooses Shapiro to be her running mate, Shapiro could continue to serve as Pennsylvania's governor. If the duo defeats Donald Trump and JD Vance in the November election, Shapiro will have to resign as governor. If that should happen, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis would be elevated to the position and become the state's first Black governor.  All but five states treat the lieutenant governor as first in line if the acting governor dies, resigns or is impeached.  Austin Davis is the youngest lieutenant governor in the country and the first Black lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania's history.  Prior to joining Shapiro's administration, Davis served for four years in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives from the state's 35th district. A native of McKeesport, Davis attended the University of Pittsburgh and earned a bachelors degree in political science. Davis, 34, married Blayre Holmes in 2017 and the couple welcomed their first child last year. A recent poll in Pennsylvania found that Shapiro could help Harris beat Trump and Vance, with 47 percent of voters saying they would vote for Harris if she ran alongside Shapiro. Meanwhile, Trump and Vance received 46 percent of the votes. Shapiro has yet to comment on any speculation, but the governor did highlight some similarities he shares with Harris. ""I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results,"" Shapiro said in his endorsement."
"A day after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro deflected questions about whether he would want to be Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate were she to become the Democrats’ presidential nominee. In an appearance Monday on Neville Island, Shapiro wouldn’t say whether he is interested in joining Harris on the Democratic ticket. Biden endorsed Harris shortly after announcing Sunday that he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination. Harris is quickly racking up endorsements from influential politicians across the country. On Monday, she secured unanimous support from Pennsylvania’s Democratic delegates. Shapiro, who endorsed Harris on Sunday, has been rumored as a vice presidential pick. During a news conference at Castle Builders Supply on Neville Island, Shapiro said Harris has a “deeply personal” decision about whom she would want with her on the ticket. “And a decision that should be free of any political influence,” Shapiro said. “She will make that decision when she is ready.” Shapiro was appearing with Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Mike Reagan and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato to celebrate securing nearly $400 million to cut pollution. The money will help industrial facilities like Castle Builders Supply run cleaner operations, and it will fund carbon capture technology to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Shapiro took several questions from the audience, and virtually all were focused on vice presidential rumors. Instead of tipping his hand, Shapiro heaped praise on the vice president. The swing-state governor said Harris is “absolutely ready” to be president and act as the standard-bearer for the Democratic Party. Shapiro said he spoke with Harris on Sunday shortly after talking to Biden. He said the conversation was focused on defeating former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “We talked about how we can’t go back to a time when Donald Trump ripped away our freedoms,” Shapiro said, noting that Trump tried to implement right-to-work legislation. “We will never be a right-to-work state as long as I am governor.” By not flatly rejecting being considered as a vice presidential candidate, Shapiro left the door more open than some others mentioned as being on the Democrats’ short list. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for instance, said Monday she is not interested in being a vice presidential nominee. And while he wouldn’t say if he wanted the opportunity, Shapiro acted a lot like a potential candidate during the rest of his brief trip to the Pittsburgh area. Shapiro visited the Eat‘n Park restaurant in Avalon after the news conference. There, he greeted diners and talked to workers at the popular Pittsburgh diner chain. He purchased some Smiley cookies and sang their praises. One young worker asked about gun control efforts, and he said he is fighting to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Shapiro spoke to Denise Mancini, 70, and Gary Thompson, 70, as they finished their afternoon meal. Mancini said she voted for Shapiro as governor and attorney general, and she was thrilled to meet him. “When politicians mingle with us regular people, it shows they care,” said Mancini, of Stowe. Mancini and Thompson said they would be excited to see Shapiro as Harris’ running mate. Shapiro praised Harris to anyone who asked, and he told reporters afterward that her background as a prosecutor would be invaluable during the race, considering Trump’s 34 criminal convictions for illegally influencing the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor. Harris, like Shapiro in Pennsylvania, served as attorney general in California. “The vice president has done an incredible job consolidating the Democratic Party across the country,” Shapiro said. “To be able to pick a prosecutor against a guy with 34 felonies, I like that matchup.” Ryan Deto is a TribLive reporter covering politics, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County news.

"President Joe Biden’s announcement Sunday that he won’t be seeking a second term has upended politics nationwide, and will almost certainly have a particularly acute impact on Pennsylvania. Many Democrats are expecting a new candidate to be accompanied by a renewed vigor to prevent another Donald Trump presidency — a push that is likely to filter down to other candidates on the ballot who, in several cases, had been out-performing the top of the ticket. Further, Biden bowing out means that Democrats could select Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — whose name ranks high in recent polling — as their nominee for either the presidency or more likely as a vice-presidential pick behind current VP Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to lead the ticket. Shapiro, in a statement issued Sunday evening, endorsed Harris — describing her as “a patriot worthy of our support” and someone who will “perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom.” State Sen. Sharif Street, D-Philadelphia - chair of the state Democratic Committee and head of Pennsylvania’s delegation to the Democratic National Convention - said at a Sunday press conference that “I fully anticipate” the state party to convene in the next few days to endorse Harris. While delegates will be able to support the candidate of their choosing at the convention, Street said he plans to encourage everyone to unite around Harris. In speaking with his counterparts elsewhere, the “overwhelming majority of state chairs say they intend to support Kamala Harris, and they anticipate that Kamala Harris will be our nominee and the next President of United States,” Street said. Few Democrats, however, wanted to engage in broad speculation about Shapiro’s role, stressing the need to consolidate the party around the idea of a new direction, while also emphasizing the concrete accomplishments that Biden – and Harris – have already achieved. “I don’t know if today’s the day to begin discussions about that,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford, D-Montgomery County, said of Shapiro being on the ticket.

Shapiro has an amazing record that’s worthy of consideration,” Bradford continued, “but again, today is about President Biden and his decades of service to our country.” Bradford is one of many state Democratic leaders who will serve as a delegate to the party convention next month in Chicago; Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny County, also fills the same role. “As a committed Biden delegate, I’ve got to give a lot of consideration to the president’s preference for Vice President Harris,” Costa said Sunday. “I also think Josh Shapiro could be an outstanding leader in this country and as we go through this process over the course of the next several weeks, we’ll see how that plays out and how it culminates at the convention,” Costa continued. “But it’s too early to tell who all is going to be in the mix for the president or the vice president at this point.” Street likewise said he would be supportive of Shapiro as a VP pick, but that Harris needed space to make the decision herself. “I’m always for the hometown kid, but I really do believe we have to let Kamala Harris, when she’s our presidential nominee, make that selection,” Street said. Biden announced his departure from the race in an open letter to the American people on Sunday, highlighting a number of his accomplishments — such as climate change legislation, lowering prescription drug costs, and record job creation — but concluding that “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” The move capped weeks of heated discussions among Democrats as to Biden’s ability to carry through the campaign after a lackluster debate performance and concerns about his age and stamina. National media on Sunday reported general enthusiasm from political allies that Harris, Shapiro, or any other possible picks would be able to run on the best aspects of Biden’s record without his personal limitations. “There’s no president in a generation who has been as steadfast in his commitment to amplifying the American labor movement,” Angela Ferritto, president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, wrote Sunday, adding that Biden “shifted the paradigm toward working people” and that Harris “has been standing shoulder to shoulder” with him in that effort. Costa similarly credited Biden’s economy — with its low unemployment and high infrastructure investment — for Pennsylvania’s significant budget surplus, which has also been a highlight of Shapiro’s governorship. “If there was to be a Harris-Shapiro ticket and I think the message that they have would resonate in the important states like Wisconsin and Illinois and Michigan,” Costa said. “There’s similarities in the nature of those states and that will bring a lot of support to a national ticket.” First lady Jill Biden, left, and second gentleman Douglass Emhoff, right, watch as President Joe Biden, center left, raises the hand of Vice President Kamala Harris as they view the Independence Day firework display over the National Mall from the balcony of the White House, July 4, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)AP Eugene DePasquale – the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Attorney General – told PennLive on Sunday that Biden bowing out creates “a whole new ball game” for political campaigns in the Commonwealth. “I think it’s a decision he made to put the country before his own self-interest, and that is a very rare thing for people to do,” DePasquale said of Biden’s decision to drop out and endorse Harris. “Certainly as I was campaigning across the state, [Biden] was bleeding independents and the moderate Republicans” who had supported him in 2020, DePasquale said. But with Biden stepping aside, “now I think we’ve got a whole new ball game,” DePasquale continued, and “there will be a renewed energy into the campaign as a result of this decision.” DePasquale is known for his cross-partisan support, easily winning two terms as Pennsylvania Auditor General in the 2012 and 2016 elections, and coming close to unseating Rep. Scott Perry – a close Trump ally – in 2020. DePasquale, along with other popular statewide Democrats like Sen. Bob Casey, have been running significantly ahead of Biden in recent polls – not dissimilar from 2016, where DePasquale easily won re-election despite Hillary Clinton losing Pennsylvania. “It can be done, but it makes it more challenging,” DePasquale said of running with a less-popular candidate at the top of the ticket. “I have enormous respect for the President,” DePasquale said, but the polling gap “means there’s clearly an issue with the debate, clearly an issue with his age, those were certainly factors.” Assuming Harris is the nominee at the Democratic National Convention next month, “she has the ability to prosecute the case against the former President that the current President was not capable of doing,” DePasquale said. “She’ll have the ability to be in four states in one day.” Street also predicted that Harris — who if elected would be the first woman and first woman of color to become U.S. President — would energize Pennsylvania’s black voters. Running a candidate two decades younger than Trump would also help motivate the commonwealth’s younger voters, Street said. “She’s no stranger to us, she’s spent a lot of time here and I think people will be ready to enthusiastically support her,” Street said."

"With President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential campaign, many are wondering what it means for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor has already attracted national attention, with many political pundits predicting he would make a run for national office after finishing his term in Harrisburg. When the political winds shifted after Biden’s weak debate performance, Shapiro’s name, along with Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, were mentioned as potential options should the current president bow out. Since Biden's announcement on Sunday, the president and Shapiro have each endorsed Harris for president. But that leaves another question, could Harris pick Shapiro as her VP? While there are still many questions, many insiders view Shapiro as a strong pick, especially given that he has been a popular governor in a vital swing state. Update: The Associated Press is reporting that aides to Shapiro confirmed that Harris spoke to the governor Sunday afternoon. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was born June 20, 1973, and raised in Montgomery County. He majored in political science at the University of Rochester and earned his Juris Doctor degree from Georgetown University. Shapiro, a Democrat, was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 2004 and represented the 153rd District until 2012. He served on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2011 to 2017 and held the position of chairman. Shapiro successfully ran for Pennsylvania attorney general in 2016 and was reelected in 2020. As attorney general, he released the results of a grand jury report that alleged the sexual abuse of children by priests and helped negotiate $1 billion for Pennsylvania as part of a national opioid settlement. He also forced an agreement between two of the state's largest insurance companies, protecting health care access for two million people. He has repeatedly gone to court to defend reproductive rights and a woman's right to choose. In 2021, he announced he was running for governor of Pennsylvania in the 2022 election. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Doug Mastriano in the general election. Shapiro was sworn in as Pennsylvania's 48th governor on Jan. 17, 2023. Shapiro and his wife, Lori, have four children.

"Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, potentially Kamala Harris' running mate, has made his Jewish identity central to his career, is popular in a key swing state and has championed reproductive rights. 'Israel not only has a right to defend itself, it has a responsibility to combat Hamas,' he said recently WASHINGTON – Shortly after U.S. President Joe Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, speculation on her potential running mate quickly became a dominating narrative."
"Although Gov. Shapiro won’t answer whether he would take the VP role if offered, that hasn't stopped Pa. Democrats from pushing for Harris to choose him. Gov. Josh Shapiro delivers his budget address for the 2024-25 fiscal year to a joint session of the Pennsylvania House and Senate in the Rotunda of the state Capitol in Harrisburg, Pa., Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) What questions do you have about the 2024 elections? What major issues do you want candidates to address? Let us know. With President Biden stepping out of the race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, the nation is now speculating over potential VP picks. One name on the shortlist: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. “It’s a no-brainer,” Bob Brady, Chair of the Philadelphia Democratic Party, told WHYY News. “Everyone says that the road to victory goes through Pennsylvania, so why not go with the person who can ensure that victory?” Pa. Democrats spent much of Monday morning in deep discussion around the weekend’s events, seeking consensus on Vice President Kamala Harris as Pennsylvania’s nominee for president. However, multiple sources — including Brady — said that the subject of Shapiro was also a hot topic of conversation. “There was no endorsement made, but everyone on the call was in agreement that it would help the ticket tremendously in Pennsylvania,” said Brady, who attended the meetings held by the state party committee, county party chairs, and Pa. delegates to next month’s Democratic National Convention (DNC). Brady said he plans to bring up the issue directly with Harris. Philly-area officials react to Biden dropping out of presidential race Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro is speculated as a possible vice presidential candidate to Kamala Harris. Daniel P. Bauder, president of the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO and a DNC delegate, confirmed that the delegates are broadly in agreement about the governor. “It makes a lot of sense,” he said. “Just looking at it very objectively, you’ve got a very popular governor in a swing state who’s got tremendous favorability across the board politically, who’s got a lot of labor support. He is a tremendous campaigner, somebody who’s tireless in the way that he pursues an objective, both like an electoral goal, but even a policy one. And so objectively, I think the Governor Shapiro has to be the top of everyone’s list.” Shapiro is not responding to questions about whether he would accept the offer if it was presented. He confirmed that he spoke with Vice President Harris Sunday, but the conversation centered on “how we beat Donald Trump and protect our freedoms here in this commonwealth.” “I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals,” he told reporters at a press conference in Pittsburgh Monday. “This is a deeply personal decision that the vice president will make. She will make it on her own timetable and her own timeline. She needs to choose someone that she’s prepared to govern with, campaign with, and someone that she feels most comfortable with and that decision should be made free of any sort of political pressure.” But that hasn’t stopped Pennsylvania Democrats from making their case. What happens next: Joe Biden wants to pass the baton to Kamala Harris. Here’s how that might work Democrats, who are set to hold their convention in Chicago in August, now must navigate a shift that is unprecedented this late in an election year. Shapiro has been the governor for less than two years, but in that short time, he has been tested by a series of crises that garnered him national attention. Just a month after taking office last January 2023, a train derailment in bordering East Palestine, Ohio, forced the evacuation of thousands of Pennsylvanians. Last June, a heavily trafficked segment of I-95 in Philadelphia collapsed but was repaired in less than two weeks. Most recently, he was lauded for his response to the shooting in Butler. Shapiro also has a reputation as a skilled and pragmatic legislator willing to compromise when necessary. He is one of the most popular politicians among Pennsylvania voters, with a favorability rating of up to 60%. “He’s one of the most liked governors of all time, and his policies are pretty down the middle,” State Rep. Danilo Burgos of North Philly told WHYY News. “And that’s what Americans are calling for, is to make America the leader that it once was.” While Republicans say they believe Donald Trump will beat Harris regardless of who she picks as VP, many still express respect for the governor. “Josh is a very talented, smart politician and a longtime friend,” RNC delegate Jeff Bartos of Montgomery County told WHYY News. “But no matter who they put on the ticket, the Democrats are going to have the Biden-Harris agendas. They’re going to have to answer for that, whether it’s inflation, whether it’s the border crisis, whether it’s crime, whether it’s war on energy … There’s just no way for the Democrats to win Pennsylvania.” ‘Exciting’: Pa. delegates, GOP pols react to former Trump critic as VP pick Pennsylvania Republicans are reacting positively to Trump’s choice of J.D. Vance — a veteran, venture capitalist and one-time Trump critic — as his pick for vice president. Philly’s suburbs are crucial to the presidential race. After the first debate, some voters are wincing at the Biden-Trump rematch Voters in Bucks and Montgomery counties could prove pivotal in deciding the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. What Pa. voters can expect from Biden and Trump’s historic presidential debate A national poll found Trump has a slight lead over Biden. The same goes for polling focused on Pennsylvania, where the lead is often within the margin of error."
"LUZERNE COUNTY, Pa. — Governor Josh Shapiro made a stop in Luzerne County on Friday to talk about the state budget, but all eyes are on the governor for a different reason. The Democrat is at the top of the polls as a potential presidential candidate should President Joe Biden bow out of the race for the White House.  ""The president has made his decision, and I support President Biden,"" said Governor Josh Shapiro.  Governor Shapiro delivered a clear and concise message from the stage in Duryea Friday afternoon. The Governor did not waver in his support of President Biden's stay in the race for the Oval Office despite a growing number of calls from high-ranking Democrats across the country for the President to bow out of the election.  ""I think it's super unhelpful to engage in any hypotheticals,"" added the Governor. The Governor elaborated on a new Politico poll placing him as a potential Democratic candidate should President Biden step out of the race. Shapiro was one of four candidates who performed the strongest in the poll, outpacing President Biden by roughly 5 points across battleground states, including here in Pennsylvania.  ""There's a clear contrast in this race and I think the focus needs to not be on hypotheticals. The focus needs to be on the particular race we have before us and the clear differences between the two candidates,"" added the Governor. President Joe Biden said in a statement Friday that he was planning to return to the campaign trail next week and insisted he has a path to victory over Trump, despite the worries of some of his party's most eminent members. Despite a divisive election cycle, Governor Shapiro had a message of unity. As the firefighter killed during last weekend's assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump was laid to rest in Western Pennsylvania Friday. The man Shapiro calls a hero. ""My message today is, let's remember Corey. Let's pray for those who were injured. Let's use this as an example of lifting up our politics and not allowing it to ever be violent and speaking out against that no matter what our views are, or party registrations are, or who our preferred candidate is,"" added Governor Shapiro."
"Pennsylvania's 159 Democratic delegates pledged their support to Vice President Kamala Harris during a conference call Monday, a day after President Joe Biden exited the presidential race over concerns about his age and ability to lead the country for another four years, according to a delegate who took part in the call. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party chairman, state Sen. Sharif Street, convened the 1 p.m. meeting as delegations from other states quickly coalesced around Harris. Harris is trying to lock up the nomination ahead of the party's convention Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. She became the likely favorite to fill President Joe Biden's shoes after Biden announced he would end his presidential bid and back Harris. Erie County delegate Chelcie Alcorn said Sunday that it was unfortunate Biden exited the race but ""thankfully"" it appeared Harris would be the party's choice. ""I don't want a brokered convention,"" Alcorn said Sunday. ""I don't want to spend the next month having an internal fight that should have been done in the primary election. Kamala was on the ticket that was voted on with Joe Biden in the primary election. That's my biggest concern, that the voters have a voice."" Alcorn said it was ""a little late in the game to change our horse out,"" which is why she maintained her support of Biden, ""but I think that we have a solid candidate in Kamala, especially with his (Biden's) blessing."""
"HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has emerged as a top contender for the vice-presidential nod following President Joe Biden’s stunning announcement that he is dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing Kamala Harris to take his spot on the ballot. Shapiro, 51, was elected Pennsylvania’s governor in 2022 and assumed office in January 2023. He is a moderate Democrat whose career trajectory has seen him move from congressional aide to Pennsylvania’s chief executive, all within two decades. Already, top elected Democrats in Pennsylvania like state House Speaker Joanna McClinton and party leaders like Philadelphia Democratic chair Bob Brady have endorsed Shapiro as a possible vice presidential pick, citing his wins in a divided General Assembly and electoral success in a key swing state. At a Monday afternoon event in Pittsburgh, Shapiro said he has spoken to both Biden and Harris, but declined to say whether he is in talks to join the ticket. “We spoke only about defeating Donald Trump and our shared commitment to that. I immediately gave her my endorsement and said I would do everything in my power to support her here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said of his Sunday conversation with Harris. He added, “This is a deeply personal decision that the vice president will make. She will make it on her own timetable and her own timeline. She needs to choose someone that she's prepared to govern with, campaign with, and someone that she feels most comfortable with, and that decision should be made free of any sort of political pressure.” Unlike other rumored picks, like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Shapiro did not rule out the idea of running for vice president during the Monday event. If Shapiro were to be tapped as a vice presidential candidate, he would be able to campaign while simultaneously serving as governor. The son of a pediatrician and educator who grew up in Philadelphia’s suburbs, Shapiro initially planned to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. But a few months into his freshman year at Rochester University, he nearly flunked his organic chemistry class. Around the same time, his dream of playing college basketball was shattered when he was cut from the university’s basketball team. A knock on his dorm room door not long after would end up launching his career in public service, and later, politics: It was a fellow student, asking him if he would run for student government. He did — and won. He hasn’t lost a bid for public office since. In his 20s, he worked as a congressional aide on Capitol Hill while also getting his law degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. In 2004, he ran for a seat representing Montgomery County in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives. He won, and remained in the state House for four two-year terms, during which he came to be known as a policy wonk and, later, a strategist who helped Democrats cement a razor-thin voting advantage in the chamber. His first statewide run for office came in 2016 when he launched his successful campaign to helm the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, which had just come off four tumultuous and scandal-plagued years under Democratic predecessor Kathleen Kane. He ran for governor in 2022 against a Trump-endorsed candidate, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin). Shapiro cast the race as a referendum on preserving democracy and constitutionally protected freedoms, including the right to abortion. Again, Shapiro handily won the election and, in the process, shattered records for the most money ever spent on a governor’s race in Pennsylvania. Shapiro, an observant Conservative Jew, has frequently said that his faith played prominently into his decision to enter public service. Many of Shapiro’s key achievements came while he was Pennsylvania’s attorney general. But his legacy there was irrevocably shaped by his office’s scathing grand jury report on child sexual abuse and its coverup in nearly every Roman Catholic diocese in Pennsylvania. The investigation — which Kane, his predecessor, had initiated — sparked similar inquiries across the nation and landed Shapiro on television screens across the globe. As attorney general, Shapiro positioned himself as a foil to the values and policies of Trump and his administration. He joined other Democratic attorneys general in suing the administration over its family-separation policy for migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border; and over a rule that would have allowed employers more leeway in denying birth control coverage mandates under the Affordable Care Act. Shapiro’s office was also the one in court defending Pennsylvania’s election results, which came under attack by Trump and his surrogates in the weeks after Trump’s loss to Biden in the 2020 election. Less than two weeks after Shapiro took office as governor, he had to contend with a crisis when a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, less than a mile from Pennsylvania’s border, and released thousands of tons of toxic chemicals. Then, amid state budget talks, an overpass on I-95 suddenly collapsed after a truck fire. The bridge was used by tens of thousands of Philadelphia commuters every day, and its failure required Shapiro to coordinate a temporary replacement in less than two weeks while under national scrutiny. The speed with which the highway was rebuilt, and Shapiro’s visibility during the project — hovering over the collapse in a helicopter, setting up a construction live stream, holding enthusiastic media briefings — won him national attention. As governor, Shapiro has negotiated two budgets with Pennsylvania’s divided state legislature — the only in the country — that dramatically increased funding for public education. Budget negotiations during his first year in office were temporarily delayed after a politically embarrassing incident. As the June 30 deadline neared, the governor, according to multiple accounts, privately negotiated a deal with state Senate Republicans to create a taxpayer-funded school voucher plan. Democrats privately said they were blindsided by the move and refused to give their support to the proposal. Despite Shapiro’s efforts to assuage members of his party, the governor was forced to abandon the plan. Shapiro scored a major win in this year’s budget, securing $500 million for a program to prepare sites for industrial or mixed-use developments. Still, the final deal did not include several other key issues Shapiro advocated for, including sustainable funding for public transit and the legalization of adult-use recreational marijuana. “There were some things we didn't get done this time,” Shapiro acknowledged during a news conference after signing the budget, “but in a productive democracy, this is how progress is made — by moving past partisan politics and having real conversations together.” One of the few controversies of Shapiro’s tenure as governor came courtesy of one of his oldest allies, his now-former legislative liaison Mike Vereb. Shapiro and Vereb, a Republican, are both from Montgomery County and served together in the state House. When Shapiro became attorney general, he brought Vereb on as a top advisor. And when Shapiro was elected governor, Vereb was one of the few Republicans to join his staff, this time in a key role as the governor’s emissary to the legislature. But in September, Vereb resigned. His departure came shortly after reporters had learned a staffer had filed a complaint against him alleging harassment that had begun shortly after the start of the administration. Spotlight PA learned that the administration had quietly paid out $295,000 to settle the complaint three weeks before Vereb’s abrupt resignation. Shapiro would not discuss the matter in any detail, with his administration saying only that it handled the matter in a professional and timely manner. That settlement isn’t the only matter about which Shapiro has been notably tight-lipped. Across the board, Shapiro’s administration has been markedly more opaque than previous governors’. As Shapiro prepared to take office, he had members of his transition team sign nondisclosure agreements and would not say who paid for inauguration events. Unlike his predecessor, who released detailed daily schedules, Shapiro has declined to regularly release information about who he meets with behind the scenes. He also categorizes his daily calendars as “personal” papers, which exempts them from the state’s Right-To-Know Law. The governor also loosened a notoriously tight gift ban for his employees while arguing it would still protect against gifts from lobbyists influencing his agenda. However, Shapiro has still accepted free tickets, including to the Super Bowl, paid for by unknown donors to a little-known fund managed by Team PA, a Harrisburg-based nonprofit of which the governor is a co-chair. He also listed tickets to sporting events, from long-time donors and lobbyists, as campaign contributions. The administration has argued this is all in compliance with the state’s ethics and campaign finance laws, which are among the most lax in the country, and that the gift ban doesn’t apply to Team PA. Shapiro, one of the country’s most prominent Jewish politicians, has also taken a central role in condemning antisemitism and what he sees as weak responses to it in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. “I am pro-the idea of a Jewish homeland, a Jewish state, and I will certainly do everything in my power to ensure that Israel is strong and Israel is fortified and will exist for generations,” Shapiro told the New York Times. As protests against Israel’s war in Gaza — where the death toll now tops 39,000 — have escalated, Shapiro has argued some demonstrations have crossed a line into bigotry. Amid rising protests against the war, the Shapiro administration updated the office’s code of conduct to bar “scandalous” conduct. An email accompanying the policy cited social media posts, boycotts, graffiti, and public confrontations as examples of potential “hate speech” that would not be tolerated. He also backed a bipartisan bill that would strip state funding from any school that divests from Israel. Before Biden announced he was stepping down, Shapiro, who has made many appearances as a surrogate for and supporter of Biden, said he stood by the president. Soon after Biden announced he would not accept the nomination for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, Shapiro issued a statement giving her his full support. “I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results,” Shapiro said in a statement released by his campaign office. “Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom. She has served the country honorably as Vice President and she is ready to be President.” BEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

"Voters in Pennsylvania, a swing state, reacted to President Biden's endorsement of Kamala Harris for president."
"Emerson College/7News pollster Spencer Kimball that Vice President Kamala Harris could grab a significant portion of the female vote if she becomes the Democratic nominee for president, after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race Sunday. Kimball also named Democratic governors across the United States who could throw their hats in the ring and run for president, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. “One of the strongest candidates has been Gov. Josh Shapiro down in Pennsylvania. We’ve noticed he does particularly well with younger voters and captured similar results to what we saw Senator Bernie Sanders receive,” Kimball said in an interview with 7News. Kimball also brought up California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “And who’s to say that Bernie Sanders doesn’t see this as an opportunity to put his hat in the ring and perhaps win the nomination at the convention?” Kimball said. As for Harris, Kimball said that women across the United States could be excited to elect the first female president. “As if the race hasn’t been exciting enough over the last couple of weeks, now we throw this into it, we will see if she’s able to get really female voters,” Kimball said. “I know that the Black, African American vote was a little softer for President Biden the last time around, but it was really the female vote overall that he was losing support for. He won that vote by about 15 points and it’s down to five.” “This would give female voters the opportunity to elect the first female President of the United States, and that could create some national excitement for the candidacy and propel her to jump up in the polls, particularly in the states of Georgia and obviously in the Midwest that she will have to hold onto,” Kimball continued. However, even though Harris was endorsed by Biden, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and other past and present political leaders, Kimball said the candidacy is still up in the air. “It’ll be interesting to see if anyone else jumps into the race, and then remember, there still has to be a vice presidential process, which is also nominated on by the delegates at the convention,” Kimball said. This is a developing story; Stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates on Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race."
"Critics slammed CNN after anchor John King said there were “risks” in putting forward Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as the Democratic vice presidential nominee because “he’s Jewish.” “He’s certainly under consideration,” King said on CNN Sunday night, referencing discussions with allies of Vice President Kamala Harris. “He’s a first-term governor, he’s Jewish, there could be some risks in putting him on the ticket, but certainly some of our voters here in Pennsylvania said, ‘Hey, we like Gov. Shapiro, give him a look,'” he added. King, who announced plans to convert to Judaism back in 2008, was briefly married to CNN anchor Dana Bash, who is Jewish. While it is not entirely clear what prompted King’s remarks, Democrats have been mired by infighting over the Israel-Hamas war.  The popular X account StopAntisemitism underscored the hateful comment by pointing out how different the response would be if another ethnic minority were singled out: “Replace ‘Jewish’ with ‘Muslim’ or ‘Black…'” “CNN POV: Being almost any minority group in politics is historic and a milestone. Being Jewish in politics is ‘risky and controversial,'” wrote Jaboc Helberg, a senior adviser at Palantir.  “It says a lot about the state of American politics, and perhaps especially in progressive circles, that one of the ‘cons’ of #KamalaHarris selecting Gov. Josh Shapiro as her VP, is that he is Jewish and the pushback this might receive,” added International Legal Forum CEO Arsen Ostrovsky. Shapiro joins a growing list of potential running mates on the 2024 Democratic ticket after President Biden’s stunning decision Sunday afternoon to withdraw from the race. “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” the 81-year-old commander-in-chief wrote in a letter addressed to the nation on Sunday. Biden endorsed Harris minutes later, though he was not joined in that decision by senior Democrats in Congress or former President Barack Obama. But if Harris secures the presidential nomination, other vice presidential nominees who have been floated include Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker."
"Soon after President Joe Biden announced Sunday he’s withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race, Pennsylvania elected officials responded to the news, with Democrats praising his years of public service. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who has been mentioned as a possible running mate if Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, called Biden a “patriot” and “one of the most consequential presidents in modern history” in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom,” Shapiro wrote. “I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania — the Commonwealth that raised him.” Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., echoed the gratitude for Biden’s “exemplary career in public service.” “President Biden has always dedicated himself to improving the lives of Americans,” Casey wrote on X. “He deserves our gratitude for his historic achievements, including rebuilding our economy after the pandemic and delivering the largest infrastructure investment in modern history.” Biden’s decision — announced in a Sunday statement — follows weeks of speculation and calls from within his own party to exit from the race. A late June debate with former President Donald Trump raised questions about the president’s age, health and electability. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in the statement. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” President Joe Biden withdrew Sunday from the 2024 presidential race.

Gavin Newsom responds to Joe Biden dropping out. Here’s what he said → Why some say Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear would make a great VP candidate → With Biden out, what could be next for NC Gov. Roy Cooper? State Rep. Paul Takac, D-College Township, said in a statement that Biden’s decision “demonstrates his tremendous personal strength and selfless leadership.” “President Biden’s influence and impact will be felt for generations to come. Over the past four years, he not only helped restore America’s standing in the world but led us back from a badly mismanaged pandemic and historic threats to our democracy. And in a highly partisan and divided Congress, he successfully championed both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which make transformational investments that will ensure a brighter future for us all. In a second statement issued Sunday, Biden endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee for president in 2024. On X, State College Mayor Ezra Nanes, who is a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, shared a photo of himself with Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and wrote that he joins Biden in endorsing Harris as the party’s nominee. Casey and Shapiro also put their support behind Harris. While some Republicans were swift Sunday to criticize Harris as the potential nominee, U.S. Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Howard, did not address her in a written statement. “I was surprised to learn that President Biden has ended his campaign, pushed out under the pressure of Democratic Party elites, alongside vulnerable House Members and Senators, who saw risk to their own political futures by being tied to an executive who is clearly not up to the task,” Thompson said."
"Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports the latest on who could step in as vice president for Kamala Harris' presidential bid from Butler, Pennsylvania. RNC spokesperson Elizabeth Pipko and Dr. Sheila Nazarian joined 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss."
"In the latest sign that the Democratic Party is coalescing behind Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign for president, the Pennsylvania delegation to the Democratic National Convention unanimously voted to endorse her candidacy during an emergency meeting on Monday.  “There is a tremendous amount of excitement in seeing Vice President Kamala Harris become the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street said. “More than $66.9 million was raised through ActBlue yesterday, breaking the single-day record for dollars raised. Vice President Harris will be able to take the historic success of the Biden-Harris Administration and carry it forward under her leadership, vision, and intellect.” The Pennsylvania Democratic Party’s Executive Board also officially announced its endorsement of Harris for president. The vote came roughly 24 hours after President Joe Biden announced he wasn’t seeking reelection and pledged his support for Harris.  Street also thanked Biden in the press release, saying the president has “a history of putting America first over a career spanning more than half a century,” and lauded his record on the economy.  Other delegates from battleground states, including North Carolina, have also pledged support for Harris since Sunday’s announcement. Since Biden’s announcement Sunday, Pennsylvania Republicans have largely criticized his decision and his endorsement of Harris, with some suggesting the president should resign. But a bevy of Pennsylvania elected officials, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and the state’s entire Democratic congressional caucus have endorsed Harris. Pennsylvania Democrats line up behind Kamala Harris, with some endorsing Josh Shapiro as VP State Rep. Danilo Burgos (D-Philadelphia), a Democratic delegate, told the Capital-Star it was clear even before Monday’s vote that Pennsylvania was “all-in for Harris.” He said building a national consensus within the party is essential to Harris’ success as the presidential nominee. “We still have four weeks to go, but I hope no one announces against her. She’s proven and she can do the work. It’s time we all focus on stopping Trump and his 2025 agenda,” Burgos said. State Rep. Melissa Cerrato (D-Montgomery), another delegate, said the vote to endorse Harris brought “great sense of unity for the party.” “It was very, very exciting when they called for a motion,” Cerrato told the Capital-Star. “At least 40 or 50 people all tried to make the motion all at the same time.” “As a Black woman, this is personal for me to be able to cast my vote for a qualified, capable, smart, and very deserving Black woman to lead this country,” Dauphin County Democratic Party Chairwoman Rogette Harris, a delegate, said in a statement. “It’s a known fact that Black women are the heartbeat of the Democratic Party as the largest, most loyal voting block.”  “I encourage the Democratic Party to support qualified Black female leadership at the same capacity and vigor that Black women support the Democratic Party,” she added. Ninety-two percent of Black voters in Pennsylvania supported Biden in 2020 over Donald Trump, according to exit polling.  Polling this cycle showed Biden leading Trump with Black voters, but the margins were becoming more narrow. There has not been a poll released since yesterday’s announcement showing how a Harris vs Trump matchup would poll in Pennsylvania.  Prior to Biden’s exit from the race, amid calls from dozens of members of his own party to not seek reelection, Pennsylvania Democrats remained loyal behind his bid for a second term.  On Thursday, a few hours ahead of Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Democratic county commissioners from Philadelphia’s collar counties, who serve as delegates to the DNC, said they would be supporting Biden at the convention.  “President Biden is our presumptive nominee and I know that there have been a lot of calls for him to step aside, but we have a responsibility as leaders in our party to standby President Biden and that’s an inherently personal choice that he has to make,” Montgomery County Commissioner Jamila Winder said on Thursday, prior to Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race. “My point of view here is that we need to support our presumptive nominee and that’s President Biden.” “I think that we all love and respect Joe Biden and wanted him to be president again, but part of him stepping aside is him asking us to have faith in the vice president,” Bucks County Commissioner Chairperson Diane Ellis-Marseglia told the Capital-Star on Monday. “She’s the most prepared. She’s been the vice president for four years.” Burgos shared a similar sentiment.  “I hate to see him step down but like he said, it’s in our interest as a nation that he decides to step away and support Vice President Harris for president,” Burgos said.  Should Harris earn the nod for the Democratic Party’s nomination for president, she would have to select a running mate.  Ellis-Marseglia said the process by which a vice president nominee will be chosen is less clear. “I assume [Harris] must be vetting people right now. Who knows whether something would leak out. It may even be something that they try to put off until the convention to add some excitement,” she told the Capital-Star.  Shapiro has been mentioned as a potential candidate for that role and plenty of Pennsylvania Democrats are saying he should join the ticket.  “I think he’s fabulous and we need to carry Pennsylvania and it would be a smart move,” Ellis-Marseglia said.  Burgos said choosing the right vice presidential nominee is crucial to secure the votes of moderate Republicans, “who understand that you have to govern and not throw tantrums.” “Someone like Governor Shapiro can galvanize people to a common cause like he’s doing here in Pennsylvania and I believe that he can do it for our great nation as well,” Burgos said. Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton and Philadelphia Democratic Party Chairman Bob Brady have also voiced their support for Shapiro to join Harris on the ticket as the candidate for vice president.  Shapiro was asked about joining the ticket during a press conference in Pittsburgh on Monday. He said he didn’t want to engage in hypothetical conversations about whether he would be interested in being Harris’ running mate but did speak with Harris on Sunday. “The conversations I’ve had with the Vice President are all about one thing and one thing only: How do we defeat Donald Trump?” Shapiro said. "
"Coming off the heels of President Biden’s historic announcement that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsing his running mate, The Durango Herald asked La Plata County residents, “How do you feel about President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris potentially becoming the Democratic nominee.” Residents had mixed opinions about whether the announcement would help or hurt the Democrat's chances of winning come November. They also questioned the enduring usefulness of the two-party system and how the decision will affect Biden’s legacy in the history books. “I think they’re both awful. I think Trump’s awful, I think the state of American politics is just beyond salvageable. Harris running is going to make sure Trump’s a winner. Harris is very inexperienced, she doesn’t have any foreign policy credentials. I just don’t think she’s up to the task. There were a lot of people who were on the fence that are going to now vote for Trump because Harris isn’t qualified. And just so you know, I’m a Nikki Haley fan.” “I think it’s what was required for us to move forward and have Donald Trump not be president. Biden was just getting too old and we need some younger people in there. Trump’s too old himself. I’m not sure if she’s strongest but I don’t know what else they could do at this point in time.” “I feel positive. I would have voted for Biden, but I definitely feel he’s declined in the past year. A lot of people say, ‘How come you now like Harris? You never see her?’ Well, if you don’t follow her you’re not on that algorithm, but she’s everywhere. She’s out talking to people, meeting people. She’s met world leaders. I feel really strongly that she does have a presence even if the ‘right’ obviously doesn’t follow her. I heard this morning that she already raised $50 million after Biden endorsed her, and we were behind after Trump’s assassination attempt, so that’s positive. But I think her VP pick will be crucial, and because there’s still misogyny in this country, I do feel like she should pick a man.” “Well, I’m kind of sorry because Harris probably has a chance now against Trump and I was hoping that Biden would stay in and then lose. I’ve lived in this country for 40 years, I went through the Reagan era, great prosperity, etc., then I went through Clinton and Obama and I see this country increasingly have problems, inflation, internationally, etc. Then when Trump came in, this country was doing great.” “It’s kind of just like another day for me. It’s just Monday. There are a lot of challenges the Democrats still have to face, like not going through the nomination process democratically and having a cherry-picked candidate. But I think anyone who voted for Biden in 2020 probably thought that Kamala might get the presidency because Biden was old as (crap). I’m more of a leftist of the political spectrum so I think the current American two-party system doesn’t favor the American people.” “I think it was time for Biden to step down, so I think he’s doing the right thing but I’m a little bit weary. I like Kamala Harris but I don't know if she's done anything that shows us she's presidential yet. We certainly haven't heard much about what she's done as vice president. I'm also not happy with what's going on with the border. I’m still waiting to see if they put up some other candidates to compete with her. I do like her, but I'm not sure if she's the one that's going to take us where we need to be as a country. I’m unaffiliated, so I don’t vote straight Democrat, but I definitely can’t vote for Trump based on what I’ve seen so far, and Project 2025 is terrifying.” “We kind of saw it coming with all his stumbling around; seems like he’s close to senile anyway. I don’t think having Kamala Harris run could hurt (the Democrats) chances but it seems like they’re both different sides of the same coin. All the Democrats love women so I’m sure they’re going to eat that up, but I don’t know if everybody’s ready yet. I also don’t necessarily think it has to be a man or a woman, it should be whether they’re the right person for our country. It would be nice to have a woman but whether that should be Harris is hard to say considering how hard she was on crime in the beginning of her career and how hard she was on people.” “I’ve never met either personally, so I can only really conjecture based off what I’m shown by the media. But you can just see how they’re watering things down more and more, like look at Disney, with all the diverse characters now and everything like that at the cost of actual storytelling. It’s also taking place in politics, and Kamala Harris is the best example of that. It doesn’t need to be said but obviously this isn’t working, the two-party system is insane. It’s completely useless. Well, it’s not useless unless you want to create division and establish a culture of division like we have now.” “I feel like it’s kind of scary that it’s this close to the election. Maybe it will be hard for people to rally around her in the four short months that are left. I feel like Biden has honestly done a good job and she’s (Harris) been there alongside him but it’s just shaking things up too much with so little time left. ” “I think it was the right thing to do. As far as Harris coming in as the new nominee, well, nobody knows anything about her. She’s been in for four years and I’ve only heard her name a few times. One thing I do know about her is that she was in charge of the border wall and she did nothing, she didn’t even go down there. (Fact check: Harris visited the border in June 2021.) Hardcore Democrats are going to vote for her no matter what. But people on the fence? They don’t know enough about her and Trump gave such a great speech at the convention that I think was enough to swing people. Harris really could have been something. She was their (the Democrats) next superstar, but they didn’t groom her. These last four years they didn’t do anything with her.”"
"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump

could be about to face off against a familiar foe he sparred with when he was in office: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Shapiro, now considered a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, built his national profile when he was the commonwealth's attorney general, filing challenges to Trump policies and battling his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Shapiro’s battles with Trump “were a huge part of raising his profile and cementing a real track record on a lot of important issues,” said J.J. Abbott, who at the time was a spokesman for then-Gov. Tom Wolf. Just days after he took office in 2017, Shapiro was part of the coalition of state attorneys general who opposed Trump's proposed travel ban on people entering the country from Muslim-majority countries. And as Trump left office four years later, Shapiro was heavily involved in efforts to push back against the many lawsuits questioning Biden's victory, including in Pennsylvania itself. “We did a lot of work together on a lot of different cases,” Brian Frosh, a Democrat who was Maryland’s attorney general at the time, said of Shapiro. “He’s very smart, very capable. He’s hard-working. He’s willing to take risks.” When he ran for governor in 2022, ""a big part of Shapiro’s appeal to voters was that he had taken on Trump and election deniers,"" Frosh added. Shapiro's Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, was himself an election denier who had traveled to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Frosh said Shapiro's investigation of sex abuse allegations against the Catholic Church was a blueprint for his own probe in Maryland. Shapiro is just one example of how politicians have used the previously sleepy position of attorney general in recent years to catapult themselves into high-profile political careers. Other examples include Harris herself, who was attorney general of California. The approach has worked for Republicans, too, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who were their states' attorneys general. The easiest way for newly appointed attorneys general to make names for themselves these days is simple: generate national headlines by opposing the president in high-profile litigation. That is exactly the approach Shapiro took. He helped coordinate Democratic attorneys general as they supported lawsuits against the travel ban filed by attorneys general in Washington state and Virginia. Democrats loudly condemned Trump's policy, saying in part that it discriminated on the basis of religion by targeting Muslims. The ban was implemented after Trump pledged during the campaign to implement ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" At the time, the newly elected Shapiro brushed off concerns that joining the legal effort could harm him politically in a state Trump had won in the 2016 election. ""This filing is about keeping our communities safe, protecting our economy, and upholding the rule of law,"" Shapiro said in a statement announcing the filing of one of the briefs against the travel ban. Courts blocked Trump's initial travel ban, allowing Shapiro and the other attorneys general to claim victory. (Trump later issued an amended travel ban, which Shapiro decided against challenging. It was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.) Shapiro, whose office declined to comment on his role as attorney general, continued to butt heads with Trump. One lawsuit he helped lead targeted a Trump administration effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act's so-called contraception mandate, which required employers to ensure that health insurance plans covered contraceptives. The administration issued a regulation that expanded religious and moral exemptions from the requirement. The Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in favor of Trump on a 7-2 vote. Shapiro found himself in the national spotlight again later that year as Trump and fellow Republicans fought in court both before and after the November election over voting-related issues. One element of the pro-Trump election-denier narrative centered on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to be received in the battleground state in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The move was backed by Democrats, including Shapiro. The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2020 declined to intervene in Pennsylvania at the request of Republicans, but that did not stop the idea that Democrats had run roughshod over elections laws from taking hold on the right. That led to a lawsuit Texas filed later in the year seeking to invalidate Biden's election wins in key swing states, including Pennsylvania. At the request of Shapiro and other state attorneys general, the Supreme Court quickly rejected that lawsuit, too. ""Our nation's highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process,"" Shapiro said at the time. His involvement in the 2020 election cases ""just solidified him as the Democratic front-runner and favorite"" for the 2022 governor's race, said David La Torre, a Republican consultant in the state. ""It certainly did him no harm,"" he added."
"Vice President Kamala Harris boards Air Force Two, Monday, July 22, 2024 at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool) It was not a smoke-filled room, but a Zoom meeting, where Pennsylvania’s delegates to the Democratic National Convention voted unanimously on Monday to back Vice President Kamala Harris’ quest to become the Democratic nominee for president. The emergency vote was held 23 hours after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid. State Rep. Izzy Smith-Wade-El, a Lancaster Democrat who serves as a delegate, said the mood among delegates at the brief meeting was enthusiastic. “I think we all support Vice President Harris,” he said. “I think when I look at it, both narratively and logistically, she’s the right fit for where we are.” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street, a state senator from Philadelphia, told reporters Sunday that Harris would be an “excellent president of the United States.” “I’ve talked to state chairs from across America and I’ve seen nothing but overwhelming support for the vice president,” Street said. Pennsylvania’s delegates, previously pledged to Biden after he carried 93% of Democratic primary votes in April, now consider themselves pledged to Harris, narrowing the already small window for a would-be challenger to join the race.  An unofficial Associated Press tally found Harris won the support of over 1,000 delegates from around the country as of Monday evening, more than half of the delegates necessary to secure the nomination. Biden threw his support behind Harris minutes after he dropped out of the race Sunday afternoon. The commonwealth’s entire Democratic congressional delegation, as well as its governor and lieutenant governor, were behind Harris by end of business Monday."

"Gov. Josh Shapiro gives his 2024 budget address at the Capitol in Harrisburg Feb. 6, 2024 (Commonwealth Media Services photo) He’s only been Pennsylvania’s governor for a year and a half and just got his second state budget wrapped, but Josh Shapiro already had a national profile for some of the cases he prosecuted during his tenure as the state’s attorney general.  Shapiro is one of the people considered most likely to join the Democrats’ 2024 ticket with President Joe Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday. He leads a critical battleground state with 19 electoral votes up for grabs.  Shapiro had continued to support Biden publicly in the aftermath of the president’s poor performance in the June 27 presidential debate, saying the morning after on cable news morning shows that Democrats should “stop worrying” and “start working.” But that hasn’t stopped speculation — which Shapiro has largely dismissed — that he is destined for bigger things within the Democratic Party, whether it’s now or sometime in the near future.  On Sunday, Shapiro released a statement praising Biden’s long career in politics. “President Biden is a patriot who has served our country honorably in the Senate, as Vice President, and as one of the most consequential presidents in modern history,” he said in a post to social media. “President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom. I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania — the Commonwealth that raised him.” He later released a statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. “The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency,” Shapiro said. “The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania — where this collective work began. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.” A Shapiro spokesman confirmed that the governor spoke with Harris on Sunday. Rising from a state House seat representing his hometown of Abington to the governor’s mansion, Shapiro built a reputation for being a hard worker and a skilled negotiator. And he has projected those attributes onto his administration’s brand with the slogan “Get S**t Done.”  “He’s had 20 years of being in government and that’s a lot of experience,” Neil Oxman, who served as a consultant for Shapiro’s first campaign. Shapiro touts simple achievements in state government such as cutting the time to register a new corporation from months to days and flipping the state’s reputation for lethargic government by reopening Interstate 95, a crucial mid-Atlantic artery, in 12 days after a gasoline tanker crash last June destroyed an overpass. And he offers grand designs for the future of Pennsylvania by reforming the state’s system of higher education, expanding workforce training and development opportunities and reinventing the commonwealth’s energy economy to meet carbon reduction goals while recognizing the role the state’s fossil fuel industries will continue to play for the foreseeable future. Berwood Yost, director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin & Marshall College, said Shapiro’s approval ratings, his 2022 gubernatorial election win by a 15% margin, and record as attorney general all make him one of the most recognized political figures in the key swing states for Democrats. “People view him as  … a moderate commonsense Democrat who tries to get things done,” Yost said, adding that his profile among Democratic leaders is also strong. “People wouldn’t be mentioning his name if he hadn’t already generated some buzz,” Yost said. “His brand is undoubtedly strong, particularly within the party, but it has the potential to be appealing to a broader swath of voters.” Shapiro was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2004 and served there until 2011. During his first tenure in Harrisburg, Shapiro demonstrated acumen for forging compromise. He helped to negotiate a play to put Rep. Denny O’Brien, a Republican backed by a reform-minded alliance of Democratic and GOP lawmakers, on the speaker’s rostrum in 2007. In doing so, Shapiro helped knock Rep. John Perzel, a Philadelphia GOP boss later convicted of using state resources for campaigns, from the speaker’s seat. O’Brien named Shapiro a co-chair of the newly formed Speaker’s Committee on Reform. After three terms in the House, Shapiro returned to Montgomery County, where he was elected to oversee a financially distressed government. According to his campaign biography, Shapiro erased a $10 million deficit and simplified the county’s investments to rescue its half-billion-dollar retirement fund. It was as the state’s attorney general, however, that Shapiro began to draw national and international headlines. In 2018 he released the results of a grand jury investigation that alleged widespread abuse of 1,000 children by some 300 “predator priests” in six of Pennsylvania’s eight Roman Catholic dioceses. In a scathing report, Shapiro said church leaders engaged in a “systematic cover up” over the course of eight decades to protect the institution, transferring abusers from one parish to another without disclosing their prior acts.  Shapiro opposed proposals by the dioceses to establish victims’ compensation funds, noting that the grand jury recommended lifting or creating exceptions to the criminal and civil statutes of limitations for abuse and saying that the church should not be “the arbiter of its own punishment.” While the legislature eliminated the criminal statute of limitations for abuse, it has been unable to complete legislation to allow older victims to sue their abusers and those who enabled them. Within a year of the report’s release, the dioceses paid $84 million to settle claims by 564 victims.  And he sued former President Donald Trump’s administration some two dozen times, including in 2019, to challenge a “gag rule” imposing restrictions on participants in the Title X family planning program. Shapiro also brokered a 2019 deal between two western Pennsylvania healthcare giants, UPMC and Highmark, who were at odds over terms to allow Highmark-insured patients to receive in-network care at UPMC facilities. Shapiro accused UPMC, the largest healthcare system in western Pennsylvania, of violating the state’s public charities law and of unfair trade practices. The two sides signed a 10-year agreement allowing patients to keep access to each other’s services just days before the previous agreement expired.  Shapiro’s 2022 run for governor came the same cycle that Democrat John Fetterman ran for the state’s open Senate seat, in an election year when candidates aligned with Trump fared relatively poorly. The U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade just a few months prior, was galvanizing for many Democrats, and Shapiro’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), was and is staunchly anti-abortion.  Mastriano, a retired U.S. Army colonel from south-central Pennsylvania, ran on a far-right platform in which he advocated restricting abortion access and cutting public school funding. He also promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said Shapiro’s campaign zeroed in on Mastriano’s weaknesses early in the campaign and didn’t let up. He also received endorsements from more than a dozen high-profile Republicans including former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Pennsylvania Congressmen Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood. “It was a textbook on campaigns that didn’t deviate from their game plan,” Borick said, adding that Shapiro is disciplined in his messaging and style. “He doesn’t make a lot of unforced errors in his politics.” His tenure as governor has not been without controversy. The first budget Shapiro negotiated, with a GOP-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House, was delayed nearly six months, as a protracted battle over school vouchers simmered through the summer into the fall. Senate Republicans blamed Shapiro for failing to secure the support of House Democrats, who killed the $100 million program.  Last August, Shapiro’s office paid $295,000 in public funds to settle a state employee’s sexual harassment complaint against his longtime aide and former Legislative Affairs Secretary Mike Vereb. The terms of the agreement came to light last October.  With the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin crucial to winning the presidential election, both the Biden and Trump campaigns have spent significant time and resources in the Keystone State, with only a few points separating the two in recent polls. However, following the June 27 debate, a growing number of Democrats called for Biden to step down from the ticket, in favor of  Harris or another candidate, like Shapiro.  A July 18 survey by Public Policy Polling found a Democratic ticket of Harris/Shapiro ahead of Trump and his running mate U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance by one point, while the Biden-Harris ticket trailed the GOP team by about four points. A Quinnipiac University poll in January found Shapiro with a 59% approval rating, well ahead of the 40% approval rating Biden had in the same poll. And in a 2022 Muhlenberg poll of a hypothetical presidential election between Shapiro and Trump, the governor led by 11% among Pennsylvania voters. “His resume is stellar for taking that next step,” Yost, of Franklin & Marshall said. “We just don’t know what that would look like.” If Shapiro were to stand as a choice for the presidential nomination in an open Democratic convention, he would be an attractive choice, he added. “He would be one of the leading candidates just given his record and the necessity of winning Pennsylvania for Democrats and his ability to appeal to the middle in the way his opponent, if he were to run against Trump, has struggled with,” Yost said. And although voters in Arizona or Wisconsin might never have heard his name, Shapiro’s brand of politics is well suited for a national audience, Borick said. “Pennsylvania … is a swing state for a reason,” Borick said. “It has one of the largest rural populations in the nation, it has large urban populations and booming suburbs. It mirrors the national landscape of American life.” Update: This story was updated Sunday July 21, 2024 at 3 p.m. after President Joe Biden announced he was bowing out of his reelection bid, again at 6:30 p.m with Shapiro’s statement endorsing Kamala Harris for president, and at 10 p.m. to add that Shapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday.

"President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race in an effort to unite the Democratic party and now he is refocusing his efforts on helping Vice President Kamala Harris win the nomination. NBC10’s Lauren Mayk asked officials questions many have at this time. Public policy professor and political analyst Larry Gerston also answers some of those what ifs on what happens next. In a move that stunned many, President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he would be dropping out of the presidential race. Not long after posting that note on social media, he endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris in his stead. In just moments after Biden made his announcement, officials and politicians across our region released statements on the decision. Taking to social media, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the President ""a patriot."" Dave McCormick, a Republican who is running to unseat Democratic Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, in a statement, used Biden's decision as an opportunity to attack his opponent. ""Joe Biden is not capable of serving as Commander-in-Chief. Bob Casey is very close to Biden — he’s known this — but in typical Casey fashion, he’s been weak in his refusal to admit to Pennsylvanians that Biden is simply not up to the job. Keeping his head down when times get tough, that's who Bob Casey is,"" McCormick wrote in a statement. By contrast, Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey posted a brief statement on X following President Biden's announcement, noting Biden's ""historic achievements."" For his part, in a statement following Biden's announcement, Pennsylvania Congressman Brendan F. Boyle (D-2nd dist.), said he was proud to be a supporter of Biden's. “President Joe Biden is a patriot. He selflessly put personal ambition aside to do what he thinks is best for our country,"" Boyle wrote in a statement. ""Today and every day, both in dark passages and bright days, I am always proud to be one of Joe Biden’s biggest supporters.” Across the Delaware River, Gov. Phil Murphy posted a thank you message to Biden on X. ""Thank you, President Biden, for always putting our country first,"" the Democratic two-term governor wrote. New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone (D-6th dist.) issued a statement noting the president made a selfless decision. “President Biden's decision to step back from the nomination reflects his selflessness as a leader. His legacy of putting his country first is underscored by more than fifty years of public service,"" Pallone wrote in a statement. ""I am grateful for his calm leadership while navigating the most challenging role on the planet, especially after four years of tumult and division sowed by Donald Trump. Now, our party must come together to defeat the authoritarian policies of the Republican nominee and ensure American democracy endures.” Also in New Jersey, Herb Conaway, the Democratic nominee for Congress in the state's Third Congressional District, issued a statement on President Biden’s decision to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders. ""Joe Biden is a man of integrity, decency and true public service. In 2020, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris brought us together to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme agenda. And over the last four years, the Biden-Harris Administration has delivered historic results for New Jersey on everything from lowering the cost of prescription drugs to investing in our infrastructure to creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs,"" Conaway wrote in a statement. ""Now, the President’s decision to pass the torch to the next generation of leaders is deeply courageous and selfless. I look forward to the President continuing to lead our country through the end of his term, and I look forward to strongly supporting our nominee who will stand up to Donald Trump and bring us together as Americans to defeat division and extremism."" New Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th dist.) said that Biden would be remembered as a ""towering figure."" “History will remember President Biden as a towering figure. A lifelong public servant. A historically successful president. And as a selfless leader who put the greater good of this country above himself,"" Watson wrote in a statement. ""President Biden’s decision to step aside is a selfless act of patriotism, putting the need to defend democracy ahead of his own personal ambition. It’s a stunning act of selflessness that is so often lacking in today’s politics. Thank you for everything you have done for our country, President Biden.” Delaware Gov. John Carney also took to social media to share his thoughts on President Biden's decision to step down. And, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker also commented on Biden's decision. She noted that she got to ""personally know President Joe Biden"" in her time in office and thanked him for his service to the country. “Since becoming Mayor, I have gotten to personally know President Joe Biden, and have seen up close that he is a decent, honorable public servant who has put the country first for his entire career, as a Senator from Delaware, where he was Pennsylvania’s ‘Third Senator,’ as Vice President, and now as President,"" Parker said. “His decision not to seek re-election for another term as President mirrors how he’s conducted himself his whole career: Put country first, ahead of personal interests. President Biden has been an invaluable partner to the Commonwealth and Philadelphia for a long time. Thanks to the Biden-Harris administration, Philadelphia has received over $638 Million in federal grants in just the 7 months since I’ve been Mayor. From SEPTA rail cars, to replacing aging gas & water infrastructure, to workforce development for jobs, and brownfields remediation of contaminated sites in underserved neighborhoods– all of Philadelphia – has benefitted significantly thanks to President Biden. ""His authenticity, his caring about Philadelphia in particular and cities in general, and his grasp of the important role intergovernmental cooperation plays in delivering government services in a way people can see, touch, and feel resonates with the people of this city. God bless President Joe Biden. We thank him for his service,"" Parker concluded. Shapiro, in a statement released later Sunday, made a move to endorse Kamala Harris for president. ""Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom. She has served the country honorably as Vice President and she is ready to be President,"" Shapiro said. Congressman Dwight Evans who represents the Northwest, West Philly and other parts of the city, issued a statement on Biden that said he is ""all in for Kamala Harris for President!"" ""...he stepped up again in 2020 to end the disastrous tenure of Donald Trump and clean up the mess and chaos that Trump left behind. President Biden and Vice President Harris have delivered for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the nation with accomplishments I've been proud to vote for in Congress, from the American Rescue Plan that helped us recover from Covid and the Trump recession, to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the historic clean-energy and health-care law also known as the Inflation Reduction Act. I strongly support Vice President Harris as our next nominee,"" Evans said. ""She is ready to unify the majority of Americans to defeat the extremist Trump-Vance ticket...I am all in for Kamala Harris for President!"" Philadelphia Democratic Party Chairman Bob Brady too threw his support behind Harris in a post on social media."
"In his first public appearance since endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president following President Joe Biden's decision not to seek a second term, Gov. Josh Shapiro declined to directly answer repeated questions about his political future. ""I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals,"" Shapiro said, reverting back to this answer several times when asked by reporters if he would accept the vice presidential nomination should Harris ask him to join her ticket. Harris has yet to officially secure the presidential nomination for the Democratic Party, but in the last 24 hours, prominent Democrats have quickly coalesced behind her candidacy. ""[Harris] has been preparing for this and she is ready to go,"" Shapiro said Monday. Alongside Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, Shapiro stopped by Castle Builders Supply & Trucking Monday to tout millions of dollars in federal funding for western Pennsylvania aimed at tackling climate change. But while Shapiro appeared in his official capacity as governor, questions about his political future loomed large over the event. Shapiro's name has been mentioned alongside Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper as potential contenders for running mates. ""She will now have to make an important decision as then-candidate Biden had to make,"" Shapiro said to reporters Monday. ""And it’s who to run with – who should be her running mate, a deeply personal decision and a decision that should be made, really, free from any political pressure."" Shapiro confirmed he spoke to both Biden and Harris on Sunday, shortly after Biden announced he would no longer campaign for re-election. Reporters asked Shapiro about the nature of his conversation with Harris. ""Our conversation was all about how we beat Donald Trump,"" Shapiro said. Later Monday, Shapiro stopped by a nearby Eat'n Park and spoke with constituents, reiterating his support for Harris. ""I think today would’ve been a pretty quick turnaround for anybody to come out and say that they were interested in the vice presidency,"" said Dr. Kristen Coopie, the director of pre-law at Duquesne University. Coopie noted that while speculation has run rampant about potential running mates, Harris has yet to officially be nominated. ""There’s a lot that has to happen to make her the official candidate,"" Coopie said. Coopie added that Harris will have to do a ""lot of thinking very quickly,"" given the fact that the convention is just four weeks away. ""She’s going to have to find somebody she’s comfortable with who would also be an asset to the administration,"" Coopie said.

"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- With President Biden dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, could Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro be a candidate for vice president on the Democratic ticket?  On Saturday, Shapiro made it clear that he wasn't getting into ""hypotheticals"" of jumping into the race, but things have changed. Now, with Biden officially out of the race, Shapiro is among several Democrats across the country who could join Vice President Kamala Harris on the ticket if she wins the Democratic nomination. Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore are among the names that have been floated as possible running mates for Harris. Hours after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, Shapiro endorsed Harris for president, saying in part: ""I've known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades – we've both been prosecutors, we've both stood up for the rule of law, we've both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom. She has served the country honorably as Vice President and she is ready to be President."" Shapiro, an Abington native, beat Republican Doug Mastriano in 2022 to win the election for Pennsylvania governor. Before that, Shapiro served as the Commonwealth's Attorney General under former Gov. Tom Wolf's administration from 2017-2023. He was also the Chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2012-16, a member of the board and a state Rep. in Pennsylvania. Shapiro hasn't officially said he has any interest in joining the race as a vice presidential candidate following Mr. Biden dropping out of the race.  After I-95 collapsed in Philadelphia, Shapiro was put in the national spotlight. Under Shapiro's administration, the highway was reopened 12 days after with a temporary roadway and the whole thing was live-streamed.  When asked about making a run for the White House in 2028 in a sit-down interview with CBS News Philadelphia in May, Shapiro said: ""No. Listen, man, I'm governor, and I'm proud to be governor. God willing, I'm going to be governor for a long time, as long as the good people of Pennsylvania will continue to have me. I've got a lot of work to do here, and I'm focused on doing that work."" A New York Times poll in May said Shapiro was popular with a third of former President Donald Trump supporters in Pennsylvania — one of the most important battleground states in this year's election.  ""Like President Biden, Vice President Harris will have the immense responsibility of choosing a Vice Presidential nominee,"" Philadelphia Democratic Party Chairman and Former Congressman Bob Brady said in a statement. ""Our Governor, Josh Shapiro, would be an excellent choice. His addition to the Democratic ticket would significantly boost our chances in Pennsylvania and in communities like ours across the country. As a governing partner, Josh's 'Get [expletive] Done' mentality and bipartisan track record are exactly what America wants and needs.""

"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he would not engage in “hypotheticals” over the Democratic ticket. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro on Saturday in Pittsburgh. Matt Freed/AP Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) faced a barrage of questions over whether he would join the Democratic ticket as he and EPA Administrator Michael Regan rolled out new funding to tackle climate change in the Keystone State. Regan was in the vital swing state after a historic shake-up in the White House race after President Joe Biden decided to withdraw from his reelection bid Sunday. Senior officials in his administration have been crisscrossing the country highlighting spending under major legislation the president secured, and his vice president, Kamala Harris, appears likely to be the Democrats’ nominee to face former President Donald Trump. Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s former attorney general who was elected governor in 2022, is considered to be one of the contenders for Harris’ running mate. After remarks at Monday’s event, reporters shouted questions at Shapiro about whether he would join Harris in her bid for the presidency. The governor noted he had endorsed Harris and spoken with her about defeating Trump. He, however, would not engage in “hypotheticals.” Congress. Legislation. Politics."
"Residents in Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, have weighed in on the president’s decision to drop his reelection bid against Donald Trump. The US leader sent political shockwaves around the country on Sunday (21 July) with a post on social media announcing that he was not accepting the Democrat nomination and “focus all his energies on his duties as president for the remainder of his term”, offering his full support and endorsement to Kamala Harris. Some Scranton locals expressed their shock about the decision but wished the president well with his health, while others praised Mr Biden for what they said was a smart choice to step aside."
Democratic voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania are contemplating the departure of President Biden from the campaign and the emergence of Vice President Kamala Harris. NBC News' Zinhle Essamuah spoke with four of them.
"President Joe Biden has officially dropped out of the 2024 Presidential Race, after several weeks of growing pressure to bow out. Twin States News spoke to residents in the Meridian Area, to see how they are feeling after hearing the news. A little over three months until the Presidential Election in November, and President Joe Biden has officially dropped out of the race for reelection. “Well why couldn’t he have dropped out four years ago?” Richard Whitehead said. “That was the right thing to do because of his age, and you know, health issues,” Edna Blanks said. President Biden made the announcement said to drop out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the new Democratic Nominee. The decision has caused mixed reactions among Americans and local residents. “It’s an honor to have a female to run as president, so I feel she’ll do a good job,” said Blanks. “He has showed on TV that he is not capable enough to do our government for another four years,” said Whitehead. “I’m kind of sorry to hear that, but I think the Vice President, I think she’ll be a wonderful candidate,” said Patricia Griffin. Despite mixed reactions on the president dropping out, residents agree they just want what’s best for the country. “Just do the right thing,” Blanks said. “Do better as far as everything that’s going on in the world, but I know God still has his hand on this world,” Griffin said. “Whoever is our president for the next four years needs to concentrate on the United States of America, and not other countries,” Whitehead said. As local residents voice their reactions and opinions about President Biden dropping out of the race, they all agree whoever the next president is needs to put the needs and concerns of the country first."
The governor’s first comments about Harris’ selection of a vice presidential candidate come as top Democrats in Pennsylvania tout him as the best candidate for the job.
"Josh Shapiro is known for his practical approach to politics and ability to work with both parties.  As things progress on the campaign front, you could be reading his name more.  Pressure is building on President Joe Biden to give up his seat at the top of the ticket in favor of someone - likely Kamala Harris - who would be a stronger opponent to the surging Donald Trump.  But, it means Democrats also need a solid pick for a vice presidential running mate.  That’s where Gov. Josh Shapiro potentially comes in.  Here’s a primer on the Pennsylvania Democratic governor.  The 51-year-old Josh Shapiro grew up in Pennsylvania and started his political career in the state House of Representatives, serving there for seven years until 2012 and then served as Pennsylvania's Attorney General from 2017 until he was elected governor in 2022.  Beyond his political resume, Shapiro is known for his dedication to his family. He and wife Lori Shapiro have four children: Sophia, Jonah, Max, and Reuben.  Shapiro is also a die-hard Philadelphia Phillies fan. In the political arena, Shapiro’s tenure as Attorney General was marked by his efforts to tackle the opioid crisis, protect consumers, and uphold civil rights.  As governor, he has focused on expanding access to education, improving healthcare, and fostering economic development.  Shapiro played a significant role in the response to the I-95 collapse in Philadelphia, ensuring swift action and coordination to reopen the crucial highway ahead of schedule. In recent polls, Shapiro has shown strong numbers compared to Vice President Kamala Harris, indicating his potential appeal as a vice-presidential candidate alongside her. "
"Now that President Joe Biden has decided not to seek reelection, Vermont's delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago are free to vote for whoever they want. On Monday night, Vermont's delegates unanimously pledged to support Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the Vermont Democratic Party. Vermont has 14 ""voting"" delegates at the convention, two alternates, and eight so-called superdelegates — elected officials and party leaders who only get to vote if no candidate wins a majority of ballots in the first round. Nationally, Democrats have been coalescing around Harris. Vermont Rep. Becca Balint, a superdelegate, quickly endorsed Harris after Biden's announcement Sunday. According to the DNC, Vermont has one of the youngest delegations in the country despite having one of the oldest populations. Nine of the 14 voting delegates are under 37, and another four are under 26."
"A potential Trump v. Harris race puts two competing ideas of Christianity on display Following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will no longer seek re-election in November, the 2024 presidential race juxtaposes two very different versions of Christianity: Donald Trump brandishes a performative rendition of the Christian faith as a political prop to advance authoritarian theocracy, while Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to take his place as the Democratic nominee, practices the Christian faith she was raised in, while embracing her interfaith family.  In doing so, Harris embodies our nation’s founding ideal of religious freedom and models a Christian commitment to religious pluralism.  Although he has reportedly mocked his conservative Christian leaders behind their backs, was not active in church before running for president and says he’s never asked God for forgiveness, Trump has manufactured mass far-right devotion among his base through moves like overturning Roe v. Wade. Surviving an assassination attempt will only heighten MAGA zealotry, as we saw with the surge of Christian nationalist narrative claiming Trump survived only by the will of God.  Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. Harris grew up attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. “I was raised to live my faith,” she said at the National Baptist Convention, USA, Annual Meeting in 2022. “Marching for civil rights, my parents pushed me in a stroller. That was faith in action.” I’ve witnessed her put her faith in action on the national stage. Four days after Biden picked her to be his running mate in 2020, I was invited by the Biden-Harris campaign to attend a meeting between her and national faith leaders. We heard directly from the Rev. Dr. Amos Brown, her pastor at Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. It was clear from the very beginning of her national political career that she would not shy away from talking about her Baptist convictions. Harris once served as Rev. Brown’s campaign manager when he ran for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. “She is an encourager; she encourages all people regardless of their social station in life,” Rev. Brown shared with Baptist news outlet Word&Way. “She is a role model for womanhood, and just human decency and dignity at its best.”  Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. “Just think, after slavery was outlawed in our country, the founders of this very convention came together to protect the freedom of worship,” she said at the National Baptist Convention. “As Black people in our nation battled racist laws and ideologies, men and women of the cloth were the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in America. And they, then, following the teachings of Christ, built coalitions of people of all faiths and races and walks of life, because they understood and knew the importance of the collective.” “I can trace my belief in the importance of public service back to learning the parable of the good Samaritan and other biblical teachings about looking out for our neighbors,” she said in a Religion News Service interview in 2020.  “Ever since I was a girl, church has not only been a place where I draw strength, it’s been a place for reflection, a place to study the teachings of the Lord and to feel grounded in a complex world,” she told RNS. “Church still plays that role for me. And I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need.” Harris grew up in an interfaith family and chose to form an interfaith family as an adult. Her mother, an immigrant from India, took her to visit Hindu temples growing up. Harris has said this teaches her “to see that all faiths teach us to pursue justice.” If elected, Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff wouldn’t just be the first person to hold the title of first gentleman. He’d also the first Jewish spouse of a president.  “From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” Harris said about the Hindu and Jewish influences in her life.  Emhoff has also been a leader in the Biden-Harris administration at fostering interfaith dialogue and collaboration. I heard him speak at an interfaith iftar at the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2022 during Ramadan. Harris and Emhoff hosted an Eid al-Adha celebration in 2023, the first Eid celebration at the vice president’s residence.  One of the most exciting aspects of Harris’ potential candidacy is that she doesn’t shy away from making the religious case for abortion rights, meeting head on Trump’s alliance of Christian nationalist groups pushing to outlaw abortion on so-called religious claims.  Harris spoke on this matter at the National Baptist Convention: “As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And she will choose, in consultation with her pastor or her priest, or a doctor and her loved ones. But the government should not be making that decision.” Harris’ boldness is representative, as most Christians in the United States support abortion rights.  In 2021, Rev. Lauren Jones Mayfield was invited to the White House to participate in a roundtable discussion on reproductive health care with Harris. “Harris honored my religious voice as I intended for her to hear it, a deep valuing of American religious liberty and reproductive freedoms,” Jones Mayfield told me. “The vice president made clear her own support for reproductive health for all Americans alongside her ongoing commitments to religious liberty. For those of us who engage in reproductive rights activism of our faith, not in spite of it, Harris honored our collective, clerical voice that celebrates the American right for a patient to choose their best course of medical treatment with their doctor, family and faith leader if it’s so desired.” Rooted in the Black Church tradition, deeply informed and inspired by her interfaith family, and a trailblazer for reproductive freedom, Kamala Harris’ Christian faith is the antithesis of Donald Trump’s Christian nationalism, in which the Christian faith is wielded as a tool to oppress, exclude and limit basic rights of people who believe or pray differently.  If elected president, she would make history on multiple fronts: the first female president, the second Black president, and the first president of South Asian descent. She’ll also be a role model for confidently living out your faith in public while respecting others’ religious values.

"Harris needs 1,976 votes to secure the nomination and it seems like she will meet that mark, according to an updating tally of Democratic delegate support. The nearly 4,000 delegates who pledged to support President Biden at the Democratic National Convention remained committed to him even as those in his party called for him to step aside. But now that he has decided not to run for reelection, the delegates are free to vote for any candidate."
"(WHTM) – The Pennsylvania Delegation to the Democratic National Convention has unanimously endorsed Kamala Harris for President of the United States. The vote came after a virtual meeting on Monday afternoon of the 185 delegates elected during the spring primary to attend the convention in Chicago in August. Delegates had been pledged to President Joe Biden prior to him dropping out of the race on Sunday, but now Democrats nationwide are pledging their support to Harris. “President Joe Biden has a history of putting America first over a career spanning more than half a century. President Biden created over 15 million jobs, brought the economy back with historic investments in infrastructure, and developed consequential legislation to help Pennsylvanians and residents of every other state in our nation,” stated Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street. “There is a tremendous amount of excitement in seeing Vice President Kamala Harris become the nominee of the Democratic Party,” added Street. “More than $66.9 million was raised through ActBlue yesterday, breaking the single-day record for dollars raised. Vice President Harris will be able to take the historic success of the Biden-Harris Administration and carry it forward under her leadership, vision, and intellect.” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is rumored to be among the list of potential running mates for Harris, publicly endorsed her on Sunday. “As Pennsylvania Democrats, we have a unique responsibility to defend our freedoms and our democracy — one that has been handed down to us from our ancestors 248 years ago in the halls of power in Philadelphia. I’ve known Vice President Harris for twenty years, have watched her exemplary work as a prosecutor, a Senator, and now VP, and I know she is ready to serve as our president,” said Governor Shapiro on Monday. “I am proud to have asked Pennsylvania Democrats to put our support behind the Vice President’s campaign today and we are ready to get to work to deliver Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.” Harris has also received endorsements from Lt. Governor Austin Davis, Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and the nine Pennsylvania Democrats in the House of Representatives. Election Day is November 5, 2024.

"HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s delegation to the Democratic National Convention on Monday voted unanimously to support Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee to replace President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race over the weekend. Sen. Jay Costa, a convention delegate, said the meeting took place at 1 p.m. Monday. Mr. Costa also said he doesn’t anticipate any other nationally known Democratic heavyweights will compete with Ms. Harris for the nomination, and he also expected support for Ms. Harris to be forthcoming from many other Democratic organizations in the state. Mr. Costa, an Allegheny County resident and the top Democrat in the state Senate, said Ms. Harris is “the right person for the job” and was Democrats’ best option. Democrats in general, he said, have been lacking in enthusiasm for the presidential race and Mr. Biden’s endorsement of Ms. Harris “flipped the switch” on that dynamic overnight. Reverberations from Mr. Biden’s weekend political bombshell were felt among state leaders Monday even as they continued to assess the aftermath of the attempted assassination the previous weekend of former President Donald Trump in Butler County. Prominent in the former topic and having a strong interest in the second topic was Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has been mentioned repeatedly as a possible running mate for Ms. Harris and even as a potential convention draftee pick for president. A spokesperson for Mr. Shapiro, who is midway through his second year as governor, did not immediately provide answers to questions Monday morning. At an event in Pittsburgh later in the day, the governor demurred when asked about a possible national run, saying Ms. Harris has a ""deeply personal decision"" to make and that he wouldn’t “engage in hypotheticals."" Top Republicans in the state Legislature criticized the notion of Mr. Shapiro seeking the vice presidency. The Democratic governor previously served stints as state attorney general, state representative and Montgomery County commissioner. Mr. Costa said the vice presidential slot was not discussed during the delegates’ meeting Monday. Prior to the meeting, Mr. Costa said Mr. Shapiro had a “very successful record” as governor and “has the capability” to hold one of the national posts. Concerning the possibility of Mr. Shapiro being added to a potential ticket topped by Ms. Harris, Mr. Costa said, “He is one of a number of folks who are being considered.” The mere fact that Mr. Shapiro is under consideration for a place on the ticket, Mr. Costa said, speaks well of how Pennsylvania has been run in the past 18 months. He ticked off many items worthy of praise in the just-completed state budget, led by the $1.1 billion increase in spending for K-12 education. Other Democrats have praised deep involvement by his administration in the budget negotiations, which put a complete state spending plan in place four months earlier than last year. Mr. Shapiro is the only governor in the nation working with a divided state legislature, with the House controlled by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans. In a midday news release, the Shapiro administration said that with the recent budget completion, Mr. Shapiro ""has proven once again that he can work with both parties to get stuff done and deliver real results for Pennsylvanians."" Another top Democrat in Harrisburg, House Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, on Sunday issued a statement of thanks to Mr. Biden, whom he said “has served the nation honorably for decades with kindness, empathy, and decency.” Mr. Bradford added that Mr. Biden “led the nation out of a very dark time, and his policies showed us the path out of a worldwide pandemic. He built an incredible economy, strengthened our infrastructure, and created a brighter future for working families.” Top Republicans, asked about the potential involvement of Mr. Shapiro in a national ticket, lambasted the concept. Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, R-Westmoreland, said Mr. Shapiro has been aiming at a spot in national politics ever since he was sworn in as governor. She said she didn’t see how Mr. Shapiro could run for a national office and still pay attention to Pennsylvania. She said it has been “difficult to work with him” because of what Ms. Ward described as Mr. Shapiro’s repeatedly taking positions in order to avoid angering the extreme left of his party. And even though Mr. Shapiro often highlights the fact he must work with a divided Legislature, Ms. Ward said it gives the governor cover when he does not want to support a bill from one side or the other. Asked if she trusted him, Ms. Ward said, “If he tells me he is going to do something, I don’t trust that.” Rep. Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster and the minority leader in the House, said “there is a lot that the governor could be focusing on here, rather than nationally.” He said that even though this year’s budget was not nearly as late as the previous one, he believed Mr. Shapiro’s budget performance was “0 for 2” because the most recent one included what Mr. Cutler described as a complete elimination of the budget surplus. On the Trump assassination attempt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, said Ms. McClinton was “confident that the FBI and Congress have the tools necessary for comprehensive investigations,” including the cooperation of Pennsylvania State Police and local law enforcement. Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for House Democratic Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, issued a similar statement. Mr. Cutler, on the other hand, said he has introduced a resolution in the House to form a bipartisan committee to probe the actions of state and local law enforcement, as well as their coordination with federal agencies, on the day of the shooting. “Pennsylvania is a political battleground state that will be the epicenter of many high-level campaign events during the remainder of the 2024 election season,” Mr. Cutler said. “It is imperative we identify what happened from a state and local perspective on July 13, as we seek to perfect our effectiveness at keeping citizens and candidates safe as they host campaign events in Pennsylvania.” Mr. Cutler noted a number of upcoming high-profile events in the state, including the NFL draft in Pittsburgh, soccer World Cup events in Philadelphia, and the nation’s 250th anniversary celebration. Ms. Ward said “obviously, something went terribly wrong” and it was clear more security would need to be in place at future events."
"BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Local Democrats took Sunday's news of President Joe Biden ending his bid for reelection as a moment to thank him. After weeks of speculation and scrutiny about Biden's fitness and future, messages of ""Thank you, Mr. President"" were scattered across social media. ""Four years ago, Joe Biden saved democracy and this country by running for president,"" said state Rep. Mike Schlossberg, D-Lehigh, on X. ""Today, he’ll do it again, by not running. Thank you, Mr. President."" Aidan Levinson, a Pennsylvania delegate for the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago, said on Facebook he feels ""grateful"" to Biden for his accomplishments and ""his unparalleled record of accomplishment."" ""He saved our country once, and I know he won’t stop fighting to save it again. Thank you, Mr. President,"" said Levinson, of Upper Milford Township. ""This is not the responsibility I wanted to have as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, but I will be prepared to take on this weighty responsibility. Gov. Josh Shapiro — his name is among those as potential vice president nominees — took to X less than an hour after Biden's announcement. He called Biden a patriot and applauded the ""incredible amount"" of work he accomplished over the past four years. In a statement later, without acknowledging speculation he could be in the mix, the Pennsylvania governor issued his own full-throated endorsement of Harris. ""The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency,"" Shapiro said. ""The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania — where this collective work began."" U.S. Sen. Bob Casey paid tribute to Biden, calling him a ""patriot who has always put our country first,"" in a statement posted to X. ""President Biden has always dedicated himself to improving the lives of Americans,"" said Casey, who, like Biden, is from Scranton. ""He deserves our gratitude for his historic achievements, including rebuilding our economy after the pandemic and delivering the largest infrastructure investment in modern history."" U.S. Rep. Susan Wild, D-Lehigh Valley, issued a statement also commending the president for his exemplary ""patriotism and selflessness."" She endorsed Harris in leading the Democratic ticket in the presidential election. ""I join Americans across the country in recognizing President Joe Biden's extraordinary career in public service,"" Wild said. Questions about Biden exploded after his poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump on June 27. Party leaders worried Biden's lagging poll performance and place at the top of the Democratic ticket would hamper Democrats farther down the ballot. Wild also thanked those who reached out over the past several weeks as concerns raised for the current president and his bid for reelection. ""I continue to keep their concerns at the forefront of every decision I make,"" she said in the statement. Casey and Wild are also seeking re-election in November. Casey's opponent, Republican Dave McCormick, issued a statement saying Biden is not capable to serve as commander-in-chief. ""Bob Casey is very close to Biden — he’s known this — but in typical Casey fashion, he’s been weak in his refusal to admit to Pennsylvanians that Biden is simply not up to the job,"" McCormick said. ""Keeping his head down when times get tough, that's who Bob Casey is. As a veteran and an American, I believe our troops deserve a commander-in-chief who is fully capable of doing the job — and Casey’s refusal to stand up for them throughout President Biden’s obvious decline is despicable."" State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who is running against Wild for the Lehigh Valley's congressional seat, issued a statement of his own: ""The pressure campaign from Democratic donors and D.C. elites worked in pushing out Joe Biden, overruling the votes of 14 million Democratic Primary voters,"" said Mackenzie, R-Lehigh. ""Donald Trump and Republicans highlighted the failures of Democrats like Joe Biden and Susan Wild ... at the RNC Convention, and whoever Democrats install as their nominee will continue to have to run away from that failed record that is hurting everyday Americans."" In Allentown, state Rep. Josh Siegel commended the Biden administration as ""the most legislatively successful since Lyndon Johnson,"" citing prescription drug cost reductions and union labor support, among others. Siegel, D-Lehigh, said the announcement only changes the nominee — Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris — not the goal of ""defeating a Republican ticket,"" and ideals. Wild also expressed her support for Harris in a statement, calling her ""an accomplished and exceptional public servant."" Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk, who welcomed Biden to Lehigh Valley International Airport for a visit earlier this year, saluted him on social media. ""President Biden has been there for our Commonwealth and for Allentown,"" Tuerk said. ""He has convened Pennsylvania leaders over and over to consult with us on what we need to improve the lives of our residents, and always kept the Keystone State in his heart."""
"In a show of party unity, state convention delegations have declared their support for Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee. These endorsements represent more than enough delegates to clinch the party's nomination. Ms. Harris most likely has more support than these declarations indicate. Individual delegates have said they intend to vote for Ms. Harris, but their state delegations have not yet collectively done the same. The state party endorsements represent 73 percent of the 3,949 delegates who will vote on the first ballot at the party convention. There are additional unpledged delegates, also known as superdelegates, who will vote only if no candidate receives a majority in the first round of voting. State party endorsements are not binding and do not necessarily mean that individual delegates must vote for Ms. Harris. According to party rules, the delegates who previously pledged to support Mr. Biden can vote for any candidate now that he has withdrawn from the race. Most state delegations listed below voted unanimously among those present to support Ms. Harris. *Source for delegation size is The Green Papers. Size of delegation does not include superdelegates.

"CARLISLE, Pa. — With President Biden out of the 2024 race for the White House, all eyes are now on his vice president, Kamala Harris. Harris quickly followed the president’s Sunday announcement with one of her own, saying she intends to earn and win the Democratic nomination in his place. “It’s the logical way to proceed,"" said John E. Jones III, president of Dickinson College and a former federal judge, who also served under Gov. Tom Ridge in Pennsylvania. ""It’s not a done deal but it makes perfect sense.” Many are now wondering who would complete that Democratic ticket. “I would think even now she has a pretty good idea of which way she wants to go,"" said Jones. ""This wasn’t totally unexpected.” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is one of several names Harris is reportedly considering as her vice president. Shapiro endorsed Harris on Sunday, shortly after she announced her intentions to run for president. FOX43 sat down with Jones to talk about the potential of the Commonwealth's governor joining a presidential ticket. Jones has known Shapiro for decades. “I’m not surprised he’s in the governor’s chair and I’m not surprised he’s being considered for this,"" said Jones. ""I think he would check a huge number of boxes should Vice President Harris see fit to bring him onto the ticket.” Jones explains if Shapiro were to enter the race, he would be able to continue his duties as governor while campaigning. “It is a tradition in many states including Pennsylvania that when the governor travels overseas and if he’s out of state for extended periods of time, he delegates to the lieutenant governor to sort of ‘watch the store’ so to speak,"" explained Jones. Shapiro would not have to resign unless he were to win,  in which case the state’s lieutenant governor, Austin Davis would step into the role. “He certainly would have to by the time his right arm would go up in the air and he would be sworn in as vice president,"" said Jones. If that were to happen, then the Senate President Pro Tempore would take the position of Lieutenant Governor. That position is currently held by Republican Senator Kim Ward. On Monday, Shapiro fielded questions from reporters while speaking at an event with the EPA in western Pennsylvania. He would not answer questions about whether he would accept an invitation from Harris, if she asked him to be her running mate.  Shapiro did confirm he spoke with both Harris and President Biden on Sunday and said he is going to do everything in his power to ensure she wins in November. Meanwhile, several top Democrats in Pennsylvania are already publicly backing Shapiro as Harris's VP pick, including House Speaker Joanna McClinton and Rep. Jordan Harris of Philadelphia."
"Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2023 at his inauguration in Harrisburg. COMMONWEALTH MEDIA SERVICES The dust has barely settled on President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but with the Democratic Party quickly consolidating around Kamala Harris to be the party’s presidential nominee, there’s already plenty of speculation about who will be Harris’ running mate. One of the names consistently mentioned by both media and politicos is Gov. Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s first-term governor who has also served two terms as state attorney general.  Below, City & State takes a look at some of the early chatter around a potential Harris-Shapiro presidential ticket. 1. Pennsylvania Democratic leaders are pushing for a Harris-Shapiro ticket Some of Pennsylvania’s top Democrats are already publicly backing Shapiro as a potential VP pick for Harris.  Bob Brady, the former Member of Congress who currently chairs the Philadelphia Democratic Party, said in a statement on Sunday that Shapiro would be an “excellent” running mate for Harris. “Like President Biden, Vice President Harris will have the immense responsibility of choosing a Vice Presidential nominee. Our Governor, Josh Shapiro, would be an excellent choice,” Brady said. “His addition to the Democratic ticket would significantly boost our chances in Pennsylvania and in communities like ours across the country. As a governing partner, Josh’s ‘Get Sh*t Done’ mentality and bipartisan track record are exactly what America wants and needs.” Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton also backed a potential Harris-Shapiro ticket over the weekend. In a post on X, McClinton cited Shapiro’s electoral success in Pennsylvania as a major reason why, in her eyes, he would make a solid pick.  2. BetOnline gives Shapiro the best odds to land VP slot The online gambling company BetOnline currently gives Shapiro the best odds to be Harris’ pick for vice president. In a list that includes Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and George Clooney, Shapiro still retains the best odds of landing the VP slot, according to the site.  Pennsylvania politicians react to President Biden campaign exit Opinion: With Biden out, Kamala Harris can make history with her own VP pick 3. Shapiro outperformed Biden in Pennsylvania in 2020 Shapiro has found repeated electoral success in Pennsylvania throughout his political career, often outperforming presidential candidates in the state, according to official state election returns. During the 2016 presidential election Shapiro outperformed both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump. Clinton secured 2,926,441 votes in 2016, compared to Trump’s 2,970,733 votes. Meanwhile, Shapiro pulled in 3,057,010 votes.  In 2020, Shapiro also outperformed the winner of that contest, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, by a little more than 3,000 votes. Biden received 3,458,229 votes in 2020, while Shapiro finished with 3,461,472 votes in the Keystone State.  4. A recent poll showed a Harris-Shapiro ticket running 1 point ahead of the Trump-Vance ticket There’s already been some polling looking at the potential performance of a Harris-Shapiro ticket. A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling and first reported by Politico shows a Harris-Shapiro ticket polling one point ahead of the Trump-Vance ticket in Pennsylvania, which could be enticing for Harris as she looks to shore up support in key battleground states.  The poll also explores a Harris-Whitmer ticket, and the results show Harris and Trump tied at 46% in Michigan under those circumstances.

"Both Democratic members of Congress representing Monroe County have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race. “Vice President Harris is more than ready to unify our party and make a sharp, determined case for what’s on the ballot in November. She is a fierce advocate for working families, women’s rights, and our democratic values,” U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright said in a Monday morning statement. He represents the 8th District, which includes most of Monroe County, all of Pike, Lackawanna and Wayne counties and part of Luzerne.

"US Vice President Kamala Harris and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro react during a visit to the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024 | Photo: Reuters/Kevin Mohatt In a recent segment, CNN political commentators Anderson Cooper and John King sparked controversy while discussing potential vice presidential candidates for Kamala Harris. During the conversation, King remarked on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as a possible choice, stating, ""He's Jewish. There could be some risks with putting him on the ticket."" This comment has raised eyebrows and ignited debate about religious bias in American politics. The suggestion that a candidate's Jewish faith could be seen as a liability, particularly in progressive circles, has led to criticism from various quarters. According to the Jewish Chronicle, Shapiro, born in 1973 in Kansas City, Missouri, is an observant Conservative Jew whose faith deeply influences his personal and public life. Raised in a Jewish household that emphasized faith and service, Shapiro keeps kosher and celebrates Shabbat with his family, though he's not believed to be Shomer Shabbat. His Jewish education at Akiba Hebrew Academy (now Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy) and early involvement in the movement to free Soviet Jewry shaped his cultural identity. Shapiro's commitment to his faith extends to his adult life, where he and his wife Lori are active in their synagogue and send their children to Jewish day schools. Shapiro, a strong supporter of Israel, has advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, believing both sides have missed opportunities for peace in recent decades, according to Forward. While backing Israel, he was not hesitant to voice criticism, having called Prime Minister Netanyahu ""a failed leader"" for embracing right-wing policies and pushing controversial judicial reforms before October 2023. Regarding the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Shapiro opposed premature ceasefire calls while Hamas remains in power. He also supported anti-BDS legislation, signaling his commitment to Israel's interests in US policy. Shapiro has made numerous personal visits to the country.

"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump could be about to face off against a familiar foe he sparred with when he was in office: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Shapiro, now considered a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, built his national profile when he was the commonwealth's attorney general, filing challenges to Trump policies and battling his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Shapiro’s battles with Trump “were a huge part of raising his profile and cementing a real track record on a lot of important issues,” said J.J. Abbott, who at the time was a spokesman for then-Gov. Tom Wolf. Just days after he took office in 2017, Shapiro was part of the coalition of state attorneys general who opposed Trump's proposed travel ban on people entering the country from Muslim-majority countries. And as Trump left office four years later, Shapiro was heavily involved in efforts to push back against the many lawsuits questioning Biden's victory, including in Pennsylvania itself. “We did a lot of work together on a lot of different cases,” Brian Frosh, a Democrat who was Maryland’s attorney general at the time, said of Shapiro. “He’s very smart, very capable. He’s hard-working. He’s willing to take risks.” When he ran for governor in 2022, ""a big part of Shapiro’s appeal to voters was that he had taken on Trump and election deniers,"" Frosh added. Shapiro's Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, was himself an election denier who had traveled to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Frosh said Shapiro's investigation of sex abuse allegations against the Catholic Church was a blueprint for his own probe in Maryland. Shapiro is just one example of how politicians have used the previously sleepy position of attorney general in recent years to catapult themselves into high-profile political careers. Other examples include Harris herself, who was attorney general of California. The approach has worked for Republicans, too, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who were their states' attorneys general. The easiest way for newly appointed attorneys general to make names for themselves these days is simple: generate national headlines by opposing the president in high-profile litigation. That is exactly the approach Shapiro took. He helped coordinate Democratic attorneys general as they supported lawsuits against the travel ban filed by attorneys general in Washington state and Virginia. Democrats loudly condemned Trump's policy, saying in part that it discriminated on the basis of religion by targeting Muslims. The ban was implemented after Trump pledged during the campaign to implement ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" At the time, the newly elected Shapiro brushed off concerns that joining the legal effort could harm him politically in a state Trump had won in the 2016 election. ""This filing is about keeping our communities safe, protecting our economy, and upholding the rule of law,"" Shapiro said in a statement announcing the filing of one of the briefs against the travel ban. Courts blocked Trump's initial travel ban, allowing Shapiro and the other attorneys general to claim victory. (Trump later issued an amended travel ban, which Shapiro decided against challenging. It was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.) Shapiro, whose office declined to comment on his role as attorney general, continued to butt heads with Trump. One lawsuit he helped lead targeted a Trump administration effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act's so-called contraception mandate, which required employers to ensure that health insurance plans covered contraceptives. The administration issued a regulation that expanded religious and moral exemptions from the requirement. The Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in favor of Trump on a 7-2 vote. Shapiro found himself in the national spotlight again later that year as Trump and fellow Republicans fought in court both before and after the November election over voting-related issues. One element of the pro-Trump election-denier narrative centered on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to be received in the battleground state in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The move was backed by Democrats, including Shapiro. The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2020 declined to intervene in Pennsylvania at the request of Republicans, but that did not stop the idea that Democrats had run roughshod over elections laws from taking hold on the right. That led to a lawsuit Texas filed later in the year seeking to invalidate Biden's election wins in key swing states, including Pennsylvania. At the request of Shapiro and other state attorneys general, the Supreme Court quickly rejected that lawsuit, too. ""Our nation's highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process,"" Shapiro said at the time. His involvement in the 2020 election cases ""just solidified him as the Democratic front-runner and favorite"" for the 2022 governor's race, said David La Torre, a Republican consultant in the state. ""It certainly did him no harm,"" he added. Lawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News."
"CNN Correspondent John King said on air on Sunday night that “There could be some risk” if Kamala Harris chooses the Jewish Governor Josh Shapiro as a running mate - causing significant outrage among well-known Jewish figures. ""He’s a first-term governor, he’s Jewish, there could be some risks in putting him on the ticket, but certainly some of our voters here in Pennsylvania said, ‘Hey, we like Gov. Shapiro, give him a look,'” King said. King reportedly converted to Judaism after marrying his wife, and fellow CNN host, Dana Bash, according to the Jewish Chronicle.  Expert suspects occular capability of Iranian-designed Hezbollah drone Lawyer and CEO of the International Legal Forum, Arsen Ostrovsky, commented, “It says a lot about the state of American politics, and perhaps especially in progressive circles, that one of the ‘cons’ of Kamala Harris selecting Gov. Josh Shapiro as her VP, is that he is Jewish and the pushback this might receive.” Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state's attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris' own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November. Shapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter. ""I've known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades - we've both been prosecutors, we've both stood up for the rule of law, we've both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support,"" he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that she would ""perfect our union, protect democracy and advance real freedom."" Shapiro is Pennsylvania’s third Jewish governor and is an observant Conservative Jew. Shapiro has been outspoken in his support of Israel’s right to defend itself in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel. The Pennsylvania governor has endorsed Harris, claiming “The contrast in this race could not be clearer, the road to victory in November runs through Pennsylvania.”"
"PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro appears to be emerging as a top pick to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate for the 2024 presidential election. ABC News' Martha Raddatz reported Tuesday morning that while the vetting process is just starting, an administration official said that Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are the two leading candidates. Sources tell ABC News that Harris called Shapiro on Sunday after she officially launched her campaign for the presidency. On Monday, Shapiro made his first public appearance in Pittsburgh at an event for the EPA after that phone call. ""We spoke only about beating Donald Trump,"" the governor noted. Shapiro repeatedly declined on Monday to say whether he would accept an offer to be Harris' running mate, telling reporters he would ""not engage in hypotheticals."" ""This is a deeply personal decision the vice president will make. She will make it on her own timetable and on her own timeline,"" he said. Kelly is a 60-year-old former astronaut and Navy captain who is married to former congresswoman Gabby Giffords. He won his Senate seat in 2022. Shapiro has been seen in a number of stories that made national news in the past year. RELATED: Who could Kamala Harris pick as VP if she wins the Democratic nomination?

Everywhere else, it's either all Republican or all Democrat -- from governor to House, to assembly, to delegates, to the Senate. He has done a phenomenal job."" Gov. Shapiro, 51, has also been a loyal surrogate for Biden. He has won three statewide races: two as attorney general and one as governor. He also served as a Montgomery County Commissioner during his early days in politics. ""Pa. is really the key state to this year's presidential and senatorial election,"" Sen. Chris Coons (D - Delaware) noted. Shapiro says in the meantime, his focus will be on the commonwealth. If selected, Shapiro would be allowed to remain governor while running and only has to give up the office if he wins and is sworn in as vice president. Shapiro issued a statement Sunday endorsing Harris and saying he would do everything he could to get her elected. McClinton is also a super delegate and has joined a growing chorus of Democratic leaders backing Shapiro for Harris' running mate pick. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign, is another who is embracing Shapiro as a potential VP pick. ""I think he's a capable, talented, and an outstanding statewide leader and I do hope VP Harris will consider him,"" Coons said. Other potential VP candidates include Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker.

"Since US President Joe Biden announced he will no longer seek re-election, questions have emerged over who Kamala Harris will pick as her vice-presidential running mate if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee for the 2024 election. One potential candidate is Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who was quick to endorse Harris for president with several bookies putting him as odds on favourite to join her on the Democrat ticket.  Other names that have been floated as possible running mates for Harris include Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, Maryland governor Wes Moore and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg. However, according to a poll conducted by BlueLabs, Shapiro was shown as the candidate who performed the strongest and is reportedly already being vetted by top Democrat donors as Harris's running mate. The New Arab takes a look at who is Josh Shapiro and where he stands on Israel and Palestine. Shapiro was born in 1973 into a Masorti Jewish household and attended a Jewish day school. According to Israeli media, he and his mother were active in the Free Soviet Jewry movement, which campaigned for the right of Jews in the Soviet Union to emigrate. If chosen, Shapiro would be the first Jewish candidate for Vice President since Joe Lieberman’s unsuccessful run with Democratic nominee Al Gore in 2000. After graduating from law at Georgetown, Shapiro was elected in 2020 as Pennsylvania Attorney General where he led investigations into sexual abuse in the Catholic church and also tackled issues regarding education, healthcare access and abortion rights. Shapiro quickly travelled up through Pennsylvania government to his eventual successful run for governor of the state in 2023. Despite Shapiro's support for liberal causes and policies, his staunch support for Israel amid the brutal war on Gaza has attracted huge attention in recent months, This is significant given Biden's strong support for Israel could lose him votes in key swing states like Michigan, which has a significant Arab and Muslim American population, as well as among younger voters, people of colour, and progressives.  In December 2023, a few months after Israel launched its war on Gaza, Shapiro reiterated his support for Israel's military’s actions, which has so far killed at least 39,000 people. ""Israel not only has a right, they have a responsibility to rid the region of Hamas and the terror that Hamas can perpetrate,"" he said at the time. Some have accused Shapiro of stifling free speech, after he ordered state employees to avoid ""scandalous"" conduct over pro-Gaza protests. He also quietly revised his administration’s code of conduct, so that ""scandalous or disgraceful behaviour"" could result in being disciplined or termination, with pro-Palestinian employees thought to be the target of this policy. Pro-Palestine and Muslim American groups raised alarm over the decision, saying it could be unconstitutional and curtail free speech. Shapiro has also been criticised for refusing to call for a ceasefire in Gaza despite children being among the biggest victims of the assault. The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) issued a statement in April claiming that his words and actions have created much harm in Muslim, Arab and pro-Palestine communities. ""At a time when governors of California and New Jersey have underlined in public statements their support for a ceasefire in Gaza, Gov. Shapiro has failed to do that,"" the statement read. ""His attacks on academic freedom, intentionally depicting protests in a negative light, failure to care for and listen to Palestinian Pennsylvanians whose families are being massacred day in and out by Israeli government, and his behind-the-scenes antagonization of community organizations cannot be ignored and easily forgiven,"" it continued. Yemen's government and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have agreed to halt tit-for-tat banking sanctions as they wrestle for control of the country's financial institutions, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The Houthis have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since March 2015, months after they seized the capital Sanaa and most of Yemen's population centres, forcing the internationally recognised government south to Aden. The rebels and the government had in December committed to a UN-led roadmap to end the war, agreeing to work towards ""the resumption of an inclusive political process."" But Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping since November and subsequent US and British retaliation have put peace talks on hold. On Monday, the two sides informed Hans Grundberg, the UN envoy to Yemen, that they ""agreed on several measures to de-escalate"", said a statement from Grundberg's office, which thanked Saudi Arabia for its ""significant role"" in brokering the deal. It came as the warring parties were locked in a fight for control over the country's banks, with both facing a severe financial crunch. Their latest agreement involves ""cancelling all the recent decisions and procedures against banks by both sides and refraining in the future from any similar decisions or procedures,"" the envoy's office said. In May, the government-controlled central bank banned transactions with six banks in Houthi-held Sanaa for failing to abide by an order to relocate to Aden. The rebels, who run their own central bank and use different bank notes with different exchange rates, said the move was a disguised attempt by the United States and Saudi Arabia to exert financial pressure on the Houthi banking system. The Houthis retaliated by banning any dealings with 13 banks in Aden, which means those in rebel-held areas could no longer receive remittances through them or withdraw and deposit funds. After striking their latest agreement, the warring parties will convene ""meetings to discuss all economic and humanitarian issues based on the (UN) roadmap,"" said Grundberg's office. It stressed ""the need for the parties to collaborate towards an economy that benefits all Yemenis and supports the implementation of a nationwide ceasefire and the resumption of an inclusive political process."" The statement said the warring parties have also agreed to settle disputes over Yemenia, the country's national airline, which has accused the Houthis of freezing its funds held in Sanaa banks. Yemenia flights will resume between Sanaa and Jordan, and the number of trips will be raised to three daily, according to the deal. Yemenia will also operate flights to Cairo and India ""daily or as needed,"" the statement said."
