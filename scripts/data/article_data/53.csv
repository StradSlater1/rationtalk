His lone setback was a knockout loss to Charles Johnson 11 months ago, but Van has since racked up four consecutive wins — three straight three-round decisions over Edgar Charez, Cody Durden and Rei Tsuruya plus his stoppage of Silva.', 'Stylistically speaking, Royval vs. Van is one of the most fan-friendly matchups the UFC could put together in the 125-pound division — in any division, for that matter.', 'After only eight Octagon appearances, Van is already tied with Pantoja for the third-most significant strikes landed in UFC flyweight history. His and the current champion’s 893 significant strikes landed are behind only flyweight legend Demetrious Johnson’s 1,059 and Moreno’s record 1,220.', 'Van’s 8.2 strikes landed per minute ranks first among all active UFC fighters regardless of weight class.
