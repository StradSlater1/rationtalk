Report: New York to ask Dallas for permission to talk to Jason Kidd about becoming head coach,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/report-new-york-to-ask-dallas-for-permission-to-talk-to-jason-kidd-about-becoming-head-coach,"['The New York Knicks — searching for a new coach after the firing of Tom Thibodeau, who led them to the Eastern Conference Finals — are expected to ask permission of the Dallas Mavericks to talk to Jason Kidd about coming to Manhattan, reports Marc Stein of The Stein Line in his latest Substack missive.', '“The New York Knicks are expected to formally request permission to speak to the Dallas Mavericks’ Jason Kidd about their coaching vacancy in coming days, league sources say... A precise hierarchy of potential Knicks targets to replace Thibodeau has yet to emerge, but some in league coaching circles believe that Kidd... is at the top of New York’s wish list.”', 'Kidd coached Brunson for a year in Dallas, and the two had a good relationship (Brunson’s issues in Dallas were about his next contract and feeling lowballed and disrespected, not the coaching).', 'Two big questions emerge here. First, would Dallas give permission for New York to talk to Kidd? Mavs ownership/management can say no, which is reportedly what Houston would do if New York called about Ime Udoka (Stein wrote that the Knicks would like Udoka, but knows they would be turned down if they asked). As a standard practice, if the coach is open to it, teams will let their coach have those conversations with another team, but if things get serious and the coach wants to move on then draft compensation has to come back to the coach’s current team (and the Knicks are not flush with draft picks to send to Dallas). Kidd signed an extension with Dallas that runs through 2027 and by all accounts is happy there, Stein reports.', 'Second, would Kidd want the job? ESPN’s Tim MacMahon said on the outlet’s “Hoop Collective” podcast that Kidd’s “ears would perk up” at the idea, adding that the Knicks need to bring in a “relationship guy” and Kidd fits that bill.', '“Listen, one of the names that’s been thrown out there is a man who’s under contract with another team, but definitely a guy who has relationships not just with Jalen Brunson but with a lot of people in that organization, and that’s Jason Kidd. And what I will say about that is I would not dismiss that possibility.”', 'Kidd was hired to be the Mavericks’ coach by former owner Mark Cuban. In the wake of the ownership change and the Luka Doncic trade, would he want out? Dallas still has talent on the roster, including Kyrie Irving (out for most or all of next season with a torn ACL), Anthony Davis, and incoming No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg, as well as solid players such as P.J. Washington, Naji Marshall, and others.', 'If the Knicks can’t get Kidd or Udoka, where do they turn next? They reportedly want an experienced head coach, which would rule out former assistant Johnnie Bryant (who is now in Cleveland and was a finalist for the Suns job). Michael Malone is out there, but he is seen as similar to Thibodeau in leaning too heavily into his starters and being set in his ways. Former Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins is available. Former Cavaliers, Lakers and most recently Kings coach Mike Brown is available, he is a defense-first guy, but is he an upgrade over Thibodeau that takes them to the next level?', 'The Knicks moved on from Thibodeau without a replacement lined up, which could make this search messy.', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Knicks Expected To Request Permission To Talk To Mavs’ Kidd,https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2025/06/knicks-expected-to-request-permission-to-talk-to-mavs-kidd.html,"['Hoops Rumors', 'The Knicks, who have a newly created head coaching vacancy after parting ways with Tom Thibodeau earlier this week, are expected to ask the Mavericks for permission to speak to Dallas head coach Jason Kidd, reports Marc Stein of The Stein Line (Substack link).', 'Stein, who identified Kidd on Wednesday as a potential target for the Knicks, says sources have described New York’s interest in the Mavs coach as “serious,” adding that some people in coaching circles believe he’s the Knicks’ top target to replace Thibodeau.', 'The Knicks were also said to be interested in Rockets head coach Ime Udoka, but multiple reporters – including Stein – have stated that Houston has no interest in granting New York permission to speak to Udoka. Stein hasn’t been able to confirm if the Mavs would take a similar position with Kidd.', 'Kidd was initially hired by former Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in 2021, a little before Nico Harrison came aboard as the team’s head of basketball operations. Given that Cuban is no longer running the show in Dallas and Harrison didn’t hire Kidd himself, it’s possible the Mavs wouldn’t be as attached to him as the Rockets are to Udoka.', 'Kidd signed a contract extension with the Mavericks in May of 2024. According to Stein, that deal tacked on two years to Kidd’s previous contract, which would’ve expired at the end of 2024/25.', 'In the past, there have been instances where a team gave up draft compensation in order to hire a head coach away from another franchise — in fact, as Stein notes, that has happened before with Kidd, as the Bucks sent a pair of second-rounders to hire him away from the Nets in 2014. It remains to be seen whether the Knicks would be willing to take a similar route to hire Kidd.', 'Although Kidd has spoken about how he wasn’t involved in the unpopular decision to trade Luka Doncic in February, he’s believed to still be happy in Dallas and is excited about the opportunity to coach Cooper Flagg, according to Stein. Kidd also has strong relationships with current Mavs stars Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis.', 'Even if Kidd ends up staying put, the Mavs’ coaching staff seems likely to undergo some changes this offseason. Assistants Sean Sweeney and Jared Dudley both received consideration in Phoenix’s coaching search, according to Stein, who reports that the Spurs have expressed interest in trying to hire Sweeney as an assistant, while the Grizzlies recently spoke to Dudley about a role on their staff. Both San Antonio (Mitch Johnson) and Memphis (Tuomas Iisalo) have first-time head coaches who were promoted during the 2024/25 season and will be entering their first full seasons as head coaches in ’25/26.', 'The Mavs already lost one key assistant – Alex Jensen – earlier this year, when he agreed to become the new head coach at the University of Utah.

NBA Insider Reveals Nico Harrison’s Shocking Decision Could Force Jason Kidd To Leave Mavericks,https://www.profootballnetwork.com/nba/nico-harrison-decision-force-jason-kidd-to-leave-mavericks/,"['The Dallas Mavericks and Nico Harrison shocked the world after trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Dallas franchise received big man Anthony Davis in return when a three-team trade took place, including the Utah Jazz.', 'Mavericks fans torched Harrison for the decision to let a superstar like Dončić leave just one season after their appearance at the 2024 NBA Finals. Harrison tried to justify the decision when he claimed that solving the franchise’s glaring need for defense would give them a shot at the championship. But even this didn’t stop the backlash against the GM.', ""Dive into PFSN's FREE NBA Mock Draft Simulator and take the place of any of the 30 GMs around the league."", 'Jason Kidd, the Mavericks’ head coach, wasn’t even aware of the trade until insider Shams Charania broke the news one hour later. It certainly looks like Harrison kept Kidd in the dark, and this decision adds to his long list of questionable actions by the Mavericks’ GM.', 'NBA insider Tim McMahon claims that these decisions could force the franchise to pay a hefty price, so much so that even Kidd might leave.', 'During a recent appearance on The Hoop Collective, McMahon revealed that Kidd wasn’t on board with some of the Mavericks’ decisions. He said, “I’m not going to sit here and tell you that I know or even think that J-Kidd wants out of Dallas, that would be going way too far.”', '“What I can comfortably say is there’s certainly have been decisions, major franchise decisions that have been made that he was not on board with, one of which includes the firing of [former head athletic trainer] Casey Smith, who J-Kidd has been extremely tight with since his second tenure as a player in Dallas, who is now running the health and performance group for the New York Knicks,” McMahon added.', 'He also revealed that Kidd is content with the current team, including the likes of Davis and Kyrie Irving. But the firing of head athletic trainer Casey Smith didn’t sit too well with Kidd. Smith is now with the Knicks, who are currently without a head coach after firing Tom Thibodeau.', 'McMahon emphasized the fact that it would be extreme to claim that Kidd wants out of Dallas, but it is certain that he, along with Dirk Nowitzki, didn’t like how Smith was treated.', 'Smith was a close friend of the Mavericks legend, and his forced departure pushed Nowitzki away from the franchise. The alleged treatment of Smith and other former Mavericks employees was revealed by an ESPN report in April by none other than McMahon.', 'An anonymous source revealed that Harrison felt “threatened” by Smith, and his intention was to show who was in charge, as revealed by McMahon.', 'The long list of Harrison’s controversial decisions seems to be damaging the franchise’s reputation further, and it would be interesting to see if they can cause Kidd to look elsewhere, like McMahon suggests.', 'Harrison is a saboteur in our organization. I don’t know why, but his recent actions prove just that. I do think motives will be known further down the road, but for now, read the signs and beware!!! Stop the bleeding before it is to late!! He don’t fit in to the generation of hard work and honorable behavior by great players that have brought the success and t h e respect that our franchise deserves and we the Fans love so dearly!! All that behind the back borderline illegal behavior that Nico brings is not good for our Team or the League!!! I personally wish he would step down and go away!!!

If the Knicks still harbor dreams of landing Antetokounmpo, Kidd’s presence wouldn’t hurt.', 'Kidd also has credibility in the building. He played his final NBA season at Madison Square Garden, starting 48 games for the last Knicks team to win 50 games before Thibodeau’s arrival. He’s a Hall of Fame point guard, a 10-time All-Star, and the floor general of the 2011 championship Mavericks.

"The Knicks are expected to ask Dallas for permission to speak to Jason Kidd, per Marc Stein",https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2025/6/6/24444428/the-knicks-are-expected-to-ask-dallas-for-permission-to-speak-to-jason-kidd-per-marc-stein,"['FILED UNDER:', 'A move from Dallas to New York is not unfamiliar to the Mavericks’ head coach', 'Marc Stein reported Friday morning that, after rumors of the Knicks’ interest in Jason Kidd circulated this week, they plan to formally ask the Mavericks to speak to him about becoming their next head coach. If this were to happen, the likely route would be via trade. Not only would this be the second time Kidd would leave Dallas for New York, but it would also be the second time Kidd would be traded as a coach. As Stein noted, the Mavericks could shoot down an attempt to speak with Kidd, but the intent to do so has not been made public, despite Stein reaching out to confirm this week.', 'Selfishly, I would love to see Kidd go tell the New York media nobody is dying after a February loss to the Wizards. There is a stench from the Luka Doncic fiasco that still smells ripe on all of the coaching staff and the front office. One way or another, that must be extinguished. I am not particularly interested in winning next season like Nico Harrison or Patrick Dumont are, and I feel indifferent about Kidd’s potential successor. I want to be able to remove the asterisk when I say I am rooting for the Dallas Mavericks, and Kidd going to New York would help do that.', 'In reality, the logistics of this move make it very difficult. New York would have to be so in love with Kidd that they would be willing to give up the limited draft picks they have to trade for him. Conversely, Kidd would have to be so fed up with the situation in Dallas, which includes the potential of coaching Cooper Flagg, that he forces the Mavericks’ hand to let him go. Jalen Brunson’s relationship with Kidd, which Stein commented on, could be a factor in getting this done. Kidd unlocked Brunson three years ago and got him paid by the Knicks. The prospect of coaching a title-contending team with your old protégé may be too good to pass up. For now, however, Kidd remains the coach of the Dallas Mavericks. Whether or not the organization allows him to speak with New York over the coming days and weeks will be very telling of how Kidd and the Mavericks feel about his current position.', 'Gambling Problem?

He just wrapped up his second season with the Rockets, which resulted in a 52-30 record. Although the Rockets went into the playoffs as the second seed, they ended up coming up short in the first round.', 'Is Houston’s inexperience enough to help the Knicks lure Udoka out of the Western Conference? So far, there hasn’t been any indication that Udoka is willing to make his way back to the Atlantic Conference. Still, as the Knicks are early in the process of finding a new head coach, they seem to be going for an unrealistic set of targets, which includes Jason Kidd, Udoka, and the retired Jay Wright.', 'Udoka, a former player-turned-coach, is a product of the Gregg Popovich tree out in San Antonio. After coaching with the Spurs from 2012 to 2019, Udoka joined the 76ers in Philadelphia. He was a top assistant with Brett Brown.', 'After one season with the Sixers, Udoka parted ways with the organization, joining the Brooklyn Nets for one season. Udoka spent one season under Steve Nash before getting hired by the Boston Celtics as the head coach. A violation of team policies in 2022 led Udoka to face a year-long suspension.

And now, with the New York Knicks head coaching job unexpectedly open, a slow, quiet pivot might already be underway.', 'He won’t say it out loud. Neither will the Mavericks. But this isn’t just smoke. This is a well-timed opportunity. And Kidd knows it.', 'Let’s rewind.', 'When he took over as head coach in 2021, Jason Kidd shocked the NBA world by guiding Luka Dončić and a ragtag cast of overachievers past the number one seed Phoenix Suns in a Game 7 demolition on Phoenix’s home floor. Then he steered that team into the Western Conference Finals — only to lose, expectedly, to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors.', 'The following year? Disaster. The Mavericks attempted to address their size issues with JaVale McGee and Christian Wood, and it imploded. Only a tank-job at the end of the season saved their pick — the one that became Dereck Lively II. Kyrie Irving arrived via midseason trade, and the vibes stabilized just enough to keep hope alive.', 'Then came 2023–2024. Kyrie and Luka clicked. The team gelled. And they marched to the NBA Finals.', 'That should’ve been the story. A flawed team finding magic. A coach proving he could evolve. A duo ready to run it back in 2024–2025.', 'Instead? Luka Dončić was traded. Nico Harrison’s obsession with names from his Nike Rolodex led him to ship out a generational superstar for a crumbling Anthony Davis. It broke the fanbase, fractured trust, and left Kidd to manage a team built on two timelines: the brittle now (Davis and Kyrie) and the potential future (whatever hope the draft could bring).', 'Then the Mavericks got lucky.', 'With just 1.8% odds, they landed the No. 1 pick. The clear path to Cooper Flagg. A new era dropped into their lap.', 'And that’s when the clock on Kidd’s tenure may have truly started ticking.', 'Because you can’t ride two horses with one saddle. You can’t build around a teenager while pretending Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving will give you 65+ healthy games apiece. Not in this league. Not in this economy.', 'If the Mavericks draft Flagg, they’re choosing a timeline. And even if they keep Davis and Kyrie for now, the long-term is clearly headed somewhere younger. Somewhere slower. Somewhere not built for Jason Kidd’s legacy aspirations.', 'The Knicks offer something Dallas can’t: a clean slate and a hungry veteran roster who must feel like they let a golden chance slip through their fingers with their upset loss to the Indiana Pacers in the Conference Finals. Now here they sit for Kidd — a big market. A shot at rewriting the final act. A team needing a players’ coach veterans are less likely to tune out like they did with Tom Thibodeau.', 'And Kidd knows New York. He chose them in free agency after the 2011 title. He has ties, relationships. A narrative.', 'If he leaves now, he avoids the guillotine that may fall on Nico Harrison midseason. He sidesteps having to explain nightly why Cooper Flagg is playing through rookie mistakes while Davis sits in street clothes and Kyrie rehabs an ACL. He exits on his own terms.', 'And if he goes? Kyrie might go, too. He has an opt-out. And without Kidd, the trust and chemistry they built might dissolve. If Kyrie walks, Davis becomes a trade candidate almost immediately. And if that happens, so does Nico.', 'So yes, this is about Jason Kidd. But it’s also about how everything unravels. The first domino that leads to a new era of Dallas Mavericks basketball — leaving behind both the great memories of unexpected highs and the deep wounds of unforgivable blunders. Well, the wounds will remain, but at least the architect and his dutiful coach would be elsewhere.', 'Jason Kidd might not be the villain of the story.

That number has come with three different franchises. Kidd began his head-coaching career with the Brooklyn Nets before eventually joining the Milwaukee Bucks.

Knicks will reportedly ask Mavericks for permission to interview Jason Kidd to replace Tom Thibodeau,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/knicks-will-reportedly-ask-mavericks-for-permission-to-interview-jason-kidd-to-replace-tom-thibodeau/,"['', ""The New York Knicks made the somewhat surprising move to fire coach Tom Thibodeau after losing in the Eastern Conference Finals. It's not often that a front office goes ahead and fires a coach who makes the conference finals -- especially for a team that hasn't made it there in more than two decades. "", ""However, the Knicks felt this was a team with a higher ceiling than an ECF exit and that Thibodeau had not maximized this roster. In firing him, the Knicks made clear that anything short of a title is going to be a failure, setting extremely high expectations on the next coach to take over. Two coaches quickly moved to the top of the Knicks' public wish list. The Rockets' Ime Udoka and Mavericks' Jason Kidd are reportedly highly coveted by the Knicks, but they would need permission to interview. By all accounts, Houston will not allow New York to speak with Udoka, but no confirmation regarding Kidd is available. "", 'Marc Stein, who has deep ties in Dallas, reported Friday that  the Knicks plan to make a formal request to interview Kidd ""in the coming days."" ', ""That would be a considerable step forward in the Knicks' coaching search and given the Mavs are headed in a new direction suddenly, they might be willing to move on from Kidd. The previous Mavs regime hired Kidd specifically with coaching Luka Dončić in mind, but Dončić is now gone, a new leadership group is in charge and with the Mavs landing the No. 1 pick (and thus, Cooper Flagg) in the draft lottery, the three-year title window they proposed when they traded for Anthony Davis has now widened considerably. "", 'Kidd probably sees the Knicks as being closer to a title than Dallas, especially with Kyrie Irving missing much of next season, and the Mavs might be willing to let him go to the East. If the that ends up being the case, it would be the second time Kidd has been traded as a coach, as the Bucks sent second round picks to Brooklyn in 2014 to bring Kidd in after his first season as a coach. ', ""If the Mavs say no, the Knicks are expected to keep attention on established former head coaches, rather than exploring the assistant market. We'll have to see if that excludes Johnnie Bryant, the hottest assistant on the coaching market, but all signs point to New York looking at the likes of Taylor Jenkins, Michael Malone, Mike Brown, Frank Vogel and Mike Budenholzer, all of whom have extensive experience and were recently fired, with three of them -- Malone, Vogel and Budenholzer -- winning championships in the past.

', '“The Knicks have yet to request permission to speak to Kidd, who has two years remaining on the contract extension he signed during the Mavs’ 2024 run to the NBA Finals, sources said,” Charania and MacMahon wrote. “Dallas general manager Nico Harrison and governor Patrick Dumont have not yet discussed whether the franchise would be willing to grant permission for Kidd to speak to the Knicks, sources said.”', 'Kidd has coached the Brooklyn Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and Mavericks, compiling a record of 362-339 in the regular season and 31-33 in the playoffs.

And that’s Jason Kidd. And what I will say about that is, I would not dismiss that possibility.”', 'The Knicks made the conference finals this year for the first time since 2000. They lost to the Indiana Pacers in six games. ', 'This article first appeared on Hoops Wire and was syndicated with permission.', 'More must-reads:', ""The Celtics are going to be shedding salary this summer. That is clearly their top goal this offseason with Jayson Tatum getting ready to miss most of his season next year with a torn Achilles. Jrue Holiday is one of the players that the Celtics are likely going to trade away in order to meet that goal. With his age and over $104 million left on his deal, the Celtics are going to try to find a partner to deal him to. Even though he is getting towards the end of his career, there are a few teams out there that will be interested in bringing him in for a deep playoff run. The Boston Celtics should look to trade Jrue Holiday to the Dallas Mavericks Perhaps the perfect team for Holiday to head to would be the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas has made it abundantly clear that they are trying to win a title in the next couple of seasons. Kyrie Irving will miss a good chunk of the season with a torn ACL. Bringing Holiday in would give them a win-now point guard who can play solid defense while Irving heals his knee. Anthony Davis is still the best player on their team, but adding Holiday gives them a shot to be a playoff contender next season. They can't waste another season of Davis' prime. The Celtics could be interested in a package that includes Daniel Gafford, Max Christie, and a pick for Holiday. That would help them continue to be relevant while Tatum recovers. More Celtics news: Bold Trade Proposal Has Celtics Move All-Star in Head-Scratching Salary Dump Boston is looking to still be a good team over the next couple of years. They are not looking for a straight salary dump with nothing in return for Holiday. Trading with another team that thinks they can win now would give them the best chance to get someone good in return for Holiday. Dallas is a team that would have interest in him that can provide that. This season, Holiday averaged 11.1 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game.

Spending the first seven years of his career with the Washington Nationals, Harper is now in his seventh season with the Phillies. Originally an outfielder, Harper has made the transition to first base, playing the position primarily for the last few seasons. While his numbers are a bit down this season, Harper still rates as one of the best offensive players in the National League. Entering Friday, the left-handed slugger owns an .814 OPS with nine home runs. As the Phillies begin a series with the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday, Harper was notably absent from the starting lineup. Batting third and playing first base in Philadelphia\'s 9-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday, Harper went 0-for-4. Amid Harper\'s absence from Friday\'s lineup, Phillies manager Rob Thomson announced an update. ""Bryce Harper is out tonight due to a lingering wrist issue that he’s been playing through for awhile, per Rob Thomson,"" Paul Casella of MLB wrote on X. ""Went to the trainers today and said it was bothering him a bit more. Thomson believes it’s a day-to-day situation."" Any right wrist/hand issues will be especially troubling for a left-handed hitter like Harper. Also a right-handed thrower, Harper\'s defense could be impacted by this issue as well. Fortunately it seems as if this ailment is not expected to sideline Harper longterm, as Thomson announced the current timetable is day-to-day.', 'If the Toronto Maple Leafs lose Mitch Marner, either through free agency or by trading his rights this summer, the team will need to seek a replacement option. Some believe the Leafs will not focus on one player but try to change the “DNA” of the roster by targeting a different mix. Having said that, some fairly prominent names are popping up in the rumor mill that may intrigue Toronto. Jason Robertson could be on the market The crew from Daily Faceoff recently noted that the Dallas Stars might be looking for more change beyond just firing their coach Peter DeBoer, which they did on Friday. Frank Seravalli noted, “I think everyone thinks there’s going to be some kind of change. Jason Robertson’s name was floating out there …” He added, “So a lot is happening in Big D after the Oilers knocked them out in the Western Conference Final for the second year in a row.” There is a belief that the Stars want to make some adjustments, while also freeing up cap space (they only have $5M). If they prioritize keeping Mikael Granlund or chasing someone like Aaron Ekblad, they need to move money. The Leafs could land Robertson, who is an elite scorer and would join his brother Nick Robertson, potentially elevating his game. Robertson is a left-winger who shoots left. That said, the Maple Leafs can use a top-line left-winger, and it just changes what side that point production comes from. Martin Necas isn’t happy in Colorado Sportsnet’s Nick Kypreos is reporting that Martin Necas “wasn’t overly thrilled” with his experience in Colorado and wants to explore other options. Considering he just joined the team and had a relatively strong run, it’s a blow for the Avalanche if true. However, that loss could be Toronto’s gain. Signed for one more season after this one, if it’s clear he’s going to test free agency, the Avs will be looking to move him and trying to get what they can before getting nothing becomes a potential reality. Necas will produce, and the Leafs might be willing to give him a hefty raise while still saving big money over what they would have paid Marner on an extension. There will be other options as the NHL Draft nears and teams start thinking about changes. These are just two players, but others will pop up. Who should the Leafs look at if the options in free agency are slim and teams explore trade options?', 'The Boston Bruins are reportedly monitoring Aaron Ekblad’s contract situation in Florida as free agency nears, with the veteran defenseman possibly hitting the open market. Boston looking to upgrade defense during critical offseason The Boston Bruins are expected to be active this summer as they retool their roster. With the blue line in focus, one high-end name starting to emerge is Aaron Ekblad of the Florida Panthers. While Ekblad is currently in the middle of a Stanley Cup Final rematch against the Edmonton Oilers, uncertainty around his future is beginning to grow. Ekblad says he wants to stay, but Panthers face tough cap decisions Ekblad, 28, didn’t hesitate when asked about his future with the only NHL team he’s ever played for. The former first-overall pick made it clear where his heart still lies. I live and breathe for the Florida Panthers. I bleed for the Florida Panthers. I’ve given my body and everything to this team. I want to keep doing it forever, for as long as they’ll let me keep coming to the rink. He’s spent 11 seasons in Florida and has become one of the team’s foundational leaders. But with his $7.5 million AAV contract expiring at the end of June, and the Panthers facing cap constraints, the front office has difficult decisions to make. Florida juggling multiple expiring deals under $19M cap space The Panthers are projected to have around $19 million in available cap space this offseason. However, several key players are approaching the end of their deals, making it unlikely that Florida can retain everyone, especially at a premium cost. That reality has opened the door to speculation. If Ekblad hits free agency, it would be the first time in his career. And while his preference is clear, this may come down to math more than emotion. Bruins could be well-positioned if Ekblad becomes available Boston’s need on defense is no secret. With questions around depth and long-term stability on the blue line, a player like Ekblad, steady, physical, and playoff-tested, would be a major addition. It remains to be seen how aggressive Bruins GM Don Sweeney will be on the open market, but if Ekblad becomes available, the interest will likely be mutual. Boston can offer opportunity, structure, and the chance to stay competitive in the East. For now, everything hinges on how the Panthers approach their offseason once the Final wraps. But if Florida is forced to let go, expect the Bruins to be one of the first teams at the table.', 'Get the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily.
