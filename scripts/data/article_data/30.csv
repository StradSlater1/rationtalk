"Apple WWDC 2025 keynote recap: New iOS 26, Liquid Glass look coming to devices",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-2025-keynote-live-updates/84087256007/,"['At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, June 9, Apple introduced new feature-rich operating systems sporting a sexy Liquid Glass makeover.', ""And, as expected, the new super-smart artificial intelligence-powered Siri was a no-show. But the feature, which debuted at last year's WWDC, had a hinted return appearance coming later this year."", 'Still, Apple Intelligence had a major part to play, with AI shown to power a new live translation feature that automatically translates messages, generates translated captions on Facetime and audio translations on phone calls. Visual intelligence upgrades coming to the new operating system, dubbed iOS 26, were shown using ChatGPT to learn about on-screen objects, whether to buy or gain knowledge.', ""Here's what was announced at Apple's WWDC keynote, which included an address from CEO Tim Cook."", 'iOS 26 will be released for testing June 9 through the Apple Developer Program and a public beta version will be released through the Apple Beta Software Program next month, CEO Tim Cook said at the close of the keynote presentation.', 'The operating system will be available as an update for iPhone 11 and later ""this fall,"" he said.', 'Software boss Craig Federighi cited examples of new features such as Live Translation and Visual Intelligence as advances Apple was making with its Apple Intelligence. “Our platforms are more powerful and more useful than ever. We’re continuing to integrate Apple Intelligence across our ecosystem with so many new features that are right where you need them in the apps you use every day.', 'Cook added, ""We continue to advance each of our platforms with more ways to harness the power of Apple Intelligence, as well as a beautiful new design, our product experiences become even more seamless and enjoyable.""', 'Apple stock fell more than 1% as the WWDC event played out. Shares opened Monday, June 9, at $204.39, but fell to below $202 during the event.', 'The company stock price hit $259 in late December 2024, near the end of a three-month period in which Apple set an all-time record for iPhone upgrades. But shares dipped to $172 in April 2025 a few weeks after the company announced it was delaying some artificial intelligence upgrades to Siri to 2026.', 'Apple showed off its iPad ""windowing"" system in iPadOS 26, which mimics a computer more than an iPhone. Users can open and arrange multiple apps at once using customizable sizing options.', 'The upcoming MacOS will be called Tahoe, with a new design incorporating Liquid Glass so the dock and widgets look more refined. Your display will look larger and there are more ways to customize and personalize your Mac to match your style, Federighi said. Nice touches include adding emojis to folders, for instance.', ""On-screen menu options you'll see while watching Apple TV+ productions are getting a makeover in the style of Liquid Glass, while the titles of TV shows and movie options on the home page are getting a bolder look as well."", 'Visual Intelligence will be part of iOS 26 and let users explore their surroundings without changing apps. You use your camera “to learn about the objects and places around you,” Federighi said.', 'It will also let you use any app to learn more about what you are seeing. For instance, say you have a social media app up and see an instrument, you can screenshot that and ask ChatGPT “which rock songs is this instrument featured in,” and it lists songs for you, as demonstrated by the Apple design team’s Billy Sorrentino.', 'Also, if you see a piece of clothing or a lamp that interests you, with a screenshot an option will pop up to search for similar items in other apps such as Etsy. Visual Intelligence will also let you add an event you see in another app directly to your calendar.', 'Other iPhone updates include polls in Messages, while Spam Detection will slot unknown message senders into a separate queue until you approve them. ', 'The upcoming iOS 26 will have a new unified phone layout that combines Favorites, Recents and Voicemails, so you don’t have to switch views. AI will create voicemail summaries. “This new intuitive layout makes it easier to navigate the app,” said Darin Adler, vice president of internet technologies.', 'A Call Screening feature will answer unknown callers in the background and once they leave a voicemail is left you can pick up or ignore the message.', 'Another new feature, Hold Assist will “keep your spot in line while you wait for a live agent,” Adler said. Hold Assist automatically detects hold music and lets you tap hold and you can keep using your iPhone. Hold Assist will ring back to you when to return to the call.', 'The new iPhone software will be called iOS 26, Federighi says. That comes after Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface design, showed how the new operating systems will have an interface featuring “Liquid Glass,” which is translucent like glass but with a fluidity. Liquid Glass “brings more clarity to navigation and controls,” he said.', 'Using the camera, you swipe and tap to make the menu options appear using the new Liquid Glass interface, Federighi said. When using Safari, you get a larger screen with the dynamic controls hidden until you tap.', 'The event begins with video showing Apple CEO Tim Cook talking with Federighi who is driving an F1 car around the top of Apple Park, a nod to the new Apple TV+ film, “F1,” starring Brad Pitt, hitting theaters June 27. “So glad they put CarPlay in this beast,” Federighi says, and blasts the song “Round and Round,” by by rock band Ratt.', 'You can watch the WWDC keynote beginning at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT. on Apple TV, on apple.com and on the Apple YouTube page.', ""Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, held June 9-13, is the tech giant's annual showcase of its upcoming software updates. That means new features coming to iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and other devices."", 'Apple CEO Tim Cook typically delivers the keynote. Software boss Craig Federighi will likely also take the stage.', 'During Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 10, 2024, the company revealed features in iOS 18 and other operating systems including iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence and a smarter Siri virtual assistant.', ""No. Usually iPhones and devices such as iPads typically are debuted at Apple's September event. Last year, the company unveiled iPhone 16 models, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4."", ""Apple is expected to demonstrate new operating systems for iPhone, iPad and other devices including Mac computers, Apple Watch and Apple TV. What would be iOS 19 is expected to become iOS 26 – with a numerical name change similar to how car models are based on years, several outlets including Bloomberg and MacRumors have reported, citing unnamed persons familiar with Apple's plans."", 'Also, there may not be a big artificial intelligence splash. At last year\'s WWDC, Apple introduced a more ""personal"" and smarter Siri virtual assistant, which used Apple Intelligence, but many of the planned improvements have been delayed until 2026.', ""However, Apple is expected to announce that third-party developers will be able to begin using the same AI foundation models the company uses for its Apple Intelligence platform, a move allowing developers to create new applications for Apple devices, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported."", 'Among the features Apple is expected to unfold at the event is an AI-powered iPhone battery management mode, which will monitor how you use your phone to conserve energy, Bloomberg has reported. Also possibly to be shown: a new game center app, Bloomberg reported.', 'iOS 26 will be the next operating system for the iPhone, according to multiple reports. Other operating systems for Apple devices include MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, tvOS, visionOS. The MacOs is expected to named ""Tahoe,"" the latest in a long line of names based on California locales, Bloomberg\'s Gurman reported.', 'The operating systems will have a new look in addition to new naming scheme. The new interfaces will use light and transparency, Bloomberg reported, styled similarly to the visionOS used on the Vision Pro headset, unveiled at the WWDC two years ago. App icons, tool bars and tab bars are set to look different in the update.', 'With the ""26 update,"" Apple is ""changing the playbook. They\'re not just going (to) iOS 19,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told USA TODAY. ""I think this is also a much bigger OS update, because it all sets up for iPhone 17 and the true AI strategy coming to Cupertino.', ""Apple may not reveal a truly Apple-Intelligent Siri – allowing the digital assistant to handle tasks across various apps via voice commands – but the company will show off new Apple Intelligence-driven features through its operating systems, Ives said. He expects more information on the company's AI plans including Gemini and ChatGPT integration with Siri and other apps."", '""It\'s really going to unleash developers to take Apple into this next generation,"" Ives said. ""They need to build iOS that you could have true AI apps deployed in the ecosystem. Remember 25% of the world is going to access an AI through an Apple device over the coming years. ... They\'re going to have to make sure they\'re a key player in AI with the other big tech players in this Game of Thrones battle.""', 'Observers will want to see progress. ""Patience might be the word of the day, or even the year for Apple. People are talking about this as an AI gap year for Apple,” Alex Kantrowitz, founder of Big Technology podcast and newsletter, said on CNBC on Monday, June 9. ""They had the big vision announcement last year. Not a lot of progress this year as they tried to build it. It is hard to build.”', ""Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is underway.

WWDC’s best announcement was something Windows did 15 years ago—here's why it's awesome,https://www.techradar.com/computing/wwdcs-best-announcement-was-something-windows-did-15-years-ago-heres-why-its-awesome,"['Through the looking glass', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'I might spend most of my time writing about Apple – I was following along with the WWDC show today, in fact – but my first computing experiences were of a decidedly Windows flavor. In fact, I’ve used Windows since Windows 95, but the first edition that I truly fell in love with was Windows 7.', 'But it wasn’t any of the new features or functionality that captured my attention at the time – it was the design. Windows 7 took Microsoft’s operating system from a staid, grey platform that could give itself boredom into one that was modern, sleek and classy, all in a single OS update.', 'The key element in this was Aero, Windows 7’s glass-like transparency effect. With this in place, colors subtly refracted through windows and title bars, and it all shimmered and shone in real time as you dragged your apps around your screen. For my design-obsessed young brain, it was a graphical marvel.', 'It was, to borrow a phrase from Steve Jobs, so good you wanted to lick it.', 'Naturally, I was devastated when Microsoft did away with this design, and I still don’t think the company has been able to match it in the decade and a half since.', 'Yet watching Apple unveil its new Liquid Glass design language during the company’s WWDC keynote today, I felt a sudden jolt of nostalgia. Here was a glassy, translucent interface that used light and colour to create gorgeous effects on your desktop. It was everything I loved from those halcyon Windows 7 days, back with new twists for a new era.', 'Who would have thought that Apple would bring back a Microsoft design with such aplomb?', '', 'Of course, Liquid Glass is likely to provide plenty of fuel for those critics who allege that all Apple does is copy other people’s work. Yet not only does Liquid Glass show what a braindead take this is, it also highlights exactly the kind of thinking that goes into all of Apple’s designs – and showcase a key difference between its mindset and that of Microsoft.', 'Because as much as I absolutely adored Windows 7’s look and feel, Aero was essentially a cosmetic coat of paint. It was about looking great – and sure, it sumptuously smashed it in that department – but it didn’t go much beyond that.', 'Liquid Glass, on the other hand, is about form and function. It’s not just a pretty face (although it is that too in spades) but offers much more on closer inspection.', 'For instance, Apple made a point of showing the responsiveness of its new interface. Swipe up or down and your iPhone’s floating menu panels automatically adjust their size. Resizing something will prompt it to flex with your mouse or finger. It’s all designed to impact the way you use your device, not just how you look at it.', '', 'This hits a core principle that has driven Apple since the days of Steve Jobs: “design is how it works.” Many people think that “design” just means making something pretty, and that’s all there is to it. But design should never exist just to serve itself – it must serve the user, and that means you have to create something that works amazingly well. Design is what makes that happen.', 'Steve Jobs summed it up when he launched the original iMac. In response to Microsoft’s Bill Gates claiming Apple had merely put a new lick of paint on its old devices, Jobs shot back: “The thing that our competitors are missing is that they think it’s about fashion, and they think it’s about surface appearance. They say, ‘We’ll slap a little color on this piece of junk computer, and we’ll have one too’.”', 'In other words, you can’t put lipstick on a pig. Dress up an awful device and you still have an awful device underneath. Something must work brilliantly and look great in order to be designed well.', 'This idea is what makes me so excited about Liquid Glass. Not only is it a revival of the elegant transparency effects of Windows 7’s Aero, but it actually adds extra functionality. It gives you new ways to use your Mac or your iPhone, and it looks stunning while doing it.', 'Design is how it works. Liquid Glass just proved it.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', ""Alex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

Still, Puckett is optimistic, based on Apple’s past accessibility features, that readability will improve over time.', 'Controls and navigation transform as you interact with the user interface.', 'Serhii Popov, a design-first software engineer at MacPaw, the company behind the CleanMyMac app, is curious to see how the new operating system will look on Macs in bright light situations, where glare already impacts visibility. But overall, Popov is enamored with this “really fresh” look from Apple. “I think it will make everything look bigger and allow you to read or interact with the UI with more comfort,” says Popov.

He thinks the shift away from flatness is the right design move. “I’m excited that Apple is reintroducing feelings to their digital surfaces, creating interfaces that shimmer, bend, and breathe.” Puckett hopes this ignites a larger design trend of more expressive, experiential software.', 'Now, the hard part for developers begins: incorporating this new look. As Yu works on building Apple apps, he also appreciates the “beautiful” new aesthetic but is anxious about the feasibility of matching this vibe as a small team. In general, Yu remains unsure about how well Apple’s new suit is going to fit.', ""“Apple is doing a great job in trying to pull us forward somewhere. It's very brave to do this.

Forget the fact that both of those products underwhelmed once they launched — they were at least something new for Apple to talk about.', ""But barring a surprise, it doesn't look like there will be any major new unveilings at WWDC this week. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who is exceptionally dialed into Apple, has a preview of what's on tap and it all seems underwhelming: Even the most ardent Apple fans are unlikely to be excited about new interfaces, icons, and names."", 'And while Apple is scrambling to catch up in AI — turns out a bunch of the stuff it showed off last year has yet to actually materialize — it won\'t have much progress to announce this week.

Here's a look at what he's facing right now:"", ""Tariff trouble: Exactly how much will Apple have to pay to bring in new phones and other gadgets to the US from China? And what happens if they shift production — or at least final assembly — of those products to India or Vietnam? Who knows? Donald Trump's tariff policies remain fluid at best."", ""Trump continues to insist that he wants Apple to build its products in the US — regardless of whether that's possible — and the spectre of some kind of Trump-imposed tax that makes Apple products much more expensive remains a real possibility."", ""AI angst: Apple has two very big problems when it comes to AI. As my colleague Alistair Barr points out, Apple's competitors have long, long leads in AI research, and it's unclear if Apple will ever be able to keep up. Right now, it can't even provide working versions of stuff it showed off a year ago."", ""There's a possible future where Apple does just fine not having cutting-edge AI because it can simply use its massive distribution advantage — a billion-plus Apple devices in people's pockets. But being wholly dependent on other people for tech that's supposed to be table stakes in a few years isn't a great place to be."", 'Government headaches: Regulators around the world have been lining up to take a crack at Apple — including the US Department of Justice, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company a year ago. (A separate federal antitrust against Google could also hurt Apple, by potentially ending a long-standing deal where Google pays Apple more than $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on iPhones.)', ""Apple's most persistent foe seems to be the European Union, which has come out with a series of rulings and judgments against Apple. Some of these don't seem crucial to Apple's future — see, for instance, its move to change the charging ports on its phone to adapt to an EU mandate a few years ago."", 'But Apple says an EU ruling forcing it to change the way it runs it powerful App Store is ""yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,"" and is pushing back as hard as it can.

In the case of Fortnite-maker Epic Games, that kicked off a legal fight that started in 2020, and took a sharp turn earlier this year when a US judge ruled that Apple had to allow developers to tell users they could buy stuff from them without going through the App Store — a move that could threaten a huge stream of revenue for Apple."", 'But the app store also generates a vibes problem for Apple, with high-profile critics like Apple blogger John Gruber arguing that Apple has gone from courting developers to making it hard for them to make a living. Apple is most definitely sensitive to that criticism, which is why it often puts out press releases pointing out how much money developers make by selling stuff via Apple.

Apple also introduced a new fitness app called Workout Buddy, which uses an AI-generated voice to speak to you during your workouts.', 'Consumers might soon notice some AI improvements to the non-Apple apps on their phone as well.

Today, a ""Liquid Glass"" redesign was front and center, while Apple Intelligence faded into the background a bit. If you didn\'t have time to watch Apple\'s keynote, here\'s what you missed.', 'Apple usually gives its mobile OS a visual refresh every few years, but Apple says this year\'s ""Liquid Glass"" design is the biggest upgrade since iOS 7 in 2013. It gives apps and menus a more transparent look; they\'re designed to expand and contract as you scroll or browse. It takes a page from visionOS, the interface on Apple\'s pricey Vision Pro headset. On that device, see-through icons make sense since they\'re overlayed on your entire field of view. We\'ll have to see how that translates to smaller devices.', 'Most of us will probably get a first crack at Liquid Glass on the iPhone with iOS 26. No, you didn\'t miss eight versions of Apple\'s mobile OS. The company is changing how its names its OSes, so they\'re all the same. Instead of iOS 19 and macOS 16, it\'ll be iOS 26 and macOS 26, for example, but that applies across the board to iPadOS, visionOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Why not 25? Apple is apparently taking inspiration from automakers, which release ""model year 2026"" cars in 2025.

After its starring role at WWDC 2024, Apple's AI solution sputtered into existence late in 2024 and hasn't done much since. The biggest Apple Intelligence announcement is that the company will open up its LLM to developers, so they can incorporate Apple Intelligence into their apps.

Those of you who shelled out $3,500, however, will get an OS upgrade this fall that promises ""new spatial experiences"" (widgets!). Expect support for 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide field-of-view content from Insta360, GoPro, and Canon. Apple will also let third parties create spatial experiences for visionOS. And it\'s adding support for PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, allowing for more games on the Vision Pro. And visionOS 26 will support more lifelike Personas.', ""Don't forget about Apple TV. Its tvOS also gets the Liquid Glass treatment alongside cinematic poster art, enhanced profile-switching, and a streamlined way to log in to apps. You can opt to have the Apple TV display profiles whenever it wakes up to quickly get where you want to be.

"iOS 26 Brings a New Liquid Glass Redesign, Sassy Look to iPhone",https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/every-new-feature-announced-for-iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass-lock-screen-updates/,"['The newest iPhone system boasts a new design, new name and a host of features to look forward to.', 'At WWDC 2025, Apple just announced iOS 26, a rebranded, new version of the software powering the iPhone. It is due to ship in the fall (likely with new iPhone 17 models), but Apple developers will have access to the developer beta on Monday; a public beta is expected in July.', ""Apple has determined that the future of iPhone is brighter and more translucent with the announcement of the next version of iOS, with a new look called Liquid Glass that takes on visual characteristics of glass similar to the VisionOS interface on Vision Pro. And how do we know it's the future? Because the next iPhone system is now iOS 26, renamed to coincide with next year as part of a lineup-wide rebranding to bring symmetry to the system names, such as MacOS Tahoe 26 and WatchOS 26."", 'After more than a decade of a flat, clean user interface -- a revamp introduced in iOS 7 when former Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive took over the design of software as well as hardware -- the iPhone is getting a new look. The new design extends throughout the Apple product lineup, from iOS to WatchOS, TVOS and iPadOS.', 'The Liquid Glass interface also now enables a third way to view app icons on the iPhone home screen. Not content with Light and Dark modes, iOS 26 now features an All Clear look -- every icon is clear glass with no color. Lock screens can also have an enhanced 3D effect using spatial scenes, which use machine learning to give depth to your background photos.', 'The new All Clear icon look in iOS 26 is part of the Liquid Glass design.', 'Translucency is the defining characteristic of Liquid Glass, behaving like glass in the real world in the way it deals with light and color of objects behind and near controls. But it\'s not just a glassy look: The ""liquid"" part of Liquid Glass refers to how controls can merge and adapt -- dynamically morphing, in Apple\'s words. In the example Apple showed, the glassy time numerals on an iPhone lock screen stretched to accommodate the image of a dog and even shrunk as the image shifted to accommodate incoming notifications. The dock and widgets are now rounded, glassy panels that float above the background.', 'As notifications fill the bottom of the screen, the subject in the background image is pushed up and the time numerals resize to accommodate.', 'The Camera app is getting a new, simplified interface. You could argue that the current Camera app is pretty minimal, designed to make it quick to frame a shot and hit the big shutter button. But the moment you get into the periphery, it becomes a weird mix of hidden controls and unintuitive icons.', 'The Camera app has fewer distractions.', 'Now, the Camera app in iOS 26 features a ""new, more intuitive design"" that takes minimalism to the extreme. The streamlined design shows just two controls: Video or Camera. Swipe left or right to choose modes. Swipe up for settings such as aspect ratio and timers, and tap for additional preferences.', ""With the updated Photos app, viewing the pictures you capture should be a better experience -- a welcome change that customers have clamored for since iOS 18's cluttered attempt. Instead of a long, difficult-to-discover scrolling interface, Photos regains a Liquid Glass menu at the bottom of the screen. "", 'The Photos app gets a welcome redesign.', ""The Phone app has kept more closely to the look of its source than others: a sparse interface with large buttons as if you're holding an old-fashioned headset or pre-smartphone cellular phone. iOS 26 finally updates that look not just with the new overall interface but in a unified layout that takes advantage of the larger screen real estate on today's iPhone models."", ""The Phone app's unified layout should make for less switching between screens when dealing with calls."", ""It's not just looks that are different, though. The Phone app is trying to be more useful for dealing with actual calls -- the ones you want to take. The Call Screening feature automatically answers calls from unknown numbers, and your phone rings only when the caller shares their name and reason for calling."", ""Or what about all the time wasted on hold? Hold Assist automatically detects hold music and can mute the music but keep the call connected. Once a live agent becomes available, the phone rings and lets the agent know you'll be available shortly."", 'The Messages app is probably one of the most used apps on the iPhone, and for iOS 26, Apple is making it a more colorful experience. You can add backgrounds to the chat window, including dynamic backgrounds that show off the new Liquid Glass interface.', 'Enliven your daily chats with backgrounds and more group features.', 'In addition to the new look, group texts in Messages can incorporate polls for everyone in the group to reply to -- no more scrolling back to find out which restaurant Brett suggested for lunch that you missed. Other members in the chat can also add their own items to a poll.', 'A more useful feature is a feature to detect spam texts better and screen unknown numbers, so the messages you see in the app are the ones you want to see and not the ones that distract you.', 'In the Safari app, the Liquid Glass design floats the tab bar above the web page (although that looks right where your thumb is going to be, so it will be interesting to see if you can move the bar to the top of the screen). As you scroll, the tab bar shrinks.', 'Web pages occupy the entire screen and the address bar shrinks to get out of the way.', 'FaceTime also gets the minimal look, with controls in the lower-right corner that disappear during the call to get out of the way. On the FaceTime landing page, posters of your contacts, including video clips of previous calls, are designed to make the app more appealing.', 'FaceTime minimizes its controls into one corner.', ""Do you like the sound of that song your friend is playing but don't understand the language the lyrics are in? The Music app includes a new lyrics translation feature that displays along with the lyrics as the song plays. And for when you want to sing along with one of her favorite K-pop songs, for example, but you don't speak or read Korean, a lyrics pronunciation feature spells out the right way to form the sounds."", 'AutoMix blends songs like a DJ, matching the beat and time-stretching for a seamless transition.', 'And if you find yourself obsessively listening to artists and albums again and again, you can pin them to the top of your music library for quick access.', 'Keep the beat going with intelligence-based song transitions using AutoMix.', ""The iPhone doesn't get the same kind of gaming affection as Nintendo's Switch or Valve's Steam Deck, but the truth is that the iPhone and Android phones are used extensively for gaming -- Apple says half a billion people play games on iPhone."", 'Trying to capitalize on that, a new Games app acts as a specific portal to Apple Arcade and other games. Yes, you can get to those from the App Store app, but the Games app is designed to remove a layer of friction so you can get right to the gaming action.', 'The new Games hub has a simple control screen to let you navigate all of your Apple games on any device.', ""Although not specific to iOS, Apple's new live translation feature is ideal on the iPhone when you're communicating with others. It uses Apple Intelligence to dynamically enable you to talk to someone who speaks a different language in near-real time. It's available in the Messages, FaceTime and Phone apps and shows live translated captions during a conversation."", 'Live translation during a voice call', 'Updates to the Maps app sometimes involve adding more detail to popular areas or restructuring the way you store locations. Now, the app takes note of routes you travel frequently and can alert you of any delays before you get on the road.', 'A Maps widget shows a frequently-used route.', ""It also includes a welcome feature for those of us who get our favorite restaurants mixed up: visited places. The app notes how many times you've been to a place, be that a local business, eatery or tourist destination. It organizes them in categories or other criteria such as by city to make them easier to find the next time."", ""Liquid Glass also makes its way to CarPlay in your vehicle, with a more compact design when a call comes in that doesn't obscure other items, such as a directional map. In Messages, you can apply tapbacks and pin conversations for easy access."", ""Widgets are now part of the CarPlay experience, so you can focus on just the data you want, like the current weather conditions. And Live Activities appear on the CarPlay screen, so you'll know when that coffee you ordered will be done or when a friend's flight is about to arrive."", 'The new CarPlay interface with Liquid Glass.', 'The Wallet app is already home for using Apple Card, Apple Pay, electronic car keys and for storing tickets and passes. In iOS 26, you can create a new Digital ID that acts like a passport for age and identity verification (though it does not replace a physical passport) for domestic travel for TSA screening at airports.', 'The app can also let you use rewards and set up installment payments when you purchase items in a store, not just for online orders. And with the help of Apple Intelligence, the Wallet app can help you track product orders, even if you did not use Apple Pay to purchase them. It can pull details such as shipping numbers from emails and texts so that information is all in one place.', 'The Wallet app supports legal state IDs and national IDs for age and identity verification.', ""Although last year's WWDC featured Apple Intelligence features heavily, improvements to the AI tech were less prominent this year, folded into the announcements during the WWDC keynote."", 'As an alternative to creating Genmoji from scratch, you can combine existing emojis -- ""like a sloth and a light bulb when you\'re the last one in the group chat to get the joke,"" to use Apple\'s example. You can also change expressions in Genmoji of people you know that you\'ve used to create the image.', 'Combine existing emoji using Apple Intelligence.', ""Image Playground adds the ability to tap into ChatGPT's image generation tools to go beyond the app's animation or sketch styles."", ""Visual Intelligence can already use the camera to try to decipher what's in front of the lens. Now the technology works on the content on the iPhone's screen, too. It does this by taking a screenshot (press the sleep and volume up buttons) and then including a new Image Search option in that interface to find results across the web or in other apps such as Etsy."", 'This is also a way to add event details from images you come across, like posters for concerts or large gatherings. (Perhaps this could work for QR codes as well?) In the screenshot interface, Visual Intelligence can parse the text and create an event in the Calendar app.', ""Not everything fits into a keynote presentation -- even, or maybe especially, when it's all pre-recorded -- but some of the more interesting new features in iOS 26 went unremarked during the big reveal. For instance:"", ""The finished version of iOS 26 will be released in September or October with new iPhone 17 models. In the meantime, developers will get access to the first developer betas starting on Monday, with an initial public beta arriving in July. (Don't forget to go into any beta software with open eyes and clear expectations.)"", ""Follow the WWDC 2025 live blog for details about Apple's announcements."", 'iOS 26 will run on the iPhone 11 and later models, including the iPhone SE (2nd generation and later). That includes:', 'This is a developing story.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDFiMWxXUWxVMGIweDZUMVJ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
Is it wrong the iPhone's AI battery management is the only WWDC rumor I'm excited about?,https://www.engadget.com/general/is-it-wrong-the-iphones-ai-battery-management-is-the-only-wwdc-rumor-im-excited-about-143028037.html,"[""Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) kicks off next week — but if I'm honest with myself, I’m struggling to care. I used to watch the shows with eager anticipation as to what new goodies would be coming to my Mac across the next year. But in recent years, a lot of the features highlighted either fell into the bucket marked “wait, you couldn’t do that already?” or the one marked “well, that’s not a thing I’m going to use.”"", 'It doesn’t help the rumored slate of announcements for this year is mostly stuff I know I’m not going to need to engage with. The loudest rumor is a Vision Pro-inspired UI overhaul to bring the iPhone, iPad and Mac in line with their youngest sibling. Consistency is a fine thing to aim for, but Apple is reportedly justifying this change by saying it’s jarring to switch between platforms. I can’t say I’ve ever had an issue, and my concern is Apple will forget that each of those devices is different, and operates in a different way to its stablemates.', 'If a promise is made too often, there’s a risk you’ll stop believing it will ever be fulfilled. Apropos of nothing, Apple’s going to make the iPad more useful as a productivity tool. The rumors hint the slates will get better multitasking and app window management to make it more Mac-esque. But unless iPadOS gets the sort of radical changes that’ll make it operate a lot more like macOS, nothing will change. And I’m doubtful Apple would bring true multitasking to the iPad, lest it eat into Mac sales — not to mention the constraints of its form factor.', ""As someone who is aggressively indifferent toward generative AI and voice assistants, tweaks to Apple Intelligence and Siri leave me similarly cold. I’m not sure I would ever want a gussied up pattern-recognition algorithm writing messages and emails in my voice. Neither am I too into the idea of using generative AI to create images. I'd much rather stay in the real world. Sure, I’m a young man yelling at a cloud, I don’t care."", 'According to Apple, I’m clearly in the minority since the only time I ever engage with Siri is by accident. I can think, type and operate a phone far faster than I can say out loud “Hey Siri, dim my living room lights by 50 percent,” so the slowness of speech irks me. Of course, I’d love a virtual assistant that was as skilled and imaginative as a flesh-and-blood person who could marshal all of my data, organize it and keep me on track. But I don’t believe we’re close to that point, and Apple has failed to deliver on its promises in this area more than once.', 'The only rumored feature that excites me is the “AI-powered” battery management mode for iOS 19 (or 26, as the rumors indicate). I say “AI-powered,” since I’m not sure how much we need to oversell an algorithm that tracks your usage patterns to make power-saving adjustments. But it’s the sort of feature that, if it’s able to make meaningful improvements to the iPhone’s longevity, could be transformative.', 'After all, as a relatively heavy iPhone user, I rarely find my device lasting until the end of the day without a top-up charge. This isn’t a new problem, either, since the iPhone’s battery has been lackluster since the first model was launched in 2007. In a world where most Android handsets boast of multi-day battery life, the iPhone’s battery life remains embarrassing. Yes, you can take that as a not-too-subtle dig at the rumored thin-and-light iPhone Air, which feels to me like the most egregious waste of development resources imaginable.', 'Maybe this is a sign of my subconscious frustration with Apple that it feels so compelled to push forward rather than tidying up behind it. I groused last year that the company gave so much attention to the addition of multitrack recording to Voice Notes despite the feature already being in Garageband. I would love nothing more than Apple to do what it did in 2009 with Snow Leopard and in 2017 with High Sierra. In both of those instances, the company opted to focus on tidying up the existing code to make it smaller and run faster rather than over-extending itself with new features. That, to me, would seem like a far better use of Apple’s time than repainting the home screen with snazzier icons.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDFiMWxXUWxVMGIweDZUMVJ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.', 'CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like ""beautiful,"" ""gorgeous"" and ""delightful"" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.', ""Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface."", ""Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025."", 'Alan Dye, Apple\'s vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company\'s  ""broadest design update ever."" ', 'A hallmark feature of the new OS is Liquid Glass, described by the company as an ""expressive material"" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once. ', 'Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments. ', '""From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,"" said Dye during the company\'s keynote Monday.', ""Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received."", '""So if you\'re making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,"" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.', 'Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online — say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps — and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, ""What material is this made of?""', 'Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example. ', 'Still lingering on Apple\'s to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year\'s conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. ""We\'re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,"" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. ""This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.""', 'In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.', 'The last time your iPhone got a major redesign was in 2013, when Jony Ive still worked at Apple, Facebook was still the only social network worth caring about, and a Brit hadn’t won Wimbledon for 77 years. Come 2025, Jony Ive works for OpenAI, your mum is still on Facebook, and Andy Murray has retired after as many hip surgeries as Wimbledon triumphs. In other words, iOS has long been due a refresh, so it’s getting one alongside a whole suite of welcome new features.', 'Announced at Apple’s annual WWDC 2025 conference in Cupertino, California, iOS 26’s Liquid Glass update brings a fresh aesthetic to your iPhone—one that borrows several tricks from that pricey Vision Pro headset it dropped last year. Still, there’s more that’s coming soon to iPhone beyond its facelift. From a much-improved Phone app to new live translation skills, here’s what’s set to launch later this year alongside the forthcoming iPhone 17. Oh, and there’s an update on Apple Intelligence too.', 'Last year’s big iPhone update was meant to herald the launch of Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the rise of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Perplexity. It promised a lot with a leveled-up Siri and clever examples of cross-app functionality (such as quickly sharing your flight arrival time from Mail to Messages) and has mainly delivered Genmoji and some ChatGPT integration so far. So at WWDC 25, Apple called a mulligan on Apple Intelligence. The game-changing stuff is still coming, but not for a while. In the meantime, iOS 26 has its Liquid Glass update to be getting on with.', ""Apple's Liquid Glass UI upgrade in Home Screen form"", 'OK. Onto the exciting stuff: iOS 26’s new Liquid Glass look. The iPhone’s visual vibe of late is best described as bright, flat, and big on rounded corners. Liquid Glass adds a more layered approach to that aesthetic with a greater use of transparency and visual elements that melt around both your apps and Home Screen. It’s an undeniably slick approach to iOS, and you’re going to see it everywhere when it soon rolls out across all of Apple’s first-party apps and devices. Yep, the Watch, Mac, iPad and beyond will be using it.', 'No, you didn’t miss eight iterations of new iPhone operating systems before iOS 26. Just as all of Apple’s operating systems—from iPadOS to watchOS—are set to benefit from its Liquid Glass glow up, they’re also borrowing their name from the year ahead. Why? Simplicity really.

Apple's secret sauce is exactly what AI is missing,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-secret-sauce-is-exactly-what-ai-is-missing/,"['One of my editors once told me that a cynic will always sound more rational, but that doesn\'t mean they\'re right. French statesman Francois Guizot basically said the same thing from another POV: ""The world belongs to optimists. Pessimists are only spectators.""', 'Apple\'s AI strategy has a lot of cynics and pessimists right now -- and they sound pretty rational based on what we\'ve seen during the past 12 months. The long-awaited revamp of Siri never materialized. Apple\'s vision of your own custom AI-powered assistant with your ""personal context"" has been little more than a hopeful vision. And the AI features that have arrived -- such as summaries of a string of text messages -- have been both game-changing and, at times, super frustrating to use. ', ""Also: Could WWDC be Apple's AI turning point? Here's what analysts are predicting"", ""Still, the new AI revolution that is sweeping the tech industry -- and soon the planet -- is in desperate need of many of the qualities that Apple usually exemplifies in its approach to products. I'm talking about qualities like polish, attention to detail, user trust, and patience."", ""While generative AI is racing forward at a breakneck pace, it continues to feel half-baked and overhyped much of the time. I'm confident that's why ZDNET/Aberdeen research showed that only 8% of the broader public say they're willing to pay for AI features on their devices. Even more challenging, 69% said they would stop using a product or consider stopping if it had AI features that they couldn't turn off."", 'In other words, our research shows a massive gap between the next-big-thing narrative that companies like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others are telling us about the AI revolution and the lack of enthusiasm from the people who are learning about these new AI features and trying to use them in the real world.', 'Also: Is ChatGPT Plus still worth $20 when the free version packs so many premium features?', ""Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to be excited about. If you've used one of these generative AI tools to summarize a 500-page document for you, help you write a recommendation letter, or translate a document from a relatively obscure language into English, then you've gotten a taste of how useful they can be in the right circumstances. And if you're a coder or a programmer, generative AI is a life-changer. "", ""But if you've used chatbots for much time at all and started double-checking their accuracy, then you've likely also come across the fact that products like ChatGPT regularly hallucinate, make stuff up, and simply get things wrong. In short, they can't be fully trusted, and that limits a lot of their usefulness because you often have to double-check their work."", ""(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)"", 'Also: 3 Apple Intelligence features that would convince me to ditch Gemini and ChatGPT', ""Last year at WWDC 2024, Apple spent a lot of time trying to convince us that it's an AI leader, that it's been working on AI for years, and that it had exciting new AI breakthroughs on the way that only Apple could deliver because of its broad ecosystem of devices and platforms and its strong privacy stance."", ""It was a bold move since Apple rarely talks about future products and features until they are nearly fully baked. In retrospect, last year's AI blitz at WWDC was unnecessary. "", ""Apple didn't need to enter the AI features arms race, in which OpenAI, Google, and a constellation of tech giants and cash-rich startups are playing a relentless game of one-upmanship."", ""That's not where Apple can compete, and it's not where Apple can make the biggest impact in tech's next big wave of innovation. "", ""Apple simply needs to run the Apple playbook. One example that was on the right track at last year's WWDC was when Apple focused on integrating AI feature-by-feature into its existing software, such as Messages, Genmoji, and the Mail app. There are a lot of existing features on the iPhone, for example, that could be enhanced, streamlined, and made more powerful -- all outside of the chatbot. "", ""When it comes to Siri, Apple has likely realized that it needs to start over from the ground up. The codebase for Siri goes back decades to old government projects in DARPA, and my understanding from people with knowledge of the code is that retrofitting it for today's uses has created a classic innovator's dilemma that has hindered Siri for a decade and kept it from keeping up with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and now ChatGPT. "", 'Also: Only 8% of Americans would pay extra for AI, according to ZDNET-Aberdeen research', ""That doesn't necessarily mean Apple needs to acquire its way into competition with LLMs and the latest chatbots. Anthropic's Claude regularly gets mentioned as a good fit for Apple because of Anthropic's focus on privacy and AI safety. However, Anthropic was valued at $61.5B in March 2025, so an acquisition would cost over $100B. That makes it very unlikely Apple or anyone else is buying Anthropic. "", 'Apple has AI talent and it has time. The generative AI revolution is still just beginning to take flight. Even if it took two years to rebuild the foundation of Siri for the age of LLMs, it would be worth it -- and lots of users will still be at the very beginning of their journey with AI in 2027.

Apple needs to offer something compelling with iOS 26, as the last few updates have been relatively minor (Apple Intelligence being the most significant new feature, which has been plagued with problems)."", 'Thankfully, the rumor mill has been churning out potential new iOS 26 features regularly, and it sounds exciting. Here are the most significant new features we expect to see when Apple launches iOS 26 at WWDC 25.', '', ""The centerpiece of the next version of iOS is reportedly a massive visual overhaul. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has three key focuses for the new interface: simpler to use, faster to navigate and easier to learn."", '""The big thing with this redesign is consistent controls, icons, buttons, user interface dynamics and mechanisms across both iOS and macOS,"" said Gurman in a report.', ""The alleged codename for this new interface design is Solarium, and it will reportedly be consistent across all of Apple's new software and borrow the look of visionOS."", 'Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.', ""A big look at what iOS 26 could look like came from a Jon Prosser video.

That's a long time for a popular OS to remain relatively stagnant, so I'm very excited to see what Apple does."", '', ""Apple has to knock it out of the park with Apple Intelligence. Whether the company calls it Apple Intelligence 2.0 or something else entirely, the original launch wasn't good. Apple typically doesn't launch a half-baked product, but that's precisely what happened with the company's race to catch up in the AI space."", 'Some new changes expected to arrive on iOS 26 include: Siri’s AI upgrades, new third-party AI integrations, iPhone battery improvements and expanding AI into more apps.', ""Siri in particular is way behind Google Gemini Live and ChatGPT. Apple isn't rumored to have a true competitor that can handle live conversations and multi-modal support for audio and video until next year. But we could could get other promised upgrades like personal context awareness (think emails, photos, and calendar), on-screen awareness, and deeper app integration in iOS 26. It just might not happen right away."", 'The biggest thing Apple needs to do is make Apple Intelligence good. As the main selling point of iOS 18, it underdelivered. The company has another chance to make a good impression, as users want the AI built into their phone to work well. However, if Apple drops the ball again, it might be tough to win users over.', ""While this might seem like a minor change, knowing how long it'll take your phone to charge is a helpful feature when you're in a hurry. And this should be an iOS 26 feature."", ""According to some reputable leakers, you'll be able to look at your iPhone's lock screen and see how long you must wait for a full charge. Knowledge is power, and this feature is most definitely a powerful one that's worth getting excited about."", '', 'According to a report in 9to5Mac, there are two notable upgrades coming to Messages in iOS 26. The first is polls. So, for example, you could insert a poll in a text thread about possible restaurant options. Apple may even suggest and format polls based on the context of the conversation.', '', 'The second upgrade is more niche. Apparently Apple is working on automatic translation for incoming and outgoing messages if you happen to be texting someone who speaks a different language.', 'Apple is reportedly going to add Markdown support to the Apple Notes app. This would enable users to more easily export notes, as Markdown is a plain text format. It would presumable make keyboard-driven formatting easier and make it simpler to switch to other note-taking apps.', '', ""If you happen to use Apple Music, you'll be happy to know that Apple may be bringing full-screen animated album art to your lock screen on the iPhone. This could look pretty slick, and I hope Spotify is allowed to do the same thing, as it makes listening to music part of the OS experience."", '', ""Apple CarPlay could be getting a major facelift with iOS 26, as it's rumored to mirror the same Solarium AI overhaul as the iPhone itself. Not much else is known at this point, but for people who use their iPhone with their car, this could be a big deal."", '', ""According to Apple, the Accessibility Nutrition Labels will bring a new section to App Store product pages that highlight accessibility features within apps and games. Basically, you can use this these labels to find out if an app is accessible or if it won't be."", 'Like any major OS update, Apple is expected to add numerous accessibility features to iOS 26.

Essentially, it will replace the often-forgotten Game Center app and add new functionality that was previously unavailable. For mobile gamers, this alone is worth getting excited about, as it signals that Apple still considers games an essential part of iOS.', 'Other rumored updates include live translation in the Translate app, allowing it to further compete with Google Translate (which can now be made the default on iOS).', 'Apple is also expected to enhance the Health App with Apple Health+.

Apple’s Liquid Glass was a wild change to my iPhone,https://www.theverge.com/apple/683914/apple-iphone-ios-26-changes-liquid-glass,"['Things are a lot shinier.', '', 'After staring at, scrolling through, and puzzling over Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language on my iPhone for the better part of an afternoon, I don’t hate it. But I also think it needs a little more time in the kiln.', 'Apple announced Liquid Glass on Monday for all of its devices at WWDC 2025. Perhaps the most noticeable thing about it is that app icons, tab bars, and even the text magnifier you’ll see when you hover over words feel, well, liquid-y and glassy.', 'The idea seems to be that because they’re “floating” a layer over things like your lockscreen wallpaper or text, the “glass” can be translucent to give you a sense of what’s under them. It makes sense. The initial implementation in the iOS 26 developer beta has many of Apple’s signature flourishes and attention to detail.', 'But boy are the changes jarring when you first see them.', 'Let me show you just how dramatically it changes things. Below, on the left is a picture of my iOS 18 lockscreen I shared with David Pierce for the Installer newsletter just last month, and on the right is my lockscreen today, on my iPhone 16 Pro with the iOS 26 developer beta (out now) installed.', 'Even in my intentionally grayscale homescreen, I hope you can see that the differences are immediately apparent. Everything is transparent and shiny.', 'Here’s my homescreen with the color added back in, if you want a different way to look at it. Many icons are familiar, but they’re all… bubblier.', 'Here’s the Control Center, which is frankly a mess right now. The transparency of Liquid Glass makes it look cluttered, and that’s even with my gray homescreen. I hope Apple makes everything under the Control Center a little more opaque so that it’s easier to read at a glance.', 'The Clock app shows a good example of the finer details that have changed. The bottom tab bar is rounded, and when you tap different tabs, the selector shifts over in an animation that I can best describe as a water droplet moving across the tab. (Pressing and holding the droplet allows you to drag it across the tab bar, which is an admittedly cool effect.) You might also notice that the button to turn the alarm on and off is more oval than circular.', 'And here are a few other tidbits that I thought would be worth sharing. The iOS keyboard has an all-new look:', 'The Settings app has way too much space between each setting category (which is a problem I’ve also noticed in the messages list in Messages):', 'Things under the URL bar in Safari will “bend” due to the Liquid Glass design:', 'And system prompts look different:', 'At first, I hated the big changes. That surprised me. I’m usually fine with UI tweaks. Back in the day, I was on board with even the earliest and worst versions of iOS 7. But after a couple of hours with the iOS 26 developer beta, Liquid Glass is growing on me.', 'My iPhone still functions like it used to. I have a lot of small complaints, especially with the spacing of settings functions and Control Center. But I expect Apple will tweak and fix a lot of the bigger issues ahead of the official launch of iOS 26 this fall.', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

Last year's WWDC saw the official unveiling of Apple Intelligence — the company's set of updates involving machine learning and language models that its competitors Google and Microsoft had already teed up years ago. At WWDC 2025, we expect to see the usual announcements around the next versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and visionOS."", 'But instead of various different numbers indicating the generation of each platform like before, this year might see the company adopt a unified year-based naming standard that would result in things being called iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and such as opposed to iOS 19 and watchOS 12 as anticipated.', ""If you want to watch Apple's keynote presentation for yourself, check out how to watch WWDC 2025 for details on the various places you can find the livestream. For those who prefer following along a third-party liveblog that's largely text- and image-based, scroll down for our coverage right here!"", ""The keynote starts at 1PM ET (or 10AM PT) but our liveblog begins hours before that, as we plan to share our experience and impressions live from Apple Park in Cupertino. You should absolutely join us around 10AM ET for the full experience to feel like you're right here with us. The pictures of snacks alone should be worth it."", 'Update, 1:43PM ET: See our evolving recap of everything Apple has announced at WWDC 2025.', 'I see nothing wrong with ending on fried chicken, but I will let this slide(r).', ""Oh hey, just signing off for the night. We'll be back tomorrow with plenty more from WWDC!"", ""Mostly didn't want to let a chicken sandwich be the lasting memory of this liveblog, not going to lie."", 'Apple just served dinner here at the visitor center where media attendees are set up to work between our briefings. The Szechuan hot chicken slider in particular was fantastic.', ""Will Shanklin took note of the big iPadOS multitasking update (as well as improved Files support and menu bars in apps) and feels like the gap between the iPad and Mac is smaller than ever. But Apple's reliance on the App Store might be the last thing separating the two devices — and something that keeps the Mac as a better option for a lot of people."", '""iPadOS 26 makes Apple\'s tablet much more like macOS. Better windowing? Check. The menu bar? Yup. There\'s even a more fine-tuned Files app, along with document editing in Preview. It\'s as if Apple took a checklist of longtime power-user requests and fulfilled them all. It\'s enough that the App Store\'s walled garden could be the last remaining reason to stick with your Mac.""', 'Read more: Apple’s walled garden is the iPad’s biggest roadblock to becoming a Mac', ""As usual, Apple is unifying the Mac, iPhone and iPad. It's been a theme for years, and it was a major focus of today's keynote. Among the features being shared across platforms is a new Phone app for the Mac that uses your iPhone's cellular signal to make calls. This has been a feature for years, but the new Phone app should make it a better experience. It also piqued Ian Carlos Campbell's interest."", '""While it still remains more of a dream than an obvious stop on Apple’s product roadmap, the company’s updates in macOS Tahoe 26 offer new evidence that Apple could one day sell Macs with cellular connectivity. Sure, the biggest takeaway from WWDC 2025 will probably be the new Liquid Glass design language the company is sprinkling over all of its operating systems, but based on the addition of a Phone app to macOS, Apple’s laptops and phones are converging in more ways than one.""', 'Read more: The Phone app in macOS 26 is another baby step towards a cellular Mac', 'The WWDC keynote ended in strange fashion, but it was Anna Washenko\'s favorite part of the day. As she says, ""the final three minutes of a full band performing real reviews of apps became the actual highlight of WWDC for me.""', 'Read more: Every WWDC should end with a song composed of app reviews', 'Checking back in here — Cherlynn and I have had a busy afternoon of meetings and recording a podcast. Good times! In the meantime, our crew back home has written some hilarious and thought-provoking little stories about everything we’ve seen. Here are a few of my favs.', 'Nate and I are currently at the visitor center in Apple Park, where media attendees are getting lunch and using the space to finish filing stories. Today\'s menu includes a grilled chicken salad, ""California Roll crab roll"" and a ""Garden-smoked carrot lox on pumpernickel."" Dessert options feature oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies. I\'m bummed that the matcha sugar cookie from previous years isn\'t here, but maybe that\'s just reserved for the September iPhone launches.', 'It\'s been a common refrain for many years: iPads are great for lean-back content consumption, but when you need to get ""real work"" done, you toggle over to a full-fledged computer — Mac or otherwise. Apple has inched closer to making the iPad more productivity-friendly in recent years with additions like Stage Manager, but a lot of creatives still hit a wall with tasks like windows management or app switching.', 'But iPadOS 26 (the new year-based moniker for the tablet operating system) may finally change that. Better windowing, a real menu bar, a full-fleged Preview app, an improved Files app and better handling of audio and video capture all look to be big wins for iPad-based creators (and podcasters specifically). And the icing on the cake for power users is background tasking, which should finally allow things like video and audio file rendering while you multi-task.', ""Read more: iPadOS 26 makes Apple's tablets more like Macs"", ""At $3,500, Apple's Vision Pro headset is still a hard sell for the vast majority of users — even those looking for bleeding-edge virtual reality. But with visionOS 26 — the third iteration of the Vision's operating system coming this fall — existing users of the headset are getting quite a few upgrades."", 'First and foremost, Vision Pro users will gain compatibility with PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. That should open up some serious gaming options, since the Vision Pro was previously limited to hand gestures.', 'Apple headset users will also get support for eye-scrolling, which means they can (you guessed it) navigate documents and websites with their eyes.', 'And while Apple made a point of emphasizing the unified ""liquid glass"" look and feel across all its newly updated operating systems, that design language was effectively already infused into the Vision\'s interface.', ""Read more: Apple's visionOS 26 brings eye-scrolling and support for PS VR2 controllers"", ""Cherlynn and I will be taking meetings and demoing a whole bunch of these new software features over the next two days — definitely stay tuned here, as we're just formulating how we feel about this year's updates and what they'll mean to actual users as well as developers."", ""During Apple's WWDC keynote event today in Cupertino, company execs announced, among other things, the latest Apple Watch software: watchOS 12, er, watchOS 26. Like iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest, the latest generation of watchOS will now be appended with the upcoming year, instead of a sequential number. What would have been watchOS 12, is now watchOS 26."", 'Aside from the new name, there\'s a new look for watchOS, too. Apple gave its entire suite of software a redesign, one that takes aesthetic cues and the ""physicality and richness"" of visionOS, the software used in the company\'s VR headset, the Vision Pro. It\'s the biggest redesign since iOS 7. The look is called ""liquid glass"" and dynamically reacts to movement and responds to the content on screen. Menus now better fit to the rounded corners of the hardware. Notifications and other information now involve translucent backgrounds, giving the interface a glass-like appearance.', 'Read more: watchOS 26: Everything Apple announced for its wearable at WWDC 2025', ""OK everyone, thank you so much for hanging around with us! That was one of the tighter presentations Apple has done in a while. I feel like there is a lot more day-to-day useful features for people this year, kind of like WWDC events of old. There was less Apple Intelligence, but the stuff they did show off feels more genuinely useful than last year. I don't care about Genmoji, but the improvements to thinks like spam call / message detection, live translation and so on feel a lot more meaningful to me."", ""That was... incredibly weird, but I didn't hate it?"", ""So long macOS Sequoia, hello macOS Tahoe 26. Apple's next desktop operating system will feature the company's Liquid Glass UI, but at this point, it doesn't look like there will be any truly transformative features like last year's iPhone mirroring. But hey, at least Apple isn't trying to make us excited about widgets again. Just like the rest of Apple's new software, Tahoe's version number has also been updated to reflect the upcoming year — previously, we expected it to be macOS 16. While that may take some getting used to, it's easier than trying to remember the different version numbers across Apple's platforms."", 'At first glance, Apple\'s Liquid Glass refresh almost seems like a rehash of the ""Aero"" design Microsoft used in Windows Vista (which came out nearly 20 years ago, yikes). True to its name, a varying degree of transparency is key to Apple\'s new aesthetic — that includes a fully transparent menu bar, as well new light and dark tints for those respective display modes. Basically, it looks like macOS Tahoe will be Apple\'s most customizable desktop OS yet.', ""Read more: macOS Tahoe 26 will bring Apple's new Liquid Glass UI to your desktop"", ""I'm so glad — it's actually over with no surprises. Guess that Apple logo-ed suitcase I saw at the airport was probably fake like the dozens of people on Threads said. We have a bunch of briefings at Apple Park today, and Nate and I will be hard at work making sense of everything we learn in these sessions, which will typically offer more in-depth looks at the new features announced just now. Stick around, as we'll publish more stories based on what we learn, and I'll continue to update this liveblog with nuggets we learn through the day."", '""Saved my marriage / I would kiss this app if I could.""', '""Being a human is hard, and this is helpful.""', ""Oh my god.

It’s integrated into messages, FaceTime and phone,” said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple.', 'The new features could help Apple’s messaging platform stay competitive with those from Meta and Google. The search giant, for example, recently updated its spam text detection technology, while Meta’s WhatsApp lets users conduct polls and customize their backgrounds.', 'Apple users can do more than turning text description into a genmoji — they can mix together two emojis to create something new.', 'Genmojis are getting more customization features: changing expression, hairstyles, and others.', 'Users can now also make images using ChatGPT.', '“Nothing is shared with ChatGPT without your permission,” said Leslie Ikemoto, Apple ‘s director of input experience.', 'Apple is putting users’ favorite contacts, recent calls and voicemails all on one page, along with AI-voicemail summaries, “so your most used features are right at your fingertips without having to switch views.”', 'The company is also improving call screening to help users gauge when a call from an unknown number may be a scammer or telemarketer. The tool will automatically answer calls from unknown numbers and obtain the caller’s name and reason for the call, and show their response in text when the phone rings.', 'iPhone users will also get hold assist — where the phone app will hold a users’ place in line until a live agent comes on, without requiring them to listen to annoying hold music. Google already offers similar technology.', 'Apple’s phone app will also be able to translate voice and FaceTime calls during conversations, following in Samsung’s footsteps.', 'Apple’s CarPlay is getting a refresh.', 'The design will be more compact while driving. There will be widgets for “quick and glanceable” information while driving, said Emily Schubert, director of car experience engineering.', 'Drivers can use CarPlay in light or dark mode.', 'All of these updates will be in “CarPlay Ultra,” which can choose the layout and design of the most important features on the screen in front of the driver, as well as controls like the internal climate control system.', 'With iOS 26, Apple is simplifying the Camera app.', 'Now, when users open the camera app, they’ll see only the two most popular modes — camera and video — although they can swipe to see panoramic or cinematic modes. And users can swipe up to see additional controls, such as camera timers.', 'Apple is also cleaning up its Photos app, following an unpopular redesign last year. There will now be separate tabs for users’ full camera library and their albums, instead of having them together on one long, scrolling page.', 'Apple is unifying the software version numbers across all its platforms.', '“Our releases for the fall that will power us through the coming year 2026 will be version 26,” according to Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.', 'What this means: The upcoming latest versions of software across all Apple products will end with number 26. So it will be iOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, macOS 26, visionOS 26 and iPadOS 26. That gives Apple’s software more consistency across platforms, potentially making it easier for consumers to understand whether their products are running the latest software.', 'Apple announced its software would be getting a makeover at WWDC on Monday.', '“Today marks an exciting and beautiful new chapter for our design, one that sets the stage for our next era of our products and how you interact with them,” Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface design, said.', 'Apple is calling its new software design interface “Liquid Glass.” The new design will feature see-through visuals that appear to have a glossy surface.', '“It beautifully retracts light and dynamically reacts to your movement with specular highlights,” Dye said.', 'This is the largest software design overhaul for Apple since it launched iOS 7 in 2013, Dye said.', 'At last year’s WWDC, Apple announced a smarter, more useful, artificial intelligence-enhanced version of Siri. But it later indefinitely delayed the launch of that new-and-improved Siri.', 'Now, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi says more information about the Siri upgrade is coming later this year.', '“As we’ve shared, we’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,” Federighi said. “This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”', 'While the new Siri may not be coming right away, Apple is now opening up its on-device AI model to third-party app developers. That will mean iOS users could see more AI-enabled features on apps like Kahoot or AllTrails.', 'The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference is underway in the tech giant’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. The annual event is where the company announces updates to the software that runs on billions of Apple devices used worldwide.', 'The iPhone maker is expected to announce relatively modest updates to its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features, such as new translation capabilities, as well as changes that will affect iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches and more.', 'Why this matters: Rivals have surged ahead on AI. Google, for example, announced a flurry of updates last month, including more advanced AI search, shopping and productivity capabilities. And steep AI competition aside, Apple is still having a rough year, with ongoing slow iPhone sales growth and a trade war threatening to force the company to raise prices.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

While on stage at WWDC, the company pitched it as a unified design language coming to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Vision Pro, and Apple TV."", 'Liquid Glass is Apple\'s biggest design update since iOS 7 -- which famously ditched skeuomorphic features in favor of a flat look. Apple said Liquid Glass layers semitransparent ""glass"" materials throughout iOS 26, iPadOS 26, MacOS 15, WatchOS 10, TVOS 16, and VisionOS 4. This translucent look can refract and reflect whatever\'s behind it and adapt its tint for both light and dark modes.', 'Also: How to install iOS 26 on your iPhone (and which models support it)', ""Rumors had hinted that Apple's next UI overhaul would introduce glass-like translucency. At WWDC 2025, those whispers became reality with the unveiling of Liquid Glass, a unified, cross-platform design language. Apple demonstrated how Liquid Glass adds consistent depth, translucency, and motion-responsive effects across its entire device lineup."", 'Also: Your entire iPhone screen is now searchable with new Visual Intelligence features', 'For instance, on the iPhone\'s Lock Screen, the time numerals can now ""nestle"" into your wallpaper and pick up its colors. Meanwhile, in MacOS 15, the Dock and menu bar can go fully transparent or take on tinted or clear looks that let your wallpaper, widgets, and icons shine. And across apps like Safari, Apple Music, News, and Podcasts, tab bars float in a frosted-glass layer -- shrinking when you scroll down to put content front and center and re-expanding when you scroll back up.', 'Also: Apple will bring any photo on the iPhone to life with 3D spatial effects', 'Apple confirmed that Liquid Glass spans its entire software lineup:', 'As with previous years, developer and public betas of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and the rest will roll out over the summer, with final public releases and new hardware arriving around September 2025.', ""Get the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.""]",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDFiMWxXUWxVMGIweDZUMVJ0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

The first people to gain access will be developers, who were watching the WWDC keynote keenly. And that’s when the new name was confirmed as iOS 26 instead of the iOS 19 that you’d expect to follow the current iOS 18.', 'The new name is going to be standardized across the range of software platforms, such as macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and watchOS 26. Full details of this here.', 'Traditionally, developer beta releases come the same day as the keynote. Once, the new software was available during the keynote, but the sight of thousands of developers attempting to download files at the same time must have been enough to cause the most confident of wi-fi providers a case of the heebeejeebees.', 'Whatever the reason, it’s no longer available to download during the conference, but it’s now been confirmed that Monday, June 9 is indeed the day of release for the developer betas — at the time of writing the betas had not been released, and there is an expectation that uptake will be keen, not least because of the radical design overhaul coming to every platform.', 'The Prompt: Get the week’s biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.', '', '', '', 'As well as iOS 26, thanks to a new naming convention that also applies for other software, the first developer betas of iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26 have now been confirmed to appear at or around the same time, again, on the same day.', 'Next, the software will be available for anyone who’s not a developer. Apple announced this at the keynote. As is usual, the first public beta will be available in the month following WWDC, that is, July. This enables Apple to release a couple of betas to developers, maybe even three, before taking the latest one and making it the first public beta. This promises a greater level of stability for the public to use. Even so, it’s still recommended to install the beta on a secondary device as there are likely to be issues, especially early in the beta cycle.', 'Both developer and public beta releases will continue through the summer, usually with increasing frequency, until the final release to the general public is ready. Which is the moment that everybody can get involved.', 'Apple invariably releases iOS in September, coinciding with the latest iPhone series. Assuming there’s no change this year, the full general release is likely to come in about the third week of September.', 'The next iPhones will be released on a Friday (which Friday is to be confirmed), and the software is often released a couple of days beforehand, usually on a Wednesday.', 'Not everyone likes to jump aboard a new OS straight away, but Apple has you covered here: alongside the general release of iOS 26, there will be simultaneous releases of iOS 18 software that ensures users can enjoy the benefits of security updates while they decide when to plump for iOS 26.', 'Expect this to continue for at least the first two months, that is to late October or November. Eventually these extra iOS 18 updates will cease and the only way to stay up to date will be to take the leap to iOS 26. By that time, with luck, everybody will feel it’s stable enough to be a no-brainer.', 'The software will be compatible with the 2025 iPhone hardware releases, and plenty of iPhones that went on sale before that, though not all of the features which will be unveiled at WWDC will work on all iPhones — just as Apple Intelligence only features on the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.', 'One Community.
