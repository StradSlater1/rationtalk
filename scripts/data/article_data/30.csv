The Nintendo Switch 2 launches today. Here’s what to know,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/tech/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-what-to-know,"['Markets', '', 'Fear & Greed Index', 'Latest Market News', '', '', 'It’s a big day for Nintendo fans. The gaming giant’s new console, the Switch 2, arrives on store shelves globally after being announced in April — marking Nintendo’s first major console launch since the original Switch arrived roughly eight years ago.', 'And fans have clearly been waiting; 2.2 million people applied for a lottery system to buy the Switch 2 in Japan, according to a translation of an X post from Nintendo in April. Nearly all US Best Buy stores opened just after midnight to accommodate eager fans.', 'The Switch 2, priced at $450 in the US, can be played in handheld mode, when propped up on a table; or on a TV when plugged in to its accompanying dock, like its predecessor. While the formula is the same as that of the original Switch, Nintendo has made significant upgrades to the hardware, including giving its new console a larger screen, upgraded versions of the Joy-Con controllers and new social features.', 'Nintendo’s decision to stick with a winning template for the Switch 2 is a testament to the original’s popularity — but also a gamble that its success will endure for the better part of the next decade. While the 2017-era Switch introduced gamers to the concept of a home console that also serves as a portable game machine, the Switch 2 doubles down on that idea, amid growing competition from PC rivals like Valve and Lenovo that have emerged over the last three years.', 'But Nintendo’s catalogue of beloved characters and games could give it an edge against rivals. Gamers typically buy a Nintendo console because they want exclusive games, like “Super Mario” or “The Legend of Zelda,” despite owning another gaming device.', '“The cross ownership rates historically between people that would own an Xbox or a PlayStation or a gaming PC, and who also own a Nintendo device, have always been pretty high compared to other systems,” Mat Piscatella, executive director for video game coverage at market research firm Circana, told CNN in April.', 'The Switch 2 iterates its predecessor with several new features, including a Game Chat function that lets gamers communicate with other players by tapping a button on the console. Up to 12 players can chat at the same time, and players can share their screen in real time even when playing other games. Nintendo will also allow users to share certain games with other Switch owners while playing in person even if the other player doesn’t own the title.', 'Nintendo is also bringing some of its signature quirkiness to the Switch 2’s social features; in addition to sharing their screen and video chatting with others, players’ faces will pop up in a tiny bubble near their character in the Switch 2 edition of “Super Mario Party: Jamboree” — an effort to make it feel like players are part of the game itself. However, it requires Nintendo’s $55 camera that’s sold separately.', '“Being able to now take that (multiplayer) experience and virtually create it, we think, is something special, because we know more and more people are playing online,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNN in April.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nNintendo is sticking with a winning formula for the Switch 2. But will it be enough?', 'The Switch 2’s Joy-Con controllers, which attach to the Switch when it’s being used as a handheld console or can be used separately, now support computer mouse-like functionality, unlike the previous version. That will allow players to drag the controllers across a surface — whether it be a table or person’s lap — to control gameplay on screen.', 'One new game called “Drag x Drive” is designed around this idea; players pilot characters in powered-up wheelchair-like vehicles across a basketball court to shoot hoops by sliding and dragging Nintendo’s new controllers. In the Switch 2 version of “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,” players will be able to move the Joy-Con like a mouse for more precise aiming when shooting enemies.', '“People who may play on a PC with a mouse and a keyboard, that’s an experience they can’t replicate,” Bowser said.', 'Nintendo has also given the console hardware a much-needed upgrade. The Switch 2 has a larger 7.9-inch display compared to the original Switch’s 6.2-inch screen, and the Joy-Cons now snap to the console magnetically, which should make them easier to attach or remove from the console. The console has eight times as much storage as its predecessor and the dock supports 4K resolution, two changes that should give players more room to store games and improve how they look when connected to a compatible TV.', 'Nintendo is pointing to these changes to justify the console’s higher price, which is significantly above the $300 original.', '“All of that lends itself to creating a price point that we think is a value to the consumer, because they’ll see the benefit in all these features,” Bowser said. “But it’s also, we think, a reasonable price based on what we’ve been able to build into the device itself.”', 'Nintendo’s major launch title for the Switch 2 is “Mario Kart World,” a new version of its popular cart racing game that lets players drive off-track to explore the world around them. Games coming later this year include “Donkey Kong Bonanza,” which arrives on July 17, “Drag x Drive,” “Kirby Air Riders” and “Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.”', 'The Switch 2 can also run games for the original Switch, although Nintendo says on its website that some games may not be fully compatible or supported. But Nintendo is launching Switch Edition 2 versions of existing games that enable those titles to take advantage of the Switch 2’s new hardware with improved visuals and new gameplay modes.', 'Switch 2 editions of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” and “Tears of the Kingdom” are available now, while “Super Mario Party Jamboree,” “Kirby and the Forgotten Land” and “Pokémon Legends: Z-A” will get Switch 2 editions later this year.', 'Yes, Nintendo still sells previous Switch models including the $200 Switch Lite, $300 standard Switch and $350 Switch OLED.', 'That’s a benefit for shoppers who don’t want to shell out $450, but it could also eat into demand for Nintendo’s new system — especially since many major new titles aren’t out yet.', '“The Switch being so successful is a double-edged sword,” Piscatella said ahead of the Switch 2 debut in April. “On the one hand, a huge, great positive base to build on. On the other hand, a huge target to try to reach in terms of the same level of success.”', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

I streamed Mario Kart World yesterday, tried putting a Switch 2 game in a Switch 1 console, and have spent most of my day today becoming someone who knows what’s what when it comes to HD rumble 2 in Welcome Tour. I may not be ready to give it a grade, but I, along with some of the other editors here at Game Informer who have been spending time with the system, can at least share some of our early impressions.', 'Nintendo sent us a console to start reviewing yesterday, and I booted it up and was instantly charmed by the fact that there was music during the startup screen. We’ve all come to revere the Wii Shop Channel music, and it always made me sad that Wii U and Switch abandoned the soundtrack for various menus. The Switch 2 is still generally a silent platform, but it was nice to hear some original music at least while getting signed in.', 'One of my favorite initial hardware elements is the magnetized Joy-Cons. I used to nervously eject the Switch’s Joy-Cons on and off during load times, and while I still do that here (and worry about long-term wear), I do find the process more satisfying. Feeling them lock back into place is nice, and tearing them away from the magnet feels good.', 'There is obviously lots more to say about Switch 2, but the zoomed-out larger picture is that the system feels good, if safe. I love when Nintendo takes big swings with its hardware, but it has led to some undeniable stumbles. Switch 2 feels like a bunt, but a very confident bunt that feels good in your hands. It’s not the Nintendo Revolution (famously the Wii’s codename prior to launch) we’ve come to expect from Nintendo, but may be exactly what I wanted. – Kyle Hilliard, executive editor', ""After spending several hours with the new system, I'm impressed with what I've encountered. The interface is familiar but tweaked for usability. Transitioning from my old Switch to the new console was relatively straightforward, but I did feel compelled to create new linked Nintendo accounts for my other family members, as there's some weirdness there with what gets erased from your old console otherwise."", ""I've had time to update at least one older game to the new Nintendo Switch 2 version – Tears of the Kingdom. It seems to run well, and I can notice some increase in fidelity, but nothing is world-shaking at first glance."", ""Most of my time has been with Mario Kart World (as I expect will be the case for most people who bring a unit home in the coming days). Our review is forthcoming, but the short version is that it's got some great courses, fun updates to controls and driving, and a more fully considered approach to solo play than prior Mario Kart releases. It's definitely fun, and should welcome all members of the family, regardless of age. – Matt Miller, editor-in-chief"", 'Though booting up the Switch 2 for the first time was underwhelming, as it does little to differentiate itself from the Switch in significant ways from an OS perspective, I was pleasantly surprised by the eShop. The Switch eShop started pretty straightforward before years of shovelware, an unusually large amount of AI hentai-forward games, and an abysmal load rate turned it into my least favorite video game software anything ever. I despised using the eShop. That’s why I’m so thrilled with the Switch 2 eShop. It’s easier to use, clean, and loads fast. Scrolling doesn’t feel like trudging through oatmeal anymore, and the visibility of games is nice. Here’s hoping it remains that way. – Wesley LeBlanc, senior associate editor', ""While I haven't spent much time playing the console yet, I've immediately fallen in love with the improved Joy-Cons. As fun as the gimmick of detaching controllers is, it always felt a little stressful on the base Switch. It's especially stressful to accidentally attach a Joy-Con 1 upside down, forcing you to do an uncomfortably forceful ejection that I was sure would destroy my handheld forever. The new magnets on the Joy-Con 2, however, feel fantastic. It's more secure than I expected and even more intuitive than the last iteration. Also, magnets are just fun to play with! There aren't many instances in my day-to-day life when magnets are relevant, so the sheer sensation of attaching and removing the controllers fills me with an odd childlike wonder. I've no clue how durable they'll be over time – I especially hope Nintendo has fixed the notorious drift problem – but for now, they are a welcome improvement. – Charles Harte, associate editor"", 'Having trouble viewing comments?', 'Try clearing your browser cache, disabling ad blockers, and verifying that cookies are allowed', '© 1991 to 2025 Game Informer.

Don’t wait too long to sell your original Nintendo Switch,https://www.polygon.com/opinion/604120/sell-original-nintendo-switch-now-reselling,"['In the wake of Switch 2 launch, selling your original console might be a good idea right now', 'BY PATRICIA HERNANDEZ', 'The Switch 2 is imminent, which means you may be considering an upgrade. What to do with your old console, though? You could keep it, sure, but the Switch 2 is backwards compatible – and some games have enhancements on the new console. For some of you, selling your Switch might make the most sense, especially if you want some help affording the Switch 2’s $449.99 price tag. If you’re debating hawking your old console, it’s time to take action. The sooner you can do it, the better.', 'As someone who sold a Switch Lite shortly after news of a follow-up dropped, I was surprised to find that typical market values for a used version of the console were quite low on reselling sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace. A Lite in good condition can be sold for anywhere between $100 to $120, or more depending on whether or not it comes with things like games or memory cards. That’s nearly half of what the console cost when it originally came out in 2019, and just barely over what you’d need to afford a new Switch 2 game.', 'A fully-sized Switch 1 in decent shape, on the other hand, can net you anywhere between $165 and $250. Beyond games and accessories, pricing can be impacted by factors like whether or not you still have the original box, cords, and dock. The model also matters; OLED versions command better prices, whereas older models go for slightly cheaper. The exception to this seems to be if you have a Switch from the original launch period, or a Switch with a “low” serial number. This hardware, which is apparently more easily moddable, is sought out by hackers.', 'You also have the option to trade in your console at GameStop, where the credit can go directly toward your Switch 2 purchase. But trade-in values are comparatively abysmal, especially if you don’t have a GameStop Pro membership or if you want cash over store credit. Without a Pro account – which costs money to get – a Switch can only net you up to $85 in store credit, or just under $60 for tender.', 'The GameStop pricing reflects what might be a universal truth in the near future: the longer you wait, the lower the value might become. We’re in that weird interim period where the Switch 2 will be front of mind for gaming communities all over, and the console may well be hard to source near launch. But the average person might not know what a Switch 2 is, or why they might want one. Hardcore fans might be unloading their old consoles left and right, but the proverbial market isn’t as saturated now as it will be once the Switch 2 goes fully mainstream and is visible everywhere. Come the holiday season, families everywhere will be thinking about the latest and greatest tech to give – and used Switch 1 consoles might become a common sight.', 'The chances of seeing values drop even further than where they’re at now are a real possibility as time goes on. We’ve already seen some of it in action; GameStop initially offered a trade-in value of $175 for anyone who put that money toward a Switch 2 pre-order. A couple of months later, they’re offering less than half of what they used to.', 'There’s an argument for holding tight to your Switch 1. Maybe it’s sentimental value. You might want to wait until the Switch 2 has more must-buy games. It’s not like the Switch Lite takes up much space, right? If you play the long game and are willing to keep your Switch for years, you could theoretically get more than what anyone is willing to pay now. To wit, I also sold a 3DS this year. I was able to get over double what anyone was willing to pay for a Switch Lite despite selling it at a slight discount. It also sold for more than what I would have been able to get for a well-kept Switch OLED. That’s the power of retro games for you. Presumably, once the Switch 1 becomes discontinued and less prevalent, it’ll be harder to find – which would make it more valuable.', 'But who has the patience for that? You might be better off selling now than risking an inevitable dip in price if you want a new console. The Switch 2 won’t be getting cheaper anytime soon. If anything, it might get more expensive.', '', 'The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.', '© 2025 VALNET INC.', '', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df
Nintendo Switch 2's Best-Selling eShop Launch Games Revealed — and Those $10 Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom Upgrades Are Right Up There,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-best-selling-eshop-launch-games-revealed-and-those-10-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-upgrades-are-right-up-there,"[""24 hours into the life of Nintendo Switch 2, it's time to look at what's selling best on the new console's eShop — and get a sense of just how popular those rather minimal-looking Zelda upgrades have been."", '', ""Top of the Switch 2 eShop charts at the time of writing is, of course, Mario Kart World — the console's flagship launch title that many (most?) owners will have picked up alongside the console."", ""It's no surprise to see this in the top spot, and anyone who bought the Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World included will have contributed to its placing here, as you'll have had to redeem an eShop code and download its digital version."", ""Next up, perhaps surprisingly, is Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. Developer CD Projekt will no doubt be delighted to see its latest game doing so well on Switch 2, after it previously skipped Nintendo's last-gen console. With the power to run Cyberpunk's Night City now available, Switch 2 owners look to have jumped at the chance to catch up with the open-world RPG. Earlier this week, IGN chatted with CD Projekt to find out how the developer managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 working on Switch 2."", ""Third is Nintendo's own Switch 2 Welcome Tour. This is the $10 collection of mini-games and tech demos that many fans believe should have been offered for free (and after an hour with the game myself last night, I am inclined to agree). Part instruction manual, part interactive museum exhibit, Welcome Tour is at least fairly cheap. (Just remember you'll need a camera and a separate controller/grip with GL/GR buttons to play everything included in it.)"", ""The fourth best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop right now is Fast Fusion, a game which you may not have heard of. This fast-paced sci-fi racer is an interesting addition to the console's launch line-up, as developer Shin'en Multimdia previously released the similar Fast RMX as a launch title for the original Switch, back in March 2017. Why is this series popular with Nintendo fans? Well, because it is essentially F-Zero. And without a new F-Zero from Nintendo anytime soon (if ever again), hardcore Nintendo fans love it."", ""The fifth biggest game on the Switch 2 eShop is not actually a game, but an upgrade — yes, it's the $10 upgrade to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It's interesting to see this chart so highly, as Nintendo Switch Online subscribers do get this add-on included as part of their membership. But perhaps fans have decided they want it to keep? Or maybe they haven't realised. Regardless, the fact this upgrade is so popular clearly shows Nintendo was right to assume people would pay up for some improved visuals (something you get free in upgrades to other titles, such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet), plus access to a new mobile app."", 'Sixth on the Switch 2 eShop right now is Deltarune, which just launched its latest chapters this week. Seventh is the $10 upgrade pack for Zelda: Breath of the Wild (as an older game, perhaps fewer people are still playing it compared to Tears of the Kingdom).', ""In eighth place is relaxing role-player Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, while ninth place goes to Square Enix's Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster. This is followed by Yakuza 0 and Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition."", 'After these, the full Switch 2 Editions of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild sandwich Hitman World of Assassination. And lastly in the chart is Hogwarts Legacy, whose Switch 2 version features a number of graphical upgrades. A $10 upgrade for this Harry Potter prequel RPG is also available if you owned the game on the original Switch.', ""Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is out – here’s everything you need to know,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/05/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-out-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know,"['It’s the first major console launch in five years, so is it worth forking out for? From new tech to add-ons, our guide will help you decide', 'S\nince its announcement in January, anticipation has been building for the Nintendo Switch 2 – the followup to the gaming titan’s most successful home console, the 150m-selling Nintendo Switch. Major console launches are rarer than they used to be; this is the first since 2020, when Sony’s PlayStation 5 hit shelves. Whether you’re weighing up a purchase or just wondering what all the fuss is about, here’s everything you need to know.', 'The Switch 2 is out today, 5 June, priced at £395.99 (US$449.99/A$699/€469.99) or at £429.99 (US$499.99/A$766/€509,99) bundled with its flagship game, Mario Kart World. Like its predecessor, it’s a portable games machine with a built-in screen – you can use as a handheld mini-console when you’re out and about, or slide it into the dedicated dock device and plug it into your TV via an HDMI cable for a big-screen experience at home. A little bigger than the original Switch, with a crisp, clear 7.9in LCD touch screen, as opposed to the old 6.2in display, it comes with two Joy-Con controllers, which are chunkier than the previous versions. These now attach magnetically to each side of the screen with a pleasing clunk, replacing the fiddly sliding mechanism that most Switch owners disliked. They’ve also got bigger L and R buttons on the top, which sounds like a minor detail but is a huge deal for anyone trying to perfect their Mario Kart power-slides.', 'The tech inside the Switch 2 is a lot more advanced than the previous console, featuring a custom nVidia processor, and a screen capable of displaying at 4K resolution (when plugged into a compatible TV) or 1920x1080 resolution in portable mode. It’s also got 5.1 surround sound, and supports high-dynamic range lighting (HDR) graphical effects at frame rates of up to 120hz. This brings the Switch 2 almost up to scratch with other modern consoles: most experts are placing its tech specs somewhere between the PS4 and PS5, or between Xbox One and Xbox Series X.', 'The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, a power adaptor and USB-C charging cable, a dock, a Joy-Con grip (which allows you to connect the two Joy-Cons together to create a traditional-looking games controller), and two Joy-Con wrist straps to stop them flying out of your hands.', 'Nintendo is going big on the social features of the console. Its GameShare function will allow you to play compatible games with other people who don’t own a copy – they just need their own Switch or a Switch 2, and can play along in the room with you or connect online. This is particularly important for families sharing one copy of a game. Meanwhile, GameChat is kind of like Zoom, but for games: you can invite a bunch of pals into a group video chat session where you can talk to each other while playing the same game, playing different games, or just hanging out. If you all buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera you’ll be able to see little video windows of each other on the screen, too. GameChat requires a paid subscription to Nintendo’s online gaming service, which costs £17.99 (US$19.99/€19.99/A$29.95) a year or £3.49 (US$3.99/€3.99/A$5.95) a month, but is free until 31 March.', 'The console is launching with around 25 games, though many of these are enhanced versions of older Switch titles. The big newcomers are Mario Kart World, an open-world take on the classic karting game; the introductory game Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour; the co-op survival challenge Survival Kids and anti-gravity racer, Fast Fusion. Some favourites making it across are Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom. Most games will retail for between £45–£70 and will be available to buy and download online, or as physical boxed copies. You can also still play almost all your old Switch games on the new console, and there’s a huge back catalogue of retro NES, Nintendo 64, SNES and GameCube classics from the 1980s, 90s and 00s available to play with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.', 'There are three things you may want to buy alongside the console. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller is a traditional console joypad intended for serious play. Then you have the Nintendo Switch 2 camera, basically a webcam compatible with the GameChat service, but also with any games that might use camera features. You may also want a microSD Express card to provide additional storage for your games.', 'If you haven’t pre-ordered, you may have to be patient and shop around. Some of the larger retailers including Amazon, Argos, Currys and John Lewis are saying they may have a few in stock today and it’s worth trying Nintendo’s online store. Be extremely wary of buying from private sellers on eBay or similar sites – there will be a lot of con artists out there. Remember when people found their PlayStation 5 deliveries were instead full of bags of rice?']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

When you insert the card into the Switch console for the first time, it downloads the actual game to the card from an external server. After that initial download, you no longer need an Internet connection to play it. It\'s an offbeat idea, and we\'ve got all the details here.', 'The new Joy-Con 2 controllers look similar to the first version, but now attach to the console and other accessories magnetically, for a secure fit. They also feature mouse controls, meaning you can slide them across a flat surface for cursor-moving input, as well as a new dedicated button that activates voice chat features.', ""As for games, you can guarantee that Nintendo is going to have can't-miss first-party titles available at launch. We ran down our top 5 Switch 2 launch titles, including Switch 2 upgrades for both of the exceptional open-world Legend of Zelda games, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which will feature faster load times, better graphics and Switch App integration. The bundled Mario Kart World is also a spectacular next step in the storied racing franchise, and a new Bravely Default RPG will eat up all your free time."", 'The system itself promises ""significantly improved CPU and GPU performance"" according to Nintendo, along with USB-C ports on both sides so that you can charge the console while you play, as well as video output up to 4K and 120FPS, video chatting, and a GameShare feature that lets you play online with people who don\'t own the game you bought.

We've finally got the Switch 2—now what?,https://www.avclub.com/game-theory-nintendo-switch-2-initial-impressions,"['Every Friday, A.V. Club staffers kick off the weekend by taking a look at the world of gaming, diving in to the ideas that underpin the hobby we love with a bit of Game Theory. We’ll sound off in the space above, and invite you to respond down in the comments, telling us what you’re playing this weekend, and what theories it’s got you kicking around.', 'At the time of writing this, I’ve had my Switch 2—a press unit sent by Nintendo, it’s worth noting—for almost exactly 24 hours. In that day of futzing around with my new toy, I can easily say that the best games I’ve played on it were The Binding Of Isaac, a game I’ve already logged literally 2,000 hours with, and a mouse-based minigame buried a couple of menus down in the Bravely Default remaster. This feels at least mildly inauspicious.', '', '“But what of Mario Kart?” the people cry out, and, yes, Mario Kart World is a very good Mario Kart game: The new courses are genuinely gorgeous—I giggled like an idiot the first time I realized the gimmick of DK Spaceport, which turns the original Donkey Kong into a switchback-heavy race track—the open world mechanics are intriguing (if a bit thin), and the battle royale-esque Knockout Tour mode is a thrilling, unpredictable distillation of the franchise’s automotive chaos. But it is still Mario Kart: It’ll kill in multiplayer, and it’s easy to throw on when you want to get a few quick rounds in. But, like the Switch 2 itself, the new game feels like a very safe iteration on what’s worked in the past—notably, the supported-for-a-literal-decade Mario Kart 8—rather than something thrilling and new.', 'The other game Nintendo sent me, Welcome Tour, is mostly just an oddity—because who doesn’t love cracking open a new toy and then coughing up $10 to tackle a series of quizzes and tech demos about it? There’s neat stuff in the package, which lets you run around atop and inside a Switch 2, familiarizing yourself with its buttons and features. (Anything that shows off the new Joy-Cons’ rumble technology is genuinely impressive; there’s an early maraca-shaking demo that pulls off an amazingly effective brain trick.) Mostly, though, it feels like a way to shame me into buying a new TV that’s technologically worthy of the console: There’s nothing like rolling up to an in-game demo kiosk only to be told that the 15-year-old flatscreen I bought secondhand off a guy up in the Portland hills doesn’t have the juice to process a glorified screensaver.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.', '', 'Sign Up', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Paste Media Group.

How Nintendo dodged Trump’s tariffs and saved the Switch 2 release,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/05/nintendo-trump-tariffs-switch-2,"['Fortunate timing and government hesitation allowed the Switch 2 to come out on time, but the headache isn’t over', 'N\nintendo fans across the US are breathing a sigh of relief as they tear apart the boxes housing their new Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles. On-again, off-again trade tariffs implemented by Donald Trump, which precipitated pre-order delays from Nintendo, made the 5 June release date of the highly coveted hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to fruition.', 'Nintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely within a 90-day tariff pause issued by the president. If tariffs on countries such as India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “liberation day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.', 'It’s possible that a Switch 2 bought during the holiday season will cost more than it did at launch date. Nintendo’s top gaming hardware competitors – and essentially anyone shipping electronics to the US – have been watching the Switch 2 saga with bated breath.', '“What saved Nintendo in this case was that Trump chickened out,” Notre Dame professor and international economist Robert Johnson said.', 'Since its launch in March 2017, the Switch has become one of the best-selling video game consoles in history, with more than 150m units sold worldwide. Nintendo teased its successor in January and gave a full reveal during an 2 April live stream, announcing the device would ship on 5 June with a hefty $450 price tag in the US (or $500 when bundled with Mario Kart World). Just hours later, Trump stepped up to a podium at the Rose Garden, chart in tow, to announce a new volley of tariffs on imports on countries with a trade deficit with the US.', 'Among them: a 24% tariff on Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered, and a 46% tariff on Vietnam, where the bulk of its Switch manufacturing takes place. Stock markets plummeted as Nintendo fans collectively wondered whether the company would pass the costs of those steep duties on to them.', 'US pre-orders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin later that week on 9 April. Nintendo delayed that date so it could “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions”. The 5 June release date, the company noted, would stay the same. Gamers flocked to various social media sites to vent their frustration – much of it directed not at Nintendo, but at the Trump administration. Pre-orders resumed on 24 April and, predictably, the console quickly sold out.', 'Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment', 'Johnson notes that Nintendo, like many other consumer electronics makers, has spent years grappling with the question of where to produce.', 'In 2019, during the tail end of the first Trump administration, the gaming company began shifting production of the Switch from China to Vietnam in an effort to sidestep US tariffs on Chinese imports. Nintendo still manufactures some Switch products in China, but those units are typically shipped to non-US markets. Other major consumer tech companies, such as Apple, have similarly moved parts of their manufacturing operations from China to countries such as India to mitigate tariff impacts.', 'That strategy was ultimately rendered moot when the current administration announced a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, an unexpected move that Johnson says “caught virtually everyone off-guard”. These looming tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding them, could affect the pricing dynamics of nearly any consumer tech product entering the US.', 'Sony and Microsoft, both expected to release new consoles in 2027, will likely face similar challenges as Nintendo.', '“It takes a long time and significant capital outlays to bring new production facilities online. Producers really like to operate in a stable environment.” Johnson said. “The current trade environment is the exact opposite of that.”', 'The “liberation day” tariffs could easily have led to a higher Switch 2 price or a delayed release. But Nintendo managed to avoid that fate thanks to backpedaling by the Trump administration, a behavior described by the Financial Times using the acronym “taco” – short for “Trump always chickens out”. Trump’s call for a 90-day pause on tariffs to allow negotiations with targeted countries meant the Switch 2 could still be released during a window in which the import taxes wouldn’t apply.', 'And even if negotiations with Vietnam ultimately fail, reports estimate Nintendo has already shipped around 746,000 Switch 2 units to the US, which would not be subject to the higher tariffs.', 'Nintendo consumers will not walk away unscathed by tariffs. The company has said accessories for its device, a major part of the Switch’s dual form factor, will “experience price adjustments”. So far, according to CNBC, docks used to play the Switch on a full-size screen will cost $10 more than before, while straps for the two controllers will see a $1 increase. Johnson also said he wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo considers raising the console’s price around the holiday season, especially if Trump moves forward with a 46% tariff on Vietnam.', '“I find it difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will want thousands of stories written during the holiday season about how Trump ruined Christmas,” Johnson said. “So I expect they’ll find a way to climb down, but – like everyone else – I’m not sure about that.”', 'But there’s another reason why Nintendo may have an incentive to keep console prices from climbing too high: the majority of its revenue doesn’t come from physical console sales. Increasingly, the real moneymakers – for Nintendo and its competitors – are software and online subscriptions, neither of which are subject to tariffs.', '“In the end, Nintendo wants to sell consoles to get people to buy games and accessories,” Johnson said. “As a result, it may be willing to hold down the price of consoles.”']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

We've long known what the Switch 2 will look like, and when it'll arrive. We've told you how tariffs have affected Nintendo's launch plans, we've given you a step-by-step guide to pre-ordering and told you where to buy a Switch 2 on launch day. We gave you our first hands-on preview back in early April, told you how good of a first impression Mario Kart World makes and dug even deeper with our final preview earlier this week."", ""All that's left now is our full review, and reviews take time. While we put Nintendo's latest through its paces, you can catch up on everything you need to know about the Switch 2 below. If you want to follow the Engadget team's experiences with it on launch day, you can check out our Nintendo Switch 2 launch day live blog."", 'The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 1080p 7.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh and HDR compatibility. It also supports up to 4K output at 120Hz (with variable refresh rates) when docked.', ""The new Joy-Con 2 for Nintendo Switch 2 attaches magnetically with a button to release them. They have larger SL and SR buttons (the ones hidden when the Joy-Con are attached) to make playing multiplayer games on individual Joy-Cons more feasible. These buttons are also made of steel and attach to the Switch 2's magnets."", 'The analog sticks are no longer tiny nubs, and are closer in size to the ones you might find on a PS5 or Xbox controller. However, they do not have Hall effect sensors, the use of which can minimize the risk of the ""stick drift"" issue that plagued the original Joy-Cons.', 'The Joy-Con 2 have what Nintendo is calling “HD Rumble 2” built in, which seems to be a refinement of the original (and still very good) vibration function. Finally, each Joy-Con 2 has an optical sensor that allows you to use it as a mouse, and a C button, which we’ll get to in a minute.', 'The new Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with everything you’d expect based on the refreshed Joy-Con 2: Namely HD Rumble 2 and the C button. There are also remappable GL/GR buttons around the back and a standard audio jack for connecting a headset.', 'Both options come with Amiibo support built in. The Switch 2 comes with two Joy-Con 2, as you’d expect, and additional pairs are priced at $95. The Pro Controller will cost $85.', 'The new C button is a dedicated way to enter a chat session with friends. As well as the standard features you’d expect from voice chat, Nintendo has built a Discord-like video-sharing feature, which lets you show your gameplay to others and see other people’s screens while you’re playing.', 'The GameChat function works with a mic built into the console, though headsets are also supported. Nintendo will also sell a $55 camera that plugs into the USB-C port on the top of the console, which will allow you to stream your face along with your game.', 'The Switch 2 will work with GameCube games via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The three titles available at launch will be F-Zero GX, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur II.', 'Perhaps the biggest feature, though, is one you can’t see: The Switch 2 has an all-new processor and GPU and significantly more storage (256GB vs 64GB in the Switch OLED), along with support for faster and more capacious microSD cards. This will obviously lead to better first-party games and upgraded Switch experiences, but more importantly it will mean multi-platform games that had to skip the original, underpowered Switch will be able to be ported over. With games like Cyberpunk 2077 coming to the Switch 2 at launch, it seems like far more ports will be feasible than on the original console.', ""Digital Foundry has been able to confirm a bunch of the details of the Switch 2's specs that Nintendo hasn't explained publicly, but the highlights are the consoles custom chip and faster storage. The Switch 2 uses a NVIDIA chip with eight ARM Cortex A78C cores, six of which are available to developers, and a GPU with the company's Ampere architecture. That's alongside 12GB of LPDDRX RAM and a custom FDE (file decompression engine) that decompresses game files without drawing power from the Switch 2's CPU."", ""Another major improvement comes in the form of networking — the Switch 2 supports Wi-Fi 6, which will improve the original's often glacial download speeds. Similarly, the new dock sports an Ethernet port for a rock-solid connection."", 'Virtual Game Cards are Nintendo’s way of making digital games replicate the experience of physical copies. They let you lend digital games to friends and family, letting them enjoy the game on their system without buying a separate copy.', 'Of course, there are caveats. Much like a physical cartridge, only one system can play each Virtual Game Card at a time. You can only loan games to up to eight people, and each will need to be on the same Nintendo Family Account and local network. Finally, you can only share one game at a time, and the lending period lasts only two weeks. Although that’s a healthy list of limitations, the feature is still more than other consoles have offered — and, if we’re lucky, it will be something Sony and Microsoft are pressured to adopt.', 'Perhaps best of all, the feature isn’t exclusive to the Switch 2. It’s already available for the first Switch.', 'Game-Key cards are physical Switch 2 games that only contain a portion of their game data. The first time you slot one in, your Switch 2 will download the rest of the game to your local storage and the Game-Key card becomes the ""key"" you need to use anytime you want to play it.', ""Nintendo says you'll have to have an internet connection the first time you boot up the game, but afterwards the card itself should be enough to let you play. You'll also be able to resell your Game-Key card in the same way you would a normal cartridge or disc."", ""This fusion of digital and physical has become fairly common on other consoles as the size of games has grown larger, but it's relatively novel for Nintendo. Since the Switch 2 is going to be running more demanding, high-fidelity games, though, it's a compromise that lets people still enjoy the common-sense benefits of physical game cards."", ""Nintendo gave the press a chance to check out the Switch 2 and a few of the games it highlighted. You can read our impressions of Mario Kart World as well as more general thoughts on how the Switch 2 feels in person. Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like an outstanding launch title, with more depth and better visuals than we've ever seen from a Mario Kart game. The core formula is intact, but there are a lot of new features and play styles to dig into."", 'As for the Switch 2 hardware, it feels like a major step forward from the original Switch — it has grown up a lot and feels far more polished and refined. And while it may not have an OLED screen, the 7.9-inch LED display Nintendo did use is outstanding.', ""Nintendo scheduled its launch for June 5, 2025. From a US perspective, the first consoles reached gamers' hands on June 4, with Australians and New Zealanders sharing images online and some streaming their experiences on Twitch and YouTube."", 'Switch 2 pre-orders were initially set to begin on April 9, but the following week, Nintendo said it was suspending pre-order plans in the US ""indefinitely"" in reaction to a slate of tariffs imposed by President Trump.', 'Finally, when pre-orders opened on April 24, a hot mess ensued. Those who stayed up late trying to snag a Switch 2 were often left empty-handed as Walmart, Best Buy and Target’s websites weren’t fully equipped for the demand. Many customers were left with unmoving queues and error messages — a familiar process for many who’ve tried to pre-order a hot gaming or tech product in recent years. (Folks who pre-ordered a PS5 during the pandemic caught the nastiest case of deja vu.)', 'No retailers are currently taking Switch 2 pre-orders. Although there’s always the chance one will drop an unexpected stock refresh, your best option right now is to register your interest with Nintendo. That may not lead to a launch-day console, as Nintendo has warned, but it won’t likely be a crazy delay like those familiar to GPU buyers. And if your Nintendo cred ticks the right boxes (you have been subscribed to Switch Online for at least 12 months, have opted in to share gameplay data, and have at least 50 total gameplay hours), your odds will improve.', 'Costco is a dark-horse candidate for day-one availability. The retailer doesn’t appear to have taken any Switch 2 pre-orders, but a product listing claims it will have Mario Kart World console bundles in stock on launch day.', 'In any case, Nintendo says the console’s June 5 release date is unchanged.', 'In a somewhat disappointing update, Nintendo appears to be shipping ""sold out"" signs to retailers so that they can quickly let people know the Switch 2 isn\'t in stock. We can only read so much into that, but it seems likely that if you can\'t grab one on launch day from a retailer, you\'ll be waiting a while for them to come back in stock.', 'On April 2, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $450 standalone, or $500 with a bundled digital copy of the new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World. That’s significantly more expensive than the original Switch, which launched at $300, and has remained at that price ever since. It’s also more expensive than the entry-level current-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft.', 'The comparison looks a little better up against Valve’s Steam Deck, which costs $400 for the LCD model or $550 for the basic OLED model. The Steam Deck is more affordable than most PC handhelds.', 'When Nintendo delayed the pre-orders from the original date of April 9, it said it was doing so ""in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions."" With heavy US tariffs levied on Nintendo\'s Asian production centers, the implication was that would have little choice but to pass at least some of those costs on to American consumers. But Trump\'s April 9 tariff pivot — reverting to 10 percent across the board for 90 days for all countries except China, which now gets a triple-digit hit — further muddied the waters. That\'s because it\'s unclear how much, if any, of the components and assembly of US-bound Switch 2 consoles will originate in China.', ""The administration exempted some electronics from reciprocal tariffs, but they'll soon be subject to new levies on semiconductors. Some analysts suggest that Nintendo will be selling consoles at a loss in the US with even a 10 percent tariff."", 'Nevertheless, the company is keeping the price of the Switch 2 at $450 and the Mario Kart World bundle at $500. However, it noted that it had to increase the prices of Switch 2 accessories ""due to changing market conditions"" and added that other price modifications may occur in the future for a similar reason.', ""When Nintendo announced the rescheduled Switch 2 pre-order date for the US and Canada, it confirmed price increases for many of the console's accessories. The current US prices for the accessories are as follows:"", 'Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller — $85', 'Joy-Con 2 Pair — $95', 'Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip — $40', 'Joy-Con 2 Strap — $14', 'Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set — $25', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Camera — $55', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set — $120', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector — $40', 'Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case — $85', 'Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter — $35', 'Samsung microSD Express Card – 256GB for Nintendo Switch 2 — $60', 'The price of the Joy-Con 2 strap has gone up by $1, but the prices of other products have risen by between $5 and $10, with the dock set getting the larger increase. Thankfully, your Nintendo Switch 2 will come with a dock. Nintendo also released a list of accessory prices for Canada.', 'Nintendo says that the Switch 2 will last between 2 and 6.5 hours on a single charge. This is similar to the original Switch, which was rated for 2.5-6.5 hours, though later revisions upped that figure significantly. The company cautions that ""this time is an estimate ... battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions.""', 'Based on video Nintendo shared in the Nintendo Today app, one way the Switch 2 will extend the longevity of its battery over time is with a new ""battery preservation mode."" When enabled, your Switch 2 will stop charging when it reaches 90 percent, saving its battery from the wear and tear of charging to 100 percent every time. This is a fairly common feature on smartphones, and it makes sense for a handheld console you charge every day.', ""A new battery mode won't change the Switch 2's estimated battery life, but it will slow the damage charging the console has, which keeps it usable for longer."", 'Nintendo confirmed in November 2024 that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible. It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles.', 'In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that ""certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."" We now have more information on which games are working thanks to a guide Nintendo put together.', 'As of April 1, the vast majority of Switch 2 games are marked as compatible, but many popular games are said to have some issues. Nintendo has marked most of these as “under investigation,” suggesting a fix may be on the way in time for launch. Nintendo says it is manually testing every Switch game for compatibility.', 'Only one title is marked as incompatible: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This was part of Nintendo’s Labo range of games that worked with Cardboard accessories, and is incompatible as the Switch 2 doesn’t physically fit in the VR headset.', ""The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run some of the late-generation software that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? That’s unclear. In an “Ask the Developer” page on its site, Nintendo says that old games are working through a real-time translation system, which sounds similar to how Rosetta allows modern Macs to run old software. With that said, the new and old Switch are much closer in hardware than that."", 'In the same developer interview, it’s said that in its testing of old games for compatibility, there were some occasions “where loading times became faster, or game performance became more stable,” but we don’t have any detail beyond that.', 'As well as backward compatibility, Nintendo is also offering up premium ""Switch 2 Edition"" upgrades for a select few games. These have improved resolutions and frame rates, and (in some cases) bonus features and content. What exactly that means will vary, but Nintendo did confirm that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will have 4K/60 fps and 1080p/120 fps options on the Switch 2.', 'Games confirmed to have a Switch 2 Edition to date include:', 'Super Mario Party Jamboree', 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild', 'The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom', 'Kirby and the Forgotten Land', 'Pokémon Legends: Z-A', 'Metroid Prime 4: Beyond', 'In the case of the two mainline Zelda games, those upgrades will be included with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership or cost $10 each. Upgrades for the other games are also paid, but Nintendo has not said how much those will cost.', 'You may remember that the original Switch cartridges taste absolutely awful. This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth.', ""Similarly, the Switch 2 carts are also said to taste terrible, in large part to stop children or pets from accidentally ingesting them. It is not yet clear what substance Nintendo has coated the Switch 2 cartridges in to make them taste foul, but Nintendo's Takuhiro Dohta advised against licking them all the same."", '""We don\'t want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption,"" he told GameSpot.

"It’s official: There are no Nintendo Switch 2 reviews. Here’s what that means for us, and you",https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/opinion/its-official-there-are-no-nintendo-switch-2-reviews-heres-what-that-means-for-us-and-you/,"['NINTENDO’S DECISION NOT TO FACILITATE PRE-LAUNCH SWITCH 2 REVIEWS IS DISAPPOINTING NEWS FOR EVERYONE', 'It’s official: for the first time in more than 20 years, there will be no pre-release reviews for a new Nintendo console.', 'According to a company spokesperson, Nintendo decided not to send Switch 2 review units to press ahead of launch because “important features and updates” will only be available via a system update on the day of the console’s official release, on June 5.', 'It did not say what these updates entail, or explain why the media wasn’t offered the opportunity to review its launch games, like Mario Kart World and Switch 2 Welcome Tour, at in-person events instead, like it did with previous console launches such as Wii. Neither did it explain why critics can’t be trusted to cover products with knowledge that additional functionality will be patched later, as they’re frequently used to.', 'How and when game creators decide to distribute their review products is, of course, their prerogative, and the media has no right to early samples. Game coverage has also changed drastically over the past decade, with more priority given to post-release coverage of today’s increasingly complex video games.', 'But a lack of coverage at or before release is bad for you, our readers. When Switch 2 arrives, there will have been no reviews of its software, no analysis of its hardware performance or battery life, or any testing of its key features, such as Game Chat, or how backwards compatible Switch 1 games perform. No hidden gems will be unearthed, and no potential dodgy ports highlighted, before you have a chance of spending your hard-earned money.', 'And when reviews do arrive, well after launch day, many critics will have been incentivized to rush through their games as quickly as possible, with Google and social media rewarding speed over quality.', 'For Nintendo, this won’t matter. Its launch allocation of Switch 2 consoles will almost certainly sell out to early adopters, who are not as concerned with the critical consensus as they might have been in years past. Publications like VGC will continue to cover the console anyway, after Switch 2 goes on sale.', 'For the media, of course, it’s disappointing. It’s a tough time for all independent publications, which is why we’re increasingly calling for readers to support us via Patreon, and with both GTA 6 and pre-launch Switch 2 review coverage now off the table, 2025 just got a bit tougher for everybody.', 'It also means that, like other sites – including the very biggest – we’ll now need to juggle our Switch 2 review coverage with one of the biggest events of the year, Summer Game Fest, which takes place during this launch weekend, which Nintendo will have been well aware of.', 'But it’s not just the media that misses out: more than 20 Switch 2 launch games from third parties have now effectively been prevented from generating any day-one review coverage for their titles. Many publishers have reached out to sites like VGC asking for clarification around when the press would receive review units, and some even said they wished they’d chosen to release their games later, after it became clear they would not be able to secure authentic editorial coverage at all.', '“When Switch 2 releases, there will have been no reviews of its software, no analysis of its hardware performance or battery life, or any sort of testing of its key features like Game Chat.”', 'Perhaps it really was a technical nightmare for Nintendo to provide pre-launch review access to press – we’re already seeing, for example, that those who have somehow gained access to the console pre-launch, cannot use them at all until a future system update. And there’s certainly no precedent of Nintendo being adversarial with press reviews: in my experience, in fact, it’s historically been one of the most critic-friendly companies, often supplying software many weeks in advance.', 'And I don’t personally believe the decision to hold back reviews comes from a lack of confidence in its launch line-up either: my recent time playing Mario Kart World and Switch 2 Welcome Tour at Nintendo’s UK office was great fun and had me excited to spend more time with the games.', 'But consoles have launched with day one patches for over a decade, and the media are well used to covering unfinished products, so, in my opinion, this decision is more likely related to Nintendo’s paranoia around leaks as it is with any missing functionality before launch day – those leaked videos of early consoles that can’t run games certainly strengthen that hypothesis.', 'No matter how integral Nintendo believes patched-in features like (potentially) Game Chat are to the overall experience, it’s difficult to believe that it couldn’t have found a way for reviewers to experience them pre-release.', 'It’s undoubtedly a bad look, especially following a number of decisions that many fans have received negatively. Switch 2 arrives at a time when its maker has spearheaded an unprecedented $80 price point for games, the prevalence of Game Key Cards is annoying preservationists, and the company regularly declines to disclose who is actually making its games.', 'History tells us, a lack of transparency with the press isn’t good for consumers. Cyberpunk 2077’s shocking console launch, let’s not forget, was only allowed to happen through a similar withholding of review code, which led to a nasty surprise for many players.', 'On the flip side, when Bethesda briefly implemented its no-pre-release-reviews policy a decade ago, Doom, Prey, and Dishonored 2 missed out on a tremendous amount of positive coverage from critics, with their sales curves suggesting many players wanted to hear from reviews before deciding on a purchase (Bethesda later reversed the policy).', 'Nintendo has made its decision, and on VGC we will be covering Switch 2 and its launch games comprehensively, as quickly as we’re able to while maintaining our editorial standards. Summer Game Fest means our reviews may sadly come later than we hoped, but we want to make sure we spend time delivering the right coverage for our readers and Patreon supporters. In the meantime, if you have any views on how we should present our launch editorial, please do let us know in the comments and on Discord.', 'We sometimes publish affiliate links on VGC.

Visit our Patreon page to become a patron and get access to community discussions and other exclusive benefits.', 'An excellent opinion piece which is totally fair. Whilst I’m someone who pre ordered at the earliest opportunity there is a tiny part nagging away about early game or console issues which would be reported within games media. It’s interesting that you mention CP2077 as I also pre ordered it without much thought. Games journalism first and foremost (for me) has been a great way to inform purchases (especially in a time where we have less expendable income), so it’s never been more important to have reviews and thoughts about these products. I look forward to all of your thoughts and reviews as and when they come.', 'I’ve been generally pretty forgiving to Nintendo about a lot of Switch 2 related decisions because they generally at least make business sense, but I will be loud about this. Not allowing press early access to help consumers make informed decisions is unacceptable. I stopped preordering Microsoft products on the same principle, when they acquired Bethesda and announced those games would no longer be sent to the press ahead of time.', 'So…although it’s too late to do anything about my Switch 2 preorder, I will no longer be preordering Nintendo products going forward! I hope that’s the end result they wanted!', 'Just clarifying my original statement that Bethesda actually implemented their review policy BEFORE they were acquired by Microsoft, as is pointed out by the article. Time is weird and makes me forget the order of things!', 'This is more than fair, it is justified to bring this up. Game coverage is a job, and this decision by Nintendo makes that job objectively harder. Not even allowing access at a controlled pre-release event is to the detriment of everyone: the press, consumers and even Nintendo. The choice to also have it launching on the busiest news week for the gaming industry compounds this problem; now many Switch 2 launch games will have less and worsened coverage, as time is a finite resource.

Can Switch 2 break Nintendo's sequel curse? | Opinion,https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-switch-2-break-nintendos-sequel-curse-opinion,"['Follow-ups to massively successful Nintendo consoles usually flop – but with a strong launch and hints of months of supply constraints to come, Switch 2 seems set to break that streak', 'Midnight sales events, long queues, pre-orders sold out in minutes; the long-awaited arrival of the Switch 2 really has the atmosphere of great console launches of the past.', 'After the muted, pandemic-era launches of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, a big, high-profile hardware launch like this is a shot in the arm for the whole industry – a much-needed boost in an era of growing concern over how the next few years are going to shake out economically.', 'One factor that the Switch 2 launch does seem likely to have in common with the PS5 launch in particular, however, is supply constraints. Nintendo seems to have managed to get a solid amount of stock to retailers for the launch, but demand for the new system is very high and likely to remain well ahead of supply for quite a few months.', 'This mirrors the situation with the PS5, which left many consumers deeply frustrated and feeling like Sony was failing to supply the market adequately, even though in reality supply of the PS5 was higher than for any previous console launch. It also, of course, created enormous opportunities for scalpers, whose actions massively exacerbated the supply issues.', ""Nintendo has tried to avoid that in various ways – requiring an active Nintendo account with a history of usage to secure pre-orders, for example – but we'll have to wait and see how successful those efforts have been, or whether this will be another launch that turns into open season for scalpers."", ""The actual way to avoid scalpers turning up and ruining the fun, of course, is to get better at matching supply to demand – but that is, of course, far easier to say than to do. Forecasting demand for something like a console is tricky, and ramping up supply isn't as simple as turning a dial in the factory."", 'Often, hardware supply has to be managed in major step-changes. Increasing supply can mean retooling a whole production line, or even an entire factory, which is very costly and represents a huge risk if your demand forecasts turn out to have been too optimistic.', ""No company wants to get stuck with a large number of hardware units they can't sell, let alone with factory production lines that they don't need. In an ideal world they'd love to perfectly match supply to demand and sell every unit they can, but they'll always opt to take a hit from supply being constrained rather than risking over-supply."", ""Nintendo's target for Switch 2 for the fiscal year is 15 million units, which is a very solid number by the standards of console launches historically, but it's probably extremely conservative compared to the actual demand which exists for the device. This is a very unique console launch, after all. It's an anomaly for Nintendo itself – a clear, direct sequel device to the prior console, maintaining essentially the same form factor and functionality, has not been part of Nintendo's modus operandi for decades."", ""The original Switch has sold over 150 million units, making it comfortably one of the most successful pieces of gaming hardware in history, and remains a tremendously popular and well-loved device – but after eight years on the market, it's clearly long in the tooth and most consumers won't need much convincing that an upgrade is timely."", ""That creates a huge groundswell of demand for the new console. There's nothing complicated to explain here: it's simply a new, better, faster version of a console that people already really like, but which even non-technical audiences who don't know one end of a Digital Foundry video from the other can see is pretty underpowered by modern standards."", ""The handheld nature of Switch will also help to make the upgrade more tempting for many consumers, since it's the easiest possible console to upgrade and pass down to younger siblings, children, nephews / nieces etc. when you upgrade, as distinct from fixed home consoles that also need to be attached to a TV."", ""Looked at from this perspective, the 15 million target for the Switch 2 this year really does start to look conservative. It may be a good number for a games console generally, but it's less than 10% of the units sold by its predecessor, and it's not unreasonable to posit that the potential audience size for the new device is not dissimilar to the previous one."", ""That mismatch almost certainly guarantees major supply constraints for months to come, especially as the software library for the new console grows and major new titles are announced (although it's clear that a lot of consumers will also buy the console just to play their existing Switch library on better hardware)."", ""You can't entirely blame Nintendo for being very cautious about how they approach the risk profile for the Switch 2's supply, however. The whole console is essentially an attempt by the company to overcome its long-running curse, after all: time and time again, successful Nintendo consoles are followed by flops."", 'Switch 2 looks likely to break that curse, simply by not departing from the winning formula of the previous device.', 'Still, success is never guaranteed, and with additional economic risks such as tariffs, the weakness of the Yen, and some recession indicators all floating around the console launch and giving executives in Kyoto sleepless nights, nobody should be surprised that Nintendo has sought to minimise risk in every possible way for this launch, including sticking to a fairly conservative supply target.', 'Nevertheless, the strong early response to the console and the prospect of a 15 million installed base by the end of the financial year will make Switch 2 into a major new addition to the industry landscape, and a tempting prospect for developers and publishers even in the early stages of its lifespan. It will be interesting to see if the system follows in the footsteps of its predecessor and has a bit of a golden age for smaller and independent titles in its first few years.', 'That era eventually ended on the Switch as the eShop became swamped with low-quality shovelware that Nintendo seemingly had no inclination to control or manage, but as new buyers of Switch 2 seek out interesting new software for their console in a relatively uncluttered market, it should create new opportunities for developers – and perhaps this time around Nintendo will make more of an effort at quality control and try to maintain that market in the long term.', ""For now, the console that's arguably had the longest gestation period of any device in the industry's history is finally in the hands of at least a few lucky consumers, and the early word of mouth is largely positive."", ""It's too early to proclaim Nintendo's curse to be broken, but all the signs so far are good – and a healthy launch for the Switch 2 is good news not just for Nintendo, but for the industry at large."", 'All the biggest stories, expert analysis and data, straight to your inbox.', ""© 2025 GamesIndustry.biz, an IGN Entertainment Inc. brand. 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

People could play the game on their TV, then attach the controllers to the console’s display and take it with them.', 'Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said in April that 2.2 million people in Japan had entered the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 on launch day.', 'Furukawa said it was “beyond” Nintendo’s expectations and is more than the company will be able to deliver to stores on Thursday.', 'The shortages in Japan are expected to persist.', '“Demand in Japan for Switch 2 is sky high actually, perhaps higher than anywhere else,” Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based games consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC.', '“You cannot walk into a store anywhere in Japan to pick up a Switch 2 without a pre-order, and this will not change over the next weeks and months.”', 'In China, major online retailer JD.com said it had received 400,000 reservations for the console which began shipping on Thursday. Not everyone who reserves a console will end up purchasing one.', 'In the U.S., Best Buy\nopened some stores across the country at midnight on Thursday (or late Wednesday depending on the time zone) for in-store purchases. Walmart\nsaid it was opening orders at midnight ET online as well as in store at Supercenters at 6 a.m. ET. Walmart’s website currently shows the console as sold out.', 'Doug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, told CNBC on Wednesday that the company has been working with “retail partners to ensure there’s ample supply for not only the launch weekend, but well beyond.”', 'In the U.K., there appears to be more availability. Amazon\n’s U.K. page shows the Switch 2 available for delivery on Friday. Other retailers, like Currys and toy store Smyths, also appear to have it in stock.', '“Given the pent-up demand, a launch day sell-outs were inevitable. However, we believe Nintendo is well prepared and expect supply to stabilize in the weeks that follow,” Omdia’s Jijiashvili said.', 'Last month, Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million units of the Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. However, analysts have said that is conservative.', 'Kantan Games’ Toto said he is forecasting sales of 20 million units in the first year. Omdia said it is expecting sales of 14.4 million Switch 2 consoles in 2025 alone, which would be ahead of the original Switch’s debut year.', 'Like most electronics players, Nintendo is keeping an eye on the tariff situation. Nintendo delayed preorders for the Switch 2 in April after U.S. President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” on most countries around the world.', 'The Switch 2 retails for $449 in the U.S., making it Nintendo’s most expensive console to date.', 'Nintendo’s Bowser said the company was going to “monitor where tariffs are going” before making any further decisions on whether to raise the price. He said consumers should expect to pay the current price for the Switch 2 but did not rule out any future hikes.', '“The price that you see right now is the price that you can be expecting in the future.

The confirmation that the US tariffs won\'t be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers\' exasperation a bit, but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We\'re eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they\'re finally getting their hands on the new console and games.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

,https://www.wired.com/story/switch-2-scalpers/,"['NINTENDO’S SWITCH 2 launch is underway worldwide. The console officially releases June 5, meaning buyers in territories in earlier time zones have already gotten their hands on it. As midnight rolls across North America, players here will do the same. Many fans preordered their Switch 2, allowing them to skip the in-person lines planned for midnight sales at retail stores. Others are currently bidding on consoles being sold by scalpers.', 'Sellers on sites like eBay and Mercari have created their own ecosystem of preorder sales, capitalizing on fears that the ongoing tariff drama and possible stock shortages will make the Switch 2 scarce. The console, which retails at $450, is selling for several hundred dollars more on the resale sites. One listing, which promises to ship June 6, is selling for $849 or “best offer.” Other listings are actively being bid on. On Mercari, consoles are selling in the $600 range and above.', 'There are good reasons for people to be anxious. Nintendo has a history of supply shortages, including with the Switch 2’s predecessor; in Japan, the company has already warned customers that demand may exceed supply. Nintendo prepared for the possibility of scalping ahead of the game console’s preorder period; buyers who wanted a unit directly from their stores could only purchase one system per account and had to meet specific requirements, including 50 hours of playtime on their Switch account.', 'Buyers who wanted to snatch more than one Switch could still place multiple orders through other retailers, like Amazon or Walmart. According to online message boards, some did; others confessed to buying from scalpers after failing to find their own. “I have no shame,” wrote a user on the GameFaqs forum. “Roughly 700.00 [USD]. Including priority air next day shipping … no Mario Kart bundle. I couldn’t wait any longer.”', 'Reached by WIRED, Nintendo would not immediately comment. Earlier this month, the company announced that it would be working with Mercari, Yahoo Auctions, Yahoo Fleamarket, and Rakuten Rakuma to remove listings and ban users—but only in Japan. Crackdowns on the resale sites will begin June 5 as part of a probationary period. It’s unclear if these measures will be implemented in other regions.', 'The global market may also yet have a part to play. Nintendo made the unprecedented move of temporarily delaying preorders after the console’s in-person unveiling, following extreme tariff announcements made by President Donald Trump. Although the price of the console itself hasn’t been impacted—for now—many accessories are now more expensive than previously announced. As even older game consoles grow more expensive, it’s not impossible that the Switch 2’s price will increase after launch.', 'Still, buyers turning to secondhand sellers may be left Switchless after all, due to preorder delays and cancellations.

Nintendo Switch 2 Review in Progress,https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review,"['Over the last eight years, the Nintendo Switch has become one of the most successful and influential consoles of all time – so it’s incredibly exciting that the Nintendo Switch 2 is magnetically snapping into our hands at long last. While I only got my Switch 2 at its global launch yesterday, I spent the entire day playing Mario Kart World, exploring Welcome Tour, revisiting updated games, and trying out its fancy new mouse controls in Cyberpunk 2077. While I have a lot more to test before my final review, including spending some quality time gaming on the go, I’ve already got a good initial sense of what has (and hasn’t) impressed me so far.', '', 'Let’s start simple: The Switch 2 is bigger and better looking than its predecessor. Even compared to my trusty old OLED Switch, the new screen looks great, and the extra real estate is a noticeable improvement. I haven’t played a ton in handheld mode just yet, but whether I am playing docked or holding it in my own two hands, the higher framerate and resolution just make everything crisp and clean, especially when viewed side by side. None of that is breaking new ground in gaming overall, sure (the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X brought 4K gaming to consoles in 2016 and 2017, respectively) but it’s part of a handful of moments I’ve had where it fully hit me just how dated the original Switch was getting. So while it may not be giving the PS5 Pro a run for its money or anything, the Switch 2 does at least feel distinctly modern again.', 'The physical device is also just a little bit sleeker and more reliable to use all around. The new kickstand is excellent, comparable to a slimmer version of the OLED’s when it comes to both its wide range of possible angles and the way it “sticks” where you want it – and both it and the OLED put the original Switch kickstand to absolute shame if that’s all you’ve used. (You can finally charge while using the kickstand, too, thanks to a second USB-C port on the top of the system.) The new dock is easy to plop into and yank out of quickly, especially since the new magnetic attachments of the Joy-Con 2 controllers mean you can easily attach and pull them off the system with one hand apiece instead of one at a time.', 'Speaking of those magnets, I asked folk what their burning questions about the Switch 2 might be ahead of this review, and one of the most common questions was about this new attachment system. My initial reaction is that it works super well, and any shortcomings seem to be made up for by new conveniences. It’s easy to take them off the system in a flash when you want to, but at the same time they don’t feel like they would ever slip off by accident. The magnets aren’t strong enough to stop you from pulling a Joy-Con off without the release button if you really want to, but you’d have to be actively trying to do that.', 'Mario Kart World Review in Progress', 'Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review', 'Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Review Update', 'Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 Review Update', 'More to come!', 'That’s not the only trick these updated controllers have up their wrist straps, with the big new interactivity feature of the Switch 2 being the ability to use a Joy-Con as a mouse. Turn it on its side and your shoulder buttons become mouse buttons, theoretically ready for first-person shooters like Cyberpunk 2077 and strategy games like Civilization 7 alike. This idea has the potential to be a massive game changer, allowing for a more PC-like experience on the couch… but my experience using it so far has made me a little skeptical about how often I will choose to do so if gamepad controls can get the job done.', 'The problems with mouse control are not quite what I expected them to be. The responsiveness and precision of the Joy-Con mouse is actually very impressive to me – it’s not going to rival a high-quality PC gaming setup, so don’t expect any esports to make the jump to Switch 2-based live events, but it’s more than enough for your average player. As someone who primarily games on either PC or Switch, I felt like the aim I could get during firefights in Cyberpunk 2077 was far and away the best when using mouse controllers instead of a traditional joystick setup, or even motion-based assisted aiming. It really does work, and that absolutely rules.', 'It’s also more comfortable to use on my couch cushion while lazying around in a comfy position than I expected. I have a fairly flat couch, so maybe your mileage will vary, but it’s far from the nightmare scenario I was expecting of having to sit upright with my mouse hand on the coffee table in front of me to function. Even using it on your thigh (as Nintendo strangely recommends) is surprisingly workable, though I would only ever want to do that for quick menu selections or the like, not gunfights or more careful tasks. I am going to try it on a variety of surfaces such as flat books and the like to test out makeshift mousepads on my couch (something that has long eluded PC gaming peripheral makers hoping they will be the one to finally bring the mouse and keyboard to the living room), but once again, this does work pretty much as I’d hoped, which is great to discover.', 'No, the reason I might not look to play my mouse-based games while reclining on the couch going forward is much simpler, much more obvious: the Joy-Con is just not a comfortable mouse. Mice are shaped the way they are for a good reason, supporting your hand in specific spots and reducing strain wherever they can. In contrast, the Joy-Con 2 is a candy bar with triggers, and finding a comfortable way to hold it steady while having both movement precision and access to all the buttons you’ll need is tricky. It’s doable, and in shorter bursts I would honestly still prefer to play Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 this way compared to any other option – but after a two-hour play session yesterday, I am genuinely still feeling the strain in my hand and forearm today.', 'The other issue here I didn’t previously consider is that the introduction of a competent mouse does not mean an easy solution for the lack of a keyboard. Without extra buttons on the left Joy-Con to compensate, you still need to be able to hit all the buttons on the right Joy-Con as you’re swiping it around. I am used to using extra mouse buttons while gaming (my current PC mouse has three that I map to other actions), so that’s not new – but when I’m already using my thumb to find some semblance of a good grip, asking me to remove it in order to press the A button to dodge or (God forbid) push in the right stick to crouch is pretty tricky. The positions of those buttons simply weren’t arranged with this application in mind.', 'Again, the mouse controls have still been pretty dang useful in short bursts or for games without as many complex interactions to manage (I still need to test out Civilization 7, which I’m hoping will be more contained to pointing and clicking). But it’s hard to imagine sitting down with Borderlands 4 later this year, for example, and playing an entire FPS campaign like this, which is a shame. That said, if Nintendo were to make an official wireless Mouse-Con or snap-on accessory with all the buttons that are needed and a physical shape that wouldn’t hurt my hand to hold I would pick it up in a heartbeat, so the potential for this control method to be truly great is here.', 'Certain games even allow you to plug in a USB mouse and use it as you would on PC, but that doesn’t appear to be supported in the Switch 2 menus and comes with its own limitations. For example, I was impressed to discover that Cyberpunk 2077 even has full mouse and keyboard support on Switch 2, working exactly as you’d hope as soon as I plugged them into the USB ports on the dock. But you can’t just use the mouse to replace the right Joy-Con and still use the left for movement without the UI swapping rapidly between the two input methods, and you can’t rebind any of the buttons on the mouse to replace the buttons you’ve lost, so it’s not really a full-time solution. It’s all mouse and keyboard or all Joy-Con.', 'Another common question I got was about backwards compatibility and how Switch 1 games without explicit upgrade editions look on this more powerful system. We still need to do a lot of proper testing, so this is anecdotal at the moment, but I did hop into The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and didn’t see a hint of the framerate inconsistencies it often had when I reviewed it on the OLED Switch. That’s encouraging at the very least, and hopefully a sign of how other games with histories of rocky performance will fare as well.', 'The other big question mark blocks waiting to be punched for answers are things like battery life, handheld performance, and heat – on that last point, I will say that it hasn’t gotten hot in my hands so far, but when I was playing Welcome Tour in 4K while docked, every time I had to pick it up for a handheld tech demo or minigame the system was shockingly warm. It wasn’t hot enough to burn me or anything, but it seems like the fan and other cooling tech Welcome Tour tells me is in the dock is truly non-optional. That will certainly complicate third-party dock options going forward.', 'I’ve got a lot more to play, do, and see with the Switch 2 before my final, scored review. So far this sequel system is about what I was expecting: An iterative upgrade to an already excellent Nintendo console that modernizes many desperately out of date aspects, improves countless design elements in small but noticeable ways, and takes a swing on a genuinely impressive new control option that also doesn’t quite work as smoothly as I’d hoped. But if reading this has raised any more questions about the Switch 2 you’d like to see addressed, leave them in the comments below and I (or one of the other IGN folks currently getting familiar with it) will try to answer it in our coverage.', 'If you’re wondering why I am the one reviewing the Switch 2 for IGN, let me fill you in. My name is Tom, and I’m the Executive Reviews Editor for games at IGN. I’ve been here for eight years next month and have reviewed quite a few Nintendo games in that time, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I also served a stint as a regular on our Nintendo Voice Chat podcast. The keen-eyed among you may also notice that this isn’t the first time I’ve reviewed a Switch, either: I did both our 2018 updated review of the base Switch, taking a look at the system after a year of regular use, as well as our review of the pocket-sized Switch Lite in 2019.', 'After all of that, I’m extremely familiar with Nintendo’s original hybrid system, and while I truly love that console, I’m also very aware of its shortcomings, from performance woes to joystick drift. Because the Switch 2 feels like more of an iterative successor that doesn’t set out to flip the table on what Nintendo was already doing, I am going to be taking an eye toward those longstanding issues and how well they have been addressed (although, for something like drift, we likely won’t have a clear answer for many months to come).', 'Alongside the system review and reviews of the two all-new launch games, Welcome Tour and Mario Kart World, we’re also planning check-ins on major games that are getting Switch 2 revisions. That includes Cyberpunk 2077, Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, and Civilization 7, as well as games with less flashy updates like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. And, of course, you can look out for my final review of the system itself in the next week or two!', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

‘SWITCH 2’ IS NINTENDO (MOSTLY) ALL GROWN UP,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-review-1235350688/,"['By CHRISTOPHER CRUZ', 'After an eight-year gaming journey encompassing the longest console cycle Nintendo’s ever had, it’s finally time to turn the page with the launch of Switch 2. The new hybrid console, which works both as a handheld and home system just like its predecessor, has a lot to live up to.', 'Since its release in 2017, the original Switch has been a phenomenon, selling over 152 million units (making it the third highest-selling gaming device ever behind the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2), and reinvigorating the Japanese company both with flush cash and cultural clout. Whereas 10 years ago, people might’ve assumed Nintendo was a thing of the past, the success of the Switch has propelled the company into a new golden age. Now, it’s their crown to lose.', 'That might sound like a highly dramatic read of the situation for a video game console launch, but it rings true. As mobile gaming catapulted the pastime into ubiquity, the audience for video games is larger than ever. But despite a surge in popularity, the gaming industry has somewhat plateaued in its potential. While previous generational leaps felt earth-shattering — going from pixelated bleep bloops in 1985 to fully rendered 3D worlds in the span of a decade — progress is harder to come by these days. The best looking, feeling, and functioning games of 2025 aren’t really all that different than 10 (or even 20) years ago.', '', 'All that’s to say it isn’t enough to simply roll out new hardware with better specs and a solid sequel or two; there needs to be a real hook to pry people away from their phones and, especially, from the games they already have. That’s the mission of Switch 2: to grab hold of an ever-narrowing attention span, at home or on the go, and hopefully keep it for however long this cycle goes.', '', 'On that front, it’s hard to say whether Nintendo’s up to the task. In many ways, it feels like a safe bet that Switch 2 will be some kind of success; it’s better, faster, and stronger than its predecessor in every way. But the console (which retails at $449.99) also feels like a spiritual betrayal of Nintendo’s core ethos of innovation. As the first device in the company’s history to be slapped with a simple numerical sequel for a name, the messaging is clear: It’s more of that thing you already like, rather than something entirely new. Yet still, there’s a world where that might be enough.', '', 'Well, it’s in the name. The successor to the OG Switch looks a lot like the last one. It’s ostensibly a touchscreen tablet with two controllers that snap onto the sides. In handheld mode, it feels like a dream for anyone who grew up burning through batteries on a chunky monochromatic Game Boy. The screen is a massive 7.9 inch LCD display (up from its predecessor’s 6.2) that utilizes HDR (high dynamic range) and 1080p resolution to deliver high-definition gaming in the palm of your hand. The screen is also capable of 120 Hz VRR (variable refresh rate), which allows certain games to use the juiced-up GPU and CPU to run smoother in motion than any Nintendo device before.', 'Its controllers (called Joy-Con) are detachable, meaning that players can kick back and play with the device in kickstand mode, or hand off one to someone else for multiplayer gaming. Inside, the Joy-Con have all the bells and whistles modern gamers expect, from gyroscopes for motion controls to enhanced HD rumble for tactile feedback (a fancy version of rumble).', 'Placed in its dock, Switch 2 connects to a home display and increases its processing power to play games at an upscaled 4K resolution, bringing it inline with beefier consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at a fraction of the size. There’re still limitations; Switch 2 is a substantial upgrade from its predecessor, but its overall horsepower is closer to that of a PlayStation 4 (launched in 2013) than other current generation systems. That’s not to say it’s weak — far from it. With increased RAM and advancements in its architecture, the Switch 2 can run games like launch title Cyberpunk 2077, a game that famously shit the bed on PS4 and Xbox One. Playing as a hi-res facsimile of Keanu Reeves on a Nintendo feels kind of revelatory in that regard.', '', 'In short, it’s basically an upgraded Switch. But for what it lacks in flat-out gimmicks or quantum leaps in how people perceive video games — as seen in the jumps from the SNES to Nintendo 64 or Wii — it makes up for with subtle changes that do something new for Nintendo. Instead of making something people didn’t know they wanted, the Switch 2 delivers many of the things they did.', 'From a purely technical perspective, Switch 2 is a huge leap forward in terms of power. While Nintendo mostly conceded the corporate tug-of-war over graphical prowess back in 2006 with the Wii, the general plateau of visual enhancements over the last two generations means that games running on Switch 2 look pretty damned good even compared to more premium devices. Mario Kart World and the upgraded version of 2023’s Tears of the Kingdom look great, with the latter running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second, a far cry from the way the original version chugged along on the outdated Switch hardware.', 'But there was never really a question as to whether Nintendo’s first-party games would look good. Through clever art direction and intimate knowledge of their own technology, homegrown Nintendo games have always maximized the potential of their individual platforms. The greater potential here is for third-party developers to produce titles for Nintendo’s platform, after many previously absconded in the Switch era due to the limitations of that device.', 'Although no review copies were provided early enough to fully test from start to finish, in hands-on sessions, Rolling Stone was able to try Switch 2 versions of games like Capcom’s Street Fighter 6, EA’s Split Fiction, and most impressively, CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077 — all of which looked and felt impressively close to their original iterations on other consoles. While they mostly fall just short of the graphical fidelity offered elsewhere, with less textural detail and complex real-time lighting, every one of them worked, which itself is a feat given how comedically bad OG Switch versions of titles like Mortal Kombat 1 ended up.', 'They may not be the premier way to play these games, but Switch 2 versions are about as close as you can get to the desired experience, especially in handheld mode, without investing hundreds or thousands of dollars more for high end pro consoles and PCs.', '', 'The other changes are more subtle. The size of the console has increased without heavily impacting its weight, which is great news for lanky-fingered adults who previously struggled to comfortably play Switch or even the slightly larger 2021 OLED model. With a clean matte finish and magnetic connectors for the Joy-Con (versus the snap-in functionality of the older ones), everything about Switch 2 feels sturdier, cleaner, and more premium. Clearly taking some inspiration from handheld PCs like ASUS ROG Ally and Steam Deck, Switch 2 feels less like a toy and more like something an adult might want to play in public.', 'The Joy-Con themselves have new functionality, too, although there’s some omissions — namely, the much-requested inclusion of Hall effect joysticks, which are more modern, reliable sticks that could’ve solved the drifting issue that plagued the first Switch. HD rumble returns and is both stronger and subtler than before. In games like Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour (a glorified tech demo), tactile feedback can be used to detect minute vibrations in varying intensity. In Mario Kart World, engines hum beneath your fingers. Again, this is all stuff we’ve seen before, and it’s not quite as impactful as the tactile experiences in devices like the PS5’s Dual Sense Edge controller, but it does feel great.', 'The biggest change to the Joy-Con is a bizarre one that has roots in Nintendo history. At any time, the controllers can be placed on a surface, like a table or (surprisingly) your knee, turning the controller into a point-and-click mouse. Nintendo has toyed with mouse controls as far back as the SNES, but here it serves multiple purposes. In games like Mario Party Jamboree, the mouse can be used for mini-games like air hockey or dragging items to stack in physics-based trials. In first-person shooter Metroid Prime 4, players can shift from analog stick controls to hyper-precise aiming reminiscent of hardcore PC games. Even just clicking around the console’s UI feels smoother, and you’ll be surprised by how often the feature gets used (especially on a knee).', 'The last big feature is GameChat, and it could be a biggie. Essentially, GameChat allows players to connect with groups of up to four (for video) or 12 (for audio) people to talk and play together. Audio only requires the console’s built-in microphone, but with the additional purchase of a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera ($54.99), users can cast themselves virtually, even overlaying themselves on top of gameplay or in little boxes for their friends.', '', 'In practice, it’s almost like having a low-lift take on Twitch streaming, dropping players in front of a game for their friends to see without needing an expensive kit or green screen. Think of it like a playable Zoom call, with the ability for people to play the same or different games together, jumping in and out of sessions at will. There’s, of course, a one-click way to buy the game your friend is showing off to capitalize on FOMO. Unfortunately, the live feed itself is low-res, which is disappointing but fair considering that console is running its own game, direct feed from the camera, and pulling in three others simultaneously.', 'Compared to older console launches, Switch 2’s lineup is ultimately fine. From Nintendo’s own first-party teams, the killer app is clearly Mario Kart World. Bigger than any Mario Kart ever, it’s a perfect showcase for Switch 2’s increased power and social features and will be a guaranteed purchase just about everyone who buys the new console — it’s even offered as the sole bundle available day one.', 'Other than that, it’s a mixed bag. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a $10 mini-game collection that tasks players with studiously learning and implementing every new feature in the system. In what obviously should’ve been a pack-in title like PlayStation’s done with the Astro series at the launch of its new hardware, Welcome Tour makes for a fun distraction and a good way to test out all the new gizmos in the console. But it’s not a full meal.', 'Donkey Kong Bananza will arrive on July 17, positioned to scratch the post-launch itch with the first new 3D entry in the series since 1999’s Donkey Kong 64. But let’s face it, Donkey Kong is no Mario; and there isn’t even a murmur about when Nintendo’s most beloved figure will get a new game. You can, at least, play most older Switch titles on the new device, with many like Super Mario Party Jamboree and the Zelda games offering either paid or free upgrades to Switch 2 versions with new features like improved performance or camera/mouse integration. Switch 2 also brings back GameCube classics like The Wind Waker and F-Zero GX for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. But that’s kind of it.', 'Look, not every console launch comes with that game that will be remembered forever. In today’s landscape, most new systems are sold as cross-generational upgrades that have a handful of enticing new titles but mostly make existing games better. Without a Super Mario 64 or Breath of the Wild caliber title, that’s really what Nintendo is banking on.', '', 'Part of that strategy is the resurgence of third-party games, which could be the system’s saving grace. Day one, the offerings include ports of Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman World of Assassination, Street Fighter 6, Split Fiction, and Yakuza 0 — all of which are fantastic in their previous forms. Down the road, games like Star Wars Outlaws, Elden Ring, and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade could make a splash, with the latter signifying the long-awaited return of the Final Fantasy series to Nintendo after infamously ditching their partnership for Sony. Switch 2 will also welcome Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 this year, so there’s no shortage of non-Nintendo games to look forward to.', 'Assuming Nintendo can continue luring third-party publishers back into the fray to either produce good enough ports or, ideally, entirely new games (like Bloodborne-like The Duskbloods), there should be a slow trickle of releases that prevent any serious droughts like the periods that plague the original Switch in between Nintendo-exclusives. On top that, Nintendo has fostered a massive platform for indie games that helped bolster its profile in recent years, even securing the incredible get of Hades II as a console exclusive for a limited time.', 'It’s the million-dollar question, but the answer is complicated. Although Switch 2 offers a better version of a familiar experience, there’s very little that feels revolutionary. What worked great before — the seamless transition between portable and home play, smart implementation of its Joy-Con, and a likely future-classic library — is all present. What remains to be seen if its new features like GameChat have lasting potential.', 'There’s also the issue of price and availability. Although not cheap, the first Switch and its later Lite model were cost-effective alternatives (at $300 and $200, respectively) for gamers looking to invest serious time without breaking the bank. Conversely, Switch 2 starts at $450 without any games. Bundled with Mario Kart World, it makes the price tag about $500; but individually, the games are also more expensive with some titles like Mario Kart World costing $80 on its own, while others like Donkey Kong Bananza will retail for $70.', '', 'Despite that, it may still end up being the most cost-effective way to continue playing new games. Due to multiple factors, from increased development costs and the recent threat of tariffs, video game prices are up across the board with Xbox Series X systems rising to $600 (and PlayStation 5 potentially soon to follow). It sucks to say, but Nintendo Switch 2 might still end up being kind of a deal — especially with its GameShare feature, which allows players at home to share a single copy of a game between multiple Switch 2 and Switch devices to play all at once. For a full family of gamers, that could be a huge deal.', 'As it stands, Switch 2 is whatever you make it to be. Despite somewhat tempered hype around its launch, it’s still a new Nintendo console. If you’re the kind of person who’s insanely amped by Mario Kart, you’ve probably already got a pre-order. For everyone else, it’s wait and see, although Nintendo knows you’re watching. Odds are, you’ll break and buy it eventually.', 'We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC.

Nintendo Switch 2: Early review thoughts from our first days with the gaming system,https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-early-review-thoughts-from-our-first-days-with-the-gaming-system-143545893.html,"[""Now that most of us have managed to acquire our Switch 2, it's time to get playing. I mean, testing. The Nintendo Switch 2 became available in stores yesterday and started shipping out to those who got their pre-orders in. Those who pre-ordered via Walmart appeared to have been the luckiest, not only receiving their units first thing in the morning but also getting bonus snacks and drinks. Many of us who didn't get to pre-order one in April were pleasantly surprised that we were able to pick up the product in physical retail stores."", ""While we've already gotten a couple of detailed hands-on opportunities for the Switch 2, this being day 2 means we now have unfettered access to the new $449 Nintendo portable console with its latest release software installed. The liveblog below is a reverse chronological collection of our thoughts, but here's a quick summary of where we left things yesterday:"", '""We\'re nearing the end of the day, and here\'s a quick breakdown of where things stand and what we\'ve covered in this liveblog. For those looking to acquire a Switch 2 on launch day, it seems like most people making trips to retail stores were largely successful, and stock seems to be plentiful, even without pre-orders. Those who are looking for supply online are having a tougher time, while members of our team who pre-ordered have had to wait a lot longer for their devices to show up. Our Aaron Souppouris has received his pre-ordered... controller. But his Switch 2 remains en route and has yet to show up at his doorstep.', ""As for our review impressions so far — our senior reviewer Sam Rutherford is hard at work putting our official full review together, but he's been updating this liveblog with his evaluations today. He noted that, based on his lightmeter's readings, the Switch 2's display goes up to 450 nits with ambient brightness enabled, and tops out at 400 nits without. It's comparatively dim for a device with HDR, but the numbers can get higher depending on the game."", ""Sam also hasn't found the device to run too hot so far and that's not just because of the new dock's built-in fan. To him the dock is sleeker and feels a bit more substantial than before. He found it odd that the dock has just three USB ports instead of four on the original Switch's dock, but the new console has one more socket, which sort of balances things out."", 'Sam pointed out that the dock only has a single USB-C port, though, and that\'s reserved for power. With the remaining two ports on the dock being USB-A, you may need adapters to plug in your USB-C accessories, like the official Switch 2 camera, for instance. You could plug it directly into the Switch 2, but that\'s not ideal for people who frequently dock and undock their systems.""', 'If you prefer to catch up by watching a video, check out our Engadget Podcast livestream on YouTube, where Sam Rutherford and Devindra Hardawar shared their impressions and took questions from our live audience.', ""We've already written plenty about the Switch 2, and you can check out our earlier coverage to catch up on all the relevant details so far:"", ""Nintendo Switch 2: The final preview: As the headline says, this isn't a full review, but rather our impressions after spending some quality time with the Switch 2 at a closed-door Nintendo event last month."", 'How to buy the Nintendo Switch 2: Current in-stock availability on consoles and games: Walmart? GameStop? Target? The Switch 2 remains strangely absent at Amazon, but here are the quick links to online availability elsewhere. (Just remember that a product page does not imply available stock.)', 'The best microSD cards for Switch 2: Did you know the Switch 2 uses an all-new microSD card format for expandable storage? Our Jeff Dunn takes a first pass on the available options.', 'And now — our liveblog of our second day with the Switch 2.', 'This is also a good reminder that outside of the Switch 2 launch, this week is a great time for gaming with the recent PlayStation showcase and all the of the Summer Game Fest events coming up.', ""Somewhat off-topic, but not really since it's going to be available on the Switch 2. I gotta say I'm so excited for the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster. It almost seems wrong to get FFT on a Nintendo system since the game originally came out on PlayStation. But tactics games are great for being able to quickly pick them up and put them dow, which makes the portable nature of the Switch 2 feels like a perfect fit."", 'Another little quirk of the Switch 2 is that you can actually detach the Joy-Con and put them on the wrong side of the system if you flip them upside down. The controls still work in this arrangement, though obviously inputs will be ""flipped.""', ""One question I have Switch 2's engineers though is why they moved away from the mismatched Joy-Con colors. When attached, the only difference is the accent color underneath the analog sticks."", ""Things are a bit more obvious when the Joy-Con aren't attached, which lets you see the red and blue scheme much easier."", 'Do people prefer a more unified paint job or is simply making room for more Joy-Con color options down the line', ""One really minor design change I haven't seen a lot of people talk about is how the Switch 2's power/lock button is a touch smaller and more recessed compared to the original. It's not a bad thing, because on one hand I like that it's harder to accidentally put the Switch 2 to sleep. But it is a bit more difficult to find by feel alone, but I'm sure that will change over time."", ""FWIW, Split Fiction didn't seem nearly as divisive from what I've seen, its more of a sci-fi game."", 'As for other Nintendo titles, here is the official list of all the announced new and upcoming first-party games.', ""We don't have concrete release dates for everything just yet, but the big ones are Donkey Kong Bananza (July 17) and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (sometime in 2025)."", ""Sam, I am indeed on the lookout for nice co-op games but I've been seeing posts on Reddit about how It Takes Two has torn some relationships apart so I'm not sure if I'd like to continue down that path. I do really love the vibe of Inside by Playdead, so I am open to getting new recommendations there. Also — does anyone here have a recap of all the Switch 2 games that were announced at Direct? My cousin asked me and I was embarrassed to not remember more than Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza and... Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour."", 'A brief aside for the handful of folks who (like me) ordered through Nintendo\'s online store after receiving an invite: The company\'s shipping details may be incorrect — in a good way! I wound up receiving my Switch 2 and GameCube controller yesterday evening despite the order page on my Nintendo account saying they\'re still ""preparing to ship."" In fact, it still does say that as of 11am this morning. Obviously we can\'t guarantee this will happen for everyone, but there may be some lag there.', 'Yea fair. The new Joy-Con are a tiny bit bigger, but for extended play, the Pro Controller is still the way to go.', ""Also, Cherlynn didn't you say you were looking for co-op games to play?"", ""I've enjoyed my time with Split Fiction so far, but I must admit that it doesn't look as good on the Switch 2 compared to other platforms. There's a lot of aliasing and jagged lines."", 'Trying to be somewhat professional so I will say I chortled instead of ""lmao"" but yes my priorities are pretty well-documented. I bought the Switch 2 to make content for Engadget, really. And my own social media. And maybe to see if I can now better control my little chefs in Overcooked or jump from tree to tree with more precision in Limbo. The old Joy-Con were terrible for me. Totally their fault that I was so bad at games.', ""I still can't believe Cherlynn bought the Switch 2 camera but NOT Mario Kart World."", ""There's only one real new launch game from Nintendo and it's excellent. It's the perfect multiplayer too."", ""Luckily, there's always the eShop."", ""The bad news is that because there hasn't really been a mainstream gadget up until now that required the microSD Express format, there's a short of compatible cards on sale right now."", ""I went to two Best Buys and two GameStops and all of them were sold out of 1TB cards. 256GB models are a bit easier to find, but personally, I would skip those because I would prefer to have a single, larger card, even if there's a price premium for one."", 'Suffice to say, it might be a bit tricky to find a big 1TB microSD Express card in the short term.', ""This sort of brings me to the Switch 2's expandable storage, which revolves around microSD Express cards."", ""At this point, it's really important to mention that older microSD cards are not the same as microSD Express, so if you're trying to use the same card you used in your OG Switch it won't work. You need to find a card that has EX or EXPRESS printed on it."", ""One thing that struck me recently is that it's easy to forget that the original Switch only came with 32GB of onboard storage, so the upgrade to 256GB on the Switch 2 is much appreciated. However, even with that extra room, as I'm testing things, I'm installing everything I can get my hands on and I'm already running out of room."", ""The biggest storage hogs so far are Split Fiction with a file size of 69.2GB, followed by Street Fighter 6 (48.2GB) and Yakuza 0 Director's Cut (45.3)."", ""Mario Kart World is somewhat large at 21.9, but like many first-party Nintendo games, it's still noticeably smaller than AAA third-party titles."", ""I also think it's telling that I've seen a number of posts staying that their local store still has Switch 2s in stock."", 'If you are really desperate for a system, I would highly recommending looking for them in person.', 'Heck, Cherlynn picked up one at the GameStop in our nearby mall yesterday without having a pre-order.', ""We've talked quite a bit about Switch 2 availability and how to buy one. Several members of the Engadget team have been able to snag the system without a pre-order, just by turning up to a store and buying it. What a concept!"", ""There's another decent indicator that Nintendo has perhaps made more or less enough Switch 2 units to satisfy early interest: eBay listings. When the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X arrived in 2020, they were going for pretty ridiculous markups. It rare to see one selling on eBay for under $900 or so. Some units were going for as much as $2,000 — four times the list price."", 'There are, inevitably, some grifters trying to sell the Switch 2 on eBay for four figures. One is offering the Mario Kart World bundle for $2,495. Good luck with that, pal. But plenty of eBay sellers are offering it for $700 or less.', ""I'm not, by any stretch, recommending that you buy a Switch 2 for that kind of price. It's just interesting to look at what sellers are pricing it at on eBay as we try to figure out whether Nintendo has been able to meet demand."", ""Good call Kris. The Switch 2, even though it's bigger than the original, is still very portable. That said, it's not really small enough to fit in a pocket unless you have some like circa 1998 JNCO jeans. I also wouldn't chuck it in a bag by itself because that's asking for unnecessary wear and tear and stress on components like the analog sticks."", ""Belkin's new line of Switch 2 accessories caught my eye because the company made a case with a cutout for an included battery pack, so you can still charge the Switch 2 while its safely stashed inside. It's not the most elegant solution, but it is really practical, which I appreciate."", ""I'm still waiting for my Switch 2 case and screen protector to ship, but I might cancel that to save a few bucks. The Switch 2 fits well enough inside the Steam Deck case. That chances that I'll have both the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck with me when I'm on the go seem pretty slim."", ""The Steam Deck is bigger than the Switch 2, of course, so the latter doesn't fit perfectly in the case. Although it doesn't seem to shift around in in the case while I'm walking, adding some padding will give me some piece of mind. Either way, a good Switch 2 screen protector is a must."", 'I have so many thoughts Cherlynn, but mostly I\'m thinking about the controllers. I\'ll have something longer coming up about the satisfying Joy-Con 2 ""thunk"" sound, but also I show some love to the new Switch 2 Pro controller. I honestly hated the original Switch\'s Pro gamepad, it just felt flimsy and plasticky in a way that was very un-Nintendo. This new model, on the other hand, feels like Nintendo took a few cues from the premium Xbox Elite Controller and PlayStation Dual Sense Edge.', ""The Switch 2 Pro controller isn't nearly as customizable as that competition, but there are two rear buttons you can configure to your liking. It also feels far more like a high-end product this time around, with a smooth plastic case, comfortable and responsive joysticks and face buttons that feel far sturdier than before. I honestly love this thing. Tune in next week for a full review after I get a weekend of playtime with it."", ""Will second what Devindra said. I didn't hate the old Switch 2 Pro Controller, but it does feel like a generally more premium product. The rear buttons are a nice addition."", ""However, one nice thing about the Switch 2 is that on top of being backwards compatible for games, it's also compatible with Switch 1 accessories like the OG Pro Controller. This is nice for anyone who doesn't want to buy four brand new gamepads for the whole family. It also has implications for older titles like Ring Fit Adventures, because while the new Joy-Con don't fit into the straps for Ring Fit's accessories, you can pair OG Joy-Con with the Switch 2, so you can still play the game normally.""]",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

If not, you can skip any settings that apply specifically to these areas."", ""Perhaps the most crucial Nintendo Switch 2 settings to get right are found in the 'Display' submenu, so let's start here."", 'HDR Output', ""First, you'll find a toggle for HDR Output. This should be turned on by default as the Nintendo Switch 2 will recognize if you have an HDR-capable display. If it isn't, turn it on!"", 'TV Resolution', ""While you might be tempted to switch this to your display's native resolution, it's best to leave TV Resolution set to 'Automatic'. This allows the Switch 2 to change resolution when necessary, such as when a game has multiple display modes."", 'RGB Range', ""If you have an HDR capable display, the RGB Range should be set to 'Full Output'. I found the Switch 2 defaulted to 'Limited Output', which made HDR look washed out. You can also try 'Automatic'. Make sure that your TV is capable of displaying Full RGB before turning this setting on. Older displays tend to work best with 'Limited Output'. If highlights and colors look crushed or oversaturated, stick with Limited."", 'Adjust Screen Size', ""This one catches a lot of people out. Make sure you head to 'Adjust Screen Size' so that the Switch 2's output matches the size of your screen.

If you'd rather HDR only turn on when you play a HDR-compatible title, you can change this from 'Always Enabled' to 'Compatible Software Only'.

I’m still in shock, to be honest.', 'By Shaun Cichacki', 'November 19, 2006. March 3, 2017. As a Nintendo fanboy, these two particular release dates were monumental. These days marked the release of the revolutionary Nintendo Wii and the sleek and stylish Nintendo Switch. But more importantly, they were some of the most terrifying days for those hoping to get their hands on the newest Nintendo consoles. Wiis were out of stock everywhere, even if you camped out overnight. Switches were going for double or triple their MSRP on eBay. That’s why I feared the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, a system I didn’t even get a chance to preorder.', 'Until I walked into a Target at roughly 11AM CST and just… bought it off the shelf. I’ve never had the luxury of getting a Nintendo console on the launch day before, but that changed today.', 'FOMO is one hell of a thing. As someone interested, but not necessarily needing a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, I watched my social media feed fill up with folks excitedly bragging about their new purchase. My TikTok feed was filling up with gameplay clips of Mario Kart World, and I finally broke. My will was shattered, and I started checking online to see if there were any in stock. GameStop? Nothing, except for a massively overpriced bundle that came with a lot of accessories I would never use. Walmart? No luck on my end, but kudos to those who got their deliveries nice and early, with a Coke and Pringles to snack on. Best Buy? Nada. But then, that little red Target came to mind.', 'I checked their website, once again disheartened to see that the Switch 2 was not available online. But a small glimmer of hope arose within me. I noticed, at a store roughly an hour away from me, they had them in stock. Five bundles of the Mario Kart World / Switch 2. I called the store to verify this and headed out. As you can see, I wasn’t lucky enough to snag one of the Mario Kart World bundles. Some of the locals must have gotten their hands on them first. Hopefully, genuine fans and not someone trying to make a quick buck. But regular consoles without the bundled game? They had dozens of them. I left, shopping bag, Switch 2, and a physical copy of Mario Kart World in hand, and my first successful Nintendo product launch in my pocket.', 'When the Nintendo Wii first launched, I was only 14 years old. While we didn’t have the funds to get one at launch, my Dad took me to, ironically enough, a Target to try and secure a console for me about a week after. We waited — coffee in his hands, hot cocoa in mine — in the cold Wisconsin weather for the store to open. We were assured that they had Wiis in stock, but they were moving fast. He waited in line in the electronics department, completely out of his element.', 'I was busy looking at the Wii games, particularly The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. As the line slowly moved forward, I heard the booming voice of my Dad yelling at someone. They were trying to purchase the last few Wii consoles that Target had in stock, and he was threatening to kick their ass if they did so. Needless to say, I left that day with a shiny new Nintendo Wii in hand, alongside my copy of Twilight Princess.', 'Similar to the Wii, my brother had scoured the internet in search of a Nintendo Switch shortly after launch. He wanted to get me one for my birthday, and after finding someone on eBay selling theirs for only $100 over MSRP, which was a steal at the time, I had my Nintendo Switch in hand on March 12, 2017. Today marks the start of a new era. Much like my original Nintendo Wii that my Dad almost fist-fought someone for, I’ll hold onto my original Nintendo Switch for as long as I live.', 'It’s a cherished piece of my life, getting me through countless memories. While I have the new Nintendo Switch 2 in my life now, I’ll still revisit this console as time goes on. Happy to relive the memories of a time that once was.

The $450 console officially went up for sale at midnight ET on June 5, with several retailers offering the device both online and in-store. Predictably, online stock has dried up fairly quickly and remains highly limited as of late Friday afternoon. We've seen with the console available at Costco most recently, but you'll need a membership there to take advantage. Wider restocks will happen eventually, though exactly when is unclear."", ""Broadly speaking, people seem to have had more luck on launch week by visiting a physical retail store. We can't guarantee you’ll be able to snag one that way, but a few Engadget staffers managed to grab a Switch 2 on Thursday at their local Target or GameStop, even without a pre-order in place. So before you call it quits, check if a nearby Target, GameStop, Walmart or Best Buy — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — still has consoles in stock."", ""If you're still on the hunt for Nintendo's newest device, we're rounding up all of the information we can find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up."", ""Walmart opened up online purchases at midnight ET on June 5, but both the console alone and Nintendo's Mario Kart World bundle are out of stock as our latest update. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations. The company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location, but it's worth seeing if any store near you still has devices available."", ""Target began selling the Switch 2 in stores on June 5. The retailer warned that supply will be limited, and the console may be sold out by the time you read this, though you should still look into the locations closest to you. Anecdotally, Engadget's Billy Steele was able to pick up a Switch 2 at a Target just outside of Greensboro, NC as late as 4:15PM ET on Thursday."", ""The company restocked its online inventory around 3:30AM ET on Friday, June 6. Those listings were live for at least a couple of hours, which is longer than we would've expected, but they've since gone out of stock."", ""GameStop held launch events on Wednesday and has advertised in-store availability, though again this will vary by location. Engadget's Cherlynn Low was able to buy the console without a pre-order at a GameStop store in the New York City area on Thursday morning. That particular location had just under 80 units available, but its manager told Low that inventory would differ at other stores based on population."", 'The device is currently unavailable on GameStop\'s website. A $625 bundle that includes Mario Kart World, a microSD Express card and a few other accessories has been in and out of stock more frequently than the standard SKUs, though it\'s sold out now (and kind of a raw deal anyway). We briefly saw it return on Thursday afternoon, so it may be one to bookmark if you can stomach the extra cost. The listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle, meanwhile, now point to a ""Find a Store"" page.', ""Best Buy held in-store launch events and said it'd have limited stock at its retail locations starting June 5. It is not selling the console online during launch week, however."", ""You may have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since Thursday morning, with the most recent restock we've seen coming around 2PM ET on Friday. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well. We also saw the console at BJ's early on Thursday, but that's no longer the case as of late Friday afternoon."", ""Verizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on Thursday morning, but that's dried up, and only those with Verizon service were able to order."", ""Amazon doesn't have any form of Switch 2 listing on its website, nor does it list first-party Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. The company didn't take any pre-orders for the Switch 2 either, so it's unclear if and when it will sell the device."", ""Newegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll actually begin sales."", ""With all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing."", ""Nintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — many people who registered in April still haven't received an invite, and shipments haven't arrived yet for some who did order."", 'You can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below.

Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.', ""A next-gen Nintendo only comes around once a decade, which makes the Switch 2's launch feel like a birthday, graduation and Christmas (or your holiday of choice) all rolled into one. However, like many gift-giving celebrations, obtaining the Switch 2 comes with several implications for your wallet and how it will fit into your life. So after getting the chance to play the Switch 2 for nearly 15 hours across two different sessions, I wanted to put together one last preview about Nintendo's next console and if you should (or should not) try to snag one when it officially goes on sale on June 5."", ""Note: Another big reason for this second preview/hands-on is because unlike in years past, members of the media won't be getting review units prior to launch. So this story features as much info as we have right now before open sales begin later this week."", ""Nintendo hasn't deviated too much from the original Switch's template for its successor. You still get what is essentially a small tablet with two detachable Joy-Con, a built-in kickstand and a dock for hooking it up to your TV. That said, it feels like Nintendo has upgraded almost every component in some way."", ""The Switch 2’s screen is significantly larger at 7.9 inches across (up from 6.2 inches), while also having a higher resolution (1,920 x 1,080 vs 1,280 x 720). And while it's not an OLED panel, LCD tech has really come a long way to the point where it's honestly hard to tell (especially if you're in a well-lit room). You also get support for HDR and variable refresh rates at up to 120Hz on its native display."", 'The Joy-Con, while retaining a familiar shape, have also basically been redesigned from the ground up. Not only are they a bit larger, they also feature a new magnetic attachment system with a larger button that makes snapping them on and off a breeze. Haptic feedback has also been enhanced with HD Rumble 2, which provides a stronger and wider range of vibrations.', ""But that's not all because there's even a new C button for Nintendo's Game Chat feature (more on that later), along with what may be one of the biggest hardware surprises on the entire console. Thanks to small cameras built into the edge of each Joy-Con, when tilted on their side, they can turn into mice. This functionality is something I was skeptical about at first, but it quickly grew on me to the point where using the right Joy-Con as a mouse and the left as a traditional controller became my favorite way to play shooters like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond."", ""As a mouse, the Joy-Con work surprisingly well even when you don't have a flat surface in front of you. I tried using them on the arm of a couch and my pants rather successfully. That said, if you're a true mouse and keyboard aficionado, there's still a gap in accuracy and responsiveness between Nintendo's Joy-Con and a traditional desktop mouse, though part of this is because when rotated sideways, the narrow controllers sometimes tilt over a bit too easily."", ""Sadly, the big question I can't answer yet is whether these new Joy-Con will suffer from drift similar to what many people experienced with the original Switch. Nintendo says it's using a new setup inside that should be significantly more robust, but only time and lots of mashing on those analog sticks will tell us for sure."", ""While the Switch 2 is significantly more powerful than its predecessors, to what exact degree we may not know for some time. Its core specs include a custom chip made by NVIDIA that features support for real-time ray tracing, G-Sync, DLSS and what the company says is 10 times the graphics performance of the Switch 1. It also has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of built-in UFS storage (of which 232GB is available out of the box). There's also a microSD Express card slot for expandable storage, a 3.5mm audio jack, Wi-Fi 6 and not one but two USB-C ports (though only the bottom jack supports video out)."", ""But what might be the biggest indicator of the Switch 2's improved horsepower is the sheer number of third-party ports that will be available at launch (or at least its first month on sale). This includes titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Hitman World of Assassination and others, which are all games that developers didn't even really try to bring to the Switch 1 due to its more limited performance."", ""Featuring a 5,220mAh battery, Nintendo's official longevity estimate for the Switch 2 ranges from 2 to 6.5 hours, depending on the exact game you're playing. For a more real-world evaluation, during my second preview, I played Mario Kart World in handheld mode with the Switch 2's screen set to max brightness (with ambient lighting disabled) starting from 100 percent battery. After 30 minutes, the console had 81 percent left, so if you do some rough back-of-the-napkin math, that translates to a total runtime of around two and a half hours."", ""That number might seem a bit low, but in many respects, this represents a worst-case scenario, as the device was connected to Wi-Fi and its screen was on full power. Furthermore, while I can't say for sure the Switch 2 is like this, some gadgets discharge power slightly faster when their battery is at or close to max capacity. In short, I wouldn't be surprised that by tweaking its settings a bit, it would be possible to boost that time up to three hours or more. And of course, if you're playing a less demanding game (particularly an older Switch 1 title), I think Nintendo's upper limit of six and a half hours is very plausible."", ""Over time, the original Switch sort of became the system you whipped out when you wanted to play first-party Nintendo games or smaller indie titles as the console simply didn't have the horsepower to keep up with the latest Xbox or PlayStation. And while there are a number of third-party games like Elden Ring, Borderlands 4 and more that are planned to arrive on the Switch 2, the number of brand new games from Nintendo for the Switch 2's launch is rather thin: it's just Mario Kart World and the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour."", ""Granted, by the end of 2025, that list will look a lot better with Donkey Kong Bananza, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Kirby Air Riders slated to arrive later this year. The Switch 2 is also backwards compatible with games designed for the Switch 1, which gives it a rather large library out of the gate. But for anyone without a huge backlog, the lack of fresh launch titles is one of the biggest reasons that people shouldn't feel like they are missing out if they can't get their hands on a Switch 2 at launch."", ""Furthermore, while I've warmed up to Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour as it's a great way to learn about the console's capabilities. I still feel like it should have been a free pack-in that comes with the system instead of an additional $10 purchase. It's not nearly as fun or endearing as Astro's Playroom was for the PS5 and I would say it's only a must-buy for the most die-hard Nintendo completionists."", ""On the flipside, Mario Kart World is everything you want from a new installment in one of Nintendo's most iconic franchises and then some. According to Nintendo itself, this game has been in development since 2017 and it really shows. Between the interconnected tracks and free roam mode, Mario Kart World's map feels absolutely massive. The full roster and list of vehicles is also immense and there's a fun new mechanic that allows you to generate boosts without needing to drift or jump up onto ledges, railings and walls to do tricks. I've even heard that you can use this skill to dodge blue shells, though I haven't been able to nail the timing myself just yet."", ""At its core, the game has the same polished driving and item slinging that people adore. Just one word of warning: With the game now supporting up to 24 players in a single race, being in the middle of the pack is even more chaotic than before. You're basically asking to get constantly bombarded. Regardless, buying a Switch 2 without Mario Kart World feels like a mistake. That said, anyone planning on purchasing the bundle with both the console and game included should know that Mario Kart World comes as a digital download instead of a physical cartridge, which is a small bummer because otherwise the package essentially knocks $30 off the normal $80 price tag for the game."", ""In addition to your usual assortment of cases, screen protectors and portable battery packs, there are two types of Nintendo Switch accessories you're going to want to give some extra special consideration. The first is a microSD Express card, because while the Switch 2 comes with much more onboard storage than its predecessor (256GB, up from 32GB), with games like Mario Kart World featuring a file size of 23.4GB, depending on how big your digital library is, you might run out of space faster than you think."", ""Furthermore, you won't be able to use the same basic microSD cards used by the OG Switch, as the Switch 2 is only compatible with the newer microSD Express format. The good news is that this memory is significantly faster than before (potentially up to four times speedier), which should provide quicker file transfers and loading speeds in games. The bad news is that microSD Express cards cost more than your garden-variety expandable storage with 256GB options costing around $60 or closer to $200 for larger 1TB models. For a more in-depth rundown, please check out our full guide on the best microSD Express cards for the Switch 2."", ""The other accessory you'll want to think about is a camera, as you need one if you want to use the Switch 2's new video chatting capabilities. On top of that, there are some features in titles like Mario Kart World and the updated version of Super Mario Party Jamboree that use the camera to superimpose you or your friends' faces inside the game to add some extra personalization to the fun. Thankfully, Nintendo's official camera is relatively affordable at $50, though there are some intriguing third-party options like this adorable Piranha Plant-themed one from Hori."", 'There are two different tiers for Nintendo Switch Online. The basic $20 per year plan includes support for online play and Game Chat along with access to select classic titles from the NES, SNES and Game Boy. You also need it if you want support for cloud saves.', ""That said, Nintendo makes a strong case for upgrading the more expensive NSO + Expansion Pack plan ($50 a year) which adds in games from the N64, Sega Genesis and Gamecube. But perhaps more importantly, this premium tier also gives you access to upgrade packs for original Switch games including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The updates not only make these games run smooth, they also include some extra features like the Zelda Notes app and even support for HDR for select titles. So if you're worried about not having enough games to play on the Switch 2 at launch, NSO + Expansion Pack feels like a great way to instantly flesh that out."", ""One of the biggest additions to the Switch 2 is Nintendo's Game Chat feature (which includes a dedicated chat button). I admit, it's easy to write it off as Nintendo simply copying Discord and including similar functionality natively, but based on my experience with Game Chat so far, I've been impressed with how simple and convenient it is to use."", ""You can host your own chat room or join another (with people sourced from your friends list) and from there you can select between several sharing layouts and other options. There's a voice-only mode along with small and expanded views that show what your friends are playing in dedicated windows along the bottom of the screen. Up to four video streams can be open at the same time and a total of 12 people can be in the same group simultaneously. There's even a setting to turn on speech-to-text (or text-to-speech if you want to read what others are saying) with support for multiple languages as well."", ""Parents also don't need to be worried about who might pop into their children's rooms because they can manually approve who is allowed to participate in chat rooms with their kids via Nintendo's Parental Control app."", 'My only gripe is that some video features are a bit low-res, which results in some aliasing (aka jaggies) when you activate the face cutout mode or turn on the setting that removes your background.', ""One potential complication you don't really need to think about with the Switch 2 is if your TV can take full advantage of the console's capabilities. As long as it can handle 4K (3,840 x 2,160) at 60 fps or 1440p at 120 fps, you're pretty much set. That's because while the Switch 2 technically supports VRR at up to 120 fps, that spec only applies to the console's built-in display."", ""That may be a bit of a bummer for some, though depending on the title, the Switch 2 may be able to send out 120 fps content at 1440p, which isn't quite as good as what you get from some games running on the PS5 or Xbox Series X. But considering the OG Switch couldn't do 4K at all, I'll take what I can get."", ""Priced at $450 (or $500 for the bundle with Mario Kart World), the Switch 2 carries with it a bit of sticker shock compared to the $300 launch price of the original Switch. Now I'm not here to tell you if that's too much or simply too expensive in this economy. However, I think it's important to point out that when adjusted for inflation, $300 in 2017 is worth about $400 in today's money and that's before you factor in things like tariffs and taxes."", ""Furthermore, you'll want to consider your total spend, which may include the price of NSO, any games or accessories, or if you're lucky enough to buy multiple units, the cost to get more than one Switch 2."", ""When I got my original launch Switch back in 2017, I had no idea it would hold me down over the last eight years as well as it has. Personally, I'm planning to put my own money down on what looks to be a very thorough upgrade over its predecessor. And it's a similar situation for anyone lucky enough to snag a pre-order, as your mind is probably already made up."", ""The Switch 2 retains almost everything people love about its predecessor while adding extra polish and performance across the board. Yes, simply by the numbers, it's a lot more expensive than the original, but I'd argue that its upgraded specs and the ability to serve as both a home console and a portable game player puts it on equal footing when compared to similarly priced rivals from Microsoft and Sony."", ""I do wish Nintendo's first-party software lineup was a bit deeper at launch, but I think the Switch 2's backwards compatibility and much stronger third-party support are doing a lot to fill in the gaps until DK Bananza and Metroid Prime 4 arrive later this year."", ""That said, not being able to obtain a model at launch shouldn't be a major downer. Mario Kart World is the only major new first-party Nintendo game out of the gate and while it's so good that I'm certain everyone will be playing it for the next decade, those who can't won't be left in the dust. I feel like the real goal for serious gamers is to simply get (or save up for) one by the end of the year when more flagship titles become available. After all, as good as the Switch 2 has been during my previews, it becomes so much better when you can play it with friends and it's going to take time for supply to catch up to demand.""]",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlOVTFDUXpWaE5sWjBlSFpmVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZQkE1U011UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Stock quietly landed at shops yesterday morning, but less than 24 hours later, most of it’s been snapped up. Argos, Amazon, ShopTo and Currys have all sold out, and even Nintendo’s own site is showing nothing.', 'Right now, only two retailers still have consoles available – EE and O2, and you’ll need to be an existing mobile customer with a contract to order from either of them. Not exactly ideal.', 'We’ve seen surprise drops throughout the launch, though, so it’s worth checking back every so often in case more consoles appear. But for now, it’s looking pretty bleak. We’re updating this liveblog with every drop as it goes live, so stay tuned.', 'Read more: We’ve got all the details on Nintendo Switch 2 stock in the US', 'The Switch 2 might look familiar, but there’s a lot going on underneath. It’s powered by a new custom Nvidia chip, so games don’t just load faster, they look better and run more smoothly. You get 12GB of RAM (up from 4GB on the original Switch), and most of that goes straight into powering games, not just background stuff.', 'The screen is still LCD, not OLED, but it’s bigger at 7.9in and has 1080p resolution. It supports HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate. Colours pop more and motion looks buttery-smooth in handheld mode. There’s also DLSS upscaling built in, so older games look better. Sadly, while it supports variable refresh rates, it doesn’t work when docked – just in handheld mode.', 'The Nintendo Switch 2 on its own costs £399.99, and the main bundle with Mario Kart World costs £429.99. Buying the bundle saves you £40 compared to picking up the game separately, so it’s the better value if you’re planning to grab it anyway.', 'No big discounts yet – it’s launch day, after all – but some retailers have larger, more expensive bundles. These include the new Switch 2 camera (£49, Amazon.co.uk), the Pro controller (£74.99, Very.co.uk) and the official carry case and screen protector (£20.99, Amazon.co.uk), as well as extra games and accessories.', 'There’s a stacked line-up of Switch 2 games for day one.

You’ve also got Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Deltarune Chapters 1–4, plus more niche picks like Fantasy Life i and Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD. Civilization VII and No Man’s Sky are here too, and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour acts as a mini showcase for the new hardware.', 'On top of that, loads of older Nintendo titles have been patched with free performance updates, and Wind Waker, F-Zero GX and Soul Calibur II are now available through the new Switch Online GameCube library.', 'Jamie, one of our readers, has just got in touch with me on Instagram.', 'After ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 from EE on launch day, he decided to call up and ask about delivery times.

I’ve asked EE for clarification and will update this post when I hear back.', 'Buy now at EE', 'And the last of the Nintendo Switch 2 consoles at Nintendo and Very have gone. Your only chance to get one now is at two mobile carriers – EE will come the quickest and O2 will take ages to arrive. More stock may drop soon, so keep your eyes peeled.', 'So, I’ve officially had 48 hours with the Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s a definite step-up over the Nintendo Switch OLED.', 'My colleague Jake Brigstock and I have been putting it through its paces.

Nintendo’s just dropped some stock. You have to have a My Nintendo account to buy a console, but the stock is there.', 'There’s a standalone Nintendo Switch console and a Mario Kart World bundle.', 'Smyths Toys sold out around midday yesterday, but they’re taking orders once again.', 'It won’t be a fast delivery; the retailer says it expects stock between 10-16 June, and delivering your Switch 2 could take up to three working days after that. However, if you missed out on the console yesterday, this is a good bet.', 'Huge thank you to reader Mark Brooker, who got in touch about some Nintendo Switch 2 stock at O2.', 'It’s unlike any of the stock we’ve seen so far. It’s a Mario Kart World bundle and only for O2 customers. You have two options.
