Summer increases risk of rare but deadly brain-eating amoeba in the water.

It thrives in warmer months and has killed hundreds of Americans.', ""Infections are rare, but they're almost always deadly."", 'The warmest summer months are when you and your family are most at risk. The amoeba lurks in pools, splashpads, lakes, ponds and rivers. And it could be in your house already.', ""Here's what to know about the brain-eating amoeba, how to stay safe this summer while you enjoy swimming and playing outdoors."", 'The amoeba can enter the nose during water-related activities, like swimming in freshwater or using a neti pot, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'Once in the nose, the amoeba can travel through nasal tissue and olfactory nerves to the brain, where it causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Once the amoeba reaches the brain after passing through the cruciform plate in the skull, it starts destroying brain tissue.', ""According to a report from the CDC, the 71-year-old was otherwise healthy, but she used water from her RV in a nasal irrigation device. She'd done it several times in the four days before symptoms started."", 'She suffered from ""severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache and altered mental status"" according to the report. She was treated for suspected PAM but still developed seizures and died of the illness 8 days after symptoms started.', 'Lab testing confirmed Naegleria fowleri in her cerebrospinal fluid.', ""The amoeba wasn't found in her water supply, but the water wasn't properly disinfected."", ""Don't get water up your nose when you're swimming or bathing. That's the easiest way to avoid it."", 'Tap water can carry the amoeba. Be aware of the risks when taking baths, running through sprinklers, or using non-chlorinated swimming pools (such as those for children that might be filled then left in the sun or on hot concrete for days). If you use a nasal irrigator, be sure the water is sterile.', ""In 2013, Drake Smith Jr., 4, of McComb, Mississippi, died after visiting family in Louisiana. He used a Slip 'N Slide on a water system that was contaminated with the amoeba."", ""If you're swimming in freshwater, including hot springs, be careful. Especially in years water levels are low and temperatures are high, Naegleria fowleri can thrive in the leaf litter and debris on the bottom that gets kicked up at a swimming spot. Most infections have historically been reported in the South, but this trend is changing as more areas report cases. According to the CDC, climate change may be a factor."", ""Splash pads or water park water that's not adequately treated with chlorine can pose a risk too, but those infections have been rare."", 'Potable water is safe for drinking, cooking and bathing.', ""People can't be infected by drinking water that has the invader, the CDC says. And it hasn't been shown to spread in water vapor and droplets, like taking a shower or using a humidifier."", ""The amoeba doesn't live in saltwater."", 'The CDC says to use distilled, sterile or boiled and cooled tap water to irrigate the sinuses safely.', 'According to the CDC, about 10 people a year in the U.S. are diagnosed with the amoeba, but most die. About 164 infections were reported from 1962 to 2023. Only four people survived.', ""Young boys are most at risk, according to the CDC. The reason isn't certain, but it could because boys are more likely to dive or play in sediment at the bottom of a swimming area."", 'PAM symptoms can start about five days after exposure but can take up to 12 days to appear, according to the CDC. It can look similar to bacterial meningitis, which is also serious and potentially deadly.', 'Most patients die within five to 18 days of symptoms starting, so get treatment fast if you have been in warm freshwater and suddenly get a headache, fever, vomiting or a stiff neck.', 'Additional symptoms:', ""According to the CDC, Naegleria fowleri has three stages in its life cycle: cyst, trophozoites and flagellated forms. It's only active in the trophozoite stage."", 'When its food supply or temperatures are too low, it can revert to a cyst stage. That lets it cling in biofilm inside plumbing and on surfaces in pools. Then it waits for better conditions to change back to the trophozoite stage.', 'The amoeba grows best at temperatures up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. At all stages in the life cycle, Naegleria fowleri can survive up to 149 degrees.', 'Naegleria fowleri is moderately sensitive to chlorine, so chlorine and monochloramine are commonly used to treat drinking water and swimming pools.', 'Systems that use chloramine can develop a biofilm in pipes. Many of those systems in the South do an annual chlorine burn near the start of summer to flush out the film where the amoeba can thrive before temperatures heat up and help it spread.', ""A chlorine burn is also how systems get rid of amoeba if it's confirmed."", 'Bonnie Bolden is the Deep South Connect reporter for Mississippi with Gannett/USA Today.
