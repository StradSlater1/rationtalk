Criticisms Of Trump’s Washington Military Parade Are Not Unprecedented,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2025/06/03/criticisms-of-trumps-washington-military-parade-are-not-unprecedented/,"['', '', 'ByPaul Iddon,', 'Senior Contributor.', ""M1A1 Abraham tanks parade down Constitution avenue in a victory parade in the nation's capital to ... More"", 'Holding a large military parade in Washington, DC, featuring tanks, helicopters, and thousands of troops marching arguably lacks a certain level of grace and dignity. It is overly excessive and expensive, especially when those millions of dollars required could be spent on other, more urgent needs of the country. Furthermore, it conjures up images more commonly associated with dictatorial regimes rather than the democratic United States. And the streets of Washington were not built to have tonnes of heavy armor rolling over them.', 'These criticisms sound contemporary in light of President Donald Trump’s upcoming June 14 military parade, which will coincide with the 250 anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding and, coincidentally, the president’s birthday. However, these were some of the opinions appearing in the U.S. media the last time Washington held a military parade, which took place on the very same month 34 years ago.', 'Trump’s characteristically ostentatious parade, which he’s wanted to do since his first term, will feature, among other things, “28 Abrams tanks, 6,700 soldiers, 50 helicopters, 34 horses, two mules and a dog,” per the New York Times. It will also feature 28 Stryker armored personnel carriers and 28 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Even a World War II-era B-25 Mitchell bomber will participate.', 'The 1991 parade, dubbed the National Victory Celebration, was held on June 8, 1991, and marked the first time the capital had seen such an event since the end of the Second World War 46 years earlier. Unlike Trump’s parade, the 1991 parade honored a swift American victory in a recent war, the Persian Gulf War, which expelled Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi Army from Kuwait, which it had forcibly annexed in 1990.', 'With fireworks and fighter jets putting on a dazzling display overhead, approximately 10,000 U.S. troops marched in the three-hour parade led by Gulf War commander General Norman Schwarzkopf. President George H.W. Bush observed from a bulletproof reviewing stand. Abrams tanks in desert camouflage and Bradleys also rolled past cheering crowds. Even the MIM-104 Patriot air defense system, which became a household name in 1991 for its purported success intercepting Iraqi Scud missiles over Israel and Saudi Arabia, made an appearance. A total of 82 military aircraft of various types that served in the war, including the iconic F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber, flew over Washington landmarks.', 'A selection of the aircraft which flew in Operation Desert Storm, fly over the Washington Monument ... More', 'Cheered on by at least 200,000 people, the parade lasted three hours. By the end of the fireworks display later that day, at least 800,000 had gathered on each side of the Potomac River to enjoy the rare event. Not to be outdone, New York City held a parade of its own two days later featuring another fireworks display and an estimated 6,000 tons of confetti. Unlike its Washington predecessor, the New York parade did not feature any tanks trundling down the streets or military aircraft flying overhead, given the city’s ubiquitous skyscrapers.', 'Forbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.', '', '', '', 'There were minimal protests throughout the main Washington parade. Anti-war activists gave speeches in Lafayette Park, away from the parade route, but that was about it. Nevertheless, several press editorials critiqued the parade before, during, and after, using similar criticisms to those currently leveled at President Trump’s upcoming event.', 'One letter to the editor of the Intelligencer Journal argued that the parade lacked “grace, dignity befitting a great nation.” “Those who are inclined to support this parade might consider that its closest parallel is the old Soviet Russian May Day Parade,” the letter added. An editorial by Donald Kaul after the two parades even likened them to “Nuremberg rallies for Republicans,” adding that the sight of Americans cheering at tanks made him “feel like an Argentine.”', 'Critics today charge that Trump’s parade is “something that you would expect to see in countries like North Korea or the old Soviet Union or today’s Russia.”', 'The $12 million price tag for the 1991 parade also drew some criticism at the time, which invariably argued that the money would have been better spent on education.', 'Included in the $45 million overall cost of Trump’s upcoming parade is $16 million for repairing any street damage caused by the heavy tanks—the Abrams weighs approximately 70 tons. The army has already placed steel plates along the parade route to try and minimize potential damage, a measure that costs an estimated $3 million alone.', 'Unsurprisingly, the likely damage caused by Abrams tanks driving down Washington’s civilian streets was also an issue raised back in 1991. Ahead of the parade, engineers had to determine how many Abrams tanks the Memorial Bridge over the Potomac could safely hold without causing a collapse. They concluded it could manage one going no faster than 30 miles per hour at a time.', 'Doubtlessly similar calculations are being made again today.', 'One Community. Many Voices.

Trump Is Throwing Himself a Birthday Parade While Veterans and Military Families Face Cuts,https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-is-throwing-himself-a-birthday-parade-while-veterans-and-military-families-face-cuts/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'President Donald Trump is throwing himself a costly military birthday parade while veteran and military families are suffering under the impact of ongoing cuts to critical programs and services.', 'Restoring Social Trust in Democracy, Health Care Costs, Medicaid, +3 More', 'Senior Director, Media Relations', 'shananel@americanprogress.org', 'Director, Government Affairs', 'dmolof@americanprogress.org', 'On June 14, President Donald Trump will celebrate his birthday by throwing a costly military parade in Washington, D.C. Estimates currently place the price tag for the event around $45 million, though the final cost could be much higher as the U.S. Army has committed to repairing any damage that the parade is likely to inflict on the streets of the nation’s capital.', '', 'Trump says that this parade is meant to celebrate 250 years of the Army, seemingly deflecting attention from the fact that he is organizing the parade on the date of his own birthday. But if Trump and his administration were truly interested in celebrating the service of 15.8 million veterans, 1.3 million in active duty, and more than 765,000 reservists, his administration would prioritize investing in the critical needs of this population. The money spent on this parade could fund care for thousands of homeless veterans or preserve hundreds of jobs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).', 'In this moment, too many veteran and military families are suffering under the impact of ongoing cuts to critical programs and services, and many fear greater harms with looming cuts to Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and the Bureau of Veteran’s Affairs. Here are just a few examples:', 'Around 30 percent of the federal workforce are veterans—including hundreds of thousands of disabled vets. While veterans do have additional protections in place compared with nonveteran colleagues, some estimate that around 6,000 veterans have already been affected by Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts across different departments and agencies.', 'In March, the Associated Press published an internal memo from the VA that revealed that the Trump administration plans to cut more than 80,000 employees from the VA as part of DOGE’s efforts, placing thousands of veteran employees at the agency at risk of termination. And while the Trump administration continues to seek funding increases that would bring the overall Pentagon budget above $1 trillion, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also issued guidance to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)—where veterans make up just less than half of all civilian personnel—to reduce the overall workforce by 5 percent to 8 percent.', 'According to DOGE’s own data, the average salary of a VA employee is $103,588, and the average salary at DOD is $94,501. The cost of Trump’s birthday parade could preserve at least 434 jobs at the VA or 476 jobs at DOD.', 'On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill through the budget reconciliation process—the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1)— with deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits and enormous tax breaks for the wealthy. While the Senate will need to pass its own version of the bill, cuts to basic assistance and health insurance risk serious harm to active duty and veteran families.', 'Medicaid provides an important safety net for military and veteran families, many of whom face out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered by the TRICARE coverage for military members and their families. Around 860,000 military members use Medicaid coverage in addition to TRICARE—including 220,000 who use this coverage for their children—and 3.4 million children of veterans are covered by Medicaid. More than 10 percent of veterans are food insecure, and many rely on SNAP; 1.2 million veterans live in households that utilize SNAP benefits.', 'The House-passed reconciliation bill would kick 3.2 million people off their SNAP benefits due to ineffective work requirements and expansions to these requirements; while veterans would remain temporarily exempt from these requirements, the proposal allows that exemption to expire as of October 1, 2030. After that point, veterans up to and including the age of 64 would lose their benefits if they are unable to demonstrate they are working 80 hours per month unless they are exempt for another reason. Given the aging population of veterans, these work requirements place older, more vulnerable veterans at greater risk of losing access to critical benefits. In fiscal year 2024, SNAP benefits averaged around $2,250 per participant per year. Instead of funding Trump’s birthday parade, $45 million could allow 20,000 veterans who could lose access to food assistance to keep their critically needed benefits.', 'The VA provides a variety of critical services to veterans, including disability compensation; pension funds for those with limited income who meet certain requirements; health care (including medical, dental, and mental health); education benefits; housing assistance; and life insurance. As of 2021, around half of all veterans had enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration, and 2022 legislation (the PACT Act) expanded care eligibility for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals, driving further enrollment in the past years.', 'The proposed cuts to the VA may threaten these programs, and many fear that reducing the VA to its size prior to PACT Act implementation will interrupt care for hundreds of thousands of veterans. The cuts may also affect critical medical research programs that benefit not only veterans, but the population at large: VA-funded research has led to breakthroughs such as the nicotine patch, the liver transplant, and the pacemaker.', 'While the worst of the proposed cuts have not yet hit, initial rounds of layoffs terminated around 5,000 employees earlier this year, and the administration has put in place a hiring freeze. The VA was suffering from staffing shortages prior to these actions, and a workforce already struggling to meet veterans’ needs is facing further challenges to its work: VA employees have cited “chaos” and worsening morale at the agency. The cuts have already negatively affected workers at the Veteran’s Crisis Line, for instance, which provides invaluable support to veterans in crisis.', 'Like other veterans and service members, LGTBQI+ people have honorably served the country in a variety of roles in the military—and yet the Trump administration’s actions disproportionately harm this group. LGBTQI+ people have a harder time both paying for medical care and finding providers that treat them with respect and dignity. When they lose providers, they have a harder time finding new ones, and so any interruptions in access to service will have disproportionate impacts on them.', 'The administration’s specific attacks on transgender people add another dimension of harm. Since inauguration day, Trump has sought avenues to push transgender service members out of the military, and the Pentagon has ordered the removal of transgender people, stripping these service members of their access to many benefits. In March, The Trump administration announced it would stop providing gender-affirming care to transgender veterans or veterans with gender dysphoria. The administration has painted this care as wildly expensive, but the Center for American Progress has estimated that cuts to gender-affirming care amount to only a few hundred thousand dollars per year at most; Trump’s military parade would cover the total cost of this care at least 90 times over.', 'Donald Trump claims to stand behind American service members and veterans, but his administration’s attacks on the federal workforce and Congress’ spending cuts disproportionately harm this community. While President Trump spends tens of millions of dollars on a parade, those who have honorably served in uniform face compounded harms, worried about economic or health crises over the next months and years. But instead of prioritizing their needs, Trump is funding a ritual more akin to those hosted by dictatorships than democracies.', 'The author would like to thank Kyle Ross and Caleb Smith for their insights in contribution to this article.', 'The positions of American Progress, and our policy experts, are independent, and the findings and conclusions presented are those of American Progress alone.

And we’re going to throw a national celebration for the Army and the military writ large.”', 'The estimated cost of the parade is between $25 million and $45 million, excluding the costs of a major cleanup operation and the millions needed for the district’s roads, which are likely to be damaged by M1A1 Abrams tanks rolling across them.', 'The New York Times reported that there have been discussions about having the Golden Knights, the Army’s parachute team, glide down onto the street and deliver an American flag to Trump.', 'Crowley made no mention of the report, but said the evening parade will feature “Army and military technology” that goes as far back as the Revolutionary War, in addition to today’s “cutting-edge technology rolling down those streets.”', '“We are going to honor America’s veterans, both past and present, including our wounded warriors and our Gold Star families,” she said.', 'Fireworks will follow the parade, she added, as well as a ceremony in which Trump will oversee the reenlistment of 250 U.S. Army soldiers.', 'The White House has insisted that this month’s parade is about U.S. soldiers, their families, and American patriotism, but not the president personally. Still, Crowley and other White House aides who discuss the parade cannot help but make the parade about Trump.', '“This is an absolute gift, Steve, that America 250 is happening now while President Trump is in office,” Crowley said. “Once again, it really is a gift, and we all want to make sure that we celebrate in a manner that is fitting, not just of this extraordinary president, but of our extraordinary country.”']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVpMWFJ5TTNCNmQxTTRjbVZFVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdZVktKYUlHZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

Trump attempted to hold a military parade in his first term to commemorate the centennial of World War I, but it was abandoned after pushback over cost and logistics from D.C. officials.', 'The day-long celebration and parade is expected to be a massive military spectacle and unofficial birthday party. The parade procession is slated to take place on Constitution Avenue near the National Mall in Washington, D.C., specifically between 15th Street and 23rd Street on Constitution Avenue NW.', '“The event is designed not only to showcase the Army’s modern capabilities but also to inspire a new generation to embrace the spirit of service, resilience, and leadership that defines the United States,” according to a May 21 statement on the event organizer’s website. “The parade will trace the Army’s evolution from the Revolutionary War through to the U.S. Army of Tomorrow.”', 'Though the parade is on the same day as the president’s 79th birthday, event organizers and administration officials say it is solely to celebrate the U.S. Army.', 'Vince Haley, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said that Trump is planning “an historic celebration of the Army’s 250th birthday.”', '“As one of the first events of the year-long celebration of our 250th anniversary, this commemorative parade will be a fitting tribute to the service, sacrifice, and selflessness of the brave men and women who have worn the uniform and devoted their lives to defending the greatest experiment in liberty known to man,” Haley said, not mentioning the president’s birthday in the statement.', 'On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress voted to establish the Continental Army, organizers say, marking the creation of America’s first national military force more than a year before the Declaration of Independence.', 'Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Army, organizers say, with remarks and other celebration events expected to focus on various achievements and legacies of the branch.

We are witnessing the suicide of a superpower,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/02/trump-science-cuts/,"['The president’s assault on science dangerously undermines America’s superpower status.', 'On June 14 — the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and, not so coincidentally, the 79th birthday of President Donald Trump — a gaudy display of U.S. military power will parade through Washington. No doubt Trump thinks that all of the tanks and soldiers on display will make America, and its president, look tough and strong.', 'But the planned spectacle is laughably hollow. Even as the president wants to showcase U.S. military power, he is doing grave and possibly irreparable damage to the real sources of U.S. strength, including its long-term investment in scientific research. Trump is declaring war on science, and the casualty will be the U.S. economy.', 'Since the 1940s, when the University of Chicago, Columbia University and the University of California played a central role in the Manhattan Project, the engine driving U.S. economic and military competitiveness has been federal support of research universities. That partnership has produced most of the key inventions of the information age, including the internet, GPS, smartphones and artificial intelligence.', 'Federal support of university research has also made possible the success of the United States’ world-leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Advances enabled by federal support include magnetic resonance imaging, the Human Genome Project, LASIK surgery, weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, and drugs that have saved countless AIDS and covid-19 patients.', 'Follow Trump’s second term', 'Now Trump is sabotaging a research and development pipeline that is the envy of the world. The Trump budget would cut the National Science Foundation budget by 55 percent. Already, the U.S. DOGE Service has terminated more than 1,600 active grants from the foundation, worth $1.5 billion. According to the New York Times, the science foundation’s grants this year are being disbursed at the slowest pace in at least 35 years. The NSF directly supports 357,600 researchers and students; many of them will now be out of luck.', 'It’s a similar story at the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who subscribes to an array of crackpot health theories, has already reduced the HHS workforce by 10,000 people with buyouts or early retirements, and now he intends to lay off an additional 10,000. Adding insult to injury, Kennedy wants to prohibit government scientists from publishing in the leading peer-reviewed journals. “CDC clobbered,” one official told The Post. “The agency will not be able to function. Let’s be honest.”', 'These budget cuts are hitting hard at America’s — and the world’s — leading research universities: Johns Hopkins is losing $800 million; Columbia, $400 million; the University of Pennsylvania, $175 million. No school has suffered more than Harvard University, which has lost more than $2.6 billion in federal funds.', 'Indeed, Trump says he wants to eliminate all of Harvard’s federal contracts and give the money to trade schools. This is populism gone crazy. Valuable as trade schools are, they will not be making breakthroughs in fighting Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, strokes, sickle cell anemia or other diseases that are being researched at Harvard.', 'Then there is the administration’s assault on foreign students. Trump tried to kick all international students out of Harvard — an order halted by a federal judge Thursday. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has vowed to retaliate against U.S. allies that censor free speech, has sought to expel foreign students for expressing views he dislikes about the war in Gaza. The State Department announced last week that it was temporarily halting all interviews for foreign-student visas, and Rubio said the agency would “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students in the United States “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”', 'As The Post noted, about 100 million people belong to the Chinese Communist Party, most for careerist rather than ideological reasons. And of the 277,398 Chinese students currently studying at U.S. universities, more than 110,000 are pursuing degrees in math, science and engineering — all areas of weakness for the U.S. educational system. Expelling a substantial number of foreign students, who typically pay full tuition, would deal another heavy blow to universities already reeling from federal budget cuts.', 'It isn’t just universities that benefit from the presence of foreign students — so does the entire country. According to the Association of International Educators, the more than 1.1 million international students in the United States create about $44 billion in economic activity and 378,000 jobs. And then there are the benefits they deliver after they graduate, assuming they are allowed to stay in this country. The National Foundation for American Policy reports that one-quarter of all billion-dollar U.S. start-ups have a founder who attended a U.S. university as an international student.', 'The United States’ competitors are salivating at the prospect of gaining an edge in technological competition at our expense. France, Australia and Canada are throwing out the welcome mat to scientists who can no longer do their work in the United States. But the biggest beneficiary is likely to be China. Even before the Trump cutbacks, China was already catching up to the United States in scientific spending; its research and development budget has been growing by an average of 8.9 percent a year, compared with just 4.7 percent in the United States.', 'In March, Beijing announced a $138 billion government fund that will invest in cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum computing and hydrogen energy.', 'So while China is investing to win the economic (and potentially military) contests of the future, Trump is undercutting long-term U.S. military and economic competitiveness with his anti-intellectual animus. The weapons systems that will be paraded in Washington on June 14 won’t be of much help to the United States in the future if it falls behind in the R&D race with China. I fear we may be seeing, as suggested by China expert Rush Doshi, the suicide of a superpower.', 'What readers are saying', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVpMWFJ5TTNCNmQxTTRjbVZFVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdZVktKYUlHZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

According to The Washington Post, National Airport is expected to be “severely disrupted” from 6-9:30 p.m., with about 100 flights held at their departure airports and delayed an average of three hours.', 'The announcement notes that the parade, which celebrates the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and coincides with President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, “may significantly impact” vehicle traffic as well as air travel.', 'At this point, it’s still unclear what that impact will look like in Arlington — or whether any part of the parade will actually take place in the county.', 'A permit application from late March proposed assembling the parade in the Pentagon’s north parking lot and proceeding north on Washington Blvd. The procession would then cross into D.C. at Arlington Memorial Bridge and continue along the National Mall.', 'Right now, however, there’s some indication that the parade — which is estimated to cost between $25 million and $40 million, in part depending on how much damage the tanks do to public streets — could be less than half the original proposed length and take place exclusively in D.C.', 'Both the parade’s website and the U.S. Army’s website list the event as running only on Constitution Avenue NW between 23rd Street NW in front of the Lincoln Memorial and 15th Street NW in front of the White House.', 'While the original route was about 2.2 miles, this route would be less than a mile long and would remain in the vicinity of other festivities that the Army is planning on the National Mall throughout the day.', 'On the other hand, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency announced this afternoon (Friday) that the Pentagon’s north parking lot will be closed tomorrow through Tuesday, June 17 for the Army’s celebrations.

"Army preparing for largest military parade on the capital’s streets in decades, featuring 7 million pounds of hardware",https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/trump-military-parade-washington-dc-streets,"['', 'Millions of pounds of military hardware are expected to roll down the US capital’s streets in less than two weeks, fulfilling a dream of President Donald Trump but also sparking concerns about how the roads of Washington, DC, will fare under the literal weight of heavy tanks and fighting vehicles.', 'The largest military parade the city has seen in decades is expected to bring seven million pounds of vehicles and weaponry as well as a price tag potentially in the tens of millions of dollars, and this week the US Army has started reinforcing the roads that will carry the hardware downtown and along the parade route.', 'The parade on June 14 will feature dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles rolling through the streets of DC, as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces, officials said. Nearly 7,000 soldiers are set to participate.', 'Most of the tanks, vehicles and equipment are currently en route to Maryland from Fort Cavazos in Texas, and will arrive by train at the rail station in Jessup, Maryland, early next week. They will then be offloaded onto flatbed trucks for onward transport to DC.', 'But the US Army Corps of Engineers, which has been leading on the effort to protect DC roads and infrastructure, is confident in the mitigation efforts the Army is deploying to minimize damage – efforts that have cost more than $3 million alone so far, Army officials said. The total cost of the parade could be as high as $45 million, officials have estimated.', 'The damage mitigation efforts include laying steel plates down on roads, particularly at spots where the tanks will make sharp turns; putting new track pads on every vehicle to relieve some pressure and create separation between the metal and the asphalt; and ensuring the tanks move only at a walking pace during the parade itself, the officials said.', 'Col. Jesse Curry, the director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, told CNN that the Army has worked extensively with various agencies and DC utility companies in its planning to minimize potential damage.', 'The Army began laying down steel plates in roughly a dozen locations along the parade route on Wednesday night, Curry said, and is planning to put down matting at a staging area in West Potomac Park, near the National Mall, for the Abrams tanks to sit on before they roll down Constitution Avenue.', '“Our concern from an engineer technical evaluation on anything below the surface of the road that’s going to be damaged is very, very low,” Curry said. “We’ve got the best (engineers) in the world.”', 'The Army’s 250th birthday celebration has been in the works for two years, Army officials said. But adding a parade was the Trump White House’s idea, so planning for that began only two months ago.', 'Trump’s desire for a large military parade – featuring all of the military services – dates back to his first term. But it was scrapped at the time because defense officials said it would cost as much as $100 million and damage DC streets.', 'This month’s parade will focus only on the Army, making it slightly smaller and less expensive.', 'The Army Corps of Engineers began assessing how to protect DC infrastructure during the parade back in April, Curry said. The initial worst-case-scenario estimate to protect DC streets was roughly $16 million, Curry said. That would have been the cost if the Army “did nothing to mitigate” the impacts, he explained.', 'Now, the estimate has dropped down to around $3.5 million, which will include the cost for putting down steel plates and reinforcing them into the pavement with railroad ties, removing the plates afterwards, and any cosmetic upkeep that needs to be done in the wake of the parade.', 'Two people who are not in the military but are involved in the parade’s planning told CNN there are still concerns among some agencies over potential damage to underground gas lines – particularly on the route from the rail station in Jessup to the holding area near the National Mall.', 'But Curry emphasized that the Army Corps of Engineers assesses that risk to be “very low.”', 'The Army has consulted with the National Park Services, the Federal Highway Administration, DC Water, Washington Gas, Pepco, the Department of Transportation and “all the associated authorities and utility companies that would have rightful concerns,” Curry said.', 'During those discussions, the Army went over the expected route with the companies, looking at their underground gas and electric lines, which Curry said largely run under sidewalks instead of in the middle of the road. That alone mitigated some of the concern over damage to critical infrastructure, Curry said.', '“If we’re driving on sidewalks, something went really wrong,” he said.', 'Curry noted that the Army frequently transports tanks and heavy fighting vehicles on trucks all around the country, without causing infrastructure issues.', 'The parade is meant to tell the story of the Army through its 250-year history, beginning with the Revolutionary War, tracing through major conflicts and ending with present day. The parade route will begin near the Lincoln Memorial on Constitution Avenue, continue east to 15th Street, and end at the corner of 15th and Independence Avenue.', 'Here is a breakdown of what will be featured:', 'World War I', 'World War II', 'Vietnam War:', 'Gulf War:', 'Global War on Terror:', 'Modern Era 1', 'Modern Era 2', 'The parade will also feature an “extensive” flyover, Army officials said, involving more than 50 helicopters. Those will include AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Black Hawks and CH-47 Chinooks.', 'Finally, the Army’s Golden Knights parachute demonstration team will jump and present Trump with an American flag – the only part of the parade that will involve the president directly, Army officials said.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

The aerial display will complement ground forces representing 250 years of Army service to the nation.', 'Transportation experts note that modern city streets, designed for cars and trucks, lack the reinforcement needed for tracked military vehicles. The repeated pressure from tank treads can crack asphalt and damage underground utilities even with protective measures.', ""The parade's impact on District traffic and infrastructure extends beyond potential street damage.
