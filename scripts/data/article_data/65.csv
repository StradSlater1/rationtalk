But this June 2025, the team behind the Cosmic Evolution Survey, or the COSMOS collaboration, has made it a bit easier to explore, having released the most complete map of the deep universe to date. Stitched together from thousands of snapshots, the map is called the COSMOS-Web field, and it reveals almost 800,000 galaxies stretching all the way back to the universe’s start.', '“Our goal was to construct this deep field of space on a physical scale that far exceeded anything that had been done before,” said Caitlin Casey, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara and one of the co-leaders of the COSMOS-Web team, according to a press release.', 'Made from images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the map’s data is already available to the public, along with an accessible catalog and an interactive viewer that are open to all to explore. By sharing the data in this way, the team hoped to fuel further discoveries about the early universe. Indeed, the map and its data are already being studied to learn more about the first galaxies, as well as their environments and evolution over time.', 'Read More: JWST Images Challenge Galaxy Formation Theories', 'When the JWST started its operations, the COSMOS-Web team was eager to harness its power to peer into the deepest parts of the universe. The researchers were hoping to see the earliest galaxies, as well as the general environment around those galaxies, better than ever before.', '“We wanted to go beyond finding the most distant galaxies,” Casey said. “We wanted to get that broader context of where they lived.”', 'The COSMOS-Web field looks back billions of years, almost all the way to the birth of the universe. The earliest galaxies in the image appear as they did around 13.5 billion years ago, or approximately 0.3 billion years after the Big Bang, as that’s how long their light has taken to reach the JWST. That means that the map, which was compiled from around 10,000 JWST images, spans around 98 percent of the cosmos’ lifetime.', 'According to the team, the images are already starting to raise questions, showing more early galaxies than expected. “Since the telescope turned, on we’ve been wondering,” Casey said. “‘Are these JWST datasets breaking the cosmological model?’” The maps seems to suggest, for instance, that around a billion solar masses of stars appeared in these early stages of the cosmos — something that’s not explained in current models of the universe’s evolution.', '“We just do not know how to make that happen,” Casey said. “So, lots of details to unpack, and lots of unanswered questions.”', 'Read More: How the James Webb Space Telescope Takes Such Stunning Pictures', 'The team aims to find answers, which is why it made the map and its data available to all. The researchers’ intention was that their work would be used by teams around the world to learn more about our universe.', '“A big part of this project is the democratization of science and making tools and data from the best telescopes accessible to the broader community,” Casey said.', 'The JWST images that were combined to create the map were taken over the course of more than 250 hours of observation, making the map one of the largest projects from the telescope yet. The raw datasets were released to the public in shortly after their collection, though they weren’t really usable to those without special training and supercomputers in their original form. As such, the COSMOS-Web team worked to create more accessible catalogs and images that would allow more people to explore the map, together and on their own.', '“The best science is really done when everyone thinks about the same data set differently,” Casey said. “It’s not just for one group of people to figure out the mysteries.”', 'Of course, the COSMOS-Web team is still studying the map, too, looking for new insights into the early universe. “We think we have identified the earliest galaxies in the image, but we need to verify that,” Casey said. “There’s a lot left to learn, and we’re just beginning to scratch the surface.”', 'Read More: Why Do The Stars Look Pointy in Images From the James Webb Space Telescope?', 'Our writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

Already, scientists have found a treasure trove of early galaxies.', 'COSMOS-Web provides the largest view deep into the universe ever, and now an easily searchable catalog with all of the data is available to the public.', 'COSMOS-Web was the largest General Observer program selected for Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The survey mapped 0.54 square degrees of the sky (about the area of three full moons) with the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and a 0.2 square degree area with the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI). While previous surveys have aimed to help astronomers map and understand what exists in the vast universe, the advanced instruments of JWST have allowed COSMOS-Web to study galaxy evolution through a long range of history.', '“The sensitivity of JWST lets us see much fainter and more distant galaxies than ever before, so we’re able to find galaxies in the very early universe and study their properties in detail,” said Jeyhan Kartaltepe, associate professor at Rochester Institute of Technology and lead researcher of COSMOS-Web. “The quality of the data still blows us away.

It was incredible to reveal galaxies that were previously invisible, and very gratifying to finally see them appear on our computers.”', 'Likewise, MIRI plays a critical role in determining the mass of early galaxies and investigating star formation over cosmic time. It has already been instrumental in confirming some of the most distant galaxies discovered by JWST. Using longer wavelengths that are less affected by dust extinction, MIRI has the ability to detect and characterize galaxies at higher redshifts, or at earlier times in the universe.', '“With MIRI, we’re now accessing an unprecedented level of detail in this wavelength range, providing new insights into the processes driving galaxy evolution and the growth of black holes,” said Santosh Harish, postdoctoral research associate at RIT. “The leap in sensitivity and spatial resolution is extraordinary, and MIRI observations from COSMOS-Web are a fine example of what this instrument is capable of.”', 'Along with the data itself and three initial papers on the catalog, near infrared imaging, and mid infrared imaging, the data release also includes an interactive viewer where users can directly search images for specific objects or click on objects to see their properties.', 'In addition, two new COSMOS-Web studies—one examining the structural evolution of brightest group galaxies over the past 11 billion years and another applying artificial intelligence to estimate key galaxy properties from photometry—highlight the wide scientific potential of the catalog.', '“Thanks to JWST and the COSMOS-Web survey, we can now trace how galaxies shut down star formation, undergo morphological transformation, and how these processes are shaped by their environment across cosmic time, even predicting galaxy properties using AI-driven methods,” said Ghassem Gozaliasl, astrophysicist and researcher at Aalto University.', 'When the JWST launched in 2021, the COSMOS-Web team of nearly 50 researchers around the world had the longest observing time during the telescope’s first year. The team set out with three primary goals: to map and build understanding of the Reionization Era (in the universe’s first billion years); to trace and identify massive galaxy evolution in the first two billion years; and to study how dark matter is linked to visible matter within galaxies.', ' ', ' ', 'After more than 150 visits and 250 hours of observations, the JWST data from COSMOS-Web has provided the information to obtain those goals. The survey has sent scientists into a new age of space observation and data analysis, and has opened the door to a future of understanding and discovery like never before.', '“We have data and catalogs that we’re very sure of, that we’ve tested and put a lot of work into,” said Kartaltepe. “I can’t overstate how much the field has changed. With data from JWST, we now have a new window on the universe.”', 'COSMOS-Web is jointly led by Kartaltepe and Caitlin Casey, professor of physics at University of California, Santa Barbara, and is part of The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS).

COSMOS-Web is more than just galaxies; it's an attempt to understand their surroundings, including cosmic voids."", '""The cosmos is organized in dense regions and voids,"" Casey explained in a press release. ""And we wanted to go beyond finding the most distant galaxies; we wanted to get that broader context of where they lived.""', 'One of the things the JWST has revealed since it began operations is how many large, bright galaxies there were in the early Universe. Prior to its observations, the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that these early galaxies would be rare. ""It makes sense — the Big Bang happens and things take time to gravitationally collapse and form, and for stars to turn on. There\'s a timescale associated with that,"" Casey explained.', 'Before the JWST was operational, astronomers wondered how many more of these early galaxies it would reveal with its much larger mirror and more advanced technology.', '""And the big surprise is that with JWST, we see roughly 10 times more galaxies than expected at these incredible distances. We’re also seeing supermassive black holes that are not even visible with Hubble."" The raw numbers of observed galaxies aren\'t the only surprise. They\'re also finding different types of galaxies and black holes. In a paper describing the COSMOS-Web, the authors think they may be able to use it to identify the very first direct collapse black hole candidates.', 'This figure from the paper shows how different multi-wavelength surveys of the same region work together to paint a more complete picture. Image Credit: Casey et al. 2023. The Astrophysical Journal', 'Like other grand observations, COSMOS-Web both answers existing questions and poses new ones. The JWST has already forced us to reconsider our understanding of the early Universe by finding so many massive galaxies so soon after the Big Bang. COSMOS-Web reinforces that questioning, but it may also hold an answer.', '""Since the telescope turned on we\'ve been wondering \'Are these JWST datasets breaking the cosmological model? Because the universe was producing too much light too early; it had only about 400 million years to form something like a billion solar masses of stars. We just do not know how to make that happen,"" Casey said. ""So, lots of details to unpack, and lots of unanswered questions.""', '', '', 'In their paper, Casey and her colleagues write that the COSMOS-Web can help answer a long list of questions. ""The breadth of scientific studies that COSMOS-Web may advance is extraordinary and impossible to anticipate in full,"" they write. They emphasize that though its contribution will be powerful, it\'s not in isolation, and progress relies on contributions from other observatories.', ""The COSMOS Collaboration released the data to the public for astronomers around the world to make use of. They call this the 'democratization of science', and they hope that by making this data from the world's best space telescope widely available, it could prompt new discoveries, new understandings, and new questions. Initially, the data was in a format available only to those with specialized knowledge and access to supercomputers. It took two years for the COSMOS collaboration to take the JWST's raw observational data and make it widely available."", '""A big part of this project is the democratization of science and making tools and data from the best telescopes accessible to the broader community,"" Casey said in the press release. ""Because the best science is really done when everyone thinks about the same data set differently. It\'s not just for one group of people to figure out the mysteries.""', '""We hope the value of this survey continues to grow with time, as have many other deep-field observations before COSMOS-Web and JWST,"" the authors conclude.', '© 2025 Universe Today', 'A space and astronomy news site', 'Support our ad-free content', 'This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNUJRblJ2UTJwUlZGUlBWVkkxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdrZFVJcVdRR1NLU0FJ=-w280-h168-p-df

COSMOS doesn\'t observe quite as deeply to see the faintest things possible, but it does cover a large area, which lets us cover a very large cosmic volume. We still detect very high redshift galaxies, but we\'re able – because of the size of the imaging – to measure the scale of structures at high redshift,"" Kartaltepe said.', 'Light from distant galaxies and stars shifts to the red end of the spectrum because they are moving away from the Earth. ""A higher redshift means they\'re moving away from us the fastest, which means they\'re the furthest away; and we are seeing them as they were in the very, very early universe,"" Kartaltepe said.', ""The project relied on French supercomputer CANDIDE at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris to combine images into the single mosaic, and then actually run the catalog, which makes around 1.5 TB of data available."", 'The COSMOS project, which began in 2007, will use the catalog to continue its mission to understand a dramatic change in state in the early universe, about 200 million years after the Big Bang, or about 13.5 billion years ago. During this period, the early universe transitioned from being filled with neutral hydrogen – which blocked light – to ionized gas that allowed light to travel freely. This process, known as reionization, marked the moment the universe became transparent to photons.', '""We want to understand that structure and how where galaxies are relative to that structure has affected the process of reionization in the early universe,"" Kartaltepe said.', 'But COSMOS-Web is open to other projects from around the world, she said. ""Our person-power is limited, so there\'s only so much time in the day. Certainly, having the broader community dig into the data will be fantastic… and people will have ideas that we don\'t have and have completely different science projects that they want to do.""', 'NASA has funded the project so far through its Space Telescope Science Institute project, although that is set to come to an end.
