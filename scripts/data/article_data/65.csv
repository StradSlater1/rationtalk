An Underwater Volcano Near Oregon Is Ready To Blow—and It Will Be Livestreamed,https://www.vice.com/en/article/an-underwater-volcano-near-oregon-is-ready-to-blow-and-it-will-be-livestreamed/,"['Newsletters', 'By Ashley Fike', 'A mile beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean, something is shifting. The Axial Seamount, an undersea volcano about 300 miles off the Oregon coast, is swelling, quaking, and almost certainly gearing up to erupt. It’s really not a matter of if…more like when. ', 'Researchers say the signs are stacking up. “It’s at or almost at that inflation threshold where it erupted last time,” volcanologist Bill Chadwick told KGW. “So, we think it’s ready.” The volcano sits on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where tectonic plates rip apart the seafloor and hot magma creeps upward. Right now, it’s triggering hundreds of small earthquakes every day.', 'The West Coast has lived with the looming threat of the “Big One” for decades—a catastrophic earthquake tied to the Cascadia Subduction Zone. But this isn’t that. Axial Seamount erupts often, and it does so without causing surface-level destruction. No tsunamis, no ash clouds. Just lava reshaping the seafloor and hydrothermal vents belching out mineral-rich gas.', 'And this time, scientists are planning to livestream it.', 'Axial’s last eruption, in 2015, produced around 10,000 earthquakes in a single day. Lava flowed for nearly a month, torching the strange organisms clinging to the seafloor. But within weeks, new life moved in—proof that even in the harshest conditions, ecosystems find a way. “Life thrives in these inhospitable environments,” marine geologist Debbie Kelley told CNN. “Volcanoes are probably one of the major sources of life in our oceans.”', 'The magma chamber sits unusually close to the ocean floor, making Axial ideal for observation. Cameras and sensors on the Regional Cabled Array—660 miles of underwater cable loaded with instruments—are ready to capture the next blow. For researchers, it’s a rare chance to watch a volcano build, break, and reset in real-time.', 'Oddly, timing may not just depend on magma pressure. Past eruptions happened when Earth was drifting away from the sun, and some scientists think gravitational forces—like the pull of the moon on ocean tides—might help trigger the final rupture. It’s a reminder that what happens below sometimes syncs with what’s happening above.', 'The Earth is always moving under our feet. Most of the time, we just can’t see it.

A Bloated Volcano On The West Coast Is Set To Erupt In 2025 – And It's Being Livestreamed Now,https://www.iflscience.com/a-bloated-volcano-on-the-west-coast-is-set-to-erupt-in-2025-and-its-being-livestreamed-now-79488,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'SIGN IN', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'TOM HALE', '', '', '', '', '', 'Senior Journalist', '', '', '', '', '', 'SUBSCRIBE TO DOWNLOAD PDF', 'Assorted contraptions at the base of the western caldera wall of the Axial Seamount volcano.', 'Image credit: NOAA (Public Domain)', '', 'A\nbloated submarine volcano on the West Coast of the US is about to blow, and a good snippet of the event is set to be livestreamed straight to your screen. ', 'The Axial Seamount is an underwater volcano in the Pacific Ocean around 480 kilometers (300 miles) from Oregon’s beaches. The submerged feature towers at around 1,100 meters (3,609 feet), with its summit reaching 1,410 meters (4,626 feet) below the sea surface.', 'The last time it erupted was 2015, exploding with a flurry of lava and volcanic debris across 40 kilometers (25 miles) of the surrounding seafloor. Late last year, geologists put out a warning that the seamount was showing all the tell-tale signs that another eruption was brewing.', '“Axial Seamount has suddenly woken up!,” said the abstract to a talk given by William Chadwick, a geophysicist at Oregon State University, in December 2024. ', '“Based on the current trends, and the assumption that Axial will be primed to erupt when it reaches the 2015 inflation threshold, our current eruption forecast window is between now (July 2024) and the end of 2025,” it reads.', 'Since 2016, the Ocean Observatory Initiative has been keeping a close eye on the region around the seamount using an HD video camera. It focuses on a 4.2-meter (14-foot) hot spring deposit called “Mushroom” located within the vent field of the Axial Seamount. Along with its constant outpouring of fluids, you can expect to see white bacterial mats, small tube worms, and potentially other marine life.', 'Livestreams of the footage will be broadcast during the hours of 2:00, 5:00, 8:00, and 11:00 EDT & PDT, day and night, for 14 minutes. You can check it out right here: https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/instruments/high-definition-video-camera/.', 'Unfortunately, submarine volcanoes don’t abide by human timescales, so it’s very difficult to know when the eruption might occur. Be assured that, for now, the Axial Seamount is quietly mounting pressure at a rate that suggests an explosive event will unfold by the end of 2025. ', ""The good news is that it does not pose any risk to human life. It won’t produce any tsunamis, earthquakes, or even a smoke plume, so most Earth-bound observers are likely to be blissfully unaware of the power it's unleashing in the ocean. "", 'Whenever it does erupt, however, it could bring colossal changes to neighboring marine life. The underwater eruption could cover the nearby seafloor with a fresh layer of lava, wiping out some ecosystems while providing others with fertile new ground.', 'VOLCANOES,', 'SEAMOUNT,', 'NORTH AMERICA,', 'AXIAL SEAMOUNT,', 'OREGON,', 'PLANET EARTH,', 'MARINE ENVIRONMENT,', 'UNDERWATER VOLCANO', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox', '© 2025 IFLScience.
