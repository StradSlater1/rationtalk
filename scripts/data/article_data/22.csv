However, Fed concerns over renewed inflation pressures driven by Trump tariffs create a high bar for resuming rate cuts.', '""The labor market is slowing, but the pace of the slowdown remains too gradual for the FOMC to ease policy at its next two meetings, given its desire for greater clarity on the scale of the uplift to inflation from the new tariffs."" — Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics', ""The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employer survey shows a deterioration in the breadth of job growth, with a 50 reading for the diffusion index, which indicates an equal balance between the number of industries with increasing and decreasing employment.

The ranks of the employed tumbled by 696,000. Yet the number of unemployed persons only rose 71,000, because the ranks of labor force participants — those employed or actively looking for work — sank by 625,000.', ""Some economists have raised the possibility that Trump's immigration crackdown could have a negative impact on labor force participation."", 'Below the surface, the household survey shows that the number of people who have been unemployed for less than five weeks jumped by 264,000, which suggests a much weaker hiring climate. However that was mostly offset by a 218,000 drop in the number of people who have been unemployed for at least 27 weeks.', 'The S&P 500 rose 0.8% soon after the jobs report release, adding to modest gains.
