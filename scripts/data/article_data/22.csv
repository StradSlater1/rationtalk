China controls 90% of the global processing of rare earths.', 'But despite a 90-day trade truce with the United States, Beijing has yet to loosen these controls, drawing ire from Washington. That has led to China and the US trading barbs in the past week, over which side violated the temporary trade agreement reached in Geneva. All the while, carmakers have warned that factory shutdowns are looming as they find it nearly impossible to import rare earth magnets from China.', '“If it comes to the permanent magnets which are used clearly for civilian production, because you need them from washing machines to cars to any home appliance we have most probably at home all of us, this is extremely disruptive for the industry,” Sefcovic said.', 'On Wednesday, a European automobile trade group similarly raised concerns over the “significant disruption” in the European automotive supply chain posed by China’s rare earth restrictions.', '“China’s export restrictions are already shutting down production in Europe’s supplier sector,” said Benjamin Krieger, secretary general of the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), in a statement.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nChina has a powerful card to play in its fight against Trump’s trade war', 'Under China’s new controls, exporters of rare earths and magnets are required to apply for a license for each shipment and provide supporting documentation to verify the intended end use of these materials.', 'Since April, Chinese authorities have only approved about one-quarter of the hundreds of export license applications submitted, according to CLEPA. Moreover, the application process has been opaque and inconsistent across provinces, with some licenses denied on procedural grounds and others requiring disclosure of sensitive information, including intellectual property, CLEPA said.', 'German carmaker Volkswagen has previously told CNN that its suppliers have been granted “a limited number of export licenses.”', 'China’s customs data showed that shipments of rare earth magnets to Germany halved from March to April, the month the restrictions were put in place.', 'At their meeting on Tuesday, Sefcovic and Wang compared data on licenses granted, and found their respective figures did not match, Sefcovic said. The two sides will talk “relatively soon” once data is clarified, he added.', 'Instead of China’s current licensing regime, the EU trade chief said the bloc prefers a systematic solution, such as a general application once a year for each company, to avoid paperwork delays and stress applied to the industry.', 'Across the Atlantic, US officials are also growing increasingly frustrated by the slow pace of China’s rare earth export approvals.', 'US President Donald Trump’s administration believed that, as part of the trade truce, China would lift export restrictions on rare earths to the US – and has accused Beijing of violating the agreement reached in Geneva.', 'Some Chinese suppliers have been granted approval to export rare earths to several American automakers – although those operations may not actually be in the US, according to a person familiar with the matter.', '“However, the bigger picture remains, which is that approvals are going much slower than industry would like or require – there are apparently only a small handful of Chinese officials working their way through more than a thousand applications,” the source said. “The implication (is) that it is clearly not a priority for China to speed this up.”', 'A long-time rare earths trader in the US said his company is still waiting for Beijing to approve shipment requests filed by its Chinese suppliers seven weeks ago.', 'One of the application documents asked for a photo of the end user’s manufacturing facility, according to the rare earth trader, who requested anonymity to speak openly about the process.', '“I don’t know anyone who would be willing to do that. That’s where I get the biggest pushback,” he said, referring to his customers, who are mostly end users – in both civilian and defense sectors.', '“If the customers are associated with US defense, if they tell the truth, they’re not gonna be approved,” he said.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nChina isn’t getting rid of its controls over rare earths, despite trade truce with US', 'The export curbs have sent manufacturers scrambling to look for stockpiles of the now-restricted materials – and bidding at ever-higher prices. “Anybody who has stockpiles on those are selling 4 to 7 times the price that would have been available to the marketplace two months ago,” the trader said. In some cases, such as with the soft metal yttrium, customers are willing to pay more than 10 times the price.', 'But rare earth materials not on the export control list have also been impacted.', '“We’re seeing slower shipments. Chinese customs are scrutinizing the exports more than ever. All rare earths are being held up right now and taking longer to be shipped out,” the source said, noting that some suppliers have even refused to ship materials not on the restricted list due to the heightened scrutiny.', 'Shipments of rare earth magnets to the US plunged 60% from March to April, according to Chinese customs data.', 'China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Thursday the country’s export controls are “in line with common international practices, non-discriminatory and not targeted at specific countries.”', 'CNN’s Fred He contributed reporting.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

While most of those tariffs have since been temporarily paused, the rare earth restrictions remain in place worldwide, which is a problem since China is estimated to control more than 90 percent of the rare earth supply chain.', 'Companies that wish to export the materials now require a license, and those have been hard to come by — Nikkei reports that only 25 percent of requests have been approved. According to The New York Times that’s had a knock on effect, with some magnet manufacturers in China pausing production while waiting for exports to resume, which could cause more shortages in the future.', 'It’s a problem for multiple industries, including robotics and defense, with auto manufacturers at particular risk. Rare earth magnets are essential for hybrid and EV motors, but are also found in everything from catalytic converters to car seats. The Times reports that US auto executives are warning that production could be cut back within weeks, while after a first warning last week, several European part suppliers have already begun to stop work.', '“With a deeply intertwined global supply chain, China’s export restrictions are already shutting down production in Europe’s supplier sector,” said Benjamin Krieger, secretary general of CLEPA, in a statement. “We urgently call on both the EU and Chinese authorities to engage in a constructive dialogue to ensure the licensing process is transparent, proportionate, and aligned with international norms.”', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

"Hot Topics in International Trade - June 2025 - Rare Earth Minerals, and China’s Global Dominance",https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/hot-topics-in-international-trade-june-8533966/,"['', '', '', 'If I heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times, China is the sourcing capital of the world. I’ve also repeated this statement at least 400+ times in many conversations over the years regarding global trade. China, it’s also where the global market goes for rare earth minerals, among thousands of other necessary elements for a veritable plethora of life’s essential things. By the end of 2024, China produced more than two-thirds (approximately 70%) of the world’s rare earth minerals. Additionally, China controls over 80% of the global processing capacity for these minerals, which is a critical part of the global supply chain.', 'Therefore, I ask, does it make sense that we (the U.S.) would be poking the bear with a heightened trade war with more tariffs, when in fact they could, and they have, banned the export of many of these essential elements necessary within a multitude of manufacturing processes, including advanced microchips. President Donald Trump, recently posted on Truth Social: “I just concluded a very good phone call with President Xi, of China, discussing some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, trade deal. The call lasted approximately one and a half hours, and it resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries. There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products.” (Minerals, and it’s Tesla, not Tesler)', 'Hmmmm…….we shall see.', 'So, let’s take a quick look at just who holds the cards when it comes to these reserves.', 'Top Countries by Rare-Earth Reserves (2025)', 'These rare-earth elements are essential for producing things such as Smartphones and electronics, electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, military equipment, and advanced medical devices. China leads in both reserves and production, but as you can see countries like Brazil and Vietnam are emerging as significant players due to their large untapped reserves. Therefore, Vietnam and Brazil obviously have some cards to play with the Trump administration when it comes to the tariff negotiations, if in fact the administration is doing their homework. (Vietnam had one of the highest reciprocal tariff rates on the infamous chart) As far as the U.S., and our paltry 1.8 million metric tons, well, the largest, rare earth mineral deposit in the United States is currently the Halleck Creek Project in Wyoming. California also has some reserves.', 'When it comes to the U.S. throwing their weight around as the bully with the tariffs imposed on each country it does make one wonder, what cards do some of these other countries hold, if any. As President Trump was recently ambushing the South African President in the White House, Ramaphosa was touting the rare earth elements that his country possessed. His pitch fell on deaf ears. However, the continent of Africa as a whole is projected to produce about 10% of the world’s rare earth minerals by 2030, with South Africa contributing to this growth through operations like the Steenkamps kraal mine, which is known for having one of the highest grades of rare earth elements globally. Key operative words there are “highest grades.”', 'Another example comes to mind when the Trump administration was negotiating with Ukraine in the atypical transgressional transactional manner, where the rare earth minerals that they posses becomes a key element in the discussion. (I use the term discussion lightly) It also becomes Ukraine’s security if the U.S. was in collaboration with them regarding mining it. Putin wouldn’t dare upset that little apple cart of commerce, would he?', 'When looking at the quest for world dominance, and rare earth minerals, it’s really China’s game to lose, and I do not personally see that happening as China is leveraging the current trade landscape with the U.S. as the “bad guy.” Speaking of a quest, sometimes at night, when the work is done, I put my Meta Quest 3 virtual reality headset on and pop on YouTube and watch videos of China’s infrastructure marvels. It’s absolutely amazing what they have been building over the last decade, not to mention the unbelievable speed at which these mega projects are completed, but that’s an entirely separate article. So, without further digression, like I always do, let’s focus on just what these rare earth minerals are, and why they are so damn important. Stick with me, it’s going to sound like your geology class in college, where you really should have paid better attention because that “C” really brought down your overall GPA. Oh wait, that was me, anyway, let’s get specific.', 'So, why are these rare earth elements so essential? The exact number varies by chip type and application, but a typical microchip may involve 6–10 different rare earth or critical minerals, depending on its complexity and function, and thousands of everyday items that we use rely on microchips. Based on a typical day, the average person interacts with approximately 71 microchips. Yep, on a daily basis, we humans for the most part couldn’t function without these wafer-thin chips, planted in essentials like our Smartphones and computers. It’s also why China wants Taiwan, home to the largest manufacturer of advanced computer chips on the planet, but that too is an entirely separate article.', 'Moving right along, advanced microchips rely on several rare earth elements (REEs) and other critical materials due to their unique electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties. Here’s a breakdown of the most important ones used in semiconductor manufacturing:', 'Rare Earth Elements Used in Microchip Production', 'Cerium (Ce) – Used in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) for wafer polishing, a key step in chip fabrication. Lanthanum (La) – Utilized in high-k dielectrics for transistors, improving performance and reducing power consumption. Yttrium (Y) – Also used in high-k dielectric materials, often in combination with lanthanum. Neodymium (Nd) – Essential for powerful magnets in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Dysprosium (Dy) – Enhances the high-temperature performance of magnets used in chipmaking tools. Europium (Eu) – Important in phosphors for display technologies, which are often integrated with chips. Gadolinium (Gd) – Used in magnetic and optical applications within semiconductor processes. Scandium (Sc) – Applied in alloys and high-performance materials for chip manufacturing. Gallium, and Germanium', 'So, let’s also break down just who has how much of each in relation to these highly coveted minerals. Well, here’s a spoiler, it’s China of course, but let’s go one-by-one and get the whole picture.', 'As of 2025, China is the world’s leading producer of cerium, accounting for approximately 60% of global production.', 'Other Notable Cerium Producers:', 'Cerium is primarily extracted from bastnäsite and monazite ores, which are abundant in China.

It’s widely used in Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries for hybrid vehicles, optical lenses, glass polishing, and petroleum refining catalysts.', 'China is by far the largest producer of yttrium in the world. Most of the global yttrium supply comes from weathered clay ion-adsorption deposits located in southern Chinese provinces such as:', 'These deposits are particularly rich in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) like yttrium, which are scarcer and more valuable than light rare earths.', 'Other Countries Producing Yttrium (in smaller quantities):', 'China’s dominance is not just in mining but also in processing and refining, which gives it a near-monopoly on the global yttrium supply chain.', 'China is the largest producer of neodymium, accounting for over 80% of the global supply. The majority of this production comes from the Bayan Obo mine in Inner Mongolia, which is one of the largest, rare earth element deposits in the world and is especially rich in bastnäsite, a key source of neodymium.', 'Other Notable Neodymium Producers:', 'Neodymium is critical for making high-strength permanent magnets, which are essential in:', 'China is the dominant global producer of dysprosium, accounting for approximately 98% of the world’s supply. This overwhelming share is due to China’s extensive reserves of ion-adsorption clay deposits, particularly in southern provinces like Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, which are rich in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) such as dysprosium.', 'Other Countries with Notable Dysprosium Production:', 'Why Dysprosium Matters:', 'Dysprosium is essential for:', 'China is the largest producer of europium, just as it is for most other rare earth elements.

The key industries that rely on Tungsten are electronics and aerospace.', 'As of April 2025, China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements in response to U.S. tariffs. These restrictions require exporters to obtain special licenses, effectively limiting access to these critical materials for U.S. industries.(Currently being negotiated according to the Trump Administration)', 'The seven Rare Earth Elements Under Export Restrictions:', 'Honorable mentions are Praseodymium (Pr) and Samarium (Sm)', 'In conclusion, one must admit, China certainly has a distinct advantage in the global supply chain when it comes to the key elements needed to manufacture a good portion of the essentials in our daily lives. Even the world’s largest producer of microchips Taiwan’s TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), sources many of its rare earth minerals and critical materials indirectly through global supply chains, with a significant portion ultimately originating from China.', 'So, if you got this far in the article, and possibly your eyes have rolled up into the back of your head, and you think, ugh, why does this “stuff” that comes from the earth’s soil matter, I urge you to take a look at an even bigger picture, and that’s the race between the giants in chip manufacturing, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Samsung. Billions of dollars are being allocated globally to secure one’s place, and country, in the race for advanced chip manufacturing, as well as eventual AI dominance, which includes billions being spent by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The U.S. Chips Act is testimony to this causse with $50 billion being allocated to manufacture in the U.S. In my state of Texas alone, Samsung is building a $17 billion facility in Taylor Texas. NVIDIA is looking into Arizona for a possible facility, AMD will be manufacturing chips via TSMC in Arizona, while Intel is investing over $100 billion in U.S. chip manufacturing in Ohio. These rare earth minerals are the currency in our future. The race is on, and China has the best integrated supply chain from mining to manufacturing via chip fabrication plants, electronics assembly, and export infrastructure. The Chinese government also has heavily subsidized rare earth mining and chip manufacturing and invests billions in R&D for chip design, AI, and quantum computing. It has developed domestic alternatives to Western chip technologies, especially in response to export restrictions. By controlling both supply and processing, China can influence global prices and leverage rare earths geopolitically, as seen in trade tensions with the U.S. and others.', 'Is there a way forward unilaterally with the US. to play catch-up to the world regarding rare earth minerals? Well, maybe, researchers have found that the byproduct of burning coal could be a viable source of critical minerals and rare earths. President Trump wants to revive the coal industry, so this could be the catalyst for investment, or let’s just call it subsidizing. The researchers at the University of Texas at Austin mentioned last year that U.S. coal ash contains nearly 11 million tons of rare earth elements, eight times the country’s domestic reserves. They estimate that $8.4 billion worth of rare earth elements could be extracted from the accessible coal ash supply. However, extracting critical minerals and rare earths from coal ash is not a simple task. Processing rare earth elements involves two parts. The first is extracting the rare earth elements from the coal ash using a chemical extraction method to dissolve them. The result is a rare earth concentration, a mixture of all 17 different rare earth elements. Fantastic! The second part is refining, which is problematic since although there is an opportunity to extract a rare earth concentrate from coal ash companies would still need to send the concentrate to China to be refined. Imagine that, we need to work together. (Insert smiley face emoji here)', 'One almost final note: It appears that even gangs like the M23 rebels in The Congo are catching on to “digging in the dirt” for high valuable minerals coveted by those with the means to produce advanced microchips. The M23 rebels took control of the Rubaya mining site in Masisi territory in eastern Congo about a year ago. It’s now producing coltan, a key mineral for making modern electronics and defense technology. Congo produces about 40% of the world’s coltan. Coltan (short for columbite-tantalite) is very important in the production of advanced microchips, though not always directly in the chip itself. Coltan is a source of tantalum, a rare metal that is highly corrosion-resistant, excellent at storing and releasing electrical charge, and stable at high temperatures. Tantalum derived from coltan is primarily used in tantalum capacitors, which are small and reliable, and used in smartphones, laptops, medical devices, and automotive electronics. These minerals are one of the main causes of violence in the region. The DRC is rich in natural resources, including minerals like coltan, gold, diamonds, and cobalt used to finance armed groups: The exploitation of these resources and the illegal trade of minerals are major drivers of the conflicts, as armed groups use the profits to finance their operations. Rare earth minerals are the world’s new gold.', 'Another semi-final note: So, with an abundance of local resources, why can’t China produce its own advanced microchips? Well, China faces several significant challenges in producing its own advanced microchips, despite massive investments. The U.S. and its allies have imposed strict export controls on advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly since October 2022. These controls limit China’s access to:', 'These restrictions are designed to not just slow China’s progress, but to prevent it from reaching certain technological thresholds in chip performance. Due to the lack of access to cutting-edge equipment China cannot currently produce the most advanced lithography machines needed for chips below 10 nanometers. The best domestic machines reportedly support only 65 nm resolution, far behind the sub-10 nm capabilities of ASML’s EUV systems. China also faces a shortage of specialized talent in fields like EUV optics, plasma physics, and nanofabrication. ASML’s success is built on decades of accumulated knowledge and collaboration with institutions like IMEC and TNO. This technological gap is critical because smaller nodes equate to more powerful and efficient chips, without advanced lithography, China can’t mass-produce chips for AI, 5G, or high-performance computing. Modern chip production relies on a global supply chain involving hundreds of specialized suppliers. Even if China builds domestic alternatives, replicating the precision and reliability of global leaders (like TSMC, Intel, or Samsung) is extremely difficult. Even though China has made progress, it still lags in areas like, advanced chip architecture, process node miniaturization, and yield optimization at scale. It’s proof that even with massive funding (e.g., a $47.5 billion US chip fund in 2024-$333 billion yuan, $ one trillion yuan yet to come), technological maturity takes time. As previously mentioned, it took ASML two decades to get to the point of being the global leader in lithography. Building a competitive ecosystem from the ground up is a long-term endeavor, but China can, and will, catch-up. Just look at the litany of major technological breakthroughs they have had in just the last two decades. It’s amazing. I’d get specific here, but that’s another article. (China’s mega projects) In the meantime, China has been slipping in the area of countries with the most supercomputers, where the U.S. restrictions have been an evident reason for the decline. As of the most recent TOP 500 list (November 2024), the countries with the most supercomputers are:', 'The United States continues to dominate both in the number of systems and in total computing power, with El Capitan currently holding the top spot as the most powerful supercomputer in the world.', 'Final note: You may be asking , Bob you haven’t mentioned the other major players in chip manufacturing like MICRON. Well….there you go, and MICRON’s competitors are Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Intel, Western Digital, and Kioxia. These companies compete in the DRAM, NAND flash, and solid-state drive (SSD) markets. An entirely separate article, inclusive of ARM, who plays a major role in the process.

Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a US Geological Survey report.', 'On Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that “the administration is actively monitoring China’s compliance with the Geneva trade agreement” and that US officials “continue to be engaged in correspondence with their Chinese counterparts.”', 'Beyond China, rare earths are also featured in US foreign policy objectives with Ukraine, Greenland and Saudi Arabia.', '“Ukraine is a very, very nascent mining industry, and even though it was a part of the conversation, we don’t actually have a mapping of what’s economically viable,” Baskaran said.', 'CNN’s Nectar Gan and John Liu contributed to this report.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

"Rare Earth Curb To Affect Smartphone Makers, Price Hike Likely: Experts
If the situation persists, smartphones might see fewer advanced features, supply chain disruptions, or increased costs",https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/technology/rare-earth-curb-to-affect-smartphone-makers-price-hike/492974,"['', '', 'BY SHRABONA GHOSH JUN 9, 2025', 'Share', 'Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.', ""You're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media."", ""As new restrictions on rare earth magnets imposed by China are starting to choke India's auto sector – heavily dependent on the import of the magnets – another sector which can be affected in the near future is smart phones. Smartphone makers might try to absorb the hit for a while, but if disruptions continue, it can lead to price hikes or even delays in new launches."", ""In smartphones, magnets made from Neodymium and Dysprosium are used in speakers and microphones, haptic motors, and camera modules for OIS, etc. China holds almost a monopoly in processing rare earth elements. These rare earth metals are specially used to make powerful small size magnets that are found in almost every smartphone's components like in speakers, vibration units and display systems. As China tightens exports citing national security reasons, it has effects across the world."", 'The problem: Price hike, delay in new launches', '""For India, this could lead to delays in getting key components or paying more to source them. Right now the bigger impact is being felt by sectors like electric vehicles but smartphones may also face similar issues in the coming time,"" said Munish Vaid, vice president, Primus Partners.', 'Most Indian smartphone manufacturers depend on global supply chains which trace back to China. Therefore, even if India is not directly buying the raw material, any disruption at the source will affect the country.', '""While some of the final assembly for these components happens in India, rare earth magnet assembly for OIS, haptics, etc., is done outside India. While the auto sector might face the immediate effect of shortages and supply chain disruptions. Smartphones, although using less volume per unit of these magnets, given the sheer volume of smartphones produced, could see fewer advanced features, supply chain disruptions, or increased costs if the issue persists,"" said Parv Sharma, Senior Analyst, Counterpoint Research.', ""China's curbs on rare earth exports threaten not only India but also global supply chains. With China controlling about 60 percent of global rare earth mining and over 90 percent of processing capacity, countries are likely to face bottlenecks, despite efforts on localizing production. If the situation drags on, the costs of smartphones are likely to go up."", '""Smartphone makers usually plan ahead and have stock for a few months, but rare earth magnets are used in components like speakers and motors that are hard to replace on short notice. If Chinese exports slow down or prices rise, that added cost will eventually add up in the final product. It may not be huge at first, but for low-end smartphones, where margins are thin, these can either reduce margins for companies or consumers will have to bear the burden of price rise,"" explained Vaid.', 'How can India seek immediate relief', 'Indian OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers are likely to accelerate efforts to diversify rare earth sourcing from regions such as Australia, Africa, and Myanmar. In the short run, India should look at building reserves and sourcing from other friendly countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, Russia or Brazil. These countries have rare earth deposits and are eager to reduce global dependence on China.', 'India already has some rare earth reserves of its own. ""We need to ramp up local processing and manufacturing capabilities. The government\'s production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes could be expanded to support this space. Also, we should invest in recycling, old smartphones and electronics contain magnets that can be reused if we set up the right infrastructure. At the same time, our manufacturers and tech companies need to innovate,"" Vaid added.', '""We expect a stronger push to develop domestic refining capabilities. The government may also ramp up exploration and extraction of rare earth reserves in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha to strengthen long-term self-reliance in critical materials,"" said Soumen Mandal, senior analyst, Counterpoint Research.', 'According to IDC, in the first quarter of 2025, India\'s smartphone shipments reached 32 million units. The number of phones made in India every year is big, hence, even a small increase in component prices can add up quickly. ""With newer smartphones packing in more features, like better sound, stronger vibrations and advanced displays, the reliance on rare earths is increasing. The impact may not be as huge as in cars, but it is something that could affect both pricing and innovation down the line,"" Vaid explained.', 'There will be challenges in the near term to increase value addition in India — in the longer-run India will have to look for alternative sources — increase local production and recycle to de-risk from the global supply chain.', 'Correspondent', 'We put together a list of the best, most profitable small business ideas for entrepreneurs to pursue in 2025.', 'In FY 24–25, the platform also plans to deploy an additional INR 2000 crores through its Recur Swift program for startups.', 'Ideas come in many shapes and sizes, but not all ""good"" ideas are created equal.', 'Lauryn Bosstick, founder of The Skinny Confidential, says more founders should reverse the typical business playbook.', 'The company aims to simplify credit access for MSMEs through a straight through processing (STP) model, eliminating the need for branch visits', '""I never make any scripts.

China has come to dominate the mining and production of those metals, and over the last two years has gradually started to restrict international sales.', 'In early April, China announced new export controls on seven rare earth elements. Unlike other measures, Beijing did not specify whether they were a response to heightened U.S. tensions.', ""After both sides reached their breakthrough trade agreement on May 12, China's Commerce Ministry said on the same day that it held a meeting to strengthen export controls on critical minerals.  There was no broad rollback of the restrictions on seven rare earths."", 'This development came as a surprise to many in Washington, who had expected a repeal of the rare earths restrictions, since the trade agreement had said both countries would suspend most tariffs and roll back countermeasures for 90 days.', 'But so far, only some Chinese suppliers of U.S. companies have received six-month export licenses for rare earths, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday, citing a survey of members from May 23 to 28.', 'Among respondents affected by rare earths controls, 75% said their existing supplies would run out within three months, the survey said. The controls mostly affected sectors involving research and development, resources, industrial and tech, but not consumer or services companies, the survey showed.', ""While China did not mention rare earths in its readout of Chinese President Xi Jinping's call with U.S. President Donald Trump, the long-awaited conversation itself signaled that both countries would continue to talk, following accusations from both sides of violating the trade agreement."", '""I think we\'re in very good shape with China and the trade deal,"" Trump told reporters following Thursday\'s call. ""We have a deal with China, as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points having to do mostly with rare earth magnets and some other things.""', 'He did not elaborate. But Trump said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would meet their Chinese counterparts at an unspecified time.', 'Further trade talks will likely bring the U.S. and China back to where things stood earlier this year, with limited tariffs, Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, said Friday. He said China could accelerate some rare earths export approvals for commercial use, in return for the U.S. easing its restrictions on some tech exports to China.', '“I think both China and the U.S. have figured out that each other’s immediate weaknesses are not so much about tariffs, but more about non-tariff issues, especially in tech and rare earths,” Xu said.', 'The impact of China’s restrictions on rare earths extends beyond U.S. companies.', 'Several European auto parts companies have already had to stop production, industry association CLEPA said Wednesday. It warned of more widespread impact in coming weeks, and said China has only approved about 25% of “hundreds of export license applications” that were submitted.', 'China has recently appeared to ease some export controls, albeit to some European companies, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said Friday. But it warned that it was insufficient to “prevent severe supply chain disruptions for many companies.”', '“Our members are still struggling with the export licence approval process, due to both the time it takes and the lack of transparency, and this is now negatively impacting production lines in Europe and other countries,” European Chamber President Jens Eskelund said in a statement.', 'Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor briefly suspended production of its Swift car due to China’s rare earth curbs, Reuters reported Thursday, citing two unnamed sources, with manufacturing expected to partially resume on June 13. A Suzuki Motor spokesperson was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.', '“China’s export control measures are consistent with universal practices. Such measures are non-discriminatory and not targeted at any particular country,” China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said in response to a question about the Japanese automaker on Thursday, according to an official English-language transcript.', 'That echoed Ministry of Commerce Spokesperson He Yongqiang’s response to a question last week on Chinese companies restricting sales of a critical mineral stored outside the country at the Netherlands’ Rotterdam port.', 'She added during a separate press conference Thursday that China would approve applications for export licenses in line with its regulations, and to “promote convenient and compliant trade.” That’s according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese.', 'China’s restrictions on critical minerals have accelerated in the last several months.', 'Following export controls in Aug. 2023 on gallium and germanium, two metals used in chipmaking, China, a year later, then announced similar restrictions on exports of antimony, which is used in bullets, nuclear weapons production and lead-acid batteries. It can also strengthen other metals.', 'A few months later, China released a broader policy that tightened restrictions on exports of products that could have both civilian and military use. The export controls cover metals such as tungsten that the U.S. has deemed critical.', 'Tungsten is nearly as hard as a diamond, and is used in weapons, semiconductors and industrial cutting machines.
