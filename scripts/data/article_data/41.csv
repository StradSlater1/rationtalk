There’s Never Been a Better Time to Love Billy Joel,https://www.vulture.com/article/billy-joel-and-so-it-goes-documentary-premiere.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'As to whether Billy Joel: And So It Goes is about his music or his life, the answer is: yes. What Billy Joel: And So It Goes argues is that Joel’s life his music. His albums — especially the early ones — are mostly autobiographical. Piano Man’s title track is about Joel’s time as a lounge pianist in Los Angeles; Streetlife Serenade’s “The Entertainer,” on the other hand, is about how much Joel resented the popularity of “Piano Man.” A song like “You May Be Right” off his album Glass Houses, which features lyrics like “Even rode my motorcycle in the rain / And you told me not to drive / But I made it home alive” is about … well, when his ex-wife and then-manager Elizabeth Weber Small got mad at him for riding his motorcycle in the rain. It’s never been that deep with Joel’s music, but it’s never had to be. Through extensive archival footage, Lacy and Levin are able to show that Joel has always been one of the country’s best showmen. The music is good, his penchant for melody is undeniable, but what made Joel the artist we think of him as is how he is in front of a live audience. He’s hammy and energetic. Per his former Attila bandmate and longtime friend Jon Small, there’s an inherently corny quality to Joel that makes it hard not to love him.', 'I’ve seen Joel twice during his Madison Square Garden residency (including one of his late October shows where he serenaded a skull onstage to celebrate Halloween), and the applause in the audience after each number in Billy Joel: And So It Goes was indistinguishable from seeing him live. People go nuts for Billy Joel in New York. “Piano Man” got applause. Then “She’s Always a Woman” got applause. “New York State of Mind” got what might have tipped into a standing ovation if the documentary ended there. The enthusiasm wasn’t just about the music either — at the introduction of each other of Joel’s bandmates as talking heads in the film, the crowd went crazy. These guys are an extension of all that makes Joel great: his lifelong loyalty to them as emblematic of what’s so meaningful about this type of working-class New York City artist. He stayed true to his Long Island roots no matter what the label or a producer said. Corny as he is, Joel is consistent in who he is and what he stands for. People applauded when Joel won Grammys in the film. The excitement in the room never wavered. It was as if the audience thought if they were loud enough, Joel might be able to hear them in real life.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWFOSGRGZUdjME5YSlpWRUk1VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZMWdwUVVNUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

', 'For the first time in over four decades, the 76-year-old stepped into the spotlight to reflect on their tumultuous yet transformative eight-year marriage.', 'Elizabeth, whose striking silver hair and quiet confidence captivated onlookers, arrived at the Tribeca Festival event at the Beacon Theatre with her son Sean Small, 59, from her first marriage. ', '""It was great then, it’s great whenever I think about it, and it’s great now [to revisit],"" she told People.', 'Her words come as she takes on a central role in the two-part HBO documentary directed by Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin.

""I was just in love with a woman,"" he confesses of Elizabeth, whose affair with him ended her marriage to his bandmate Jon Small. ""And I got punched in the nose [by Jon], which I deserved.""', 'But the romance was far from a fairytale. After briefly leaving both men, Elizabeth’s absence plunged the future Grammy winner into despair. ', 'In one of the film’s most raw moments, Billy reveals he attempted to take his own life—twice. First with sleeping pills, then with furniture polish. ""You can\'t even do yourself in,"" he says wryly, reflecting on that dark period.', 'That pain, however, would go on to inspire his breakthrough debut album Cold Spring Harbor, including the soul-baring track She\'s Got a Way. ""You could tell from the lyrics that he was really in love with Elizabeth,"" says Jon Small, who is featured in the documentary alongside his ex-wife.', 'The love story wasn’t over. Elizabeth and Billy rekindled their romance, marrying in 1973. More than just his partner, she became his manager — a savvy, strategic force who transformed his career. ', 'It was Elizabeth who famously convinced Billy to release Just The Way You Are as a single, a track he had written for her birthday but had doubts about.', '""I didn’t even want that song on the album,"" Billy confesses in the film. But Elizabeth had other plans. She reportedly quipped, ""Do I get the publishing too?"" with her signature wit.', 'Her instincts were right.

Together, they were a power couple, artist and muse, business and romance intertwined.', 'But the highs gave way to lows. As Billy’s fame grew, so did his struggles with substance abuse. By the early 1980s, Elizabeth walked away — from the marriage and from managing his career. It was around the same time Billy suffered a serious motorcycle accident while intoxicated, requiring surgery on both hands. ""I was amazed that I was still alive,"" he admits in the film. ""I should’ve died in that accident.""', 'Billy would go on to marry supermodel Christie Brinkley in 1985, with whom he shares daughter Alexa Ray. Meanwhile, Elizabeth slipped quietly out of public view.', 'Now, at 82, she has re-emerged with grace and purpose, explaining why she chose to participate in the documentary. ""Susan approached me in a very personal way, and it resonated with me,"" she explained. ""Billy licensed the music, so I knew there would be good music. It felt right — and it still does.""', 'Elizabeth’s decision to step forward was encouraged by her granddaughters and long-time friend Steve Cohen, an executive producer on the project. ""She’s been maligned incredibly in the blogosphere,"" Cohen said, referencing years of speculation and criticism around her role in Billy’s early life.', 'But on Wednesday night, the narrative began to shift. Dressed elegantly and walking arm-in-arm with her son Sean, Elizabeth made a quiet but powerful statement. Her presence offered a rare window into one of the most influential yet misunderstood chapters in Billy Joel’s story.', 'Notably absent from the premiere was Billy himself. The Piano Man singer is currently recovering from a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus — a neurological condition that can affect hearing, vision, and balance. Co-director Susan Lacy offered a hopeful update, telling The Hollywood Reporter, ""He’s going to be fine.

Dan Goldman blasted Bondi for the subsequent delays. “People are asking if she’s covering for Trump?” he wrote on X. Which, in light of Musk’s allegation, looks very prescient.

Fans were shocked last week when the supermodel sisters Gigi and Bella revealed that a third Hadid daughter was found: half-sister Aydan Nix, 23, who is the result of their father Mohamed’s “brief romance” after his divorce from Yolanda. But the Hadids’ week in the headlines had only just begun. People reported Thursday that the Hadid matriarch had split with Jingoli, who she met in 2017. The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 61, ended their engagement in January. Jingoli, 66, had popped the question while the two were in Holland in 2022 and although their relationship stayed private, Hadid made their status public in 2024 when she called him her “fiancé” in an interview with Architectural Digest.

In one scene from Billy Joel: And So It Goes, the “Uptown Girl” singer shares that in his early twenties, he twice attempted suicide after having an affair with Elizabeth Weber, the wife of his Attila bandmate, Jon Small. Now 76, Joel says that he moved in with Small shortly before Attila disbanded in 1970, but quickly realized he was falling in love with Weber. Weber, who also appears in the documentary, says Joel eventually came clean to Small, which ruined their friendship and caused Weber to cut ties with both men. In the aftermath, Joel says he carried out two suicide attempts, the first of which landed him in a coma. “I was depressed, I think to the point of almost being psychotic,” Joel says in the documentary. ”So I figured, ‘That’s it. I don’t want to live anymore.’” The singer began mental health treatment after his second attempt and says he eventually learned to “channel that stuff into music.” He later reconciled with Weber, and the pair were married from 1973 to 1982.', 'If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing or texting 988.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'SHOP WITH SCOUTED', 'Scouted selects products independently.
