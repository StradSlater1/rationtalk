The potential cuts have sparked fears about the future of the Artemis mission and the role Michoud plays in building rockets to return Americans to the moon and eventually send them to Mars.', '“The biggest asset that we have in our region is NASA Michoud Assembly Facility, or MAF,” said Josh Tatum, vice president of business growth and retention for Greater New Orleans Inc. “Michoud right now is the bedrock for getting us to the moon and to Mars.”', 'Tatum said GNO Inc. is actively working to secure new funding streams and shield Michoud from the impact of the cuts. He pointed to negotiations in the Senate that could bring billions of dollars back to NASA.', '“With the leadership that is happening in the Senate, there is talks to continue funding opportunities in a reconciliation bill,” Tatum said. “GNO Inc. is pushing that is going to support 10 billion dollars that is going to continue the mission to the moon and Mars.”', 'Roughly half of that proposed $10 billion would support Artemis 4 and 5 missions. Another $1 billion is earmarked for facility upgrades at NASA centers nationwide, including the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and Michoud in New Orleans.', 'The funding uncertainty has prompted some local leaders to question the rationale behind the cuts, especially given Louisiana’s electoral support for President Trump in 2020.', '“It would seem to me that the spoils of war would go to the victor, am I right?” said New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas. “When you talk about space travel, and many of the programs that have been supported at NASA, many of the workers come from all over the region.”', 'Thomas noted that Michoud doesn’t just employ New Orleanians. Workers commute from Mississippi and western Louisiana, and any job losses would ripple throughout the Gulf South.', '“We’ve been known as a one-trick pony, with tourism, for far too long,” Thomas said. “This region, this city, cannot afford to lose any jobs that are related to any sector of our economy. Extremely important.”', 'Though no one is suggesting Michoud will shut down, economic analysts warn that cuts could strain local businesses, depress real estate in New Orleans East, and diminish career prospects for students in STEM programs at regional colleges.', '“The lights will not be turned off tomorrow,” Tatum said. “But we know that we have a runway, and if we are strategic and do this right, and work together with our industry partners and our federal delegations, we can make MAF or Michoud one of the best manufacturing assets there is in the world that will get us to not only the moon and Mars, but past what that can be.”', 'GNO Inc. stated that a decision on the $10 billion funding package could be made by the end of next month.', 'See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

NASA’s future in the balance,https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4999/1,"['At the end of last week, the space community was gearing up for more bad news. While there was no formal announcement, NASA was widely expected to release more details about its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal. The White House had released top-level details in a “skinny” budget released in early May (see “Budget cuts and the fraying of international partnerships”, The Space Review, May 12, 2025), but NASA would go into details about how the cuts in the skinny budget would be implemented: which missions and programs would be cancelled or scaled back, and which few lucky ones would be increased.', 'The release of the detailed budget would help illustrate the magnitude of the reductions to the space community as well as to members of Congress who, in the coming weeks and months will consider, or cast aside, the proposal as they craft appropriations bills. It was also shaping up to be the first major challenge for NASA incoming administrator—until it wasn’t.', 'Normally NASA budget rollouts are events. In recent years, NASA administrators have given “State of NASA” speeches the day the budget is announced, with a briefing later in the day to discuss what was in, or cut from, the proposal.', 'This year was different. There was no “State of NASA” speech, no briefing, no press release, and not even a formal advisory in advance. Instead, at about 4 pm EDT on Friday the 30th, NASA posted the documents on its website with zero fanfare.', 'Looking at the document, one can understand why NASA didn’t want to publicize it. The budget cancelled missions and programs right and left to achieve the $6 billion in cuts from the agency’s 2025 budget of about $24.9 billion.', 'Those cuts were most visible in science. According to The Planetary Society, 41 individual projects, both standalone missions and contributions to other missions, are slated for termination in the 2026 budget proposal. They range from Mars Sample Return (MSR), the multibillion-dollar program that the skinny budget already disclosed would be canceled, to many ongoing missions in extended phases whose annual budgets are in the low millions of dollars each.', '“It’s generally pretty much what we expected,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, said in an interview shortly after the release of the budget. That was based on the overall budget reductions for science included in the skinny budget, which slashed science spending by 47% from 2025.', 'The skinny budget had listed only two missions, MSR and Landsat Next, for termination (Landsat Next, the document said, would be restructured in some way to lower its costs, with work continuing another line item.) The detailed budget showed how far-reaching the proposed cuts were,', 'Some of the missions slated for cancellation are large, like the Earth System Observatory line of missions, still largely in early phases of development. Also cancelled was the Astrophysics Probe program, also in its early phases now—NASA selected two concepts for further study last year—but which would have a full cost of about $1 billion.', 'The budget, released almost four years after NASA selected two Venus missions in its latest Discovery program competition, DAVINCI and VERITAS, would cancel them both. It would also cancel NASA’s contribution to EnVision, a European Space Agency mission to Venus launching around the same time.', 'However, small missions in development also got the axe, like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager as well as Ultraviolet Explorer missions in astrophysics. It also seeks to cancel NASA’s role in ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover mission to Mars, where NASA offered to provide thrusters for the landing platform, radioisotope heating units and a launch to replace components that Roscosmos had provided.', 'A wide range of missions already operating and in their extended phases would be terminated in the budget. The biggest of them is the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which a year ago NASA was considering budget cuts that astronomers warned were tantamount to cancellation. The new budget simply zeroes out the budget for Chandra. The Hubble Space Telescope would continue, but with some modest funding cuts.', 'The scale of those terminations surprised even Dreier. “I’d say some of the surprises were things like MAVEN, Juno, New Horizons; these really unique and arguably infrastructure-related assets,” he said. MAVEN, a Mars orbiter, is also used as a communications relay. Also terminated in the budget proposal is OSIRIS-APEX, the extension of the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission that will go to the asteroid Apophis just after its close Earth flyby in 2029.', 'He was also surprised that the budget would effectively end NASA support of plutonium-238 production needed for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and heating units. “The argument is that we no longer need a presence in the outer solar system, so we don’t need plutonium any more,” he said.', 'There was one bit of good news for science in the budget. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which leaked budget documents in April suggested would be terminated, is funded in the budget. However, it does do at a lower level than projected: $156.6 million for fiscal year 2025, versus a projected $376.5 million that NASA said last year the mission would need in 2026 as it worked towards a launch as soon as the fall of 2026.', '“NASA is actively evaluating cost-saving strategies and identifying schedule optimization opportunities to enable the mission to proceed with this reduced funding level,” the budget document said. But Dreier noted that the spacecraft is now nearly complete, with most of its overall budget already spent: “Cutting it in half and expecting to save money, that doesn’t make sense.”', 'Many of the other reductions in the NASA budget had already been telegraphed in the skinny budget: ending SLS and Orion after Artemis 3, cancelling the Gateway, potentially reducing the size of crew on the International Space Station, and slashing many space technology programs.', 'The skinny budget had hinted at new investments in Mars technology, and the budget does more than $1 billion for projects associated with human Mars exploration. That amount includes $200 million mission for “a near-term entry, descent, and landing demonstration for a human-class Mars lander” and another $200 million for commercial payload deliveries to Mars. The budget documents, though, provide few specifics about those new initiatives: the section on new Mars technology investments is less than a page.', 'The budget includes $864 million for a new “Commercial Moon to Mars (M2M) Infrastructure and Transportation Program”. That would go towards developing a commercial system to replace SLS/Orion as well as early work on “a space suit appropriate for use by astronauts on the Martian surface.” The program will also fund lunar and Martian relay satellites and be the new home of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, currently hosted by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.', 'With all those cuts come job reductions. A table tucked away in the back of the 462-page budget document notes that NASA has 17,391 civil servants in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2026, that would fall by a third, to 11,853. Some field centers would see even larger cuts: the Goddard Space Flight Center would lose nearly 50% of its civil servant workforce, while the Ames Research Center would lose nearly 40%.', 'The document, though, says little about those cuts. It makes only passing references to “workforce impacts” and “workforce reshaping efforts” without discussing how they would be implemented.', 'The budget proposal will likely face strong opposition from Congress. Some members, primarily Democrats, have criticized the budget. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement Monday. “Republicans need to join Democrats in fighting for the programs they once supported, and their communities thrive on.”', ""“We've heard from Republican offices that this is dead on arrival, absolutely deader than dead on arrival,” Dreier said."", 'For about 24 hours, the budget proposal appeared to be the first major challenge for NASA’s expected next administrator, Jared Isaacman.

By the end of this week, most expected Isaacman to be sworn in.', 'He would have faced strong questions about how much he supported this budget proposal, which would now be his. He had deflected questions about potential budget cuts during his confirmation process, stating that he was not involved in its development, but noted that a potential cut of neatly 50% to NASA science “does not appear to be an optimal outcome.” Did he still believe that now that he was running the agency and handed a budget with such a massive cut?', 'We won’t find out. While there had been no public issues that threatened his nomination, on Saturday afternoon Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist with some influence on the Trump Administration, posted that “Deep State operatives are trying to derail President Trump’s NASA Administrator pick” ahead of the confirmation vote, suggesting it was an effort to drive a wedge between Musk, who had lobbied for Isaacman to be nominated, and President Trump.', 'Within hours, the White House confirmed that Isaacman was out. “It’s essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement.', 'That statement, though, gave no reason for why the White House was withdrawing the nomination, and even left open the chance that Isaacman had decided to withdraw.', 'Trump provided a few more details later Saturday evening. “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” he stated.', 'Those “prior associations” were not identified, but appear to be a reference to Isaacman’s past donations to Democratic candidates and party offices. Those donations, though, were publicly known for months, which led to speculation again that the decision was linked to fraying ties between Trump and Musk, as the latter exited his formal role in the administration just a day earlier.', 'Whatever the reason, the decision leaves NASA without a permanent leader just as it faces the steepest budget cuts in its history. That has demoralized the agency’s workforce and sent shock waves of concern through the rest of the space community.', 'Isaacman “ran into the kind of politics that is damaging our country. Republicans and Democrats supported him as the right guy at the right time for the top job at NASA, but it wasn’t enough,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), himself a former astronaut, in a post Monday. “It’s incredibly frustrating that this administration did this to him and his family but I know he’s not done yet and he has a lot left to offer space exploration and our nation.”', 'Isaacman himself took the high road in his own online comments about the withdrawal, saying the six months since Trump announced his intent to nominate Isaacman “have been enlightening and, honestly, a bit thrilling.” He added, “I’ll always be grateful for this opportunity and cheering on our President and NASA as they lead us on the greatest adventure in human history.”', 'But right now, few other people are cheering on NASA as the one-two punch of the budget cuts and withdrawn nomination create a dark mood unlike any seen at NASA outside of spaceflight tragedies.

"Concede the moon to China if NASA cuts happen, Huntsville chamber warns",https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2025/06/huntsville-chamber-warns-america-would-concede-the-moon-to-china-if-nasa-cuts-happen.html,"['', 'A Texas senator’s pushback on President Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to NASA has gained an ally in the Rocket City.', 'The Huntsville/Madison County Chamber released a statement Friday supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is seeking $10 billion in additional funding for key NASA centers and programs.', 'Trump’s budget proposal would phase out two key programs run from Huntsville’s Marshall Space Flight Center: the Space Launch System that is to carry crews into lunar orbit for NASA’s Artemis program, and its Orion crew capsule.', 'Cruz proposed the additional spending in his role as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. He called for almost $10 billion “to win the new space race with China and ensure America dominates space” by making “targeted, critical investments in Mars-forward technology, Artemis Missions and Moon to Mars program, and the International Space Station.”', 'The Huntsville Chamber stressed that the SLS and Orion is the only system that has successfully flown to the moon and back – during Artemis 1 in 2022 – and thus is the nation’s best bet to establish a permanent presence there before China does.', '“Unless the U.S. is willing to concede the Moon to the Chinese, it is imperative that we continue to fund and support this program until such time as an alternative exists,” the statement read.', 'The Senate is working toward a version of Trump’s tax and spending plan for next year after the House narrowly passed its own version last month. Cruz’s proposal is advisory only, and Trump’s proposal already faces opposition from senators concerned about spending. A recent nonpartisan budget analysis predicted the House version would raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years.', 'Cruz, though, is a leading Senate voice on space who represents another state where NASA has a large presence. The Lunar Gateway – also on the chopping block in Trump’s proposal – is run out of Houston’s Johnson Space Center.', 'Meanwhile, Marshall is NASA’s lead center for SLS, managing the booster, engines, stages, and integration. Major Huntsville aerospace contractors including Boeing, Dynetics, Aerojet Rocketdyne, United Launch Alliance and Teledyne Brown Engineering contribute to the development, production and operation of the SLS’s various elements, AL.com has reported.', 'A 2024 study found Alabama enjoyed $5.1 billion in economic impact due to NASA’s Artemis-related work -- more than any other state. It attributed much of that to the reach of Marshall Space Flight Center and the contracting it oversees.', 'Cruz is calling for SLS and Orion to be funded at least through the Artemis V mission, scheduled to launch no sooner than 2030. Trump’s budget calls for them to be replaced by unspecified private industry solutions after Artemis 3 in 2027.', 'Orion is the program’s only crew capsule and SLS its only launch vehicle.', '', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

'What a waste:' US scientists decry Trump's 47% cuts to NASA science budget,https://www.space.com/space-exploration/what-a-waste-us-scientists-decry-trumps-47-percent-cuts-to-nasa-science-budget,"['""I don\'t think it is an overstatement to say that morale among U.S.-based scientists is at an all-time low.""', '', 'Since January, when President Donald Trump took office for the second time, the White House has been asking U.S. government organizations to implement some pretty radical changes. Things have been tense, to say the least. Thousands of federal workers have been laid off with little explanation, programs that improve diversity in the workplace have been eliminated, research grants have been cancelled in large sweeps, and international college students find themselves at risk of losing their legal status.', 'One government organization that could be hit the hardest is NASA.', ""The agency has faced a particularly extensive amount of pressure from the Trump administration: surveillance, goal restructuring, website purging and more. Other federal science organizations haven't been spared, either — places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have been targeted as well. The ground of U.S. science seems to be quaking for political reasons rather than scientific ones, leaving scientists disheartened by their government and anxious about what's next."", '""I don\'t think it is an overstatement to say that morale among U.S.-based scientists is at an all-time low,"" Sarah Horst, an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at The Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, told Space.com. ""People are afraid for their jobs, their students, the projects they\'ve often spent decades working on, and they are afraid for the future of the United States.""', ""And things only got worse on May 30, when the Trump administration's fiscal year 2026 budget request for NASA came out. It proposes cutting the agency's science funding by 47%, and the agency's workforce by about one-third — from 17,391 to 11,853. This budget has to be officially passed by Congress to take effect, but if it indeed does, the effects could be brutal."", '""That would represent the smallest NASA workforce since mid-1960, before the first American had launched into space,"" Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit exploration and advocacy organization, told Space.com.', '""If this budget is made real, I am most concerned about people,"" John O\'Meara, chief scientist at the Keck Observatory, told Space.com. ""Missions deliver data and are essential, but the data is meaningless without the people there to interpret it, test theories and share discoveries with the world.""', 'Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!', ""Perhaps the most striking aspect of the White House's 2026 NASA budget proposal is the sheer amount of missions it would cancel altogether: 41 projects, as the Planetary Society said in a statement denouncing the report."", '""This is the extinction-level event we were warning people about,"" Dreier said.', ""Some specifics: The sharply reduced budget would cancel the Mars Sample Return (MSR) program, which was meant to bring samples of the Red Planet's surface to Earth — samples that NASA's Perseverance rover has been dutifully collecting over the last few years, and which scientists have long stressed must be analyzed in a lab to reach their full potential."", ""MSR has experienced its own share of complications since its genesis, to be fair, including a huge price tag and what some believe is an overcomplicated mechanism of sample retrieval. However, cancelling the project outright instead of coming up with a solution would waste much of Perseverance's work on the Red Planet."", ""The OSIRIS-APEX mission (you may remember it by its previous moniker, OSIRIS-REx) would also be cut off. This mission successfully sent a spacecraft on a multi-billion-mile expedition to an asteroid named Bennu, then had it grab a few pieces of the asteroid before traveling all the way back to Earth and safely dropping the samples to the ground. This same probe is now on round two, headed to examine the infamous asteroid Apophis — but if the FY26 NASA budget is confirmed, it won't complete its trip."", '', '""I\'m personally mostly concerned for in-flight missions that already have a significant investment in both taxpayer dollars and peoples\' lives/careers (including my own),"" Kevin McGill, an employee at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the agency\'s lead center for robotic planetary exploration, told Space.com. ""Luckily, my work on [the Curiosity Mars rover] and Mars2020 [Perseverance] are mostly safe, but a lot of other stuff isn\'t.""', ""The budget also suggests ceasing operations for the Jupiter-orbiting Juno spacecraft, which has been circling our solar system's gas giant since 2016 while regularly delivering rich information about the world and its moons. Juno is responsible for all those swirly blue images of Jupiter the astronomy community holds high; it took five years for this spacecraft to get to where it is, and many more for it to be built in the first place."", '""The operating missions cancellations alone represent over $12 billion of invested taxpayer value — and once they\'re gone, they\'re gone. It would take years and many millions more to replace them,"" Dreier said.', '', 'NASA would also need to pull out of its collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) on the Rosalind Franklin rover — for the second time, no less — which is a robotic life-hunting explorer set to launch toward Mars in 2028. NASA had to pull out in 2012 because of budget cuts as well but re-entered the rover program after ESA cut ties with its other partner, the Russian space agency Roscosmos, once Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. ""This makes the U.S. an untrustworthy partner and our allies hesitate the next time we ask them for help,"" Dreier said.', 'Two operational Mars orbiters — Mars Odyssey and MAVEN — would be cancelled as well, as would the New Horizons spacecraft currently studying the outer reaches of the solar system and the DaVinci and VERITAS missions, which would explore Venus. The Lunar Gateway, which NASA envisioned as a sort of International Space Station around the moon, would also be cancelled.', '""What was surprising was the level of cuts within parts of each of the agencies. An example is astrophysics, where the cut was nearly 2/3 of the astrophysics budget,"" O\'Meara said.', ""According to the Planetary Society's analysis of the budget, that huge astrophysics reduction could mean eight spacecraft dedicated to studying extreme events in the universe (think, the Chandra X-ray Observatory) would be terminated. This analysis also suggests 10 missions constructed to study the region around Earth and the sun would be cancelled, as well as about a dozen Earth-specific missions that help scientists forecast natural disasters such as hurricanes and track global warming."", 'The latter is especially concerning, given the speed with which Earth is heating up due to human activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions — activities the Trump administration favors, such as burning coal for cheap power. Per the budget proposal, the White House also wants NASA to eliminate its ""green aviation"" spending, dedicated to making airplanes better for the environment, and instead work on ""protecting the development of technologies with air traffic control and defense applications.""', '', ""It is also worth considering that other Trump-mandated moves have heavily impacted climate initiatives as well: more than 800 NOAA workers were laid off, for example, and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which houses climate change records dating back to the 1800s, was closed down — leading members of NASA's largest union to speak out in solidarity with their coworkers."", 'Hundreds of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, a huge report that details the dangers of climate change for policymakers to lean on, were also dismissed. (That represented all of the authors of this report).', '""This budget request, and its implications, has been highly disruptive to the entire field,"" O\'Meara said. ""We are forced to focus on \'what-if\' planning that changes in scope rapidly. That takes the time away from what we do best: doing science and sharing it with the world.""', ""Furthermore, the White House's FY26 NASA budget proposal centers around a shift toward human missions to the Red Planet; this was a rare area that saw a budget boost in the President's request."", 'For example, one slide in the budget summary says NASA should invest ""more than $1 billion in new technology investments to enable a crewed mission to Mars."" Another says the agency should allocate ""$200M for Commercial Mars Payload Services (CMPS) to start launching robotic precursor missions to the Martian surface, and $80M to start deploying communications relay capabilities for Mars.""', '""It just bothers me that they are changing almost the entirety of NASA\'s mission to this pipe dream of a human mission to Mars in any reasonable time frame and cost,"" McGill said.', ""Space.com reached out to NASA for comment on the possible impact of these budget cuts, and was directed to acting administrator Janet Petro's statement in the proposal's Technical Supplement. This statement is supportive of the budget request overall, mentioning items such as a renewed push for human spaceflight to the moon and Mars."", '""The President\'s Fiscal Year 2026 Budget Request for NASA reflects the Trump-Vance Administration\'s commitment to strengthening America\'s leadership in space exploration while exercising fiscal responsibility. With this budget, we aim to shape a Golden Age of innovation and exploration,"" it reads.', '', ""This shift toward Mars crewed missions is perhaps predictable, given Trump's affiliation with SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk. (Former affiliation, maybe, given the heated feud currently unfolding on social media between the two.)"", 'Musk was a prominent backer of Trump\'s campaign and worked very closely with him over the past four months. For example, the SpaceX chief ran the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), which was responsible for the bulk of government funding cuts in the name of saving ""wasted taxpayer money."" Independently, Musk has earned a reputation as maybe the most outspoken advocate of settling Mars, even going so far as to say he wishes to ""die on Mars."" SpaceX, as well as its fans, are extremely focused on achieving that goal.', '""In isolation, a serious humans to Mars campaign should be exciting — Mars exploration is a worthy goal, and The Planetary Society has advocated for that for years,"" Dreier said. ""But the cost here is too high.""', 'Another concern Dreier has is that the White House expects to achieve this major goal while simultaneously reducing NASA\'s workforce at an unprecedented rate. ""This isn\'t just poor policy,"" he added. ""It\'s fundamentally wasteful and inefficient, exactly what this administration is saying it does not want.""', 'And the layoffs could be even more far-reaching than anticipated.', ""McGill says morale at JPL had already been very low after sweeping layoffs took place last year, but also that the energy was further damaged by the agency's recent return-to-office order. For context, nearly 5,500 JPL employees who have been working remotely since the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic were told they must return to in-person work. The deadlines for that return were Aug. 25 for general employees within California and Oct. 27 for teleworkers living outside the state."", '""Employees who do not return by their required date will be considered to have resigned,"" JPL officials said in a workforce-wide email that was obtained by Space.com.', '""It\'s clear that it\'s a silent layoff of the over 1,000 remote employees who they don\'t want to pay severance to,"" a NASA employee at JPL not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency previously told Space.com.', 'McGill says the order ""threatens to decimate the workforce and a lot of critical institutional knowledge.""', '""I love JPL and its mission, but it\'s been a rough time as of late,"" he said.', '', ""According to Dreier, there's good news and bad news concerning whether the budget proposal will go through. The good news is that, as he explains, there seems to be bipartisan dislike for the proposal."", '""We\'ve heard directly from multiple congressional offices — Republican and Democrat — that this budget is \'dead on arrival,\'"" he said.', ""Of note, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation released his legislative directives for Senate Republicans' budget reconciliation bill on Friday (June 6). The senator proposes dedicating $10 billion more to NASA's science programs — and, though most of it is indeed in line with the FY26 budget request's Mars endeavors, some of that funding would be used for other things, like NASA Space Launch System (SLS) rocket meant for moon exploration and Lunar Gateway."", ""This united aversion to the budget proposal is unsurprising. The bipartisan U.S. Planetary Science Caucus, for instance, previously released a statement in response to early blueprints of the proposal that suggested the huge cuts we're seeing presented now."", '""We are extremely alarmed by reports of a preliminary White House budget that proposes cutting NASA Science funding by almost half and terminating dozens of programs already well underway, like the Mars Sample Return mission and the Roman Space Telescope,"" co-chairs Rep. Judy Chu (D-California) and Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) wrote.', ""Such agreement across the aisle makes sense when we consider how long it takes for space missions to reach fruition. Collaboration isn't just key — it's unavoidable."", '""Spaceflight, and human spaceflight in particular, requires hand-off from one administration to another,"" Dreier said. ""The timelines are just too long for any one presidential administration.""', 'The bad news, however, is the White House may have a workaround.', ""— 'This is an attack on NASA.' Space agency's largest union speaks out as DOGE cuts shutter science institute located above 'Seinfeld' diner in NYC"", ""— Saving Gateway, SLS and Orion? Sen. Ted Cruz proposes $10 billion more for NASA's moon and Mars efforts"", ""— 'Their loss diminishes us all': Scientists emphasize how Trump's mass NOAA layoffs endanger the world"", '""Even if Congress ultimately rejects this budget, the slow pace of legislation and gridlock we\'ve seen in recent years make it unlikely that appropriations will be in place by October 1st of this year,"" Dreier said. ""If there\'s another continuing resolution, the White House budget office will throttle spending to match the lowest of all possible budget scenarios: theirs. So, we face the possibility of these cuts going into effect by default. Given the breadth and depth of these cuts, that could be very hard to recover from.""', '""This budget proposal threatens to tear down that carefully constructed coalition in favor of a narrow vision that lacks the political durability necessary for long-term success,"" he added.', '""What a waste.""', ""The White House's FY26 budget request for NASA was released on May 30."", 'Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

Trump’s NASA cuts would destroy decades of science and wipe out its future,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-09/trumps-nasa-cuts-would-destroy-decades-of-science-and-wipe-out-its-future,"['Like all sponsors of science programs, NASA has had its ups and downs. What makes it unique is that its achievements and failures almost always happen in public.', 'Triumphs like the moon landings and the deep-space images from the Hubble and Webb space telescopes were great popular successes; the string of exploding rockets in its early days and the shuttle explosions cast lasting shadows over its work.', 'But the agency may never have had to confront a challenge like the one it faces now: a Trump administration budget plan that would cut funding for NASA’s science programs by nearly 50% and its overall spending by about 24%.', 'This is us metaphorically closing our eyes.', '— Casey Dreier, Planetary Society, on proposed NASA budget cuts', 'The budget, according to insiders, was prepared without significant input from NASA itself. That’s not surprising, because the agency doesn’t have a formal leader.', 'On May 31 Donald Trump abruptly pulled the nomination as NASA administrator of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur, space enthusiast, and two-time crew member on private space flights, apparently because of his ties to Elon Musk. The withdrawal came only days before a Senate confirmation vote on Isaacman’s appointment.', 'Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik', 'Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', 'While awaiting a new nominee, “NASA will continue to have unempowered leadership, not have a seat at the table for its own destiny and not be able to effectively fight for itself in this administration,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a leading research advocacy organization.', 'Things haven’t been helped by the sudden breakup between Trump and Musk, whose SpaceX is a major contractor for NASA and the Department of Defense, the relationship with which is now in doubt.', 'The cuts, Dreier says, reduce NASA’s budget to less than it has been, accounting for inflation, since the earliest days of Project Mercury in the early 1960s.', 'Superficially, the budget cuts place heightened emphasis on “practical, quantitative,” even commercial applications, Dreier told me. Programs transmitting weather data from satellites, valued by farmers, remain funded, but studies of climate change and other studies of Earth science are slashed. Astrophysics and other aspects of space exploration also are eviscerated, with 19 projects that are already operating destined for cancellation.', '(The Hubble and Webb space telescopes, which thrill the world with the quality and drama of their transmitted images, are spared significant cuts.)', 'The budget cuts will undermine the administration’s professed goals. That’s because many of the scientific projects on the chopping block provide knowledge needed to advance those goals.', '', 'The proposed budget does include two longer-term scientific goals endorsed by Trump — a return of astronauts to the moon via a project dubbed Artemis, and the landing of a crew on Mars.', 'The highly ambitious Artemis timeline anticipates a crewed landing in late 2027 or early 2028. As for the Mars landing, that goal faces so many unsolved technical obstacles that it has no practical timeline at this moment. (Doubts about its future may have deepened due to the sudden rift between Trump and the Mars project’s leading advocate, Elon Musk.)', 'The administration’s approach to NASA involves a weirdly jingoistic notion of the primacy of American science, akin to the administration’s description of its chaotic tariff policies.', 'Trump has said he wants the U.S. to dominate space: “America will always be the first in space,” he said during his first term. “We don’t want China and Russia and other countries leading us. We’ve always led.”', 'Vice President JD Vance recently told an interviewer on Newsmax that “the American Space Program, the first program to put a human being on the surface of the moon, was built by American citizens. ... This idea that American citizens don’t have the talent to do great things, that you have to import a foreign class of servants, I just reject that.”', 'Among the “foreign class of servants,” whom Vance acknowledged included “some German and Jewish scientists” who came to the U.S. after World War II, was the single most important figure in the space program — Wernher von Braun, a German engineer who had helped the Nazis develop the V-2 rocket bomb (using Jewish slave labor) and who was recruited by the U.S. military after the war. The lunar rover that allowed astronauts to traverse the moon’s surface was developed by the Polish-born Mieczyslaw G. Bekker and Ferenc Pavlics, a Hungarian.', '', 'The human exploration of space, its advocates say, could cement America’s relationship with its scientific allies. No mission on the scale of a return to the moon or a manned voyage to Mars could conceivably be brought off by the U.S. acting alone, much less by a Republican administration alone or within the time frame of practical politics. These are long-term projects that require funding and scientific know-how on a global scale.', 'Because of the relationship between the Martian and Earth orbits, for instance, Mars launches can only be scheduled for two-month windows every 26 months. That necessitates building partisan and international consensuses, which appear elusive in Trumpworld, in order to keep the project alive through changes in political control of the White House and Congress.', '“Celestial mechanics and engineering difficulties don’t work within convenient electoral cycles,” Dreier observes. In this White House, however, “there’s no awareness that the future will exist beyond this presidency.”', 'A representative of the White House did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Trump’s assault on NASA science and especially on NASA Earth science is nothing new. Republicans have consistently tried to block NASA research on global warming.', 'In 1999, the Clinton administration fought against a $1-billion cut in the agency’s Earth science budget pushed by the House GOP majority. (Congress eventually rejected the cut.) During the first Trump term, the pressure on Earth science came from the White House, while Trump dismissed global warming as a “hoax.” He wasn’t very successful — during his term, NASA’s budget rose by about 17%.', 'Characteristically for this administration, the proposed cuts make little sense even on their own terms. Programs that superficially appear to be pure science but that provide data crucial for planning the missions to the moon and Mars are being terminated.', 'WORLD & NATION', '', 'Among them is Mars Odyssey, a satellite that reached its orbit around the red planet in late 2001 and has continued to map the surface and send back information about atmospheric conditions — knowledge indispensable for safe landings. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, which reached Mars orbit in 2014, has provided critical data about its upper atmosphere for 10 years.', 'In fiscal terms, the budget cuts are penny-wise and galactically foolish. The costs of space exploration missions are hugely front-loaded, with as much as 90% or 95% consumed in planning, spacecraft design and engineering and launch.', 'Once the crafts have reached their destinations and start transmitting data, their operational costs are minimal. The New Horizons spacecraft, launched in 2006 to explore the outer limits of the Solar System (it reached Pluto in 2016 and is currently exploring other distant features of the system), cost $781 million for development, launch, and the first years of operation. Keeping it running today by receiving its transmitted data and making sure it remains on course costs about $14.7 million a year, or less than 2% of its total price tag.', 'Terminating these projects now, therefore, means squandering billions of dollars in sunk costs already borne by taxpayers. Exploratory spacecraft can take 10 years or more to develop and require the assemblage of teams of trained engineers, designers, and other professionals.', 'Then there’s the lost opportunity to nurture new generations of scientists. The proposed budget shatters the assumption that those who devote 10 or 15 years to their science education will have opportunities awaiting them at the far end to exploit and expand upon what they’ve learned.', '', 'The deepest mystery about the proposed budget cuts is who drafted them. Circumstantial evidence points to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and the main author of Project 2025, the infamous right-wing blueprint for the Trump administration.', 'NASA doesn’t appear in Project 2025 at all. It does, however, appear in a purportedly anti-woke 2022 budget proposal Vought published through his right-wing think tank, the Center for Renewing America. In that document, he called for a 50% cut in NASA’s science programs, especially what Vought called its “misguided ... Global Climate Change programs,” and a more than 15% cut in the overall NASA budget.', 'The 47% cut in science programs and 24% overall is “very suspiciously close to what Vought said he would do” in 2022, Dreier says. I asked the White House to comment on Vought’s apparent fingerprints on the NASA budget plan, but received no reply.', 'The abrupt termination of Isaacman’s candidacy for NASA administrator is just another blow to the agency’s prospects for survival. The space community, which saw Isaacman as a political moderate committed to NASA’s institutional goals, was cautiously optimistic about his nomination.', '“Someone who had the perceived endorsement of the president and the power to execute, would be in a position if not to change the budget numbers themselves, but to take a smart, studied and effective route to figure out how to make the agency work better with less money,” Dreier told me. That may have been wishful thinking, he acknowledged. No replacement has yet been nominated, but “I don’t think anyone is thinking this is going to be a better outcome for the space agency, whoever Trump nominates,” Dreier says.', 'The consequences of all this amount to an existential crisis for NASA and American space science. They may never recover from the shock. The void will be filled by others, such as China, which could hardly be Trump’s dream.', 'At the end of our conversation, I asked Dreier what will become of the 19 satellites and space telescopes that would be orphaned by the proposed budget.', '“You turn off the lights and they just tumble into the blackness of space,” he told me. “It’s easy to lose a spacecraft.

Where Is Space Tech Headed Under the Trump Administration?,https://www.designnews.com/aerospace/where-is-space-tech-headed-under-the-trump-administration-,"['Proposed US government budget cuts for space science and exploration could impact the aerospace industry, but military and commercial missions may offer other prospects.', 'June 10, 2025', 'Experts in space tech discussed the future of US space missions during a panel discussion at Space Tech Expo USA 2025. Panelists shared concerns about proposed US government budget cuts to NASA and NOAA for science and exploration as well as shifting priorities in President Donald Trump’s administration. However, panelists said those shifts may also present opportunities for aerospace companies that can meet the needs of increasing military and commercial demands.', '“One of the key issues was announced last week with the federal budget being released and a major shift in civil space policy. Basically, as I interpret it, the US is getting out of space exploration and space science—both of those areas are being greatly diminished in the proposed budget for FY 2026,” said Louis Friedman, cofounder and executive director emeritus, The Planetary Society, during the June 3 panel, Trump 2.0: Key Priorities and Urgent Policies for a Thriving Space Ecosystem. “In addition, space technology support in NASA and government support [are] being cut in half as part of the space policy.”', 'Friedman served as moderator of the panel. Joining him were Alyson Decker, a lawyer specializing in space law and policy with Taylor | Anderson LLP; Steven Jordan Tomaszewski, VP of space systems for the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA); Mark Bitterman, vice president of government affairs, Portal Space Systems; and Matthew Harris, space focus area lead, QinetiQ US, and an adjunct professor of Embry-Riddle.', 'Related:Advancing Functional Coating Applications for Aerospace & Defense Projects', 'Tomaszewski explained that President Trump’s “skinny budget” that dropped a few weeks ago had “big proposed cuts to NASA and NOAA and also a flat line of the Department of Defense budget,” and then more details on the NASA cuts came out with the FY 2026 budget proposal. “All attention now is going to Congress. We’ve seen some good initial support for civil space coming from Congress, with the Senate’s release of the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2025,” he said. “But it’s going to be a long slog over the summer.”', 'Decker told the audience that “there is a general uncertainty right now” in the industry, citing factors such as a lack of a NASA administrator and “tariffs that are on again, off again.”', '“These are all things that are constantly affecting our supply chains and the decisions we make. And this is a problem because this industry in particular is one that plans years in advance. Missions take years to build—to get from conception to launch can be sometimes, 5, 10 years, even more,” she said. “It’s really hard when you are in that kind of industry and things are changing constantly.', '“But one thing we can all agree on that we expect from this administration is that there’s going to be a reduction in pure science, so purely scientific missions are getting cut, and there is a focus more on missions with commercial and military applications,” she said. Aerospace companies that can pivot their businesses toward these projects may find new opportunities.', 'The US appears to be getting out of Mars exploration and diminishing its role on the moon, just as China is getting into both, said Friedman. He also noted “major cuts” to or “cancellation” of almost all cooperative programs with Europe. ', 'He added that China is intent on advancing its own programs, pointing to China’s development of its lunar research station. ', 'Decker said that while no country can own any part of the moon or celestial space, a country can control the area they occupy. “That’s the concern if China gets there first—will they take control of areas that have the most resources that we might need on the moon?” she asked.', 'Bitterman of Portal Space Systems added that “China’s intentions are clear about getting to the moon and planting a flag. It is unclear what that might mean for national security, but I think it’s safe to say there are national security objectives behind what the PRC intends to do.”', 'Panelists were also concerned about the US stepping away from cooperative missions with other countries. “China is also trying to get its own international partnerships going,” said Tomaszewski of AIA. “With the proposed cuts right now to NASA and civil space, it would be detrimental not only for the current programs in development and future ambitions but also sends a signal that America isn’t a great partner.” He added further: “If the proposed cuts hold up, they could jeopardize long-standing strategic international partnerships and relationships. . . . And I think China is trying to point out that we aren’t reliable as a partner.”', 'Harris later said: “If we show we aren’t a valued, trusted partner, they may go—they may not—but they have more of an inclination to get pushed toward other players. We see this in the Arab states and in Africa and some of Europe moving toward the China orbit—pun intended—and we don’t know where that will end up.”', 'Harris also emphasized the importance of US infrastructure development in space, potentially deep space. “The beauty about doing infrastructure and that the US would own it, and I’ve spoken before about the China threat, if we don’t do it, somebody else will, and we don’t want, at least in my opinion, the alternative norms and rules of the road—we would want American or Western ideals. And by doing it also, we bring along these international partners.” Opportunities include both hardware and ongoing services.', 'However, Decker sees in the administration a “step back from the soft power that we used to develop through the aerospace community,” she said, adding that she doesn’t think the “Golden Dome will be a cooperative moment for anything. I think it’s going to be American focused and American centric and militarized, parts of space at least. I see that we are going to probably have a step back from international cooperations we’ve seen. I think you’re going to see a lot of focus on trying to source things more within the country and make it harder to have these joint missions or launching from other places or switching components or technologies across countries, unfortunately.”', 'Harris also lamented the missed opportunity of deploying dual-use hardware. “So, what you could have put up there as part of a peaceful commercial civilian [mission] could also have had a deterring effect for space situational awareness and space traffic management” and could have included “payloads that could help make sure there are no bad actors but also then manage if there is a proliferation of spacecraft going to the moon and beyond,” he said. “So, it is a lost opportunity not just for science but what you could do with that platform in the specific location.”', 'The hopeful news for the aerospace industry is that “the doors for military utilization of commercial assets [are] being thrown wide open,” Decker said. “Great examples are growth in Department of Defense SBIR and STTR programs.” For instance, “they want to be able to buy modified off-the-shelf satellites, and they want things done fast,” she said. “It’s a great opportunity for smaller businesses to get their foot in the door.”', 'Also, the Golden Dome program “will dump a ton of money into the aerospace industry,” she added. “It’s also planned to be multitiered, layered, and built from largely commercial components, so it’s another great opportunity for aerospace companies to get in on that.” Both hardware and software will be needed, she said.', 'Tomaszewski said that the “Golden Dome is going to be a golden opportunity for the national security space enterprise. And we are still getting details on what this will look like.” ', 'In terms of other drivers of space tech, Harris said that there might be asteroid mining, bioengineering, and even hotels. However, “no matter what you do . . . eventually someone might come over and contest it, so you need that authority or some kind of governmental aspect, whether it is regulatory or power.”', 'He added: “I think geopolitics can never be divorced from it, because it is human nature to always go to the next highest ground and vantage point.”', 'Decker’s advice for the industry? “Aerospace companies need to learn to pivot and take advantage of changing priorities,” she said.  ', '“Build flexibility into your contracts and look at what you can do in your pre-existing contracts to balance out increased costs from tariffs, decline of government budgets, and supply chain issues,” she added. “You also want to be able to market and sell what you have. So, what are the commercial, military, or ideological benefits of what you are building?”', 'In other words, “you have to learn to love the pivot,” she said. “Now isn’t the time to niche down—now is the time to think about what you can take that you have and repurpose it.” ', 'Friedman asked, “if these policies go into effect, what effect will they have on the country and on the space industry, because general government support has been a driver?”', 'He noted the many suppliers in the commercial space tech sector, particularly those at the show—but said: “There are many suppliers, but do we have many customers besides the government? That is the key question we will be facing.”', 'He acknowledged that increased military spending is budgeted, with the key priority being the Golden Dome. “But how will that take effect? There is a lot of uncertainty as to how and who will be involved,” he said. ', 'Decker later pointed out that the two space stations currently in orbit are “government space stations, and private space hasn’t been able to figure out a way to get there that’s commercially feasible yet. They might in the future—there is space tourism and some industry that’s being done in space particularly like pharmaceuticals or development of technology that isn’t safe to do on Earth, but there’s just not a humongous demand that’s justifying the cost that makes it a viable business model. There is still so much reliance on government,” Decker said.', 'The panelists agreed that space exploration may not be a top concern of the general public. “When you talk to people outside the aerospace industry, oftentimes they don’t know what’s going on,” Decker said. “We do need to find out how to get people more invigorated or excited.” ', 'Noting the public’s past interest in the Hubble and James Webb space telescope programs yet their diminishing interest in the International Space Station, Bitterman fears that “cuts in science are going to detract from the average American’s focus on space, and I think it could be very, very detrimental over the long haul in terms of excitement about space,” he said.', 'Harris suggested that there is a “value add” to space science and to missions with international partners in terms of relationship building, economic prosperity, and perhaps national security. “I wish we could tell the American people that there are benefits to science experiments besides just the science—it’s not just a waste of money—but there is other stuff we glean from it,” he said. ', 'When Friedman asked whether we are seeing the end of human space exploration, Tomaszewski of AIA said: “I don’t think that proposed cuts to NASA signal an end to human space exploration for the industry of the future, but I do think that it could risk having a long pause.”', 'He added that “it is very exciting to see some commercial entrants getting into human exploration and space tourism, and there is a lot of demand out there for folks interested in getting to space. But as we are looking at a post-International Space Station environment, you want to make sure with NASA’s new plan for commercial lower Earth orbit destinations that you have some consistency between those programs. You don’t want to deorbit the International Space Station early without having anything lined up to follow it. You risk having a gap like we’ve had in the past.”', 'Friedman closed the session by saying, “You heard a lot about uncertainty and about the profound changes proposed in space policy especially in space science and exploration areas but generally across the board that could have some serious effects on US position.”', 'Space Tech Expo USA 2026 will take place June 3-4, 2026, in Anaheim, CA.', 'Daphne Allen', 'Editor-in-Chief, Design News', 'Daphne Allen is editor-in-chief of Design News.

What’s ahead for NASA?",https://www.cfpublic.org/podcast/are-we-there-yet/2025-06-03/slashed-budget-uncertain-leadership-whats-ahead-for-nasa,"['This past weekend, the Trump administration withdrew its nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA Administrator. This sets back the nomination timeline by months, leaving NASA without a permanent leader.', 'The decision is reportedly political motivated and not related to Isaacman’s qualifications.', 'Eric Berger, senior space editor at Ars Technica, said the decision comes as a surprise. Isaacman had broad support inside NASA, had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charity for cancer research and it was clear he was making efforts to reach out both to the private and public space community.', ""“So, I think there's just general disappointment,” Berger said. “Both for the fact that Isaacman was well liked, kind of younger, energetic, and really was coming to NASA at a time when it needed to take step forward, to modernize.”"", 'Additionally, NASA now faces a new uncertainty with the Turmp administration’s budget request – and no leader to advocate strongly for NASA.', ""Berger spoke with Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, ahead of the ninth test flight of the company's Starship spacecraft about the mission."", ""“I got the sense that he realizes that Starship is this, you know, hugely ambitious problem to solve, and that there are going to be setbacks along the way,” Berger said. “And I suspect he was hoping for more than what happened with the test flight, but at the same time, I think there's a recognition that they've still got a lot to learn and a lot of problems to solve before they really get a rapidly reusable rocket.”"", 'Just last week, SpaceX launched its mega-rocket Starship on its ninth test flight. There is some concern considering there are some fundamental issues that still need to be fixed, and NASA is counting on Starship for future moon landings.', ""“I think SpaceX is going to kind of go its own way,” Berger said. “You know, they do not need funding from NASA like they did five, 10, or 15 years ago, to survive. They're going to continue to work with NASA, but my sense is that Elon is going to be in a mode where he's ready to show the world what SpaceX can do. “"", 'NASA could face a significant budget cut—approximately 25%—under a new request from the White House, if approved by Congress.', 'If implemented, the budget would cancel about a third of NASA’s science portfolio.', 'Multiple solar system exploration missions including Juno at Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and various Earth and Mars expeditions would be discontinued.', 'Casey Dreier, the Chief of Space Policy for The Planetary Society, a science advocacy organization, anticipates that every single future science mission, as well as further development, will be canceled under this budget.', ""“And then, of course, major ramping down, ending the SLS and Orion programs, canceling the gateway Space Station, ending NASA's Education Outreach Program entirely,” Dreier said. “And then roughly, laying off about a third of NASA's remaining workforce. That's staggering.”"", 'This budget is similar to the 1961 budget, when adjusted for inflation.', ""“You have broad cuts to education, you have broad cuts to science, you have cuts to aeronautics. No one is excited about this,” Dreier said. “But again, will that be enough to be able to offset this if Congress itself broadly, and it's not because people like or dislike this budget, but the broader political trends, if they're unable to act in some coherent manner.”"", 'For the agency, this budget cut makes the process of moving forward for future missions even more of a challenge. With no permanent leader and this significant cut, NASA will have to struggle to move forward through these changes.', '“NASA will be at the mercy in the whims of the Budget Office or whomever else is creating these ideas and giving it to the space agency and saying, make it work.”']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZhbDkxUVVwT1NGcDVVelZZVFJEVEF4aVJCU2dLTWdZQk1Kb01GZ3M=-w280-h168-p-df
NASA's FY 2026 Budget Request has been Released,https://www.universetoday.com/articles/nasas-fy-2026-budget-request-has-been-released,"[""It's official. NASA's Fiscal Year 2026 Discretionary Budget Request (FY 2026) has been released, and the news is decidedly mixed. In a previous article, we examined the FY 2026 Budget Request (released on May 2nd) and its recommendations for the coming year. With the release of the FY 2026 Budget, what was previewed and the anxiety it caused for many have been confirmed. While the Budget bolsters funding for NASA's exploration programs for the Moon and Mars, it also contains deep cuts to many other programs and the cancellation of key elements in NASA's Moon to Mars architecture."", 'In addition to reducing NASA\'s overall funding for the coming year, the Budget calls for the cancellation of the Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion spacecraft, and the Lunar Gateway. It also contains deep cuts for environmental science, education and outreach, advanced research, and other areas deemed as ""low-priority."" Lastly, the Budget contains significant cuts to NASA\'s workforce, its information technology services, NASA Centers, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities.', '', ""The Budget is detailed in a series of documents that are available on NASA's website. These include a copy of the FY 2026 Discretionary Budget Request, a Budget Request Summary, a Technical Supplement, an Agency Fact Sheet, and Mission Fact Sheets. The priorities are spelled out clearly, with an emphasis on returning astronauts to the Moon sooner than China and beating them to Mars. Streamlining the budget is also emphasized, as is transitioning mission elements and technology to commercial space."", 'To break it down, the Budget allocates $18.8 billion to NASA for fiscal year 2026, a reduction of $6 billion (or about 25%) from last year. This includes $8,312.9 million for Human Space Exploration, an increase of $646.7 million from last year. For Space Operations, the budget for FY 2026 is $3,131.9 million, a 35% reduction from FY 2025. This includes $920 million for the International Space Station (ISS), a reduction of $320.5 million (or 35%) from last year. Space Transportation faces similar cuts, with a reduction of $452.3 million (35%) from last year. Space and Flight Support (SFS) faces even deeper cuts, with a 55% reduction ($359.3 million).', 'Only Commercial LEO Development will see a $43.9 million boost in funding (19%) compared to FY 2025. The cuts are especially deep for Space Technology, which faces a reduction of almost half (48%). This reflects the current administration\'s proposed cancellation of advanced propulsion research, which it identified as ""better suited to private sector research and development."" The same is true for Science programs, which face overall cuts of about 47%. This is spread between Earth Science (cut by 52%), Planetary Science (31%), Astrophysics (~65%), Heliophysics (46%), and Biological and Physical Sciences (62%).', 'Only the STEM Engagement program faces cancellation, with a 100% cut to its funding. This was previewed in the Discretionary Request, which characterized the program as an example of ""woke STEM programming and research that prioritizes some groups of students over others and have had minimal impact on the aerospace workforce.""', 'Of the $8.3 billion allocated to Human Space Exploration, over $7 billion is earmarked for the Artemis Program and lunar exploration. This is subdivided into $4,894.6 million for the Moon to Mars Transportation System (a 2% increase), $2,815.4 million for Moon to Mars Systems Development (a 1.5% increase), and $602.9 million for Human Exploration Requirements & Architecture (a 640% increase). The Budget also specifies that the SLS, Orion, and Gateway will be retired after the Artemis III mission.', 'Returning astronauts to the Moon and ahead of China (which plans to land the first taikonauts there in 2030) is emphasized repeatedly. Beyond this, the goal is to transition the Artemis program ""to a more sustainable, cost-effective approach to lunar exploration"" by devoting funding to ""next-generation commercial systems."" In short, NASA is being directed to discontinue work on the key systems it has been working on since 2010 (or earlier) and outsource its lunar exploration plans to commercial developers.', '', 'The Budget similarly emphasizes the need to send astronauts to Mars ahead of China. allocates $1.13 billion for Mars-related technologies that will enable crewed exploration missions in the coming decade and after. This includes $120 million to continue robotic missions and instruments that will help prepare for crewed missions, $200 million to develop a near-term entry, descent, and landing (EDL) demonstration for a crewed Mars lander, and $350 million to accelerate the development of Mars-related technologies.', 'Other allocations include $50 million to lay the groundwork for space suits tailored to the Martian environment and $80 million to accelerate development of computers, surface communications, advanced surface power generation concepts, and technology development prizes. Another $250 million is allocated for starting commercial payload deliveries and commercial partnerships with industry for human transportation systems.', ""Whereas most of these allocations continue programs that have been in progress for more than a decade, the allocation of funding for payload deliveries and human transportation systems is reminiscent of NASA's commercial programs that target the Moon. There too, the Trump administration has always preferred outsourcing capabilities to commercial partners, mainly SpaceX. This includes the contract for the Starship HLS and the launch of the Lunar Gateway's core elements, which became necessary due to Artemis' expedited timetable."", ""This latest allocation is clearly intended to advance the development of the Starship * and similar technologies. Similarly, the boost in funding for Commercial LEO Development is likely motivated by the need to construct orbital refueling capabilities, which are essential to the Starship*'s mission profiles. This includes transporting astronauts to the Moon as part of Artemis III and IV, and sending passengers and payloads to Mars."", '', 'Under the new budget, over 40 ""lower-priority"" missions will be eliminated, including the Mars Sample Return (MSR) and the Landsat Next mission. The proposed cuts to Astrophysics led to trepidation that certain advanced science missions would also be cut. Luckily, the Budget stresses that ""high-impact missions"" are safe, which includes the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the venerable Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (RST).', 'Similarly, the Dragonfly mission that will depart in 2028 to explore Saturn’s moon Titan is safe, as is the NEO Surveyor mission that will begin detecting potential hazardous asteroids and comets to Earth no earlier than 2027.', '> To achieve these objectives, the Budget would streamline the NASA workforce, information technology services, NASA Center operations, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities. The Budget also terminates multiple unaffordable missions and reduces lower priority research, resulting in a leaner Science program that reflects a commitment to fiscal responsibility.', 'Further Reading:NASA', '© 2025 Universe Today', 'A space and astronomy news site', 'Support our ad-free content', 'This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZhbDkxUVVwT1NGcDVVelZZVFJEVEF4aVJCU2dLTWdZQk1Kb01GZ3M=-w280-h168-p-df

Trump wants to eliminate funding that keeps those tools operational.', 'Trump has proposed axing NASA’s Surface Geology and Biology mission, which monitors methane and carbon pollution but also hunts for and identifies deposits of critical minerals. Also endangered is NASA’s Landsat satellite program, which provides key data on water levels and distribution as well as the ways global warming is altering Earth.', '“Whether you believe in climate change or human-induced impacts on climate or not, these are atmospheric gases that have an impact on the composition of the Earth,” Richard Eckman, a veteran of NASA’s Earth Science Division, told Scott.', '“It’s very depressing to me to think that we’re writing off the future of NASA Earth Observing missions from space,” he said.', 'Eckman also questioned the proposal to cut fully functioning satellites already in orbit.

White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/proposed-federal-budget-would-devastate-u-s-space-science/,"['JUNE 3, 2025', '8 MIN READ', 'White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science', 'Scientists are rallying to reverse ruinous proposed cuts to both NASA and the National Science Foundation', 'BY NADIA DRAKE EDITED BY LEE BILLINGS', 'Fog shrouds the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in this photograph from February 25, 2025.', 'Gregg Newton/AFP via Getty', 'Late last week the Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for fiscal year 2026 —a request that, if enacted, would be the equivalent of carpet-bombing the national scientific enterprise.', '“This is a profound, generational threat to scientific leadership in the United States,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a science advocacy group. “If implemented, it would fundamentally undermine and potentially devastate the most unique capabilities that the U.S. has built up over a half-century.”', 'The Trump administration’s proposal, which still needs to be approved by Congress, is sure to ignite fierce resistance from scientists and senators alike. Among other agencies, the budget deals staggering blows to NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which together fund the majority of U.S. research in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics and Earth science —all space-related sciences that have typically mustered hearty bipartisan support.', 'The NSF supports ground-based astronomy, including such facilities as the Nobel Prize–winning gravitational-wave detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), globe-spanning arrays of radio telescopes, and cutting-edge observatories that stretch from Hawaii to the South Pole. The agency faces a lethal 57 percent reduction to its $9-billion budget, with deep cuts to every program except those in President Trump’s priority areas, which include artificial intelligence and quantum information science. NASA, which funds space-based observatories, faces a 25 percent reduction, dropping the agency’s $24.9-billion budget to $18.8 billion. The proposal beefs up efforts to send humans to the moon and to Mars, but the agency’s Science Mission Directorate —home to Mars rovers, the Voyager interstellar probes, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Space Telescope, and much more —is looking at a nearly 50 percent reduction, with dozens of missions canceled, turned off or operating on a starvation diet.', '“It’s an end-game scenario for science at NASA,” says Joel Parriott, director of external affairs and public policy at the American Astronomical Society. “It’s not just the facilities. You’re punching a generation-size hole, maybe a multigenerational hole, in the scientific and technical workforce. You don’t just Cryovac these people and pull them out when the money comes back. People are going to move on.”', 'Adding to the chaos, on Saturday President Trump announced that billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman was no longer his pick for NASA administrator—just days before the Senate was set to confirm Isaacman’s nomination. Initial reports—which have now been disputed—explained the president’s decision as stemming from his discovery that Isaacman recently donated money to Democratic candidates. Regardless of the true reason, the decision leaves both NASA and the NSF, whose director abruptly resigned in April, with respective placeholder “acting” leaders at the top. That leadership vacuum significantly weakens the agencies’ ability to fight the proposed budget cuts and advocate for themselves. “What’s more inefficient than a rudderless agency without an empowered leadership?” Dreier asks.', 'MICHAEL L. WONG', 'LEONARD DAVID & LEE BILLINGS', 'LOUIS FRIEDMAN', 'NADIA DRAKE', 'During his second administration, President Trump has repeatedly celebrated U.S. leadership in space. When he nominated Isaacman last December, Trump noted “NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration” and looked to a future of “groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology and exploration.” More recently, while celebrating Hubble’s 35th anniversary in April, Trump called the telescope “a symbol of America’s unmatched exploratory might” and declared that NASA would “continue to lead the way in fueling the pursuit of space discovery and exploration.” The administration’s budgetary actions speak louder than Trump’s words, however. Instead of ushering in a new golden age of space exploration—or even setting up the U.S. to stay atop the podium—the president’s budget “narrows down what the cosmos is to moon and Mars and pretty much nothing else,” Dreier says. “And the cosmos is a lot bigger, and there’s a lot more to learn out there.”', 'Dreier notes that when corrected for inflation, the overall NASA budget would be the lowest it’s been since 1961. But in April of that year, the Soviet Union launched the first human into orbit, igniting a space race that swelled NASA’s budget and led to the Apollo program putting American astronauts on the moon. Today China’s rapid progress and enormous ambitions in space would make the moment ripe for a 21st-century version of this competition, with the U.S. generously funding its own efforts to maintain pole position. Instead the White House’s budget would do the exact opposite.', '“The seesaw is sort of unbalanced,” says Tony Beasley, director of the NSF-funded National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). “On the one side, we’re saying, ‘Well, China’s kicking our ass, and we need to do something about that.’ But then we’re not going to give any money to anything that might actually do that.”', 'How NASA will achieve a crewed return to the moon and send astronauts to Mars—goals that the agency now considers part of “winning the second space race”—while also maintaining its leadership in science is unclear.', '“This is Russ Vought’s budget,” Dreier says, referring to the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an unelected bureaucrat who has been notorious for his efforts to reshape the U.S. government by weaponizing federal funding. “This isn’t even Trump’s budget. Trump’s budget would be good for space. This one undermines the president’s own claims and ambitions when it comes to space.”', 'Rumors began swirling about the demise of NASA science in April, when a leaked OMB document described some of the proposed cuts and cancellations. Those included both the beleaguered, bloated Mars Sample Return (MSR) program and the on-time, on-budget Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the next astrophysics flagship mission.', '', '', 'The top-line numbers in the more fleshed-out proposal are consistent with that document, and MSR would still be canceled. But Roman would be granted a stay of execution: rather than being zeroed out, it would be put on life support.', '“It’s a reprieve from outright termination, but it’s still a cut for functionally no reason,” Dreier says. “In some ways, [the budget] is slightly better than I was expecting. But I had very low expectations.”', 'In the proposal, many of the deepest cuts would be made to NASA science, which would sink from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. Earth science missions focused on carbon monitoring and climate change, as well as programs aimed at education and workforce diversity, would be effectively erased by the cuts. But a slew of high-profile planetary science projects would suffer, too, with cancellations proposed for two future Venus missions, the Juno mission that is currently surveilling Jupiter, the New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto and two Mars orbiters. (The Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan would survive, as would the flagship Europa Clipper spacecraft, which launched last October.) NASA’s international partnerships in planetary science fare poorly, too, as the budget rescinds the agency’s involvement with multiple European-led projects, including a Venus mission and Mars rover.', 'The proposal is even worse for NASA astrophysics—the study of our cosmic home—which “really takes it to the chin,” Dreier says, with a roughly $1-billion drop to just $523 million. In the president’s proposal, only three big astrophysics missions would survive: the soon-to-launch Roman and the already-operational Hubble and JWST. The rest of NASA’s active astrophysics missions, which include the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), would be severely pared back or zeroed out. Additionally, the budget would nix NASA’s contributions to large European missions, such as a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory.', '“This is the most powerful fleet of missions in the history of the study of astrophysics from space,” says John O’Meara, chief scientist at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and co-chair of a recent senior review panel that evaluated NASA’s astrophysics missions. The report found that each reviewed mission “continues to be capable of producing important, impactful science.” This fleet, O’Meara adds, is more than the sum of its parts, with much of its power emerging from synergies among multiple telescopes that study the cosmos in many different types, or wavelengths, of light.', 'By hollowing out NASA’s science to ruthlessly focus on crewed missions, the White House budget might be charitably viewed as seeking to rekindle a heroic age of spaceflight—with China’s burgeoning space program as the new archrival. But even for these supposedly high-priority initiatives, the proposed funding levels appear too anemic and meager to give the U.S. any competitive edge. For example, the budget directs about $1 billion to new technology investments to support crewed Mars missions while conservative estimates have projected that such voyages would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more.', '“It cedes U.S. leadership in space science at a time when other nations, particularly China, are increasing their ambitions,” Dreier says. “It completely flies in the face of the president’s own stated goals for American leadership in space.”', 'The NSF’s situation, which one senior space scientist predicted would be “diabolical” when the NASA numbers leaked back in April, is also unsurprisingly dire. Unlike NASA, which is focused on space science and exploration, the NSF’s programs span the sweep of scientific disciplines, meaning that even small, isolated cuts—let alone the enormous ones that the budget has proposed—can have shockingly large effects on certain research domains.', '“Across the different parts of the NSF, the programs that are upvoted are the president’s strategic initiatives, but then everything else gets hit,” Beasley says.', 'Several large-scale NSF-funded projects would escape more or less intact. Among these are the panoramic Vera C. Rubin Observatory, scheduled to unveil its first science images later this month, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope. The budget also moves the Giant Magellan Telescope, which would boast starlight-gathering mirrors totaling more than 25 meters across, into a final design phase. All three of those facilities take advantage of Chile’s pristine dark skies. Other large NSF-funded projects that would survive include the proposed Next Generation Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico and several facilities at the South Pole, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.', 'If this budget is enacted, however, NSF officials anticipate only funding a measly 7 percent of research proposals overall rather than 25 percent; the number of graduate research fellowships awarded would be cleaved in half, and postdoctoral fellowships in the physical sciences would drop to zero. NRAO’s Green Bank Observatory — home to the largest steerable single-dish radio telescope on the planet — would likely shut down. So would other, smaller observatories in Arizona and Chile. The Thirty Meter Telescope, a humongous, perennially embattled project with no clear site selection, would be canceled. And the budget proposes closing one of the two gravitational-wave detectors used by the LIGO collaboration—whose observations of colliding black holes earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics—even though both detectors need to be online for LIGO’s experiment to work. Even factoring in other operational detectors, such as Virgo in Europe and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Japan, shutting down half of LIGO would leave a gaping blind spot in humanity’s gravitational-wave view of the heavens.', '“The consequences of this budget are that key scientific priorities, on the ground and in space, will take at least a decade longer—or not be realized at all,” O’Meara says. “The universe is telling its story at all wavelengths. It doesn’t care what you build, but if you want to hear that story, you must build many things.”', 'Dreier, Parriott and others are anticipating fierce battles on Capitol Hill. And already both Democratic and Republican legislators have issued statement signaling that they won’t support the budget request as is. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, in a recent statement. And in an earlier statement, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations, cautioned that “the President’s Budget Request is simply one step in the annual budget process.”', 'The Trump administration has “thrown a huge punch here, and there will be a certain back-reaction, and we’ll end up in the middle somewhere,” Beasley says. “The mistake you can make right now is to assume that this represents finalized decisions and the future—because it doesn’t.”', 'NADIA DRAKE is a freelance science journalist who specializes in covering space science and space exploration.

The cuts would reduce NASA’s overall budget from $24.8 billion this year to $18.8 billion next year—a level that, adjusted for inflation, would be the lowest since 1961, before the Apollo program that took humans to the moon.', 'Space advocates are calling these proposed cuts “an extinction level event for science, research and education, outreach and hundreds of local economies that are tied to the agency’s work,” according to Atassi. Major projects like the Orion Spacecraft and the Space Launch System—both of which NASA Glenn has played significant roles in developing—would be canceled entirely.', 'While experts suggest the proposal is likely “dead on arrival” in Congress, the mere suggestion of such dramatic cuts sends a chilling message about the administration’s priorities. Chris Quinn observed on the podcast that these cuts appear to be part of a broader pattern: “When you look at the last four months since Donald Trump has been in office and all of the attacks he’s made in certain areas, it seems like he’s against intelligence and science. He’s savaging Harvard University. He has attacked colleges left and right, and now he is attacking our most significant science industry.”', 'This comes at a time when international competition in science and technology is intensifying. Quinn noted that “the smartest scientists are fleeing the country looking for opportunities elsewhere. And all the other nations on the planet are looking to welcome them and drain our brains.”', 'Northeast Ohio has worked for decades to position itself as a hub for aerospace innovation. NASA Glenn has been instrumental in research on aeronautics, space propulsion, communications technology, and energy systems. The proposed cuts would not only devastate the local economy but potentially set back critical research in areas where America has traditionally led the world.', 'Atassi suggested the motivations behind the cuts reflect both “lack of foresight and a failure to see down the road” as well as a single-minded focus: “All of these cuts are in service to one thing, which are tax cuts for the wealthy. So he’s just trying to find a way to afford that, and he doesn’t care what the casualties are.”', 'Local leaders, including Congressman Max Miller, are pushing back. Miller has expressed strong support for expanding Glenn’s footprint and has even suggested moving NASA headquarters to Ohio.', 'As Congress begins budget deliberations, the future of one of America’s premier scientific institutions—and a critical piece of Northeast Ohio’s economy and identity—hangs in the balance.', 'Listen to the episode here.', 'Note: Artificial intelligence was used to help generate this story from Today in Ohio, a news podcast discussion by cleveland.com editors.
