Sonnen revealed that Jones, widely regarded as one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, has requested a staggering $12 million guaranteed purse for the bout, a figure the UFC appears willing to meet.', 'Sonnen shared this information on his YouTube channel, emphasising that such a payday would eclipse every other UFC payout in history, including that of Brock Lesnar, Georges St-Pierre, and Ronda Rousey.', '“I don’t believe Jon Jones has turned down this fight,” Sonnen said. “Whatever that number was, and I believe it to be $12 million, in case you’re interested. I’ve got my own sources. The UFC said, ‘Okay’. Jon’s check at the end of the night will be the biggest check he’s ever got. It will be the biggest check anyone has ever got from the UFC. It will beat out [Brock] Lesnar, it will beat out Georges [St-Pierre].

Adding to the drama, Tom Aspinall recently claimed that Jones is effectively retired from MMA, a statement that created a wave of speculation across the heavyweight division.', 'Aspinall, the current interim heavyweight champion, has insisted that he is telling the truth about Jones’ retirement. Speaking to The Independent, he said he was not trying to create any media buzz or stunts and confirmed that his next fight will be announced soon.', '“I want to keep my job, so I don’t want to say too much, but I said what I’ve said in other interviews,” Aspinall explained. “People think I’m joking, but it’s the truth. My next fight will be announced pretty soon, as far as I’m aware.”', 'With the heavyweight division currently lacking depth, Aspinall’s next opponent might seem obvious even without official confirmation. Ciryl Gane, who has yet to face Aspinall and sits at number two in the heavyweight rankings, stands out as the most logical contender. Given that many of the other top-ranked fighters have already been decisively beaten by either Aspinall or Gane, a clash between the two would make perfect sense if the unification bout with Jones fails to materialise.', 'Whether Jon Jones will step into the Octagon again for this blockbuster unification fight or not continues to be the biggest question in MMA.

The Briton retained the gold with a first-minute knockout of Curtis Blaydes in July.', 'Despite that dynamic atop the division, the UFC has still not booked a unification bout between the champions, and Jones has never publicly said he will fight Aspinall, who insisted to The Independent this week that “Bones” is retired. Now, Jones himself has offered perhaps the greatest hint yet that he has called time on his career.', 'When one X user told Jones to vacate his title on Friday (6 June), the former two-time light-heavyweight champion replied: “I spoke to the UFC a long time ago about what my future plans were.

The question I asked my close friends and family is how much higher can a person like me [climb] this sport.

I get that it’s uncomfortable and I don’t expect people to understand territories that they’ve never been.”', 'While some view Jones as the greatest mixed martial artist of all time, his career has been marred by numerous failed drug tests and run-ins with the law. Still, Jones is effectively unbeaten, with his sole loss having come via DQ in 2009.', 'Meanwhile, Aspinall is 15-3 in MMA and 8-1 in the UFC. In the promotion, his only defeat occurred due to injury, while all of his career finishes have come via stoppage. In fact, Aspinall holds the UFC record for the shortest fight time of an athlete with five or more bouts; all of his wins in the promotion have come in the first two rounds – seven in round one, two in the first minute.', 'Aspinall’s decision to defend the interim belt was a rarity in the UFC, as the Wigan heavyweight aimed to stay active during Jones’s absence. In that fight, Aspinall stopped Curtis Blaydes in 60 seconds, avenging his injury-induced loss to the American in 2022.', 'This week, Aspinall spoke to The Independent about Jones’s apparent retirement, and broke down the skillsets of the other heavyweights whom he could fight next – most likely Ciryl Gane, Alexander Volkov and Jailton Almeida.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNU1XVVZmZDFST1ZEVkdaa1ZTVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtQkVJeHdGZXZBcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

Spending the first seven years of his career with the Washington Nationals, Harper is now in his seventh season with the Phillies. Originally an outfielder, Harper has made the transition to first base, playing the position primarily for the last few seasons. While his numbers are a bit down this season, Harper still rates as one of the best offensive players in the National League. Entering Friday, the left-handed slugger owns an .814 OPS with nine home runs. As the Phillies begin a series with the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday, Harper was notably absent from the starting lineup. Batting third and playing first base in Philadelphia\'s 9-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday, Harper went 0-for-4. Amid Harper\'s absence from Friday\'s lineup, Phillies manager Rob Thomson announced an update. ""Bryce Harper is out tonight due to a lingering wrist issue that he’s been playing through for awhile, per Rob Thomson,"" Paul Casella of MLB wrote on X. ""Went to the trainers today and said it was bothering him a bit more. Thomson believes it’s a day-to-day situation."" Any right wrist/hand issues will be especially troubling for a left-handed hitter like Harper. Also a right-handed thrower, Harper\'s defense could be impacted by this issue as well. Fortunately it seems as if this ailment is not expected to sideline Harper longterm, as Thomson announced the current timetable is day-to-day.', 'After another early playoff exit, the Toronto Maple Leafs are entering an intriguing offseason. Toronto has a few key players who are entering free agency, and the team could look very different next season because of it. The front office has plenty of decisions to make in the coming weeks, and the shape of the roster is likely to change. Star Mitch Marner is expected to bolt the organization in free agency, and if he does, it would leave a massive hole in offensive production. But the Maple Leafs could look to replace his production by trading for another All-Star talent. Lyle Richardson of Bleacher Report listed the Maple Leafs as a potential trade spot for veteran Jonathan Marchessault of the Nashville Predators. Nashville has been rumored to be looking into moving the veteran, and Toronto could make sense as a landing spot. The biggest concern about a deal between the two sides is the lack of quality draft picks and prospects that could be offered to the Predators in a deal. ""Marchessault\'s contract could be worrisome, but the Leafs are in ""win now"" mode and desperate to end their 58-year Stanley Cup drought. Given his previous playoff success and postseason MVP credentials, they could take that risk if they can get him at a reduced salary."", Richardson wrote. Marchessault saw a down first year with Nashville, and it could lead to him being available for a cheaper-than-normal price. The veteran put up 21 goals and 35 points for the Predators over 78 games played. Toronto could look to replace Marner with Marchessault, while betting that he can get back to form. Marchessault has exceeded 20 goals eight times over his 12-season NHL career, and could be a solid option for the Maple Leafs to at least consider.', 'The Green Bay Packers have expended significant resources building a young cast of reliable pass catchers around quarterback Jordan Love, and several will be called upon to play major roles in 2025. With wide receiver Christian Watson sidelined, the pressure will be on Jayden Reed to make strides on a career-year in which he finished as the Packers’ leading receiver in 2024, Romeo Doubs might open the season as a starter on the perimeter, and first-round pick Matthew Golden will likely play a marquee role immediately. However, tight end Tucker Kraft might be in for the biggest breakout of all. Packers’ Tucker Kraft Labeled NFL Breakout Star to Watch Kraft is coming off a stellar 2024 season, where he emerged as one of Love’s favorite and most reliable targets. After catching 50 passes for 707 yards and seven touchdowns in his second NFL season, one top NFL analyst suggests Kraft’s 2025 campaign could be even more prolific. CBS Sports NFL analyst Garrett Podell lists Kraft as one of the NFL’s top breakout stars to watch in the season ahead. “Green Bay Packers tight end Tucker Kraft,” Podell writes for CBS. “A 2023 third-round pick out of South Dakota State, took a leap in his second in 2024, but he could take an even bigger jump to becoming a Pro Bowl tight end in 2025. Kraft was the fourth-most targeted Packer last season, but he ended up second on the team in both catches (50) and receiving yards (707) while leading Green Bay in touchdown catches (seven). “With more targets and a healthier season from quarterback Jordan Love, Kraft could become a household name in the NFL in 2025.” In addition to his ability to be a playmaker after the catch, the fact that Love posted a stellar 134.6 passer rating when throwing Kraft’s direction suggests that the 24-year-old could become one of the premier tight ends in the league this fall.', 'The A\'s, formerly of Oakland, currently transitioning to Las Vegas via a three-year plan playing at Triple-A Sutter Health Park, clearly have some disgruntled fans. One of them became the object of some controversy Thursday night. During the NBC Sports California pregame show, a man caught the eye of security at the stadium due to the message on his t-shirt. The shirt, in the Athletics team color, was rather mundane. The offending message to ownership? ""Sell."" The fan stood behind the broadcast and, as the video below shows, was immediately greeted by a member of the team\'s security. Shortly thereafter, the broadcast cut to commercial, and upon returning, several security personnel were blocking the fan from camera view. And more keep funnelling down to join the fray. How thin-skinned is management that a t-shirt like this is a bridge too far? The fan, who later identified himself as Joe Horton, responded to social media posts about the incident. ""Not my first rodeo; happy to be there,"" he wrote on X. ""When they show up, I think the whole time – you know this too is on TV right?"" Judging by how swiftly security swooped in to intercept and block him, he\'s right. It\'s not his first rodeo. It probably won\'t be his last either. Fortunately, Horton revealed that security allowed him to stay for the game after a nice, lengthy conversation in close quarters. He got to see a rare win for the ""home"" team over the Minnesota Twins. The Athletics brass might want to worry more about the product they\'re putting on a Triple-A field than a harmless fan who disapproves of their work. The A\'s were riding high on May 13, having improved to two games over .500 by demolishing the defending World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. Since then, they\'ve been bad.

And you know what I think a big worry might be for him? With Aspinall, he could potentially get knocked out. Like, legitimately knocked out and put on his back out cold. I just don’t know that he wants to have that visual of him in the world. He’s knocked out a lot of guys and he’s never had — because I’ve seen myself get beat, and I’m like, ‘God, that’s such a horrible visual every time.’”', 'As Aspinall himself notes, he has the shortest average fight time of any fighter currently on the roster.

Especially when there’s a real possibility that he just outclasses Tom Aspinall.', '“There’s a real possibility that he goes out there and he outclasses Tom Aspinall. You don’t know. So I think that he will fight him. I don’t think they’ll need to strip him, I think he’ll fight him.

Lately, Jones has leaned all the way in on trolling Aspinall over the delays in booking, and now Aspinall is striking back.', 'On Monday, Aspinall told Daniel Cormier and Chael Sonnen on their Good Guy/Bad Guy show that he’s done waiting around for Jones, who he says is retired from the game.', '“Jon’s retired,” Aspinall said. “What are you talking about? You guys don’t follow Jon on social media? The guy is living his best life. He’s had a fantastic career, we all know. We know Jon’s a religious man, so I want to say God bless him moving forward, what he does in his life and his career, and we move on. We move on. I’m the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. I’m ready to take on all comers, get this division moving again. Us guys have been waiting around too long. The guys, contenders are getting sick of it, everybody’s getting sick of it, even the fans are getting sick of it. Jon’s retired and it’s time that we move on.”', 'While Jones hasn’t officially retired, he also doesn’t appear to be close to fighting anytime soon. The former UFC light heavyweight champion has been open that he’s not sure if he wants to fight again and insists he’s just out there living his best life. And for Aspinall, that pretty much confirms it.', '“If one guy is thinking about retiring, he’s retired,” Aspinall said. “I ain’t thinking about retiring. I’m thinking about getting this division active, making the heavyweight division great again, getting these big fights in, fighting these contenders who are sat on the sidelines waiting for over a year at this point. I’m here to fight, man.”', 'Aspinall is currently the longest-reigning interim champion in UFC history, at just short of 600 days. And while some people might be upset about waiting that long for a shot at an all-time great like Jones, Aspinall doesn’t mind. He’s just ready to get on with things, and he says that will happen soon.', '“I’m not looking to fight Jon Jones,” Aspinall said. “I’m looking to fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. That’s what I want to be. I want to be the UFC undisputed heavyweight champion. I see a lot of people comparing me to Michael Chandler. Michael Chandler waited for a long time for Conor McGregor.

I want to fight everybody, and I want to fight as much as possible, get some excitement back in this division. Let’s not talk about Jon Jones anymore. All the best, the guy’s living his best life.

UFC Allegedly Has an Ulterior Motive for Not Stripping Jon Jones of His Title Yet,https://www.profootballnetwork.com/ufc/ufc-ulterior-motive-not-stripping-jon-jones-of-title/,"['For months now, the UFC’s heavyweight division has been stuck. Jon Jones isn’t budging for a title unification bout with Tom Aspinall, the interim champion. Yet despite no fight announcement and an uncertain timeline for Jones’ return, UFC CEO Dana White maintains that the unification bout is still the plan.', 'However, Brazilian Renato Moicano doesn’t see it that way. In his view, the UFC may be playing a different game altogether, one that has less to do with title integrity and more to do with boardroom leverage.', 'As the UFC prepares to enter a critical phase in broadcast rights negotiations, Moicano has a theory that aligns Jones’ continued status as champion with the business side of the promotion.', 'In a recent interview with MMA Fighting, Moicano criticized the delay Aspinall is facing and drew comparisons to Conor McGregor’s long absence ahead of a yet-to-happen fight against Michael Chandler.', '“I think it’s absurd,” Moicano said, reacting to the interim champion’s prolonged inactivity. “[Jones] is doing the same thing [Conor] McGregor did to [Michael] Chandler — two years waiting, wanting to pass Tom Aspinall’s prime.”', '.@moicanoufc says new UFC TV deal is impacting Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall:', '""I think they’re on this leverage with Jon Jones and McGregor because of the [TV deal]. … Who are the ones that sell?

But he sees the broader picture. And part of that involves the UFC’s strategic positioning as it enters open bidding for its next media rights deal. Whether intentional or not, Moicano’s comments point to a reality in the fight business: timing isn’t just about athlete availability.', 'Jones’ global name recognition, long-standing draw power, and stature as one of the greatest of all time arguably carry significant commercial value. With TKO Group Holdings CEO Ari Emanuel and Dana White now navigating high-stakes negotiations, every marquee asset counts. Stripping Jones of the title could devalue the division in the eyes of bidders, particularly if a replacement bout lacks the same cachet.', '', 'For now, fans are still hoping the UFC inks a deal so that they can witness the two heavyweights lock horns inside the Octagon. Naturally, there are more elements to consider. Jones isn’t getting any younger. By many standards, he is already past his prime. So, while the promotion might leverage him in negotiations, there could be an expiring date attached to that leverage.', 'Who do you think will become the undisputed UFC heavyweight champion?

Jones finally returned 12 months later and stopped Miocic, but only after Aspinall made the rare move of defending the interim title, which he retained with a knockout of Curtis Blaydes last July.', 'As a result of the Briton’s victory and Jones’s success against fellow American Miocic, the pair should have been paired in a title unification bout by now. However, 38-year-old Jones has refused to commit to such a contest, never publicly saying he will fight Aspinall, 32.', 'That led the Wigan heavyweight to tell Chael Sonnen and Daniel Cormier, two of Jones’s former opponents, this week: “Jon’s retired [...] The guy’s living his best life, he’s had a fantastic career, we all know. We know Jon’s a religious man, so I want to say: God bless him moving forward with what he does in his life and career.', '“We move on.

The contenders are getting sick of it, everybody’s getting sick of it, even the fans are getting sick of this stuff. So, Jon’s retired, and it’s time that we move on.”', 'And speaking to The Independent on Wednesday (4 June), at the launch of Aspinall’s long-term partnership with sportswear brand Champion, he added: “I want to keep my job, so I don’t want to say too much, but I said what I’ve said in other interviews and stuff... People think I’m joking, but it’s the truth.', '“I’m not the kind of guy to pull any media stunts or anything like that, like... What I’m saying is the truth.”', 'Aspinall added that his next fight “will be announced pretty soon as far as I’m aware”, after he told Sonnen and Cormier: “I’ve got a date and a location.

So, for me to have the opportunity to fight again after a year of being healthy and not fighting, that just makes me happy. So, I feel good about it.”', 'Fans may interpret those updates as Aspinall having agreed a return date with the UFC but without Jones being confirmed as his opponent. With the UFC having announced main events for its pay-per-views in June, July and August, Aspinall seems unlikely to fight before September, which was set to host a Mexican-centric PPV that is now a standard Fight Night.', 'While some fans view Jones, a former two-time light-heavyweight champion, as the greatest mixed martial artist of all time, his career has been marred by numerous failed drug tests and run-ins with the law. Still, Jones is effectively unbeaten, with his sole loss having come via DQ in 2009.', 'Meanwhile, Aspinall is 15-3 in MMA and 8-1 in the UFC. In the promotion, his only defeat occurred due to injury, while all of his career finishes have come via stoppage. In fact, Aspinall holds the UFC record for the shortest fight time of an athlete with five or more bouts; all of his wins in the promotion have come in the first two rounds – seven in round one, two in the first minute.', 'Aspinall’s decision to defend the interim belt was a rarity in the UFC, as the Wigan heavyweight aimed to stay active during Jones’s absence. In that fight, Aspinall stopped Curtis Blaydes in 60 seconds, avenging his injury-induced loss to the American in 2022.', 'Tom Aspinall’s new apparel line HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION is available now at championstore.com.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNU1XVVZmZDFST1ZEVkdaa1ZTVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtQkVJeHdGZXZBcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

"Renato Moicano discusses how new UFC TV deal impacts Tom Aspinall’s future, Jon Jones’ leverage",https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/6/4/24437881/renato-moicano-new-ufc-tv-deal-tom-aspinall-jon-jones-conor-mcgregor,"['FILED UNDER:', 'The Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall saga gains new layers every day on social media with both UFC heavyweight champions — lineal and interim — taking shots at each other. Meanwhile, UFC CEO Dana White constantly repeats, whenever asked, that the unification bout will happen.', 'UFC veteran Renato Moicano doesn’t share the optimism.', '“I think it’s absurd,” Moicano told MMA Fighting about Aspinall being forced to sit out a record time without a chance to unify belts. “[Jones] is doing the same thing [Conor] McGregor did to [Michael] Chandler, two years waiting, wanting to pass Tom Aspinall’s prime. The difference is that one is a champion — but McGregor was more than a champion because McGregor has the McGregor hype.”', 'Moicano does believe White truly wants to book the fight. But even though the company could quickly move on from it if Jones decides to retire instead of facing a young challenger in Aspinall, having him around while negotiating an important TV deal means good business.', '“The UFC is in a difficult situation because at the same time they want to resolve this, they still need Jon Jones — at least his image, just like they need McGregor,” Moicano said. “That’s two problems the UFC would rather not have, but if they tell these guys to f*ck off, or if they pull them off, the company loses a lot. There’s no space for stars like in the past. Like McGregor, like Jon Jones, like Ronda Rousey and Brock Lesnar. It’s more spread now. I think the only star that had that kind of appeal was Alex Pereira, who had that and lost. Had he beat [Magomed] Ankalaev, he would be on that level of popularity.', '“But Pereira lost, and Ankalaev is [champion]. Tell me, which champion is popular? You have [Alexandre] Pantoja, who isn’t popular. [Merab] Dvalishvili is getting more popular but isn’t popular either. [Alexander] Volkanovski is popular, but lost twice to Islam [Makhachev] and he’s older — and was never a global star like Max Holloway was. At 155 you have Islam, who’s very popular in the Arab world but doesn’t impresses the American and Western audience. Dustin Poirier would have been better deal for the UFC. At 170 you had Belal Muhammad and now it’s Jack Della Maddalena, who has like 300,000 followers, he just started. At 185, it’s Dricus Du Plessis, who isn’t popular. [Khamzat] Chimaev would have been much better. At 205, it’s Magomed Ankalaev. Not even his mother cares about him [laughs].', '“And heavyweight it’s Jon Jones. The UFC is in [Jones and McGregor’s] hands, but in my opinion they should strip him of the belt and put Tom Aspinall to fight someone else. But if you look at the division, who else? Ciryl Gane? I think Ciryl Gane sucks. People will criticize me, but Ciryl Gane can’t even spell jiu-jitsu, brother. [Alexander] Volkov is doing anything but fight. People won’t fight. So the UFC is in Jon Jones’ hands. And I don’t think the [Aspinall] fight won’t happen. Jon Jones is just buying time and won’t do it because there’s a big chance he loses to Tom Aspinall. Aspinall is a new generation of heavyweights. He’s fast, athletic, and the risk isn’t worth it.”', 'In the end, Moicano feels that the idea of having Jones face Aspinall hurts the promotion because the UFC, under today’s business model and ESPN deal, isn’t incentivized to open the checkbook for bigger fights.', '“Not only it creates demand [from fans], it gives [Jones] leverage in negotiation,” Moicano said. “McGregor has an absurd leverage with the UFC. And people don’t understand that the UFC has made McGregor. You can’t take anyone and try to repeat the recipe, you need a very specific personality to make someone a McGregor. But at the same time, without the UFC machine that can make anyone a star, McGregor wouldn’t have become the monster he is today. The UFC has to be very careful. He has to watch the wolf so it doesn’t grow to big, you know? The wolf has to stay small to scare the others, but don’t bite the owner.”', 'With growing site fees for on the road events, and an even bigger TV deal on the horizon, the finances of the UFC look better than even on the long term.', '“[The UFC] is making money in every shape and form now, especially with this switch, ESPN leaving and Netflix or Amazon coming,” Moicano said. “There’s more billions now. They’re saying like a billion per year. And like, it doesn’t matter who’s fighting. Signing guys for 8+8 or 10+10 on the Contender [Series] and putting them to fight. Like Raul Rosas Jr. fighting someone ranked. Like [Caio] Borralho, who left the Contender on a small contract and was already fighting tough guys. You win? Promote this guy. You lose? Call someone else. Their machine is pretty much unbeatable, so they aren’t too worried about any of that.', '“I think they’re on this leverage with Jon Jones and McGregor because of the [TV deal]. They need numbers to show Netflix. Who are the ones that sell? It’s obviously McGregor first, then Jon Jones, and maybe Alex Pereira [third]. But they need to have these numbers to be able to negotiate how much [the network] will pay. After the deal is done, f*ck it, brother, it’s five more years with money on the pocket, and we think about all that later.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNU1XVVZmZDFST1ZEVkdaa1ZTVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtQkVJeHdGZXZBcFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

Why is he still holding on to the belt if he has no intention of defending? He says that’s the UFC’s choice, and once again blamed them for letting him make a mockery of the division.', '“I spoke to the UFC a long time ago about what my future plans were,” Jones tweeted. “I haven’t really worked out since my last fight in New York City.

Jones finally returned 12 months later and stopped Miocic, but only after Aspinall made the rare move of defending the interim title, which he retained with a knockout of Curtis Blaydes last July.', 'As a result of the Briton’s victory and Jones’s success against fellow American Miocic, the pair should have been paired in a title unification bout by now. However, 38-year-old Jones has refused to commit to such a contest, never publicly saying he will fight Aspinall, 32.', 'This week, the Wigan heavyweight told Chael Sonnen and Daniel Cormier, two of Jones’s former opponents, that “Bones” has retired. He then told The Independent: “I want to keep my job, so I don’t want to say too much, but I said what I’ve said in other interviews and stuff... People think I’m joking, but it’s the truth. I’m not the kind of guy to pull any media stunts or anything like that, like... What I’m saying is the truth.”', 'Aspinall added that his next fight “will be announced pretty soon as far as I’m aware”, after he told Sonnen and Cormier: “I’ve got a date and a location.”', 'Fans may interpret those updates as Aspinall having agreed a return date with the UFC but without Jones being confirmed as his opponent. With the UFC having announced main events for its pay-per-views in June, July and August, Aspinall seems unlikely to fight before September, which was set to host a Mexican-centric PPV that is now a standard Fight Night.', 'And if Jones is not his opponent, the likeliest options are Ciryl Gane, Alexander Volkov and Jailton Almeida – ranked second, third and sixth respectively. Aspinall has already beaten No 4 Pavlovich and No 5 Blaydes, and although he also holds a submission win over Volkov, the Russian bounced back with four straight wins before a controversial split-decision loss to Gane.', ""“Volkov is the tallest guy in the UFC, 6f 9in,” Aspinall told The Independent. “He’s got like 45-50 pro fights, bags of experience, and he's just a good, solid all-rounder. He’s good everywhere, really awkward, massive. He’s seen everything except a UFC title. I think all that combined just makes him really dangerous."", '“Gane’s a great mover, controls the range very well. He’s a great kicker for a big guy. He’s a former interim champion himself, he’s fought everybody apart for me at the top level basically. He’s very good.', ""“Almeida is a good grappler, striking we haven’t seen too much of yet, but people say the same about my grappling. People say, ‘Well, he’s not that good of a grappler,’ but I just haven’t had the chance to show it. Maybe he’s the same with his striking. Most of his fights are predominantly grappling-heavy, but it doesn’t mean he can't strike; he’s just not had the opportunity to show it yet.”"", 'Aspinall also opened up on how he has stayed motivated over the past 11 months, without having a fight signed, saying: “I’m in a really lucky position. We’ve set up a really good training situation, where heavyweights and light-heavyweights come to us to do their camps. I’m so lucky that my dad has created that kind of environment.', '“Guys are coming from overseas to do training camps, coming in sharp for hard sparring and hard rounds. If I ain’t there, I’m gonna get my ass kicked basically, and I don’t want that! I want to be as sharp as possible. So, I just want to say how much I appreciate my training situation and the guys I’ve got there, because without them, it would have been a really depressing time.', '“I’m not the kind of person who gives myself a lot of credit; I beat myself up a lot. But I feel like I’ve really been consistent in improving my skills in the time I’ve not been fighting. That is one of the blessings of not having a fight booked: you can just work on your overall game. [Jiu-jitsu champion] Craig Jones was here last week; a couple of weeks ago, I was in Holland sparring Rico Verhoeven, the best kickboxer of all time. So, I’ve really taken this time to improve as a mixed martial artist. Thank God, soon I will get the opportunity to show everybody.”', 'Aspinall was speaking at the launch of his long-term partnership with sportswear brand Champion. On the new deal, he said: “I was looking to move forward with someone who I can go to the end of my fighting career and beyond with. I’m in a really good position, where it can be a brand that I like; I don’t just have to take a brand for money or exposure.
