That evening, after drinking champagne and tequila, Doe said she confronted Diddy about who had accompanied him on a family trip to Utah days earlier.', 'As he bent over to tie his shoe, she pushed his head on the marble kitchen counter. Pressed on how hard she pushed, she said: “I gave it a good shot.” She then started throwing glass and candles at him, with some wax landing on his clothing as she yelled that she “hated” him, she told the court.', 'Diddy, in turn, called her “f***ing crazy” as she ran to the master bedroom and locked the door before things escalated further, Doe testified.', 'She claimed that Diddy kicked it down and when she went to the master bathroom, the same thing happened, but this time he kicked the door “literally off the hinges,” she recalled. She fled then to her walk-in closet, locked the door, and told him to “just go” as she changed out of her tight dress and into something looser, but the door was once again no match for the music mogul, who kicked it down too, she testified.', 'Federal prosecutors have charged the music mogul with five federal counts of racketeering conspiracy, transportation to engage in prostitution, and sex trafficking.

Without a phone or anything else, she hid for what felt like two hours, she recalled.', 'When she returned to her house, Diddy was still there and she told the cout, “I was scared but I was quiet.” She said that when she entered the guest bedroom, Diddy kicked down that door as well. She then threw more glass and candles at him before running to the patio, where more violence ensued.', 'She punched him in the forehead, near his temple, and he punched her twice in the forehead near her eyes, Doe recalled.

He grabbed her by her arm and her hair and dragged her back to the house as he called her “crazy,” Doe testified.', 'When inside, she managed to grab his phone and call a woman she accused him of being with in Utah.', '“Sean was holding me down and making me listen to her insults” on speakerphone, she said. After the call, Doe went to take a shower “to cool off” and caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror — including two golf-ball sized welts on her forehead and a black eye forming.', 'In the shower, Diddy slapped her three times, causing her to lose balance and fall, she testified. At the same time, she recalled, Doe was calling him a “bitch” and said she “hated him.” Once she got out of the shower, Diddy told her, “Just put some ice on it and put an outfit on.” She understood that to mean lingerie and heels, Doe testified.', 'The music mogul then used her phone to watch pornography and to text Anton, an escort they saw occasionally. Doe asked why Diddy texted Anton, to which he allegedly said: “You’re not going to ruin my night like this.” So she covered her face with makeup and fixed her hair to cover her welts.', 'Diddy later demanded she take an ecstasy pill. Doe said she didn’t want to take it. Diddy then, an inch from her face, replied: “Is this coercion?” His tone was “forceful,” Doe told the court as she wiped tears from her cheeks. He told her to perform oral sex on Anton. “It felt like forever,” she recalled. “I just felt sick. Even in my own body, I just felt disgusted. I felt terrible.”', 'Her cross-examination begins Tuesday.', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDNYM1JzU201VE1tUkllVXhHVFJEVkFSakFBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Cassie has testified Combs assaulted her numerous times and made her endure “hundreds” of encounters with male sex workers called “ freak-offs ” that he allegedly watched and filmed.', 'Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges of running his business empire as a racketeering enterprise that enabled and concealed the abuse of women over two decades. He faces 15 years to life if convicted.', 'Jane testified she told Combs repeatedly, in person and in writing, that she did not want to keep having those freak-offs with other men. But Combs kept pushing her into them and she felt “obligated” to go along with it, she said. He also had control over her life in other ways, she said, including by paying the rent on her home.', 'Jane spoke barely above a whisper to an attentive jury throughout her afternoon testimony. Jurors leaned forward as she testified, and several jurors sometimes looked toward Combs as she spoke. Combs mostly looked straight at Jane, however it did not seem that she ever reciprocated.', 'A single mother, Jane said she got to know Combs while on a “girls’ trip” to Miami in 2020 with a friend who was dating him at the time. Jane said she dated him from 2021 to 2024 in what began as a loving and passionate relationship.', 'While testifying, she dropped her head and appeared to get emotional, wiping away tears, as a prosecutor asked her about a turning point in their relationship: May 2021, when she said Combs started talking to her about his sexual fantasies involving other men and role playing.', 'One night, she acquiesced because it “seemed like he wanted that, and it was turning him on,” and she wanted to make him happy. Within hours, she said, she was in a Miami hotel room watching Combs’ personal assistants setting the space up for a freak-off.', 'Jane’s description of her “hotel nights” with Combs and male sex workers closely paralleled Cassie’s testimony earlier in the trial. At times, the women said they’d try to speed things up so the encounters would be over sooner.', 'Jane said she was dating Combs at the time of his arrest last September.', 'The judge has taken steps to protect Jane’s anonymity, including warning observers not to describe or sketch her in a way that would reveal her identity. The Associated Press does not identify people who say they’re victims of sexual abuse unless they choose to make their names public, as Cassie has done.', 'Before Jane testified, while jurors were at lunch, Judge Arun Subramanian said he spotted Combs staring at the jury and energetically nodding toward them twice while one of his lawyers carried out an aggressive cross-examination of a prior witness.', 'The judge said he would ban Combs from the courtroom if he continued trying to interact with jurors, adding sternly: “There should be no efforts whatsoever to have an interaction with this jury.”', 'Combs seemed relaxed and smiled widely afterward, perhaps a reaction to the success his lawyer had experienced with the cross-examination. He has been active in his defense throughout the trial, regularly writing notes to his lawyers, and they have consulted with him as they questioned witnesses.', 'The judge said Combs was nodding as his defense team cross-examined Bryana “Bana” Bongolan, a graphic designer who has a pending lawsuit against Combs.', 'She testified the previous day that Combs once dangled her over a balcony of a high-rise Los Angeles apartment for 10 to 15 seconds. She says the 2016 episode traumatized her and left her with lasting nightmares. For a time afterward, she said she would wake up screaming.', 'Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland pressed Bongolan on inconsistencies Thursday, suggesting she lied or exaggerated some of her claims.', 'The lawyer said Combs might not have even been in Los Angeles when Bongolan alleges he dangled her from the balcony. Combs was performing on tour for most of September 2016, including dates on the East Coast around the time cellphone metadata shows she took pictures of her alleged injuries.', '“You agree that one person can’t be in two places at the same time,” Westmoreland asked.', 'Bongolan responded: “In like theory, yeah. It’s hard to answer that one.”', 'Questioned again by prosecutors, Bongolan said that while she doesn’t recall the exact date, she has no doubt that the balcony episode happened.', 'RECOMMENDED', '‘I’m the devil and I could kill you’: Woman testifies Diddy dangled her from 17th floor balconyJun. 4, 2025, 4:17 p.m.', 'Diddy’s ex-girlfriend testifies she cried, threw up during ‘dark, sleazy’ sex marathonsJun. 6, 2025, 10:56 a.m.', 'Bongolan also acknowledged she smoked marijuana with Combs not long after the balcony episode, then went to one of his concerts a week later and a private party he held around the same time.', '“You weren’t too fearful enough to not go to Mr. Combs’ event, were you?” Westmoreland asked.', '“I always had a feeling inside, but yes, I went,” Bongolan said.', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

But shortly after arriving, Combs seemed bored and invited a male escort and personal trainer to join them.', '“We had another one of these long nights,” Jane told the jury. who did not know an escort would be joining them. At one point, she said, she had sex for more than 24 hours. “It was just really painful,” said Jane. “I was extremely sore at this point.”', 'Jane said she tried to distance herself from Sean Combs for a period in early 2023.

Jane — a pseudonym for the witness to protect her privacy — said she began a relationship with Combs on a trip to Miami and later Turks and Caicos in early 2021. She said that, as time went on, 90 percent of their sex involved other men as Combs made Jane perform in freak-offs but that she still considered him her lover.', 'Jurors are looking at a text chain from November 2021, after Jane returned from a two-day freak-off that she had thought was going to be a weekend getaway with Sean Combs, and saw he posted Instagram photos of another woman at his home gym', '“This doesn’t make me feel good at all,” Jane wrote. “I see what I’m turning into in your eyes. ...You’ve been saying you miss me and want to see me but you were lying, you just want the hotel s---.”', 'Combs responded with an expletive-filled voice message that thundered through the courtroom on replay: “You are f---ing nuts. So be sad, go crazy, go do whatever the f--- you want to do,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if i just finished f---ing her the other day.”', 'Jane developed urinary tract or yeast infections after nearly every freak-off, she testified. Her back and shoulders often hurt afterward “because I would be at the edge of a seat or the edge of a bed in the position that he [Sean Combs] liked.”', 'Combs would sometimes make Jane have sex with escorts in another freak-off before her previous UTIs had healed, she said. “It felt like burning and constant urination.” Her pelvic area also hurt during freak-offs, she testified, but she didn’t feel comfortable complaining because Combs wanted her to “stay positive.” Jane said he would become “upset, defensive, belittling, dismissive” on multiple occasions when she suggested pausing the sessions.', 'Sean Combs sometimes ran out of cash — as well as drugs — during his marathon freak-offs, according to his former girlfriend and alleged sex trafficking victim, testifying under the alias Jane. Combs would typically pay escorts, and if the events ran long, Jane said, he would have one of his employees bring more cash to the room, much like staff routinely supplied pill bottles full of illegal drugs.', 'Prosecutors are hoping to underscore the amount of cash and illegal activity that flowed through a single night in one of Combs’ freak-offs. The defense has painted the events as consensual parties.', 'After Jane told Sean Combs she didn’t want any more freak-offs, she testified, he promised her a night alone if she flew to New York City. While she waited for him in an SUV outside the Trump International Hotel, she told the jury, she noted one of the hotel rooms was lit up in red. “I was like, wow, that’s extremely obvious,” Jane recalled. “The red-light room.”', 'We’ve heard testimony throughout the trial that Combs meticulously prepared hotel rooms for freak-offs with supplies and decorations, including mood lights.

She recalled paying at least two men with cash from what she referred to as Combs’s “cash drawer” in the hotel rooms they used for freak-offs.', 'One of the lower-level charges against Combs involves transporting men or women across state lines “with intent that such individual engage in prostitution,” language stemming from 1910 legislation known as the Mann Act. Prosecutors have presented compelling evidence to meet the legal criteria for that charge.', 'Combs’s legal team has attacked this strategy as racially motivated, noting that the Mann Act was used to convict Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, for fraternizing with White women. President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Johnson in 2018.', 'A network of prostitutes was available for freak-offs, Jane testified, but she and Sean Combs eventually started recruiting porn stars to join the sessions. Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym, said she reached out to at least two adult film stars, including one named “Chef” because he worked as a private cook on the side. She said she began suggesting Combs hire porn stars rather than prostitutes, so she could have sex with men she was familiar with rather than strangers.', 'When assistant U.S. attorney Maurene Comey asked Jane why she acted “cute and bubbly” with a particular porn star, the witness replied: “Because he was familiar with me. Because he felt like a safe option.”', 'Sean Combs’s sons Christian and Justin were seen arriving at the courthouse together Friday.', 'Sean Combs twice asked Jane to bring a package of drugs from California to Miami in her checked luggage, the pseudonymous witness testified. Jane said she was uncomfortable with the idea, but a member of Combs’s staff told her she often carried his drugs.', 'The breadth of this testimony is growing, and prosecutors are guiding it to show that, for Jane, what began as an idealistic relationship with Combs devolved into forced sex acts and transporting controlled substances across state lines. The government’s racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges revolve around victims being forced into actions they otherwise would not have been comfortable doing.', 'Sean Combs would regularly run out of drugs during freak-offs and have his security guards or assistants fetch more, his former girlfriend testified under her alias, Jane. She said staff would show up at the hotel rooms with pill bottles full of ecstasy, cocaine and a mixture of cannabis and tobacco.', 'Jane said she and Combs usually took stimulants, but a dealer named Guido would sometimes bring Xanax. “You need something really heavy to knock you out,” Jane said. “I would take it after I put Sean to sleep.”', 'Sean Combs’s lawyers are crowding around him at the defense table while the court is on a short break.

She said she eventually asked Combs for ecstasy.', 'By 2023, Jane testified, she was concerned for Sean Combs’s health and got him to promise to take a month off from drugs. He agreed, if they could have one last “sobriety party,” she said.', 'The couple booked a hotel room at the L’Ermitage in Beverly Hills, where Jane struggled without drugs to perform sex acts for 12 to 18 hours. After sex with two male escorts she began throwing up, she said. “Sean came in and I told him I had just thrown up and he was like, ‘that’s good then you’ll feel better. … Let’s go because the guy is here, the third guy.’”', 'Jane, a former girlfriend of Sean Combs, is reading a text message from 2023 in which she pleaded with him to stop having freak-offs.

It’s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” she continued. “I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.”', '“Girl stop,” Combs replied.', 'Eventually, Sean Combs only wanted to have sex with Jane after she had spent hours with a male prostitute, his former girlfriend testified under her court-approved pseudonym. Jane explained that due to her love for and infatuation with Combs, she longed for one-on-one time with him, which she only got after having sex with other men while he watched. “I started to feel obligated, that I had to perform,” Jane said.', 'Her testimony is strikingly similar to that of Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs years before Jane. In the trial’s first week, Ventura also broke down on the stand as she said freak-offs were the “only time I could get” with Combs.', 'Sean Combs’s mother, Janice Combs, was seen entering the courthouse Friday in a floral outfit.', 'Jane recalled crying at least twice during freak-offs with Sean Combs and male escorts, once during a group sex session at the Waldorf in Beverly Hills when Combs seemed offended. “He said, ‘Are you crying?’ and just looked, like, disgusted with my face,” Jane testified.', ""The second time was in Miami, when Jane said she was so high she was intermittently blacking out. Jane clung to Combs’s butler in desperation before Combs made her have sex with an escort, she testified. Later, she said, she broke down in tears in the shower with Combs. “He just said, ‘don’t f---ing do this right now. I’m high and I can’t f---ing see that. I’m too high,'' Jane told the jury."", 'Jane shuddered, averted her eyes and broke down in tears as video of her performing sex acts in a freak-off played in the courtroom. She paused her testimony, took a breath and collected herself, as she has done three times in the past 10 minutes as the footage plays.', 'Combs leaned in alongside his attorneys to watch the video, which he recorded. Due to concerns around anonymity, videos of Jane in freak-offs are being shown to jurors and lawyers, but only the audio is made available for the rest of the court and journalists.', 'A video recording from a freak-off or “hotel night” is playing, in which Jane asked a male escort to use a condom. (We in the press room can only hear the audio, to protect the privacy of the witness, who is testifying under a pseudonym.) The escort agrees, before Combs can be heard walking into the room. Jane’s voice cracks, saying “you promised.” Then Combs apparently refuses the request, telling her: “You are just taking that. …”', 'The prosecution is trying to demonstrate that the freak-offs were not always, or not totally, consensual for partners of Combs such as Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym. “I just understood that my request was going to be denied,” she told the jury.', '“He wanted me to be wild and sexual,” Jane testified, describing Sean Combs’s instructions to her during their freak-offs, or “hotel nights” with male prostitutes.', 'The prosecution witness testifying under a pseudonym said she asked the male prostitutes to use condoms on multiple occasions, but she said she eventually stopped trying because Combs preferred her to have unprotected sex..""He did not want to see a rubber while watching,” she testified.', 'On Thursday, Jane told jurors that freak-offs would typically last 24 to 30 hours, during which Combs would watch her and the escorts perform sex acts while he masturbated.', 'Jane is back on the stand. Testifying under a pseudonym, she spoke yesterday of how her passionate and exciting, sometimes “taboo ” relationship with Sean Combs devolved into forced sex acts under financial duress.', 'She is wearing a maroon suit, and like yesterday, seems shaky but resolved. As she took a seat on the witness stand, she looked down at her hands, taking a deep breath before giving a terse, slight smile to the courtroom.', 'The parties are discussing how much evidence can be allowed as part of Jane’s testimony, including six years of text messages between two of Sean Combs’s personal assistants that the government hopes to admit. Prosecutors have culled some of the messages at the request of the defense, but Combs’s team is arguing there are still too many.', 'The judge will allow the texts, insofar as they are relevant. The glimpse we saw included communications about cleaning hotel rooms.', 'Sean Combs entered the courtroom wearing a dark sweater over a white collared shirt. Like most days, he spoke with his lawyers, hugging some of them, looked into the gallery and maintained a relaxed and collegial demeanor.

Diddy’s Ex ‘Jane’ Describes Hellish ‘Hotel Nights’,https://www.thecut.com/article/jane-testimony-diddy-trial-bryana-bongolan-week-5.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'The fifth week of the sex-trafficking case against Sean “Diddy” Combs introduced testimony from a third anonymous victim: “Jane,” a single mother who dated Combs between 2020 and 2024. Jane alleged that Combs used financial control over her life to secure her continued participation in the Freak Offs at the center of the trial.', 'Prosecutors allege that Combs coerced women — including his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura — into prolonged sexual encounters with male escorts, which often lasted for days thanks to the drugs he allegedly used to keep participants compliant and awake. The government claims that Combs engaged in physical, financial, and psychological abuse to make sure the women obeyed, and that he would film Freak Offs to blackmail them into silence. (Combs denies these allegations and has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking and racketeering charges against him.) So far, Jane’s testimony appears to support their argument. Jane told the court that, after she agreed to one third-party sexual scenario with Combs, she felt she had opened “a Pandora’s box” that she was “unable to shut for the remainder of [the] relationship.”', 'Additionally, jurors heard from several other witnesses for the prosecution whose testimony is intended to show that Combs’s alleged transgressions stretched beyond his sexual partners. A Beverly Hills Hotel employee recalled Combs booking rooms under the name of an assistant, Phillip Pines, and accruing hefty cleaning fees for “oil damage” and drapes that were “soiled beyond what is normal.” A forensic video investigator testified that security footage from the InterContinental Century City Hotel in Los Angeles — which shows Combs beating Ventura in 2016 — had not been tampered with or edited, as the defense has repeatedly claimed. Bad Boy’s former CFO went over financial records confirming a $20,000 transfer from Ventura’s parents to Combs, which previous witnesses said was made to keep the rapper from releasing sex tapes of their daughter. And at one point, presiding judge Arun Subramanian threatened to eject Combs from the courtroom after catching him repeatedly making faces at jurors in an apparent bid for interaction.', 'Here are the key takeaways from this week’s testimony.', 'On Monday, “Mia,” a pseudonymous former personal assistant to Combs who accused the mogul of raping and sexually assaulting her multiple times over the course of her employment, got back on the stand to resume cross-examination. Last week, Combs’s lawyers zoomed in on Mia’s digital footprint, drilling her about social-media posts that showed her boss in a positive light and affectionate text messages she sent after the death of his longtime girlfriend, Kim Porter. The defense seemed to suggest that being effusive on Instagram meant she couldn’t have been abused in real life. But glowing posts — particularly for Combs’s birthday — were a job requirement, Mia told the court. If she didn’t share them, “I would be screamed at, humiliated, made fun of, and my job would be threatened,” she said, per CNN.', 'Defense attorney Brian Steel also asked Mia if she ever filmed Combs in a “moment of rage,” as taking BTS footage was one of her jobs. She replied: “No, I would not have been allowed to film that.” Noting that Mia never told friends or family what was going on, Steel went so far as to ask Mia if she actually had been sexually assaulted by Combs. According to NBC, she replied, “I would not lie in this courtroom. I never lied in this courtroom; everything I have said is true.” She also added that she was “terrified and brainwashed” during her time working for Combs.', '“Nobody acted like what was happening to me was wrong,” she said, according to CNN. “He threatened to tell Cassie quote, unquote ‘everything,’ which made me feel like I had done something wrong. I don’t know how to explain what that does to a person.”', 'Part of Steel’s questioning seemed designed to suggest a “Me Too money grab”: Mia did not initially tell prosecutors that Combs had assaulted her. It took her months to come forward with those claims, and on the stand, she explained that she did not want to raise them until she had retained counsel. (Per the Washington Post, Mia hired the attorney who successfully represented writer E. Jean Carroll in her sexual assault and defamation suit against Donald Trump.) Mia insisted she had no intention of suing Combs, and she held her ground despite the weight of Steel’s skepticism. Affirming each of the allegations of abuse she’d made, she reminded the jury why victims sometimes speak positively about the people who’ve harmed them: “It’s called psychological abuse.”', 'According to CNN, security guard Eddy Garcia was on duty on March 5 when the InterContinental’s security desk received a call from Kristina Khorram, Combs’s chief of staff, asking “if there was any possible way to get a copy of the video or see the video” of an incident involving her boss earlier that day. “I told her that she would have to reach out to hotel management or get a subpoena,” Garcia testified. Khorram then showed up in person, and Garcia warned her that, while he wasn’t authorized to show her the tape, “off the record, it’s bad.” Combs’s side continued to push, and Garcia said Khorram and the mogul ultimately called him on his personal cell — a number he hadn’t given to either of them — to make their case. Combs, Garcia testified, said “that something like this could ruin him,” according to CNN. Combs also told Garcia that “he would take care of me,” Garcia alleged. Garcia then called his boss, who agreed to sell the tape for $50,000.', 'A few days later, Garcia delivered the footage to Combs on a USB drive. While Garcia assured the mogul that the original had been erased from the hotel’s servers, Garcia also expressed concern about what might happen to him if Ventura changed her mind about reporting the assault. Garcia testified that Combs then got Ventura on FaceTime and instructed her to “let him know that you want this to go away, too,” which she did. Garcia signed an NDA with a $1 million break clause and texted Combs photos of his ID, his manager’s, and another on-duty security guard’s — to ensure they were “all on the same page,” Combs told Garcia, according to the Washington Post. Garcia said Combs produced stacks of cash from a paper bag and fed them through a counter until he reached $100,000. Garcia’s cut came to $30,000. A few weeks later, Combs texted him, writing “Happy Easter my angel, God is good,” and then proceeded to ask if anyone had asked about the incident or the video, Garcia testified.', 'On Wednesday, fashion designer Bryana “Bana” Bongolan took the stand and recounted complaints she’d lodged in a December 2024 lawsuit against Combs — namely that, in 2016, he barged into Ventura’s apartment, grabbed Bongolan, and held her over a balcony.', 'Bongolan testified that she became friends with Ventura at some point in 2014 or 2015, but held off on meeting Combs for about a year. “I wasn’t really fond of what I was seeing,” she said, per CNN, citing a black eye Combs had given Ventura. Bongolan said she witnessed Combs’s controlling behavior firsthand: The mogul would often show up at Ventura’s door late at night and start banging on the door, Bongolan said, and once, he threw a knife at Ventura when she answered. On another occasion, Bongolan said she and Ventura were on a photo shoot when Combs allegedly “came up really close to my face and said something around the lines of, ‘I’m the devil and I could kill you.’” She testified that she had no idea what made him say that.', 'She also claimed to have no idea what prompted him to hold her over a balcony in September 2016. Bongolan testified that she and her ex-girlfriend had been asleep on Ventura’s couch that night when Combs showed up. Telling her partner to hide in the bathroom, Bongolan said she went out to the balcony and tried to act casual. She was about to start smoking a blunt when Combs came up behind her: Grabbing her under the armpits, “he lifted me up and then had me on top of the rail,” she recalled. Bongolan is under five feet tall and weighed about 100 pounds at the time, according to her lawsuit. She testified that, as he dangled her midair, Combs was yelling at her, “Do you know what the fuck you did?” After about 15 seconds, he hauled her back over the railing and tossed her onto the patio furniture. From that collision, Bongolan sustained a large bruise on her leg and also hurt her neck and back badly enough that she needed a neck brace, per the Washington Post. She said she was too scared to involve the police, and that when she spoke to Combs on the phone a few days later, she told him repeatedly, “‘I don’t want any problems with you.’”', 'In cross-examination, the defense focused on Bongolan and Ventura’s drug habit, which Bongolan agreed was “serious.” Combs’s attorneys leveraged her party history to suggest she may not have correctly remembered the situations she described, according to NBC. The knife incident, for example: Bongolan couldn’t explain why Combs had a knife or where it came from. “I don’t know how it happened. I just saw what I saw,” she told the defense, per the Post. The defense also pressed her on a detail that appeared in her lawsuit, but which she didn’t mention on the witness stand: That in the process of lifting her over the balcony, Combs had groped her breast hard enough to leave a bruise. Bongolan admitted that an attorney she’d hired included the claim in a demand letter to Combs, but clarified that she had fired him because the information was incorrect. But the defense kept pushing, bringing out hotel receipts that seemed to suggest Combs was in New York City during the time frame the assault allegedly occurred. “You came in here and lied to the jury, isn’t that true?” defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland challenged Bongolan, according to NBC. “I can’t agree with you,” the witness replied. “I will never forget him holding me on that balcony.”', 'Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” another of Combs’s former girlfriends took the stand on Thursday, kicking off what is expected to be days of questioning. Jane said she met Combs at a Miami yacht party in 2020 and continued dating him right up until his arrest in September 2024. Like Ventura, Jane — an influencer and a single mother — described the mogul as “larger than life” and said she fell “head over heels” for him quickly. Their first date, according to CNN, lasted five days. Shortly thereafter, Combs took her to Turks and Caicos, followed by the Bahamas, for her birthday. Whereas Jane had only taken drugs on two other occasions, she said she took ecstasy nine times during the Turks and Caicos leg of their trip alone. And at the end of their vacation, Combs offered to pay her $10,000 to make up for lost income. Although Combs told Jane he was seeing other people, “In my heart, I just wanted to see Sean, so I was monogamous,” she testified.', 'The pair kept their relationship private, but between February and May 2021, Jane said Combs paid to fly her to Miami on a biweekly basis. The couple did a lot of drugs — ketamine, cocaine, molly, and ecstasy — and Jane testified they would have sex for 12 to 24 hours at a time. In May, Combs asked her how she might feel about bringing another man into the equation. Thinking she was “playing into the fantasy,” she said, “okay.” A few hours later, Jane said she found herself in a hotel room where Combs informed her that “Don,” a man from an escort service, was coming up to meet them. Still high and “super-nervous,” Jane said she’d gone along with the situation so far “because my partner was excited and it was already happening.” Vulture reports that, when Jane asked that Don wear a condom, Combs said he didn’t want that. This refusal turned out to be a recurring theme: On several future occasions when Jane asked for a condom, she said that Combs became “almost incensed,” according to NBC: “He said he didn’t want to see a rubber while he was watching.”', 'Still, that first night, Jane testified, “it was taboo, it was fun, I had a good time with my partner.” She also assumed it would be a one-time thing. Instead, she said, it “opened like a Pandora’s box.” Combs’s interests increasingly shifted to these third-party scenarios, Jane said, until about 90 percent of their sex life involved male escorts. According to CNN, Jane testified that she only agreed because she “feared losing him.” But as time went on and she voiced her discomfort with his demands, Combs was “dismissive,” insinuating that he would break up with her and stop paying her rent if she declined. Between May 2021 and October 2023, Jane said she and Combs had “hotel nights” every time they saw each other.', 'Like Cassie, Jane said she had to keep herself groomed in a specific way in anticipation of these encounters: Straight hair, light nail polish, tanned skin. The hotel nights themselves also followed a similar pattern: The room would be set up with red lights and sheets draped over everything, Jane said, to help guard against damage from the more than two-dozen bottles of baby oil they typically used during the encounter. Combs would direct Jane and her partner through a period of “prolonged foreplay,” per CNN, which progressed to oral sex and, eventually, intercourse. Hotel nights could stretch between 24 and 30 hours, according to NBC, during which Jane didn’t get to sleep and often had sex with more than one man. Crying on the stand, she recalled Combs feeding her “multiple doses” of ecstasy in a single night to make sure she stayed awake, and refusing her requests for a break. Jane told the court that, when the drugs ran out, Combs would send his employees to buy more. On two occasions, he instructed Jane to fly with drugs, according to CNN. When Jane asked Khorram, the chief of staff, about the risks, she said Khorram assured Jane she “did it all the time” and it wasn’t a big deal.', 'Jane said that, on a few occasions, she tried to get through hotel nights without any substances, but found that “it was too real.” On one occasion when she forwent drugs, she went to the bathroom and threw up after having sex with two different escorts, NBC reports. “Sean came in and he was like, ‘That’s good, you’ll feel better. Let’s go, the third guy is here,’” Jane testified. Without the drugs, she said, she felt “repulsed” by herself.', 'As she continued seeing Combs, Jane said she devoted less and less time to her career. She felt she needed to be ready if Combs decided he wanted to see her. Combs would give her money, lump sums ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 at a time, to cover her bills, her housing, and her expenses, according to the Post. At some point, Combs proposed a contract: He would cover her monthly rent — the equivalent of about $10,000 per month, according to CNN. Although she felt like she had no choice but to go along with his demands, Jane told Combs she didn’t enjoy his hotel nights.', '“I wish we could take this back to when we first started dating,” she texted him, according to NBC. “Ever since I opened Pandora’s box, I haven’t been able to close it.” Participating in the marathon sex sessions was “dark, sleazy,and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” she continued. “It’s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for my house. I don’t want to feel obligated to perform and fear losing you. I don’t want to feel like that anymore,. I just want to talk like adults and figure where we go from here.” He reportedly responded: “Girl stop.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDNYM1JzU201VE1tUkllVXhHVFJEVkFSakFBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
Diddy Accuser ‘Jane’ Details Emotional Toll of Unwanted ‘Hotel Nights’ With Male Escorts,https://www.vulture.com/article/diddy-trial-jane-accuser-testimony-day-three.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'For weekly updates on all the most pivotal and dramatic moments from Diddy’s trial, sign up for our newsletter: Court Appearances: United States v. Diddy, and check out the rest of our trial coverage here.', '“Jane,” the third woman accusing Sean “Diddy” Combs of sexual misconduct in his Manhattan federal sex-trafficking trial, described an alleged beating in June 2024. She said the two were on a break for a few months after Casandra “Cassie” Ventura’s 2023 lawsuit but got back together earlier that year. Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym, was referring to Cassie’s November 16, 2023, lawsuit against Diddy, in which she accused him of physical and psychological abuse, as well as rape; the parties settled the suit one day after its filing.', 'What was supposed to be a romantic evening on June 18, 2024, between Jane and Diddy erupted when she assumed that Diddy’s recent absence had to do with another woman, Jane said. During the argument, Jane pushed Diddy’s head into the counter when he bent down. She threw candles and glass. “I said, ‘I hate you!’” She said she wanted to leave and locked the door to her main bedroom, but Diddy kicked it down. She locked herself in the main bathroom and Diddy kicked that door down. When Jane tried to hide in the closet, Diddy kicked down that door, too. She slipped into the hallway. “Sean kicked me from the back of my thigh and then I fell down on my butt,” Jane said. “He picked me up in a chokehold and choked me.” Diddy, still constraining Jane’s neck, lifted her up. “I couldn’t breathe,” Jane said, saying she was on her tippy toes. She wriggled out. “I just wanted to run,” she said. Jane fled the house. “I was barefoot and I ran to this wall that I knew he wouldn’t find me at.” Jane hid there for what felt like hours. She eventually headed back home, but Diddy hadn’t left, and another fight unfolded outside. She punched him and said, “I hate you!”', '“I ran to the backyard and just kept saying ‘Leave me alone,’” Jane told jurors. Diddy allegedly punched her on the forehead and around the eye area. She rolled into a ball, trying to cover her head. Diddy allegedly kicked Jane and dragged her back into the house. Jane wound up taking a shower. Diddy “started smacking me really hard in my face.” When Jane got out, she said Diddy started playing pornography on her phone. He then texted Anton, an entertainer who had participated in hotel nights with them, from this same phone. Anton came over. Jane had tried to cover her injuries with a side-swept hairstyle. “I greeted Anton, and I just tried to be polite and nice and just ask him how his day was and try to make small talk, but I could see Sean in the room just giving me this really evil stare,” Jane said. “He was like, ‘I need to talk to you.’”', 'Diddy took Jane aside. He noticed that Jane and Anton had some conversations in early 2024 and said the “text exchange wasn’t sitting well with him.” Jane said she and Anton had run into each other at a birthday party and that she saw him hooking up with someone else but that nothing untoward happened between them. Diddy told Jane to perform sexually on Anton and not to “ruin” his night. “I said, ‘I don’t want to!’” Jane said Diddy neared her face and said, “Is this coercion?” before pressuring her into taking ecstasy. As Jane recounted these moments to jurors, she patted her eyes with a Kleenex. “I had to perform oral sex on Anton. It just felt like forever.” Sean watched. “I felt so sick … I just felt disgusted. I just felt terrible.”', 'Earlier in the day, Jane described her reaction to Cassie publicly accusing Diddy of abuse in late 2023. “I’m distressed from reading all of this,” Jane said in a text to Diddy, which she discussed in her testimony on June 9. “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma.” Cassie, who testified earlier in Diddy’s trial, said that he coerced her into drugged-up, days-long sexual encounters with male escorts called “Freak Offs.” Jane, now on her third day of testimony, told jurors that Diddy pressured her into ecstasy-fueled encounters with male escorts called “hotel nights.”', 'Some time after Jane told Diddy she was distraught over Cassie’s allegations, they spoke on the phone. Portions of this conversation were played in court; it was recorded without Jane knowing and discovered on a phone seized by federal agents in spring 2024. Diddy told Jane he needed her, saying, “I’m sorry you feel this way.” He thought they were enjoying “kinky shit” together. “I’m just trying to just … stop all this madness,” Diddy said. Jane told Diddy, “Just, like, reading it all, it’s so, like, word for word.” Jane also said, “Who’s there for me when I close my eyes and I have these fucked-up things in my head?” In a subsequent conversation, Diddy tried to smooth over the situation, telling Jane he needed her friendship. “You know you ain’t gotta worry about nothing else,” Diddy said. Jane understood this as referring to her rent, which he’d been paying since mid-2023. “Please pray for me. I’m going to be praying for you,” Diddy also said.', 'Diddy visibly reacted to portions of Jane’s testimony. He pushed his chair back and shook his head as Jane described feeling used to fulfill the fallen mogul’s sexual fantasies — while he lavished attention on other women. Diddy also appeared to be oscillating ever so slightly in his chair; his back and head were moving with the almost imperceptible back-and-forth that comes with leg-tapping.', 'Jane recalled one exchange with Diddy about travel plans to New York City. She thought it would be a romantic trip. Diddy told her to send him something showing her “being bad” — referring to tapes of their sexual encounters with escorts. Jane thought Diddy was with someone else and told him to “figure out how to get your dick hard on your own.” Diddy told her, “I got the phones,” which Jane took to mean devices that had videos of their sexual encounters on them. This worried Jane because they had a specific phone for these recordings, and they were not supposed to be on Diddy’s main phones — which all of his staff had access to. Jane was also angry because Diddy had appeared on a podcast where he “bragged about sex with another woman” for “48 hours straight.”', '“I’m not coming to New York. I feel disrespected,” Jane told Diddy in a text. “It’s clear you [only] want me there to use me for a hotel binge. You have plenty of hos for that.” Around this point in Jane’s testimony, Diddy could be seen resting his head in his hand momentarily. He appeared to disagree with her statements. “I said, ‘I don’t want to be used,’” Jane recalled, referencing texts shown to jurors and read aloud in court. “‘As much as I want to see you, I don’t want to be treated like a ho in a hotel room … it doesn’t make me feel good.’” Diddy insisted she was wrong. “He said, ‘Girl, that was podcast talk. I haven’t even had sex.’”', '“‘I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights for you in fear of losing the roof over my head,’” Jane also testified she said. Diddy left her a voice note where he said “I’m sick in bed” and didn’t understand why she was making a problem. As their exchanges continued, Jane claimed that Diddy said “that he loved me, that he missed me, that he wanted to see me.” Jane decided to visit him after all. Diddy told Jane she could do a little shopping. They would go to dinner. Diddy even asked her to bring a passport. It sounded like the romantic time she’d so desperately wanted. Jane received a text mid-flight. Diddy asked her about one of the entertainers who had participated in their hotel nights.', '“He says, ‘I have a surprise, if that’s okay.’ I understood that he was going to introduce somebody new,” Jane said, breaking into tears and dabbing her eyes with a tissue. “I hated it.” After landing in New York, Jane went to the hotel. Diddy picked her up so late they couldn’t get a proper dinner; their only option was a lounge that was “almost closing.” Jane told him that she didn’t want a hotel night, and his demeanor turned defensive. “We started heading back to the hotel and he gives me a pill.” It was ecstasy. Back at the room, Jane had sexual encounters with two performers in Diddy’s presence. They didn’t do anything the remainder of Jane’s time in New York City. “We just rested, and Sean got me sick,” she said. “He gave me COVID.”', 'Diddy, who was wearing a pale-beige sweater and a white shirt, seemed like he was trying to behave well in front of jurors, despite his prior movements. When one of Diddy’s attorneys, Teny Geragos, was returning from a sidebar, he pulled out her chair and made as if helping push it back toward the table.', 'Jane has told jurors that Diddy lured her into a world of sexual encounters with male escorts under the false pretense of a romantic relationship. After Diddy wooed Jane with deeply intimate one-on-one attention for several months, she agreed to go along with Diddy’s pitch that she have sex with another man in front of him. This didn’t wind up being a one-off event, as Jane had thought. “I felt that that night just opened, like, a Pandora’s box in our relationship. It just completely set the tone for our relationship going forward,” Jane said on June 5. Diddy would soon want these encounters, which they called “hotel nights,” all the time — and he plied Jane with ecstasy so she could perform in days-long sexual events, she previously told jurors. “He would be like, ‘You’re not getting tired on me, are you? Let’s finish strong, hard. Let’s end on a high note,’” Jane recalled during her testimony on June 6.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDNYM1JzU201VE1tUkllVXhHVFJEVkFSakFBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

"At Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs trial, the women testifying are on trial too",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-06/chabria-column-sean-diddy-combs-trial-women,"['Did she scream? Was it loud enough? Was her dress torn enough to prove she fought?', 'These were some of the questions faced by 17-year-old Lanah Sawyer in 1793 during one of America’s first rape trials, which ended in an acquittal for the wealthy “rake” who assaulted the teenager.', 'As Week 4 ends in the sex trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, it’s becoming depressingly clear that the more things change, the more they remain the same — especially when it comes to how we treat survivors of sexual violence. Despite almost a decade of the #MeToo movement, the women testifying against Combs are on trial just as much as he is, and just as much as Sawyer was 232 years ago.', 'Why didn’t they leave? Why did they text Diddy friendly notes? Isn’t this all just about cashing in?', 'Once again, women are being asked to explain not just what happened to them, but why they reacted the way they did. It’s our collective ongoing need to police and scrutinize how women react to trauma, while steadfastly refusing to learn anything about trauma.', 'For a lot of folks, there is a perceived right way to react to sexual violence — crying, begging, pleading, running, fighting, shouting really loud, reporting it to police immediately. If a woman fails to conform to these narrow, male-approved reactions, well, they must be lying — or willing.', 'Case in point, Bill Maher’s recent unfunny rant about Cassie Ventura, the woman at the center of the Diddy allegations.', 'Maher, in a monologue as ignorant as it was self-assured, argued that he could understand why women in the past were hesitant to come forward with allegations of abuse and instead may have thought, “If I can’t get justice for my pain, can I at least get a receipt, a coupon?”', 'So dismissive of the real barriers women continue to face in the legal system to assume greed is why women sometimes seek civil penalties instead of criminal ones; so disingenuously classist to throw “coupon” in there, an unsubtle nod to the stereotype that victims are poor and opportunistic.', 'Sadly, Maher is far from the only one to attack Ventura. President Trump, who has been found civilly liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll, went so far as to hold out the chance of a pardon for Combs if he was convicted.', 'Maher went on to say that “things have changed enough” that women should be expected to immediately report any abuse or assaults.', '“(D)on’t tell me any more about your contemporaneous account that you said to two friends 10 years ago, tell the police right away,” he lectured. “Don’t wait a decade. Don’t journal about it. Don’t turn it into a one woman show and most importantly, don’t keep f— him.”', '', 'Ami Carpenter, an assistant professor at the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies at University of San Diego and an expert in trafficking, told me she doesn’t agree with Maher, to put it gently.', '“We have a tendency to think of victims as either deserving or undeserving of care and compassion,” she told me. And a lot of that depends on the way they present themselves.', 'In Ventura’s instance, and perhaps some of the other women who have testified against Combs, the alleged abuse went on for years. It’s likely that she and others had a trauma bond with Diddy, as do many survivors of long-term sexual violence, whether through sex trafficking or intimate partner abuse.', 'Although MAGA immigrant panic has sold us the image of traffickers being Latino cartel members sneaking girls and boys across borders, the reality is most victims are right here in the United States and know — and at one point maybe even trust — their trafficker. It’s a friend, a mentor, a guy who offers protection from an otherwise difficult life. A person like Combs, with power and money and promises of a better life.', 'And only after the relationship is formed does the trafficking start, with the abuser cycling “between abusive behavior and displays of affection or remorse,” Carpenter said, often leading the victim to a confusing, paralyzing mix of emotions that can include “sympathy, compassion and even love for the abuser.” Because that is what the abuser wants.', 'In a 2016 study, Carpenter talked to 65 sex traffickers in the San Diego area about how they controlled their victims.', '“They all, to a person, understood how to create this psychological connection to their victim,” she said. “In fact, they looked down on traffickers or pimps who, in their words, had to resort to violence because they didn’t know the power of their words. For them, it’s all manipulation, a mental manipulation. And if I extrapolate from that, and I look at Diddy’s behavior, I think it could point to him being aware of what he was doing, acutely aware.”', 'Dr. Stephanie Richard, a law professor at Loyola Law School and the director of its Sunita Jain Anti-Trafficking Policy Initiative, told me that although fight or flight is the way most people think of resisting abuse or violence, freezing and fawning are common trauma responses as well — and ones that those trapped in long-term abuse often rely on for survival.', '“A lot of victims realize that they won’t be harmed if they’re fawning,” Richard said. “And so these kind of responses are someone trying to keep them safe, because we’re all human, and you can’t live through something so terrible without doing things that protect yourself.”', 'Like agreeing with the abuser, or even sending them approving texts. Along with Ventura, at least three other women have testified against Combs or are expected to. Two, “Mia” and “Jane,” are attempting to remain anonymous, though Mia has already been outed. A third, Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura’s, testified that Combs once held her up over a balcony railing, leaving her in fear of her life, before throwing her onto nearby patio furniture.', 'During her cross-examination by Combs’ lawyers, Mia was grilled for hours about her friendly texts with Combs, and whether the abuse had really happened. Attempting to discredit testimony that Combs had once slammed her arm in a door, the defense attorney asked whether she had screamed. Sound familiar?', 'In the end, Mia explained her behavior with seven words that any survivor will understand: “When he was happy, I was safe,” she testified.', 'And that’s really what it comes down to for all women: a sense of safety.', 'Whether inside a courtroom, online, in the media or in common society, until women are certain they can be safe when they speak up — from their abuser and from the rest of us — they are trapped explaining how they survived, not just what they survived.', 'Isn’t it enough that they did, and that they’ve found the courage to try to stop that same pain from being inflicted on someone else?', 'L.A.

I didn\'t want to tell anybody,"" she testified.', '""Why did it take seven to eight months for you to tell the U.S. Attorney\'s Office about Sean Combs supposedly sexually assaulting you?"" Combs\' defense attorney Brian Steel asked.', 'It is not uncommon for sexual assault survivors to wait some time before revealing their experiences to loved ones or law enforcement.', 'Mia\'s testimony turned emotional as she was asked whether she was able to speak about Combs allegedly assaulting her without looking down while she addressed the court. Mia said she couldn\'t: ""It’s the worst thing I\'ve ever had to talk about in my life,"" she shared.', ""Mia was then asked why she chose to speak out now. She explained that she felt she couldn't help her loved ones, including her niece and goddaughters, if they were ever sexually assaulted and she had never raised her accusations against Combs."", 'The former assistant alleged during her testimony last week that the first time Combs sexually assaulted her was at the Plaza Hotel, when they were in New York City celebrating his 40th birthday in 2009.', 'In later years, Combs allegedly assaulted her several additional times, including at his Los Angeles home and on a private plane.

She said she had to be in constant communication with Combs 24/7, and even when she was away, ""I was never out of his grip.""', '""You joined the MeToo money grab against Mr. Combs, is that true?""

He pressed, ""You want money from Mr. Combs based on your testimony, is that right?""', '""No,"" Mia said.', 'Jurors saw texts from 2019, in which Mia wrote to Combs: ""I had a nightmare. I was trapped in an elevator with R. Kelly and you came to rescue me."" Kelly, a fellow hip-hop artist, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in 2022. Combs is currently facing both charges.', '""Why are you reaching out to Mr. Combs, telling him this?"" Steel asked Mia, pressing her on why, if Combs allegedly terrorized her, she would write to him in such a way.', '""Puff used to be my protector,"" she replied, adding that Combs, sometimes referred to as ""Puff Daddy,"" had recently lost longtime partner Kim Porter. ""Kim had just passed away, and I felt horrible for him,"" she said.

She replied that she didn’t think five months was a long time frame, explaining that Combs would grieve Porter, with whom he shares four children, for a lifetime.', 'Mia testified that Combs had stolen both her and Ventura Fine\'s devices on multiple occasions, and he put tracking devices on Ventura Fine\'s car. ""I\'m not sure what he\'s capable of,"" she said.', 'But Steel quickly pressed Mia on an instance in which Ventura Fine had come to her, saying that Combs was acting ""jerky."" Mia responded by saying his ""brain needed to be rewired,"" comparing him to a child throwing tantrums who needs his mother.', '""Why would you stick up for Mr. Combs?"" Steel asked, but Mia denied wanting to defend her former boss.', '""One of the worst parts"" of her job was being put in the middle of Ventura Fine and Combs’ relationship, she said, which Cassie has alleged was fraught with physical and sexual abuse. ""I wouldn’t lie to her about anything I wasn\'t forced to,"" she added.', 'Steel questioned Mia about a friendly text message exchange with Combs from 2020, years after her employment with him ended.

Diddy’s Ex Passed Out After Reading Cassie’s Lawsuit Describing “Freak-Off” Orgies,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/diddy-trial-jane-doe-passed-out-cassie-lawsuit-1236260622/,"['', '', ""The rap mogul's girlfriend until his arrest in September continued to testify on Monday about alleged abuse, gaslighting and finding her agency as the relationship declined."", 'BY KEVIN DOLAK', 'The most recent ex-girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs testified further at his sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York on Monday, detailing the deterioration of their relationship over the last few years, fainting from shock upon reading Cassie Ventura’s civil lawsuit against him and a savage beating at his hands months before the fallen mogul’s September arrest.', 'As prosecutors near the end of their witness list and get ready to rest their case, the victim, using the pseudonym Jane Doe to protect her anonymity, shared her experiences with the defendant over the back half of their three-year relationship. Last week, she told the court that about 90 percent of their time together revolved around “freak-offs” or what she referred to as “hotel nights,” which were drug-fueled orgies where she was allegedly coerced and blackmailed into having marathon sex sessions orchestrated and filmed by Combs as he looked on. ', '', 'This came after the defense team made a second motion for a mistrial, citing what they called “prosecutorial misconduct.” In a letter to the judge overseeing the case, Combs’ attorneys wrote that federal prosecutors knew that testimony from Ventura’s friend Bryana Bongolan, who told the court last week that she was dangled by Combs over Ventura’s balcony in 2016, was false but allowed her to testify before the jury anyway. Judge Arun Subramanian has said he will respond to the letter on Tuesday. ', 'From the witness stand on Monday, Jane testified further to the court of the alleged coercion to participate in hotel nights she claims to have experienced from Combs, who paid for her apartment and still does today; she said her housing felt contingent on keeping Combs happy, which she has said was always her goal in their ultimately orgy-centered relationship. ', '', '“[It was] like the home was being used as leverage,”  she said, and added that she felt “guilt-trippy things” about living in a home paid for by Combs. Jane told the court that this “made me feel like I had to perform” sex for housing. She expressed this to him in a text that described her feeling “disgusted” with herself. On two separate occasions, she told the court, a hotel night involved a man dressed as a cowboy while wearing high-heeled shoes and another involved three men, which led to her vomiting. Combs went to check on her afterward but quickly ushered her back to the “party,” she said. ', 'Jane also alleged that Combs blackmailed her with sex tapes he made of her and male sex workers at the hotel nights, telling her that he would release them in December 2023 and show them to her baby’s father. This was amid a series of fights the couple had, she told the court, as their relationship was deteriorating as she began to show more agency and tell the wealthy business leader that she did not want to have sex with other men for his pleasure. Her mental health deteriorated during this time, she said, as she began to recognize the alleged gaslighting tactics Combs used on her; at a point, she began to have suicidal ideation, she said. Jane also described a time she vomited during a session involving three men and shared her thoughts after viewing footage of her at a hotel night.', '“I saw me being high. I was following a pattern, the pattern that I thought he wanted to see,” she testified. “It was like a show over and over again.”', '', 'A man named Cabral, who appeared with her in a sex video, asked for $10,000 for the footage, which Combs had shot on the sex worker’s phone. It was eventually sold to an undisclosed publishing company, she said. ', 'The turning point for Jane seems to have been when she read Ventura’s 2023 legal filing against Combs, which was famously settled out of court the following day. Three pages of that complaint struck her sharply, she said. Jane also told the court that upon reading the suit, she fainted.', '“I feel like I’m reading about my own sexual trauma,” she said. Combs asked for her emotional and spiritual support in a taped phone call from the time that was played in court.', '“I just needed to tell you I need your friendship; you know you ain’t gotta worry about anything else, baby, please pray for me,” the mogul told her. “I will be praying for you; I need your friendship.”', 'Jane finally described on Monday a harrowing story, mentioned in the prosecution’s opening statement, of being physically attacked by Combs amid an argument they’d had after he was photographed with a woman 25 years younger than him. Jane said she referred to him as a “pedophile” and slammed his head into a marble kitchen counter. This allegedly enraged Combs, who stalked her around the apartment, kicking in four doors as she tried to flee from his attacks.', 'Describing the terror she felt on that day in June 2024, Jane said she escaped the home and lingered in the neighborhood for hours, waiting for Combs to leave.

Not long after they started seeing each other, the single mom from California said Combs began financially supporting her and pushing her to participate in marathon, days-long sexual performances with male sex workers and escorts that he “framed as love.”', 'She said she began to push back by late 2023, telling Combs he was treating her like “an animal.”', 'On Monday, Jane said she fainted upon realizing the truth of her toxic dynamic with Combs when singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed suit against him in November 2023, alleging Combs had terrorized her for years with horrific physical abuse and coerced her into degrading sexual performances. Combs settled the explosive lawsuit in 24 hours for $20 million, jurors heard earlier in the trial. The feds then began investigating him.', '“There were three specific pages that was just a harrowing reference to what I was experiencing,” Jane testified in Manhattan federal court. “I was just bewildered, just in shock.”', 'In a text confronting Combs, Jane wrote, “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma.”', 'In an audio recording played for the jury, a distraught Jane is heard telling Combs she was sick to her stomach and had been crying for three days about the suit, mirroring her experience “word for word.” ', 'Comb is heard repeatedly questioning Jane about whether she was recording the call and saying he thought “freak offs” were “kinky s–t” she enjoyed.', 'On another recording played in court, a groveling Combs tells Jane, “I need your support.”', '“Please, as a friend,” Combs is heard saying. ', 'Jane said she tried to create some distance with Combs in late 2023, feeling he was destructive to her mental health. By year’s end, she told him she was having suicidal thoughts. Around the same time, she said he started threatening to release footage of her sleeping with escorts.', 'The witness said Combs became brutally violent with her on June 18, 2024, just a few months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges. She described being savagely beaten on what was supposed to be a date night after she found out he’d dated a woman 25 years his junior and confronted him.', '“I just remember calling him a pedophile,” she said, recalling asking Combs, “If a girl can’t buy her own drinks, what makes you attracted to her?”', 'Jane said the situation quickly escalated, with her shoving Combs’ head into marble by a kitchen counter. Combs then lost it, she said, kicking doors off their hinges as Jane tried to hide from him.', '“He picked me up in a chokehold and then choked me,” Jane said, describing what Combs did after breaking into a closet where she was hiding. “I couldn’t breathe, and I was on my tippy toes.”', 'In a blow-by-blow account, Jane said she had fled the property and hid for a while. When she came back, she continued fighting with Combs, sustaining blows to her head and face.', 'Jane then became overcome with emotion, describing how Combs would summon “Anton,” a male escort they’d previously dealt with, to the property and direct her to perform oral sex with a beaten-up face.', '“I said, ‘I don’t want to!’” Jane testified, describing Combs as then coming right up to her face, holding out an ecstasy pill, and asking her, “Is this coercion?”', 'Earlier, jurors saw multiple examples of Jane expressing pain and agony to Combs about being coerced into realizing his revolting sexual fantasies, in one text, telling him, “Even on two of my own birthdays, you forced men on me for days.” In response, she said he would typically threaten to take away the roof over her head, gaslight her, or resort to “love bombing” — showering her with affection as a manipulation tactic. ', 'Jane, who the judge has ordered members of the public and media not to identify, is expected to be the final witness of three who will testify that Combs sexually exploited and psychologically abused them, with Ventura and a former assistant of Combs previously taking the stand.', 'Jane said she was still entangled with Combs and that the mogul was still paying her rent and her lawyers. She said she last met with his defense team in April and that she had been working through what happened between them in therapy for the last three months.', 'Prosecutors have charged Combs, 55, with operating a criminal enterprise from 2004 to 2024, in which his inner circle committed sex trafficking, kidnapping, arson, drug distribution, labor, and labor exploitation.

The witness, who testified under the pseudonym ""Jane"" to protect her identity, said Combs was dismissive when she told him she ""hit a mental and spiritual wall"" from trying to fulfill his fantasies.', ""Combs faces two counts of sex trafficking, two counts of transporting to engage in prostitution and one count of racketeering conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jane is the second alleged victim in the prosecution's indictment for sex trafficking charges, following Combs' long-time girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who testified earlier in the trial. In her testimony, Jane described her relationship with Combs in a way that echoed Ventura's story: an evolution from affection to manipulation, and eventually violence."", ""In an effort to maintain Jane's privacy, the court sealed all visual evidence so only the jurors and legal parties could see photos, videos and texts. The public and press could still hear audio of videos and other recordings played for the court."", '(Over the weekend, Combs\' attorneys filed a motion requesting a mistrial for ""prosecutorial misconduct"" over the testimony of a woman who said Combs dangled her over a balcony in 2016. Judge Arun Subramanian is expected to respond to the motion shortly.)', 'When Jane first took the witness stand last week, she told the jury that she began dating Combs in early 2021, and although the relationship was not public or monogamous, she fell in love with the rapper and entrepreneur almost immediately. The single mom and content creator described a euphoric first date and early romance with Combs.', 'Within a few months, Jane said, Combs opened up to her about fantasies of watching her with another man. On the stand, Jane said through tears that she agreed to try it out, but she later came to deeply regret that decision. According to Jane, the couple soon established a pattern of drug-fueled ""hotel nights"" in which she would stay up for 20 to 30 hours straight, having sex with male escorts while Combs watched, gave instructions, masturbated and recorded the encounters.', 'Jane testified that from 2021 until 2024, she told Combs many times that she did not want to keep having sex with other men. In turn, he would promise to take her on romantic trips or spend quality time together. But Jane said that again and again, Combs would ask for ""entertainment"" during their time together, including during her own birthday celebrations. Prosecutors showed many text messages between the couple, as well as notes on Jane\'s phone in which she repeatedly wrote that she felt used and lied to.', '""Anything outside these hotels, I\'m a joke to you,"" she wrote on one occasion.', 'Jane told the jury that in the spring of 2023, she and Combs verbally agreed on a ""love contract."" He began to pay her rent and support her financially. During this time, Jane said her income had decreased significantly because Combs demanded much of her time and attention. When Jane resisted or declined to participate in ""hotel nights"" — at one point telling Combs she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder— Combs would allegedly raise the subject of her rent and call her ""crazy."" In a voice memo recording played by prosecutors, Combs told Jane, ""You better get on your job"" because he was doing his — implying he expected sexual performances in exchange for the monetary support he provided.', 'According to Jane, she became worried about Combs\' excessive drug use in October 2023. Combs asked for one last ""sobriety party,"" promising he\'d get clean after — and Jane decided to participate in the ""hotel night"" without taking any illicit substances. The encounter, which lasted about 12 to 18 hours, included multiple escorts. Jane said that after she finished having sex with the second man, she went to the bathroom and threw up. Combs allegedly followed and told her she should feel better now — and he expected her to continue with a third man. Jane obliged.', '""I was just disgusted,"" Jane said through tears. ""I was just repulsed.""', 'Jane said it was not uncommon for Combs to run out of drugs throughout ""hotel nights,"" and that his assistants and security guards would bring him more when needed.

Jane would coordinate to pick up the drugs from Combs\' staff in Los Angeles and deliver the packages to him in Miami.', 'In November 2023, Cassie Ventura filed a civil lawsuit accusing Combs of rape, trafficking and assault. Combs and Ventura settled the lawsuit out of court within 24 hours. Jane said when she first read Ventura\'s complaint, she nearly fainted. ""I feel like I\'m reading my own sexual trauma,"" she texted Combs at the time, accusing him of manipulating and lying to her when he had ""exploited"" other women in the same way. In the courtroom, prosecutors played audio recordings obtained from Combs\' assistant\'s phone, which depict phone calls of Jane and Combs soon after Ventura\'s lawsuit was filed. Jane can be heard telling Combs she feels sick and manipulated, while Combs tries to soothe her by saying these are things the two of them did together for fun. Jane testified that she did not know the line was being recorded.', 'Jane told the court she did not see Combs again for a few months, though they would call and text each other. At one point, Combs threatened to show the father of Jane\'s child videos from the ""hotel nights."" Prosecutors showed messages from early 2024 in which Jane told Combs she was triggered by the mounting allegations against him and he should stop drugging and pressuring women. Jane said during this time, she had gone into debt trying to furnish her home and keep up with living expenses. She opened an OnlyFans account to generate income and eventually began seeing Combs again, though he allegedly continued to hold the rent payments over her head.', 'Jane said she was at Combs\' house in May 2024 when CNN released a video, captured on a security camera, of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.

According to Jane, Combs told her Ventura was ""a hitter.""', '""He said that that was the only time that they had physical violence like that,"" she told the jury.', 'Jane testified that a few weeks after the hotel video made headlines, she and Combs were at her home in Los Angeles spending the evening together.

SEAN COMBS’ EX TESTIFIES CASSIE LAWSUIT WAS LIKE ‘READING MY OWN STORY’,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-combs-trial-jane-freak-offs-testimony-1235359043/,"['Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage', ""Sean Combs‘ ex-girlfriend said she was in a state of shock after reading the bombshell sexual assault lawsuit that Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed against the mogul in November 2023. “I almost fainted; in fact, I think I did,” the woman told a New York jury Monday. “I just reacted like, ‘I can’t believe I’m reading my own story.'”"", 'The witness, using the pseudonym “Jane,” returned to the stand for her third day of testimony, clutching a light blue stress ball. Jane dated Combs between 2021 and 2024 and has said their relationship began as a whirlwind romance. Still, after she consented to her first freak-off a few months into their romance, she likened it to opening up “a Pandora’s box” that she was unable to shut. ', 'Reading Ventura’s 35-page civil lawsuit (which was quickly settled) was particularly jarring to Jane, she said, because just a few weeks before the complaint was filed, Jane had tried to confront Combs about the freak-offs and express her desire to stop. Earlier in the day, she read a series of texts she sent Combs between Oct. 15 and Oct. 25, 2023, in which she said that the freak-offs were “desensitizing sex for me” and that she felt “violated” after “three years of me having to fuck strangers.”', '“I’m not an animal; I’m not a porn star,” Jane said in one message. “I need a break. I don’t want to do anything. I’ve hit a wall.”', '', 'Jane has been referred to as Victim-2 in the Southern District of New York’s sex trafficking and racketeering case against the hip-hop mogul. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him.', 'Ventura’s account of the R&B singer’s decade-long relationship with Combs bore a “harrowing resemblance” to how Jane felt about her nights in “dark hotel” rooms, she testified on Monday. There were three particular pages of Ventura’s lawsuit that Jane said she felt described what she went through. “I was bewildered,” she said. “I was in shock … I just couldn’t sleep. I was reading these pages; it felt like a nightmare.”', '', 'What Jane knew as “hotel nights” were strikingly similar to the freak-offs that Ventura said she was forced into throughout her decade-long relationship with Combs. The nights would typically follow the same routine, both women said. Music pulsed in the background of a dimly lit hotel suite, which was decorated with white candles and other mood lighting. Sheets and towels covered the furniture in preparation for the numerous bottles of baby oil the woman and male escort would go through. ', '', 'Combs allegedly expected the women to take ecstasy, dress in provocative lingerie, and wear towering stripper heels as they seduced a male sex worker by pouring baby oil over their bodies until they glistened. Combs would allegedly give instructions to the women on when they should advance to the next phase of the highly choreographed sexual encounter. ', 'Jane contacted Combs three days after Ventura’s lawsuit went public, texting him that reading Ventura’s lawsuit was like reading her own “sexual trauma” that she had been trying to voice to Combs. “It makes me sick how three pages word for word is exactly my experience and my anguish, even two of my own birthdays and had me perform,” Jane wrote. “Even recently throwing up at a hotel in L.A. because I was finally sober and disgusted and felt so forced to perform back-to-back and just wanting it all to end.”', '“The sick part is you knew this was coming and you gaslit me and made me feel crazy about the sex trauma I was developing knowing you’ve been here before and this is just the sick thing that you do,” Jane added. “I feel manipulated. This was never love between us. It’s also clear that this was sexual exploitation that you feigned as love for your sick fetishes.”', '', 'In a recorded call from later that day, which appeared to come from Combs’ chief of staff Kristina Khorram’s seized devices, Combs attempts to soothe and console a sobbing Jane. However, his tone quickly shifts when Jane pushes back on the idea that the two were both were just having “kinky fun” together. ', '“That’s not how I saw things,” Jane firmly responds, prompting Combs to raise his voice and accuse Jane of recording him.', '', 'After Ventura’s lawsuit was filed and settled, Jane said she went three months without seeing Combs, but the pair communicated frequently via text and voice notes over the next month. In some of these messages, which were shared with the jury, Jane expressed her anger and frustration with Combs. In one text from Dec. 7, 2023 text, she told him, “Please stop using women for your fetish” and “leave women alone who don’t want to do those nights with you. Hire prostitutes and stop emotionally harming women who love you.” ', 'Combs responded, “You trying to set me up. This is crazy, fucking crazy, you’re recording on our phone calls?”', 'Jane denied this and told Combs he would “never understand because you’re so deep in your own lies that you tell yourself.”', 'In another exchange, Combs reached out to Jane asking if she was dating. She sent him a voice memo in response, which was not played for the jury, though they did see a text she sent soon after, “I became the side chick and sex worker in my own relationship.”', 'By the end of the month, Jane testified, she spoke with Combs over FaceTime, and he appeared to offer her compensation to help her move on. Jane said Combs repeatedly told her things like “charge me for your resentment,” “I just need you to get over this,” and, “I don’t want any loose ends.” Jane then sent Combs a text containing terms that would see him pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars.', 'Combs allegedly told her in response that she was an opportunist and a liar. Jane said she and Combs continued to bicker, and she eventually told him, “I’m going to kill myself.” Later, she texted him, “I want to die.”', 'Asked about this remark, Jane testified, “I wanted everything to go black,” adding, “I was so overwhelmed with the evil — just energy, and it was so evil. This time was very evil and dark.”', 'According to Jane, Combs also threatened to leak sex tapes of her to the father of her child. (Ventura also claimed that Combs would threaten to release explicit videos of her taken during freak-offs as a form of blackmail.)', 'Jane texted Khorram about this alleged threat, writing, “He said that he would expose me and send them to my child’s father. He has been bothering me for two months.” Jane testified that Khorram said in response that she would hide the phones that the explicit videos were on.', 'According to Jane, Khorram also suggested Jane and Combs give each other space: “I always tell him all the time to just give these things space,” Khorram said, according to Jane. “Otherwise we end up in the situation like we’re in now” (Jane said she took this to be a reference to Ventura’s lawsuit.)', '', 'After several months without contact, Jane and Combs reconnected for her birthday in February 2024, and got back together soon after in Miami. “Sean had candlelit the whole entryway to the other house, and I remember when I saw him, my heart started beating super fast and I feel like his heart was beating super fast too,” Jane said.', 'After a five-course meal and gifts, Jane said they drank alcohol and took ecstasy. At some point, Jane said, Combs asked if she wanted to have sex with one of the escorts that frequently partook in hotel nights, and Jane agreed. Asked why she agreed, Jane responded, “At this point, I’m just so used to this being the outcome of whatever we’re doing that I just accept it.”', 'Jane said there were more hotel nights after that. But Jane also testified that by early March, Combs texted her, “I would appreciate it if you could sign something for me so I could have closure comfortably.”', 'Near the end of March 2024, however, Homeland Security investigators raided Combs’ homes in Miami and Los Angeles. Jane testified that authorities also left a business card at her home that day, but she did not speak to anyone in Homeland Security.', 'Rather, Jane said, she called Combs and his security guard. At some point, Combs hired a lawyer for Jane, and Jane confirmed that Combs continues to pay for the lawyer representing her now. ', 'Not long after the raids, Jane testified that another escort she frequently had sex with during hotel nights, Sly, threatened to release a sex tape he had of them. According to Jane, Sly said he had a 35-minute video of one of their encounters, because Combs had accidentally used Sly’s phone to record it instead of his own. ', '“My heart was beating out of my chest and I couldn’t believe what he was saying to me,” Jane testified, after Sly allegedly demanded $10,000 for the tape. ', 'Jane went on to say she contacted Combs, who got his lawyers involved. While Jane tried to push back against Sly’s threats, she said she eventually received a call from an unnamed media company saying they’d bought the tape and asking her for comment. “I fainted and I called my lawyer,” Jane said. (The tape was never released and Jane said that she hasn’t spoken with Sly since.)', 'As her testimony continued, Jane revealed that she was with Combs the day in May that CNN broadcast the video of him assaulting Ventura in the InterContinental Hotel. While Jane said that Combs primarily huddled with family and friends in the aftermath, she recalled a conversation they had about the tape a few weeks later. ', '', 'Jane testified that Combs told her “that was the only time [he and Ventura] had physical violence like that.” She also said Combs told her that Ventura “was a hitter and that she would hit.” (Ventura and several other witnesses testified about numerous occasions during which Combs allegedly assaulted her.) ', 'Not long after that, Jane testified, she allegedly had a violent confrontation of her own with Combs. On June 18, 2024 — “a very terrible day,” Jane said — Combs came to her house in Los Angeles for a date night. Prior to that, Combs had been in Utah on a family trip, though Jane confronted him that night over who was actually there with him. She said she made “an assumption that he was with another woman,” and admitted to calling Combs a “pedophile” because she thought the woman he was with was about 25 years younger than Combs (though she was over 18).', 'They began to argue and at one point, Jane said she pushed Combs’ head into a marble kitchen counter, though she did not see any marks or injuries. Jane also said she began throwing candles and glass around the house and at Combs, while telling Combs she hated him. “I think he was probably cursing and calling me crazy,” Jane testified.', 'As the fight escalated, Jane said she locked herself in her bedroom. She testified that Combs kicked the door off its hinges, prompting her to run into a closet, where she said she changed out of a dress and into clothes she could run in. When Combs allegedly broke into the closet, Jane said she made a break for the front door, but Combs stopped her. ', '“Sean kicked me in the back of my thigh, and I fell down,” Jane testified. “He put me in a chokehold on the ground, lifted me up, and I couldn’t breathe, and I was on my tippy toes.”', 'Jane said she fled from the house and hid nearby for about two hours. Eventually, she made her way back to the house, assuming Combs would be gone, only to find him waiting for her on the street. “I was scared, but I was quiet and I just kept walking back to the house because I didn’t want to wake up the neighbors,” Jane said. ', 'Back in the house, Jane said, she and Combs exchanged blows. “I punched him and then he punched me,” she said. Jane testified that she did not see any injuries on Combs after hitting him in the temple. She alleged that Combs punched her twice in the head, “on my forehead and around my eye area.”', 'Jane said she ran into the backyard and fell “into a ball” on the ground, covering her head. “He started punching my head. He started kicking me. He started saying all kinds of things and just kept punching me,” Jane testified, adding that Combs accused her of “trying to take him away from his kids and family.”', '', 'According to Jane, Combs then dragged her by the hair and arm back into the house. Inside, Jane said she put on makeup and pushed her hair to the side to cover any injuries because Combs was inviting over an escort. Jane testified that Combs told her, “We’re not gonna end the night like this.”', 'Jane said that, after the escort arrived, Combs insisted she take an ecstasy pill, again claiming that Combs told her she wasn’t going to ruin his night. When Combs offered her the pill, Jane testified that she told him, “I don’t want to, I don’t want to, I don’t want to.”', 'Combs allegedly got close to her face and forcefully said, “Is this coercion?” ', 'Jane said that she took the pill. She said that she performed oral sex on the escort for what “felt like forever” and then had sex with him. “Sean was watching. I just felt disgusted. I felt terrible,” Jane said.', 'Jane said she saw Combs a few more times that summer. In late July 2024, she met him in Miami and said they stayed up all night having sex in a hotel room. At one point, however, Jane said she told Combs she was feeling tired. While Combs had allegedly told her before to speak up when she wanted to rest, Jane claimed that this time his demeanor changed. She claimed that Combs called her names and threw water bottles at her, but eventually apologized.', 'The last time they saw each other, Jane said, was the following month at Combs’ Miami home. “When we were together, we were just in our same routine, having sex and everything, then he says we should invite Don,” she said, referring to an escort. ', 'But even after that, Jane said, she and Combs continued to communicate through text. Jane even said she was supposed to go to New York City to visit him in September 2024, but the trip was called off after Combs’ arrest.', 'As her testimony drew to a close, Jane touched on how she was still processing her relationship with Combs, saying she had only been in therapy for three months. In particular, she stayed quiet about the June 2024 fight because she was “still processing that night and I didn’t want it to be a reality.” The first time she did speak up about it was during an April 2025 with Combs’ defense team. While she was not obligated to do this, Jane said her decision was “fear-based” and she “did not want to anger Sean.” ', 'Ultimately, though, Jane stopped meeting with the defense, saying she decided to choose and honor herself. “I just pray for his continued healing, and I pray for peace for him,” Jane responded when she was asked how she felt about Combs.', '', 'Earlier on Monday, Jane spoke about one of her attempts to put a pause on these highly choreographed sexual encounters with male escorts that could last upwards of two days straight. One of the October 2023 text exchanges discussed in court was prompted by a photo Jane saw of Combs on social media with one of his ex-girlfriends.', 'Jane said she was “furious” and texted Combs to arrange the encounter with his ex. Combs replied that Jane was “the only thing that’s going to put me at peace,” to which Jane said, “It’s not me, it’s the entertainment that puts you at peace.” ', 'During the text conversation, Jane told Combs, “I don’t feel like performing loveless, cold sex.” She later said, “I need a break. I don’t want to do anything, I’ve hit a wall.” And, “It’s been three years of having to fuck strangers.” ', 'Combs, in turn, promised Jane that they could spend a day together with “no strangers,” and that they didn’t have to have sex. But Jane was skeptical, texting him, “You beat the love out of us. You made it crystal clear exactly what you want me for. You’re going to spend the day … lovebombing me so you can get what you want? It’s not genuine. I’ve hit a mental and spiritual wall.”', 'Jane then told the court, “Whenever he wanted me or one of these nights, the lovebombing or persistency would start.”', 'In another set of texts Jane sent Combs that October, she told him, “You placed and paid all of these harmful men on me and risked my health. This was never love. I regret everything and all this dark toxic shit that entered my life.” ', 'Jane went on to say that Combs tried to calm her down over a phone call. She texted him afterward that she was “processing some sort of trauma and just need some healing time to get back to myself,” while adding, “I feel as your lover, I wanted to please you and destress you and I pushed through and went along with things even when deep down I wanted the night to be over.” ', 'Jane also acknowledged in a text that she knew that she “was consenting, and like you say on tape, you could never tell I was uncomfortable but being in my position I just didn’t want to let you down and in turn I let myself down.”', 'That was in reference to a phone call with Combs, during which he allegedly told her, “If anyone were to watch these tapes, they would’ve thought you were having the best time; they look like you were consenting.”', '', 'Asked by prosecutor Maurene Comey if this was true, Jane paused, and finally responded, “I’m still trying to figure that out.”', '', 'Prosecutors said they consider Jane a victim of sex trafficking by fraud. (Ventura was allegedly sex trafficked by physical force and coercion.) The single mother said she was desperate for one-on-one time with Combs and claimed that Combs would dangle the carrot of spending quality time together after freak-offs, which would rarely materialize.', 'Throughout her emotional testimony, Jane discussed the various ways Combs and his staff allegedly coerced or forced her into doing things she was not comfortable with — a dynamic that’s at the heart of the government’s case against Combs. Along with her participation in the hotel nights, this also included, Jane testified, instances where she was asked to fly with drugs for Combs. If she didn’t return Combs’ calls, Jane said she’d receive incessant calls from members of his team.', 'We want to hear it.

Sign up to get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial.', 'Today, the jurors in Diddy’s trial heard more emotionally wrenching testimony from a woman identified only by the pseudonym “Jane.” She’s one of Diddy’s ex-girlfriends — and one of four alleged victims at the center of the U.S. government’s racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking case against the music mogul.', 'Jane told jurors that Diddy forced her to participate in “hotel nights” — sexual encounters with male escorts that made her feel debased. “You treat me like an animal,” Jane said she told him in 2023. She described violent abuse, saying he once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the head. He then forced her to take drugs and perform oral sex on an escort, she told jurors.', 'Jane’s testimony is part of prosecutors’ effort to show that Diddy orchestrated a sprawling criminal enterprise to “fulfill his sexual desires.” He has denied all the charges.', 'Here’s what else you need to know:', 'Two years ago, according to prosecutors’ exhibits, Jane texted Diddy that she didn’t want to be “used and locked in a room to perform and fulfill your fantasies.” The same day, she told him she didn’t want to fly to New York to “be a hoe for the millionth time” in a hotel room. Jane said she felt obliged to “perform” sex acts that made her feel “disgusting” in part because Diddy paid her rent.', 'Jane said she fainted after Cassie Ventura, another one of Diddy’s ex-girlfriends, filed a lawsuit accusing him of rape and sexual abuse during a 10-year on-and-off relationship. Jane said she was struck by the similarities between their two accounts. “I feel like I’m reading my own sexual trauma,” Jane texted Diddy in 2023.', 'Jane described her suicidal ideation at the end of her relationship with Diddy, adding she told him she would kill herself. In text messages, she told him she believed he would “use” and “break” her. When prosecutor Maurene Comey asked why she sent those texts, Jane cried so hard that it was difficult to understand her answer.', 'In late 2023, Diddy threatened to release sex tapes of Jane and show them to her child’s father, she testified. Jane texted Diddy’s then-chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, and begged her to “talk some sense” into him, according to prosecutors’ exhibits. Khorram assured Jane “he’s not going to do anything,” Jane said.', 'Jane, facing another grueling day of questions, grew visibly anguished at key moments.', 'Her voice cracked as she told jurors about a night in 2023 when, she said, she was instructed to meet Diddy at the Trump International Hotel & Tower New York and directed to have sex with a male escort. She wiped away tears as she recalled telling Diddy she didn’t want to have sex with other men anymore. She sobbed as she recounted her reaction to Ventura’s allegations against Diddy.', 'Diddy, wearing khaki pants and what appeared to be a white long-sleeve shirt, seemed engaged in the day’s testimony. He leafed through documents in a folder this morning and regularly leaned over to chat with defense attorney Teny Geragos throughout the day. He appears to have lost considerable weight in federal detention.', 'Diddy’s mother, Janice Combs, sat in the gallery. When she entered court, her son mouthed four words in her direction: “I love you, Mommy.”', 'Jane testified today that last year she joined the OnlyFans platform, a site frequently used to create explicit content for paid subscriptions. There’s nothing wrong with a government witness creating explicit content. Indeed, the witnesses who cooperate with the government are often outright criminals. Moreover, the jury will be instructed about how to assess the credibility of a witness, and the jury instructions make no distinction among sex workers, doctors or astronauts.', 'Credibility is determined by the jurors, and they have few limitations on their ability to make that determination. So even though they shouldn’t discount Jane’s testimony because she was on OnlyFans, they still might.', 'Jane said she joined OnlyFans because she “wanted to reclaim having my independence and not rely on anyone and stand on my own two feet.” While the jury shouldn’t discount her testimony because she may have been an OnlyFans content creator, it might discount it if it finds her reason for joining OnlyFans to be not very credible.', 'One juror might think there are other jobs that would allow someone to “stand on their own two feet.” Then again, it’s entirely possible that the jury could find reclaiming one’s independence to be a perfectly acceptable, normal reason to join OnlyFans as a content creator.', 'No matter what, though, one theme of the government’s witnesses who escaped Diddy’s orbit is that they all lived lives that regular folks have a hard time identifying with.', 'Tomorrow: “Jane” is expected to return to the stand.', 'BTW: Every night during Diddy’s trial, NBC’s “Dateline” will drop special episodes of the “True Crime Weekly” podcast to get you up to speed. “Dateline” correspondent Andrea Canning chats with NBC News’ Chloe Melas and special guests — right in front of the courthouse.

What the cross-examination of one witness reveals about the Sean Combs trial,https://www.npr.org/2025/06/03/g-s1-70355/sean-combs-mia-testimony-witness-harassment,"['By ', 'Anastasia Tsioulcas', ', ', 'Isabella Gomez Sarmiento', 'Sean ""Diddy"" Combs attends an event at the Fox Theater on June 2, 2021, in Atlanta, Ga.', 'This report includes descriptions of physical and sexual violence.', 'On Monday (June 2), a former employee of Sean Combs concluded three days of testimony against the hip-hop mogul. The witness, who testified under the pseudonym ""Mia,"" worked as a personal assistant for Combs from 2009 to 2017. She told the court that Combs physically and sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions throughout that time. She also accused a member of Combs\' security team of trying to bribe her in 2023 after Combs\' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, filed a high-profile civil suit against the tycoon.', ""Mia's testimony is part of the government's racketeering conspiracy charge against Combs, which accuses him of running a criminal enterprise that facilitated and concealed abuse for two decades. Theoretically, her allegations strengthen the government's claims that Combs forcefully and violently used his businesses and employees to satisfy his own desires while creating a culture of silence around him. Mia is not one of the two women around which the government has built its case against Combs, who also faces sex trafficking charges. Those charges stem from allegedly forcing his ex-partner, Cassie Ventura, who already testified, and another ex-girlfriend (who is expected to take the stand later this week) into commercial sex acts."", 'Mia, whose facial features were not rendered by courtroom sketch artists as part of her anonymity, testified in a soft voice, looking downward, frequently crying and often twisting something that she was holding in her hands. She was continually asked to repeat her statements loud enough for the court to hear. While on the stand, Mia faced aggressive cross-examination from defense attorney Brian Steel that raised questions about the potential intimidation of future witnesses.', 'Mia said that Combs first sexually assaulted her during celebrations for his 40th birthday party in New York in 2009, shortly after she began working for him, by kissing her and putting his hand up her dress. On another occasion in Los Angeles somewhere between 2009 and 2010, she said, she was sleeping in a bedroom at his home, where she was not allowed to lock the bedroom door. Weeping on the stand, she testified that he raped her, saying: ""I was frozen. I didn\'t react. I was terrified and confused and ashamed and scared.""', 'On another occasion in Los Angeles, she said, he came into a bedroom closet where she was packing some of his clothes on the floor and that, before she realized what was happening, he grabbed her head and forced her to perform oral sex on him.', '""There was no pattern to the assaults,"" she said, and that every time she hoped that it would be the last time.', 'She said that she felt she could never say ""no"" to him. ""I couldn\'t tell him no about a sandwich. I couldn\'t tell him no about anything. And this was so much worse.""', 'She said she was ""always"" worried that he would harm her both physically and sexually, and that he occasionally threatened her, saying that he would ""tell everyone"" about the sexual incidents between them. She said to both prosecutors and during cross-examination that she had never wanted anything sexual with Combs.', 'In an incident near the island of St. Barth\'s around 2010 or 2011, Mia testified, an enraged Combs chased her around on a yacht. As she ran, she said he yelled at her: ""You better learn how to walk on water like Jesus, bitch."" She said the crew helped her escape onto a smaller boat and ashore, but that Combs ordered her to return to the yacht.', 'Mia also testified that when she and a human resources executive from Combs\' company presented him with a bill for $80,000 in unpaid overtime wages, Combs ripped it up in front of her. She said that she often worked 22 hours a day, that her boss regularly deprived her of sleep and that he could be violent — throwing a bowl of spaghetti at her on one occasion when she needed to use a bathroom before responding to a 3 a.m. request and throwing a laptop at her head on another. She said Combs also regularly humiliated her by cursing at her and delivering ""long, extended rants about how incapable and stupid I was.""', 'She said that she was afraid to go to the police, and that on two different occasions, she encountered officers who were clearly dazzled by Combs\' celebrity. Those situations, she added, confirmed her belief that ""Puff\'s authority was above the police."" She also said that she believed previously that confidentiality agreements she had with Combs were paramount.', 'She had hoped she could continue to grow her own career, particularly in television and film production, under his tutelage, and repeatedly added: ""The highs were high, and the lows were low.""', '""I knew his power,"" she testified, ""and I knew his control over me, and I didn\'t want to lose what I\'d worked so hard for.""', 'The prosecution also presented a slew of text messages and phone calls sent to Mia by Combs and his security guard, known as ""D-Roc,"" after Ventura filed her lawsuit. In one of the texts, D-Roc wrote to Mia: ""I know u didn\'t ask for anything, but I can send my sister a gift.""', 'Additionally, Mia testified that she saw and heard Combs hitting Ventura ""all the time,"" and that she saw bruising, black eyes, fat lips and other physical signs of his abuse of Ventura. On one occasion, she said, she and another government witness, stylist Deonte Nash, tried to stop Combs from attacking Ventura, and she ""thought that he was going to kill"" both Nash and Ventura. Nash also testified to this incident. She also said that part of her job responsibilities often included ""sweeping"" rooms that Combs and Ventura used for their ""hotel nights"" before housekeeping arrived, to minimize the damage.', ""During cross-examination, defense attorney Brian Steel displayed one of the most confrontational approaches Combs' team has taken toward a government witness thus far. The vast majority of his questioning was about her allegations of sexual and physical assault."", 'For hours over his first two days of cross-examination, Steel showed Mia dozens of her personal social media posts that demonstrated a public love, affection and gratitude toward Combs, asked her to read them out loud and then following with variations of the question: Is this what you would say toward a man who allegedly raped you? Steel asked this, with slight variations of wording, at least 100 times.', 'Steel also asked Mia repeatedly why she did not confront Combs or seek help, suggesting she fabricated the abuse allegations. ""I was still brainwashed,"" Mia said. She added that ""no one around batted an eye"" at Combs\' behavior. She also said repeatedly that this was a common reaction among abuse victims, but that he should ask a trained psychiatrist or psychologist for a detailed explanation.', 'Steel repeatedly asked Mia if her claims were untrue or if she was lying. He also asked her why she waited until June of 2024 — months into her many meetings with prosecutors — to disclose the alleged sexual abuse and if she was joining the ""#MeToo money grab against Sean Combs."" She denied his suggestions, saying she was only telling the truth.', ""Steel's scrutiny of Mia's sexual abuse allegations suggested he was trying to tarnish her credibility before the jury, impacting how they interpret her testimony on other topics such as forced labor and bribery. The government continuously objected to Steel's line of questioning."", 'During a break, when Mia was not on the stand, prosecutor Maurene Comey expressed concerns over Steel\'s tone and accused him of ""harassing and unduly embarrassing"" the witness. Comey said Steel was interjecting his own opinions into his cross-examination and worried that other victims following the highly publicized trial could grow fearful of testifying and facing similar treatment in the future.', ""Judge Arun Subramanian mostly disagreed with the government's characterization of Steel's tone, saying he did not find it sarcastic or offensive, but conceded that Steel needed to rephrase some of his questions. The judge repeatedly sustained many of the prosecution's objections to Steel's cross-examination."", 'Steel asked Mia about getting fired by Combs in 2017 and suggested Mia loved working for him. Mia said she was deeply upset about losing her job because her world was ""ripped away"" from her, but added that ""in hindsight, it was an awful world."" She confirmed that she obtained a lawyer with the intent to sue Combs for $10 million after she was let go, but settled for $400,000 in mediation. Mia said she did not disclose Combs\' sexual assault during that process, which took place before the start of the #MeToo movement later that year. She also spoke about her close friendship with Ventura and said she did not confide in her about Combs\' alleged abuse, even after she went public with her own allegations in a civil lawsuit in 2023.', '""I was still deeply ashamed and wanted to die with this,"" she said.', 'During redirect questioning from the government, Mia stated that posting positively about Combs on her personal social media accounts was part of her job. She testified that Combs sometimes treated her like family and other times terrified and threatened her, which made working for him incredibly challenging. She said she is not seeking money or fame from her testimony, but felt a moral obligation to speak up. When asked why she was unable to testify about Combs\' abuse without looking down toward the ground, she replied, ""Because it\'s the worst thing I\'ve ever had to talk about in my life.""', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNDNYM1JzU201VE1tUkllVXhHVFJEVkFSakFBaWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
