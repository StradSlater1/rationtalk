"Music Review: On Addison Rae’s ‘Addison,’ a new pop powerhouse is born",https://www.whec.com/ap-top-news/music-review-on-addison-raes-addison-a-new-pop-powerhouse-is-born/,"['', 'NEW YORK (AP) — The pop album of the summer is here. Addison Rae’s debut, “Addison,” is full, stuffed with bejeweled, hypnotic pop songs for the post-“BRAT” crowd. Hedonism has a new hero.', 'For those who’ve watched her rise, it’s almost impossible to believe. It wasn’t so long ago – almost exactly a year into the COVID-19 pandemic – that a young Rae went on “The Tonight Show” and taught its host Jimmy Fallon a few stiff, meme-able TikTok dance moves, then what made up the bulk of her career. It was met with almost immediate backlash, as is common for young women with viral posts. But she wielded it like a weapon: Social media celebrity begat acting roles for Rae, then a coveted collaboration with Charli XCX in the form of a “Von Dutch” remix, and now, at age 24, her final form: becoming the hyper-ambitious, hyper-femme pop star for the current moment.', 'As a full body of work, “Addison” taps into the genre-agnostic zeitgeist, where pop music appears edgy and elastic. The songs speak for themselves, from the pitch-shifted trip-hop “Headphones On” and the snapped percussion, minor chords, NSFW lyrics and vanishing synths of “High Fashion” to the Madonna“Ray of Light”-cosplay “Aquamarine” atop a house beat and its chantable, spoken chorus: “The world is my oyster / Baby, come touch the pearl / The world is my oyster / And I’m the only girl.”', 'Humor and girlhood are intertwined with less of a Sabrina Carpenter-wink and more of cheery irony. “Money loves me,” she yells on “Money Is Everything.” “I’m the richest girl in the world!” Then, a giggle and a kiss. (“Girl,” to this writer’s count, is uttered 20 times across the album. Across its 12 tracks, she is both the divine feminine and the girl next door. Often, they are one in the same.)', 'Rae isn’t reinventing the wheel here, but she is carefully pulling from her inspirations. Her story recalls Britney Spears: The pair are from Louisiana, became famous young, and recorded their unique, sensual, layered pop music in Stockholm, Sweden, in and around super producer Max Martin. There’s the earned Lana Del Rey parity, like in the “Born to Die”-channeling “Diet Pepsi,” echoes of Charli in the bouncy opener “New York,” and tinges of ethereal Enya production on the dreamy “Summer Forever.”', 'For “Addison,” Rae partnered with two primary collaborators – Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd, who goes simply by Elvira – an unusually small team for a major label pop release. But that intimacy is one of the album’s superpowers, a sensibility that teeters between close mic recordings and big late-night anthems. In the latter case, look no further than “Fame Is a Gun,” an easy song-of-the-summer contender, a sunglasses-in-the-club banger with synthetic vocal textures and an unignorable chorus.', 'In the lead up to the release of “Addison,” Rae has positioned her early TikTok fame as a means to an end. There aren’t many avenues to Hollywood from Lafayette, Louisiana, and social media, for some, is a democratizing tool. Rae used her dance training to build a name for herself on the platform, something that has no doubt laid an ideal foundation for pop superstardom – just consider how Justin Bieber did something similar with covers on YouTube not so many years ago. It feels full circle, then, that Rae’s stellar debut album aims to do what her videos on TikTok attempted to do, what she’s always wanted to do — dance, and get others to dance, too.', '', 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Rae, a former cheerleader from Louisiana, is living out her nostalgic ""noughties"" dream — and she’s making music that captures that feeling.', 'On Addison, Rae serves up her now signature trip-hop meets synth-pop sound. “Diet Pepsi,” Rae’s first release since 2021’s “Obsessed,” marked a turning point in the young star’s career: It showcased Rae’s artistry at its most sophisticated. Addison’s 12-song tracklist, through its exploration of fantasy, fearlessness and doing what feels good and right for you, solidifies Rae as both a student of pop divas past and the genre’s latest “it” girl.', '“‘Addison’ is out now and alive everywhere in the universe for you to receiveeeeeee!!! This is my most personal and intimate possession,” she captioned an Instagram post. “Making music is vulnerable, energetically sensitive, electric, gratifying, challenging…… pure magic. I am unbelievably proud.”', 'At midnight on album release day, Rae debuted her sixth single along with the song’s accompanying music video. Showcasing Rae at her most vulnerable, “Times Like These,” which delves into her past and current tribulations, sounds like something you’d hear in a Josh Schwartz teen drama from the 2000s.', 'Hours before Addison hit streamers, Rae performed a private show at the Box in New York City, where she played the album’s singles and previewed some previously unreleased tracks. She then stopped by a Matchaful to unveil her limited edition “Summer Forever” drink with the café.', 'Early listeners have spoken: The album is filled with bangers.', '“The very fact that addison rae just released a skipless debut album and managed to carve out a signature sound and artistic niche for herself in the oversaturated climate of today’s music market,” one fan named Vidya wrote on X.', '“Imagine I just told you that there was a female pop album that just dropped, that talks about familial love, the general angst and confusion you feel in your twenties and radical acceptance, and did it in a way that was really artistically intelligent,” a TikTok user named Sam said. “Now, imagine I just told you that was Addison Rae.”', 'Another X user raved about Rae’s song “New York,” writing, “obsessed with everything about this track. her starting her debut album with the phrase ‘take a bite of the big apple,’ not only referencing new york but also adam and eve and the beginning of human civilization.. like there’s LAYERSSS. addison rae you are a genius.”', 'In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1, Rae discussed how precious Addison is to her, and how she wants to give the album its moment.', '“I think I’m in the space right now where I’m just really anticipating it coming out, and I’m like, trying to hit all the stops,” she said ahead of its debut. “And even with posting and feeling like, ‘Okay, well, I really want to make sure I give this the credit and the energy that it deserves.’ I think sometimes I shy away from that because I’ll be like … ‘Is it going to be too much if I’m just like, ‘Alright, everybody! The album’s this many days away’ … Sometimes I get onto myself about that and I’ll be like, ‘No, it deserves that.’”', 'Focusing on her passions was more of a risk than a given.', '“I just had this really strong intuition and gut feeling that, as unrealistic as it seemed, I needed to do it — there’s no time like now to try and chase those dreams,” she told Elle earlier this year of her decision to pursue music.', 'The pursuit of those dreams seems to have paid off. Long before she was lauded as a pop princess, Rae was a mainstay on the video-sharing platform, TikTok.', 'The Louisiana native first joined the app in July 2019, where she posted a slew of content that ranged from TikTok challenges to dancing and lip-synching videos. She racked up a million followers within a matter of months and made the decision to leave Louisiana State University shortly after. The rest, as they say, is history. Rae made her film debut with 2021’s He’s All That, the same year she released “Obsessed.” She starred in the horror flick Thanksgiving in 2023, three months after dropping her EP AR, which features the Charli XCX-assisted track “2 Die 4.”', 'The release of Addison comes a year after Rae famously collaborated with Charli on the “Von Dutch” remix. From there, she went on to garner widespread acclaim with the debut of her first major single “Diet Pepsi,” a hypnotic, synth-pop track about young lust, in August 2024. The song’s release was accompanied by a black-and-white video conceptualized by Rae herself.', '“I think even going [and] watching old movies, and appreciating them for what they are, and how strongly you had to communicate through a black-and-white video, for people to take their time and watch it,” Rae told Lowe of making the video. “And I think the song deserves that treatment of like, ‘I get it. You’re gonna have to focus really hard on it,’ but I want you to have to focus really hard on it to get it.”', 'Suddenly, after “Diet Pepsi,” it felt as though Rae was inescapable. She joined Charli onstage during her “Sweat Tour” stop at New York City’s Madison Square Garden that September before dropping “Aquamarine,” her single about transformation and rebirth, in October, followed by its remix “Aquamarine/Arcamarine” in November.', 'Rae ushered in the new year with the release of her third single off the album “High Fashion” in February 2025. On the track, Rae sees no appeal in embarking on a drug-fueled bender and instead opts for the finer things in life: a closet full of couture. She sings, with her soft, atmospheric vocals atop a darker, synthier sound, “I don’t need your drugs/I’d rather get high fashion.”', 'After gracing the cover of Vogue France, the singer dropped her fourth single in April 2025. With “Headphones On,” Rae gives listeners a peek into how she relies on music as an escape from crisis and reality. The 24-year-old singer then reunited with Charli XCX at Coachella, where she performed the “Von Dutch” remix.', '“Fame Is a Gun,” Rae’s fifth and final single — and music video — ahead of album release day, hit streaming platforms in May 2025. The track’s artwork is a photo of a young Rae posing with sunglasses indoors, likely a nod to the fact that Rae has always been drawn to living a glamorous life.', 'Rae’s album, more than anything, is about arrival.', '“It’s arrival to who I feel like I’ve become,” she told Lowe. “I’ve experienced all these trials and ups and downs, and great high moments to land here.”', 'Whether you’re a fan of Rae or a fan of music in general, Addison reflects an undeniable truth: We’re watching an artist come into her own before our eyes.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Addison Rae Became a Full-Blown Pop Star at The Box in New York City,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/addison-rae-became-a-full-blown-pop-star-at-the-box-in-new-york-city,"['Last night at the iconic New York City burlesque club The Box, Addison Rae became a full-blown pop star.', 'She emerged on stage at the Spotify-hosted party/performance of her new album Addison on a vertical bed, under shimmering sheets. A gay person in front of me murmured to a friend, “Have you ever seen Hairspray?” More likely, it was a callback to Britney Spears on her 1999 Rolling Stone cover. Rae sang the first verse of “Fame Is a Gun"" under the covers, ending on the ill-fated declaration: ""I always wanted more.""', ""The covers are stripped away, and she's revealed to be handcuffed to the bed in her underwear — leaving us in the front row seat as she goes down in history. “Nothing makes me feel as good as being loved by you,” she admits, or admonishes, or openly mocks."", 'On June 6, Rae took the stage to perform songs from her new album for the first time; the seven-song set included “Fame is a Gun,” “High Fashion,” “Aquamarine,” “New York,” “Headphones On,"" “Diet Pepsi” and “Times Like These.” Amid outfit changes and simple props — the bed turned into a mirrored surface a la “Two Stars” from Camp Rock — Rae was giddy energy and sensual movement and commanding stage presence.', 'I thought back to her surprise appearance on the Sweat Tour last September, when Rae joined Charli XCX and Troye Sivan to perform “Diet Pepsi” for the first time. In her white tulle tutu and bra top, with the approval and encouragement of Charli and the breathily euphoric “Diet Pepsi"" in her catalog, the signs of forthcoming pop stardom were all there.', 'But the Spotify performance crystallized it, the screaming crowd, the dancers in cut-offs and lingerie, the celebrities in the wings — Julia Fox, Lola Tung, Amelia Gray, Clairo, Jade, Conan Gray — the media clamoring for a look over the packed balcony. The deliciously sweaty atmosphere of naughty pop music, of witnessing a star come into her power on stage for the first time.

The Emancipation of Addison Rae,https://www.vulture.com/article/addison-rae-debut-album-review.html,"['', '', '', 'The influencer pop sphere is, mathematically, a graveyard with more misfires than successful conversions of internet cachet into hit parades. The same machine that helped Troye Sivan and Benson Boone evolve also yields terrible singles by controversial beauty-industry personality James Charles. When TikTok star Addison Rae first dipped her toe into pop in 2021, she seemed destined for the latter bucket. Her first single, “,” didn’t register as the satire she intended, as people assumed the dancer, now suddenly a singer, was deeply conceited. But in pop, with the right ideas and co-signs, the bubbliness and determination people came to resent in Rae’s TikTok demeanor are common currency. On her 2023 EP, she worked with up to five co-writers per song and producers who bathed her wispy, inviting voice in familiar dance-pop tropes. Its bops quietly succeeded where Rae’s dalliances in makeup and movies floundered. She has spent the interim workshopping a sound worthy of words of encouragement from Charli XCX and Ariana Grande.', 'Her debut album, Addison, doesn’t seek simple portfolio diversification. It stages a symbolic break with the past. This is her thing now. She’s dropping the Rae, her middle name. Her parents, frequent fixtures in her early content but more recently in tales of gallivanting with 20-somethings, are notably silent. Addison documents a 24-year-old budding artist coolly working out what even to sing and write about. Unlike her EP, the album is the work of merely three composers: Addison and Max Martin affiliates Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd. It’s refreshing and light not just thanks to the sunny, southern ersatz-cheerleader disposition that made Addison famous but also to three young women’s trust and relative freedom from industry veterans’ nagging, predictable oversight.', 'Addison is a high-stakes show of being low-key. Its lyrics revel in agency and possibilities, landing like metatextual reflections on Addison’s overarching professional pivot. “Aquamarine,” a Europop thumper, sounds like sultry Madonna fan service. But beyond the Ray of Light reference, there’s a sense that the hook — “Honey, dive into me / I’m not hiding anymore” — addresses a question that has nagged her career so far: What emotional depth is there to be found in the work? The maudlin “Times Like These” opens by mulling over outfits that would titillate a partner, but it turns into a venting session about being perceived by millions; her song’s on the radio, she sings, but she worries about the velocity of her life ramping up where others celebrate. The writing is all very slight, but the gains over earlier outings are felt in songs like “Money Is Everything,” a trap-pop spend-it-if-you-got-it jam. “Money” gets close to the concept of “Obsessed.” Here, melodrama and misandry merge in lyrics and a performance drenched in the giddiest disbelief about smoking weed with Lady Gaga. pushes to take itself less seriously, a wise adjustment for the singer famously roasted in 2020 for refusing to stop recording herself to greet her fans. The best songs paint vibrantly on a relatively blank musical slate; the others chase prefabricated styles.', 'The parallels to Britney Spears are loud. Both Louisiana singers luxuriate at the point where a whisper becomes a coo; both have crafted gossamer pop with Swedish producers. The blonde-bombshell bedlam in ’s “Fame Is a Gun” video resembles the behind-the-scenes drama and starry blue wallpaper of “Lucky,” while “In the Rain” conjures the drum-heavy hip-pop of Britney’s Neptunes collaborations. (A notable difference is that the teenage Spears was not in control of these concepts the way Addison expresses a take-charge approach to her art and image.) Elsewhere, “Summer Forever” and “Diet Pepsi” bask in the heavy reverb and anesthetized upper-register sigh of Lana Del Rey’s “Blue Jeans” and “Summertime Sadness.” These songs fall back on Rae-era propensities, flexing the internet personality’s instinct for a cresting trend but failing to do better than the real Lana songs and knockoffs flooding the market. They abandon the mission of creating some distance between this pop iteration and the Addison who blew up doing lip syncs. More enticing are the songs angling to eke out an insistent literary voice and impactful but playful sonic imprint.', 'Even when a lyric can use more time in the oven — take “Times Like These” waving off Addison’s anxiety with a humdrum refrain of “In times like these it’s, it’s how it has to be,” or the vague “Life’s no fun through clear waters” line in “Headphones On” — it feels bespoke. Wrapped up in the appeal of TikTok is the idea that everyone is one consequential view away from fame. Addison found her creative bearings in the incentivized piggybacking of this maelstrom. Escaping means finding out and sharing with the world what she’s really like and not just highlighting things she enjoys that she hopes you will, too, as influencers do so well. She’s not trying to write herself into autoplaying after the Spotify chart toppers in “Times Like These” or “Headphones On.” She’s looking for language that speaks colorfully to a unique status as a newly recertified It Girl. “Fame” and “High Fashion” have a blast with being an internet punching bag, the former sneering about how little Addison has to do to generate negative press and the latter joking that she cares more about shoes than you. “When you shade me,” “Fame” admits, “it makes me want it more.”', 'It’s like she got dragged just enough to know not to come on too intensely, except where there’s humor to be wrung from embodying the vapid L.A.-to-LA gloryseeker we had her pegged as. Addison has always wanted in on her own joke, and the album delivers a few of the funniest attacks on her old shtick in the name of building a new persona from those foundations. She cusses and smokes and gets that, not so long ago, people didn’t think so much of her. Addison finds that emancipatory. There’s no library of expectations yet. Each single hit like a pleasant shock, and the album succeeds in advancing their agenda of upending any lingering feeling that Addison’s mostly good for an eight-count and a smile. If she wants to push herself as a writer, getting deeper than just wishing her parents hadn’t gotten divorced, and maybe interrogating the finer quirks of parasocial relationships between audiences and personalities, the road to a sustained pop tenure is open. If she doesn’t care to do any of that, then is something cool for the summer.', 'Already a subscriber?

The former TikTok star who rose to popularity with her dance videos had broken the code. She released a hit.', 'What followed was a rebrand of sorts. She was featured on a Charli XCX remix, took the stage with Arca at Coachella, and continued to release singles, alongside high-concept music videos, throughout the year to prepare fans for her self-titled debut-album release. I would argue the 24-year-old used the past year to find her footing — but do we know her any better? Even after listening to 33 minutes of Addison, we’re not too sure. Nonetheless, we had to commemorate the moment by listening to the album first thing this morning and talking about it with one another on Slack. Here’s what the Cut team thought.', 'Brooke LaMantia, editorial assistant: What are everyone’s initial thoughts on the album?', 'Julia Reinstein, morning blogger: Opening with “New York” is so good. I am floating!', 'Bianca Nieves, senior shopping editor: “New York” is her “Party in the U.S.A.” It was a strong start, but then I got a bit bored.', 'Emily Leibert, writer: Aside from the singles she released (and there were too many, in my opinion), it has a 2000s Whoa, Nelly! lying-in-the-grass sound.', 'Brooke L.: It did feel like I had listened to half the album already.', 'Emily L: Of the new songs on the album, “Summer Forever” and “In the Rain” are my favorites, but they do not hold a motherfucking candle to “Diet Pepsi” or “Fame Is a Gun.” Dreamy lyrics, naked-on-the-beach vibes, pop girl from Louisiana … I get it.', 'Brooke Marine, deputy culture editor: “In the Rain” feels like a Janet-type beat.

Do we understand who she is now?', 'Emily L.: I think her creative team did an incredible job of curating a neon-pink, sepia-toned, photos-on-film aesthetic of an album. Do we know Addison any better because of it? I don’t think so. This feels like a sonic mood board, not a cohesive statement about an artist.', 'Julia R.: She is unknowable, and I am okay with it.', 'Brooke L.: I mean, she is 24. “Times Like These” felt like the most we’ve learned about her even though they were pretty generic feelings, like “I’m so confused” on a loop. Which, fair.', 'Emily L.: The things I know about Addison at this point are she likes making out in the car, she likes when her lips reflect off his cross gold chain, and she likes crying in the rain.', 'Brooke L: What music video are we most excited for? I can’t wait to see “New York” through her lens.', 'Julia R.: She’s already put out so many videos! Like half of this album was already a single.

Just like “Diet Pepsi,” “Headphones On,” and “Fame Is A Gun” led us to believe, the project features a vibrant-yet-moody collection of songs that name Rae’s foremothers in pop music.', 'Rae’s references are more than just sonic, however, as the singer also pays tribute to some of the most iconic It girls of yore on “Money Is Everything.” In the song, she singles out four pop-culture icons who defined their respective generations while highlighting her not-so-subtle aspirations to do the same.', 'MADONNA', 'In the first (and only) verse, Rae sings, “I drink on the nights that I want to remember / And when I’m out dancing / Please DJ play Madonna.” The line not only expresses Rae’s desire to hang out with the Queen of Pop herself, but doubles as a reference to the Madonna track “Music,” which opens with a request for the DJ to “put a record on.”', 'As a whole, the track simultaneously serves as an ode to the finer things in life à la Madge’s “Material Girl.” Rae giggles at the thought of making money before musing on the possibility that it can, in fact, buy happiness. “When I was growing up / Momma always told me to save my money / So I never had to rely on a man to take care of me / But money’s not coming with me to heaven and I have a lot of it / So can’t a girl just have fun?,” she wonders. By the end of the track, she’s practically screaming about how much money loves her. “I’m the richest girl in the world,” she declares.', 'LANA DEL REY', 'Rae also calls out Lana Del Rey in the following line, “Wanna roll one with Lana.” As a longtime fan (the 24-year-old has been lip-syncing to Rey’s videos since her TikTok days), Rae doesn’t just aspire to partake in a smoke sesh with the “High By The Beach” singer — she wants to be on a first-name basis with the artist. This becomes especially clear in the final line of the verse, “And the girl I used to be is still the girl inside of me,” as Rae hints at an inability to silence her inner fangirl.', 'LADY GAGA', 'Rae follows up the Lana lyric with a line about wanting to “Get high with Gaga,” which could read as a desire to be on Gaga’s level creatively, artistically, and, yes, even financially.', 'MARILYN MONROE', 'Embedded in the chorus is the final tribute to the original It girl, Marilyn Monroe. Though Rae doesn’t actually utter the name on the album, she does call out Monroe by her birth name, Norma Jeane. “Diamonds are my best friend / Like I’m Norma Jeane,” she sings, referencing Monroe’s performance of “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” in the 1949 film, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes — the very same movie recreated in Madonna’s “Material Girl” music video.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

A gay person in front of me murmured to a friend, “Have you ever seen Hairspray?” More likely, it was a callback to Britney Spears on her 1999 Rolling Stone cover. Rae sang the first verse of “Fame Is a Gun"" under the covers, ending on the ill-fated declaration: ""I always wanted more.""', ""The covers are stripped away, and she's revealed to be handcuffed to the bed in her underwear — leaving us in the front row seat as she goes down in history. “Nothing makes me feel as good as being loved by you,” she admits, or admonishes, or openly mocks."", 'On June 6, Rae took the stage to perform songs from her new album for the first time; the seven-song set included “Fame is a Gun,” “High Fashion,” “Aquamarine,” “New York,” “Headphones On,"" “Diet Pepsi” and “Times Like These.” Amid outfit changes and simple props — the bed turned into a mirrored surface a la “Two Stars” from Camp Rock — Rae was giddy energy and sensual movement and commanding stage presence.', 'I thought back to her surprise appearance on the Sweat Tour last September, when Rae joined Charli XCX and Troye Sivan to perform “Diet Pepsi” for the first time. In her white tulle tutu and bra top, with the approval and encouragement of Charli and the breathily euphoric “Diet Pepsi"" in her catalog, the signs of forthcoming pop stardom were all there.', 'But the Spotify performance crystallized it, the screaming crowd, the dancers in cut-offs and lingerie, the celebrities in the wings — Julia Fox, Lola Tung, Amelia Gray, Clairo, Jade, Conan Gray — the media clamoring for a look over the packed balcony.

Addison Rae Strips Down to Her Lingerie While Performing at Album Release Party: ‘Freedom’,https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/addison-rae-stuns-in-lingerie-at-album-release-party-performance/,"['Addison Rae is an advocate for dancing in your underwear.', 'Rae, 24, left little to the imagination while performing at a Spotify release party, for her debut album, Addison, held at The Box in New York City on Thursday, June 5. As she got on stage, Rae put on a sexy show in a nude push-up bra featuring satin cups and barely-there straps.', 'She teamed the lingerie with itty-bitty panties that exposed her cheeks and were also designed with the same fabric. Rae drew just the right amount of attention to her legs by wearing shimmery fishnet tights and black patent leather pumps.', 'For glam, she opted for sultry eye makeup, including smokey eyeshadow and long lashes. She overline her pout and donned pink lips. The TikTok star’s honey blonde tresses were parted to the side and styled in messy waves, which she flipped around on stage.', '', 'Elsewhere during the show, Rae changed into a long-sleeve crop top complete with a knot detail on her chest. She teamed the Y2K look with low-waisted micro shorts equipped with red floral pockets. She made the look even more girly with a white feathered boa, which she wrapped around her microphone stand.', 'Rae also rocked a sheer dress during her concert, finished with long, flowing sleeves, a plunging neckline, a cutout over her chest and a pleated skirt.', '', '', 'Following her show, Rae took to Instagram on Friday, June 6, to share pics from her routine.', '“First show.

The kaleidoscopic pastiche of Addison Rae’s arrival,https://www.melodicmag.com/the-kaleidoscopic-pastiche-of-addison-raes-arrival/,"['Date:', 'Who could have predicted that Addison Rae, the queen of pandemic-era TikTok and subject of one of the internet’s most memorable cringe-fuelled videos, would emerge as the preeminent rising pop diva of 2025? But sure enough, Rae has arrived in every sense of the word. In the era of unerasable digital footprints, she has accomplished the impressive feat of transitioning from social media starlet to serious pop superstar — and has done so with relative seamlessness. Her full-length debut Addison, out today, is a bite-sized pastiche of bubbling, kaleidoscopic pop that whirs, purrs and aggregates moods, images, and feelings with ease. Rather than teetering into obvious copy-paste territory, the album succeeds in the spaces in between its references, in effect delivering something that feels both familiar yet fresh. ', 'But five years after her name entered the pop culture lexicon, who is Addison Rae? In some corners of the internet, she is a master of pop cultural propaganda with a talent for convincing the masses of her artistic merits. If you were to ask Rae herself, she’d likely say that she’s just a Southern girl who’s always had dreams of making it big in entertainment. She also might say that the Addison Rae of today is who she’s been all along. As she told Interview Magazine last summer, “Girl, nobody’s rebranding. This is me.” More recently on the New York Times Popcast, she’s claimed that her TikTok grind was never the goal, but was merely a way for her to gain enough exposure to achieve her entertainment dreams. It’s often said that the truth lies in the middle of two sides of a story, and it’s safe to assume that this notion applies to Rae. Propaganda master or not, her music is good enough to speak on its own. ', 'Across 10 full-length songs and two interludes, Rae navigates sharp thematic and sonic turns with admirable agility. She bounces from languid lust (“Diet Pepsi”) to cheeky sarcasm (“Money is Everything”), creating pendulum swings that keep the listener engaged without pause for the album’s 33 minute duration. From the first thud of album opener “New York,” which bounces off the eardrum superbly, to the seductive slink of “Headphones On” and “Times Like These,” it’s evident that Rae is a dedicated student of pop (as all aspiring pop stars should be). She fluctuates from loose Lana Del Rey-esque gloom (“Diet Pepsi”) to a closing three-track run that invokes touches of soulful ‘90s house and R&B. “Times Like These” and “Headphones On” land somewhere in between the warm, R&B sounds of Madonna’s Bedtime Stories and the cooler, cinematic electronic landscape of Ray of Light. But Rae’s allusions to her pop foremothers manage to come off in a way that evades blatant duplication, and instead land as earnest homages. ', 'The record’s production cocoons Rae’s lyrical efforts that may occasionally land slightly off kilter, but are even more often undeniably fun. Lines like, “when I’m up dancing, please, DJ, play Madonna/Wanna roll one with Lana, get high with Gaga,” jump out upon first listen but capture Rae unabashedly exploring her craft instead of grasping at lyrical straws. ', '', 'But among all of the album’s delicious references and quirky admissions, it’s Rae’s hunger that is the biggest treat to hear. On one of the record’s greatest feats,“Fame is a Gun,” a bubbling pop bounce seasoned with glitchy inflections, she makes her ambitions clear. As she sings on the second verse, “There’s no mystery, I’m gonna make it, gonna go down in history/Don’t ask too many questions, God gave me the permission/And when you shame me, it makes me want it more.” Moments like these, when she breaks the fourth wall and plays into the narrative of how badly she wants to make it, add a piece to the puzzle of her persona, and in retrospect make all of the paparazzi stunts and creative COVID-19 masks make sense. If nothing else, the girl knows how to keep people talking — and isn’t that all you need to launch a pop career these days?  ', 'Rae’s earnestness is no doubt a key part of what’s gotten her to this point. How can you not take fondly to a 24-year-old girl from Louisiana with unmistakable Southern charm not far off from fellow Lousianan Britney Spears? Where other current pop girls have taken the same approach of packaging collected aesthetics and sounds into their own (recent memory calls back to Camila Cabello’s C,XOXO), the difference is that Rae’s pursuit of pop’s top tier isn’t a hard sell. Whether it be a genius creative team behind her or that indescribable “it” factor driving her smooth transition into the big leagues of pop, it’s safe to say she’s pulling it off. Put plainly, she makes it look easy.', 'In a discussion earlier this year about Rae’s pursuit of fame and creative worthiness, a friend of mine put it plainly: “at least you can tell she wants it.” And really, what more can we ask of our pop stars than to want it?', 'Keep up with Addison Rae: Instagram // TikTok // YouTube // Website', '', '', '', '', 'SHARE POST:', 'More from Author', 'Independent and fueled by love and dedication.

Addison Rae Is Here to Stay: Inside Her Album Release Party at NYC’s The Box,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a64993189/addison-rae-debut-album-review-takeaways-live-performance-the-box/,"['The singer celebrated the release of her first full-length effort with a euphoric live concert produced in partnership with Spotify', ""Every product on this page was chosen by a Harper's BAZAAR editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy."", 'Late on a Thursday evening in a burlesque-inspired nightclub called The Box, a gaggle of gays and girls gathered to see Addison Rae perform songs from her debut album, Addison, live for the first time.', 'Co-hosted by Spotify, the event was simultaneously understated and fabulous—a perfect representation for Addison (who recently proclaimed that she wants to drop “Rae”) as an artist. Acrobatic dancers hung from the ceiling and waiters walked around with platters of tuna tartare, while at the same time, attendees sipped from “Diet Pepsi”-inspired cocktails and plastered glitter and stick-on gems onto their faces. It was like getting ready for a rave in your friend’s bedroom, but that bedroom happened to be an exclusive New York City nightclub.', 'It’s not often that a pop star generates this much excitement before their debut album even drops. In the past few years, we’ve been spoiled with so much new young talent, from Olivia Rodrigo to Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. You would think that there might not be space for another voice to break through. But like how Lindsay Lohan managed to crack her Spring Fling crown into enough pieces for her classmates in Mean Girls, the pop royalty crown is always big enough to welcome newcomers when a worthy voice rises up.', 'Before she was singing in front of cheering crowds, Addison famously got her start on TikTok, where she quickly became one of the most-followed figures on the app, thanks to her dance videos. Her popularity ultimately inspired her to drop out of college and sign with a talent agency in 2020—then came the podcasts, acting opportunities, and high-profile appearances on late night talk shows.', 'Her first foray into music was with her 2021 single “Obsessed,” which was released to mostly unfavorable reviews. “I felt a little beaten down,” Addison said in an interview with The New York Times’s Popcast last month. “I was like, ‘Oh wait, I can’t just have fun and explore. People are not gonna allow that. I have too many people giving an opinion on this for it to be as free as I want it to be.’ It definitely hurt. I kept writing though.”', 'After a somewhat clumsy but inoffensive start, Addison knew she needed to come back stronger. Two years later, she dropped the EP AR, which featured infectious bubblegum hits like “I Got It Bad” and a cover of the unreleased Lady Gaga song “Nothing On (But the Radio).” Proving she had the chops and the starry friends to back them up, Addison even recruited Charli XCX to feature on the song “2 Die 4” (a year before brat summer took over the cultural zeitgeist).', 'Then, Addison took it up another level when she released the first single from her debut album, called “Diet Pepsi.” The moody, sensual track became her first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was named one of the best tracks of 2024 by outlets like Pitchfork, Billboard, Rolling Stone, and more. In the months following, Addison kept the momentum going by releasing a string of equally compelling and progressively kooky singles: “Aquamarine”; “High Fashion”; “Headphones On”; “Fame Is a Gun.”', 'All of this buildup came to a peak on Thursday evening, when the singer stepped out for a mini show in front of fans and fellow artists who came to support, like Clairo and Conan Gray. Throughout her seven-song set, Addison sang her string of singles, while debuting two as-yet unreleased ones, all the while doing multiple outfit changes, dancing through intimate set designs, and commanding the audience with ease. Fans screamed along to the lyrics and filmed with their phones—often shakily as they were too busy dancing along to the tracks. The show was sweaty, silly, and euphoric. And if there was one thing I couldn’t stop thinking throughout it, it was: The next big pop star has been born.', 'By the time I left, the clock had already struck midnight, meaning Addison was out for the rest of the world to hear. I immediately put my headphones on and started listening. I listened multiple times, in fact, before I went to bed, and I’ve had it on repeat in the hours since. It’s hypnotizing and intriguing. Some of the songs feel simple, but the more you sit with them, you realize they’re so smart. It’s funny, emotional, and romantic. I don’t mean this lightly when I say: It’s one of the best opening statements I’ve heard from a pop star in years. Ahead, I share my five biggest takeaways.', '', 'If there’s one thing that the biggest pop girls of today posses, it’s a good sense of humor. And like Sabrina, Chappell, and Charli, Addison is unafraid to imbue a bit of comedy into her songs. We’ve already seen her ability to turn a cheeky phrase thanks to the single “High Fashion,” where Rae claims that she doesn’t need drugs, she’d rather “get high fashion.” But some of the newly-unveiled tracks are especially funny, like “Money Is Everything,” where Rae opens the song with a spoken word intro like something you’d hear on an early Britney track: “When I was growing up / Mama always told me to save my money / So I never had to rely on a man to take care of me / But money’s not coming with me to heaven / And I have a lot of it / So can’t a girl just have fun?” Even some of the more somber songs have a tinge of humor to them, like “In the Rain,” where Rae dramatically claims that she only cries in storms, seemingly so that she can mask her tears.', 'In “Fame Is a Gun,” Rae is already contending with superstardom and she illustrates how becoming more famous can feel unbridled and sometimes even violent. “Fame is a gun and I point it blind / Crash and burn, girl, baby, swallow it dry / You got a front row seat and I / I got a taste of the glamorous life.” As a pop star, Rae comes from a unique position. While some of her contemporaries, like Olivia Rodrigo, also found fame before they made the transition to music, Rae didn’t come from television or another platform where she may have found mentors to guide her. Her fame came from filming in her living room, and she’s had to learn how to navigate the public eye mostly on her own. “My life moves faster than me,” she sings in “Times Like These.” “Can’t feel the ground beneath my feet.” All throughout the record, Rae wants to enjoy her success, but a fear lingers in the background of what accomplishing her dreams could ultimately do to her life.', 'It was evident that Rae is a student of pop when she arrived to the 2024 VMAs in a bridal-inspired, underwear-baring ensemble from Miss Claire Sullivan that paid homage to her pop foremothers, Britney Spears and Madonna. On Addison, the singer hopes to join the ranks of all the greats who came before her, and her references are varied and fascinating. “Money Is Everything” directly calls these stars out by name. “And when I’m up dancing, please, DJ, play Madonna / Wanna roll one with Lana, get high with Gaga,” Rae proclaims. But she also makes references to more niche stars. In “Money,” Rae also has Natasha Bedingfield on her mind, with a reference to her “pocketful of sunshine.” Meanwhile, tracks like “In the Rain” and “Times Like These” sound as if they could’ve been recorded by early aughts stars like Hilary Duff or Ashlee Simpson. The juttering intro on “High Fashion” could’ve come straight from an FKA Twigs album, while “Diet Pepsi” is heavily Lana Del Rey-coded. Like ghosts guiding her forward, the presence of pop ancestors can be felt everywhere throughout the record.', 'Although she makes her many nods to pop divas, it’s clear that Rae has found something truly unique on Addison. Put on “Summer Forever” or “Headphones On” and you’ll find a sonic universe that makes you feel like you’re floating. You’ll find yourself hitting play over and over. Dreamy synths mingle with twinkly piano keys and stuttering beats glitch and fuzz before dissipating into the air. Addison may look to her pop forebears for inspiration, but she isn’t too concerned with following trends. Recently, some stars have been going down the country lane, while others are leaning into quiet indie pop. Here, the “Aquamarine” singer has formed a landscape all her own, and it will be interesting to see how she builds upon this with future music.', 'What makes Addison work is that you can tell our titular pop heroine is simply having fun. While she’s not afraid to touch on darker issues like family strife, body dysmorphia, and the pressures of fame, Addison keeps things relatively light. She just wants a cigarette and a good time. “You know, I actually don’t mind people experiencing me in a very honest and open way,” the singer told Zane Lowe in a recent Apple Music interview. “Really, any space as long as it is right here. I will allow anyone in my space.” That’s precisely why her songs, and their accompanying visuals, have stood out. Whether she’s donning neon pink wigs, rolling around in powdered sugar, or letting her background dancers throw her around like a rag doll, Addison isn’t afraid of being a little weird, and her work is all the better for it.

Addison Rae Builds an Irresistible Pop Fantasy in ‘Addison’ — One That’s Too Weird to Be Fake: Album Review,https://www.aol.com/addison-rae-builds-irresistible-pop-173000538.html,"['', '', 'Reinvention is an unusual concept to apply to someone at the beginning of their career. Transformation usually follows a clear introduction — a breakout role, a first book, a memorable performance. But in the case of Addison Rae, the idea of a “rebrand” defined her artistic breakthrough from the very beginning. Even as she earned credibility through co-signs and collaborations from shapeshifting tastemakers like Charli xcx and Arca, those endorsements only deepened the question: is this the product of a manufactured reinvention, or was this who she was all along?', 'To fully grasp the ethos of “Addison,” the 24-year-old TikTok sensation turned pop singer’s major label debut, you’d have to revisit the peaks and pitfalls of Addison Rae. As she became more of an influential figure on the viral dance and lip-syncing app, Rae worked to expand her presence in acting, music and business, even launching her own beauty line and starring in the Netflix film “He’s All That.” She released her debut single, “Obsessed,” produced by Benny Blanco, in 2021, though it was commercially unsuccessful.', 'More from Variety', ""Addison Rae on the All-Woman Team Behind Her Self-Titled Debut and Being Pop's Next 'It' Girl: 'This Is My Shot. I've Got to Go Big'"", ""Addison Rae Announces Release Date for Debut Album 'Addison'"", ""Addison Rae Releases 'Headphones On,' the Fourth Single Off Her Upcoming Debut Album"", 'Things were quiet for a while until a batch of Rae’s old demos began to gain traction online, with a niche group of alternative pop fans demanding an official release. Simply labeled “AR,” the four-song set arrived in 2023, and included what is now widely regarded as a standout single, “2 Die 4.” While some celebrated the simplicity of the song and its catchy verses — “My neck, 2 die 4 / My legs, 2 die 4 / This ah-ah sex, 2 die 4″ — others jumped to criticize her for it.', 'Over the last seven months, the singles for “Addison” arrived like clues, each more alluring than the last, filled with lush, sophisticated arrangements of glimmering, fuzzy pop melodies. “Diet Pepsi” and then “Aquamarine,” “High Fashion,” “Headphones On” and “Fame Is a Gun” all surpassed her previous work.', 'Rae flaunts an unadulterated freedom in her music that could easily be construed as juvenile or, well, weird. We got a clear taste of that in her feature on Charli’s “Von Dutch (Remix),” where at one point, she lets out a high-pitched scream that simmers. Though you could classify it as an unsettling disruption, the ad-lib became a trademark of the song. The same could be said here of the intro and outro of the trippy hip-hop breaks in “Money Is Everything,” which start somewhere sexy and slightly disorienting, and end in a state of ebullient bliss and borderline delusion.', 'In all of the promotion leading up to this release, Rae has made it a point that she and her collaborators approached the recording process without any direct influences in mind. Despite this, it’s hard not to draw comparisons to its most obvious touchstones, from Charli’s “Brat”-era tech house beats (see: “New York”) to Lana Del Rey’s melancholic refrains (“Summer Forever”) and the foundational aesthetics of Madonna and Britney Spears. But like most of her Gen-Z peers in pop, Rae is a student of the genre’s best and brightest; she wields relics of nostalgic imagery (at this point in time, that looks like wired headphones and a third generation iPod Nano) where they matter most, making references to her idols in a narrative that is still largely her own creation.', 'There is also no denying the lift of co-producers Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd — Rae’s only billed producers and co-writers on “Addison,” apart from Swedish songwriter Tove Burman, who has songwriting credits on “Lost and Found” and “High Fashion.” Kloser and Anderfjärd aren’t afraid to play with sound in unique ways, chopping spacey and rhythmic elements to complement Rae’s breathy vocals, like a carefully constructed puzzle.', 'After listening to the songs on “Addison” in their intended order, what becomes equally as intriguing are the lyrical themes, fueled by emotion and articulated in digestible one-liners and definitive affirmations: “I know the lows are what make the highs higher,” she sings in “Headphones On,” like something you’d underline in a wellness planner; “Life’s no fun through clear waters.” She finds comfort in her own systems of escapism, oftentimes leaving empowered by the moments she feels misunderstood or vulnerable.', 'Will this be enough to catapult Rae to the upper echelons of pop? Her determination alone demands consideration, even from those whose initial curiosities are fueled by skepticism. Either way, she’s managed to open the conversation — and that might be the most radical move of all.', 'Best of Variety', '25 Hollywood Legends Who Deserve an Honorary Oscar', 'New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week ', ""Emmy Predictions: Animated Program — Can Netflix Score Big With 'Arcane,' 'Devil May Cry' and the Final Season of 'Big Mouth?'"", ""Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Addison Rae – Addison,https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/addison-rae-addison/,"['In just one year, Addison Rae has invented herself. Once a ditzy TikTok star dancing for Jimmy Fallon and shaking hands with President Trump, she’s joined the it-girl posse of Charli xcx and Lorde, and gained new influences in Lana Del Rey, Madonna, and Björk. Her star-making string of single releases (along with their often artsy and self-serious videos) reintroduced her as an astute chronicler of pop, a fun girl who wears her influences on her sleeve and can make a damn good song while she’s at it. If you pretend to be esoteric long enough, that might just be who you are.', '‘Addison’, her long-awaited debut album, is helmed by Rae and her two producers Luka Kloser and ELVIRA, a crafty duo that create a rich roadmap of Rae’s many influences, which aren’t always in the same decade. ‘Addison’ feels uniquely fresh, even when tapping into trip-hop on ‘Headphones On’ or ‘Ray Of Light’-era Madonna trance on ‘Aquamarine’. And when they’re not imitating, they can put forth a pop song as sleek as ever, replete with small, clever moments like a Radiohead-like melody that starts ‘Times Like These’ or the stutter-stepping synths into the final chorus of ‘High Fashion’, which already sounds like one of the alien, icy beats FKA twigs or BANKS helmed in the mid-2010s.', 'It’s worth mentioning that ‘Addison’ shows all of its tricks too early — the pre-release singles stomp any and all album tracks, to the point where listening to the final record doesn’t feel like discovering something new, rather seeing more pockets of her persona. Could you imagine if ‘Headphones On’ was kept as a secret; the mesmerizing, string-based closer that reveals a depth to Rae in the record’s final moments? Fame is a gun, but it’s also a marathon, not a sprint.', 'For the most part, ‘Addison’ is a fun, delicious ride, soundtracking a movie where a small-town girl wins the lottery and parties it up in New York City. The sensual chorus on ‘Diet Pepsi’ will go down in history, as will the glowing, spoken-verse on ‘Aquamarine’: “Heart of the Ocean around my neck,” she gasps, drowning in luxury. The joy she feels on the trap-inflected ‘Money is Everything’ is palpable: “I’m the richest girl in the world!” she yells at the end, believable and bubbly. She dons a syrupy voice mixing early-aughts Kylie, Fergie and Britney on ‘Fame is a Gun’, singing “I got a taste of the glamorous life”; the repetition of “love New York / feel so free” on the ode to the city has an earnest, ‘aw, shucks!’ quality, like an excited puppy wagging its tail at any passerby. ', 'For all of the fun moments, ‘Addison’ can get quite melancholy. ‘Fame is a Gun’ dresses it up in a fun metaphor, and ‘In The Rain’ is an often-used solution to disguising tears, but there’s no hiding her sadness in the trippy ‘Times Like These’, where Rae repeats her confusion and asks, “Am I too young to be this mad? Am I too old to blame my dad?” It’s an affecting number about quick-moving fame, but she ends its chorus obliquely singing, “In times like these, it’s… it’s how it has to be,” which is like ending a strong speech and flubbing the final line. However, its detachment and acceptance fit well with her surrender (“It’s not my fate in the end”), which she echoes on ‘Headphones On’. ', 'At a brisk thirty minutes and a far-from-seamless build, ‘Addison’ reflects more what Rae enjoys rather than who she is. But who can blame a girl who, at her first opportunity, throws all of her influences in a blender to make a tapestry of what she grew up on? ‘Addison’ is a masterful pop album that comes from the heart, and there’s not many of those around right now.', '8/10', 'Words: Sam Franzini', '—', '—', '', 'Join us on WeAre8, as we get under the skin of global cultural happenings.

Addison Rae’s debut album proves her evolution from influencer to pop heavyweight is complete,https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/addison-rae-review-album-tracklist-features-tour-b2765142.html,"['', '', 'On her carefree debut, the US musician has gone mononymous and enlisted Swedish producers to help craft a Nineties and Y2K scrapbook that balances pop, past and present but never feels too try-hard', ""From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'In a recent New York Times interview, the American musician Addison Rae said she realised “how much choice and taste is kind of a luxury”. It’s a telling comment from someone who has built her debut album around carefully curated sonic references, but achieved fame by dancing to viral sounds on social media. You get the sense she’s finally getting to make her mark, the way she wants to. From 90s-era Madonna to the melancholy shades of Lana del Rey, Rae proves herself a devoted student of pop, while managing to shape an intimate, personal sound with its own hallmarks.', 'There will probably always be a degree of lingering snobbery around Rae. Having launched her career as a social media personality who’d dance to tracks that labels paid her $20 to promote, the Louisiana-born singer quickly became one of the platform’s biggest faces. Her 2023 debut EP, AR, made a stir in internet circles, but its ultra-slick, high-gloss brand of pop never quite converted the sceptics. For many, the leap from influencer to credible musician felt like a stretch.', 'Addison goes a long way toward changing that. The full-length is a nod to pop past and present, honouring these influences while not leaning too heavily on them. Even its high-saturation artwork is a homage to Y2K It girls including Hilary Duff and Christina Aguilera, with a pinch of grainy Tumblr aesthetics. When making her case for a record deal, Rae brought along a mood board with the words “intentional”, “intense”, “loud”, “dance” and “glitter” along with colours – aquamarine and hot pink. The theme of girlhood is ever-present on Addison, from referencing Sofia Coppola in her videos to lines like “Stayin’ up all night long / Singin’ our favourite songs” nodding to simple times of youth on “Summer Forever”.', 'When she announced the record on Instagram, Rae wrote that the music came from “a deep desperation and desire to understand myself better”. As well as moments of carefree popstar decadence, there’s introspection. “Headphones On” explores her parents’ divorce (“Wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love / Guess some things aren’t meant to last forever”) while “Fame is a Gun” addresses the rollercoaster of celebrity and the weight of expectation (“Crash and burn, girl, baby, swallow it dry”). The lyric “I got a taste of the glamorous life”, meanwhile, is a nod to Sheila E’s 1984 track “The Glamorous Life” – and perhaps also a dash of Fergie.', 'Throughout, Rae wears her references proudly on her sleeve. Her mentor Charli xcx has a clear influence on opener “New York”, with its “big apple” lyrics and glimmers of hyperpop. Rae’s breathy coo that opens “Money Is Everything” is pure Britney, even down to her studied pronunciation of the word “money”, and Rae is an admitted Spears superfan (see: the staged paparazzi shots of her reading Britney’s memoir in 2023). “Summer Forever” has glistening strokes of Enya’s new age synths, while the trip-hop track “Times Like These” recalls Madonna’s Ray Of Light.', 'The entire album is the product of Rae working exclusively with an all-female production crew: Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, who are signed to Max Martin’s publishing company. From the swinging synths on “High Fashion” to the nu-disco pulse of “New York”, the production blends commercial pop tropes with some of the weirdness that has historically been key in making chart cuts stand the test of time. At times, you wish they’d push that weirdness further – Rae’s sweeping, dreamy sonics are cohesive, but the album could benefit from more moments of contrast.', 'Alongside Addison’s rollout, Rae has demonstrated a consistent ability to position herself as an attention-grabbing artist, whether through spinning through clouds of white powder in the video to “High Fashion” or posing in front of a sign for the uninspiring supermarket chain Iceland to promote “Headphones On”. All this goes to show, as Charli xcx’s Brat did recently, that marketing and the culture surrounding a record can be as crucial as the music itself.', 'Addison Rae may have started out as an internet personality, but Addison earns her a seat at the pop table. Rather than a work of fluke or novelty, it marks the arrival of an artist who knows exactly what she’s doing.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Even before her debut album Addison dropped today, the 24-year-old had already managed to become the sixth-most followed account on TikTok, star in Netflix original series He’s All That, create a hit podcast, model for Saint Laurent and Praying, feature in perhaps the most iconic remix album of all time, and even secure the top spot on Dazed’s best tracks of 2024.', 'What is certain about Addison Rae, however, is that she is now cemented as one of the world’s most exciting new pop stars. In less than a year since the synth-pop, bad b summer anthem “Diet Pepsi” appeared on charts globally, Rae has attracted comparisons to Britney Spears and the dreamy alt-pop stylings of Lana Del Rey, while the latest project takes cues from 1998 album Ray of Light by the Queen of Pop herself: Madonna. It’s a pop girl pastiche that Rae herself acknowledges on the album’s fourth track “Money is Everything”, singing: “DJ play Madonna, Wanna roll one with Lana, Get high with Gaga.”', 'Speaking in advance of Addison’s release, album collaborators Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd explained that the “sonic lynchpin” of the project is the Korg M1 synthesiser, which was a staple of Madonna’s house-pop crossovers in the 90s. On tracks like “Lost & Found” and “In the Rain”, this artistic direction adds a much-needed bite to Rae’s otherwise straightforward youthful hedonism, blending in with Rae’s layered, reverb-drenched vocals to create the dream-pop soundscape that forms Addison’s central appeal. ', 'But the new project isn’t just sunshine and beaches. As Addison reaches penultimate interlude track “Life’s No Fun Through Clear Waters”, the viral star has gone from partying through the “Summer Forever” to crying “In The Rain” and lamenting “Times Like These”. It’s a pretty standard coming-of-age story, featuring Rae ruminating on whether to dye her hair and if her body image has been corrupted by fame. But, with lyrics like “When it comes to shoes I’ll be your slut” and “I’m gonna go down in history, don’t ask too many questions”, it’s delivered with a disarming transparency that makes Rae somewhat of a relatable superstar. While not reinventing the wheel, Addison certainly cements Rae’s position as the 21st century’s brightest new pop star.', 'Below, to celebrate the release of Addison Rae’s Addison, the Dazed team selects their top ten tracks from the album (number one being the very best). ', 'I like this song, but I’m just too broke and embittered to truly enjoy listening to a millionaire sing about being rich, even if they’re doing so ironically or in the service of some vague social critique – it’s a bop though! (JG)', 'I find it hard to write about Addison Rae’s music without googling synonyms for “sultry” – but what else can I say? She’s a sultry artist, and “High Fashion” is a sultry song, or perhaps a voluptuous, sensual, alluring and luscious one. I really like it musically, but the lyrics are maybe too AI-generated TikTok coquette for my tastes – they’d lend themselves easily to an Effy Stonem fan-cam. (JG)', 'It was raining when I listened to this for the first time, and it made me sad that I wasn’t taking a wistful stroll along a Sicilian shoreline with a man named Lorenzo. The production is pleasantly languid and the lyrics, while a little obvious in parts ( “making out in the car, doing shots at the bar”, etc) capture the sense of expansive possibility which the best summers have – anything could happen baby! This is a solid album track, but after a few listens, it hasn’t blown me away like some of the others. (JG)', '', 'This song, to me, is a ‘maladaptive daydreaming on a long walk’ anthem. Honestly, she’s right, put your headphones on, listen to a good song, and just get over it. That chorus (guess I got to accept the pain, need a cigarette to make me feel better / every good thing comes my way) is a bit earnest, a bit 00s, a bit cheesy pop – but it works! Let it be and let go! (HD)', 'With each new single that she dropped in the run-up to her album release, a new pop banger was born. Somehow, Addison Rae managed to score a perfect five out of five for her single rollout and “Fame Is A Gun” was no exception. Rumour has it, the lyrics are a reference to Sheila E’s 1984 track “The Glamorous Life”, which was written by Prince (and what better way to secure banger status than with a little Prince magic?). (IVD)', 'This is crawling up the ranking every time I play it. Although it’s one of the most sonically original songs on the album – those propulsive, shimmering synths, combined with Rae’s breathy vocals, feel almost euphorically extraterrestrial – it still features some knowing winks to her pop icon foremothers (“I strike a pose”, “If you’re offended, say a prayer”). Say what you want about Rae’s love of pastiche, but she at least has immaculate taste. “In The Rain” sweeps you away, like all the best pop songs should. (DS)', 'This is one of our favourites of the previously unreleased material – it’s so dreamy and sultry and gently euphoric. This is probably the song which sounds most inspired by 90s Madonna, along with a touch of All Saints and that kind of Balearic The Beach soundtrack atmosphere. But while it wears its influences on its sleeve, it’s not overpowered by them – she’s forging a distinctive sound, and it still sounds like an Addison Rae song. (JG)', '“Diet Pepsi” came out right after my ex and I broke up, and without exaggeration, I listened to it on repeat for three days straight, dreaming about a deranged rebound and re-losing my own innocence in the back seat. “Diet Pepsi” is pop music at its best: giddy, effervescent and exhilarating (the key change at the end is hands down one of this year’s most euphoric musical moments.) (JG)', 'Following the previously released singles, I had high expectations pressing play on this album. But honestly, I was not expecting to open with a song like “New York”. Don’t cancel me, but having a real love for NYC can actually feel like a religious experience, and this song encapsulates that feeling of arriving in the best city on earth, full of life and hope. Granted, most people are likely not arriving at the Bowery Hotel, but she still makes good points. Also, that pounding drumbeat… sensational. 10/10, no notes. (HD)', 'While I loved “Diet Pepsi”,  it wasn’t until the release of “Aquamarine” that I became properly excited about Addison’s new direction, that I thought “this chica has got the juice…”. While obviously inspired by Ray of Light and 90s eurodance, it doesn’t just feel like an exercise in nostalgia – the production is fresh and interesting, the melody is gorgeous, and Addison’s vocals are as exactly as restrained as they need to be (“sultry”, you might even say!) “Aquamarine” is a classic in the making, and the song which cemented her status as a major new pop talent. (JG)']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df
Addison Rae’s ‘Addison’ Album: All 12 Tracks Ranked,https://www.billboard.com/lists/addison-rae-album-review-songs-ranked/,"['With her anticipated self-titled debut album, Addison Rae solidifies her pop star status.', 'Addison Rae’s rise to main pop girl is equal parts master class and modern spectacle. Having started on TikTok, becoming one of the platform’s top users known for choreographing brief dances to catchy hits, Rae always had her sights set on a bigger stage — literally.', 'In the past year, she’s performed onstage with Charli xcx and Troye Sivan at the New York stop of their Sweat Tour, and at Coachella this past April, Rae performed again with Charli but also Arca, who remixed Rae’s “Aquamarine” into a track titled “Arcamarine” months prior. During the live performance, Rae unveiled her debut album’s release date, writing “June 6” on her underwear.', 'Now – nearly one year after the release of her hit single “Diet Pepsi” — June 6 has come and the moment is Rae’s alone to bask in. Across her debut album’s 12 tracks, there are two interludes and zero features; all songs were co-written by Rae, alongside collaborators Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd.', 'And while for many this moment has felt like a long time coming for the fast-rising, always captivating pop artist, it may just as soon come to an end; as Rae’s website states under each available item (including a CD, black, light blue and tangerine vinyl and a sold-out box set) Addison is “the first and last album by Addison Rae.”', 'If the album is a one-and-done, it’s immediately iconic. An accomplishment surrounded by whispers of “she did that.” Or, it could be nothing more than an indication that the Addison Rae the Internet has come to know is simply shifting before our eyes. Rae even said in her ELLE cover story that she’s going by “just Addison now.”', 'Whatever comes next for the artist, she can always look back on Addison as a project that is entirely her — and perhaps far more honest and vulnerable than even she anticipated to be. As a result, Rae’s debut proves her to be one of one among pop’s current crew. So whether or not there’s more to come, just put your “Headphones On” and hit repeat – and read below for Billboard’s ranking of all 12 tracks.', 'The opening notes on Addison’s first interlude are distinctly similar to those of “Aquamarine,” the track directly before it, only the sun-kissed, effervescent energy of the latter is replaced by moody, languid synths. Rae’s repeated sentiment of “I lost myself and found myself again” echoes off the walls of the production, soon giving way to her booming, layered chanting. The interlude proves that the pop star is unafraid to get introspective — even if only for a brief moment.', '“Life’s no fun through clear waters,” a siren-like voice echoes and repeats over a string section, (plucking a lyric straight from “Headphones On”). Though it arrives as the second-to-last track on the album, it serves as a reminder of the project’s entire motto: this should be fun. Isn’t that the point? Addison acts as one big reminder that the plot isn’t perfection — because how boring would that be?', 'It feels like a given to include a track called “Summer Forever” on an album arriving at the top of June, just weeks before the official first day of the season. Rae’s breezy vocals and the song’s minimal yet immersive production are perfect companions for sheer drapes billowing in the wind on a balcony door left open — a clear indicator of a summer day well spent. (Plus, if pitched down, this could just as easily be a song by Lana Del Rey, queen of summertime sadness.)', '“Have you ever dreamt of being seen?/ Not by someone, more like in a magazine,” Rae asks to open the album’s third single, “High Fashion.” She’s seemingly intent on doing whatever it takes to pull off a look worthy enough, rejecting passing thrills — drugs and cheap love — in its pursuit. It’s not her most complicated song on the album, but who says a pop hit can’t hang its hat on thumping bass and a deep love for couture? Not Addison Rae, that’s for damn sure.', 'One of the more subdued, airy songs on the album (alongside “Summer Forever” and “Times Like These”), “In the Rain” offers a glimpse into the Addison behind the layers of tulle on her album cover. “Young dumb and cute nothing to lose/ And now the past is someone that I have to answer for/I got a whole new point of view,” she sings at the top of the track, before concluding: “Misunderstood but I’m not gonna sweat it.” While the writing stands out as some of Rae’s most vulnerable, the song is tucked in between similar-sounding “Summer Forever” and the higher-energy “Fame Is A Gun” — a smart move for a song about being inconspicuous.', '“Times Like These” is like the angrier, somehow more honest sister to “In the Rain” — not evidenced at all by how it sounds, but solely by what Rae says. It’s almost as if crying in the rain (see: “In the Rain”) didn’t solve anything (shocking) and a few songs later Rae couldn’t help but revisit the same wounds. “Am I too young to be this mad/ Am I too old to blame my dad,” she wonders aloud. Consider this song a warning, as it’s Rae’s most tender tracks that hit hardest.', 'Perhaps more so than anywhere else on Addison, “Money Is Everything” calls back on what made 2023 EP AR such a cult classic among her core fan base: pure, unadulterated bubblegum-pop fun. She’s drawing comparisons to Marilyn Monroe — referring to the late icon by her birth name, of course — requesting Madonna at the DJ booth and fantasizing about a perfect night out with the pop girlies, all on top of a bouncy beat that’s as sweet as candy. And of all the quotable one-liners from Rae on the album, of which they run aplenty, her outro shriek of “Money loves me!” just may take the cake.', 'The hustle and bustle of New York City isn’t for everyone, but those who get it, well, they just get it. On Addison’s opener, Rae adds to the canon of love letters to the Big Apple with a track primed for the dance floor. She’s moving at a pace to make any tried-and-true New Yorker proud, hardly stopping to drop her bags off at the Bowery Hotel before heading straight to the club. It’s an apropos tone-setter for the rest of the album: Don’t get too comfortable and don’t get too complacent because much like the city itself, she’s always going to keep you on your toes.', 'When “Aquamarine” arrived, it felt almost obvious that this is what an Addison Rae album would sound like: glittering, confident and dance-floor ready. But now, when heard in the context of the album itself, a song like “Aquamarine” is actually an outlier. “I’m not hiding, anymore,” sings Rae. “I’m free.” And while it’s not the only time Rae sings of feeling free on Addison, (she does so on “New York” as well), it is far from the theme of the album; much of Addison is about a time when she felt quite the opposite, but made the best of it anyway on her road to liberation.', 'It’s deeply admirable how consistent Rae is about her proclivity toward fame throughout the entire album. “Nothing makes me feel as good as being loved by you,” she sings in one of her most honest moments during a brief lull in the track’s pace. She lets the spotlight steer her (“Tell me who I am”); implores it for its lustrous shine (“When you shame me, it makes me want it more”); and eliminates any doubt about her right to exist within it (“There’s no mystery/I’m gonna make it, gonna go down in history”). If all the world’s a stage, Rae is stopping nothing short of standing front and center.', 'Ending her debut album with the already-released and widely loved “Headphones On” is pure brilliance. As the song and music video make clear, “Headphones On” is an ode to music as an escape — arguably one of the most relatable sentiments of all. Closing Addison — an album that is so subtly steeped in various traumas — with a song about accepting the pain proves that Rae is not only an artist with a vision, but an artist who is more self aware than she gets credit for. “Headphones On” even has self-referential lines like “life’s no fun through clear waters,” a sentence that gets its own interlude, or “soaking up the rain,” a nod to “In the Rain” — and it all points to the same thing. Addison Rae knows exactly what she’s doing. She’s been listening carefully, and now, it’s the listener’s turn to do the same.', 'Nine months later and “Diet Pepsi” is still just as refreshing as ever. From the very beginning, it has always felt like the kind of song that demonstrates how well Rae has her finger on the pulse of pop today. It showcases her ability to craft a punchy hook ready to wrap around your brain (and your heart) for days on end. It winks at the listener just enough to know Rae is in on the bit, but not so self-indulgent that it feels corny or warrants an eye roll. It proves she is clearly capable of crafting a radio-ready earworm, but the rest of Addison proves the nuance in her artistry, even if fans would happily take a dozen mainstream fastballs. With “Diet Pepsi” bubbling back to the forefront thanks to the arrival of Addison, don’t expect it to fizzle any time soon.', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Rebirth, rebrand, reintroduction—whatever you call it—the Louisiana-born TikTok dancer transformed into one of the most promising pop acts of the current age with the release of “Diet Pepsi” last summer. Since then, skeptics and day 1 superfans have tuned in to watch her every move, whether it’s because of the push-and-pull of her sexy girl next door persona or her slinky hooks and booming production from her collaborators, Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd.', 'So, when I got word that Addison and Spotify were hosting a rare live show on the eve of her album release, I knew I had to be there. Especially because it would technically be her first official live performance of tracks from her self-titled debut album.', 'She took center stage at New York’s famously sleazy and glamorous nightclub, The Box, which acted as her playground for the night. The room was filled to the brim with magazine editors, late-night producers, and devoted fans who waited hours for a glimpse of the star. Bushwick’s elite even crossed the bridge to Manhattan to capture the newly minted pop princess in all her glory. As aerial artists and dancers donned lingerie underneath burning disco balls, I brushed shoulders with Addison’s star-studded stan list, from Julia Fox, Richie Shazam, and Amelia Gray to Conan Gray, Lola Tung, and Clairo.', 'The intimate inauguration marked a new beginning for Addison. As she opened her set with “Fame Is a Gun” in a kitschy satin bed, bated breaths escaped the lips of attendees who couldn’t take their eyes off her.', 'The mic was on, and soon enough, she treated fans with her original cabaret-inspired “musical theater” rendition of “High Fashion.” Her it girl-in-crime, Lexee Smith, served a campy, melodramatic poetry reading in Louboutins in between one of her outfit changes as a makeshift interlude until Addison returned for a particularly transcendental moment.', 'When the opening notes of “Aquamarine” trickled through The Box’s theater, not one word was missed by fans. I even overheard a friend over my shoulder say, “This song is so gay.” (Complimentary. Not in the way that would prompt Hilary Duff to pull her allyship card.)', 'As Addison hit her marks in a flowy bright blue mini dress, we not only found catharsis on the dance floor—she did, too.', 'In 2021, I covered the early days of Addison’s crossover from TikTok to real-world fame at Seventeen, and I’ll admit it: I was always intrigued by her essence, but I wasn’t totally sold on “Obsessed” once it dropped.', 'It wasn’t until one of my best friends dragged me to our living room to catch her performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that I locked in and saw her for what she truly was: a small-town girl aching for the life of a big-city star. Let it be known that this was the moment she unlocked her potential as a Main Pop Girl in my eyes. From then on, I fully understood her vision. When most of her catalogue leaked in 2022, I clicked play for research purposes and fully became hooked by the following summer.', 'Before her 7-track performance last night, she teased what could come from the Addison Rae live experience, making cameos with her close friends and collaborators on multiple occasions. There was the “Von Dutch” remix at Charli XCX’s pre-brat Boiler Room set in Brooklyn and their post-brat performance on Coachella’s main stage, her “Arcamarine” stint during Arca’s more intimate set in the desert, and, of course, “Diet Pepsi” with Charli and Troye Sivan’s Sweat tour stop at Madison Square Garden. These moments inched us closer to the glittery dance pop world of Addison, yet we didn’t see the star fully in her element. Until now.', 'She’s no stranger to a Britney Spears comparison—in fact, she seems to fully welcome it, knowing they’re both hometown heroes in Louisiana—but she pays homage to her heroes. In interviews, she’s openly named Britney, Madonna, Prince, and Michael Jackson as influences. On her tongue-in-cheek satirical number, “Money Is Everything,” she wistfully sings about her dream blunt rotation with Lana Del Rey and Lady Gaga after name-dropping Norma Jean. It’s abundantly clear she’s at the top of her class as a pop culture student, and she’s well on her way to becoming a teacher.', 'She no longer has to dream of being seen, because all eyes are on her...and they’ll stay there.', 'STREAM ‘ADDISON’ ON SPOTIFY', 'J.Lo Makes Her Return to Vegas With New Residency', 'Miley’s “Traumatic” Health Scare Mid-Performance', 'PSA: Billie Eilish Just Extended Her Tour', 'Shakira Reunites With Alejandro Sanz & Wyclef Jean', 'MUNA’s Katie Gavin Has a Digital Camera + a Dream', 'Buy Lorde Tickets Before They Inevitably Sell Out', 'Beyoncé Made $$$ From ‘Cowboy Carter’ Tour', 'All About Meghan Trainor’s Lyric Swap...', 'Katy Clapped Back at “Thinking of You” TikToks', 'Excuse Me, It’s Time to Snag Benson Boone Tickets', 'Time to Cure Your FOMO and Buy Beyoncé Tickets', 'All the Celebs at Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter’ Tour', 'A Part of Hearst Digital Media', 'We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.', '©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

It was always me trying to provoke a feeling from a song or from music. I’m a very sensual and sexual person. I’m very intimate with myself and my body, and everything kind of reflects that. Everything feels very personal.”', 'Addison also shared that having her debut album - which, in true Addison style, she announced the release date for on her underwear at Coachella - produced entirely by women was “really special”.', 'The singer said working with Luka Kloser and Elvira on the record was “beautiful and magical”.', 'She explained: “I have something really special with these girls. It feels really beautiful and magical that it is just all females. I never set out for it to be that way, I think because it’s not very common and you almost don’t get that opportunity very much to work with just females in a room.”', 'While she has been labelled the latest “It girl” in pop, Addison admitted she is wary of the praise.', 'She said: “It is obviously very complimentary. What does that even mean, really, to be the pop girl? Let’s see if the songs get more popular, then they can call me a pop girl. This is my shot. I’ve got to go big.”', 'Meanwhile, Addison - who dropped her debut single Obsessed in 2023 - has spoken about how TikTok was the perfect launchpad for her career.', 'She told Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1: ""I think in the beginning, especially, and starting out, I always knew that I wanted to make music. I always knew I wanted to act. I think I just knew I wanted to perform. That was just something that was really obvious to me since I was a little girl.', '""When TikTok happened, I was almost like, well, this seems like a really nice way to get myself to Los Angeles first, because I think in Louisiana there wasn\'t as many opportunities or like possibility, really, to pursue that profession necessarily, unless you just got really, really lucky.""', ""Addison gained popularity with her dance videos on TikTok in 2019, and by March 2020, rapper The Kid Laroi caused a buzz when he released a song titled Addison Rae, before she made her film debut in 2021's He's All That and released 'Obsessed' two years later.""]",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df
Addison is an intriguing yet effective comeback from Addison Rae,https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/albums/addison-rae-addison-effective-comeback,"['We may have witnessed one of this decade’s most satisfying rebrands yet.', '“Obsessed” is merely a distant memory. The current Addison loves it still, but said she’s found her integrative musical ground, that is, the 90s and 00s dance-pop scenes. You’ll hear Mandy Moore’s self-titled on “Times Like These”; Britney Spears’s Blackout on “Fame Is a Gun”; Madonna’s Bedtime Stories on “Headphones On” or Ray of Light on “Aquamarine” and “Times Like These”. It fits her spectacularly well, hence a flop-exempt return. FKA twigs’s EUSEXUA might be this record’s big sister for how similar their reference points are, yet there’s virtue in each and one’s own concoction of them. Unlike twigs’s work, Addison wallows in the art of pastiche – recalling Todd Haynes’s referential queer films à la Far From Heaven and Carol, whose everything apart from the screenplay mimics Douglas Sirk’s melodrama – and minds about originality at stripped minimum.', 'While Haynes meticulously conjures the era’s angelic, sublime atmosphere to underline and critique the historical erasure of gay and lesbian romance during the Lavender Haze’s high tides, Rae and her creative team do so for the “vibes”. ELVIRA and Luka Kloser, to their credit, did a nearly flawless job at imitating the canons’ stylistic intimacies. “In the Rain” features the snappy synths and sophisticated drums of Madonna’s “Frozen” that tie well with Rae’s sexy under-breath voice. “Diet Pepsi” cherishes a scrumptious key change hardly present in today’s mainstream music, casting shafts of nostalgic light that turn Lana Del Rey’s early risqué allure into a lost 00s pop hit. Indeed, everything here sounds wonderful and emits an out-of-time quality so few have succeeded in attaining. But what else?', 'Of course, it’s enough to excel in recalibrating tunes from a bygone era. Addison’s imperfections, however, are too blunt to be ignorable. “Life’s No Fun Through Clear Waters” takes one great line from the closing track and abuses it in a tiresome refrain that ends too abruptly to stir up any visible emotion; even the Björkesque symphony, making such a forceful entrance at first, shrivels upon Rae’s confused tracklisting. Another interlude “Lost & Found” crushes the tantalizing momentum set by “Aquamarine”, which, literally, is also about self-reinvention. It would’ve worked if both had been given breadth and width to grow into fully fledged songs, exploring novel ideas that would contextualize the proceeding songs’ moodier headspaces. They appear now more as fillers than substantial contributions to the album’s already lacklustre narrative.', 'Why does “High Fashion”’s bassline sound so intoxicating and disjointed? Why does “Headphones On” possess trip-hop stems that are strangely symbolic of the destructive gallows? These interludes, if executed better, might’ve fulfilled and encouraged the listeners’ curiosity such as mine over Rae’s intriguing soundscapes. In simple words: there should be more than plain “vibes” to evade shallowness and heighten singularity. Rae, ELVIRA and Kloser have undeniably great taste in canonical pop music, so how should its multi-facets present Rae’s life as an influencer born in the age of TikTok? She has admitted that it’s self-titled to embody her true self. Yet in the recent Apple Music podcast, Rae has proved to have ruminations and thoughtful comments on various subjects that exceed beyond just sexiness, lust and mundane heartbreaks. Where are those on here?', 'Take Addison’s closest references: Madonna’s Ray of Light and Britney Spears’s Breakout. They, too, have songs about love, fame and sex – although with the off-center additions of Himalayan yoga classes (“Shanti/Ashtangi”) that enraptured Madonna so much she once did it in a plane aisle, or peep shows (“Freakshow”) that gave Spears one of her career’s most riveting performances and showcased her heartshaped views on fractured everyday life. Addison has little of such specificity and eccentricity, opting instead for overused catch phrases like “summer forever” and “I love New York”. Her lyricism claws at a directness that borders on forgettability, if not except for some outliers as on Addison highlight “High Fashion”, where its opening verse lays bare her crude yearning for societal acceptance via fame, possibly winking at a deeper, more deprecating dissatisfaction with oneself.', 'Rae has much to improve upon, which isn’t necessarily an unfavourable predicament. She still hasn’t performed any song on her own; as of now, we have insufficent evidence to gauge her stage presence that will testify her capabilities as a well-equipped pop star with a formidable voice. She has few novelties to offer lyrically and sonically in this decade’s musical landscape. But one thing that deserves outright acclaim is her creative team’s idiosyncratic visual representations of the record. How long has it been since we got a series of music videos this good, this campy, this slay-the-house-down-boots? Albeit directed by a man, “Aquamarine”’s video art is surreptitiously feminine and queer in its abrupt cutting and garish colors, a perfect fit for the song itself. Could this, then, be how she wants to be remembered – as a singles and visual star who knows how to make a comeback, exhort hype, deliver a memorable era, and not much else?', 'Get the Best Fit take on the week in music direct to your inbox every Friday']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Following this success, she released several more singles, including “Aquamarine,” “High Fashion” and “Headphones On,” each showcasing her evolving sound and artistic vision.', 'The new album is packed with a variety of sounds, showcasing her versatility as an artist.

Her dancers then ripped off the silk sheets to reveal Rae restrained by her arms and her legs while wearing burlesque-style lingerie.', '“I have a question for you,” she told the crowd. “Have you ever dreamt of being seen?” she sang as she segued into her second song of the night with an old Hollywood burlesque version of her recent single “High Fashion.” This sultry performance, with Rae wearing lingerie and heels, took fans back to the 1940s — think sparkles, glitter, heels and dancing while singing into a retro-style mic.', 'Addison made a quick change into a blue dress that complemented the song’s mood, while her best friend Lexi read sultry, dark poetry as multiple mirrors were set up to surround the stage. She performed “Aquamarine” surrounded by these mirrors, allowing fans to catch striking glimpses of her reflections as she sang. The performance was rich in imagery and high energy, perfectly mirroring the crowd’s excitement for the track.', '“This next song is kind of the one that started it all. If you know it, sing along,” Rae told the crowd as she stepped on stage in jean shorts, a white crop top, heels and a white feather boa. She launched into “Diet Pepsi,” a track that has become a favorite among fans. The crowd erupted, singing along word for word, making it the most electric moment of the night.', 'As fans chanted for an encore, Rae playfully popped her leg out from behind the closed curtains and asked, “Would you be mad at us if we did one more song?” She returned to the stage with “Times Like These,” one of her most tender and emotional tracks, an ideal choice to close the night and leave fans in a reflective mood. Raising a glass at the end of the song, she and her dancers shared a celebratory toast, thanking the crowd for being part of the special moment and celebrating her debut album.', 'Best of Billboard', ""Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were 'Hangin' Tough' at No. 1"", ""Janet Jackson's Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits"", ""H.E.R. & Chris Brown 'Come Through' to No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay Chart"", ""Sign up for Billboard's Newsletter.

Addison Rae: Addison review – 2025’s most refreshing star revels in pop’s shallow pleasures,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/06/addison-rae-addison-album-review,"['(Columbia)\nThe one-time TikTok dancer’s remarkably cohesive debut spans Jersey club to R&B, and defies an obsession with ‘lore’ to suggest that the best pop isn’t that deep', 'W\nhen Madonna came to the height of her powers in the late 90s and early 00s, it felt as though she had perfected a new mode of pop stardom, making icy, complex and uncannily incisive records such as Ray of Light and Confessions on a Dance Floor. Those albums are powered by a gripping interplay between detachment and intensity; they sound, to me, like attempts to make pop albums without any sense of ego. As if she’s saying: this isn’t a Madonna record, it’s a pop record.', 'Addison Rae’s exceptional debut album reminds me of that unimpeachable run of Madonna records, understanding that supreme confidence and exceptional taste can sell even the most unusual album. It’s both familiar – Rae is an artist who unapologetically lives and dies by her references – and totally bold: I get the sense that she is less trying to say “this is who I am” as much as “this is what pop should be”.', 'Rae’s vision of pop is formally traditionalist – she loves big choruses, euphoric key changes, huge builds – but undeniably influenced by her past life as an inhabitant of content-creation HQ Hype House, after her dance videos made her one of the most-followed people on TikTok. The 24-year-old sees no cognitive dissonance in putting together seemingly mismatched aesthetic or emotional sensibilities, a quality that, to me, suggests supreme comfort with the practically dadaist experience of scrolling TikTok’s For You page. Winsome opener New York explores frenetic Jersey club; on Headphones On, a warm-and-fuzzy 90s-style R&B track, she casually tosses off the lyric “wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love” as if it was an intrusive thought she just had to let out.', 'Although Addison covers a lot of ground musically, every song also sounds uncannily like it came out of the indie-electronica boom of the early 2010s; High Fashion, arguably the best song here, is a pitch-perfect throwback to early James Blake and second-album Mount Kimbie; Diet Pepsi is Lana Del Rey by way of Neon Indian. The record’s remarkable coherence can be chalked up to the fact that Rae worked with the same writer-producer duo, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, on every song – a rare feat for a major-label pop debut, made rarer by the fact that big-budget pop records made exclusively by women are practically nonexistent. But a quick scan of Anderfjärd and Kloser’s credits suggests that Rae is in the driver’s seat here; neither of them has ever made a song as laconically pretty as the EDM-scented Summer Forever, or as girlishly menacing as Fame Is a Gun.', 'If Addison has a mission statement, it’s on the latter: “Tell me who I am – do I provoke you with my tone of innocence?” she asks at its outset. “Don’t ask too many questions, that is my one suggestion.” It’s an invitation to take Rae’s music at face value – there’s no self-conscious dip into wilful silliness or laborious camp. Most of the time, Rae is stringing together vague abstractions in a way that shuns overinterpretation, like when she sings: “No matter what I try to do / In times like these, it’s how it has to be”, or returns to the phrase “Life’s no fun through clear waters”.', 'Addison arrives at a fortuitous time: Rae resists the 2020s impulse to intellectualise every pop album and is unencumbered by ham-fisted concepts, Easter eggs or ultra-prescriptive “lore” that tells listeners what to think. Its casually incisive tone suggests Rae might be a great pop flâneuse in the vein of Madonna or Janet Jackson, drifting through the scene with alluring ease and a gimlet eye. But she’d probably tell me I’m overthinking it.', 'Thanks for reading 26 articles.

The simple answer is because she’s Addison Rae and that’s what she does.', 'For years, Rae amassed TikTok followers (88 million of them) with her cute dance routines, delivered with a beaming smile and an All-American tan. Even if you weren’t on TikTok, you might’ve recognised her from teaching Kourtney how to dance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Maybe you even heard The Kid Laroi’s early tribute song in her honour.', 'The TikTok-to-talent pipeline has been fraught for many a social media star, but Rae cracked its code when she segued to music. In 2023, her EP AR bubbled to cult status after Charli XCX cosigned on the slinky 2 Die 4, and then Rae’s piercing wail on Charli XCX’s Von Dutch Remix became a defining sound of Brat Summer. Further cameos onstage alongside Charli XCX and Troye Sivan gave Rae clout and music’s snobbier set permission to pay attention.', 'Rae then went on a tear with a remarkable string of singles, all of which feature on her debut album Addison, including Diet Pepsi, where she eased into the gloomy romanticism of Lana Del Rey; Aquamarine, which evoked the deep house grooves of Ray of Light-era Madonna and Impossible Princess-era Kylie; and High Fashion, a perfectly demented pop song built on wompy synths, a drugged-out click, and Rae’s lusty falsetto.', 'Better yet have been their matching music videos, where Rae – in her element – projects decadent glamour. She rolls around in couture; she chain-smokes cigarettes like a French person; she uses her body louchely when she dances, mostly in Louboutins, a wink to pop excess. (Proving the extent to which the taste-making establishment have sought her association, Rae’s creative team now regularly includes indie director Sean Price Williams, choreographer Danielle Polanco, and Interview Magazine’s Mel Ottenberg on creative design.)', 'By this point, the album’s already an afterthought. That it aims to be a statement, in the old school kinda way, is appreciated. Entirely overseen by Swedish producers Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd, the songs on Addison emit a hazy, twilight, cosmopolitan cool. They smell like petrichor and oud.', 'The album cuts not already released add to Rae’s narrative. Opener New York is upbeat hyperpop charting Rae’s arrival to big-city liberation, built around the evocative couplet “chew gum, kick drum”, a sort of Pink Pony Club for trashbags. The fabulously bratty Money is Everything finds Rae aligning herself with Marilyn Monroe over a bellowing trap beat and sing-songy kids’ chant, her mischievous energy turned infectious.', 'To obsessives, there’s been a playful sense of destiny in Rae’s arrival to pop stardom: she was born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, barely two hours (and two decades) from Kentwood, the hometown of Britney Spears. Some foresee the second coming, but the goodwill’s not been unanimous.', 'Look under any of her videos and you’ll find a comment like “This rebrand should be studied in schools” – the implication being that, while successful, Rae’s evolution from online personality to pop artist has felt manufactured or inauthentic. (The idea that, god forbid, someone might develop better taste and influences later into their 20s and 30s, is inconceivable to this generation.)', 'Addicted to Addy: pop’s new superstar.', 'In interviews, Rae’s palmed off her former girl-next-door persona on TikTok as marketing savvy. “Taste is a privilege,” she told the New York Times, suggesting she’d been actively maximising her algorithmic fame to better position herself to eventually manoeuvre beyond the app. But it lends a defensiveness to Addison that, if necessary on her debut, feels antithetical to Rae’s personal world-building.', 'On Money is Everything, she screams her holy trinity as evidence of her pop bona fides: “DJ, play Madonna, wanna roll one with Lana, get high with Gaga, and the girl I used to be is still the girl inside of me!” . On In the Rain, over a sweet acid house beat that could’ve come from Saint Etienne’s Foxbase Alpha, she laments that she’s “misunderstood but I’m not gonna sweat it, isn’t it all for the show?” On Diet Pepsi, Addison’s first single, she was seductively suggesting she’s “losing all my innocence” at, c’mon, 24?', 'For some reason, it all reminds me of Camila Cabello, whose last album, C, XOXO, was its own attempt at a grungy reinvention. Pop fans rejected Cabello’s pivot, but there’s something in Addison’s nostalgic touchstones – the Alanis yodels, the Janet adlibs, the ’90s aesthetics – that might be more palatable to most than Cabello’s adventurous tilt towards hyperpop and SoundCloud rap. Maybe what I’m saying is Camila Cabello walked so Addison Rae could run.', 'And run she has, all the way from TikTok to pop’s ruling class.

Hedonism has a new hero.', 'For those who\'ve watched her rise, it\'s almost impossible to believe. It wasn\'t so long ago – almost exactly a year into the COVID-19 pandemic – that a young Rae went on ""The Tonight Show"" and taught its host Jimmy Fallon a few stiff, meme-able TikTok dance moves, then what made up the bulk of her career. It was met with almost immediate backlash, as is common for young women with viral posts. But she wielded it like a weapon: Social media celebrity begat acting roles for Rae, then a coveted collaboration with Charli XCX in the form of a ""Von Dutch"" remix, and now, at age 24, her final form: becoming the hyper-ambitious, hyper-femme pop star for the current moment.', 'As a full body of work, ""Addison"" taps into the genre-agnostic zeitgeist, where pop music appears edgy and elastic. The songs speak for themselves, from the pitch-shifted trip-hop ""Headphones On"" and the snapped percussion, minor chords, NSFW lyrics and vanishing synths of ""High Fashion"" to the Madonna""Ray of Light""-cosplay ""Aquamarine"" atop a house beat and its chantable, spoken chorus: ""The world is my oyster / Baby, come touch the pearl / The world is my oyster / And I\'m the only girl.""', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Cox Media Group.

She details her journey to 'Addison,' and how it helped her fully believe in herself."", 'In the midst of brat summer, Addison Rae strutted onto the stage at Los Angeles\' Shrine Auditorium. Joining her headlining friend Charli xcx for their ""Von Dutch"" remix, Rae\'s guest appearance was much more than just unabashed, spontaneous fun — it marked the beginning of a liberating new chapter.', 'Along with being Rae\'s first-ever live performance, the surprise moment set the tone for the confident singer/songwriter that would arrive with the sultry hit ""Diet Pepsi"" two months later. And almost exactly one year since her cameo with Charli, Rae is doubling down on her self-assured star power with her debut album, Addison.', ""Reflected by its colorful, kaleidoscopic album cover, Addison renders the vivid nature of Rae's artistic vision. Though she first saw success as a dancer (and one of the world's most famous at that, with more than 110 million followers and five billion likes across social media platforms collectively), Rae has focused more on music in recent years — and Addison epitomizes her multifacetedness."", '""It\'s all under this one big umbrella of entertainment and performance: acting, dance, writing music,"" Rae tells GRAMMY.com. ""Provoking people and getting them to feel things and question things and almost have an unexplainable feeling or desire to think about something deeper… it all kind of guides me in the same way. It\'s like, how can that feeling be activated the most intensely?""\n\nRae has been chasing that feeling ever since she moved to Los Angeles in 2019 to pursue dance and content creation full time. While the feeling almost instantly resonated with a social media audience, it presented some challenges as she explored other avenues. Upon releasing her debut single, ""Obsessed,"" in 2021, it seemed the public was determined to still see Rae as an influencer, not yet an artist. The single was largely panned by critics, leaving her to question her musical path (""I just thought,', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'PHOTO: COURTESY OF BEAUTIFUL MINDS', 'INTERVIEW', 'The acclaimed singer/songwriter details the people and experiences that motivated him to create his first album since 2018 — and how the result is him in purest form.', ""From the outside looking in, it would seem like the past seven years have been the best of Jon Bellion's life. Along with co-writing/producing hits by the likes of Miley Cyrus, Jungkook, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, and Selena Gomez — and earning four GRAMMY nominations for his work with Jon Batiste, Justin Bieber, and Lizzo — he became a father to three boys. But it was also the singer/songwriter/producer's most treacherous stretch."", 'Since releasing his last album, Glory Sound Prep, in November 2018, Bellion has been fighting to buy himself out of his Live Nation contract and reclaim his masters. For a time, he relinquished any hope of resuming his solo career and even considered walking away from music altogether. ', ""Bellion founded Beautiful Minds Records and Beautiful Minds Publishing in 2019, from which he and his peers dispatched some of the hottest records of the past several years, but he didn't finalize owning his masters until 2024. Even after winning his legal battle, he warred internally over putting out solo music again. Ultimately, he realized he had experienced a luxury most artists in his position don't have time to experience: Normal life."", '""Nobody walks away for six years and then comes back and says, \'This is what I\'ve learned in six years of being away from the machine,\'"" Bellion tells GRAMMY.com. ""To walk away for six years, develop myself as a person, and then come back? People don\'t get that opportunity. Ever! It almost provides this cheat code perspective because I\'ve seen the tops of the mountaintops. I\'ve seen the worried king on the throne. I\'ve seen his anxiety, and I dodged that bullet.""', 'So, his first move after gaining control over his artistry was self-funding Father Figure, his third solo LP out now.

"In 2025, does an artist’s roll-out matter more than their album?",https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/features/sabrina-carpenter-manchild-album-release/image-gallery/9aada576ef3554984f794b6d2af07e1e,"['HOME / CULTURE / FEATURES', 'Enter the chronology of the hyper visual popstar.', 'Image credit: Columbia Records ', 'Today is the day. Not any day, for the record, but the day where Addison (sans Rae) has dropped her debut album Addison. Since the confirmation a couple weeks ago, a slew of things have happened all at once. She put out the now notorious ‘Headphones on’, which we’ve elegised as our own millennial hangup. Our new pop princess has released a constellation of visuals, each more high-strung and elaborate than the last. ', ""The Lana divergent-Americana route of ‘Diet Pepsi' had the singer weaving in and out of a moving vehicle, title drink in hand. In ‘Headphones on’, she’s hopping over Icelandic boulders, fluoro-pink hair billowing behind her. Her fizzing falsetto sister, ‘Fame is a Gun’ followed—the final piece of the puzzle before the entire album landed. In the music video, Addison is donning a different wig—more of a peroxide blonde, paired with enormous tinted shaders—from which she sulks behind at the crown of a dinner party. "", 'And that’s just on the matter of video work. Addison has scrapped the album cover twice, unseating the image of her younger self with a brand new visual—a coral-hued design of the singer wrapped in a veil, her newly minted moniker printed on the side. Online, the anticipation has hummed until this very moment.  The roll-out has been extensive, to say the least. Yet even before the music had landed, many found one thing certain—we are cresting the reign of a new pop princess. ', 'Image credit: Courtesy of Sabrina Carpenter ', 'Then in the case of Sabrina Carpenter, something else was decidedly afoot. The Sweetener songstress had uploaded a short teaser of herself sticking her hand out, in the hopes of nabbing anyone’s car on the highway. She’s wearing pint-sized shorts and a white dress shirt tied at the rib, a cutaway, for those in the know, to Paul Verhoeven’s Showgirls. ‘This one’s about you!!” reads the instagram caption to the video—which many have taken to be an arrow to ex-partner Barry Keoghan. On Twitter, the video has racked up 553,000 likes. The preview is soundless, apart from a breathy “Oh boy!” from Carpenter which punctuates the ending. The snippet also revealed that the tribute-in-song would drop at 8pm ET on June 5th. ‘Manchild’ will be the start of a new sonic slate from Carpenter, who has not dropped any music since the deluxe edition of Short n’ Sweet in February. ', 'The hypervisualisation of the pop star—or, should we say, marketing whiz?—has shifted the gameplay of music as an entirely commercial process. None of this is new. Music and marketing has generated a particularly robust arm of business in the entertainment sector for many years. But on the matter of how roll-outs weigh up compared to the actual music itself, the scales seem to be evening out. In order to be heard today, there’s an entire assembly line of marketing that has to travel before the music even gets pushed out. Which begs the question: do we care more about an album release than the album itself? ', 'Image credit: Columbia Records ', 'Beyoncé can answer that. The Cowboy Carter tour is kicking off across the continent of Europe, with star-studded, horse-bucking sequences—Rumi and Blue Ivy amongst them. Knowles, who has created entire universes around her sequence of work, Acts I, II and III, has been evasive as to when (or even what) the final album will entail. Speculative trails over the thematics, release date and continuity of each act raged, but Knowles withheld. On the topic of the never-materialised visuals, Beyonce addressed the matter in her Renaissance concert film. “You are the visual, baby,” the screen announces, before cutting to live footage of her 56-city tour. The film grossed $44.4 million worldwide. ', 'The conversation cannot continue in good faith without mention of Taylor Swift. Polarising as she may be, her recent re-acquiral of her entire musical catalogue has rocketed online. The image of a diminutive Swift with her records sprawled in a fan around her sealed the deal. Tearstreaked Swifties lauded the decision as meteoric in pop culture—which, in a way, it was. If an announcement of Swift retaining her body of work—not even putting a single out—reared this reaction, then music isn’t really music without a marketing tail, is it? ', '', '', 'Image credit: Getty Images ', 'Onto Charli. Last year was, without reservation, the Brat year. The iconography of a lime green square spitting out title tracks in narrow Arial dominated everything in our field of vision. Her music project was ambitious, despite the metric of affected slovenliness she hauled. Von Dutch, 360s, baby tees, and a band of It girls, Charli XCX had the public eating right out her palm. And thanks to a well-placed capitalisation, she’s managed to further that influence through the revival of ‘party 4 u’ from her fourth studio album, ‘How I’m feeling now’. A music video was released for the first time on May 15 this year, in alignment with the fifth anniversary of the original album release. New visuals, old song, and a brand new lease on life—at least on TikTok. ', 'Image credit: Getty Images ', 'A sidebar: the formula is not for everyone. Least of all for Gangster Nancy Sinatra, Lana Del Rey, who, despite a pantheon of fans, (47.5 million on Spotify, did you know?) has never cohered to the structure of a roll-out. Her untitled album to follow ‘Do you know there’s a tunnel under ocean boulevard’ has been gathering dust for a while after two characteristic delays. Yet, the flame doesn’t flicker. Her listenership has only shuttled upwards, especially after her historic performance at Coachella last year. The reason Del Rey lands out of hot water despite a tepid promotion of her singles at best, is because she is a shoo-in at what she does. The air of mystery anchors suspense, too, and lends itself to the singer’s own notoriety. When Del Rey introduces a new body of work, it’s at her live concerts. At her last Sydney concert in 2018, the singer dove into a then-unheard ‘Happiness is a Butterfly’ with very little preamble. She dangles the catnip before droves of her fans, who, despite not having much to work with release-wise, are connecting with Lana’s music, perhaps the way she wants her fanbase to—in communion with herself, and with no flash. ', 'Image credit: Columbia Records ', 'Let us be very clear: cheap tricks do not make a good album. No matter how the machinery of marketing roll-outs churns away, the music still has to tick all the boxes. And in Addison Rae’s case, just like her mentioned predecessors, she’s managed to have her cake and eat it too. ‘Addison’, upon review, is a twelve track heavy-hitter that lives up to its premature fame. Entries like the spitting, XCX-modeled ‘New York’, and the percussive soliloquy to the lovelorn ways of ‘Summer Forever’ all synthesise a body of work that, despite its briefness, is solid. Rae is an artist who has honed in on how to sell her sonic identity while still figuring it out. From her earliest days contorting in front of her phone, maybe one of the reasons she’s succeeding is because Addison’s always been in charge of her own visuals.

Addison Rae Found Catharsis on the Dance Floor With Her Live Debut of ‘Addison’,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/addison-rae-found-catharsis-dance-125700043.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Addison Rae lost herself and found herself again.', 'With the release of her highly anticipated debut album, we saw a rebirth right before our eyes. Rebirth, rebrand, reintroduction—whatever you call it—the Louisiana-born TikTok dancer transformed into one of the most promising pop acts of the current age with the release of “Diet Pepsi” last summer. Since then, skeptics and day 1 superfans have tuned in to watch her every move, whether it’s because of the push-and-pull of her hot girl next door persona or her slinky hooks and booming production from her collaborators, Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd.', 'So, when I got word that Addison and Spotify were hosting a rare live show on the eve of her album release, I knew I had to be there. Especially because it would technically be her first official live performance of tracks from her self-titled debut album.', 'She took center stage at New York’s famously sleazy and glamorous nightclub, The Box, which acted as her playground for the night. The room was filled to the brim with magazine editors, late-night producers, and devoted fans who waited hours for a glimpse of the star. Bushwick’s elite even crossed the bridge to Manhattan to capture the newly minted pop princess in all her glory. As aerial artists and dancers donned lingerie underneath burning disco balls, I brushed shoulders with Addison’s star-studded stan list, from Julia Fox, Richie Shazam, and Amelia Gray to Conan Gray, Lola Tung, and Clairo.', 'The intimate inauguration marked a new beginning for Addison. As she opened her set with “Fame Is a Gun” in a kitschy satin bed, bated breaths escaped the lips of attendees who couldn’t take their eyes off her.', 'The mic was on, and soon enough, she treated fans with her original cabaret-inspired “musical theater” rendition of “High Fashion.” Her it girl-in-crime, Lexee Smith, served a campy, melodramatic poetry reading in Louboutins in between one of her outfit changes as a makeshift interlude until Addison returned for a particularly transcendental moment.', 'When the opening notes of “Aquamarine” trickled through The Box’s theater, not one word was missed by fans. I even overheard a friend over my shoulder say, “This song is so gay.” (Complimentary. Not in the way that would prompt Hilary Duff to pull her allyship card.)', 'As Addison hit her marks in a flowy bright blue mini dress, we not only found catharsis on the dance floor—she did, too.', 'In 2021, I covered the early days of Addison’s crossover from TikTok to real-world fame at Seventeen, and I’ll admit it: I was always intrigued by her essence, but I wasn’t totally sold on “Obsessed” once it dropped.', 'It wasn’t until one of my best friends dragged me to our living room to catch her performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that I locked in and saw her for what she truly was: a small-town girl aching for the life of a big-city star. Let it be known that this was the moment she unlocked her potential as a Main Pop Girl in my eyes. From then on, I fully understood her vision. When most of her catalogue leaked in 2022, I clicked play for research purposes and fully became hooked by the following summer.', 'Before her 7-track performance last night, she teased what could come from the Addison Rae live experience, making cameos with her close friends and collaborators on multiple occasions. There was the “Von Dutch” remix at Charli XCX’s pre-brat Boiler Room set in Brooklyn and their post-brat performance on Coachella’s main stage, her “Arcamarine” stint during Arca’s more intimate set in the desert, and, of course, “Diet Pepsi” with Charli and Troye Sivan’s Sweat tour stop at Madison Square Garden. These moments inched us closer to the glittery dance pop world of Addison, yet we didn’t see the star fully in her element. Until now.', 'She’s no stranger to a Britney Spears comparison—in fact, she seems to fully welcome it, knowing they’re both hometown heroes in Louisiana—but she pays homage to her heroes. In interviews, she’s openly named Britney, Madonna, Prince, and Michael Jackson as influences. On her tongue-in-cheek satirical number, “Money Is Everything,” she wistfully sings about her dream blunt rotation with Lana Del Rey and Lady Gaga after name-dropping Norma Jean. It’s abundantly clear she’s at the top of her class as a pop culture student, and she’s well on her way to becoming a teacher.', 'She no longer has to dream of being seen, because all eyes are on her...and they’ll stay there.', 'Stream ‘Addison’ on Spotify', 'You Might Also Like', 'Here’s What NOT to Wear to a Wedding', 'Meet the Laziest, Easiest Acne Routine You’ll Ever Try']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFTREZSWlVWeVZFVk9iVWhFVFJDRkF4aV9CQ2dLTWdhcFFveU9vUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

"Music Review: On Addison Rae’s 'Addison,' a new pop powerhouse is born",https://www.ivpressonline.com/entertainment/music-review-on-addison-rae-s-addison-a-new-pop-powerhouse-is-born/article_16e57361-0951-5891-8d56-d16d77194f96.html,"['', '', '', '', 'This cover image released by Columbia Records shows ""Addison"" by Addison Rae.', '', 'NEW YORK (AP) — The pop album of the summer is here. Addison Rae’s debut, “Addison,” is full, stuffed with bejeweled, hypnotic pop songs for the post-“BRAT” crowd. Hedonism has a new hero.', 'For those who’ve watched her rise, it’s almost impossible to believe. It wasn’t so long ago – almost exactly a year into the COVID-19 pandemic – that a young Rae went on “The Tonight Show” and taught its host Jimmy Fallon a few stiff, meme-able TikTok dance moves, then what made up the bulk of her career. It was met with almost immediate backlash, as is common for young women with viral posts. But she wielded it like a weapon: Social media celebrity begat acting roles for Rae, then a coveted collaboration with Charli XCX in the form of a “Von Dutch” remix, and now, at age 24, her final form: becoming the hyper-ambitious, hyper-femme pop star for the current moment.', 'As a full body of work, “Addison” taps into the genre-agnostic zeitgeist, where pop music appears edgy and elastic. The songs speak for themselves, from the pitch-shifted trip-hop “Headphones On” and the snapped percussion, minor chords, NSFW lyrics and vanishing synths of “High Fashion” to the Madonna“Ray of Light”-cosplay “Aquamarine” atop a house beat and its chantable, spoken chorus: “The world is my oyster / Baby, come touch the pearl / The world is my oyster / And I’m the only girl.”', 'Humor and girlhood are intertwined with less of a Sabrina Carpenter-wink and more of cheery irony. “Money loves me,” she yells on “Money Is Everything.” “I’m the richest girl in the world!” Then, a giggle and a kiss. (“Girl,” to this writer’s count, is uttered 20 times across the album. Across its 12 tracks, she is both the divine feminine and the girl next door. Often, they are one in the same.)', 'Rae isn’t reinventing the wheel here, but she is carefully pulling from her inspirations. Her story recalls Britney Spears: The pair are from Louisiana, became famous young, and recorded their unique, sensual, layered pop music in Stockholm, Sweden, in and around super producer Max Martin. There’s the earned Lana Del Rey parity, like in the “Born to Die”-channeling “Diet Pepsi,” echoes of Charli in the bouncy opener “New York,” and tinges of ethereal Enya production on the dreamy “Summer Forever.”', 'For “Addison,” Rae partnered with two primary collaborators – Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd, who goes simply by Elvira – an unusually small team for a major label pop release. But that intimacy is one of the album’s superpowers, a sensibility that teeters between close mic recordings and big late-night anthems. In the latter case, look no further than “Fame Is a Gun,” an easy song-of-the-summer contender, a sunglasses-in-the-club banger with synthetic vocal textures and an unignorable chorus.', 'In the lead up to the release of “Addison,” Rae has positioned her early TikTok fame as a means to an end. There aren’t many avenues to Hollywood from Lafayette, Louisiana, and social media, for some, is a democratizing tool. Rae used her dance training to build a name for herself on the platform, something that has no doubt laid an ideal foundation for pop superstardom – just consider how Justin Bieber did something similar with covers on YouTube not so many years ago. It feels full circle, then, that Rae’s stellar debut album aims to do what her videos on TikTok attempted to do, what she’s always wanted to do — dance, and get others to dance, too.', 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.
