"Sabrina Carpenter Releases ‘Manchild’ Video, a Cheeky Romp Through the Desert With Car Explosions, Shotguns, Sharks, Pigs and Very Poor Choices of Men",https://www.aol.com/sabrina-carpenter-releases-manchild-courting-005824046.html,"['', '', 'UPDATED: The day after releasing the audio version of her new single, “Manchild,” Sabrina Carpenter has dropped a Friday morning music video for the song, a cheeky (in every way) romp through the desert in which the micro-Daisy-Dukes-wearing pop star hitchhikes her way through a series of encounters with inept but mostly unthreatening men. She wields a shotgun, drinks wine through a straw in the shotgun seat, watches one of her drivers accidentally accelerate a car off a cliff, hits a motel pool to go swimming with sharks and goes hot-tubbing with pigs, not to mention encountering a succession of male chauvinist pigs who represent poor choices of rides and/or men in general.', 'Directed by Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia, the video follows Thursday night’s release of a single that some fans are confident will be a contender in the Song of the Summer race… even if not necessarily every guy will necessarily be singing along as Carpenter drags the un-fairer sex.', 'More from Variety', ""Sabrina Carpenter to Release New Single, 'Manchild'"", ""Maren Morris on Addressing Divorce, Religion and a Single Woman's Freedom in Pop-Leaning 'Dreamsicle' Album: 'It's Taken Me Years to Live Up to the Boldness of My Own Music'"", ""Airbnb Will Let You Book Celeb-Hosted 'Experiences' With Megan Thee Stallion, Sabrina Carpenter, Seventeen, Patrick Mahomes and More"", 'Following an introductory, ’80s-sounding synth riff that sounds almost straight out of “He’s So Shy” or “What a Fool Believes,” Carpenter comically lays into one fool in particular. “Manchild, why you always come a-runnin’ to me?” she sings. “Fuck my life, won’t you let an innocent woman be? / Never heard of self-care / Half your brain just ain’t there…” But she takes some credit for her own poor choices: “Oh, I like my boys playin’ hard to get / And I like my men all incompetent.”', 'Carpenter talked about the creation of the song in an Instagram post. “I wrote ‘Manchild’ on a random Tuesday with Amy and Jack not too long after finishing ‘Short n’ Sweet’ and it ended up being the best random Tuesday of my life,” the singer wrote, referring to Jack Antonoff (who co-produced the track with her) and Amy Allen.', '“Not only was it so fun to write, but this song became to me something I can look back on that will score the mental montage to the very confusing and fun young adult years of life. It sounds like the song embodiment of a loving eye roll and it feels like a never ending road trip in the summer! Hence why i wanted to give it to you now — so you can stick your head out the car window and scream it all summer long!”', 'She concluded, “Thank you always and forever for listening” — although she added a P.S. that indicated not everyone out there is such a good listener: “And thank you men for testing me!!”', 'The new tune is very much in the tradition of “Please, Please, Please” and other songs that have found Carpenter putting members of the opposite sex in their collective place.', 'The song is widely assumed to be the first single from Carpenter’s seventh album, although no actual news has been promised along those lines. Her IG comments saying she just wanted to put it out for summer could be a deflection against expectations that any full-length project is immediately looming, especially when the deluxe version of her last album is still a weekly staple of the Billboard 200 chart.', 'As she did with her mega hit “Espresso” for Coachella last year, Carpenter will likely give the song its live debut during her festival appearance at Primavera Sound in Barcelona on Friday.', '', 'Best of Variety', '25 Hollywood Legends Who Deserve an Honorary Oscar', 'New Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week ', ""Emmy Predictions: Animated Program — Can Netflix Score Big With 'Arcane,' 'Devil May Cry' and the Final Season of 'Big Mouth?'"", ""Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

The Short n’ Sweet pop star debuted her latest song, “Manchild,” on June 5, marking her first single of 2025.', 'With assists from her frequent collaborators Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen, the song sees Carpenter lean into Short n’ Sweet’s country-pop dispositions once more. On “Manchild,” Carpenter complains about being pursued by a man she thinks is either stupid or “maybe useless.”', 'On the chorus, she pleads, “Man-child/Why you always come a-running to me?/F*** my life/Won’t you let an innocent woman be?/Never heard of self-care/Half your brain just ain’t there/Man-child/Why you always come a-running, taking all my life from me?”', 'In the second verse, Carpenter asks, “Why so sexy if so dumb?/And how survive the Earth so long?”', 'The twangy single comes four days after Carpenter originally teased its release on social media.

I need her to go back to more meaningful lyrics.”', '“manchild slander is propaganda i will not be falling for,” one fan declared on X.', 'Some fans have also noted that the release of “Manchild” comes almost one year after Carpenter debuted her single “Please Please Please” and its accompanying music video, which features her ex-boyfriend the actor Barry Keoghan. The “Busy Woman” singer, however, seems to have addressed speculation that the new song is specifically about him.', '“i wrote manchild on a random tuesday with amy and jack not too long after finishing short n’ sweet and it ended up being the best random tuesday of my life,” Carpenter wrote in an Instagram caption. “not only was it so fun to write, but this song became to me something I can look back on that will score the mental montage to the very confusing and fun young adult years of life.”', 'The Grammy winner described “Manchild” as the “embodiment of a loving eye roll.”', '“it feels like a never ending road trip in the summer ! hence why i wanted to give it to you now- so you can stick your head out the car window and scream it all summer long! thank you always and forever for listening and thank you men for testing me!! 🐷🤍”']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU1RbVZ6UmxwQk1DMUpOM0IxVFJDSEF4aVBCaWdLTWdhOU01aFNIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Sabrina’s Lesson in Men,https://www.laineygossip.com/sabrina-carpenters-new-single-manchild-is-a-f-ck-you-to-men-in-general/82263,"['She begged him to do right, seriously she begged him. The boy everyone believes to be at the centre of this conversation is Barry Keoghan, but after listening to Sabrina Carpenter’s new single “Manchild”, which just dropped last night, it seems that the song is a f-ck you to men in general. ', 'Is it the best song I’ve ever heard sonically? Not on first listen, but it definitely is fun and has a similar country-pop essence to “Please, Please, Please”. Think Shania Twain circa-2002, just more sexually explicit. I can’t imagine Shania singing the lyrics “did you just say we’re finished? Didn’t know we started”. However, I can see myself being obsessed within a week or two, and those usually are the songs that stick. Whether or not the two songs’ similarities were intentional is unknown, but if we’ve learnt anything about Sabrina, it’s that she loves an Easter egg. ', 'Not her pointing AT Barry on Instagram ðŸ˜« #sabrinacapenter #manchild #barry pic.twitter.com/M9ifwaPgVK', ""When she announced the single on Instagram in this cheeky (literally lol) teaser from the music video, she captioned it “this one’s about you!!!”. Barry famously deactivated his social media soon after the breakup reports first surfaced amid a slew of online hate after the cheating rumours (oh, we’re getting into it) and a caption like that plays up the online chatter and in response gets the public more interested in the single and potential new album, go off queen. Side bar: I want the confidence to wear shorts that short now that I've got a Pilates booty lol. "", 'The video, directed by Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia, is super tongue-in-cheek just as we would’ve expected Sabrina to be. We see Sabrina in Daisy Dukes in the middle of what looks like a desert, hitchhiking all while looking like the sexy pin-up doll that she has been cosplaying for the last year – jumping from car to car with different trash men. Trash being the key word here because that scene of her holding onto a garbage truck as she is riding the freeway? It’s a yes for me dog. Plus, those pigs in the bathtub that she is vibing with as she says “hey man!” couldn’t be more transparent. Men are dogs and they are pigs – but they give us what we need when we need a fix so we can’t let go. I see you girl. The video brought the message of the song to life for me and made me appreciate what she was trying to convey way more. ', ' ', 'Fans have noticed that she teased the lyrics “I choose to blame your mom” back in April, which brings on doubts of the song being exclusively about Barry. Barry has talked about his mom’s struggles with addiction in the past, so it seems unlikely Sabrina would go there. She also expresses in her social media post that she wrote the song just after the Short n’ Sweet album came out, leaving the timeline of her and Barry’s relationship questionable since the two were very much together around the time of that album’s release in August 2024. ', 'the way everyone swore Manchild was going to be about Barry only to find out itâ€™s literally a fun cheeky song about practically every single man in existence ðŸ¤¦ðŸ\x8f¾â€\x8dâ™€ï¸\x8f', 'sabrina please keep on being as mean to men as possible #manchild pic.twitter.com/tNn4htD6qn', 'However, she also wrote on that very same post that the song is the “embodiment of a loving eye roll” and even thanks men for “testing” her. While she is certainly insinuating that the song isn’t exclusively about Barry but rather about sh-tty men in general, that still doesn’t take away the Easter eggs in the song that can be connected to her relationship with Mr. Saltburn. Let’s unpack shall we?', 'Not her pointing AT Barry on Instagram ðŸ˜« #sabrinacapenter #manchild #barry pic.twitter.com/M9ifwaPgVK', 'It was reported back in December that the two had split up and the rumour mill had a field day. Let’s be honest, every time a popular celebrity couple breaks up there are going to be rumours. What we don’t do is then feed into them by reposting TikToks that could insinuate that there is truth to them. I’m talking to you Breckie Hill. Hill would eventually clarify her misstep, but whether or not it is true, to me this is an example of many TikTok influencers’ lack of media literacy and ability to handle a PR crisis. ', 'If Breckie with the good hair didn’t get some Keoghan dick out of this (ew), at the very least she could use some media training. Also don’t get my bitch Sabrina involved in unnecessary drama like this. If the lyrics to “Manchild” are any indication, cheating doesn’t seem to be the case anyway. In fact, it kind of sounds like he was just a f-king idiot lol – allegedly of course. Anyone who sings lyrics like “half your brain just ain’t there” and “I like my men all incompetent” is definitely sending some kind of message, and being with a man of intelligence is not it lol. ', 'Perhaps the most ambiguous Easter egg connecting the song to Barry is the consistent use of the Irish fiddle throughout the songs instrumentals. Barry is an Irishman from Dublin, and Sabrina even mentioned how those Irish boys are “hard work” during a recent concert there. The fiddle is one of the most associated instruments with traditional Irish music, and given that it is also commonly used in country music, the incorporation into “Manchild” makes sense, especially around the last minute of the song. Sabrina and Jack Antonoff can deny it all they want but my girl is a shady bitch, and I mean that in the best way because so am I, so if this wasn’t a dig at Barry then maybe I can teach her a thing or two. If it is – then bravo my love, well f-cking done. ', 'Beyoncé said this best back in 2011, but women should be running the world. I’m a firm believer that majority of men have an issue with maturity. Not to get political, but yesterday’s bitch fight between the two men I refuse to refer to by name is a prime example. The fact that Sabrina chose to drop a country-pop song about a “Manchild” on the very day that two of the world’s biggest culprits are having their own break-up is just even better promo than I could’ve predicted myself. I didn’t expect the first break-up during Pride month to be those two buffoons but hey, it’s 2025 and I should expect the unexpected. ', 'Sabrina Carpenter dropping Manchild during Elon and Trumpâ€™s messy divorce pic.twitter.com/taU6b4Xsy5', 'funny how the president and the richest man in the world are beefing on social media on sabrinaâ€™s MANCHILD release day, just proving her point', 'sabrinaâ€™s promo for the release of manchild is immaculate. she has 2 grown men arguing online proving her point pic.twitter.com/1N3a9YkWd0', 'Moral of the story is that men suck. Groundbreaking, I know. As if my six years of being single and dating losers in Toronto wasn’t enough of an indication. However, Sabrina does have a way of validating those of us who are victim to the spell of testosterone. She sings it best in the outro: “I swear they choose me; I’m not choosing them”.

Why aren't kids being free-ranged like how you were raised?"", ""I asked many of the emailers who told me all about their childhoods to answer the ‘What’s changed' question. "", '— Chris A. writes: ', ""Definitely the well-publicized kidnappings of kids in the 70s and 80s. Around DC, there was the kidnapping and murder of the Lyon sisters when they went, unaccompanied, to a local shopping center to get ice cream. They were 10 and 12 at the time. Their dad, John, was a big radio personality in DC in the 70s, and the whole region immediately became terrified that the same thing could happen to their kids. From that point on, at least around here, kids were tethered to their parents, because they didn't know who did it until several years ago."", '— Anonymous shares his recent experience that has him thinking about both sides of the free-range parenting idea: ', ""I am currently 44.  Until age 8, I lived in an apartment complex whose parking lot abutted the town park.  From as early as I can remember, I would go to the town park by myself and throw sticks into the creek, play on the playground, etcetera.  I'm not sure how much permission I needed (i.e., I probably told my mom before I went over there, just so she knew where I was), but I was definitely alone at least some of the time.  We then moved into a house out in the sticks, and so I would just invent games in my yard or in my basement, so I was pretty much on our property at all times, and then it all became moot."", ""I don't remember the year exactly, but in my area of the country, a big story for several years on the local news was the disappearance of Sarah Anne Wood, probably when I was about 10 years old.  If memory serves, she was abducted and subsequently murdered while riding her bike home from school.  It was the worst-case scenario.  In talking to other Gen-Xers from all over the country, everyone always remembers the 'milk-carton kids'.  So those kinds of events have definitely shaped the psyches of modern parents."", ""I'm torn on the issue.  My house abuts the property of our elementary school, so there's an acre at least of fields and playgrounds that my kids can go play on at any time.  I encourage them to go over there.  However, I want them to either go with a friend or one of their siblings, mostly in case someone gets hurt and needs an adult to help them, but also because a subset of my neighbors do not share my views on this topic.  A couple of weeks ago, my 7 year-old daughter left the house without telling me to go for a walk, approximately at dusk.  As I'm doing the dishes, she comes running into the house via the side door in a panic that somebody was following her.  About 10 seconds later, I hear a loud, frantic knock on my front door.  I open the door, and there's a teenager with a spooked expression on his face.  He begins to explain to me that a car had been following my daughter closely, so this teenager and his friend decide that they should start following him.  And, the guy in the car that was following my daughter was parked outside my house.  So at this point, I've got three cars parked on the street outside my house."", ""Now, if this person who had been following my daughter had nefarious intentions, he surely wouldn't have stopped and parked outside my house.  So, figuring this was a misunderstanding, I walk down to talk to the guy.  Out of the car pops the former mayor of our city, who happens to live in my neighborhood.  He said he saw my daughter walking alone in the evening hours and thought it was strange, so he called 911 and decided to follow her.  I said, 'thank you for your concern', but also that nothing was wrong.  Anyways, I guess he called 911 back to report my address.  About 10 minutes later, a local police officer knocks on the door.  I think he may have been on my front stoop for a maximum of 30 seconds; he couldn't have been better about the situation.  He just asked if everything was okay, I said that it was, and he was on his way.  I had a small conversation with my daughter about leaving the house without telling me, and given that the police showed up at our house, I think the message got through."", ""At the end of everything, I was torn.  On the one hand, it felt good that there were several people who saw someone they thought was vulnerable and kept an eye on them to make sure everything was ok.  On the other hand, it saddens me that the childhood that I grew up with doesn't exist at the moment because everyone is up in everybody else's business.  The freedom to roam and screw up from time to time is gone.  I'm doing what I can to bring it back a little bit, but it's definitely a fight against the tide.

Sabrina Carpenter's 'Manchild' Is Putting Every Woman's Red Flag Ex On Notice (Thank Goodness),https://www.women.com/1879878/sabrina-carpenter-manchild-red-flag-exes-called-out/,"['', 'Sabrina Carpenter dropped her first single of 2025 on June 5, thrilling fans with the sassy yet playful message of ""Manchild."" Created alongside collaborators Amy Allen and Jack Antonoff, Carpenter\'s latest tune offers not just a catchy beat but some heartfelt truths about dating. As might be abundantly clear by the title, Carpenter gives some zinging digs to the men in her past. ""Manchild / Why you always come a-running to me? F*** my life / Won\'t you let an innocent woman be? Never heard of self-care / Half your brain just ain\'t there/"" she sings in the chorus. The message is clearly a woman lamenting a toxic ex, who drained her with his incompetence, lies, and selfishness. ', 'The song may or may not have been directed at Carpenter\'s ex, Barry Keoghan. The two parted ways in December 2024, and fans weren\'t terribly surprised. Keoghan and Carpenter\'s relationship had tons of red flags, including rumors of Keoghan\'s infidelity. When Carpenter announced the release of ""Manchild"" on Instagram, she wrote in the caption: ""this one\'s about you!!"" The ""you"" is undefined, but fans are free to fill in the blanks. Some pointed out the song was released conveniently on the anniversary of ""Please Please Please,"" which featured Keoghan in the music video. The contrast between the two songs couldn\'t be more clear: While the 2024 synth pop song had Carpenter lovesick and worried that her lover would end up like every man who previously broke her heart, ""Manchild"" comes through confidence and attitude after realizing he was indeed just like the others — only this time, she\'s finally over it.', '', 'Whatever happened between the two, it\'s clear from the lyrics of ""Manchild"" that Carpenter isn\'t holding back. She calls the ex ""stupid,"" ""slow,"" and ""useless"" in the track, and even blames his mother for his emotional unavailability. Though it may seem harsh, many of Carpenter\'s fans took to the internet to express how relatable they found the experience Carpenter described. ""Manchild is for the girls who realize it was their love that made them special"" wrote one user on TikTok. Another added ""We\'re all dating the same guy"" over another video reacting to the tune, highlighting the universality of the experience.', '', 'While Sabrina Carpenter\'s hit song, ""Manchild"" pokes at toxic exes and their careless behavior – and we love putting those toxic exes on alert – she also gives a little tough love to herself in the song. It\'s not surprising because we\'ve gotten a lot of quality dating advice from Carpenter\'s songs. She calls herself out on dating patterns that might not be the best. Carpenter sings: ""Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get / And I like my men all incompetent / And I swear they choose me, I\'m not choosing them."" Carpenter isn\'t shy to dish it out to exes, but she also gently calls out her own relationship patterns of choosing the wrong men. ', 'The music video for ""Manchild"" stresses this point even more, as Carpenter hitchhikes along a highway, and jumps in and out of beater cars, driven by even less lovely men. She goes from one car to the next, with each vehicle offering some new form of disaster. We love a gal who can give a jab, but who can also identify her own part in dysfunctional relationships. ""Okay, I get it: each car is a relationship—chaotic, makes no sense, sometimes full of danger—and jumping out of one car into another is Sabrina jumping into a new, uncertain (but almost predictably wild) relationship,"" a fan commented on YouTube. Plus, the video is loaded with fabulous outfit changes, including one Dasiy Duke ensemble that proves that Carpenter is still a fan of retro trends. There\'s so much to love here!

Why Did Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan Break Up? Everything We Know,https://www.instyle.com/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-breakup-11747575,"['Fans think her new single ‘Manchild’ is about him.', 'Kevin Mazur/MG24/Getty Images', 'Sabrina Carpenter’s new era is coming, and it might shed light on her breakup with Irish actor Barry Keoghan. On June 3, the pop star made a cheeky Instagram post announcing her new single “Manchild,” out June 8. The manchild in question? Fans believe it’s none other than Keoghan, whom the artist split from in December 2024, according to People. In the caption of her single announcement, Carpenter even wrote, “this one’s about you!!”', 'It wouldn’t be the first time the Saltburn actor popped up in his former flame’s music. In 2024’s “Please Please Please,” Carpenter sang about wanting her actor partner—presumably, then-boyfriend Keoghan—to “act like a stand-up guy.”  The catchy chorus has her begging said partner not to embarrass her in, well, less polite terms. Erasing any doubt that the track is about Keoghan, he appeared in the music video as a rough-and-tumble prisoner falling for her from behind bars.', ""“I was like, 'Who's the greatest actor that I can find for this music video?' And he was next to me in a chair,” Carpenter, 26, told CBS Sunday Morning last year of casting him. “And he was so excited about it.”"", ""The pair haven’t publicly commented on their breakup, but a source told People their busy schedules were the reason behind the sudden split. “They are both young and career-focused, so they've decided to take a break,” the insider shared. Despite this statement, the lyrics of “Please Please Please” have Carpenters (her fanbase’s nickname) convinced Keoghan, 32, didn’t heed the song’s warnings about his behavior."", 'Dominik Bindl/GA/The Hollywood Reporter via Getty Images', 'For his part, Keoghan has stayed away from the drama, deactivating his social media in the wake of the breakup. Speaking to Hollywood Authentic in an interview published May 1, he explained, “There was just so much on social media that wasn’t real.” After fans began knocking on his relatives’ doors, he felt the final push to leave social platforms behind for the safety of his family, including his 2-year-old son Brando, who he shares with ex-girlfriend Alyson Sandro', 'In the same interview, he got candid about his sobriety struggles after losing his mother to addiction when he was just 12 years old. “I’m not in denial anymore. I understand that I do have an addiction, and I am an addict,” he shared. “You know, when you accept that, you finally can move on, and learn to work with it.”', 'Carpenter opened up about a different heartbreak in her March 2025 Vogue cover story. She called the relationship that inspired her 2022 album Emails I Can’t Send her “biggest heartbreak to date. My first real one. I hate to say that,” she continued. “It definitely makes all my exes before that feel like shit. I don’t mean to do that. I just think in a sense of really understanding the grieving-someone-that’s-alive feeling. I never felt that until this one.”', 'The Hapa Blonde/GC Images', ""Both the singer and the Hurry Up Tomorrow actor attended the 2025 Met Gala, but didn't cross paths at the star-studded event. Whether or not the former couple ever go public with the details of their split, fans are excited for the pop sensation’s next chapter as a single gal."", '“Manchild” is Carpenter’s first new music since Short n’ Sweet (Deluxe) dropped in February.

The track’s syncopated synths and strum-heavy acoustic guitar show that Carpenter is not interested in wallowing, but “Manchild” isn’t a full-fledged disco celebration either; instead, Carpenter skewers her half-witted beau while hinting that she’s maybe, perhaps, ever-so-slightly accountable, too.', '“Oh, I like my boys playing hard to get/ And I like my men all incompetent/ And I swear they choose me/ I’m not choosing them,” she sings with a wink, recalling a similar conclusion drawn in “Slim Pickins” about her own inability to choose men with long-term relationship potential. Like the hitchhike-through-mayhem absurdity found in the music video, Carpenter knows the cycle well: They meet, it’s thrilling, dangerous even, and eventually, despite her telling herself things could be different this time, he lets her down. “It’s all just so familiar,” she sings.', 'Her lyrics are once again endearingly funny — “If I’m not there it won’t get done/ I choose to blame your mom,” Carpenter quips — and more proof that the trio of Carpenter, Allen, and Antonoff have nailed the SabCarp formula. There’s a nostalgic, comforting air, circa late ’70s and early ’80s, which fits with Carpenter’s retro-themed stage movements and music videos. There’s a slight country twang, which allows Carpenter to slip into a more casual and authentic singing style. And, above all, there’s a sharp, halfway-out-the-door wit that instantly puts the listener in Carpenter’s corner.', 'Humor, used as often as Carpenter employs it, can start to feel like a defense mechanism — like she’s masking her vulnerability. Perhaps there are some meatier epiphanies to come, but in the meantime, she shrugs off a helpless himbo so well on “Manchild” that you’d have to believe she’s landed on her feet.

A metaphor so sharp you could cut your ex off with it.', 'There’s the guy with the motorized recliner, the one with the motorcycle-sidecar-shopping-cart situation, and, of course, the legend who somehow convinced her to ride jet ski-style on the highway. Each moment is a slow-motion disaster of male incompetence as Carpenter lounges, struts, and sighs her way across America’s most absurd forms of transport. Not unlike the emotional vehicles most women are forced to endure in the name of romance.', '“Stupid, or is it slow, maybe it’s useless, but there’s a cuter word for it, I know,” she sings with deadly sweetness. “Manchild.” And then the kicker: “F–k my life, won’t you let an innocent woman be?”', '“Manchild” isn’t just a song. It’s a state of mind. Carpenter crafted the track with hitmaker Amy Allen and producer Jack Antonoff (yes, he’s still everywhere) shortly after wrapping up the recording of her Short n’ Sweet deluxe album. “It ended up being the best random Tuesday of my life,” she confessed on Instagram. Honestly? Same.', 'This song is giving emotional detox. It’s giving therapy but make it pop. It’s giving don’t call me unless you’ve unlearned your mother’s gender roles and fixed your relationship with accountability. Carpenter said it herself. The track scores the “mental montage” of her confusing but iconic young adult years. And if that doesn’t resonate with every woman who’s had to explain empathy to a man in a backwards cap, nothing will.', 'The “Girl Meets World” alum summed up the “Manchild” video with the most delicious Instagram caption of 2025 so far:', '“No animals were harmed in the making but some men were.”', 'Poetry. Literature. Feminist canon. She didn’t just write a breakup anthem. She wrote a thesis.', 'And this isn’t some random side B. “Manchild” follows Carpenter’s massively successful Short n’ Sweet album, which spent four straight weeks dominating the Billboard 200 last year, becoming her first-ever No. 1 project. The deluxe edition only added fuel to her rise, blessing fans with additional tracks like “15 Minutes” and “Bad Reviews” songs that were already dragging the male species, but with a little more subtlety.', 'Not anymore. Subtlety has left the chat.', 'Carpenter’s “Short n’ Sweet” era has been nothing short of a pop masterclass, and she’s far from done. After wrapping her European tour leg, the singer is gearing up to conquer London’s Hyde Park in July before returning to North America for another run of shows. By now, her live performances are less concerts and more cultural reset events. Complete with crowd sing-alongs, rhinestone corsets, and probably a few more digs at whatever man inspired “Manchild.”', 'Let’s be honest. If you’ve ever dated a man who called himself a “feminist” and still thought folding laundry was “helping,” this track is your new anthem. Sabrina Carpenter saw the problem, named it, and then rode away from it on the back of a damn couch with wheels.', 'Sabrina Carpenter has entered her ‘eat, mock, leave’ era. “Manchild” is the logical progression from the caffeine-slick cheek of “Espresso,” a song that didn’t just flirt with world domination, it practically ordered it on Uber Eats. But now, she’s done being cute. She’s sharpening her lyrics like claws and aiming straight at the egos of men who think “emotional intelligence” is a podcast they heard once.', 'So to all the manchildren still trying to understand why she didn’t text back, don’t worry baby. She left you a roadmap. It’s called “Manchild,” and it slaps.', 'The post Sabrina Carpenter Hitchhikes Through Hell in Her “Manchild” Music Video and Somehow Looks Flawless Doing It appeared first on Where Is The Buzz | Breaking News, Entertainment, Exclusive Interviews & More.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU1RbVZ6UmxwQk1DMUpOM0IxVFJDSEF4aVBCaWdLTWdhOU01aFNIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df
