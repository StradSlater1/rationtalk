Several productions have drawn much-desired young audiences, and the season featured a mix of quirky and original shows alongside big-brand spectacle.

The evening was full of live performances, including a medley of ""Hamilton"" songs performed by the original Broadway cast.', ""The attendees included stage actors, Hollywood stars, and even influencers. Some attendees came dressed to impress in ball gowns and statement suits, while others' outfits fell flat."", 'Take a look at the best and worst looks celebrities wore to the 2025 Tony Awards.', 'Michele walked the red carpet in a black tuxedo dress designed by Michael Kors.', 'The neckline dipped low, and a slit cut the skirt on one side, creating a sexy and balanced look. Michele also let the dress speak for itself, wearing black heels and simple jewelry.', 'Strong wore a floor-length, long-sleeve coat dress designed by Badgley Mischka. It had a pretty silhouette, with its collared neckline, belted waist, and full skirt.', 'However, the green dress was covered in an array of hot pink flowers from head to toe. The pattern was overwhelming to the eye, and the look might have been better if Strong wore the coat unbuttoned with an unpatterned shift underneath it to break up the colors.', ""Schiaparelli designed Erivo's taupe gown, which had a regal feel that set the tone for her role as host of the evening."", ""The gown's column skirt had a sheen to it, while the off-the-shoulder bodice was covered in sparkly, floral beading. The neckline hovered around Erivo's frame, playing with structure."", 'Holmes wore a custom Prada ensemble to the Tonys. The look featured the two main colors associated with ""Wicked,"" as it had a high-neck, green blouse and a column-style pink skirt adorned with sparkly beading.', 'The two garments looked like they belonged to different outfits, and the green top in particular felt too casual for the Tonys. Holmes could have stood out on the red carpet if she had paired the skirt with a better top, but the look fell flat as it was.', ""Tamara Ralph Couture designed Amal Clooney's white gown, which had an off-the-shoulder neckline and hugged her figure before ending in a scalloped hem at her ankle."", 'Rows of pearls adorned the dress, making it look like the lawyer was dripping in the gems. White heels with a pointed detail completed her elegant ensemble.', ""George Clooney, on the other hand, just wore a black tuxedo and bow tie for the evening. It's a classic look, but it would have been nice to see him add a fashionable flair to the outfit through a brooch or other accessory."", 'Escola won the Tony for best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play on Sunday for their performance as Mary Todd Lincoln in ""Oh, Mary!""', 'They accepted the award in a custom Wiederhoeft gown that paid tribute to Bernadette Peters, whom Escola used to emulate in YouTube videos and live performances. She also wore a similar dress when she won a Tony in 1999.', ""Escola's soft-blue gown had a corset bodice with a halter neckline. Ruched, off-the-shoulder sleeves made of sparkly fabric coordinated with a swath of matching fabric on Escola's waist, which gave way to a sparkly skirt. A long train trailed behind them, adding glamour to the look."", ""A red wig and choker tied Escola's outfit together."", 'Chenoweth attended the Tonys in a blue gown designed by Christian Siriano.', 'The corset bodice had a pointed neckline with exposed boning and sheer panels on the bodice. The asymmetrical skirt was also transparent, sitting atop a shorter bubble skirt that gave it volume.', ""Everything about Chenoweth's outfit looked like it belonged in 2012 instead of 2025, from the boning and sheer fabric to the electric-blue color. Chenoweth could have updated the look with modern accessories or a fuller skirt."", ""Raver-Lampman's deep-blue suit consisted of a jacket with a bow fastening and wide-legged pants."", 'She wore the suit with no top, exposing her black bra and giving the ensemble a sexy edge.', ""Genny designed Soo's dress, which was made of a sheer fabric in pale pink."", ""The bodice was busy, featuring one strap, a large bow covered in beading on the chest, and a cutout. A fabric ruffle sat on Soo's waist, and the skirt flowed to the floor."", ""Although the dress had interesting elements, like the bow and waist ruffle, the transparent fabric distracted from every other part of the look, making the outfit feel busier than it was. Because the fabric was such a statement, the dress would have been better for Soo if it didn't feature the bow or additional detailing, as it would have offered a cleaner look."", 'The actor and content creator chose an emerald green suit from Naked Wardrobe for the Tonys.', ""Allen wore the oversize jacket open, showing off a low-cut white blouse and the high waistline of his wide-legged trousers. Heeled, white boots peeked out from underneath the pants, and Allen's glasses conveyed a sophisticated feel for the ensemble."", ""Hough's white Christian Siriano gown was pretty. It had a form-fitting silhouette before poofing out in a mermaid skirt made of voluminous tulle."", ""However, the ensemble felt imbalanced because Hough didn't wear any jewelry with the look and kept her bob down."", 'The outfit would have felt more cohesive if she had added statement earrings or a bold necklace. As she wore it, it seemed like Hough just forgot to add accessories.', 'Sink, who was nominated for best performance by an actress in a leading role in a play for her performance in ""John Proctor is the Villain,"" arrived at the Tonys in a custom Prada dress.', 'The silky, silver dress had a low, V-neckline, and it cinched at her waist before flowing into a floor-length skirt with a subtle train. Sparkly, clustered embellishments framed the neckline and formed a bow in the center for a pop of texture.', ""Paired with silver earrings, Sink's gown was glamorous without being over the top."", ""Twiggy Moore designed Lawrence's mermaid-style pink dress. The gown was covered in large black polka dots, a strip of black fabric on the neckline, and a coordinating one on the skirt, complete with a bow."", 'The dark color and size of the polka dots were too much for the dress, and the gown would have looked sleeker if the dots had been smaller or a paler hue.', 'Lawrence was nominated for best performance by a featured artist in a musical at the Tonys.', 'Criss won a Tony for best performance by an actor in a leading role in a musical in ""Maybe Happy Ending,"" which also took home the award for best musical.', 'Criss accepted the award in a black tuxedo, pairing high-waisted, wide-legged pants with a cropped jacket.

The Tony Awards celebrate the strongest Broadway season in recent memory,https://www.avclub.com/tony-awards-2025-oh-mary-sunset-boulevard,"['Broadway is back and better than ever. That seemed to be the main message from last night’s Tony Award ceremony, capping off one of the strongest Broadway seasons in recent memory, and certainly the strongest since the 2020 lockdowns closed Broadway for over a year. The recovery was slow and took years, but it finally feels safe to say that the theaters have recovered. As host Cynthia Erivo said during the ceremony, this was the highest-grossing season in Broadway history. ', 'Some of that financial success can certainly be attributed to the A-list Hollywood talent who came to Broadway this season and drove up ticket prices. (The Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal-starring Othello was perhaps this season’s worst offender, with ticket prices reaching almost $1000. The production didn’t receive any Tony nominations.) But the season’s breakout hits were more often original works by artists who have been grinding it out for years. Oh, Mary! is arguably the season’s biggest success story, opening in early 2024 off-Broadway and becoming not only the first show of the season to recoup its investment, but the rare Broadway show that attracts major fandom outside of New York. The expectation that Cole Escola would win Best Actor for their performance didn’t dull the room’s excitement or pride as they literally ran up to the stage, dressed as Bernadette Peters, to accept their first Tony. Though it didn’t win Best Play (that went to this year’s Pulitzer-winning Purpose), watching both Escola and director Sam Pinkleton get their moments on stage was thrilling. As Pinkleton accepted the award, he thanked Escola for teaching him to “do what you love, not what you think people want to see.” ', '', 'All four of the night’s big acting awards were handed to not just first-time winners, but first-time nominees. Darren Criss, an actor who seemed destined for a Tony since his Glee days, won Best Actor in a Musical for his performance in Maybe Happy Ending, and was also honored as a producer when the show won Best Musical. Sarah Snook’s win for Best Actress in a Play felt pretty in-the-bag going into the night (her performance in The Picture Of Dorian Gray was crazy in a great way) but the award for Best Actress in a Musical was always going to be a tossup between Nicole Scherzinger in Sunset Boulevard and Audra McDonald in Gypsy. McDonald is the performer with the most Tony Awards in history, playing the role that has netted its stars three Tonys since its inception in 1959. Her performance of “Rose’s Turn” on the Tony stage was hair-raising and startling, but the award ultimately went to Scherzinger. The former Pussycat Doll has been establishing her theater bona fides for years, and her performance in Sunset Boulevard was another talk of New York before the show had even transferred from London. It was certainly the category to watch this year, but one that would have resulted in a deserved win no matter what. ', '<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">\ufeff</span>', '', 'Other highlights from the show included a very energetic reunion from the original cast of Hamilton, which celebrates the ten-year anniversary of its Broadway debut this year, and a performance of Death Becomes Her‘s very fun opening number “For The Gaze.” Another highlight: the telecast only went over its allotted three hours by about ten minutes!

Tony Awards: Predicting the Winners Using Just Math,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/tony-awards-prediction-winners-2025-math-zauzmer-1236253818/,"['', '', ""This year's category-by-category look at which musicals and plays have the best chance of claiming honors during the June 8 telecast on CBS, based on a model built on historical data."", 'BY BEN ZAUZMER', '', 'The world will descend on New York on Sunday night, by way of the 78th Tony Awards. Shows set in the U.S., the U.K., Cuba, Italy, and Iran all make their way to the nominees circle. Not to mention a show from South Korea projected to win more Tonys than any other production, potentially the first one ever to premiere in Asia and win best musical.', 'And when I say “projected,” I mean that mathematically. Every year, I run a statistical model based on precursor awards, which categories a show is nominated in, blended critic predictions, and betting markets to project the odds that each nominee will emerge victorious in every category. After another wonderful year on Broadway, with 42 new shows opening and 29 of them receiving nominations, it’s time to get excited for the big night with a data-based forecast at who might triumph at Radio City Music Hall on June 8 on CBS (and Paramount+).', '', 'Maybe Happy Ending is both the name of the show and a surprisingly apt description for how its night at the Tonys will conclude. Emphasis on “maybe”: the model is higher on Dead Outlaw than one might suspect, since it takes into account that show’s multiple honors for its off-Broadway run a year ago.', 'Best play is much closer than best musical, with three productions above a 1-in-5 chance to win. The Drama League has a remarkable streak in this category, predicting every Tony winner since Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike (2013), so that’s enough to put this year’s Drama League pick of Oh, Mary! over the top.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won best musical in 1995, but that was an odd year: only two original musicals opened that season (the other being Smokey Joe’s Café), so the competition wasn’t as stiff as usual. The Sunset Boulevard revival will have a tougher path to the podium with three opponents to beat, Gypsy in particular.', 'Yellow Face is an extremely popular pick here, and could very well win. For one thing, it earned an Outer Critics Circle nod that Eureka Day missed. But when the two went head-to-head at the Drama Desk and Drama League Awards, Eureka Day went 2-for-2.', 'Nine actors have won lead actor in a musical twice, and no one has won more than twice. Not only could Jonathan Groff (Just in Time) become the tenth man on that list, but he could become the first ever to do it in consecutive years after his Merrily We Roll Along win a year ago. The model has him at 19.2 percent, a not-insurmountable 20 percentage points the leader, Darren Criss (Maybe Happy Ending).', '', 'At some point I’ll run out of trivia facts to post about Audra McDonald. She’s already set the all-time record for the most Tony acting wins, with six, and is favored to win her seventh for Gypsy. But Nicole Scherzinger (Sunset Boulevard) is a popular pick as well in what’s shaping up to be both a great race in its own right and a precursor of the musical revival category.', 'Cole Escola is performing double-duty, as both the writer and star of Oh, Mary! and is the clear favorite according to the mathematical model, with Jon Michael Hill in Purpose at a distant runner up.', 'Sarah Snook stars as Dorian Gray – and every other role – and has a 42.8 percent chance to win the Tony for the one-woman show. But close behind her is Laura Donnelly (The Hills of California) at 33.2 percent.', 'Jak Malone (Operation Mincemeat) stands out as not only the favorite in this category, but as the most likely winner across all eight acting categories. Operation Mincemeat is up for four Tonys, but it’s projected to lose each of the other three to Maybe Happy Ending (not nominated in this race), making this category its best chance at a victory.', 'There’s probably a good debate to be had on whether Natalie Venetia Belcon (Buena Vista Social Club) belonged in the leading or featured category. But regardless of which category she slots into, no one is debating that this was a Tony-worthy performance as Cuban singer Omara Portuondo.', 'That tension you’re feeling is the symptom of just a 3.8 percentage-point gap between Conrad Ricamora (Oh, Mary!) and Francis Jue (Yellow Face). Oh, Mary! appears to be the more beloved production overall – projected to win five categories – so that might be enough to tip the scales in Ricamora’s favor.', 'Only Judith Light (Other Desert Cities, The Assembled Parties) has won featured actress in a play twice in a row. Kara Young, fresh off her win for Purlie Victorious, could be the second, but she’ll have to get past Jessica Hecht (Eureka Day) first.', ' It feels like this happens in so many years: The directors of the best musical and best musical revival frontrunners going head-to-head as the top two candidates in this category. Michael Arden (Maybe Happy Ending) holds a narrow 5.6 percentage-point lead over Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Boulevard).', 'Danya Taymor (John Proctor Is the Villain) could join Trevor Nunn, Jerry Zaks, Joe Mantello, and Jack O’Brien as the only people to win best direction of a musical and best direction of a play in consecutive years. But to accomplish that, she’ll need to take down the slight frontrunner, Sam Pinkleton (Oh, Mary!).', 'Boy does Death Becomes Her need a win for Paul Tazewell here. Otherwise, with no other categories it’s currently favored in, it risks becoming just the ninth show in Tony history to walk away with zero wins on ten or more nominations.', '', 'Holly Pierson (Oh, Mary!) does an excellent job threading the needle – apologies for the pun – between faithfully recreating 19th century styles and mirroring the inherent silliness of the show’s concept. None of these shows won a Drama Desk or an Outer Critics Circle honor for their costumes, so it’s a less informed prediction than most.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won seven Tonys, but this is the only category it won that its successor is also favored to win. The first time around, it was Andrew Bridge winning his second Tony, after a first for The Phantom of the Opera. This time, it’s lighting designer Jack Knowles looking to win his first.', 'This is the first of three consecutive play design categories that Stranger Things: The First Shadow holds the highest percentage on. And that’s actually underselling how honored this production might be, since it’s also due to receive a Special Tony Award for its illusions and technical effects.', 'In a category that typically nominates solo artists, Dane Laffrey and George Reeve (Maybe Happy Ending) are teaming up. Franne and Eugene Lee (Candide in 1974) are currently the only pair of individuals to share this award for a single musical.', 'The prior paragraph notwithstanding, 59 Productions breaks the dichotomy between individuals and duos. This design studio already has a win on the musical side from An American in Paris, and is now looking to notch its first victory for a play for Stranger Things: The First Shadow, in conjunction with four-time nominee Miriam Buether.', 'We now arrive at the single closest category of the year, according to my model. Just 0.8 percent separates Buena Vista Social Club and Sunset Boulevard for sound design of a musical. If you’re entering a Tony pool, you may as well flip a coin.', 'Paul Arditti’s nomination here for Stranger Things: The First Shadow marks the single most likely winner of any nominee in any category this year. Not sure if this is the category you expected to hear that stat in, but when the critics and the precursor awards are unanimous, that’s what happens.', 'In the order of this article, this marks the fifth projected win for Maybe Happy Ending. Should every prediction included here come true (a highly unlikely event), Maybe Happy Ending and Oh, Mary! would become the tenth pair of best musical/best play winners in the same season to each win 5+ Tonys. The most recent occurrence was The Band’s Visit and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.', 'It might feel like the same show always wins the trio of best musical, book, and score. But in recent years, that’s far from true: Kimberly Akimbo is the only show to pull off that trifecta since 2019. Maybe Happy Ending is now hoping to become the second in that timespan.', 'Jerry Mitchell has been widely praised for his choreography for Boop!, and could certainly conclude this awards season with a Tony. But, a key factor in the model is which other categories a show is nominated in, and only two other shows in the past 50 years (Swan Lake, Bandstand) managed to win this award without either a best musical or musical revival nomination.', '', 'I don’t know if the Tonys tipped their hand here or not, but Marco Paguia has technically already won a Tony for Buena Vista Social Club, as he and the rest of the band received a Special Tony Award this year. He’s got a 56.2 percent to add a competitive win to that trophy case.', '***', 'These blurbs alongside each chart cover but a small fraction of the talent from around the world involved in making this Broadway season happen. Perhaps the same could be said of the Tony telecast itself, which will surely be a delightful three hours that simultaneously leaves us craving more time at the theater.', 'Ben Zauzmer (@BensOscarMath) uses data to write about awards shows for The Hollywood Reporter.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHliRWRYV25FM1QycGZUbk5EVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdrQkVJRGpUQ0pyeHdF=-w280-h168-p-df

"Tony Talk: Dissecting those shocking wins for ‘Purpose,’ Nicole Scherzinger, Darren Criss, and full show analysis",https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/tony-talk-shocking-wins-purpose-nicole-scherzinger/,"['Welcome to Tony Talk, a column in which Gold Derby contributors Sam Eckmann and David Buchanan offer Tony Awards analysis. Mere hours after the 2025 Tonys, we reconvene to dissect the shocking wins, highlight our favorite victors, and discuss the musical performances.', ""David Buchanan: After a truly sensational Broadway season, last night's Tony Awards didn't disappoint with some surprises, did it? If folks have been reading our weekly column, they probably did pretty well with their predictions and would've seen some of these upsets coming — I shockingly tied for first place worldwide! — but there were still some wins that were hard to call correctly in the moment but were predictable in hindsight. One of those categories was Best Play. We knew that this would be a squeaker between frontrunner Oh, Mary! and challengers Purpose and John Proctor Is the Villain, but very few Gold Derby users correctly called the win for the Pulitzer victor. Do you think the fact that voters recognized performer and playwright Cole Escola with a Best Actor win led them to go with the drama with more gravitas for the top prize?"", '', '', 'Sam Eckmann: Congratulations on your top score! There were so many insanely close races last night, so picking the correct choice in each coin toss was tough. Part of the victory for Purpose came down to the strength of the entire Best Play field. Voters were fans of all of these plays, so a full sweep for Oh, Mary! wasn’t in the cards. The classic trope of wanting to reward a script that feels “important” helped push Purpose over the edge in the top race. Playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins is also the “it” writer of the moment in New York. Couple these points with the fact that Escola has a guaranteed win in Lead Actor, and it does make sense that a different production squeaked past Mary Todd Lincoln in the top race. Speaking of performers, I’m kicking myself for dropping Darren Criss at the last minute for Jonathan Groff in Lead Actor in a Musical. Clearly voters were head over heels for Maybe Happy Ending. Is it safe to say the overall enthusiasm for that musical is what tipped the scales for Criss?', ""SEE 'Every beat is meticulously crafted': An oral history of the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning play 'Purpose'"", '', '', ""Buchanan: I think so! In such an incredibly strong season for new musicals, it was not a guarantee that Maybe Happy Ending would sweep the pivotal categories of Director, Book, and Score on its way to its likely Best Musical victory. But once it started cleaning up during the ceremony, it would have been shocking if Criss — the sole acting nominee and thus the face of the show — ultimately lost. We both predicted Criss all season long, but The New York Times Tony voter survey led many folks astray by claiming Groff had the lead for playing Bobby Darin in Just in Time. He would have made for a great winner, as you can glimpse from the Tony performance last night just how high energy and charismatic he is throughout that show. But at the end of the day, Criss is also giving a strong performance in what is clearly a better-written musical. Do you think a similar dynamic tipped the scales for Nicole Scherzinger over Audra McDonald? I think most folks would say that Gypsy is one of if not the best musical of all time, but voters were clearly more taken by Jamie Lloyd's radical reinterpretation of Sunset Boulevard than George C. Wolfe's version of Gypsy."", 'Eckmann: I admit that I was definitely swayed for the first time (in the wrong direction) by the voter survey in The New York Times. It’s normally the best barometer for the Tony Awards, so the fact that it wasn’t totally accurate points to how fiercely close so many of these votes were. This was definitely the case in the McDonald-vs.-Scherzinger battle. I think that once again, the victory went to the performer in the production that was more popular with voters. McDonald was the only potential win for this revival of Gypsy, whereas Sunset Boulevard was strong enough to win Lighting Design and Musical Revival. Were there any other wins during the night that had you cheering? As a huge Purpose fan I’m sure you enjoyed Kara Young prevailing for the second year in a row.', 'SEE 2025 Tony Awards first-timers club: Half of this year’s acting winners triumphed for their Broadway debuts', 'Buchanan: Yes, the two wins for Purpose were by far my favorites of the night! I predicted Young, but it was by no means a guarantee that she would win in that incredible field which included Jessica Hecht and Fina Strazza. But there is just no denying that Young is a generational talent and so supremely kind and charismatic to boot, so it is absolutely fitting and thrilling that she is one of the very few performers to win back-to-back at the Tonys and the first Black performer to do so, too. I will remember her performance as Aziza and her growing disillusionment over her night with the Jasper family for a very long time. I\'m also delighted that Tony voters found a way to acknowledge Jacobs-Jenkins\' brilliant, Pulitzer-winning play and Cole Escola in the same ceremony. While I\'m sure Escola would have loved to win both prizes, I think the way they split the trophies — plus giving Oh, Mary! the directing prize for Sam Pinkleton — was very ""appropriate,"" Jacobs-Jenkins pun intended. As a champion of the show since its off-Broadway days, were the two Oh, Mary! wins your favorites of the night? And what were some of the snubs or complete shut-outs that stung the most?', '', '', 'Eckmann: I was so thrilled for Pinkleton! Oh, Mary! simply would not work the way it does without his guiding hand. In our current political moment, it’s truly powerful to see that this radically queer work of bizarre genius can be a financial smash on Broadway and win mainstream awards. I was similarly ecstatic for Francis Jue, who managed to win Featured Actor even though Yellow Face lost Play Revival. He was truly one of the breakout stars of the campaign trail, and this was a wonderful way to honor not only his moving performance, but also his incredible career in the theater. It’s hard to be mad at any of these wins because the season was just so strong. But I will continue to say that Real Women Have Curves should have been a Best Musical nominee. I wish there were more places for it to be rewarded last night. Alas, its only real shot was for Justina Machado, but Natalie Venetia Belcon has long had Featured Actress in a Musical sewn up. At least Real Women managed to secure a performance on the telecast, and I hope folks are inspired to buy tickets. The show has a gigantic heart that deserves to be celebrated. Speaking of performances, I think I was most moved by the host Cynthia Erivo and Sara Bareilles duetting on “Tomorrow” from Annie during the In Memoriam segment. The image of them holding each other as they looked back at the image of the late Gavin Creel had me at a puddle of tears, and reinforced the theme of community which seemed to dominate this telecast. In a world where we constantly analyze winners and losers of the industry’s biggest award, it was a needed reminder that everyone in attendance is truly a winner just for the opportunity to be in that room.', 'SEE 2025 Tony Awards: ‘Maybe Happy Ending’ dominates with 6 wins, Nicole Scherzinger shocks with Best Actress win over Audra McDonald', 'Buchanan: Beautifully said, and I agree seeing Bareilles\' reaction at the end of the In Memoriam was incredibly powerful! I also loved Harvey Fierstein\'s Lifetime Achievement Award speech on the Tony Awards: Act One telecast and his message that he feels like he accidentally fell into his exceptional career in the theater after finding his community while painting show posters as an adolescent. It is hard to have too many gripes about the winners this year, but I will confess that I am a bit heartbroken that three of my favorite productions from this sensational Broadway season — Dead Outlaw, Gypsy, and The Hills of California — all went home empty-handed. Victories for David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna in Best Score, Audra McDonald in Best Actress of a Musical, and Laura Donnelly for Best Actress in a Play, respectively, would\'ve made this Tony Awards an all-timer for me, personally. I am glad that Dead Outlaw, Gypsy, and the also-snubbed Just in Time acquitted themselves exceptionally well in their performances; I couldn\'t be more pleased that McDonald\'s otherworldly ""Rose\'s Turn"" has been recorded on video in an accessible form for posterity, and I\'m sure Sunset Boulevard fans feel exactly the same way about Scherzinger\'s moving ""As If We Never Said Goodbye."" While we\'re on the subject of Best Actress in a Musical again, you and I foreshadowed this year\'s exceptionally close contest exactly one year ago last June when we offered our extremely early 2025 Tony predictions; I can\'t wait to do that guesswork for the 2026 Tonys with you again any day now, so stay tuned, Broadway fans!', '', '', 'SIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions', 'Your email address will not be published.

13 standout looks from the Tony Awards 2025,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/style/tony-awards-2025-red-carpet,"['It may be off-season in Hollywood, but Broadway’s biggest names were on hand to deliver plenty of glamour at the 78th Annual Tony Awards.', 'Braving the rain, stars of the big stage arrived at New York’s historic Radio City Music Hall on Sunday in a series of silver, cream, ivory and champagne-colored embellished gowns, along with fittingly theatrical statement suiting.', 'US theater is having a moment: The 2024-25 Broadway season was the highest-grossing ($1.89 billion in revenue) and best-attended (14.7 million theatergoers) in history, according to the Broadway League. Theater’s boundaries with TV and film have also become increasingly porous, with George Clooney and “Succession” star Sarah Snook among this year’s high-profile Tony Award nominees.', 'The event’s red carpet has, in turn, become a major moment for stylists and fashion designers. Here are 13 standout looks.', 'Finally liberated from the emerald green of her “Wicked” method-dressing marathon, Cynthia Erivo looked resplendent in a champagne an embellished gown straight from Schiaparelli’s Spring 2025 couture runway. The standout feature was a dramatic yet delicately embroidered bodice that sat so far off-the-shoulder it appeared to float around her.', 'The British actor and singer did, thankfully, retain one element of her wicked witch era: delightfully long nails, which this time featured floral flourishes from nail technician Shea Osei.', 'Erivo went on to host the ceremony in an embroidered kimono by Saudi couturier Ashi Studio — but not before she performed the night’s opening number in a crystal-embroidered ruby gown by The Gap’s new high-end atelier, GapStudio.', '“Orange is the New Black” breakout star Danielle Brooks co-presented the ceremony this year, walking the red carpet in a mocha-hued haute couture dress by Stephane Rolland. The taffeta smock featured an embellished neckline and wide circular sleeves and was finished with a sculptural braided up-do by hair technician Tish Celestine.', 'Tony Awards co-presenter Sarah Paulson arrived at the ceremony in a haute couture Schiaparelli two-toned gown. The black velvet bodice featured a high-neckline and scooped at the hips before blooming into a buttery satin skirt embellished with sequins and embroidery. Daniel Roseberry, creative director of the French luxury house said he wanted the collection to be “baroque” and “extravagant,” when it was unveiled in January.', 'Paulson completed her look with Buccellati earrings and a slicked-back bun.', '“Oh, Mary!” star Cole Escola arrived in a powder blue dress (and curly wig) paying homage to Broadway legend Bernadette Peters.', 'Designed by up-and-coming US label Wiederhoeft, the gown’s low neckline, lace-up corset and glass-bead detailing evoked the iconic, medal-strewn look Peters wore to accept her Best Actress award at the 1999 Tonys (it was also her costume in “Annie Get Your Gun”). But there were several subtle differences, too — not least the halterneck, which framed a sheer panel showing off Escola’s well-groomed chest hair.', 'The first Asian American actor to be nominated for the Best Actor in a Play award, Daniel Dae Kim used the spotlight to celebrate his Korean roots. The “Lost” star put a modern spin on traditional Korean clothing in a “couture Hanbok” by LA-based brand, Meehee Hanbok (paired with black Christian Louboutin boots).', 'Like “Yellow Face,” the Broadway production for which Kim was nominated, the look offered a commentary on race in America. Speaking to Associated Press on the red carpet, the actor said he was making a “little statement,” adding: “Now that the definition of ‘American’ is under attack, I thought it would be nice to say that no matter what we look like or how we dress, we can all still be loyal and proud Americans.”', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nLook of the Week: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are still method dressing', 'Oscar winner Ariana DeBose returned to co-host the Tony Awards for the third time in a row, wearing a minimalist white silk slip dress and a tangled stack of layered pearl necklaces. She changed later into a black tailored skirt suit for a live performance of “Hamilton” tracks to celebrate the production’s 10th anniversary.', 'The Australian actor, who scooped best performance by an actress in a leading role in a play for her one-woman rendition of “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” marked the special occasion with a champagne-colored sequin gown by British designer Richard Quinn. The design featured a pooling, mermaid train and ‘80s-style shoulder padding.', 'On stage, the “Succession” star embodies 26 different characters over the course of the two-hour production. Snook had performed the play at London’s West End last year, where she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress. “The Picture of Dorian Gray” was her Broadway debut.', '“Rosemary’s Baby” star Mia Farrow was nominated for her first Tony Award for her performance in “The Roommate” alongside Patti LuPone. Farrow, who brought her son Ronan as her date, arrived in a monochromatic cream suit and matching chunky boots.', '“Hacks” star Jean Smart co-presented the Tony Awards in a custom Christian Siriano black floor-length gown which was draped at the waist. On-screen, Smart’s character Deborah Vance, a celebrated Las Vegas stand-up comic, is partial to a glitzy sequin bell-sleeved gown — but Smart’s own red carpet persona is much more refined, opting for monochromatic gowns and more structured silhouettes.', '“Dancing with the Stars” triple threat Julianne Hough also wore Christian Siriano — alongside eight other Tony attendees — on the red carpet.', 'Hough’s pristine ivory look featured a tulle mermaid skirt reminiscent of the kind worn by Marilyn Monroe, Diana Dors and Vera Ellen in the 1940s and ‘50s.', 'Acclaimed costume designer Paul Tazewell became the first Black man to win an Oscar for his profession. Now, just a few months later, he picked up a Tony Award for best costume design of in a musical for his work on “Death Becomes Her.” Tazewell is the second designer ever to win both landmark awards in the same year.', 'For the occasion he donned a Comme des Garçons iridescent frock coat complete with draped bows and McQueen slacks, along with chunky patent Givenchy boots. His arrow brooch, pinned to his lapel, was vintage and from New York-based jewelers Fred Leighton.', 'Known for his sharp and often-colorful red-carpet suiting, Leslie Odom Jr. opted for a more muted palette. With its subtle pinstripes and exaggerated proportions, his oversized three-piece toed a line between luxury tailoring and streetwear — a tightrope often walked by American label Fear of God, the American label behind the outfit..', 'The actor completed his look with a turtleneck and a pair of shades, before changing into all-black to perform with the original cast of “Hamilton” in celebration of the production’s 10th anniversary.', 'Julia Knitel was nominated for best performance by an actress in a featured role in a musical for her three different roles in “Dead Outlaw,” based on the true story of 20th century train-robber Elmer McCurdy.', 'For her first Tony nomination, and first time on the award ceremony’s red carpet, Knitel opted for a shimmering gold gown with a strapless neckline.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Every Single Thing That Happened at the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.vulture.com/article/tonys-2025-live-blog-updates-reactions.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'The 2024 and ’25 theater season came to a close not with a whimper but a bang, and by “bang” we of course mean Tony Awards host Cynthia Erivo belting her face off. The Antoinette Perry “Tony” Awards for Excellence in Broadway were held on June 8, celebrating the best in Broadway over the past year by handing out awards and featuring performances that will live on forever at gay guys’ YouTube nights. Seriously, Dreamgirls decided to just let Jennifer Holliday wail on “And I Am Telling You” over 40 years ago, and lives are still being changed to this day. And we got the sequel — Erivo’s “And I Am Telling You” parody that closed out the show — can be added to the rotation too. What we’re saying is that every part of the Tonys matters. They’re the one time of year that Broadway gets to commune with the rest of the country and say, “Hey, here’s what your local high schools are going to perform in five to ten years.” Below, everything that happened at the 2025 Tonys, as it was happening. —Jason P.

Broadway celebrates a spectacular season at the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5420804/tony-awards-2025-broadway-analysis-takeaways,"['By ', 'Jennifer Vanasco', 'Helen J Shen and Darren Criss in Maybe Happy Ending, which won the Tony Award for Best Musical.', ""The 78th Annual Tony Awards returned to Radio City Music Hall this year, with Cynthia Erivo hosting. Some years, one musical is crowned the absolute best of the season, sweeping almost all of the awards (think Hamilton). That didn't happen this time around, for good reason — Broadway had a banner year, with a tremendous diversity of shows. There were a lot of tight races (and a lot of gasps of surprise in the media room across the street, where I was stationed)."", 'The favorite, Maybe Happy Ending, an original musical about two lonely robots who find each other, won the most awards: six, including Best Musical.', 'Purpose, which won the Pulitzer this year, was named Best Play (one of the surprises — many theater-watchers predicted it would go to the buzzy queer farce Oh, Mary). But the show won only one other award, Best Featured Actress (Kara Young).', 'The rest of the awards, however, were really spread across shows. Buena Vista Social Club won four competitive awards, plus a special award for their musicians, while Sunset Boulevard won three, including Best Revival and Lead Actress in a Musical. Stranger Things: The First Shadow also won three competitive awards, all technical ones, plus a special award for Illusions & Technical Effects.', 'But this year, it felt appropriate that there was no sweep. It was a season of very diverse shows, and it deserved diverse winners.', 'Here are my top takeaways from a joyous Tony Awards.', '1.  Cynthia Erivo is funny. The producers used the comic timing of this year\'s host (and her miracle of a voice) to good effect. In one bit, she asked her friend Oprah Winfrey to look under her seat...where she found a toy red car. ""You get a car!"" Erivo crowed, to audience laughter. The show ended with her picking up a mic and singing, ""And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going"" from Dreamgirls.', ""2. Celebrities aren't everything, but they sure help with marketing. At the beginning of the season, there was a lot of talk about how New York's stages were flooded with celebrities, from Kit Connor to Denzel Washington to George Clooney to...well, it seemed like the whole cast of Succession."", 'Celebrities brought high, headline-making ticket prices, but they also brought a kind of excitement that you could feel in the streets before and after shows. They helped make Broadway feel culturally relevant again, with appearances on late night shows and podcasts. And many of them were presenters, which made the show feel a bit like the Oscars (Keanu Reeves, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston and Ben Stiller among them).', ""But what they didn't do was dominate the awards. There are eight acting awards and only three were won by celebs: Nicole Scherzinger won for Best Leading Actress in a Revival for Sunset Blvd., beating out Audra McDonald, Darren Criss won Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Maybe Happy Ending, and Sarah Snook for Best Leading Actress in a Play for The Picture of Dorian Gray."", '3. Hamilton can still elicit a standing ovation. It\'s been 10 years since Hamilton debuted on Broadway, and to celebrate, the original cast did a ""mixtape"" performance. There were no corsets in sight; instead, they wore all black and highlighted some of the musical\'s greatest hits, ending with Christopher Jackson singing ""History Has Its Eyes On You.""', '4. Diversity was rewarded. Not just in the DEI sense (though there were plenty of awards that went to racially-diverse actors and productions, like Buena Vista Social Club, set in an ethnically specific milieu), but also in the types of productions showcased this season. There was something for everyone: Stranger Things is based on the sci-fi horror hit series from Netflix; Operation Mincemeat is a scrappy musical about World War II that originated in England; Dead Outlaw used country rock to tell a story about a corpse.', 'Over and over, people on the red carpet told me this was a season that held a show for all types of people, and that they hope producers see that new, risky productions are viable moneymakers – and belong on Broadway.', '5. Gavin Creel is deeply missed. The Tony-winning actor died in September at age 48 of a rare cancer. Erivo and Sara Bareilles sang a slow, lovely version of ""Tomorrow"" from Annie during the In Memoriam segment honoring those on the boards and behind the scenes who died this season. The last photo was of Creel and after, Erivo and Bareilles shared a long hug.', ""The American Theatre Wing is partnering with a group of Creel's friends to build a $3 million endowment to support young theater makers in his honor."", 'Edited by Ciera Crawford', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHliRWRYV25FM1QycGZUbk5EVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdrQkVJRGpUQ0pyeHdF=-w280-h168-p-df

Celebrities in Christian Siriano for the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.redcarpet-fashionawards.com/2025/06/09/celebrities-in-christian-siriano-for-the-2025-tony-awards/,"['JUNE 9, 2025', 'On Sunday, the 2025 Tony Awards lit up New York City’s Radio City Music Hall in celebration of live Broadway theatre—and one designer ruled the red carpet like a true stage veteran. Christian Siriano dressed six stars for the occasion: Natalie Venetia Belcon, Darren Criss, Audra McDonald, Kristin Chenoweth, Jean Smart, and Justina Machado. With everything from lavender feathers to ombré tuxedos, Siriano gave us a front-row seat to fashion that felt as dramatic and theatrical as the performances being honoured.', 'We are starting off strong with Natalie Venetia Belcon, who had a night for the history books. Not only did she win for her performance as Omara in the new musical Buena Vista Social Club, but she also looked absolutely breathtaking in a custom Christian Siriano lavender feather cape gown. If this isn’t the marriage of Broadway theatricality and red carpet glam, I don’t know what is. The drama, the colour, the regal presence—this is what I want from the Tony Awards every year. Easily a standout, and she wore it like a queen taking her bow.', 'This was a night of firsts for Darren Criss. His first nomination. His first win—for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical for Maybe Happy Ending. And he became the first Asian American actor to win in that category. That’s a lot of firsts—and yet, it’s not the first time Darren’s turned heads on the red carpet. His custom Christian Siriano metallic ombré flare tuxedo was a knockout: part disco, part dapper, and fully fabulous. It oozed retro charm and proved once again that Darren has a sharp eye for fashion.', 'Audra McDonald, nominee and performer, gave us a red carpet moment worthy of her legendary status. Her custom Christian Siriano liquid sequin gown, topped with a purple satin overlay, served sculptural drama and regal finesse. The shimmering texture caught the light beautifully, and the overlay added that grand, almost operatic silhouette. A pitch-perfect choice for someone whose presence always commands a standing ovation.', 'Kristin Chenoweth brought her signature sparkle to the carpet in a cobalt blue corset chiffon dress by Christian Siriano. It was playful, it was flirty, and yes—it might lean a little “twee” for some, but it’s so on-brand for Kristin. The matching sandals were a sweet touch, and the whole look felt like a modern fairytale. This is her fashion comfort zone, and she owned it.', 'Jean Smart may have opted for simplicity in her custom Christian Siriano bias-draped gown, but the impact was anything but minimal. The way it hugged and flowed, the understated elegance—it was a masterclass in refined glamour. In fact, this was my second favorite look of the night after Natalie’s. There’s something about the ease of the drape and the quiet confidence of the styling that made it unforgettable.', 'Justina Machado wore a Christian Siriano black velvet off-the-shoulder gown with a high slit that was full of drama and Old Hollywood allure. However, the sheer opera gloves embellished with jewels undercut the sleek sophistication of the look for me. Without the excess sparkle, this could have been a cleaner, more impactful statement. Still, the dress itself was a strong and sultry Siriano signature.', 'Christian Siriano give us theatre-worthy fashion moments for the most theatrical night of the year.', 'FTC Disclaimer: Keep in mind that I may receive commissions when you click links and make purchases.

Best and Worst Moments From the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/theater/tonys-best-worst-moments.html,"['Tony Awards', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '', 'There was a “Hamilton” reunion, Nicole Scherzinger’s outsize grandeur and Cynthia Erivo’s pleasant “sing-off” music. But those cheesy projections were a big miss.', 'By The New York Times', 'It was plugged before what seemed like every commercial break, but when members of the original cast of “Hamilton” finally gathered onstage at Radio City Music Hall for a 10th-anniversary reunion performance, the hype proved justified. Sleekly lit and dressed and choreographed, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Leslie Odom Jr. were gloriously back; so were Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones and that Tony-nominated guy who played King George. The eight-song medley — which included “My Shot,” “The Schuyler Sisters” and “The Room Where It Happens”— snapped. I’d make room for it on any list of all-time-best Tonys performances.', '— Scott Heller', 'The smooth baritone, the sly half-smile and the wink at the camera. This guy had to be an actor. And, once upon a time, he was. But Gary Edwin Robinson received a Tony Award last night for his second career, as a teacher, at Boys and Girls High School in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Accepting the honor in that voice that could make you believe anything, he said that he trained his students not merely to appreciate theater, but to find careers in it. Appreciation is of course valuable, but the harder thing is to instill in young people the idea that finding “the theater in themselves” can be honorable, and even necessary.', '— Jesse Green', 'Nicole Scherzinger’s acceptance speech was as epically demonstrative as her movements in “Sunset Boulevard” are controlled, restrained, precise. The acknowledging of “the exceptional warrior women in this category”! The shaking! The crying! The swooping motions from the hand that was not holding her new award! At times it felt like seeing a modern Maria Callas shaking her fist at the heavens, except that for once those heavens had ruled in her favor. There was an outsize grandeur to the drama of it all that felt classical. Can Medea be far off?', '— Elisabeth Vincentelli', 'ADVERTISEMENT']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHliRWRYV25FM1QycGZUbk5EVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdrQkVJRGpUQ0pyeHdF=-w280-h168-p-df

', 'Indeed, tonight’s event, hosted by Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo—who nabbed a Tony win herself in 2016 for The Color Purple—has some of the world’s best stage talent gathered into the same categories. ', 'After all, this Broadway season has been highest grossing on record, earning a whopping $1.83 billion in ticket sales for shows like George Clooney’s Good Night and Good Luck and Sadie Sink’s John Proctor Is the Villain And yes, both of those screen-turned-stage actors are nominated in the acting categories this evening.', 'As for other shows that add to the evening’s competitive edge?

Who Will Win the 2025 Tony Awards?,https://www.vulture.com/article/tony-awards-predictions-2025.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'After a thrillingly packed Broadway season and an awards campaign that has involved more petitions than I ever expected, the Tonys are coming up on Sunday night. There’s a lot to unpack this year with the incursion of Hollywood stars and franchises onto the Great White Way alongside the rise of some local theater darlings. There are races with obvious favorites as well as races in which the consensus is so fragile it could be tousled by a gust of wind. Which is to say, as always, that all our predictions are 100 percent accurate and you should bet all your money on our advice; then you can go invest it in a musical, famously also a guaranteed way to make money.', 'Best Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club\nDead Outlaw\nDeath Becomes Her\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical', 'It has been a really good year for new musicals! I can pretty much imagine any of these shows beating the crop from last year (sorry, sad wet hunks of The Outsiders). But at this point, the race favors Maybe Happy Ending. While Dead Outlaw is a critics’ favorite — I love its dusty wit — I know more than a few people who (wrongly) found it hard to connect with. Death Becomes Her has the industrial support of its producer Universal, solid sales, and all those TikToks based on its line deliveries, but it’s likely a little down-the-middle to edge in. Maybe Happy Ending has the praise, the Cinderella box-office story, and the emotional sentiment baked into its robot love story to make voters connect with it.', 'Best Play\nEnglish\nThe Hills of California\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain\nOh, Mary!\nPurpose', 'I’ve found it fascinating to watch Oh, Mary! — a box-office hit that has dominated conversations in New York and been a Tony front-runner for a whole season — do sort of an underdog campaign for Best Play. A deranged queer comedy is not your typical winner, but there’s a lot of Mary enthusiasm and, considering Betty Gilpin’s and Tituss Burgess’s runs as Mary, proof that the show can go on with or without its creator, Cole Escola (imagine the stars of all genders who could actress out in it on tour). But there’s a case to be made that Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s family drama Purpose, which has picked up steam after a Pulitzer win, is more meat-and-potatoes Tony fare. There’s maybe an outside chance for the finely honed John Proctor Is the Villain, about teenage girls in Georgia confronting The Crucible. But Oh, Mary! somehow seems like the safe choice.', 'Best Revival of a Musical\nFloyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Blvd.', 'Jamie Lloyd’s Sunset revival cut out the original’s vowels, the sets, and a lot of the costumes from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s lumbering musical, then added a bunch of screens and a ferocious Nicole Scherzinger. His amendments aren’t universally loved but they’re striking, and with a revival, it’s often about how much you can see the work done on evolving the original piece. Enough was done here to make it a likely winner. The show’s main rival is Gypsy, though its director, George C. Wolfe, wasn’t nominated for his work on the musical, which may indicate voters are cooler on it as a whole.', 'Best Revival of a Play\nEureka Day\nRomeo + Juliet\nThornton Wilder’s Our Town\nYellow Face', 'The front-runner here is the most recent: Jonathan Spector’s dark comedy about a progressive California school debating its vaccination policies had an Off Broadway production in 2019, which means Manhattan Theatre Club’s version this spring qualifies as a revival. The play was well received, and voting for it gives the Tonys a chance to make a political statement, especially considering RFK Jr.’s appointment as HHS secretary. The other revivals don’t quite have that grip, though Yellow Face was excellent, and Romeo + Juliet has staged a rather bitchy campaign involving the dictionary definition of revival.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\nDarren Criss — Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand — Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis — Sunset Blvd.\nJonathan Groff — Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart — A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical\nJeremy Jordan — Floyd Collins', 'There are six nominees in this category instead of the typical five thanks to an arcane rule about ties in the nomination voting process, but that’s just the beginning of the goofiness: Tom Francis’s campaign has involved getting into soda reviews, Andrew Durand stood in a coffin in random places in New York, and Darren Criss has emphasized the physical transformation of playing a robot. Meanwhile, Jonathan Groff is on The Tonight Show talking about getting into leather. So while Criss has a decent shot — and I wish Jeremy Jordan had gotten more attention for singing Collins’s gorgeous score — Groff has the momentum. Even though he won last year for Merrily We Roll Along, his whole show hangs on his personal fascination with mid-century crooner Bobby Darin, and somehow it’s both compelling and a hit.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\nMegan Hilty — Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald — Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers — Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger — Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard — Death Becomes Her', 'Everyone’s favorite category is even more of a nail-biter than usual! Ever since Sunset and Gypsy were announced for the same season, we’ve been speculating about the race between Nicole (who won the Olivier in London) and Audra (who is six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald), and the race between them has fluctuated all season (remember the business about Russell Brand and the red hat?). Right now, momentum may be breaking toward McDonald. She just picked up a Drama Desk Award, and getting a broadside from Patti LuPone has given the community a reason to rally behind her.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\nGeorge Clooney — Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola — Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill — Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim — Yellow Face\nHarry Lennix — Purpose\nLouis McCartney — Stranger Things, The First Shadow', 'Sure, George Clooney, you can sell 3 million bucks worth of tickets to a Broadway show in a week, but can you pull off a madcap medley in a billowing black dress? Cole Escola’s a hometown hero who has been hard at work downtown for years and is finally getting deserved adulation. I believe and hope they’ll win.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\nLaura Donnelly — The Hills of California\nMia Farrow — The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson — Purpose\nSadie Sink — John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Sarah Snook’s performance in Dorian Gray shows the work in a way awards-show voters love to reward: She plays every character, and with the help of a dedicated film crew, performs to recorded versions of herself. Nobody else nominated gets that much business to do onstage, though Laura Donnelly’s double act as mother and daughter in a part tailor-made for her was impressive, Sadie Sink made a striking TV-to-theater turn, and it’s great to see how much fun Mia Farrow is having on the campaign trail.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\nBrooks Ashmanskas — SMASH\nJeb Brown — Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein — Gypsy\nJak Malone — Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical\nTaylor Trensch — Floyd Collins', 'Jak Malone has become the focal point of the campaign for Mincemeat, a British comedy about a wild bit of World War II history. The show dominated the West End but has gotten a cooler reception here (Americans like to turn up their noses at humor from across the pond), though Malone delivers its standout number in the first act from the perspective of a stoic secretary, which feels like something voters will reward. Still, keep an eye out for Danny Burstein, who has won before and is as menschy as ever in Gypsy.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\nNatalie Venetia Belcon — Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel — Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence — Just in Time\nJustina Machado — Real Women Have Curves: The Musical\nJoy Woods — Gypsy', 'Buena Vista is another show that popped up in a lot of categories but seems most likely to make headway for a featured performance. The musical based on the Cuban supergroup is getting a special Tony for its band, and it feels as though voters will also want to reward Natalie Venetia Belcon, who is imperial and striking as a diva who weathered the revolution and is pulled back into the recording studio (my God, her caftans!).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play\nGlenn Davis — Purpose\nGabriel Ebert — John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue — Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk — Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora — Oh, Mary!', 'If we’re betting on Mary elsewhere, some of that shine must apply to her serious, very repressed husband, played by Conrad Ricamora, a Broadway vet who almost convinces you the show is a gay breakup drama. There’s also enthusiasm for Francis Jue, incredible as a version of Yellow Face playwright David Henry Hwang’s father (a part he has played before!). There’s also Glenn Davis, who multitasks by being in Purpose and co–artistic directing Steppenwolf, and Bob Odenkirk, though his production of Glengarry was shafted elsewhere.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play\nTala Ashe — English\nJessica Hecht — Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat — English\nFina Strazza — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young — Purpose', 'How does Jessica Hecht not have a Tony? A stage regular with two previous nominations, she may finally get one for playing Eureka Day’s crunchy-granola vaccine skeptic of a mother. But maybe I’ll regret betting against Kara Young, who plays an interloper in the family drama of Purpose and, after winning for Purlie last year, continues a streak of four Featured Actress nominations in a row.', 'Best Direction of a Musical\nSaheem Ali — Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden — Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer — Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli — Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd — Sunset Blvd.', 'It gets fun when the Revival and New Musical categories combine. Voters have to measure their enthusiasm for new work against their appreciation for what was renovated in older work. Or, simply: Do people like the screens in Maybe Happy Ending or Sunset Blvd. more? I’m guessing they go for Jamie Lloyd, who has become a marquee name with a distinctive-tats and star-forward approach (he’s doing a Bill & Ted Waiting for Godot next) and hasn’t yet won a Tony. But there could be more than enough love for Michael Arden, who has championed Maybe Happy and quickly become a Broadway regular (he’s got two shows next season), even if he recently won for Parade.', 'Best Direction of a Play\nKnud Adams — English\nSam Mendes — The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton — Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Are we just putting all our chips on Oh, Mary!? I guess so. Phylicia Rashad, who directed its Best Play rival Purpose, wasn’t nominated in the Director category. Kip Williams’s work on Dorian Gray is striking, though it has its detractors — people love Sarah Snook but have mixed feelings about Williams’s social-media-infused take on Wilde. Danya Taymor, an expert in dramas about high-school drama, just won last year for The Outsiders, and Sam Mendes’s and Knud Adams’s shows have already closed. Oh, Mary!’s outrageous farce runs with incredible precision, and that’s all Sam Pinkleton.', 'Best Book of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw — Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her — Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts', 'It’s hard to tell if we’re in a year like 2017, when The Band’s Visit won basically everything, or a year like the last one, when voters went for more variety. (Then Suffs won for its book and score, while The Outsiders got the big prize). My feeling is this category and the one below will split. Maybe Happy Ending’s jewel-box construction will put it over the edge here …', 'Best Original Score\nDead Outlaw — David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her — Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves: The Musical — Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', '… But Dead Outlaw’s garage-band rock may give it an edge as a score. (Never bet against David Yazbek.) My perspective is, yes, informed by listening on repeat to Thom Sesma’s hilarious solo from the perspective of a crooning coroner. And to do due diligence, maybe Tony voters have been inundated by so many clips of Death Becomes Her songs online they will be subliminally made to vote for it — but unlike me, I think they are blissfully unaware of TikTok.', 'Best Orchestrations\nJust in Time — Andrew Resnick and Michael Thurber\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson\nFloyd Collins — Bruce Coughlin\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Paguia\nSunset Blvd. — David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber', 'Okay, first of all, justice for the un-nominated Dead Outlaw orchestration. And second, what a wild group: Bobby Darin arrangements up against Collins’s bluegrass up against Maybe Happy Ending’s lovely chamber jazz up against Sir ALW’s face-lift on his own work. After a lot of listening, those MHE jazz arrangements stand out to me (such distinctive melodies in the strings!), but I could see enthusiasm for the neo-gothic Sunset or this being a place where voters want to further endorse the music of Buena Vista.', 'Best Choreography\nSMASH — Joshua Bergasse\nGypsy — Camille A. Brown\nDeath Becomes Her — Christopher Gattelli\nBoop! The Musical — Jerry Mitchell\nBuena Vista Social Club — Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck', 'Buena Vista may get another down-ballot win here given that Justin Peck is such a name as a choreographer (though known for ballet, he has won two Tonys already for Carousel and Illinoise) and there’s a fun narrative in his working with his wife. But hey, the kerfuffle over Boop! not getting a slot to perform on live TV may mean the Tony could go to Boop!', 'Best Scenic Design in a Musical\nSwept Away — Rachel Hauck\nMaybe Happy Ending — Dane Laffrey and George Reeve\nBuena Vista Social Club — Arnulfo Maldonado\nDeath Becomes Her — Derek McLane\nJust in Time — Derek McLane', 'In Seoul, where the musical originated, Maybe Happy Ending was performed in a far more minimal way than its American incarnation, which incorporates elaborate design elements to bring two robots (and one beloved potted plant) to life. That feels eye-catching enough to bring it a win here, though voters might also have been dazzled by Swept Away’s coupe de shipwreck or Death Becomes Her’s tumble-ready staircase.', 'Best Costume Design in a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Dede Ayite\nBoop! The Musical — Gregg Barnes\nMaybe Happy Ending — Clint Ramos\nDeath Becomes Her — Paul Tazewell\nJust in Time — Catherine Zuber', 'Paul Tazewell, who just won an Oscar for costume design on the film adaptation of Wicked, is primed to get another Tony (after a win for design for Hamilton) for those striking Death Becomes Her gowns that mimic the characters’ injuries. But I do love the lightly futuristic yet cozy aesthetics of Clint Ramos’s robotwear in Maybe Happy, which could continue a streak here, and voters may have Gregg Barnes’s half brightly colored and half black-and-white designs for Boop!’s Act Two opener seared into their retinas.', 'Best Lighting Design in a Musical\nSunset Blvd. — Jack Knowles\nBuena Vista Social Club — Tyler Micoleau\nFloyd Collins — Scott Zielinski and Ruey Horng Sun\nMaybe Happy Ending — Ben Stanton\nDeath Becomes Her — Justin Townsend', 'In craft categories, there’s an incentive to vote for what you remember, and voters may just have a strong sense memory of being “out there in the dark” of Jack Knowles’s work on Sunset. They could also remember the trickery of the illusions in Death Becomes Her or the darkness of Floyd’s cave or just continue along with love for Maybe Happy Ending (there’s a scene with fireflies that’s lit gorgeously).', 'Best Sound Design of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Jonathan Deans\nSunset Blvd. — Adam Fisher\nJust in Time — Peter Hylenski\nMaybe Happy Ending — Peter Hylenski\nFloyd Collins — Dan Moses Schreier', 'Sunset’s much-discussed Act Two opener sends Tom Francis tromping down the street, performing in sync with the orchestra. That’s the kind of attention grabber voters remember, even if I’ve heard some carping about the concert-level speaker-blowout design of Sunset. The rest all do sound impressively crisp, and if the love for the Buena Vista band really is stronger, that could be a spoiler.', 'Best Scenic Design in a Play\nEnglish — Marsha Ginsberg\nThe Hills of California — Rob Howell\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Marg Horwell and David Bergman\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Miriam Buether and 59 Productions\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Scott Pask', 'I would personally like to announce that I thought the Stranger Things scares were neither good nor spooky, but yeah, there are a lot and they pretty much occupy the show’s entire focus. Stranger Things is already getting a special citation for its illusions and technical effects, but that wouldn’t stop voters from expressing further enthusiasm for the designs here. If not, there’s the screenwork of Dorian Gray or the old-fashioned “Let’s actually construct a whole space” designs of Good Night, and Good Luck and Hills of California.', 'Best Costume Design in a Play\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Brenda Abbandandolo\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Marg Horwell\nThe Hills of California — Rob Howell\nOh, Mary! — Holly Pierson\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Brigitte Reiffenstuel', 'That hoopskirt is pretty much an above-the-title star, and don’t get me started on the Chaperone’s elaborate costumes. Unconventional as Oh, Mary! is as a Tony favorite, I see no reason for the love not to continue here — though, sure, Dorian supplies Sarah Snook with many personae via costume, Good Night evokes the ’60s via precision suiting, and I guess a Demogorgon suit is a costume?', 'Best Lighting Design in a Play\nThe Hills of California — Natasha Chivers\nStranger Things: The First Shadow — Jon Clark\nGood Night, and Good Luck — Heather Gilbert and David Bengali\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain — Natasha Katz and Hannah Wasileski\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray — Nick Schlieper', 'Ooo ooohhh, the demon’s gonna get ya.

The best and worst moments from the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2025/06/09/best-worst-tony-awards-moments-2025/,"['Top honors went to daring Broadway shows that took big swings, while solo performances lit up the telecast.', 'Ingenuity and reinvention won big at the Tony Awards, where host Cynthia Erivo heralded the big headline of the night: “Broadway is officially back!” This season’s high-flying box-office numbers were juiced by an influx of Hollywood star vehicles, but the biggest artistic honors went to outside-the-box shows that gambled on big risks.', '“Maybe Happy Ending,” a jewel-box musical about obsolete robots who fall in love on a road trip, took the coveted best musical prize and awards for creators Will Aronson and Hue Park, director Michael Arden, and its leading android Darren Criss, the first known Asian American to win best actor.', 'Cole Escola’s “Oh, Mary!,” a madcap comedy imagining Mary Todd Lincoln as a boozehound wannabe cabaret star, remains one of the season’s biggest success stories, despite missing out on the best play prize to “Purpose,” Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s roiling and incisive drama about a power couple of the civil rights movement. Escola won the best actor trophy for playing Mary Todd while dressed in homage to Bernadette Peters, a nod to the YouTube clips that made Escola an alt-comedy darling.', '“Eureka Day,” a prescient satire written before the pandemic about parents debating immunization, was crowned best play revival. Producer Manhattan Theatre Club pulled the production from a planned run at the Kennedy Center this spring, a move that may have underlined its relevance to voters.', 'Follow Theater', 'Nicole Scherzinger topped the nail-biting contest for best actress in a musical for “Sunset Blvd.,” which also won best musical revival, a category that tends to reward bold, imaginative swings like director Jamie Lloyd’s. (Audra McDonald still gave a shattering performance from “Gypsy.”) And Sarah Snook of “Succession” won the other big actress prize, for her head-spinning turn as every character in “The Picture of Dorian Gray.” Alongside other first-time winners, a pair of unsung Broadway vets finally got their due: Francis Jue, for “Yellow Face,” and Natalie Venetia Belcon for “Buena Vista Social Club.”', 'Erivo had jokes. Production numbers popped off the screen. And awards were spread among shows that dreamed big. Here are the best and worst moments from the night.', 'Audra! Nicole! Jonathan! Next to winning, wowing TV audiences with a high-impact number can be a big box-office boon on Broadway, even for shows that aren’t nominated. Solo performances from the season’s most charismatic stars won the telecast. Erivo announced Jonathan Groff’s “Just in Time” number from the balcony, with jokes about the actor’s famous splash zone. He’s a spitter, a schvitzer and totally electric as Bobby Darin in the jukebox biomusical. (He also straddled the back of Keanu Reeves’s chair.) Tony winner Nicole Scherzinger’s full-throated take on “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” a five-alarm 11 o’clock number from “Sunset Blvd.,” was filmed like a high-gloss fragrance ad, with copious fog and close-ups that may light up the box office for the home stretch of the revival, which closes July 20. And Audra McDonald left everything on the stage with a wrenching “Rose’s Turn” that a new generation of “Gypsy” fans (and show-tune gays) will absolutely be poring over on YouTube.', 'Of all awards shows, the Tonys really oughta open with a bang. Or at least a burst of razzle-dazzle. Cameos from Oprah Winfrey and Adam Lambert couldn’t save the curtain-up number, which followed Erivo backstage (in a nod to a bit from “Sunset Blvd.”) where everyone had ideas for how the show should start. “Sometimes all you need is a song” was Erivo’s answer, and she tore up the vocals with backing from a gospel ensemble. But the nominees tucked into the lyrics came and went almost as quickly as the AI-looking projections. Erivo’s closing number, a riff on “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” on the other hand, was the perfect mic drop.', 'I’m in the minority as one of few theater professionals who hasn’t committed the “Hamilton” score to memory, but the 10th anniversary number was a slick and resounding reminder of why Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Obama-era juggernaut maintains such a hold on the culture. It was a delight to see the original cast reunite, considering their careers have soared to such great heights. Rarely does a Broadway production explode into such a phenomenon and birth so many bona fide stars. Hopefully it inspires more creators to keep swinging big.', 'It was a cute idea in theory, but cutting off victors’ remarks is always an awkward proposition. Why get Erivo involved, even in recorded voice-over? Fortunately, this gimmick eventually went the way of the many deceased characters onstage this season.', 'A hometown hero from D.C.’s Takoma neighborhood, Jacobs-Jenkins brought home his second Tony in two years, winning best play for “Purpose.” (He won best revival last year, with “Appropriate.”) He joins the ranks of Tony Kushner and Terrence McNally as the third playwright to win Tonys in consecutive years, cementing his place as a defining voice of this fraught, slippery moment in American history. “My obligation is to write to people living in reality with me in the present,” he told me earlier this spring. He used the Tonys stage to call out the richness of regional theater, encouraging viewers to Google “local theater near me.” Of course, D.C. theatergoers already know.', 'The Style section', 'Broadway is expensive to make, most investors lose their shirts and everyone still crazy enough to chip in deserve all their flowers. But last year’s pivot to corralling the stampede of producers on-screen but offstage felt cleaner and more civilized. With the camera panning across their sea of faces, who knew where to look?', 'McDonald’s record as the most Tony-nominated (and winningest) performer spans more than three decades. But the past few years have minted a fresh crop of repeat Tony winners. Michael Arden, who was honored for his delicate direction of the whimsical and futuristic “Maybe Happy Ending,” previously won for his 2023 revival of “Parade” (which will play the Kennedy Center on tour in August). Kara Young has been nominated for four years in a row (!) for best featured actress, and has won back-to-back, with “Purlie Victorious” and now “Purpose,” which also minted Jacobs-Jenkins as a two-time Tony winner in two years. These are the artists helping to power the industry through a major rebound with their devotion to the craft.', 'If you didn’t make it over to Pluto TV for the awards handed out before the prime-time telecast, we saw designers, book writers, composers and other offstage talent accept honors with early-evening giddiness. Hue Park, one of the night’s big winners with “Maybe Happy Ending” co-creator Will Aronson, clarified that he’s “very much single.” Costume designer Paul Tazewell won for “Death Becomes Her” the same year he nabbed an Oscar for “Wicked.” Harvey Fierstein welled up accepting a lifetime achievement award, and Sara Bareilles and Celia Keenan-Bolger grew emotional remembering the late Gavin Creel, who died in September. Accepting an award for her humanitarian work, Keenan-Bolger announced the Gavin Creel Fellowships, grants of $25,000 and mentorship opportunities to aspiring actors.', 'The Tonys are always held during New York’s Pride Month, but shout-outs to the cause felt especially celebratory and defiant. Jak Malone, accepting a featured-actor award for “Operation Mincemeat,” said audiences who’ve fallen for his gender-fluid performance “might have just bid farewell to cynicism, to outdated ideas, to that rotten old binary” and opened themselves up to “a world that is out there in glorious Technicolor and isn’t going away anytime soon.” Performing “For the Gaze,” her homonym-fueled opening number from “Death Becomes Her,” Megan Hilty gave us everything we want: Liza, Judy and a fringy capelet in colors that said “trans rights.” A very happy Pride to that.', 'A caption in a previous version of this article incorrectly identified the person pictured as Will Aronson.
