""You guys are too good.""', 'Just less than a year later, those two teams are back in the Stanley Cup Final, a rematch between the champion Panthers and the runner-up Oilers that begins with Game 1 at Rogers Place in Edmonton on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET; CBC, TVAS, SN, TNT, truTV, MAX).', ""It wasn't just something Tkachuk said, not a platitude."", '""I believed that it was going to be us two again,"" Tkachuk said. ""I think we\'re the two best teams in the League. And if everything would go right, it would probably be us two again in the Finals. I have that confidence in our team and they were the best team that we played last year in the playoffs. I stand by that. I believed it at the time. And here we are again.""', ""It's an experience the Panthers can use. The Oilers too."", '""You think about it all summer,"" Tkachuk said. ""You think about this moment of getting back with a chance to compete for the Stanley Cup again. And we\'re the two lucky teams that get to do it. I mean it\'s so hard, too, and very few players are able to get a chance at one, even, so if you would have asked both of us in the middle of the summer if we have a chance to play for the Stanley Cup again, a rematch, we would both race to sign that paper.', '""It\'s here. They\'re an unbelievable team. It\'s going to be a great battle. They\'re, I\'m sure, champing at the bit to get another chance at it.""', ""Though there are a lot of similarities between the teams that faced off last season, it's not entirely the same. And there's no guarantee the outcome will be either."", '""I think from a personnel standpoint, I think there are some new pieces and some key pieces on each team that weren\'t there last year,"" Tkachuk said. ""… It is a rematch, and there\'s a lot of similar faces, but there\'s some fresh blood on both sides that are going to be very hungry and going to be difference-makers in this series.""', 'It was something Florida coach Paul Maurice noted, too, that both teams are better than they were last season, better in ways specific to what the teams needed to improve upon. And they have.', '""I\'m going to say that both teams are deeper this year,"" Maurice said. ""So, that\'s a change for them, for us. I think they are further along in their defensive structure and we\'re actually a little further along in our offensive structure. And when you look at the strengths clearly last year, you\'d say their offensive game was elite. They put up eight on us one night, so they can score some goals, but our defensive structure\'s pretty good too.', '""Those were our strengths and then we just added to what might have been perceived as our weaknesses. We\'ve gotten better at those, so both teams are better. Both teams are deeper. Both teams I think have made improvements on what would be their weaknesses, but they\'ve maintained their core strength in doing so.""', 'FLA vs. EDM', 'FLA vs. CAR | EDM vs. DAL', 'FLA vs. TOR | CAR vs. WSH | DAL vs. WPG | EDM vs. VGK', 'OTT vs. TOR | FLA vs. TBL | MTL vs. WSH | NJD vs. CAR', 'STL vs. WPG | COL vs. DAL | MIN vs. VGK | EDM vs. LAK', 'Tkachuk will play his third straight Cup Final with the Panthers, having won one of the previous two. He has been an All-Star and helped bring Florida Panthers hockey to the top of the NHL. He has played international hockey and become a star.', 'He is still just 27 years old.', '""I\'m just super lucky, I think,"" said Tkachuk, who has 16 points (five goals, 11 assists) in 17 playoff games this season, including two goals and five assists in the five-game Eastern Conference Final win against the Carolina Hurricanes. ""I feel like I\'m not even halfway through my career and I\'ve been fortunate enough with so many great things that have happened and been blessed.', '""I think my life changed, obviously, when I got traded here and everything\'s just been -- it was incredible before when I was playing in Calgary, and it\'s just been a whole different beast down here with things that have happened. Hoping to check another box here in a few weeks.""', 'Though the Panthers have been in Florida this week since securing their return to the Cup Final, they were able to do something that was especially meaningful to Tkachuk. The inaugural Gaudreau Family 5K Walk/Run and Family Day was at Washington Lake Park in Sewell, New Jersey, on Saturday, honoring the lives of Johnny Gaudreau and Matthew Gaudreau, who died Aug. 29, 2024, when they were struck by an alleged drunk driver who was charged with two counts of death by auto, while riding bicycles near their home in Salem County.', ""Brady Tkachuk was able to be there in person, but Matthew, who was Johnny's teammate with the Calgary Flames for six seasons, was not. Yet with the early end to the conference final, the Panthers gathered to walk a 5K from Florida, supporting the family from afar."", '""This kind of just happened, really last second, because we were planning on potentially being in Carolina for a Game 7 today or whenever it was,"" Tkachuk said. ""I know that once we won the second round, the girls and the families were talking about potentially doing something on the day to raise money and honor the Gaudreau brothers. Once we won in five, we were able to partake.""', 'They all did.', '""Everybody was out there, which I thought was amazing,"" Tkachuk said. ""I got to walk around Holiday Park [in Fort Lauderdale], got to raise some money for the foundation and just to honor them, I think is really special. And it means a lot to me and [Sam Bennett] and guys that played with him and knew him. Very special and I know they\'re very appreciative.

Both teams looked dominant during the playoffs, and are now set to square off for the ultimate prize once again."", ""It's not too often that there's a Stanley Cup Final rematch in consecutive seasons. In fact, the last time it happened was in 2008 and 2009 when the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins met in back-to-back matchups in the final. They ultimately split the series, with Detroit winning the Cup in '08 and Pittsburgh in '09."", ""There's plenty at stake in this year's matchup. Florida has now reached the Stanley Cup Final in three straight seasons and will look to win it all for just the second time in franchise history. Meanwhile, Edmonton hasn't lifted the Cup since 1990, and the tandem of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl are more than overdue for a championship."", ""With all that in mind, we're going to take a look at the history between the Oilers and Panthers, including their head-to-head record this season and all-time, as well as Stanley Cup Final matchups between the two sides."", 'The Oilers and Panthers only faced each other twice during the regular season, and Florida came away with the victory on both occasions.

Edmonton has a record of 26–22–3 against Florida all-time."", 'The 2024 Stanley Cup Final was the first and only time these two teams met in the playoffs. That series started off miserably for Edmonton, who quickly found themselves staring up at a 3–0 deficit. They rebounded, however, evening the series at three wins apiece before losing a heartbreaking Game 7, 2–1.', 'Despite being on the losing end of the series, Connor McDavid took home the Conn Smythe trophy as the best performer in the playoffs. That postseason, he led the league with 42 points in 25 games, including 34 assists.', ""The Oilers have won five Stanley Cups in franchise history, but, like the rest of the NHL teams from Canada, are mired in a long drought without a title. Edmonton's last championship came all the way back in 1990."", ""The Oilers had a dynastic run during the 1980s and early 1990s, winning the Stanley Cup five times in a seven-year span from 1984 to 1990. They defeated the New York Islanders in '84, the Philadelphia Flyers in '85 and '87, and the Boston Bruins in '88 and again in '90."", ""Including 2025, Edmonton has only been back to the Stanley Cup Final three times since its last championship.

It\'s that \'us against the world\' mindset, but you especially feel it being down in a series,"" Tkachuk said. ""Your back\'s not necessarily against the wall, but you treat it as a big-time, must-win [game] in a hostile environment. I feel like that\'s when we\'re at our best. So, hopefully we can use that to our advantage.""', ""This Stanley Cup Final rematch is already feeling different than last season's, which saw the Panthers build a 3-0 series lead. While defending champion Florida believes it has improved since last season, Tkachuk noted that this was a different Oilers team than the one the Panthers defeated in seven games."", '""I think everybody saw last night, including us, they are a very, very, very good team. They have some dangerous players. Even when their top guys are playing together, they have other lines that can play. That hasn\'t always been the case there,"" he said. ""They defend hard, block shots, their goalie\'s playing well. They\'re better. We\'re better. I think it\'s going to be a great series.""', ""One point of concern for the Panthers after Game 1 was how they squandered a two-goal lead over the Oilers, who rallied to tie the score in the third before Leon Draisaitl's overtime goal ended it. Florida had been 31-0 under head coach Paul Maurice in the playoffs when leading after the first period or the second period in a game."", '""We went through some video and saw the things we can do better through the neutral zone. Maybe a little bit more offensive zone time,"" said defenseman Seth Jones. ""But they played a good game. They were solid defensively. They blocked a lot of shots. We knew that coming in that there\'s not a lot of space out there, not a lot of plays to be made, really. So when we do get those opportunities, we have to try to hold on to the puck and capitalize.""', 'Tkachuk said the Panthers could be more consistent on the forecheck and earn more zone time to keep the Oilers from counterattacking.', '""We did some really good things that we\'re going to just have to do for longer stretches of time tomorrow,"" Tkachuk said. ""They definitely finished better than we did in the game and probably earned that win. They dictated more of the game than we did. It is what it is. Back to the drawing board. Just try to play better than them tomorrow.""', 'Game 2 is scheduled for Friday night in Edmonton. The winner of Game 1 in a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final has won the series 76% of the time.

But there are plenty of talking points off the ice too', 'T\nhis time last year the story of the Stanley Cup final between Florida and Edmonton was mostly about Connor McDavid, hockey’s generational talent, getting the chance to bring the Cup back to hockey’s generational home. And it almost went his way, after the Oilers overcame a three-game deficit to force a deciding Game 7. Instead, McDavid’s win came a little later. His series-winning goal against the US in February’s Four Nations Cup amid the febrile nationalism created by Donald Trump’s annexation threats and tariffs seemed to quiet the doubters about where hockey both belonged and who rightly owned its highest honours. But here we are again, on the eve of the final, with Edmonton facing Florida for the second season in a row – Game 1 is on Wednesday night – and with a team from that state contending for the Cup for the sixth straight year.', 'The easiest way to explain why the Tampa Bay Lightning (2020-22) and Florida Panthers (2023-25) have each reached the Stanley Cup final as Eastern Conference champions in three consecutive seasons is that, well, they have both been very good teams. You can point to some common elements between the two, like scoring depth, a certain level of tenacity and grit, elite Russian goaltending, and Carter Verhaeghe. But there has also been something less obvious or quantifiable about these teams. Some characteristic that they share, beyond the on-ice talent and performance. It may be Florida itself.', 'There’s the income tax rate, for one thing, in that there isn’t one. Given that, the common refrain goes, Florida teams have an inherent advantage when free agents are looking for a new place to play. Indeed, Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois confirmed it last summer, telling reporters that Florida’s “favourable tax situation” had helped entice players to sign. The Associated Press ran the numbers on Sam Reinhart’s new deal at $8.625m per year. In Florida, he will owe $3.15m in annual taxes – $1.1m less than if he lived in California, and $1.4m less than if he was in Toronto. Then again, there are no state income taxes in Tennessee, either, and Nashville finished third-last in the NHL last year. None in Texas, either. No Cups there recently. Nor in Washington. So, maybe there’s more to it – less bureaucratic and more geographic reasons, like the beach and the weather. Or it could be the vibe.', '“Nothing in Florida is ever quite what it seems,” former Tampa Bay Tribune reporter Craig Pittman wrote in his book about the state, adding that “in Florida, the crimes tend to be weirder and the scams bigger.” Florida is where all the “nation’s unctuous elements tend to trickle down as if [it] were the grease trap under America’s George Foreman grill,” Kent Russell wrote in the New York Times. Both writers made those assessments in the summer of 2016. Since then, Florida has had quite the decade. And even for what was already America’s strangest state, it’s been an interesting few years. Much of that is due to Donald Trump’s ascension to the US presidency – twice – not in his original big-suited, big-dealing New York City tycoon form, but as something much weirder, angrier, and noticeably more sunkissed: that is, as a kind of alpha Florida Man.', 'Of course, all of that might have had little or nothing to do with hockey had it not been for Trump’s personal vendetta against Canada this year, all but vowing to annex it as the 51st state. Or if Wayne Gretzky wasn’t such a staunch Trump supporter – a fact that has made him persona non grata in the country he once led to Olympic gold. Or if Gary Bettman (and Gretzky) hadn’t been hanging out with Trump-nominated FBI director Kash Patel at Capitals games. Or if a Panthers minority owner hadn’t called a Toronto Maple Leafs supporter an “51st anti semite loser” on X last month. But all that stuff did happen, both setting and capturing the tone of the season, hounded at every turn by a Florida Man. To no small degree, it would make an Oilers win all the more satisfying for many Canadians.', 'Still, even if none of that off-ice stuff had happened, there is still undeniably a high level of that brash, unapologetic, and moderately crazed Florida attitude in the Panthers. They might not all be men from Florida, but they sure feel like Florida Men. It’s by sheer coincidence that the Panthers’ spirit animal is not the team’s namesake cat but is instead a rat. But let’s be honest, it fits with how many see the team (and not just because Brad “the rat” Marchand plays there now – that’s just fate). Because, as much as you might respect the rat’s hustle or its capacity to survive against long odds – as the Panthers did during their 2023 Cup run, beating the seemingly unbeatable Boston Bruins in the first round – most of the time you want them to go away for ever.', 'Yet, the life of a rat is also a story of a certain kind of success. It’s no easy feat to find your way when everyone hates you. Still harder to do it more than once. “Part of Florida’s appeal is that it’s the Land of a Thousand Chances, the place where people go who have screwed up elsewhere and need to start over,” Pittman wrote. He was thinking of guys like Carlo Ponzi, creator of the Ponzi scheme. But you could just as easily point to someone like Verhaeghe, who spent six years in the AHL and ECHL after being drafted before the Lightning and Panthers gave him a chance. Now he’s a two-time Cup winner.', 'Connor McDavid and the Oilers have a second chance in Florida now, too. Another opportunity to make the rats go away. Of course, that won’t be easy. The Panthers are relentlessly tenacious, with an aggressive offensive pinch. They’re gritty, some may even say dirty. And they’ve proven that they can scrape and scramble to the top. Just like the state they call home.', 'This article was amended on 5 June 2025 to clarify that Game 1 of this year’s Stanley Cup final was played in Edmonton.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNDVSV1JKUTBjelZqUkZkM2N4VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZQk1JZ3JxUVU=-w280-h168-p-df

Let’s dig right in as we savor Game 1 on Wednesday in the northwest:', '▪ “Is it true some nincompoop Miami columnist referred to McDavid as “McOverrated” in last year’s Final?”', 'Yes, I did! (Who uses the word nincompoop anymore?) And guess what? The unkind nickname is even more of a snug fit now.', 'McOverrated does not mean McDavid isn’t great. He is. He has won three Hart (MVP) trophies, led the league in points five times. His combo of speed and stick-handling might be unmatched.', 'But enough with the McJesus, next-Gretzky hyberbole. He isn’t perfect. Nothing special defensively. Prone to turning the puck over. Oh, and this minor thing: NO CHAMPIONSHIPS. Zero Stanley Cups in his 10th NHL season. Tick-tock, Connor. Not sure about you Canadians, but here in the States we sort of a put a premium on winning it all. (It’s why Dan Marino never really entered the greatest-QB-ever talk even though he shattered NFL passing records. Never won a Super Bowl.)', 'Similarly, unless he triumphs during the next two or three weeks, the hole in McJesus’ resume’ and legacy will remain a crater. Without a Stanley Cup win...', 'McOverrated.', '▪ “What is it about a championship rematch?”', 'Think Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Or Evander Holyfeld-Mike Tyson. The first fight was so grand, a curtain call was demanded. Same in team sports.', 'Florida won its first Stanley Cup last year in epic fashion, in a taut Game 7 — the Cats finally earning a first franchise Cup, Edmonton denied its first since ever-distant 1990, and McDavid denied ... again. Rematch? Yes, please!', 'More than that, title rematches in major team sports are such rare treats.', 'This is the 12th in NHL history (the reigning champ is 7-4 on winning again), but only the fifth since the start of the expansion era in 1967-68. The previous was Detroit Red Wings-Pittsburgh Penguins in 2008-09.', 'Title rematches are a bit more common in the NBA, but the NFL hasn’t had a Super Bowl rematch since Buffalo Bills-Dallas Cowboys in 1992-93. And MLB last had a World Series repeat since Los Angeles Dodgers-New York Yankees in 1977-78.', 'Rare, too: Teams winning back-to-back vs. the same opponent, the Panthers’ aim now. It has been done only three times since 1978, by Golden State Warriors over Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017-18, Chicago Bulls over Utah Jazz in 1997-98, and Cowboys over Bills in ‘92-93.', '▪ “Why does this feel so big for South Florida sports?”', 'Tectonic plates are shifting, in both the NHL and the South Florida market. These things happen so gradually sometimes you don’t even feel them.', 'The NHL’s final four cities included Dallas, Raleigh, North Carolina, and, with Florida, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale. The South, rising. Hockey, rising in places where an ice cube wouldn’t last a minute on the asphalt out front.', 'The league’s Original Six teams (Montreal, Toronto, Boston, Detroit, Chicago and New York) watch as the nontraditional cities take what was theirs. A team from Canada, which invented hockey, last won a Stanley Cup in 1993. (More pressure on Edmonton, and on McDavid to play national savior.)', 'In South Florida, the shift of tectonic plates sees the evolution and rise of a sport both played on ice and played in the tropics. Not saying this will ever be a “hockey town” (football won’t budge), but it has gotten closer, fast, than previously thought possible.', 'Three straight Stanley Cup Finals can do that. And the year before that run the Cats won the Presidents’ Trophy for best regular-season record. That’s four straight years of excellence.', 'The natural comparison is to the Miami Heat’s Big 3 era of LeBron James that produced four straight NBA Finals and a pair of championships from 2011 to 2014.', 'I would not forget the Miami Dolphins’ magical run in 1971-74, which included three straight Super Bowls, two championships (one a Perfect Season) and a four-year record of 55-10-1.', 'The Panthers are doing that kind of thing right now. We are in it, in the midst of history being made.', '▪ “Why is this Panthers team special beyond the wins and success?”', 'Another team in town makes a trademark of “Heat Culture,” talks about it all the time. That was the team that had its recent season sabotaged when its star player quit on everybody and pouted his way into a trade. That team got swept out of the playoffs’ first round by losing four straight games by a combined 122 points.', 'The Panthers lead the league in chemistry, in harmony, in joy, in all of the things you want to scoff at until you see them working.', 'Third-year coach Paul Maurice: “I’ve had more fun and learned more about life and hockey in the last three years from these players. It’s been life-altering. I try to choose my words carefully. It’s been life-altering.”', 'General manager Bill Zito, on captain Aleksander Barkov and camaraderie: “Sasha has almost become like a planet, with the energy that comes from him. How caring he is as a human and a teammate -- he forces you to want to be better. It cannot be overstated the grace of each of our guys. If you came into the meal room you wouldn’t know who just scored the winning goal and who didn’t play.”', 'Barkov and goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky are quiet as church mice. Matthew Tkachuk and Brad Marchand chirp like crows on a wire. The mix of talent and personalities is something you want to bottle, and preserve.', '▪ “So who’s going to win the Stanley Cup Final?”', 'The betting odds are ever-so-tight. DraftKings lists the Panthers a narrow favorite at -115 to Edmonton’s -105. You can also find sportsbooks that have the Oilers a slight favorite.', 'Edmonton has (most might say, if only by rote) the best player in this series in McDavid. But Florida has the superior depth across all four lines, as evidenced by an NHL-high 18 different players with at least one goal scored this postseason.', 'The Panthers (it says here) have the better goalie in Bobrovsky.', 'Intangibles might be even.', 'Edmonton unquestionably has what only they can: The revenge factor. The want to end their city’s 35-year Cup drought and win for all of Canada. And the (mostly unspoken) desire to get that giant ice-monkey off McDavid’s back.', 'Florida has in its pocket both the ability to claim the confidence of a reigning champion that has won 11 of its past 12 playoff series and also the right to play the underdog card. After all, the Final will be the fourth consecutive playoff series that the Cats have not had home-ice advantage. Yet here they are.', 'The winner? Panthers in seven. Again.', 'Sorry, Connor.

For Florida, captain Aleksander Barkov and goalie Sergei Bobrovsky received four votes each.', 'Here is how they picked:', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 9-5', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: This is a tough pick. But as good as the Panthers have looked over the first three rounds, as smart and as dogged and as true to their style as they’ve played, I just think revenge will carry the Oilers past. They were devastated when they brought the Cup Final back to Game 7 last season, narrowly losing by one goal, and they came back hungry and ready. With Stuart Skinner looking like he can hold the fort in goal and McDavid and Draisaitl working their magic, I think it’s finally time for the game’s best player to get over the hump and get his Cup. Much like the Panthers did after losing the Cup Final to the Vegas Golden Knights in 2023 and coming back to win it last season, I think the Oilers are going to be ready to prove themselves and their mettle. It’s their year.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Leon Draisaitl, Oilers', '', '', '', '', 'EDM@DAL, Gm5: Oilers earn second straight Clarence S. Campbell Bowl', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: You can’t say enough about either team finding its way through this grind to return to the Cup Final. I would have liked the Oilers’ chances more with a healthy Zach Hyman, given how physical he was until his injury; that would have suited this series especially well against the Panthers. But adding Brad Marchand to what was already a team designed to play at this time of year would prove to be too much for Edmonton. And as well as Skinner has responded in goal for the Oilers since the first round, I have to give the edge here to Sergei Bobrovsky.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: The Panthers can keep up with the Oilers offensively, and they’re tighter defensively. They’re more physical and better in goal. Hyman is a huge loss for Edmonton. The forward, out for the series with an upper-body injury, leads the playoffs with 111 hits. The Oilers have 648 hits in 16 games this postseason, while the Panthers lead the playoffs with 812 hits in 17 games. As well as Skinner has played lately in goal, Bobrovsky still has the edge. Since reclaiming the net May 10, Skinner has gone 6-2 with a 1.73 goals-against average, .931 save percentage and three shutouts for Edmonton. Over the same period, Bobrovsky has gone 7-2 with a 1.34 GAA, .944 save percentage and two shutouts for Florida. The Panthers will repeat.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'FLA@CAR, Gm5: Panthers win third straight Prince of Wales Trophy', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', 'WHY: It’s hard to go against McDavid, the best player in the world, but I think Florida has a resilience and all-business approach that will serve it well in the Final rematch. The addition of Seth Jones from the Chicago Blackhawks has made the Panthers defense bigger, more mobile and added scoring punch. Adding Marchand from the Boston Bruins has given Florida more scoring depth and another pest to put on the ice against McDavid and Co., along with All Star agitator Matthew Tkachuk. Skinner has been very good in goal lately for the Oilers, but the edge goes to Bobrovsky, who has elevated his game in each series. Still, defeating Edmonton won’t be easy. But then it wasn’t last year, either.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: Edmonton has been working toward this Stanley Cup Final rematch since losing to Florida in seven games last season and is better prepared for it this time. After appearing outmatched in losing the first three games, the Oilers found their footing in Game 4 and nearly came back to win the series before falling short in a 2-1 loss in Game 7. Learning from that experience, they won’t be on their heels to start this series and shouldn’t have to climb out of an 0-3 hole again. McDavid is driven to win the Cup for the first time and will finish the job.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', '', '', '', '', ""EDM@DAL, Gm5: McDavid extends Oilers' lead in 2nd period"", 'Conference finals record: 0-2', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: There are so many reasons to believe in Edmonton right now: the extra motivation from last year’s Stanley Cup Final Game 7 loss; its scoring depth and even-strength play this postseason (outscoring opponents 42-26 at 5-on-5); its best player, McDavid, riding the momentum from his 4 Nations Face-Off championship-winning goal with Canada in pursuit of the Stanley Cup; the return of defenseman Mattias Ekholm in front of an already dominant Skinner. But the way the Oilers have rallied in many games this postseason and dismantled three deep, structured teams so far gives them a real chance to take down the ferocious Panthers. I’m going back to my preseason Cup pick because Edmonton has shown it can win in every which way.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 0-2', 'Overall record: 7-7', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', ""WHY: The Panthers and Oilers are different than when they met in the Final a year ago, but one thing that feels similar is Florida's dominance. The Panthers are just built for the Stanley Cup Playoff grind, and that's why I think they'll repeat as Cup champs. They're deeper up front with the way they've gotten production from the third line of Marchand, Anton Lundell and Eetu Luostarinen. And the addition of Jones and the growth of Niko Mikkola gives them a better top-four defense than they had a year ago. And I know the Oilers are better defensively than a year ago -- and the way they limited the Dallas Stars to 17 shots on the road in an elimination game Thursday was impressive -- but I have a tough time trusting Skinner in a big spot. Florida didn't celebrate after eliminating the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final; the Panthers know the only party that matters will be the one they have after they win the Cup again."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'The guys discuss the Florida Panthers advancing to their third straight Stanley Cup', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', 'WHY: Full disclosure: I had the Panthers repeating as champion and Barkov winning the Conn Smythe Trophy from the outset of the playoffs, but have been more impressed by what the Oilers have been able to achieve this postseason. Still, no reason to change my prediction now, particularly since Florida has the look of a team primed to win a second straight Stanley Cup after adding critical pieces up front (Marchand) and on defense (Jones). The Panthers officially become a dynasty after winning this series that I believe will go the distance so long as Bobrovsky remains healthy.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Panthers in 7', ""WHY: OK, I’m really torn on this one. I was tempted to just flip a coin and go from there. I believe the Oilers are stronger coming into this Stanley Cup Final than they were last year and were dominant in the Western Conference Final against the Stars. But there’s something about the Panthers that just amazes me and convinces me they're going to win a second straight Stanley Cup. This is their third consecutive season in the Final. Logic tells you they should be physically broken at this point, given the amount of hockey they’ve played the past three seasons, yet they keep on going and going. This is going to be one heck of a Cup Final; I just think Florida takes it again."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 10-4', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: Here is what we know. This will go seven games, because, why not? We also know McDavid will win the Conn Smythe for a second straight season because he’s the best player on the planet. The question is will he win the Conn Smythe and the Stanley Cup, or will he be the MVP on the losing side again? I say yes to the first part of that question. Sure, the Panthers defeated the Oilers last season, but there is no question Edmonton is much better equipped for Florida and the Final this season. First of all, the Oilers will have home ice, unlike last year, and secondly, they know what type of game the Panthers play. Now losing forward Zach Hyman to injury is huge and you do wonder if Skinner can keep playing at his current level, but there should be no doubting McDavid and Edmonton this time around. It won’t be easy and I would not be shocked if Florida wins it again, but this feels like it’s McDavid’s time to finally hoist the Cup.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', '', '', '', '', 'The guys discuss the Oilers advancing in a win over the Stars', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', 'WHY: To be the man, you have to beat the man, as Ric Flair said more than once in his illustrious wrestling career. Florida is still the man. It proved it on this playoff run. In the second round, the Panthers were down 2-0 in the series to the Toronto Maple Leafs and were losing Game 3. Yet, they rallied, winning four of five in that series and four of five against the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final. That’s .800 hockey during their past 10 games. With the additions of Marchand and Jones they are arguably better than the team that jumped to a 3-0 series lead against the Oilers before stumbling home in seven last year. It will be entertaining, it will be fierce, it will be riveting, but in the end, it will end as it did last season. Florida will still be the man.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Aleksander Barkov, Panthers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 8-6', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: The answer here is simple. It’s because the Oilers touched the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl. Duh. Of course. Reverse the curse, right? They didn’t touch it last year and lost in seven to the Panthers. So touch it this year and they win it. Simple math, really. But in all seriousness, it’s because they remind me a lot of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009, when they won the Stanley Cup against the Detroit Red Wings after losing to them in the Stanley Cup Final in 2008. It’s the old live and learn, get a second crack at the same opponent, and be better for it. Edmonton is still led by McDavid and Draisaitl, just like Pittsburgh was by Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But like the Penguins in 2009, the Oilers are better all around their generational stars. They will not be intimidated by the moment. They will not be overwhelmed. They will not lose the first three games like they did last year. They’re rolling and they have home ice this time. Edmonton will be the city of champions again. Lock it in.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 9-5', 'PICK: Panthers in 6', ""WHY: This one could go either way, but for me, it will come down to depth and Florida is just a deeper team up and down the lineup. When your stars aren't producing, you need the depth players to. With 21 of 22 skaters who have played at least one playoff game scoring a point and 19 of them having at least one goal, what more can you ask for? And when all else fails, they have future Hall of Famer Bobrovsky in net to bail them out."", 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Sergei Bobrovsky, Panthers', '', '', '', '', 'NHL Tonight on the Panthers advancing to the Stanley Cup Final', 'Conference finals record: 1-1', 'Overall record: 12-2', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: It’s not plagiarism when you copy and paste yourself, which I do here from last season (just adding one year) because the sentiments still hold: It has been 32 years this spring since Canada loaned the Stanley Cup to the United States and it’s time that the 1892 gift to this country from then-Governor General Lord Stanley of Preston came home. From Barkov to Bobrovsky, Florida is a fabulous team. But I want to see McDavid, arguably the greatest player in hockey today, press the Stanley Cup overhead and watch Edmonton, back in its dynasty 1980s known as the City of Champions, lose its mind in celebration. To a full generation of Canadians, the Stanley Cup has been only a rumor. Nothing scientific about this pick, but it’s time that fantasy became reality.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 2-0', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 6', 'WHY: I find it difficult to imagine McDavid and Draisaitl being defeated in the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive season. The two superstars are healthy and have taken their game to another level. They also have a stronger, more experienced supporting cast than they had a year ago. Once healthy, the Oilers rolled through the Western Conference, winning four straight to dispatch the Los Angeles Kings and eliminating the Golden Knights and Stars in five games each. Edmonton is rolling and getting contributions up and down the lineup. The Oilers have been waiting an entire year for this opportunity, and I can’t see them being denied. McDavid and Draisaitl will be the difference in the series and bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'Conference finals record: 2-0', 'Overall record: 11-3', 'PICK: Oilers in 7', 'WHY: Are the Panthers a better team than the one that beat the Oilers 2-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final a year ago? Yes, thanks to adding Marchand and Jones in the second half of the season. But so, too, are the Oilers, a point Stars coach Pete DeBoer emphasized after his team was eliminated by Edmonton on Thursday. According to DeBoer, the Oilers play a much tighter, playoff-friendly defensive structure than they did last year, adding that they also have better depth. The fact they have home ice advantage should it come down to another Game 7 is huge, given the raucous nature at Rogers Place and, for that matter, the entire city. But the main reason I’m selecting Edmonton? The Oilers were my preseason pick to win the Cup nine months ago. The proof is on the web. Let’s see if they can prove me right. This much is certain: It won’t be easy.', 'CONN SMYTHE WINNER: Connor McDavid, Oilers', 'FLA vs. EDM', 'FLA vs. CAR | EDM vs. DAL', 'FLA vs. TOR | CAR vs. WSH | DAL vs. WPG | EDM vs. VGK', 'OTT vs. TOR | FLA vs. TBL | MTL vs. WSH | NJD vs. CAR', 'STL vs. WPG | COL vs. DAL | MIN vs. VGK | EDM vs. LAK']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNDVSV1JKUTBjelZqUkZkM2N4VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZQk1JZ3JxUVU=-w280-h168-p-df

However, the Oilers dominated from the third period on, outshooting their opponents 24-8.', 'McDavid also had an assist on Mattias Ekholm’s game-tying marker, and Viktor Arvidsson scored for the Oilers.

The play came together when Jake Walman teed up a shot from the point that bounced off Bobrovsky. After two of his two teammates whiffed on the loose puck, Draisaitl, who was on the floor just moments before, got off the deck to punch in the goal.', 'It was a physical game from the onset. Evander Kane checked Aaron Ekblad from behind against the boards, and Carter Verhaeghe also got in on some of the action early on.', 'Corey Perry was penalized for high-sticking Gustav Forsling, which put Florida on its first power play of the game. However, the Oilers killed off the penalty and completely neutralized their offense.', 'Bennett tied the game with 9:09 left in the first when he redirected a shot from Verhaeghe that went by Skinner, who fell to the ice after getting hit by Bennett. The Oilers challenged the goal due to goaltender interference, but they were overruled when the officials determined Jake Walman tripped Bennett into Skinner and ruled it a good goal.', 'The Panthers took a 2-1 lead on the very next play when Nate Schmidt fed Marchand in the right circle, and the former Stanley Cup champion blasted it by an outstretched Skinner.', 'Second Period', 'Bennett scored his second of the night two minutes into the second period when Tkachuk carried the puck past the blue line and shoveled a pass to Bennett, who snapped it over Skinner’s blocker to make it a 3-1 game.', 'One minute and 17 seconds later, the Oilers responded when Arvidsson took a drop pass from Podkolzkin and blistered a slap shot that snuck just under Bobrovsky’s glove to put them within a goal.', 'Skinner was locked in from this point forward and made some critical saves to keep the Oilers in the game, including a shot from Verhaeghe that ricocheted off his blocker, and Skinner was able to shovel to his right, and snag the rebound, to boot.

Kasperi Kapanen set up the play and found McDavid deep in the offensive zone before driving the puck to the net from the right door and shoveling a backhand pass to Ekholm.', 'Kane had a massive opportunity to give Edmonton the lead when he tried to backhand a rebound from the slot, but his shot just went wide of the net and Bobrovsky was eventually able to cover up the puck. However, after the whistle, Aaron Ekblad gave Kane a couple of shoves, which were reciprocated. Officials had to separate the two, and Ekblad was escorted to the Panthers bench. However, both men escaped without taking a penalty.', 'The Oilers were operating with a head of steam in the final period. With five minutes remaining, Edmonton had outshot Florida 11-2.', 'Overtime', 'Skinner made a gorgeous save just over five minutes into the overtime frame when he made a glove save as Aleksander Barkov pulled off a driveby screen. However, Skinner’s incredible concentration allowed him to pull off the save anyway.', 'With 12:51 remaining, Kapanen split three defenders and fired a quick shot that hit the post.', 'Following Thomas Nosek’s penalty for delay of game after shooting the puck over the glass, the Oilers gave their hometown fans a reason to erupt into a frenzy.

Especially on the power play, you’re looking to finish it,” Draisaitl told reporters. “Again, some incredible plays that made it pretty easy for me to put that home. It’s a special feeling. It’s great for right now but we got to look ahead and get read for Game 2.”', 'McDavid, the three-time Hart Memorial Trophy winner, called his teammate Draisaitl “invaluable” to the team.', '“Does so many good things,” McDavid said. “Clutch, face-offs, you name it, he does it.

What the Lightning can learn from the Oilers’ Game 1 win,https://www.rawcharge.com/what-the-lightning-can-learn-from-the-edmonton-oilers-game-1-win-stanley-cup-final-florida-panthers/,"['', 'The Tampa Bay Lightning are no longer in the playoffs. That doesn’t mean we can’t keep talking about them, right? So, along the same lines of the eternal How Does this affect the Leafs? we present a recap from the perspective of what the Lightning pull from both teams in regards to the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 overtime win against the Florida Panthers in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final.', 'If you didn’t watch, well, first off, congratulations on getting a full night’s sleep. For a playoff season that was surprisingly lacking in lengthy overtime contests, it seemed like the game was heading for a second overtime before Leon Draisaitl slammed home his second goal of the game with 31 seconds left in the first bonus frame.', 'The goal sent the home fans into a state of euphoria and gave the Oilers a much needed 1-0 lead in the series. Had they lost this game after blowing a 1-0 lead, and then fighting back from a 3-1 deficit, it would have been a demoralizing loss for the Western Conference Champions.', 'Edmonton’s game-opening goal was a good lesson in how to beat the Panthers. For the Lightning, the lesson is – if you want to get one past Sergei Bobrovsky, get a shot on net and then crash it.', 'Jake Walman flung a shot from the boards that was tipped by Kasperi Kapanen. Bobrovsky made the initial save, because that’s what he’s been doing all post-season. The play was made by Evander Kane Leroy Jenkins-ing his way through the crease. It screened the goaltender a bit, but more importantly, it kept Gustav Forsling from being able to come out and block off Draisaitl.', 'Florida has spent the entire playoff season owning the front of the net. Edmonton got inside of that protection and made them pay. They also didn’t rest on their success either as they pushed the play (and physicality – more on that later). Of course, Florida did their Florida thing. Their confidence level is off of the charts.', 'Therein lies lesson number two – don’t get out of your game plan if things go a little haywire early. The Panthers withstood the pressure and tied the game up. They have the “been there, done that” swagger and have been able to assert their style of play on their opponents no matter what the score of the game is. The Lightning had that swagger during the Cup runs, and its slipped a little over the last few years. They’ve allowed their opponents to dictate the pace of the game.', 'In typical Panthers’ fashion the goal came with a little physical contact and a little controversy. A shot from the slot by old friend Carter Verhaeghe beat Stu Skinner, but Sam Bennett was all up in his crease.', 'Goaltender interference, right? Nope, thanks to Brett Kulak tripping Bennett, which caused the contact. One failed challenge later and Florida made it 2-1 with a power play goal. Things really started to look bleak when Bennett scored his second of the night early in the second period. The mojo for the Oilers was officially gone, and the crowd was taken out of it.', 'Florida has been so very good at changing the pace of the game in the second period throughout the playoffs. It was especially noticeable against the Carolina Hurricanes. There were a few games in that series where Carolina put together really good starts, but then faded in the middle frame as Florida stuck to their system and ground the game to a halt.', 'After putting up 11 scoring chances and 14 shots on goal in the first period, Edmonton only had 6 scoring chances and 8 shots, with most of those coming late in the period. The good news is that on one of their few shots on Bob, they put it past him. What was nice about this play is the speed and efficiency Edmonton had in getting it out of the zone. They didn’t dally or circle it behind the net to regroup. Tampa Bay did that a lot in the opening round series, and it just gave Florida a chance to set things up in the neutral zone.', 'A team can’t stop skating against Florida. To do so invites their forecheck, and usually leads to some chaos. Florida got to that game as the period progressed, but Edmonton didn’t wilt. In fact, they kept doing what they had been doing most of the game, which was matching Florida hit for hit. Both teams ended the night with 51 hits, and there were a few moments where it looked like the Panthers started to anticipate hits and rushed to get rid of the puck.', 'Edmonton tied things up with Mattias Ekholm’s third-period goal. The two teams battled for the last 14 minutes of regulation and then 18 minutes of overtime. With just over two minutes to go in the first overtime, Tomas Nosek flipped a puck into the crowd to earn a delay of game penalty. Part of the reason he did it was because an Oiler was bearing down on him. Nosek rushed the play and made a mistake. Edmonton ended it a shifts later.', 'Perhaps that’s the most important lesson for the Lightning – teams don’t like to get hit. Even if they are the big, bad Panthers. If you can establish a physical presence early and often, it can lead to mistakes later in the game, or later in the series. That doesn’t mean they need to go out and get a bunch of guys that run amok trying to hit everything in sight, but a tough forecheck, and timely physical play can create chances that lead to goals.', 'Edmonton did what they couldn’t do early in last year’s Stanley Cup Final, which was to win a game in which they dominated play. Bobrovsky was the difference last year in Games 1-3. Maybe it was the rust from the long layoff between conference finals, but he wasn’t as sharp as he has been for the last two post-seasons. The Oilers pulled out the win, and now they have the early lead in the series. With both teams back in the swing of things, getting win number two will be even tougher.', 'Support RawCharge by using our Affiliate Link when Shopping Hockey Apparel !']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNDVSV1JKUTBjelZqUkZkM2N4VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZQk1JZ3JxUVU=-w280-h168-p-df

The resulting penalty paved the way for Florida’s Brad Marchand to score the go-ahead goal on the power play.', 'Bennett scoring his second of the night early in the second period put the Panthers up 3-1. They entered 31-0 over the past three playoffs since coach Paul Maurice took over when leading at the first or second intermission.', 'With Connor McDavid leading the way, the Oilers rallied.

For the second consecutive season, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers will duke it out for hockey’s Holy Grail.', 'As I pack my bags for Edmonton – and, yes, I’m praying this year’s back-and-forth travel will be smoother than last year’s adventures (first world problems) – the spotlight on the NHL shines bright on Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers’ revenge tour. With the Panthers looking to go back-to-back, the storylines surrounding their club is also front and centre.', 'But as we skate into June, the bright lights of the Stanley Cup Final will also point in the direction of the silly season, as 30 other NHL clubs begin to ramp up their off-season planning.', 'Trade chatter is about to pick up and with a shallow free agent pool, some teams may be more inclined to dive into the trade market in the weeks leading up to the NHL Draft in Los Angeles.', 'The smoke will start to thicken a week from now, when the NHL Scouting Combine gets underway in Buffalo.', 'The Sabres, who brought in Jarmo Kekalainen as a Senior Advisor, will be an intriguing team to watch in the weeks ahead. With multiple players uneased with the team’s lack of advancement, there is an opportunity for Kekalainen and GM Kevyn Adams to be active – it is time the organization takes the next steps in its progression.', 'We have already reported Bowen Byram is in play, again, in Buffalo. Ahead of the trade deadline, names like Owen Power, J.J. Peterka and Alex Tuch were also tossed around as the vultures circled their prey. Is there more of a willingness to make bold moves now?', 'I am curious to see if the Sabres circle back on Elias Pettersson in Vancouver.', 'The 26-year-old centre will see his no-movement clause kick-in July 1 and the belief across the NHL is the Canucks will continue to entertain trade calls. It does not sound like the price tag has changed much, if at all, so a team will have to pay up to pry him out of B.C. Do the Sabres take another swing? They surely won’t be the lone team to try.', 'Pettersson won’t be the only topic of discussion surrounding the Canucks over the next few weeks. Goalie Thatcher Demko appears open to a change of scenery and is expected to be in play as he enters the final year of his contract.', 'Demko, who has a $5 million cap hit and does not own any no-trade protection, has had health concerns, but he is excited to have a normal summer. I’m told he is not battling any issues and is already training for next season, and with the Canucks committed to Kevin Lankinen, teams evaluating their goaltending position will be an option for Vancouver.', 'The focus in Vancouver seems to be centred around adding more offence up front and replacing Brock Boeser, who will become an unrestricted free agent this summer.', 'Boeser, 28, is a “longshot” to re-sign with the Canucks, one team source confirmed to me this week. He is prepared to move on to the next chapter of his career and will attract significant interest this summer, especially given the limited market.', 'There are plenty of questions in Toronto, too, especially after GM Brad Treliving met with the media on Thursday. I was in attendance and understood Treliving’s apologetic tone when he offered little insight on multiple subjects since he and his staff haven’t fully mapped out their plan. Do I believe they don’t have an idea where they stand with Mitch Marner and John Tavares? Absolutely not. But I get where he is coming from.', 'An extension for Tavares is much more likely than one with Marner at this point in time. All indications are Marner is heading to free agency. He hasn’t closed the door on a return to Toronto, but he wants to evaluate his options. ', 'It has been widely reported which teams will come knocking on Marner’s door if/when he becomes available. I don’t subscribe to the sign-and-trade theory – it just won’t play out that way. Now, could the Leafs trade his rights for a draft pick to give a team a headstart in contract negotiations? That seems more plausible.', 'Just about every team will poke around, but I believe Marner has a list of seven or eight teams he prefers to go to if the offers are in place. Los Angeles and Vegas are two of those clubs. Teams with a boatload of cap space may be willing to go above and beyond financially, like Anaheim, Columbus and San Jose, but would Marner prefer to sign with a club closer to contention?', 'Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Knights have just over $9.6 million in salary cap space and a few decent holes to fill. Word on the street is they are entertaining calls on defenceman Nic Hague, who is set to become a restricted free agent July 1 and is due for a solid paycheck.', 'Multiple sources indicated this week that Vegas has already started to engage in trade discussions involving Hague, who brings size, accountability and a championship pedigree to any club looking to strengthen their defensive corps. Several teams will be poking around, and this should be something to keep an eye on leading up to Draft weekend.', 'We are two days from June and the action is just starting to percolate. Once Boston and Pittsburgh announce their Head Coach hirings in the coming days, we’ll start to hear more out of their camps, as well.', 'The silly season has returned. Let’s see how silly things get this year.', 'First order of business for Islanders GM Mathieu Darche: finalize the contract extensions for defenceman Adam Boqvist (one-year) and veteran winger Kyle Palmieri (two-years). Both players had “handshake” agreements under former GM Lou Lamoriello – I believe Palmieri’s deal was in place since the trade deadline – and both sought clarity after the team announced Lou wasn’t returning. Darche honoured both deals, with some say from up top.', 'Darche also indicated they plan on moving forward with the first-overall pick in the Draft, but I would not be shocked if the San Jose Sharks, holding the second-overall selection, make an attempt to move up to draft Matthew Schaefer.', 'As I reported Thursday on the social platform formerly known as Twitter, Brock Nelson is open to signing a contract with the Colorado Avalanche. The Avs and Nelson’s camp are expected to pick up discussions in the coming weeks, and while nothing is set in stone and he may very well hit July 1, there is mutual interest.', 'Luke Richardson, who interviewed for some of the Head Coach positions that were vacant out there, is under consideration for a role on Rick Tocchet’s bench in Philadelphia.', 'The Calgary Flames are making a change behind their bench. I reported earlier this month that Brad Larsen is sticking around. Yesterday, I tweeted (X’d?) that Dan Lambert is not returning next season. Not yet confirmed, but some whispers that Wranglers coach Trent Cull jump back to Calgary as an assistant coach.', 'Expect the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins to announce their Head Coach hirings at some point this weekend, possibly by Monday.', 'Edmonton inquired about Jeremy Swayman this season, well after he signed his deal with Boston, but with how much Stuart Skinner gets criticized, Stu seems to be doing fine in net for the Oilers.', 'It is still very fresh, and a lot of people are still dissecting Pete DeBoer’s goalie decision and post-game comments, but the Dallas Stars have less than $5 million in salary cap space this off-season. Some league sources believe Mason Marchment and his $4.5 million cap hit will be in play.', 'Plenty of chatter surrounding the New York Rangers these days. K’Andre Miller, Chris Kreider and Mika Zibanejad are just three names swirling around out there.', 'Reports suggesting Jonathan Marchessault is available are accurate, as far as I have gathered. But he has a 15-team no-trade list that was strategically put together, so we shall see if Nashville gets to the finish line on anything.', 'The Utah Mammoth are believed to be open to moving the fourth-overall pick. Some believe Utah GM Bill Armstrong will consider trading the pick for a young top-six, NHL-proven forward.', 'Past Columns:', 'May 19, 2025 - Wind of change blowing through Toronto', 'May 12, 2025 - Farewell tour for Malkin as Penguins rebuild?', '© 2025 TFP Media, Inc.

It’s a little different, less time at home, but we’re up for the challenge.”', 'Prefer it?', '“You have no distractions,” Bennett said. “You’re just with the team, you’re with your guys, and your whole focus is playing hockey.

I want him rewarded for his 10 years of trying to will the Edmonton Oilers to their first Stanley Cup since 1990. Those fans deserve another party, with McDavid as the master of ceremonies.', ""I want to see him permanently overwrite those images of himself as an empty husk after Game 7 last season, his soul seemingly drained from his body by a series so emotionally erratic that he was voted the playoffs' most valuable player moments after losing in the championship finale."", 'I want to see the laziest counterargument to McDavid\'s status as a hockey deity -- that he ""never won the Cup"" -- rendered immaterial, as it eventually was for players such as Alex Ovechkin and Nathan MacKinnon. I want that cathartic scream when he picks up the chalice for the first time. The king deserves his crowning moment.', ""Unfortunately, what I want and what the Florida Panthers are willing to give McDavid aren't at all aligned. They deprived him of his Stanley Cup win last season. They've going to do it again in this Stanley Cup Final rematch, despite the sportsbooks and the majority of pundits believing that it's McDavid's moment."", 'Here are five reasons the Panthers are likely headed for a repeat:', ""It's undeniable that the Oilers are a better team than they were last season."", ""Edmonton's roster is deeper and more cohesive than the 2024 Western Conference champions. They're scoring more (4.06 goals per game) than last season. Their 5-on-5 defense is remarkably better: 1.89 goals per 60 minutes, down from 2.55 last postseason."", ""Perhaps the most impressive part of the Oilers' defensive game has been the ability to close out games -- witness their shot suppression in the last three wins over the Dallas Stars. They were a minus-6 in the third period last postseason; they're a plus-11 this season through 16 games. The only downgrade year-over-year is their penalty kill, which has given up 16 goals in 16 games while it gave up four in 25 games last season. One assumes the return of Mattias Ekholm will help."", 'But the Panthers are also better.', 'Like, a lot better. Which is scary.', '', ""Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here."", ""Florida is a plus-27 in goal differential through 17 games, after finishing at a plus-11 last season. The Panthers are scoring more (3.88) and giving up less (2.29). At 5-on-5, they've gone from 2.39 goals per 60 minutes last season to 3.53 goals per 60 this season. Their power play is up year over year -- something to keep in mind if the Oilers keep struggling on the PK -- and the penalty kill is about the same."", 'They also upgraded in a few roster spots during the season, primarily with the additions of Seth Jones to their second defense pairing and Brad Marchand to their third line.', ""Last season, Florida paired Niko Mikkola with Brandon Montour, a good puck-moving defenseman who parlayed his success with Florida into a free agent deal with the Seattle Kraken. The Panthers registered 49% of the shot attempts and averaged 1.84 goals for and 2.03 goals against per 60 minutes when that pair was on the ice. Mikkola's pairing with Jones is a marked upgrade: 56% of the shot attempts, 4.14 goals for and 1.69 goals against per 60 minutes at 5-on-5. The duo has an expected goals against of 1.48 per 60 minutes -- Montour and Mikkola were at 2.37 last postseason."", 'That\'s not just the addition of Jones to the Panthers\' top four. Mikkola has leveled up into something special, defending better and flashing a surprising amount of offensive speed for a 6-foot-6 defender nicknamed ""The Condor.""', '""Meeks has been a beast. All playoffs, he\'s everywhere,"" Marchand said. ""I don\'t think he gets enough credit. He\'s extremely tough to play against. Then when you play with him, and you realize that he\'s not flashy, but he closes so quick, he\'s always on top of guys and he\'s physical.""', ""The addition of Marchand has also made the Panthers a more dangerous team than last season -- and not only in terms of what's said on the ice during games. The third line of their Cup-winning team was anchored by center Anton Lundell and winger Eetu Luostarinen, a solid duo that skated with a variety of wingers. Putting Marchand with those two after acquiring him at the trade deadline from Boston improved the team in several ways."", 'Marchand, Lundell and Luostarinen have earned 53% of the shot attempts at 5-on-5. They average 4.2 goals and 0.82 goals against per 60 minutes. Marchand has 14 points in 17 games. Luostarinen has 13 points in 17 games. Lundell has five goals and seven assists, and continues to give this team preposterous center depth as sort of a ""Baby Barkov"" for the Panthers.', ""By solidifying that line with Marchand, it allows the Panthers to keep their top six solidified. One duo is Aleksander Barkov and Sam Reinhart. The other duo is Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk. They shuttle Carter Verhaeghe, one of the playoffs' most clutch scorers, and Evan Rodrigues, an analytics darling, between those lines on the wing. Both combinations have yielded results for Florida."", ""But beyond what's happening on the ice -- or perhaps as a catalyst for it -- the Panthers are playing with the poise and confidence of a champion, fortified by a proof of concept that comes only after a Stanley Cup skate."", 'These two goalies have had similar postseason journeys: Inconsistent and middling results early in the playoffs, followed by dominant runs that began in the middle of the second round and carried through to the Stanley Cup Final.', '""Middling"" is probably putting it kindly for Skinner\'s playoffs, where he was benched in the first round and got back into the playoffs only when Calvin Pickard was injured against the Vegas Golden Knights. But from Game 4 against Vegas to the Cup Final, he\'s been scorching hot: 6-1, .944 save percentage, 1.41 goals-against average and three shutouts.', 'Stuart Skinner makes a beautiful stick save to keep the game tied 2-2 for the Oilers vs. the Golden Knights.', ""Bobrovsky wasn't all that great early either until a Game 4 shutout against the Maple Leafs. After that, he went 7-2 with a .944 save percentage, a 1.34 goals-against average and two shutouts."", 'The Florida netminder had a chaotic Stanley Cup Final last season, but ended it with a 23-save effort at home in Game 7 to clinch the Cup. It was the kind of game that reinforced the ""Playoff Bob"" legend that the Oilers will no doubt hear about again this season.', 'Averaged out, Skinner and Bobrovsky were both at replacement levels for the totality of the playoffs according to Stathletes. Over their past five games, Bobrovsky (2.35 goals saved above expected) has been better analytically than Skinner (1.89).', 'Skinner is playing well enough where he shouldn\'t lose this series for Edmonton, which is really all they can ask from him and Pickard. But Bobrovsky, assuming he\'s in ""Playoff Bob"" mode, can win this series for Florida. That\'s the difference.', ""The most significant change year-over-year between these teams is that the Oilers have home-ice advantage this time. Unfortunately, that might play into the Panthers' hands."", ""Florida is 8-2 on the road, which is tied for the sixth-best winning percentage in NHL postseason history (minimum eight road games). Their 4.80 goals per game would make them the highest-scoring road playoff team in Stanley Cup history (again, minimum eight road games). That plus-27 goal differential in the postseason? It has all come on the road, where they've scored 48 times and given up 21 goals. They're even (18 for and 18 against) at home."", '""It\'s us against the world. That kind of feeling,"" defenseman Gustav Forsling said.', ""There are two clear reasons for the Panthers' road dominance. The first is that Florida is at its absolute best when it trims the flourish out of its offensive game to become a blunt instrument."", '""Our mindset is just play as simple as we can,"" Verhaeghe said. ""Get the puck deep, get on their defense and forecheck, which is our strength.""', 'The other reason: The Panthers absolutely love to suck the energy out of a road arena and send the opposing fans home feeling miserable.', '""It\'s fun when you\'re on the road and it goes quiet. It feels like we\'re doing our job,"" Verhaeghe said.', ""Joe Fortenbaugh explains why he's taking the Panthers to repeat as champions against the Oilers."", 'Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl can exert their will on a period, a game and a series. McDavid is coming off a series against Dallas in which he had nine points in five games, for example.', 'Florida has one of those guys, too. Barkov doesn\'t get mentioned with the same breathless praise as the Oilers\' duo or Auston Matthews or Nathan MacKinnon or Sidney Crosby. He has broken 90 points only once in his career, although his points-per-game rate between 2017-25 (1.11) ranks him 12th among all skaters, right between Crosby and Cale Makar. He\'s not the most vocal guy, nor does he have the most boisterous personality -- Panthers coach Paul Maurice joked that Barkov is ""not doing a podcast when he\'s done [playing].""', ""All of those players mentioned are Hart Trophy guys. Barkov is a Selke Trophy guy, having been named as the NHL's best defensive forward for the third time in his career this week. You can't be both. Since the best defensive forward award was first handed out in 1977-78, only two players have ever won a Hart and a Selke at some point in their careers: Sergei Fedorov and Bobby Clarke. As of this season, the highest Barkov ever placed for MVP was sixth in 2020-21."", ""But he's just as much of a game changer and series shifter as any other superstar, only his ability to do so sometimes starts in the defensive zone. Against Edmonton last postseason, the Panthers outscored the Oilers 5-2 with Barkov on the ice during those seven games, earning the majority of the shot attempts and scoring chances."", 'He can create something out of nothing with his puck control and large frame.', 'Witness the series clincher against Carolina:', 'Carter Verhaeghe fires home a big-time goal to give the Panthers a lead late in the third period.', 'Rodrigues said that goal ""speaks to who [Barkov] is as a person"" after Game 5.', '""He\'s so even-keeled,"" Rodrigues said. ""Doesn\'t get too high, doesn\'t get too low, and just when games get intense and very emotional, he\'s able to play his game and just do the right things over and over again.""', 'Which brings us to perhaps the most salient point in this prediction.', ""This might be hyperbolic but that's never stopped me before: I think the Panthers are basically built to be an Oilers countermeasure."", ""They can score with the Oilers. They can defend as good as any team in the NHL. They have impactful star players and effective role players. They're unfazed by chaotic road environments. They're well-coached. They play with a physicality, swagger and antagonism. They can dish it out and take it and then dish it out again."", ""But they also have that special trait shared with other great NHL champions, which is that they're willing to win on their terms or on whatever terms the opponents will set for them."", ""Think about the Western Conference finals. Think about how the Dallas Stars felt like they had toppled into an abyss when the Oilers would score the first goal. Think about how they could send only four shots on Skinner in the third period of must-win games, frustrated to no end that they couldn't play their game."", ""The Panthers don't get flustered. They don't lose their confidence or have their hope extinguished if things aren't to their liking. They maximize the opportunities they earn. They're meticulous and patient where others are harried and panicked."", 'Carolina was a stingy defensive team. The Panthers waited for their chances to pounce, and when they did, the games changed dramatically. In each of their wins over the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals, the Panthers scored multiple goals within four minutes of each other. Florida is the most ""blood in the water"" team in the NHL. In Game 3, it was five goals in 9:08. In Game 5, it was three goals in 4:36.', '""We go into the game, we know exactly what we need to do,"" Barkov said. ""The confidence level is high and everyone\'s having fun right now.""', 'The Florida Panthers win 5-3 in a back-and-forth Game 5 battle vs. the Hurricanes to advance to their third consecutive Stanley Cup Final.', 'GM Bill Zito and his staff have constructed a Stanley Cup champion whose core players have the postseason competence and drive that other teams desperately try to import into their lineups at the deadline every season. The Panthers don\'t need an infusion of ""rings in the room."" They almost all have them now. Playoff self-assurance is a nucleotide in their hockey DNA.', 'Their ""win at all costs"" style has earned them detractors, but it has also earned them three consecutive trips to the Stanley Cup Final.', ""Based on the Panthers' recent play and their advantages in this matchup, it'll also earn them a second straight skate with Stanley."", ""And if I'm wrong, then Connor McDavid has his championship moment.

In between, he was greeted with derisive chants of “Ser-gei! Ser-gei!” that followed goals he allowed.', 'At the other end, Skinner made a handful of saves that were vital to keeping the Panthers from extending their lead or going back ahead late in the third, getting friendlier chants of “Stuuuu! Stuuuu!” every time he turned aside a difficult shot.', '“He was great again,” McDavid said. “He gave us a chance.”', 'Up next', 'Game 2 is Friday night in Edmonton before the series shifts to Florida for Games 3 and 4.', 'What is DirecTV?', 'DirecTV is a comprehensive internet TV service that offers your favorite entertainment, news and sports channels, as well as local TV stations and regional sports networks.

Why American hockey fans should root for the Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nhl-finals-edmonton-oilers-stanley-cup-trump-canada-rcna210497,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Whether you’re an actual Canadian person or simply one of the roughly 10% of Americans who, like me, consider themselves diehard ice hockey fans, this week no doubt finds you largely consumed — if not full-on bedridden — by a little something I like to call Stanley Cup Fever (or La Fièvre de la Coupe Stanley as it is known to my avid French Canadian readership).', 'The fact that the Panthers’ logo looks like it was meant for a life insurance company makes the concept of a South Florida Stanley Cup champ unacceptable to me.', 'This year’s contest is a rematch of last year’s finals — with the Edmonton Oilers facing off against the defending champion Florida Panthers. There is no shortage of reasons I am rooting for the Oilers to whip the Panthers around like a bunch of rag dolls and assume their rightful place as Stanley Cup champions for the first time in 35 years — and also the first Canadian franchise to win the Cup in ... wait for it ... 32 years.', 'I insist you root for the Oilers, as well.', '“But Dave,” you ask, “didn’t the Oilers rebuff your offer to perform both the Canadian and American national anthems on electric guitar at an Oilers home game a couple of years ago after someone in the Oilers organization saw you doing that very thing at an Anaheim Ducks home game just a couple weeks prior — even though it was totally amazing, and you can ask anyone?”', 'And to that I say yes, but I have moved on mostly, and so should you. (Also, thank you for your support; I’m nothing without the fans.)', 'Anyway, the first reason I would like the Oilers to win this year is that they were my favorite NHL team as a kid. I grew up on the mean streets of suburban Cleveland, and, since we didn’t have an NHL team of our own, I had no choice but to offer my allegiances elsewhere.', 'The fact that the Oilers had cool blue and orange jerseys and a young Wayne Gretzky in their lineup — along with fellow future Hockey Hall of Famers Mark Messier, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri — made it a no-brainer. My dad even took my brother and me to see the Oilers play the Penguins at the Civic Arena (the first major sports venue in the world with a retractable roof, for all you retractable roof enthusiasts) in Pittsburgh, and I got my program signed by all four of those guys outside the players entrance and everything.', 'Gretzky still had a perm at the time, which made it all the more exciting. In fact, I would like to think it was my own youthful enthusiasm combined with that perm that helped lead the team to Stanley Cup victories in ’84, ’85, ’87 and ’88. (The Oilers won one more Cup in 1990, but Gretzky had already been traded to the Los Angeles Kings and had sadly adopted a more close-cropped, chemical-free look by then, foreshadowing his future as an online gambling shill, among other things.)', 'Another reason I would like the Oilers to win this year is that — despite the fact that it is my dream for hockey to become the No. 1 sport in the United States and the presence of the sport in as many areas of the country as possible is crucial to that development — as a quarter-Canadian (my grandfather was from Clinton, Ontario) I struggle to accept the playing of professional hockey in regions where snow and ice don’t naturally occur. I’m not a religious man, but I just think it goes against God. And the fact that the Panthers’ logo looks like it was meant for a life insurance company or something makes the very concept of a South Florida Stanley Cup champion just unacceptable to me.', 'This year’s Stanley Cup is bigger than just the game of hockey.', 'But the biggest reason, with geopolitical importance, that I would like the Oilers to beat the Panthers is that we live in a time when the actual president of the United States — whose non-White House primary residence just so happens to be a resort/ex-wife cemetery in South Florida — suggests with disturbing regularity that Canada should become the 51st state. Aside from a handful of people I will (at the risk of sounding uncharitable) call Albertan lunatics, almost no one in Canada would ever entertain the prospect of being annexed by the neighbor to the South.', 'In light of this, this year’s Stanley Cup is bigger than just the game of hockey, sort of like how the U.S. men’s team’s facing off against the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics was essentially the Cold War on ice (Note to self: Write musical titled “The Cold War on Ice.”)', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'I wouldn’t go as far as to say that the Oilers’ winning the sacred chalice of Canada’s Game would send a message to Donald Trump, as I’m not convinced he is capable of receiving such things. But I do think it would upset him. And I really like that idea.', '“The once great sport of hockey has been ruined by the foreigners of Edmonton, who are not very nice,” the president might say. “Brave men on very cold water, ice they call it, with knives strapped to their feet ... not butter knives but more like steak knives that you would use to eat Trump Steaks ... not that you would even need a knife to eat a Trump steak, because they were very tender, very tender, almost like liquid meat, many people have said, including chef Guy Fieri, who is a great friend, but the nasty Canadian Oilers will never know because they, just like my son Eric, will never be invited to the White House, this much I can tell you.”', '“Also hockey is canceled in Florida. Your tax dollars will not pay for Brad Marchand any longer. One more thing: If global warming is real, then why is there ice inside the arena?”', 'Go, Canada.
