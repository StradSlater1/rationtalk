Humpback Whales Blow Vortex Bubble Rings to Potentially Communicate with Humans,https://www.techeblog.com/humpback-whales-vortex-bubble-rings-communication/,"['Humpback whales have a new behavior that’s got researchers intrigued. Scientists from the SETI Institute and the University of California at Davis observed humpbacks crafting massive bubble rings during friendly encounters with humans, possibly in an attempt to communicate.', 'This discovery stems from 12 episodes involving 11 individual whales, who collectively produced 39 bubble rings in places like Hawaii, the Dominican Republic, Mo’orea, and the U.S. Atlantic coast. Unlike their well-known bubble nets used to trap fish or the competitive bubble bursts males deploy during mating season, these rings appear to serve no practical purpose. Instead, they’re blown when whales voluntarily approach boats or swimmers, suggesting a deliberate interaction. Jodi Frediani, a marine wildlife photographer and UC Davis affiliate, describes the scenes as almost whimsical: “Humpback whales often exhibit inquisitive, friendly behavior toward boats and human swimmers.

Scientists photograph whales blowing 'bubble smoke rings' to communicate with humans,https://www.earth.com/news/whales-blow-bubble-smoke-rings-near-humans-to-communicate/,"['Whales are known to be intelligent. They use complex sounds, travel in social groups, and show strong memory. But what happens when they do something not tied to feeding or mating? Could they interact in a creative and playful way using bubble rings?', 'For the first time, researchers from the SETI Institute and the University of California at Davis (UC Davis) have documented humpback whales producing bubble rings during friendly encounters with humans.', 'These bubble rings differ from the bubble nets used in hunting. They appear like spinning smoke donuts, rising gently from the deep.', 'The scientists from WhaleSETI recorded 39 bubble rings from 11 whales across 12 episodes. These were observed in Hawai’i, the Dominican Republic, Mo’orea, and off the U.S. Atlantic coast.', 'The study offers rare insights into nonhuman creativity, and suggests that ring creation could reflect play, communication, or curiosity.', 'At least one whale was seen making a ring using only one nostril. This detail, revealed through frame-by-frame analysis, hints at fine motor control in these large mammals.', '“Because of current limitations on technology, an important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers,” said Dr. Laurance Doyle, SETI Institute scientist and co-author on the paper.', '“This important assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behavior in humpback whales.”', 'Bubble rings were not released in the presence of prey or during fights. Instead, whales appeared relaxed and moved slowly.', 'They often approached boats or swimmers before making a ring. In nine episodes labeled inquisitive, the whales ignored other whales and focused on nearby humans or vessels.', 'Seven of eight ring blowers swam close – within one body length – of boats or swimmers. In one case, a whale’s ring partially surrounded a swimmer at the surface.', '“Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators,” said co-lead author Dr. Fred Sharpe.', '“Now, akin to a candidate signal, we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication.”', 'While bubble rings have been seen in dolphins and beluga whales, this is the first well-documented case in baleen whales.', 'Earlier drone surveys covering thousands of hours in Hawai’i, Alaska, Antarctica, and Bermuda found no rings when humans were absent. This suggests humpbacks may direct these displays at us, either playfully or communicatively.', 'According to the researchers, the bubble rings often came with slow rolling, head lifts, or spy-hopping. These playful actions support the idea that ring-blowing is not accidental. One whale even played with seaweed before producing a ring.', '“Humpback whales often exhibit inquisitive, friendly behavior towards boats and human swimmers,” said co-lead author Jodi Frediani.', '“We’ve now located a dozen whales from populations around the world, the majority of which have voluntarily approached boats and swimmers blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behavior.”', 'Most rings were generated using the blowhole, with no dramatic pre-ring gestures. Unlike dolphins that prepare visibly before blowing a ring, whales give no warning. The action appears smooth and sudden, with no body jerks or O-shaped naris.', 'The team suggests that humpbacks may be engaging in “play with a purpose.” Play could serve as a flexible behavior for testing environments, objects, and responses. It may also allow interspecies connection, much like a dolphin lifting a swimmer or a whale inspecting a human.', 'As with early efforts to classify alien signals, recognizing play and curiosity in other species teaches us how to listen.', 'The WhaleSETI team believes behaviors like ring-blowing may serve as training data to improve algorithms for decoding unknown signals.', 'The whales showed no signs of fear, annoyance, or aggression during these events. Many lingered after producing the ring, possibly watching our reactions. One whale made 11 rings in a single episode, suggesting intentional repetition.', 'Patterns of bubbles – rings, plumes, bursts – may form a continuum. Some bubbles might be failed rings. Others may convey intent or social cues. Documenting these actions and their contexts can improve how we understand other minds.', 'The researchers urge whale watchers, swimmers, and boaters to report such sightings. Include location, behavior, and if possible, visual proof. These citizen reports help build a richer picture of whale behavior and potentially interspecies connection.', 'Karen Pryor, a renowned animal trainer, noted that patterns of bubble production in cetaceans constitute a mode of communication not available to terrestrial mammals.', 'If whales try to communicate with us through bubble rings, even playfully, we should be listening.', 'The study is published in the journal Marine Mammal Science.', '—–', 'Like what you read?

The sociability of these gentle souls is perhaps best represented by a curious behavior they exhibit when approaching humans, in which they create large bubble rings that look like “smoke rings” as they rise to the surface. ', 'A recent study published in Marine Mammal Science suggests that humpback whales may be sending bubble rings like messages to humans as a way to break the ice. Humpback whales have been known to use bubbles as tools, but these new observations reveal a playful side to their skills. Their friendly bubble-blowing behavior is the latest sign that whale intelligence is extremely complex and in need of further research.', 'Humpback whales are known for being calm and non-aggressive during encounters with humans. In fact, these whales rarely attack humans unprovoked, and any damage they inflict upon vessels may simply be an unfortunate mishap caused by their poor eyesight. ', 'Humpback whales even show interest in humans, displaying inquisitive behaviors such as spy hops, when they vertically raise their head above the water to see what’s going on around them.', 'Humpback whales are not only curious creatures, but resourceful ones, too. They use an array of bubble-blowing techniques — from their blowhole or mouth — for various reasons. Bubbles are sometimes used in displays of agonism, or competition, among male humpback whales that are vying to be the primary escort for a female. Other times, whales use “bubble-nets” to corral prey, creating underwater curtains that act as barriers, trapping smaller animals like juvenile salmon and krill.', 'Read More: Big Eyes, Blurry Vision: Why Humpback Whales Struggle to See Clearly', 'To get a glimpse of how whales communicate, the new study explored 12 bubble ring production episodes that were obtained by citizen scientists and researchers. These events involved 39 bubble rings from 11 individual whales, examined through video and photo footage.

According to the researchers, the whales didn’t even show “mild forms of annoyance and evasion” such as diving away or increasing their swim speeds. ', 'On the contrary, the whales appeared relaxed in their movements. A plethora of playful activities accompanied the bubble ring episodes, including tail swishing and pectoral fin slaps. ', 'The bubble ring episodes show how humpback whales try to get chummy with humans, but the true extent of this behavior still isn’t fully understood. ', 'Other species of whales similarly exhibit friendliness toward humans at times, like baleen whales and gray whales that approach and interact with boats. The way that whales communicate in the presence of humans also remains a perennial topic of interest for scientists; orcas, for example, seem to be capable of imitating human speech with clicks and whistles.', 'The bubble rings made by humpback whales could be one of these complex methods of interspecies communication. The researchers say there is room for future studies to find out how exactly these whales can change the structure of bubble rings with their blowholes, presenting certain gestures when interacting with humans.', ""The bubble ring episodes reinforce the idea that there's still much to learn about humpback whales, as they continue to wow us with their exceptional intelligence and outgoing nature."", '“Humpback whales live in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use bubble tools and assist other species being harassed by predators,” said co-lead author Fred Sharpe, a UC Davis Affiliate, in a press release. “Now, akin to a candidate signal, we show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication.”', 'Read More: Orcas Imitate Human Speech as a Way to Communicate With Us', 'Our writers at Discovermagazine.com use peer-reviewed studies and high-quality sources for our articles, and our editors review for scientific accuracy and editorial standards.

Humpback whales blowing bubble rings may be ‘greeting’ humans,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/humpback-whales-blow-bubble-rings-to-greet-human-visitors-wncdb25h7,"['Now showing content from the last twelve months, not just the past six days.', 'When a 30-tonne humpback whale rises from the deep and releases a single, perfectly circular halo of bubbles in your direction, it is difficult not to feel that it is trying to say something.', 'Scientists are now entertaining the possibility that it really might be. In a new study, they describe a series of encounters in which humpback whales approached humans and produced large “bubble rings”.', 'These shimmering loops of air, conjured from their blowholes, did not seem to be designed to warn or intimidate. According to a paper published in the journal Marine Mammal Science, that leaves an intriguing possibility: the whales are saying hello.', 'Researchers from the Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute — a non-profit scientific organisation — and the University of California, Davis, have documented 12 episodes in which humpback whales produced 39 bubble rings. In most cases, the closest other creature was a human rather than another whale.', 'The researchers also studied drone footage of humpbacks — when humans were not near by, they saw no rings.', '“We show they are blowing bubble rings in our direction in an apparent attempt to playfully interact, observe our response, and/or engage in some form of communication,” said Fred Sharpe, co-lead author of the research.', 'Humpbacks have long been known to use bubbles to corral fish into tight shoals as they hunt. Males also produce them while competing for females. These blowhole and mouth expulsions of air typically create “bursts” or “curtains” that are thought to serve as “displays of ferocity”, the paper said.', 'But the newly documented bubbles appear to be something different. The rings are created deliberately and there are no signs that the whales are stressed or agitated. Each hoop of air is made up of a multitude of smaller bubbles giving them an misty, opaque appearance, not unlike a smoke ring produced by a human.', 'They were typically produced during calm, curious encounters, when the whale had approached slowly and lingered near human observers.', '“Most of the whales we observed were the ones that voluntarily swam up to swimmers or boats,” said Jodi Frediani, the paper’s other co-lead author. “The bubble rings seemed to be part of that interaction.”', 'The rings were produced without ceremony, their research found. There was usually a slow rise, a pause and a sudden burst of bubbles.', 'The research is part of the WhaleSeti project, which is looking at non-human intelligence on Earth as a model for recognising alien intelligence out in the cosmos.', 'Laurance Doyle, of the Seti Institute, said: “An important assumption of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is that extraterrestrial intelligence and life will be interested in making contact and so target human receivers. This assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behaviour in humpback whales.”', 'The team drew on citizen scientists, drone footage, whale-watch companies and marine biologists to gather the cases, which were recorded in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. While some episodes occurred near chattering tourists, others took place beside quiet research vessels, suggesting the behaviour wasn’t simply a reaction to noise or stimulation.', 'Bubble-making is common in cetaceans, the family of aquatic mammals to which dolphins and porpoises also belong, but cohesive rings are quite rare and challenging to produce. In dolphins, they’re often linked to social play but the researchers are cautious not to over-interpret the humpbacks’ behaviour.', 'The rings may be play. They may be signals. They may be the instinctive reaction of an intelligent creature faced with something as strange as a boat or a human in the water. Whatever they are, the new study suggests they warrant more investigation.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.
