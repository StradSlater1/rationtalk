Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed,"['Exclusive: Melbourne team demonstrates way to make the virus visible within white blood cells, paving the way to fully clear it from the body', 'A cure for HIV could be a step closer after researchers found a new way to force the virus out of hiding inside human cells.', 'The virus’s ability to conceal itself inside certain white blood cells has been one of the main challenges for scientists looking for a cure. It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.', 'Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.', 'It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when it was used in vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.', 'In a paper published in Nature Communications, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.', 'Globally, there are almost 40 million people living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.', 'It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.', 'The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”', 'When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.', '“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.', '“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”', 'Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.', 'The study is laboratory based and was carried out in cells donated by HIV patients. The path to using the technology as part of a cure for patients is long, and would require successful tests in animals followed by safety trials in humans, likely to take years, before efficacy trials could even begin.', '“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” stressed Cevaal. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.', '“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”', 'Dr Michael Roche of the University of Melbourne and co-senior author of the research, said the discovery could have broader implications beyond HIV, with the relevant white blood cells also involved in other diseases including cancers.', 'Dr Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirologist and emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the approach taken by the Melbourne team appeared be a major advance on existing strategies to force the virus out of hiding, but further studies would be needed to determine how best to kill it after that.', 'He added: “Ultimately, one big unknown remains. Do you need to eliminate the entire reservoir for success or just the major part? If just 10% of the latent reservoir survives will that be sufficient to seed new infection? Only time will tell.', '“However, that does not detract from the significance of the current study, which represents a major potential advance in delivery of mRNA for therapeutic purposes to blood cells.”', 'Prof Tomáš Hanke of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, disputed the idea that getting RNA into white blood cells had been a significant challenge. He said the hope that all cells in the body where HIV was hiding could be reached in this way was “merely a dream”.', 'Thanks for reading 33 articles.

And they have used mRNA technology, the same kind used in Pfizer and Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccines. Nearly 40 million people are living with HIV worldwide.', 'One of the main challenges in curing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lies in its ability to establish latent reservoirs. These are small numbers of infected cells, primarily resting CD4+ T cells, where the virus integrates its genome but remains dormant and invisible to both the immune system and antiretroviral therapies (ART). While ART can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, it cannot eliminate these hidden reservoirs. If treatment stops, the virus can re-emerge and replicate, necessitating lifelong medication for people living with HIV.', 'The Australian team discovered a novel way to deliver “special instructions"" to these hidden, latently infected cells. In a study published in Nature Communications, the researchers demonstrated how they packaged mRNA inside novel, microscopic fat-like bubbles called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), specifically a new design termed “LNP X"".', '', 'The key breakthrough was engineering these LNPs to successfully transport the mRNA into the previously hard-to-reach resting CD4+ T cells. Once delivered, the mRNA instructs these cells to “give up"" the dormant virus, forcing it out of hiding and making it visible.

Breakthrough mRNA Delivery Targets Resting T Cells in HIV,https://www.docwirenews.com/post/breakthrough-mrna-delivery-targets-resting-t-cells-in-hiv,"['Breakthrough mRNA Delivery Targets Resting T Cells in HIV', 'A recent study published in Nature Communications introduces a groundbreaking approach to HIV treatment by effectively delivering mRNA to resting CD4+ T cells, a significant challenge in the field. The researchers, from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia, developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation, termed LNP X, capable of transfecting these hard-to-reach cells without inducing toxicity or activation.', '“Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure,” said Dr. Paula Cevaal, a research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study.', 'The researchers identified a novel LNP formulation with the unique capability to transfect CD4+ T cells without the need for pre-stimulation. Using this formulation, called LNP X, they encapsulated two mRNA-based latency-reversing agents (LRAs), which demonstrated efficient activation of HIV transcription in CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy ex vivo.', 'LNP X was engineered by replacing the conventional ionizable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA with SM-102 and incorporating β-sitosterol, enhancing its ability to deliver mRNA into the cytosol of resting T cells. This formulation achieved up to 76% transfection efficiency in non-stimulated CD4+ T cells, a notable improvement over existing methods.', 'The study demonstrated that LNP X could deliver mRNA encoding the HIV Tat protein, a potent activator of HIV transcription. In ex vivo experiments using CD4+ T cells from individuals on antiretroviral therapy, Tat-LNP X significantly increased HIV RNA transcription without causing cellular activation or toxicity. This suggests that LNP X can reverse HIV latency effectively while maintaining cell viability.', 'Furthermore, LNP X was used to co-deliver components of the CRISPR activation system, including dCas9-VP64 mRNA, MS2-p65-HSF1 mRNA, and guide RNAs targeting the HIV long terminal repeat region. This approach successfully activated HIV transcription in resting CD4+ T cells, highlighting the versatility of LNP X in delivering complex RNA-based therapeutics.', 'To the researchers’ knowledge, this is the first demonstration of successful, non-toxic in vitro transfection of primary T cells without the need for T cell pre-stimulation, a condition previously believed to be essential for efficient LNP transfection. These data suggest that the superior potency of LNP X results from increased cellular association and enhanced efficiency of mRNA translation after cytosolic delivery, which contrasts with earlier hypotheses that attributed improved performance to enhanced endosomal escape mediated by β-sitosterol.', '“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic—that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” Cevaal shared with The Guardian. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.”', '', 'Cevaal PM, et al.

One strategy to eradicate latent HIV is to activate viral transcription, followed by elimination of infected cells through virus-mediated cytotoxicity or immune-mediated clearance. We hypothesised that mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology would provide an opportunity to deliver mRNA encoding proteins able to reverse HIV latency in resting CD4+ T cells. Here we develop an LNP formulation (LNP X) with unprecedented potency to deliver mRNA to hard-to-transfect resting CD4+ T cells in the absence of cellular toxicity or activation. Encapsulating an mRNA encoding the HIV Tat protein, an activator of HIV transcription, LNP X enhances HIV transcription in ex vivo CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV. LNP X further enables the delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) activation machinery to modulate both viral and host gene transcription. These findings offer potential for the development of a range of nucleic acid-based T cell therapeutics.', 'Recent advances in mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology have allowed for the development of new vaccines and therapeutics, holding great promise for gene therapy. In 2018, patisiran (Onpattro) was approved as the first LNP-based therapeutic for the delivery of silencing (si)RNA for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis1. The same platform has since been used to deliver mRNA to generate two of the most effective vaccines against COVID-19 (Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) and Spikevax (Moderna)). More recently, LNPs have been used to deliver mRNA for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo, which was found to be safe in human clinical trials2. These advances have triggered enormous interest in the use of mRNA-LNPs as versatile therapeutics, including for infectious diseases such as HIV.', 'Whilst antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively inhibits active HIV replication and reduces morbidity and mortality, it is not curative and treatment is life-long3. The major barrier to HIV cure is the persistence of latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells harbouring replication-competent virus4,5,6, which can rebound following T cell activation and re-establish viremia in the absence of ART. One approach towards an HIV cure is to reactivate HIV transcription using latency-reversing agents (LRAs) while on ART, with the goal of subsequently inducing death of the infected cells and reduction of the HIV reservoir through viral cytopathic effects or immune-mediated clearance of the infected cell7,8. Traditionally, this has been achieved using small, hydrophobic compounds, that target different cellular pathways to activate transcription9,10. These first-generation LRAs, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, can be administered systemically and passively cross the plasma membrane to exert their effect intracellularly. Several LRAs have demonstrated induction of HIV RNA in vitro, ex vivo and in clinical trials; yet, to date, no clinical trial of an LRA alone has shown a reduction in the size of the HIV reservoir7,8,11,12,13,14,15.', 'There are several hypotheses as to why LRAs alone have not been able to induce clearance of infected cells. First, most first-generation LRAs only increase the initiation of HIV transcription (as measured by unspliced HIV RNA), but fail to overcome subsequent blocks in transcription elongation, completion and splicing that persist in a resting CD4+ T cell10. Second, first-generation LRAs are not HIV-specific, and therefore their potency to reactivate HIV is unavoidably coupled to off-target and adverse effects8,16,17. Indeed, certain LRAs have been shown to directly inhibit CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell function in vitro, potentially hampering immune-mediated clearance of reactivated cells18,19. Therefore, there is a need for new LRAs that have greater potency, lower toxicity, and greater specificity for the HIV provirus.', 'Recently, two HIV-specific nucleic acid-based LRAs have been reported. The first is an LNP encapsulating mRNA encoding the HIV protein Trans-activator of Transcription (Tat), which binds to the trans-activation response element (TAR) in nascent HIV transcripts produced from the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promotor region and potently enhances transcriptional processivity20,21,22. Although this Tat-LNP could reverse latency both in vitro and ex vivo21,22, a small molecule non-specific LRA was required to achieve high potency—an observation consistent with suboptimal delivery of the Tat mRNA21. The second is HIV LTR-targeted CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), comprising of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein combined with transcriptional activator domains, which provides a promising strategy for highly HIV-specific activation of transcription without affecting host-cell transcription23,24,25,26,27,28. However, both these novel LRAs have not progressed to primary cells or the clinic due to the lack of an efficient delivery vehicle to resting CD4+ T cells, which are known to be recalcitrant to traditional gene delivery systems29.', 'We therefore aimed to develop an LNP capable of delivering mRNA to resting T cells for potent, HIV-specific latency reversal. We identified an LNP formulation with the unique capability to transfect CD4+ T cells in the absence of pre-stimulation. We then used this LNP formulation, LNP X, to encapsulate two mRNA-based LRAs encoding for HIV Tat and CRISPRa, which demonstrated efficient activation of HIV transcription in CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV on ART ex vivo. Together, these findings provide an exciting new approach to mRNA-based therapeutics for T cells.', 'We first assessed whether an LNP similar to an existing, FDA-approved LNP formulation (patisiran) was able to transfect non-stimulated primary CD4+ T cells by delivering a reporter mCherry mRNA. Our patisiran-like LNP (hereafter referred to as patisiran LNP) is formulated with DMG-PEG2000 instead of PEG2000-C-DMG. At the highest dose tested of 500\u2009ng per 105 cells, mCherry expression was only detected in 2.1\u2009±\u20090.4% (mean\u2009±\u2009SEM) of live cells (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a) after 72\u2009h incubation. Pre-stimulation of the CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 led to substantially higher transfection efficiencies of up to 51\u2009±\u20095.1% compared to non-stimulated T cells (Fig. 1a), though the toxicity associated with patisiran LNP treatment was greater in pre-stimulated compared to non-stimulated CD4+ T cells at higher LNP doses (Fig. S1b). These data show that successful mRNA delivery to primary CD4+ T cells using patisiran LNPs is dependent on the activation state of the T cell.', 'a CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative donors were rested or pre-stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, then treated with LNPs (similar to the patisiran lipid composition) encapsulating mCherry mRNA for 72\u2009h at the indicated doses. Highest dose of mCherry-LNP X corresponds to 2.5\u2009µg/mL. Transfection efficiency was determined by measuring mCherry expression using flow cytometry.

Mean\u2009±\u2009SEM, n\u2009=\u20096 donors.', 'We therefore modified the lipid composition of the LNP to enhance potency. First, the ionisable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) was replaced with SM-102, an ionisable lipid previously shown to lead to greater cytosolic mRNA delivery through enhanced endosomal escape30. Second, the SM-102-LNPs were further modified using ß-sitosterol, a naturally-occurring cholesterol analogue associated with enhanced mRNA delivery31, to create a formulation referred to as LNP X (Fig. 1b). LNP X encapsulating reporter mCherry mRNA was formulated reproducibly and did not significantly differ in size, polydispersity or mRNA encapsulation efficiency compared to patisiran LNP (Fig. 1c and Table 1).', 'We assessed the potency of LNP X by treating Jurkat T cells, an immortalised T cell line, with increasing doses of reporter mRNA encapsulated in either patisiran LNP or LNP X. Treatment with LNP X compared to patisiran LNP resulted in up to 6-fold higher mCherry expression (Fig. 1d), confirming its superior potency. To assess the potency of our LNP X formulation further, we treated pre-stimulated CD4+ T cells with LNP X and observed mCherry expression in >75% of cells, in all doses tested, including a low dose of 6.25\u2009ng mCherry-LNP X per 105 cells (Fig. 1e and Fig. S1a). Impressively, and in stark contrast to patisiran LNP, LNP X was able to achieve transfection of up to 76\u2009±\u20093.8% CD4+ T cells in the absence of pre-stimulation (Fig. 1a–e). Moreover, toxicity was negligible compared to baseline in both pre-stimulated and non-stimulated CD4+ T cells (Fig. S1c). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of potent transfection of primary, resting T cells in vitro in the absence of cellular toxicity.', 'LNP X was able to transfect both naïve and all memory T cell subsets (Fig. S2a–d), with effector memory T cells expressing higher levels of mCherry than naïve T cells (p\u2009=\u20090.007), potentially reflecting the higher basal translational activity in this memory T cell subset. Even in the context of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), LNP X was able to deliver mRNA to CD4+ T cells (Fig. S2e, f). Expression of mRNA was also detected in most other PBMC subsets, specifically monocytes, demonstrating that LNP X is T cell tropic, but not T cell specific.', 'To understand the mechanism behind the superior potency of LNP X, we employed a SNAPswitch reporter system to quantify sub-cellular localisation of therapeutics in Jurkat T cells32 (Fig. 2a). SNAPswitch was recently used to probe the role that ionisable lipids play in delivering mRNA to the cytosol. This work showed that SM-102 had similar cytosolic delivery compared to DLin-MC3-DMA, the ionisable lipid found in patisiran LNP, however the protein expression induced by SM-102 was significantly higher33. To probe LNP X’s superior potency, we formulated SNAPswitch LNP X and compared these to LNPs formulated with SM-102, DSPC, DMG-PEG2000 and cholesterol. SNAPswitch LNP X did not exhibit different physicochemical characteristics compared to LNP X encapsulating a single reporter mRNA (Fig. S3). The LNP X formulation resulted in 10.5-fold enhanced mRNA expression in SNAPswitch Jurkat T cells (p\u2009=\u20090.0029, Fig. 2b). This enhanced transfection was in part explained by a 2.5-fold increase in LNP association, representing LNPs bound to the cell surface or internalised (p\u2009=\u20090.0025, Fig. 2c), yet LNP X still exhibited 4.1-fold higher protein expression relative to the amount of LNP association (p\u2009=\u20090.0032, Fig. 2d).', 'a The SNAPswitch assay simultaneously tracks the degree of nanoparticle association, endosomal escape and mRNA expression of LNPs co-encapsulating an AF488 oligo, Cy5-SNAPswitch oligo and mRNA encoding mScarlet.

Significance was determined using a one-tailed paired ratio t test in (b–e,g) to allow comparisons of MFI values between experiments, or one-tailed unpaired t test in (f), ns non-significant.', 'While LNP X yielded an overall higher level of cytosolic cargo delivery (Fig. 2e), this effect correlated with the higher levels of LNP association to cells observed with LNP X. Indeed, the efficiency of endosomal escape was not improved by replacing cholesterol with ß-sitosterol (Fig. 2f). Importantly, the protein expression relative to the amount of mRNA delivered to the cytosol was enhanced by 5.3-fold when using LNP X (p\u2009=\u20090.0012, Fig. 2g), suggesting that the superior potency of LNP X involved processes downstream of endosomal escape and cytosolic delivery of the mRNA cargo. Our findings regarding the role of ß-sitosterol are consistent with previous studies comparing DLin-MC3-DMA/cholesterol to DLin-MC3-DMA/ß-sitosterol LNPs33, indicating the observed effects of ß-sitosterol are independent of the ionisable lipid.', 'We next aimed to assess whether LNP X was able to deliver a small, therapeutic mRNA expressing the 72 amino acids of the first coding exon of HIV Tat (Tat-LNP X, Fig. 3a and Table S1). This form of HIV Tat is normally expressed from the late-phase, Rev-dependent 4\u2009kb viral Tat mRNA34. We first validated the potency of Tat-LNP X in J-Lat 10.6 cells, a T cell line model of HIV latency that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the HIV LTR promoter. Treatment with Tat-LNP X, but not control mCherry-LNP X, resulted in an increase in GFP expression consistent with potent reactivation of LTR-mediated transcription (Fig. 3b). No impact on cellular viability was observed (Fig. S4). Similarly, Tat-LNP X was able to induce productive infection in primary CD4+ T cells infected with an HIV reporter virus (pMorpheus-V535; p\u2009=\u20090.0025) similar to levels seen after T cell activation with the mitogens phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Fig. S5).', 'a Schematic overview of the mechanism of action of HIV Tat on promoting transcription elongation.

Reactivation of HIV LTR-mediated transcription was determined after 24\u2009h by measuring GFP expression. Highest dose of Tat-LNP X corresponds to 1\u2009µg/mL.

Significance was determined using a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, ns non-significant.', 'To assess latency reversal ex vivo, we treated CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV on suppressive ART with an equivalent dose of 200\u2009ng per 105 cells Tat-LNP X or control mCherry-LNP X for 48–72\u2009h. The expression of cell-associated HIV RNA was measured as described previously36,37, whereby we simultaneously quantified transcription initiation, elongation, completion and splicing37. After a single dose of Tat-LNP X, all measured HIV transcripts were significantly upregulated compared to non-treated control cells suggesting Tat-LNP X induces, and overcomes blocks in, transcription initiation (TAR transcript), proximal and distal elongation (Long-LTR and Pol transcripts, respectively), completion of transcription (Poly(A) transcripts) and splicing (Tat-Rev transcripts; detected by a primer/probe set that spans the junction between the first and second coding exon of tat and rev) (Fig. 3c–g and Fig. S6a–e). The induction of multiply-spliced Tat-Rev transcripts, an important predictor of virion production ex vivo38, was induced by 112-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared to untreated control). Treatment with Tat-LNP X or control mCherry-LNP X resulted in minimal overall toxicity (Fig. 3h). Importantly, the induction of HIV RNA transcription following Tat-LNP X significantly exceeded that observed in fully activated T cells stimulated using two mitogens, PMA and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (considered the gold-standard to reverse HIV latency in vitro and ex vivo37,38) (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all transcripts). However, in contrast to PMA/PHA treatment, Tat-LNP X did not induce any change in cellular activation as observed by minimal changes to the expression of activation markers CD25, CD69 and HLA-DR compared to non-treated control cells (Fig. S6f–h). Furthermore, treatment with Tat-LNP X, but not mCherry-LNP X, resulted in a 17.2-fold increase in supernatant HIV RNA, indicating virion production following latency reversal (Fig. 3i). However, the reversal of latency by Tat-LNP X did not result in a decline in intact proviral DNA after 5-day culture (Fig. 3j–l). Combined, these findings demonstrate that Tat-LNP X is a highly potent latency-reversing agent that can overcome HIV RNA transcription and processing blocks to elongation, splicing and completion, and induce viral protein expression, all in the absence of T cell activation.', 'We next assessed whether LNP X was able to encapsulate and deliver CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) machinery as a more complex and larger RNA-based, highly HIV-specific therapeutic. The dCas9-synergistic activation mediator (dCas9-SAM) CRISPRa system consists of a catalytically inactive (dead) Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a multimer of C-terminal herpes virus transcriptional activation domain 16 (VP64), which is guided to the genomic target site by a guide RNA (gRNA). The gRNA is modified to contain minimal hairpin aptamers that allow the recruitment of introduced p65 and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription activators through binding of the bacteriophage protein MS239 (Fig. 4a). The recruitment of multiple copies of the MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein, which synergise with dCas9-VP64, greatly enhances the potency of CRISPRa39, but can result in non-specific promoter activation if present in excess. We therefore first optimised the relative dose of the three RNAs that comprise the dCas9-SAM CRISPRa machinery. We found that a relative mass ratio of 0.8: 0.00625: 1 (dCas9-VP64 mRNA: MS2-p65-HSF1 mRNA: gRNA) yielded the optimal balance between on-target potency and non-specific background reactivation in cell lines (Fig. S7).', 'a Schematic overview of the dCas9-synergistic activation mediator (SAM) CRISPR activation system, consisting of a catalytically inactive (dead, d)Cas9 fused to transcriptional activator domain VP64, a gRNA and a further transcriptional activation MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein that is recruited to the Cas9-gRNA complex via MS2-binding to stem-loop structures in the gRNA scaffold.

Induction of CD25 expression was measured by surface stain using flow cytometry. CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative donors were treated with indicated doses of CRISPRa-LNP X per 105 cells or mCherry-LNP X as a control for 72\u2009h (c) or 6 days (d), after which CD25 expression was determined using flow cytometry.

Significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test.', 'We next developed a model system in which CRISPRa was targeted to the promoter of an endogenous gene, IL2RA (cd25), to induce overexpression of the CD25 receptor on the cell surface. CRISPRa-LNP X was formulated by co-encapsulating the two mRNAs and a CD25-targeting or a scrambled control gRNA. The CD25-targeting gRNA was validated in Jurkat T cells, which express negligible CD25 at baseline. We found that 24\u2009h following treatment with CD25 CRISPRa-LNP X, there was an increase in surface CD25 expression in up to 29.6\u2009±\u20098.6% of Jurkat T cells, while minimal to no background expression of CD25 was observed with scrambled gRNA (scr) CRISPRa-LNP X (Fig. 4b and Fig. S8a). We demonstrated a similar level of potency in non-stimulated primary CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative donors, yielding a significant increase in cells expressing CD25 from 8.7\u2009±\u20090.7% with scr CRISPRa-LNP X to 14.6\u2009±\u20090.9% after 72\u2009h treatment with 800\u2009ng CD25 CRISPRa-LNP X per 105 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig. 4c and Fig. S8b).', 'We then extended the incubation time after a single dose of CD25 CRISPRa-LNP X, scr CRISPRa-LNP X or control mCherry-LNP X from 72\u2009h to 6 days. The percentage of cells expressing CD25 after 6 days was increased to 24.6\u2009±\u20095.1% of live cells (Fig. 4d and Fig. S8c), suggesting the peak response of CRISPRa-induced protein expression occurs later than 72\u2009h post-treatment. In contrast, the expression of mCherry was reduced at 6 days compared to 72\u2009h post-treatment (Fig. S8d, e), consistent with transient expression of LNP-mediated delivery of exogenous mRNA. The enhanced CD25 expression at day 6 was therefore likely not the result of increased expression of the CRISPRa machinery (dCas9-VP64 and MS2-p65-HSF1) at day 6, rather the extended incubation is required to capture the translation of the induced CD25 mRNA and its trafficking to the cell surface. Importantly, these findings confirm, the first to our knowledge, successful delivery of the dCas9-SAM CRISPRa machinery to non-stimulated T cells in vitro.', 'Finally, to generate HIV LTR-targeted CRISPRa-LNP X, we designed four MS2-p65-HSF1 recruiting hairpin-modified gRNAs (B, C, L and O) targeting different HIV LTR regions upstream of the transcription start site based on previous work23,40 (Fig. 5a, Table S1 and S2). We found that all four HIV LTR-targeting gRNAs, compared to a scrambled gRNA, could induce GFP expression in J-Lat 10.6 cells (Fig. 5b). To assess the potency of HIV LTR-targeting CRISPRa-LNP X ex vivo, we treated CD4+ T cells from ART-suppressed people living with HIV for 72\u2009h with an equivalent dose of 200\u2009ng CRISPRa-LNP X per 105 cells, analogous to what we used to deliver Tat mRNA. We used CRISPRa-LNP X co-encapsulating a 1:1 mass ratio of gRNA L and gRNA O (L\u2009+\u2009O CRISPRa-LNP X), which was found to exceed the potency of either gRNA alone (Fig. S9) and was hypothesised to increase the sequence coverage of HIV subtype B LTR sequences, the most common subtype in our cohort. L\u2009+\u2009O CRISPRa-LNP X treatment significantly increased all measured HIV transcripts except multiply-spliced Tat-Rev (Fig. 5c-g and Fig. S10a–e). The potency of latency-reversal was lower compared to Tat-LNP X treatment, with a maximum fold-increase over non-treated of 2.0 (IQR 0.87-3.39) for Pol transcripts, and did not exceed that of PMA/PHA treatment. No HIV transcripts were upregulated after treatment with a scrambled gRNA CRISPRa-LNP X, indicating the activation of transcription was gRNA-mediated. Treatment with HIV LTR-targeted CRISPRa-LNP X resulted in minimal toxicity, similar to treatment with Tat- or mCherry-LNP X, and did not result in generalised cellular activation (Fig. 5h and Fig. S10f–h), demonstrating the specificity of CRISPRa-LNP X as a next-generation LRA. However, treatment with L\u2009+\u2009O CRISPRa-LNP X did not lead to an induction of supernatant HIV RNA, as a measure of virion release (Figs. 5i and S10i).', 'a Schematic overview of the CRISPRa system targeting the HIV LTR.

Here, we explored the use of LNPs to enable therapeutic mRNA delivery to primary T cells, including CD4+ T cells latently infected with HIV. We reported an LNP formulation that is based on a combination of SM-102 and β-sitosterol. This LNP X reached transfection efficiencies of >75% in primary CD4+ T cells. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of successful, non-toxic in vitro transfection of primary T cells in the absence of T cell pre-stimulation, which was previously thought a pre-requisite for efficient LNP transfection41. Our data suggest that the superior potency of LNP X is due to increased cellular association as well as an increased efficiency of mRNA translation after delivery to the cytosol, contrasting with earlier hypotheses that β-sitosterol enhanced the efficiency of endosomal escape31. Together, these findings identify LNP X as a promising in vitro transfection tool that has the potential to replace nucleofection or viral transduction in the development of therapeutics for a range of T cell-implicated diseases or the generation of T cell-based immunotherapies. Furthermore, our data justify exploring LNP X for delivering nucleic acid cargo to other hard-to-transfect cell types.', 'We here used LNP X to address the need for more potent, HIV-specific latency-reversing agents, in order to deplete the latent HIV reservoir and contribute to virologic control off ART3. Combined with an mRNA expressing the 72 amino acids of the first coding exon of HIV Tat, LNP X was able to overcome all blocks in HIV transcription initiation and RNA processing with striking potency, exceeding the viral reactivation achieved by stimulation with a general T cell mitogen. Tat-LNP X showed a greater ability to reverse HIV latency than previously reported Tat-LNPs21,22,42. The lack of disclosure of the LNP formulation and uncertainty of the full biological properties of the Tat66 isoform used in the previously mentioned work means that direct comparisons of both Tat-LNPs were not possible. However, we hypothesise the superiority of our Tat-LNP X is primarily based on the high efficiency of mRNA delivery by LNP X, consistent with sub-optimal transfection efficiency of previously reported Tat-LNP21. Interestingly, the high level of latency reversal by Tat-LNP X appeared insufficient to drive virus-mediated cytotoxicity ex vivo, consistent with latently infected cells overexpressing pro-survival proteins such as B-Cell Lymphoma (BCL)-243,44 and BIRC-545. These findings highlight the need to combine latency reversal with additional interventions to sensitise infected cells to death or enhance immune-mediated clearance3,9,46. Furthermore, single-cell or limiting-dilution assays will be required to assess the ability of Tat-LNP X to uniformly induce HIV transcription across the breadth of the HIV reservoir, including cells harbouring proviruses in a deep quiescent state47,48. We showed that LNP X could co-encapsulate and deliver CRISPRa machinery, including a large dCas9-VP64 mRNA. One limitation of our study was that the delivery efficiency of the three CRISPRa RNA components was not individually assessed. Direct analysis of the efficiency and kinetics of delivery of various RNA cargo, as well as their respective half-lives once delivered, are likely to be key in further optimisation of the CRISPR activation potency in primary cells49. Nonetheless, the potency of CRISPRa-LNP X is a promising indication that LNP X could be used to deliver other CRISPR variants to T cells, such as CRISPR-Cas9 to excise the integrated HIV provirus50,51, or knock out CCR5 as the HIV entry receptor52.', 'Our current results did not indicate any in vitro toxicity induced by treatment with LRA-LNP X, nor any signs of cellular activation. However, an in-depth analysis of changes to the cellular transcriptome or metabolome is warranted in further investigations into Tat or CRISPRa as an HIV-specific latency-reversing agent. To explore the potential of LNP X for in vivo therapeutics, studies assessing the immunogenicity, biodistribution and half-life in circulation will be required, as well as dose-finding and safety studies to determine the optimal therapeutic dose. Prior studies that administered LNP intravenously in people have shown that 0.1 – 0.6\u2009mg/kg of mRNA was well-tolerated in humans2,53,54. Future work exploring the potential to specifically target LNP X to T cells through ligand-mediated targeting could further contribute to the therapeutic potential of LNP X in vivo.', 'Blood samples from people living with HIV were collected through leukapheresis at the Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) (USA) with informed consent and under institutional guidelines. People living with HIV included in these studies were aged 18 years or older and on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART) (viral load <50 copies/mL) for ≥3 years. The use of these samples was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at the Alfred Hospital, the University of Melbourne, and the Institutional Review Board at UCSF.', 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation of buffy coats (Australian Red Cross Lifeblood) or whole blood collected through leukapheresis. CD4+ T-cells were isolated from PBMCs using the EasyStepTM Human CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies), following manufacturer’s instructions, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. After thawing, CD4+ T cells were rested overnight prior to treatment and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS; Cellsera Australia), 100\u2009U/mL penicillin, 100\u2009µg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (all Thermo Fisher Scientific) (RF10) and 10\u2009U/mL interleukin-2 (IL-2; Sigma-Aldrich). J-Lat A2 (RRID:CVCL_1G43) and J-Lat 10.6 cells (RRID:CVCL_8281)55 were cultured in RF10 media. Cell lines and primary cells were maintained in a 37\u2009oC humified incubator with 5% CO2.', 'For studies comparing LNP X potency to benchmark LNP formulation (Fig. 1, Fig. S1), CleanCap® mCherry mRNA containing 5-methoxyuridine base modifications was obtained from TriLink Biotechnologies (L-7203). All other studies were performed with codon-optimised, capped, N1-methylpseudouridine base-modified mCherry mRNA purchased from Messenger Bio (Melbourne, Australia). Reporter mRNA encoding mScarlet was synthesised using in vitro transcription from codon-optimised PCR template using HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs), replacing all uridine with N1-methylpseudouridine (TriLink Biotechnologies). mRNA was co-transcriptional capped using CleanCap Reagent AG (TriLink Biotechnologies) and cleaned up by cellulose to remove dsRNA. AF488-oligo (5’-AF488AGA GTT CCC AAG ACC AGG CGG-3’) and Cy5-oligo (5’-Cy5AGA GTT CCC AAG ACC AGG CGG-3’) were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies. SNAPswitch-labelled oligo was synthesised by conjugating SNAPswitch-azide (ADKL Labs) to DBCO-oligo (5’-TCA GTT CAG GAC CCT CGG CTDBCO-3’) (TriLink Biotechnologies) as described previously33. Codon-optimised mRNAs encoding dCas9-VP64 (MW: 1528\u2009kDa) and MS2-p65-HSF1 (MW: 562.6\u2009kDa) were produced by Messenger Bio using previously published sequences39. mRNA expressing the 72 amino acids of the first coding exon of HIV Tat was designed following the NL4-3 reference sequence and produced by Messenger Bio (MW: 177.7\u2009kDa). All custom-designed mRNAs purchased from Messenger Bio included N1-methylpseudouridine base modifications. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using previously described spacer sequences targeting the HIV LTR23,40 (Table S1) or CD25 (IL2RA) (5’-TTATGGGCGTAGCTGAAGAA-3’)56 and a CRISPRa gRNA scaffold containing two MS2 hairpin aptamers, as described previously39 (Table S1). gRNAs were obtained from Integrated DNA technologies using custom IDT Alt-RTM gRNA synthesis, containing two 2’O-methyl base and phosphorothioate bond modifications at the 5’ and 3’ end of the gRNA (MW: 52.0\u2009kDa).', 'Lipid nanoparticles were assembled using the ionisable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (HY-112251, MedChemExpress) or SM-102 (33474, Cayman Chemical Company), DSPC (850365P, Avanti Polar Lipids), Cholesterol (C3045, Sigma-Aldrich) or β-sitosterol (700095P, Sigma-Aldrich), and DMG-PEG2000 (880151P, Avanti Polar Lipids). Lipids were reconstituted at 10\u2009mM in ethanol and mixed at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 of DLin-MC3-DMA:DSPC:Cholesterol:DMG-PEG2000 or SM-102:DSPC:β-sitosterol:DMG-PEG2000 for patisiran LNPs and LNP X, respectively. Immediately prior to mixing, RNA was diluted to 150\u2009ng/μL in 30\u2009mM RNAse-free sodium acetate buffer, pH4.0. For CRISPRa-LNPs, RNA components were mixed at a mass ratio of 0.8:0.00625:1 of dCas9-VP64 mRNA: MS2-p65-HSF1 mRNA: gRNA, corresponding to a molar ratio of 0.027:0.00058:1. LNPs were synthesised using a NanoAssemblr Spark (Precision NanoSystems) whereby the aqueous (RNA) and organic (lipid) phases were mixed at a flow rate ratio of 1.8 (aqueous): 1 (organic), with an N/P ratio of 6:1. These formulation parameters are summarised in Table S3. The LNP size and polydispersity were analysed through dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Ultra (Malvern Panalytical). RNA encapsulation efficiency and total RNA concentration of the LNP formulations were determined using a Quant-itTM RiboGreen RNA Assay as per the manufacturer’s low-range assay protocol (Invitrogen). Total RNA concentrations were used to dose LNPs throughout. For endosomal escape studies (Fig. 2), LNPs encapsulating a mixture of 95:5 (mass ratio) mScarlet mRNA and either SNAPswitch/AF488-labelled or Cy5/AF488-labelled oligos were synthesised using a NanoAssemblr Benchtop as described previously33.', 'To activate CD4+ T cells prior to transfection, cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; BioLegend) and 2\u2009µg/mL of soluble anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, Biolegend) for 72\u2009h. In all studies using HIV-negative CD4+ T cells, 100,000 cells were treated with indicated doses of patisiran LNPs or LNP X in a total culture volume of 200\u2009µL of RF10 with 10\u2009U/ml IL-2. After 72\u2009h, cells were stained using the LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and fixed prior to read-out. To identify CD4+ T cell subsets, the following antibodies were used: FITC anti-human CD3 (Clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences), BUV805 anti-human CD4 (Clone SK3, BD Biosciences), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-human CD45RA (Clone HI100, BioLegend), APC/Cy7 anti-human CCR7 (Clone C043H7, BioLegend) and BV711 anti-human CD27 (Clone L128, BD Biosciences). For CD25 activation experiments, non-stimulated CD4+ T cells were incubated with CRISPRa-LNPs for either 72\u2009h or 6 days and additionally stained with PE/Cyanine7 anti-human CD25 (Clone BC96; BioLegend). mCherry expression, CD25 expression and cell viability were assessed by flow cytometry using an LSRFortessaTM (BD Biosciences). To assess the tropism and specificity of LNP X, PBMCs from HIV-negative donors were plated at 300,000 cells in 100\u2009µL of RF10 and treated with 200\u2009ng mScarlet-LNP X for 24\u2009h. PBMC cell subsets and the expression of mScarlet was determined by flow cytometry using the following antibodies: FITC anti-human CD14 (Clone M5E2, BD Biosciences), APC/Cy7 anti-human CD56 (Clone HCD56, BioLegend), BUV395 anti-human CD3 (Clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences), BUV805 anti-human CD8 (Clone SK1, BD Biosciences), BV510 anti-human CD19 (Clone HIB19, BioLegend), BV650 anti-human HLA-DR (Clone G46-6, BD Biosciences), BV785 anti-human CD16 (Clone 3G8, BioLegend), PE/Cy7 anti-human CD4 (Clone OKT4, BioLegend).', 'LNP association, cytosolic delivery and expression of mRNA and endosomal escape efficiency of LNPs were determined in Jurkat T cells as described previously33. In brief, SNAP-actin expressing Jurkat T cells were treated with 100\u2009ng mScarlet/SNAPswitch oligo-LNPs per 100,000 cells for 4\u2009h. Background-corrected geometric mean fluorescence was measured using an Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek) to assess LNP association (AF488), cytosolic delivery (SNAPswitch) and mRNA expression (mScarlet). To determine endosomal escape efficiency, the cytosolic delivery observed with the SNAPswitch-LNPs was compared to a reference LNP containing an unquenched Cy5-labelled oligo, representing an endosomal escape efficiency of 100%.', 'J-Lat A255 (ARP-9854) and J-Lat 10.655 (ARP-9849) cells were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Programme, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. Cells were plated at 100,000 cells per well and treated with Tat-, mCherry- or CRISPRa-LNP X in a total culture volume of 100 μL RF10. For assessment of the optimal ratio of gRNA and CRISPRa mRNA components, LNPs containing either gRNA L, gRNA scr, dCas9-VP64 mRNA, or MS2-p65-HSF1 mRNA alone were used. For assessment of multiplexed gRNA delivery, CRISPRa-LNP X containing either gRNA L, gRNA O, or a combination of gRNA L and gRNA O (co-encapsulated at a 1:1 mass ratio) and CRISPRa mRNA components were used. J-Lat cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 16\u2009nM, Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (500\u2009nM, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive controls. After 24\u2009h, cells were stained with LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reactivation of LTR-mediated transcription was measured by quantifying GFP expression using flow cytometry.', 'CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative donors were spinoculated with pMorheus-V535 at a TCID50 unit per cell of 0.005 in RF10 supplemented with 10\u2009U/mL IL-2. pMorpheus-V5 is a single-round virus that harbours an mCherry reporter construct under the control of the HIV LTR promotor, allowing for the identification of productively infected cells undergoing LTR-mediated transcription. After 3 days, virus was aspirated and cells were seeded in fresh RF10 supplemented with 10\u2009U/mL IL-2, then treated with 16\u2009nM of PMA plus 500\u2009nM ionomycin, 2 μg Tat-LNP X per million cells or 0.1% DMSO in a final culture volume of 1\u2009mL per million cells. After a further 48\u2009h, the levels of productive HIV infection were determined by quantifying mCherry expression within live cells.', 'PBMCs from people living with HIV on suppressive ART were thawed, after which CD4+ T cells were isolated using using the EasyStepTM Human CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies), following manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated CD4+ T cells were rested overnight in RF10 containing 10\u2009U/mL of IL-2 and 1\u2009µM of Raltegravir. 2\u2009×\u2009106 cells were then treated with 4\u2009µg of LNPs at a concentration of 4\u2009µg/mL, or 10\u2009nM of PMA and 10\u2009µg/mL of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) as a positive control. After 72\u2009h, cells were separated from supernatant using centrifugation. Supernatant HIV RNA was quantified by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) using the Alinity m HIV-1 assay (Abbott) as previously described57. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit and anti-CD25 (Clone BC96, BioLegend), Brilliant Ultra VioletTM 395 anti-CD69 (Clone FN50, Invitrogen) and FITC anti-HLA-DR (Clone L243, Invitrogen). Cell viability and the expression of cellular activation markers were assessed using flow cytometry. To quantify the induction of HIV transcripts, RNA was extracted using polyacryl carrier enriched TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. TAR levels were quantified by 3-step polyadenylation-RT-dPCR, whilst Long-LTR, Pol, PolyA and Tat-Rev transcripts were quantified by 2-step RT-dPCR using the QIAcuity Four 5-plex digital PCR system (Qiagen), as previously described36. HIV RNA copies were normalised to RNA input. To quantify changes to the size of the proviral reservoir, cells were treated with Tat-LNP X for 120\u2009h. DNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Intact, 5’ defective and 3’ defective HIV DNA was quantified using Qiagen’s QIAcuity Four 5-plex digital PCR targeting parts of the psi and env region, as previously described58. The RPP30 host gene was used to measure the analysed number of cells and the DNA shearing index (DSI) as an indication of DNA fragmentation. The number of HIV copies was corrected to DSI and normalised to cell input.', 'Statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad Prism 10. A Student’s t test or ratio paired t test was used to compare two groups for primary cell transfection experiments involving uninfected cells or cells infected in vitro with pMorpheus-V5. For ex vivo experiments using CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV, a one-sided (for induction of HIV RNA) or two-sided (for changes to intact proviral DNA levels) Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare treatment conditions with untreated or positive controls.', 'Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.', 'Source data are provided for all experimental results presented in the main manuscript and supplementary information.

UVA researchers discover key to HIV latency and reactivation,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250529/UVA-researchers-discover-key-to-HIV-latency-and-reactivation.aspx,"['', 'University of Virginia School of Medicine scientists have uncovered a key reason why HIV remains so difficult to cure: Their research shows that small changes in the virus affect how quickly or slowly it replicates, and how easily or stubbornly it can reawaken from hiding. These insights bring researchers closer to finding ways to flush out the dormant virus and eliminate it for good.', 'Thanks to remarkable progress in HIV treatment, the virus can often be suppressed to undetectable levels in the blood, eliminating most disease symptoms, and preventing transmission to others. But HIV never truly goes away. Instead, it hides in the body in a dormant, or ""latent,"" state, and if medications are ever stopped it can reemerge. In this stealth mode, the virus evades both antiretroviral drugs and the immune system, posing one of the biggest challenges to finding a cure.', 'HIV treatment is lifesaving but also lifelong. Understanding how the virus stays latent in cells could help us develop a lasting cure for HIV.""', 'Patrick Jackson, MD, one of the two lead authors on the paper', ""UVA's new findings reveal a critical clue to how HIV controls this hiding act. The research shows that subtle variations in a viral control system, known as the Rev-RRE axis, influence how efficiently the virus replicates and how easily it reactivates from latency. Some versions of this system make the virus more aggressive, while others keep it less active and harder to bring out of hiding for elimination. "", '""Early on many scientists thought that the Rev-RRE axis was merely an on-off switch for the virus. However, our recent studies have shown that it functions more like a rheostat,"" said Marie-Louise Hammarskjold, MD, PhD, associate director of UVA\'s Myles H. Thaler Center for AIDS and Human Retrovirus Research in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology.', '""We\'ve known for some time that the Rev-RRE axis varied in activity,"" said David Rekosh, PhD, director of the center. ""This study links it directly to how well the virus can replicate and re-activate from latency.""', ""To replicate, HIV must export its RNA – its cellular operating instructions – from the nucleus of infected cells. It does this using a coordinated system involving a viral protein called Rev and a special RNA structure called the Rev Response Element, or RRE. UVA's new research shows that small changes in this regulatory system directly impact HIV's ability to replicate and emerge from latency. The study found that viruses with low Rev activity had a disadvantage in both replication and latency reactivation. "", 'This variability helps explain why HIV persists despite aggressive treatment. To develop a cure, future therapies may need to account for these subtle variations that allow the virus to shift its behavior, the researchers say.', '""Rev has often been overlooked in the context of latency, even though it\'s essential for HIV replication. Our work helps explain why some current \'shock and kill\' approaches struggle to fully reactivate the virus,"" said Godfrey Dzhivhuho, PhD, the other lead author of the study. ""If a portion of the viral reservoir has low Rev-RRE activity, it will be more resistant to reactivation. By enhancing the Rev-RRE axis, we may be able to induce a stronger and more complete latency reversal and bring us closer to strategies that can truly clear the virus.""', ""Dzhivhuho first met Rekosh and Hammarskjold years ago when they were teaching summer sessions at the University of Venda in South Africa, a country where more than 8 million people live with HIV. He later obtained his PhD in HIV immunology from the University of Cape Town and now devotes his career to better understanding HIV and other infectious diseases as part of UVA's Thaler Center."", '""Coming from South Africa, where HIV affects so many lives, I\'ve always wanted to be part of the effort to end this epidemic,"" Dzhivhuho said. ""I hope this work brings us one step closer to a cure, not just by uncovering how the virus works, but by helping design smarter strategies to finally eliminate it. That\'s what drives me every day in this research.""', 'The researchers have published their findings in the scientific journal PLOS Pathogens. The research team included Godfrey A.
