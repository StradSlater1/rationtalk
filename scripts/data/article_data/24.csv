EV Outlook: China Races Ahead,https://www.energyintel.com/Webinar/ev-outlook-china-races-ahead,"['EVs are set to continue growing rapidly through 2040, spurred by ever-cheaper batteries. China will continue to lead, followed by Europe, according to Energy Intelligence’s latest forecast. Stellar sales in China have prompted us to revise up our sales forecast, which should offset headwinds elsewhere. We model three EV sales scenarios, covering five major auto markets: China, Europe, the US, Japan and South Korea. In our revised Core scenario, sales are projected to hit ~80% by 2040, leading to almost 46% of the LDV fleet being electrified. In all three scenarios, the total ICE vehicle fleet in these key markets is forecast to peak by 2027.', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVVPVE5JYWw5QmFEYzNZVmQ0VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhTkJKQUhEZ3c=-w280-h168-p-df

This growth outpaced the overall auto market, which saw an 8% YoY increase. Consequently, EV market penetration rose slightly to 53%.', 'In contrast, BYD (SZ:002594), a major player in the Chinese EV market, saw a 4% month-on-month (MoM) decline in domestic sales volume. This drop lagged behind the 8% MoM growth of the overall EV market, leading BYD to initiate a discount campaign.

Tesla, under the ever-visible hand of Elon Musk, was not just a carmaker; it was a cultural phenomenon. Its futuristic vehicles, soaring stock price and aggressive global expansion painted a picture of a company far ahead of its competitors. ', 'China, then Tesla’s second-largest market after the United States, seemed like fertile ground for further conquest.', 'Five years later and the global EV landscape has changed somewhat.', 'While Tesla remains a powerful player in the EV market, its star has dimmed, particularly in China, today the world’s largest EV market and increasingly its most competitive. Once considered Tesla’s great growth engine, China has instead become a cautionary tale in how quickly fortunes can reverse, especially when local competitors start playing not just catch-up, but leapfrog.', 'China’s EV ascent', 'Much of the shift can be attributed to the meteoric rise of China’s domestic EV industry. In 2020, Chinese manufacturers such as BYD, NIO, Xpeng and Wuling were largely seen as producing budget-friendly alternatives to Western brands. Their offerings were often limited in range, design and prestige. But these were not signs of weakness; rather, they reflected a deliberate first phase of market entry: a concept across so many sectors that the world fails time and time again to recognise – that China plays the long game.', 'As such, today Chinese EV firms are no longer just building affordable city cars. They are designing, engineering and selling high-performance, premium vehicles that rival and, in many cases, exceed what Western firms like Tesla offer. In areas such as battery technology, AI-powered driving assistants and integration with domestic digital ecosystems, Chinese firms are leading the charge.', 'On the back of this, BYD has emerged not only as China’s dominant EV producer but as a global titan. The company, which famously pivoted from producing traditional combustion vehicles to focusing exclusively on EVs and hybrids, now outsells Tesla in pure EV volume in some quarters and has established a significant export footprint, with growing demand in Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America.', 'A market that outgrew its guest', 'Tesla’s early success in China was built on brand prestige, technology allure and the novelty factor. But prestige is fragile, especially in a market as discerning and fast-moving as China’s.', 'To this end, over the past two years, Tesla’s brand image in China has suffered a series of blows. Quality complaints, perceived arrogance in public relations, safety incidents and CEO Elon Musk’s often polarising global persona have all contributed to a cooling of enthusiasm. His relationship with President Donald Trump doesn’t help either. ', 'More recently, Tesla has struggled to respond nimbly to a market defined by ultra-fast innovation cycles and deep local understanding; areas where Chinese firms now have a decisive edge.', 'Moreover, Chinese EVs are now deeply integrated into the country’s digital infrastructure. Voice assistants tuned to China’s many local dialects, seamless payment and entertainment integration via WeChat and battery swap stations tailored to city planning make many local EVs feel more “Chinese” in the best sense – intuitive, smart and culturally aligned.', 'Policy, scale and ambition', 'The rise of China’s EV industry is not solely the result of consumer preference though. A robust and consistent industrial policy has helped turbocharge the sector’s development. Government subsidies, mandates on EV quotas, infrastructure investment and a focus on domestic battery supply chains have all helped Chinese firms scale rapidly and innovate boldly.', 'The result is a domestic EV market that no longer needs Tesla to feel like it’s in the future. ', 'In fact, Tesla often seems slightly behind the curve in China and elsewhere in East Asia, particularly when compared with newer Chinese models boasting features like in-car karaoke lounges, retractable dashboards or augmented-reality windshields.', 'Even more strikingly and key to the long-term survival of firms like BYD, Chinese automakers are no longer content to dominate at home. BYD, NIO, Geely (through its Zeekr and Polestar brands) and others are rapidly expanding into overseas markets, often with a more adaptable and locally sensitive approach than Tesla has ever taken.', 'In Southeast Asia Chinese EV brands are aggressively courting governments and consumers, offering affordable vehicles backed by strong aftersales networks and infrastructure partnerships. In Europe, Chinese EVs are increasingly seen not as curiosities but as serious contenders to local brands even if regulatory and trade tensions are beginning to mount.', 'Tesla’s narrowing road', 'None of this is to suggest that Tesla is doomed but its grip on the narrative of the EV future is loosening, especially in Asia.', 'In China, Tesla has gone from being an object of aspiration to a less distinctive choice. It is now just one among many. And in an EV landscape that is becoming more diverse, more competitive and more locally attuned, that lack of distinction could prove fatal.', 'The new vanguard', 'China’s transformation from EV underdog to global trendsetter, meanwhile, is perhaps one of the most significant shifts in the automotive industry in decades. What was once a Tesla-led global transition to electrification has become a more pluralistic, multipolar race. It is one where China now leads not just in volume, but in design, ambition and execution.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVVPVE5JYWw5QmFEYzNZVmQ0VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhTkJKQUhEZ3c=-w280-h168-p-df

China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8d4v69jw6o,"['Theo will be responding to reader comments about this article between 12pm and 1pm today. Go to the comments section at the bottom of this page to share what you think about the rise of these more affordable EVs.', 'In China, they call it the Seagull, and it has looks to match. It is sleek and angular, with bright, downward-slanting headlights that have more than a hint of mischievous eyes about them.', ""It is, of course, a car. A very small one, designed as a cheap city runabout – but it could have huge significance. Available in China since 2023, where it has proved extremely popular, it has just been launched in Europe with the name Dolphin Surf (because Europeans apparently aren't as keen on seagulls as Chinese people)."", ""When it goes on sale in the UK this week, it's expected to have a price tag of around £18,000. That will still make it, for an electric car on western markets, very cheap indeed."", ""It won't be the outright lowest-priced model on offer: the Dacia Spring, manufactured in Wuhan jointly by Renault and Dongfeng, and the Leapmotor T03, which is being produced by a joint venture between Chinese startup Leapmotor and Stellantis, both cost less."", 'But the Dolphin Surf is the invasive species that has long-established brands most worried. That is because the company behind it has been making ever bigger waves on international markets.', ""BYD is already the biggest player in China. It overtook Tesla in 2024 to become the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs), and since entering the European markets two years ago, it has expanded aggressively."", '""We want to be number one in the British market within 10 years,"" says Steve Beattie, sales and marketing director for BYD UK.', 'BYD is part of a wider expansion of Chinese companies and brands that some believe could change the face of the global motor industry – and which has already prompted radical action from the US government and the EU.', 'It means once-unknown marques like Nio, Xpeng, Zeekr or Omoda could become every bit as much household names as Ford or Volkswagen. They will join classic brands such as MG, Volvo and Lotus, which have been under Chinese ownership for years.', ""The products on offer already encompass a huge range, from runabouts like the tiny Dolphin Surf to exotic supercars, like the pothole-jumping U9, from BYD's high-end sub-brand Yangwang."", '""Chinese brands are making massive inroads into the European market,"" says David Bailey, professor of business and economics at Birmingham Business School.', 'In 2024, 17 million battery and plug-in hybrid cars were sold worldwide, 11 million of those in China. Chinese brands, meanwhile, had 10% of global EV and plug-in hybrid sales outside their home country, according to the consultancy Rho Motion. That figure is only expected to grow.', 'For consumers, it should be good news – leading to more high-quality and affordable electric cars becoming available. But with rivalry between Beijing and western powers showing no sign of subsiding, some experts are concerned Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk from hackers and third parties. And for established players in Europe, it represents a formidable challenge to their historic dominance.', '""[China has] a huge cost advantage through economies of scale and battery technology. European manufacturers have fallen well behind,"" warns Mr Bailey.', '""Unless they wake up very quickly and catch up, they could be wiped out.""', 'China\'s car industry has been developing rapidly since the country joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001. But that process accelerated rapidly in 2015, when the Communist Party introduced its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative. The 10-year plan to make the country a leader in several high-tech industries, including EVs, attracted intense criticism from abroad, and particularly the US, amid claims of forced technology transfers and theft of intellectual property – all of which the Chinese government denies.', 'Fuelled by lavish state funding, the plan helped lay the groundwork for the breakneck growth of companies like BYD – originally a maker of batteries for mobile phones – and allowed the Chinese parent companies of MG and Volvo, SAIC and Geely, to become major players in the EV market.', '""The general standard of Chinese cars is very, very high indeed,"" says Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK.', '""China has learned extremely quickly how to manufacture cars.""', 'Yet competition in China has become ever more cut-throat, with brands jostling for space in an increasingly saturated market. This has led them to hunt for sales elsewhere.', 'While Chinese firms have expanded into East Asia and South America, for years the European market proved a tough nut to crack – that is, until governments here decided to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models.', 'The transition to electric cars opened the door to new players.', '""[Chinese brands] have seen an opportunity to get a bit of a foothold,"" says Oliver Lowe, UK product manager of Omoda and Jaecoo, two sub brands of the Chinese giant Chery.', 'Low labour costs in China, coupled with government subsidies and a very well-established supply chain, have given Chinese firms advantages, their rivals have claimed. A report from the Swiss bank UBS, published in late 2023, suggested that BYD alone was able to build cars 25% more cheaply than western competitors.', 'Chinese firms deny the playing field is uneven. Xpeng\'s vice chairman Brian Gu told the BBC at the Paris Motor Show in 2024 that his company is competitive ""because we have fought tooth and nail through the most competitive market in the world"".', 'Concerns that Chinese EV imports could flood international markets at the expense of established manufacturers reached fever pitch in 2024.', 'In the US, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned they could prove to be an ""extinction-level event"" for the US industry, while the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen suggested that ""huge state subsidies"" for Chinese firms were distorting the European market.', 'The Biden administration took dramatic action, raising import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs from 25% to 100%, effectively making it pointless to sell them in the US.', 'It was condemned by Beijing as ""naked protectionism"".', 'Meanwhile, in October 2024, the EU imposed extra tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese-made EVs. The UK, however, took no action.', ""Matthias Schmidt, founder of Schmidt Automotive Research, says the EU's tariffs have now made it harder for Chinese firms to gain market share."", '""The door was wide open in 2024... but the Chinese failed to take their chance. With the tariffs in place, Chinese manufacturers are now unable to push their cost advantage onto European consumers.""', 'European manufacturers have been racing to develop their own affordable electric cars. French car-maker Renault is among them.', 'At its factory in Douai, in northeastern France, an army of spark-spitting robots weld sections of steel to form car bodies, while on the main assembly line, automated systems mate together bodyshells, doors, batteries, motors and other parts, before human workers apply the finishing touches.', 'The factory has been making cars for Renault since 1974, but four years ago, the ageing production lines were replaced with new highly automated, digitally-controlled systems.', 'Part of the site was also taken over by the Chinese-owned battery firm AESC, which built its own ""gigafactory"" next door.', 'It\'s part of Renault\'s wider plan to set up an ultra-modern EV ""hub"" in northern France. Mirroring the lean production techniques of Chinese manufacturers, the hub cuts costs by maximising efficiency and ensuring that suppliers are located as close as possible.', '""Our target was to be able to produce affordable electric cars here to sell in Europe,"" explains Pierre Andrieux, director of the Douai plant, arguing that automated processes ""will enable us to do that profitably"".', ""But the company is also exploiting something the Chinese brands do not have: heritage. Its latest model, the Renault 5 E-tech, built in Douai, borrows its name from one of the company's most famous products."", 'The original Renault 5, launched in 1972, was a quirky little everyman car with boxy looks and low running costs that became a cult classic.', 'The new design, despite being a state-of-the art EV, pays homage to its predecessor in name and appearance, in an effort to emulate its popular appeal.', 'But irrespective of how desirable Chinese cars are in comparison with European rivals, some experts believe we should be wary of them – for security reasons.', 'Most modern vehicles are internet-enabled in some way – to allow satellite navigation, for example – and drivers\' phones are often connected to car systems. Pioneered by Tesla, so-called ""over-the-air updates"" can upgrade a car\'s software remotely.', 'This has all led to concerns, in some quarters, that cars could be hacked and used to harbour spyware, monitor individuals or even be immobilised at the touch of a keyboard.', 'Earlier this year, a British newspaper reported that military and intelligence chiefs had been ordered not to discuss official business while riding in EVs; it was also alleged that cars with Chinese components had been banned from sensitive military sites.', 'Then in May, a former head of the intelligence service MI6 claimed that Chinese-made technology in a range of products, including cars, could be controlled and programmed remotely. Sir Richard Dearlove warned MPs that there was the potential to ""immobilise London"".', 'Beijing has always denied all accusations of espionage.', 'A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London says that the recent allegations are ""entirely unfounded and absurd"".', '""China has consistently advocated the secure, open, and rules-based development of global supply chains,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""Chinese enterprises operating around the world are required to comply with local laws and regulations.', '""To date, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Chinese EVs pose a security threat to the UK or any other country.""', 'Joseph Jarnecki, research fellow at defence and security think-tank The Royal United Services Institute, argues that potential risks can be mitigated.', '""Chinese carmakers exist in this highly competitive market. While they\'re beholden to Chinese law and that may require compliance with national security agencies, none of them want to damage their ability to grow and to have international exports by being perceived as a security risk,"" he says.', '""The Chinese government equally is conscious of the need for economic growth. They\'re not hell-bent on solely conducting surveillance.""', 'But the car industry is just one area in which Chinese technology is becoming increasingly enmeshed in the UK economy. To achieve the government\'s climate objectives, for instance, ""It will be necessary to use Chinese-supplied technology"", adds Mr Jarnecki.', 'He believes that regulators of key industries should be given sufficient resources to monitor cyber security and advise companies using Chinese products of any potential issues.', ""As for electric cars powered by Chinese technology, there's no question that they're here to stay."", '""Even if you have a car that\'s made in Germany or elsewhere, it probably contains quite a few Chinese components,"" says Dan Caesar.', '""The reality is most of us have smartphones and things from China, from the US, from Korea, without really giving it a second thought.

The other four models mentioned above are also included in the top five, though in a different finishing order.', 'According to Autovista24, the Model Y bounced back in March, following a particularly poor February. “However, it was not smooth sailing for the U.S. model,” the report notes. “Its 48,189-unit total (for the month of March) was up by just 0.6 percent year on year. Meanwhile, its 7.3 percent market share dropped 3.8 percentage points due to increased competition.” It looks like Tesla is still under siege, even in China.', 'And what about plug-in hybrids? Well, BYD absolutely dominates this market, with its products taking four of the top five spots in the first quarter. The top-selling model during this period was the Song Plus, with 58,300 sold, then comes the Qin L, Song Pro and Qin Plus. The Li Auto L6 rounded out the top five, with 44,347 being sold. As for the month of March, the top five vehicles are exactly the same, as is the finishing order.', 'The EU and China have begun negotiations that would eventually allow for the sale of Chinese EVs in Europe without tariffs.', 'China’s automotive industry is truly the wild, wild east. It’s interesting to see which models are selling the best over there because these are not products that are available in North America. Also, China is making some fascinating advances these days, particularly in the areas of battery technology and charging infrastructure. There are important reasons why motorists buy more electrified vehicles than any other country on the planet, and that is not likely to change anytime soon.', 'Drivers in China are buying battery-powered vehicles at a dizzying pace.', 'We want to hear from you!

China shifts gears on e-mobility,https://www.mobilityplaza.org/news/41528,"['From aggressive pricing to global expansion and grid integration, we explore how China’s evolving EV strategy is reshaping the global landscape, international partnerships, and infrastructure transformation.', 'It’s no secret that China has become the most influential force in the electric vehicle (EV) market—driven by a dynamic domestic industry and an expanding global presence. The country’s strategy is now entering a pivotal new phase, characterized by aggressive pricing, strategic partnership and energy resilience aimed at maintaining its dominance as EV sales are projected to exceed 40% of the global car market by 2030.', 'BYD’s strategic intent', ""The Chinese e-mobility landscape was jolted recently as shares of BYD, the country's largest EV manufacturer, plummeted by 8.6% following steep discounts across several of its models. The move has reignited fears of a renewed price war in the fiercely competitive market, especially amid persistent economic uncertainty and increasing geopolitical tensions with the United States. The pricing cuts, perceived as an aggressive attempt to clear swelling dealer inventories estimated at 150,000 units from January to April 2025, are also seen as a broader response to declining consumer demand."", 'Despite the market’s nervous reaction, industry analysts view BYD’s strategy as a calculated push to maintain its momentum both domestically and abroad. While the price reductions may pressure rivals to follow suit, they also reaffirm BYD’s intent to consolidate leadership in a market where affordability and production scale are becoming decisive factors.', 'Last year, international tensions escalated when the European Union (EU) imposed countervailing duties of up to 35.3% on imported EVs from China, in addition to the existing 10% import duty. More recently, the EU and China have initiated talks to potentially replace these tariffs  with a minimum pricing mechanism. The proposed shift aims to ease trade friction and create a more balanced competitive landscape, as China continues to export tens of thousands of EVs to the EU while exports from the EU to China remain comparatively stagnant.', 'Global influence', 'In 2024 alone, Chinese manufacturers exported close to 1.25 million EVs to markets around the world, including emerging economies where Chinese imports have helped lower retail EV prices. In Europe, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time in April, marking a major milestone as registrations of its battery-electric vehicles surged. Alongside its new plant in Brazil, BYD is also building a manufacturing facility in Hungary.', 'BYD remains less exposed to trade tensions and tariffs by avoiding the U.S. market, focusing instead on growth in Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe. According to a recent IEA report, this expansion is already showing positive momentum, despite logistical challenges related to charging infrastructure and the complexities of entering less mature EV markets.', 'Chinese automakers more broadly have been steadily embedding themselves into local mobility ecosystems. In Spain, Repsol recently signed a comprehensive collaboration agreement with Chery’s OMODA and JAECOO brands to support automotive decarbonization. Meanwhile, in Germany, the public transport sector is piloting fully autonomous services using vehicles from Nio and technology developed by Intel-owned Mobileye.', 'Powering the world’s largest EV market', 'As Chinese EV makers expand globally, the domestic landscape is being shaped by large-scale infrastructure efforts designed to future-proof the transition and address interoperability. Recent notable moves include a partnership between battery manufacturer CATL and energy giant Sinopec to develop a nationwide battery-swap network alongside the country’s plans to use EVs as mobile energy storage in nine cities to feed power back into the grid during peak demand periods.', 'Similar initiatives from XPENG and Volkswagen Group China, as well as from NIP and CATL, mark a shift toward a more collaborative EV ecosystem. These initiatives signal a shift from individual vehicle sales to ecosystem-based solutions aimed at making EV ownership more convenient, flexible, and energy-aware.', 'But with speed comes structural strain as oversaturation looms. China’s EV rollout has outpaced regulatory development, particularly in areas like battery recycling and grid integration. According to East Asia Forum, only 156 of more than 40,000 licensed firms are certified to process decommissioned EV batteries, with fewer than 0.4% of used batteries handled properly. To ease growing grid stress from rising EV demand, China is also pushing energy reforms, including unifying its six regional grids into a national electricity market and adopting spot trading mechanisms to improve responsiveness.', 'The cost of being an EV powerhouse', 'According to the Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance (EVCIPA), China had installed 12.82 million charging points by the end of 2024. However, this infrastructure remains unevenly distributed, with 69% concentrated in economically developed provinces and cities such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Beijing. This regional imbalance not only shapes access but also contributes to significant differences in charging costs across the country.', 'In 2023, prices at public charging stations in several cities rose sharply, with increases reaching up to 87% in some areas. As a result, charging costs climbed to around 1.5 yuan (aprox. $0.21) per kilowatt-hour in urban areas and 2 yuan (aprox. $0.28) in suburban areas. The surge was triggered by a policy change implemented on June 1, when the government reclassified electricity consumption at large charging stations as “industrial” use, making it subject to higher rates than those applied to “residential” electricity.', 'In addition, a comprehensive analysis of levelized costs of EV charging at the provincial level reveals stark geographical variations. While the national average cost is 0.973 RMB/kWh (aprox. $0.14/kWh) with home chargers and 1.148 RMB/kWh (aprox. $0.16/kWh) without, provinces like Xinjiang and Shanghai report cost differences of up to 147%, driven by disparities in electricity prices and usage intensity.', 'While Chinese automakers make inroads into foreign mobility ecosystems through exports and strategic partnerships, domestic priorities are shifting toward long-term resilience. Rising charging costs, regional price disparities, and evolving electricity policies are reshaping the economics of EV ownership within China, revealing that dominance in scale must be matched by affordability and accessibility. How the country manages this balancing act will determine not only its future dominance, but the trajectory of the global EV transition itself.', 'Related contents', 'When it comes to energy, China shoots in every direction', 'EU enforces final duties on Chinese electric vehicle imports', 'NIO opens charging network to MHERO', 'Discuss', '', '', '', '', 'Latest updates', ""Walmart unveils AI assistant 'Sparky'"", 'ULEMCo launches mobile hydrogen refuelling solution for construction', 'Kalibrate Fuel Pricing', 'Sell more fuel, at higher margin, for maximum profitability', 'Tesco powers up loyalty program with EV charging rewards', 'Love’s expands network with new locations in Illinois and Nevada', 'NEW - optimized Nozzle Body', 'ELAFLEX – ‘Composite Body’ for nozzles.\nSafe, reliable, ergonomic', 'Avalon receives Product of the Year 2025 award at Stacja Paliw', 'KÄRCHER - CONNECT.
