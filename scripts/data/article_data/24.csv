Europe has lowered NINE TIMES!” the president raged.', 'The jobs report from ADP comes two days ahead of the release of official numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which are expected to be much higher due to the different methods of calculation used by the two entities. BLS’s numbers are watched more closely by traders.', 'Meanwhile, the president’s reaction to the news closely followed his own early-morning all-caps boast on Truth Social that the US supposedly had “the best May in 30 years.”', 'The quick response by the president is a sign that his frustrations with Powell have not eroded at all. The White House reassured reporters and economists that the president was not considering Powell’s firing earlier this year after it was reported that Trump was talked down from doing so by two Cabinet officials.', 'He called the Federal Reserve chair a “major loser” in April and blamed him for insufficient interest rate cuts. Powell, in early May, joined other officials at the Fed in declaring the economy’s foundations solid while acknowledging that “risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.”', 'Like many, Powell linked those risks directly to the president’s imposition of 10 percent tariffs on all US imports and higher so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on many US trading partners.', '“It’s really not clear at all what we should do,” Powell told reporters at a press conference, adding that the tariffs could “generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment"".', '“For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” he added.', 'These statements unsurprisingly infuriated the president, who along with White House and Cabinet officials has fought back against analyses and predictions from economists suggesting that the US’s new trade barriers will slow economic growth and risk throwing the country into recession. Major retailers like Amazon added to those fears with public statements blaming the tariffs for price hikes on consumer goods.', 'At the same time, the president was faced with the news of the US dollar slipping to its lowest value in three years.', '“‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump wrote at the time. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation.”', '“With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” he continued. “Mr. Too Late” is apparently the president’s latest attempt at branding one of his perceived political enemies with a nickname.', '“Europe has already ‘lowered’ seven times,” Trump’s April rant about Powell continued. “Powell has always been ‘To Late,’ except when it came to the Election period when he lowered in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected. How did that work out?”', 'As the markets repeatedly reacted with fear in response to the president’s tariffs, the president has backed off on some of his bolder challenges. This week, he announced that the UK would be spared a planned 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. Last week, he delayed plans to impose 50% tariffs on all imports from the European Union after a call with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXBkbEJpWTJsaFlqRTBWMmh1VFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdZQk1vWXlGUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Inflation in the Euro area now hovers below the ECB’s target of 2% as the bloc has grown just 0.3% in the first quarter. Germany, typically the economic engine of the region, has contracted two years in a row, and trade tension could make matters worse. In general, E.U. growth has been hit by weaker energy prices, slower wage growth and a strengthening currency that have all put pressure on business activity.', 'By contrast, Goldman Sachs expects U.S. gross domestic product to expand by more than 3% in the second quarter.', 'If Trump has been frustrated so far, he may still hold some cards to implement more of his agenda — though it could involve relenting on some key issues.

Trump fumes at Jerome Powell after weak ADP jobs report,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-jerome-powell-fed-adp-jobs-report-interest-rates-rcna210961,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'President Donald Trump demanded Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lower interest rates, on the heels of an unofficial jobs report hitting its lowest level in over two years.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", '""ADP NUMBER OUT!!! \'Too Late\' Powell must now LOWER THE RATE. He is unbelievable!!!"" the president wrote Wednesday morning. The ""ADP number"" Trump refers to is the payroll processing firm\'s latest jobs report. According to ADP, in May private payrolls increased by just 37,000, the worst showing for any month since March 2023.', ""The president's citation of ADP's report, though, is curious."", 'Trump\'s post is the latest barrage in a long-running campaign to pressure Powell and the Fed to lower interest rates. It comes a week after he met with Powell for the first time since his second inauguration. According to a statement from the Fed after the meeting, Powell defended the central bank\'s independence from the president. ""Chair Powell did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy,"" the statement read, ""except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.""', ""The president's citation of ADP's report, though, is curious. The official May jobs report, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, comes out Friday morning, and the ADP report does not always match the government version. For example, BLS reported that employers added 177,000 jobs in April — nearly three times the 62,000 ADP reported at the time (and later revised down to 60,000). That gap isn't just a Trump-era phenomenon, either: One year ago, BLS reported nearly twice as many jobs added as ADP. If Trump hadn't called attention to ADP's latest report, it quite likely would have attracted little notice."", ""But perhaps the president's reaction to the ADP report reflects broader worries about his economic track record. Already, Trump's chaotic tariff policy has spooked markets; U.S. gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter, the first decline since 2022; consumer confidence has dropped; and consumer spending has slowed."", 'Job creation, however, has remained fairly stable — a bright spot for Trump so far. A weak official jobs report for May, though, would suggest trouble looming. ""It’s too soon to see the full effects of tariffs, DOGE, or other policies on the labor market,"" wrote economist Claudia Sahm, creator of the Sahm rule, a recession indicator. ""Softening now would suggest less resilience to those later effects, raising the odds of a recession.""', 'Trump\'s complaint will only heighten anticipation of the official May jobs report. In the meantime, the jobs market ""remains distressingly gridlocked, with limited hiring and low quits,"" Indeed economist Allison Shrivastava told CNBC earlier this week, ""and the market can’t keep steadily cooling off forever before it just turns cold.""', 'James Downie is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

But over the last few months, Trump has tried to publicly pressure Powell to lower interest rates, as the Fed did last year, though officials say that the economy – thrown into a tailspin from Trump’s trade war – has become too unstable to continue lowering rates.', 'After Trump’s “liberation day” in early April, when he announced a slate of tariffs that ended up crashing US stock markets, Trump wrote on social media: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly.”', 'Powell, who was appointed during Trump’s first term in 2018, has resisted the pressure from Trump and has warned that high tariffs could lead to inflation and, earlier in May, said that officials are “in no hurry” to cut interest rates – all statements that seem to have put Trump on edge.', '“‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue,” Trump wrote after the Fed’s meeting.', 'Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, though it’s unclear whether the president has the power to do so. Last week, the supreme court allowed Trump to follow through on his dismissal of officials on the National Labor Relations Board, the panel that oversees labor disputes, but judges noted that the Federal Reserve is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” – implying that it likely won’t be so easy for Trump to get rid of Powell.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXBkbEJpWTJsaFlqRTBWMmh1VFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdZQk1vWXlGUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Right now, those goals aren’t compatible.', 'Economists expect the Labor Department to report this morning that employers added 125,000 jobs last month. If the number exceeds expectations, it will be yet another sign of economic resilience despite the effects that Trump’s trade agenda, market convulsions and touch-and-go recession fears have had on sentiment. It would be great news for a White House that has reveled in recent positive economic data and has sparred with Wall Street heavyweights or reporters who spotlight the risks posed by the president’s agenda.', 'But it would also give Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell a case to hold rates higher for longer. Higher borrowing costs might help keep a lid on inflation — and further weaken rate-sensitive sectors like housing — until there’s greater clarity on how tariffs ultimately affect consumer prices. The Fed is scheduled to announce its interest rate decision on June 18.', 'Obviously, that’s not what Trump wants. The president used this week’s tepid private sector hiring report from the payroll processing firm ADP to lash out at the Fed chair — whom he’s nicknamed “TOO LATE” — and make a case for why he “must now LOWER THE RATE.”', 'And there are signs that the labor market is flagging. U.S. employers announced layoffs affecting nearly 94,000 positions last month — a 47 percent increase over April of last year, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Jobless claims for the week following the Memorial Day holiday jumped more than many economists had predicted, the government reported on Thursday. And the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing and service sector employment indices were both in contraction territory in May.', 'But if today’s jobs report disappoints — EY’s Gregory Daco sees job growth falling below 100,000 — it will be taken as a sign that Trump’s trade agenda is starting to wear on employers. While a softening labor market increases the likelihood that Powell accelerates the timeline for rate cuts, it would also suggest the economy is in much worse shape than anyone in the White House would like. Trump would then face more political pressure — from both Wall Street and industry — to dial back his protectionist trade policies.', 'Julien Lafargue, the chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, put it this way: “Anything below the 100,000 mark could reignite recession fears while a stronger-than-expected print could perversely be negative for risk assets as it would likely put upward pressure on yields.”', 'In other words, for Trump, the odds that he’ll get a Goldilocks economy and low rates — soon — look slim.

He did not discuss actions he expects to take, the Fed said. ', 'The Fed chair did, however, indicate that ""the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,"" the central bank added. ', 'He also stressed that monetary policy will support ""maximum employment and stable prices,"" referring to the Fed\'s dual mandate of keeping unemployment and inflation low.', ""At a press conference earlier this month, Powell emphasized that he's never requested a meeting with a U.S. president, and never would. "", '""I wouldn\'t do that,"" he said. ""There\'s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting; it\'s always been the other way."" Mr. Trump had not requested that they meet, Powell said at the time.', ""The meeting comes as ongoing tariff uncertainty clouds business and investment decisions. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs are illegal. However, the president is expected to keep pushing tariffs, which are already having an inflationary effect, as retailers raise consumer prices to offset added costs they are facing. "", 'Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to lower interest rates and even threatened to remove him from his post, writing in an April 17 social media post that Powell\'s ""termination cannot come fast enough.""', ""Powell has previously underlined the Fed's historical political independence, noting in December that the central bank's job is to make decisions based on economic data without regard to the views of elected officials.

Trump said the central bank should lower its influential fed funds rate by ""a full point,"" saying it would be economic ""Rocket Fuel!""\n1\n\n\nThe Fed adjusts its fed funds rate, which influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans, to keep inflation down and employment high.', ""Fed officials have kept their rate higher than usual so far this year in an effort to push inflation down to its goal of a 2% annual rate. Officials said they are waiting to see what happens in the economy because they are concerned Trump's tariffs could push up prices and set off a fresh round of inflation.\n\nThe Fed's cautious approach has angered Trump, who wants rate cuts and the economic growth they could promote.
