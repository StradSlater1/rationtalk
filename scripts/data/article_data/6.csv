Trump called it “a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation”.', 'CEOs from major companies including Michael Dell, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, and Vladimir Tenev of Robinhood committed billions for employees’ children’s accounts.

Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”', 'The program passed the House as part of a massive budget bill but faces stiffer Senate Republican resistance over the broader package. The accounts cannot be implemented as a standalone program and depend entirely on passage of what Trump calls the “one big, beautiful bill” that is “among the most important pieces of legislation in our country’s history”, claiming it’s “fully funded through targeted reforms” including welfare changes and a proposed remittance tax.', 'However, the congressional budget office last week found the bill would also add $2.4tn to the national debt over the next decade while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs. The CBO analysis showed the bill, which passed the House by a single vote and no Democratic support, would leave 10.9 million more Americans without healthcare by 2034.', 'The treasury-funded accounts, previously called “Maga accounts” resemble existing 529 college plans but with lower contribution limits – leading some financial advisers to say the Trump accounts may not offer the best investment incentives.', 'The move is also not without precedent: the United Kingdom operated a similar Child Trust Fund with government seed funding from 2002-2011 before discontinuing the program, while Singapore runs the Baby Bonus Scheme that includes government-matched savings accounts for children.', 'Trump was optimistic about returns, saying beneficiaries would “really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future”.', 'Johnson warned that failure to pass the legislation would result in “the largest tax increase in American history” and pushed for swift congressional action on what he called “pro-growth legislation” that would “help every single American”.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9iWEZhTmtoNFdqVXRZekZRVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdZaGc1Q3RPUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

The full balance would be available at age 30.', '""They\'ll really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future,"" Trump said at a June 9 event at the White House touting the legislation.', ""From gym memberships to gun silencers, Trump's tax bill is full of surprises"", 'House Republicans changed the name of the program from ""MAGA accounts"" to ""Trump accounts"" before the bill\'s passage last month, offering the president a tangible benefit for working-class Americans that he can put his stamp on.', ""The program also serves as a counter to Democratic arguments that the legislation that extends the GOP's 2017 tax cuts primarily helps the nation's wealthiest Americans.

Midterm elections have historically been unkind to the sitting president's political party, and Republicans have been sprinting to get their tax cut bill through quick enough to improve their political fortunes."", 'Ahead of Trump\'s event, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the bill would ""change the lives of working, middle class families across America"" through tax cuts, increasing the child tax credit, ""AND by creating this incredible new “\'Trump Account\' program, which will put the lives of young Americans on the right financial path!”', 'The House overcame a myriad of obstacles, coming from pockets of lawmakers in the GOP and a unified opposition from Democrat, to pass the lower chamber in late May.

Fewer than three Republicans can defect for the bill to pass. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, has said he's a no, and senators such as Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, have pushed to get the price tag down."", ""Republicans are aiming to get the bill through the Senate, approved again by the House and to Trump for his signature by July 4. But the president also echoed some GOP lawmakers in acknowledging that the party's self-imposed deadline could slip."", ""Donald Trump Airport? Trump on the $500 bill? Republicans can't stop honoring ex-president"", '""I\'ve encouraged my dear friends and colleagues over there don\'t modify it too much, because we\'ve got a very delicate balance that we\'ve reached and it took us a long time to get there. And we don\'t want to upset that balance too much,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson said during Trump\'s roundtable event at the White House. Johnson added: ""So they\'re putting their fingerprints on it. I think – I hope – it will be a light touch, and they\'ll send it back, and we\'ll get this thing done, and get it to the president\'s desk.""', ""Trump has been putting public and private pressure on lawmakers to vote for the bill.

This program, part of a larger tax bill, aims to give young Americans a financial head start. The accounts, previously known as ""MAGA Accounts"" or ""Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement,"" will be automatically opened by the Department of the Treasury for children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029.', 'Each account will receive an initial $1,000 deposit from the federal government. Parents and family members can contribute up to $5,000 annually. The funds in these accounts will grow tax-deferred, with qualified withdrawals taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. These withdrawals can be used for educational expenses, purchasing a first home, or starting a business.', 'According to CNBC, the accounts are designed to function similarly to custodial brokerage accounts, with funds invested and subject to market fluctuations. Unlike 529 plans, which offer tax-free withdrawals for educational expenses, Trump Accounts will still incur taxes on earnings, even for qualified uses.', 'The accounts will be tied up until the account holder turns 18, at which point they can withdraw up to 50% of the funds for qualified expenses. At age 25, they can access the full balance for the same purposes, and after age 30, the funds can be withdrawn for any reason.', 'The tax bill, including the Trump Accounts, has passed the House of Representatives but still faces potential revisions in the Senate. Republicans hope to deliver the bill to President Trump by July 4, despite concerns about its impact on the federal deficit.', 'iHeart', 'Live Radio', 'Podcasts', 'Artist Radio', 'News', 'Features', 'Events', 'Contests', 'Photos', 'About', 'Advertise', 'Blog', 'Brand Guidelines', 'Contest Guidelines', 'Subscription Offers', 'Jobs', 'Automotive', 'Home', 'Mobile', 'Wearables', '© 2025 iHeartMedia, Inc.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9iWEZhTmtoNFdqVXRZekZRVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdZaGc1Q3RPUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Trump Accounts takes that same principle and they apply it from the very beginning of Americans’ lives.”', 'The accounts will be private property controlled by the child’s guardians. Johnson added that the initiative could be a total game-changer for parents and their kids. One of the benefits of the program would be that a typical American family with two children would see their take-home pay increase by $13,300 a year.', '“It could be the difference,” he says. “It could pave the way for paying their way through college, buying their first home, or starting a business even when they’re young.”', 'Several business leaders — including those from Dell, Uber and Goldman Sachs — have announced billions of dollars in collective investments into “Trump Accounts” for the children of their employees.', '“We see the Invest America Act and the establishment of these Trump Accounts as a simple, yet powerful way to transform lives,” said Micheal Dell, Dell Technologies CEO. “Decades of research have shown that giving children a financial headstart profoundly impacts their long-term success.”', 'The accounts will begin at $1,000 per child, with the opportunity to contribute an additional $5,000 yearly throughout the child’s life.', 'Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

It would create accounts for all babies born in the U.S. over the next four years with $1,000 that would accrue interest until the children reach adulthood. At age 18, they could withdraw the money to put toward a down payment for a home, education or to start a small business.

Blake Moore, a Republican from Utah, spearheaded the effort to get the initiative into a massive House spending bill. In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, he said wealth inequality has soured many people on capitalism. “Trump Accounts,” as the proposal calls them, could be the antidote, he said.', '“We know that America’s economic engine is working, but not everyone feels connected to its value and the ways it can benefit them,"" Moore wrote. “If we can demonstrate to our next generation the benefits of investing and financial health, we can put them on a path toward prosperity.”', 'The bill calls for the money to be handled by investment firms.', 'The bill would require at least one parent to produce a Social Security number with work authorizations, meaning the U.S. citizen children born to some categories of immigrants would be excluded from the benefit. But unlike other baby bond programs, which generally target disadvantaged groups, this one would be available to families of all incomes.', ""“When little baby is born they’re gonna start off with a thousand dollars and if we do a good job of investing their money — we're going to go with one of the investing guidelines, who the hell knows if they're any good — but they have a chance to be very rich,” Trump said at a rally last week in Pittsburgh. “It's going to be very cute to see.”"", ""Video below: Republican support wanes over President Trump's agenda bill"", '', '', '', 'Economist Darrick Hamilton of The New School, who first pitched the idea of baby bonds a quarter-century ago, said the GOP proposal would exacerbate rather than reduce wealth gaps. He envisioned a program that would be universal but would give children from poor families a larger endowment than their wealthier peers, in an attempt to level the playing field. The money would be handled by the government, not by private firms on Wall Street.', ""“It is upside down,” Hamilton said. “It's going to enhance inequality.”"", 'Hamilton added that $1,000 — even with interest — would not be enough to make a significant difference for a child living in poverty.', 'A Silicon Valley investor who created the blueprint for the proposal, Brad Gerstner, said in an interview with CNBC last year that the accounts could help address the wealth gap and the loss of faith in capitalism that represent an existential crisis for the U.S.', '“The rise and fall of nations occurs when you have a wealth gap that grows, when you have people who lose faith in the system,” Gerstner said. “We’re not agentless.
