Five thousand ships and 13,000 aircraft. All to take a heavily fortified 50-mile stretch of French shoreline, a herculean effort to reclaim a critical part of Europe from the Nazis and turn the tide of the most horrific war the world had ever seen.', 'On June 6, 1944 − D-Day − World War II\'s invasion of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord, got underway. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, told the men as they mobilized for battle: ""The eyes of the world are upon you. ... The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.""', ""Tolley Fletcher, at the time a 19-year-old Navy gunner's mate, remembered the rough seas and the treacherous landing troops at Utah Beach had to make in 3- to 4-foot waves, each carrying about 60 pounds of gear on their backs and descending on rope ladders from larger ships onto smaller landing crafts."", '""I felt for those soldiers,"" Fletcher, now 100 years old, told USA TODAY. ""In my mind, that was the worst part, other than people getting hurt.""', 'Fletcher, who joined the Navy at 17 in late December 1941, said he and his shipmates were fortunate to be mostly out of the line of fire. ""There was some shelling, not really a lot, and luckily we didn\'t get hit.', '""Maybe halfway in, we started seeing lots of bodies in the water,"" said Fletcher, who now lives in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area. ""I was asked (later) what we did about it. We didn\'t do anything about it − we had a job: to escort those troops to the beach.""', 'On D-Day, ""that\'s what these guys faced,"" said Peter Donovan Crean Sr., vice president for education and access at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. ""They knew they were in the presence of history. Soldiers, sailors, Marines − they knew what they were doing was going to go down in history, which also meant they knew the danger involved.', '""Guys who were 18, 19, 20 years old were faced with the possibility of their death, but they did it anyway.""', ""As we mark the 81st anniversary of D-Day, here is a look at what happened on the beaches of Normandy, the men who fought knowing they might not survive to see victory and the way it affected the Allies' fight to defeat fascism, genocide and tyranny."", ""In order to defeat the Nazis in Europe, the Allies knew they'd have to take France, under German occupation since 1940. Operation Overlord saw a mobilization of 2,876,000 Allied troops in Southern England, as well as hundreds of ships and airplanes, in preparation for a ground invasion, the largest the world had seen."", ""Weighing conditions including the weather, disagreements among other military leaders and strategic uncertainty, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for the operation to begin before dawn on June 5, 1944. If things didn't go well for the Allies, Eisenhower wrote a note accepting responsibility. The following day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed along the 50-mile stretch of French shoreline."", 'More than 9,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded, and 100,000 troops would continue the slow, bloody journey to Berlin, the center of German power.', 'According to the U.S. Army, D-Day was ""simply an alliteration, as in H-Hour."" Some believe the first ""D"" also stands for ""day,"" a code designation, while the French say the ""D"" stands for ""disembarkation."" The Army\'s website says that ""the more poetic insist D-Day is short for \'day of decision.\'""', 'Asked in 1964, Eisenhower instructed his assistant Brig. Gen. Robert Schultz, to answer. Schultz wrote that ""any amphibious operation has a \'departed date\'; therefore the shortened term \'D-Day\' is used.”', 'D-Day was not the only decisive battle of the European theater, Crean said.', '""It was a crucial battle but there were more ahead,"" he said. ""They had 700 miles of tough road ahead to get to Berlin.""', 'The Battle of the Bulge, waged over 41 days in December 1944 and January 1945, required 700,000 Allied troops. ""It was a tough slog for another 11 months,"" Crean said.', ""Victory in Europe − V-E Day − would come on May 8, 1945, nearly a year after D-Day. The war wouldn't end until the Japanese surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945."", ""There are about 66,000 surviving World War II veterans in the United States, Crean said, and while that may sound like a lot, it's a tiny fraction of the 16.4 million who served their country in the conflict."", '""So to be able to talk to and thank one veteran now is a gift for any of us,"" Crean said.', 'The National World War II Museum\'s mission ""is more critical than ever ... so more people will understand what they did and continue to be inspired by their sacrifices,"" added Crean, a retired colonel with 30 years\' service in the Army.', 'The museum has had oral historians travel the country to record more than 12,000 personal stories from World War II veterans. They\'ve conducted extensive interviews with veterans, Holocaust survivors and homefront workers and, using artificial intelligence, created a way for visitors to have ""conversations"" with them and ask questions to learn about the war effort. And they offer virtual programming, teacher training and a student leadership award.', 'Fletcher, the Navy gunner\'s mate, said he\'s uncomfortable with the idea of being considered a hero. Asked about his role in history, he said, ""I really didn\'t think about it then, and I don\'t think about it now, though it\'s been impressed upon me quite a bit.', '""When I think about what I went through, and what all the Army and the other men who were mixed up in really tough situations, it makes me feel a little bit guilty.""']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNUlPV1I1Y1hCVGFsVXhObkpuVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

10 D-Day rumors we've fact-checked to mark 81st anniversary,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/06/06/remembering-d-day-81st-anniversary/,"[""Widely seen as a turning point in World War II, the June 6, 1944, invasion of Normandy, often referred to as D-Day, has long been the subject of viral rumors with varying levels of legitimacy. As the world marks its 81st anniversary, we revisit some of the most notable claims we've investigated about that historic day."", 'One pertains to a mysterious photograph that was widely shared on social media in 2021. According to its caption, half the image depicted paratroopers who landed in France in 1944, and the other half supposedly showed a modern image of them in the same airplane 65 years later. ', 'That caption was far from the truth. While it was possible some of the men on the left parachuted into France on D-Day decades before that photograph was taken, they were not the same men as those pictured in the accompanying black-and-white image.', 'Another popular online photograph was said to show Red Cross nurses on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. However, it was actually taken in 1945, seven months after D-Day, in the French Riviera area.', ""It's worth noting not all photographs related to D-Day that we have fact-checked had incorrect captions."", 'For instance, the photograph below of three massive coils of pipe was genuine and depicted an actual D-Day invention.', 'Other D-Day-related fact checks referred to tweets by high-profile people. ', 'For example, in 2022, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer indeed tweeted, ""Today is Dday,"" on Dec. 7, which is National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. Years earlier, in 2018, U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, a Republican lawmaker from Georgia, drew attention online by including a picture of Nazi soldiers in a tweet to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. ', 'Some fact checks pertained to U.S. presidents.', 'For instance, in 2011, a misleading claim about a congressional bill targeted then-President Barack Obama. The bill was proposed in Congress to add a plaque of Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s D-Day prayer to the national World War II Memorial, but after receiving House approval, the proposal didn\'t pass the Senate. Months later, Snopes fact-checked a misleading rumor spread alleging that Obama\'s administration had ""killed"" the measure.', ""In a fact check the following year, we addressed a claim about presidents, specifically Obama, visiting D-Day monuments. Then, in June 2021, Snopes confirmed the legitimacy of claims that U.S. President Joe Biden failed to acknowledge the 77th anniversary of D-Day on or around that year's date."", ""Another viral rumor pertained to D-Day's death toll. In 2019, a claim alleged that gun violence in the U.S. killed more people in nine weeks than the total number of U.S. combatant deaths on D-Day. The assertion was mostly accurate. When we looked at the numbers, 2,487 gun-related deaths took place between Jan. 1, 2019, and March 6, 2019, which was close to the 2,501 U.S. soldiers known to have died on D-Day. "", 'We also fact-checked a tale supposedly recounting the heroic feats of James Doohan, who is best known for his role as Scotty in the original ""Star Trek"" television series, that was shared on Facebook in 2018.', ""According to a meme, Doohan was shot six times on D-Day. It turned out most of that story was true. He was one of thousands of Canadian soldiers who landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944, and it was true that at one point, a cigarette case stopped a bullet from wounding him during the invasion. However, it's unknown how many times he was shot. "", ""With the anniversary of D-Day in June, the Snopes newsroom will continue monitoring rumors about the historic day.

No amount of hyperbole can possibly do it justice.', 'Those commemorations take on added importance as the generation who fought in the war, who worked stateside in support and who sacrificed to ensure the nation’s success dwindles in number and succumbs to age and illness. We must remember them — their bravery and perseverance, even in the darkest moments when all seemed lost — so that future generations never forget.', '“You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months,” Gen Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his “Order of the Day” for June 6, 1944, “The eyes of the world are upon you. The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.”', 'The supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force knew what he was asking of the Marines, sailors, soldiers and airmen who had massed in southern England and drilled for months in preparation for the multi-pronged assault. He even had jotted down notes for a public message to accept blame — writing “it is mine alone” —  in case the audacious attack failed.', 'Despite the extensive preparations, meticulous planning and repeated practice, failure did seem imminent time and again.', 'Bombing runs meant to degrade German defenses along the beaches were ineffective. Heavy cloud cover complicated and confused the airborne insertion of allied troops behind enemy lines, meant to help forces landing on the beach. And the weather was uncooperative, with storms and roiling seas forcing Eisenhower to pause the invasion for 24 hours.', 'Yet, the cause could not wait. The goal of liberation — first the beachhead, then the continent — was both noble and urgent. The Nazis had to be stopped, whatever the cost.', 'So 81 years ago, nearly 160,000 troops, primarily from the United States, Great Britain and Canada, but with the support of nine other Allied nations, launched the largest amphibious invasion in history. They attacked positions along a 50-mile stretch of beach in northern France to establish a foothold that would allow the Allies to drive toward Berlin.', 'British and Canadian forces captured the Normandy beaches nicknamed Juno, Gold, and Sword with relative ease. For the Americans, however, Utah and Omaha beaches proved to be more troublesome. Omaha, in particular, was still well defended and the landscape more suitable for German forces dug in on the cliffs.', 'The fighting was fierce and brutal, the casualties heavy. More than 9,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on D-Day. More than half, 4,700, were American.

Eleven months later, Germany formally surrendered.', 'In an age when hostile nations increasingly rely on cyberattacks and drone strikes, what happened at D-Day almost defies comprehension.

Five thousand ships and 13,000 aircraft. All to take a heavily fortified 50-mile stretch of French shoreline, a herculean effort to reclaim a critical part of Europe from the Nazis and turn the tide of the most horrific war the world had ever seen.', 'On June 6, 1944 − D-Day − World War II\'s invasion of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord, got underway. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, told the men as they mobilized for battle: ""The eyes of the world are upon you. ... The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.""', ""Tolley Fletcher, at the time a 19-year-old Navy gunner's mate, remembered the rough seas and the treacherous landing troops at Utah Beach had to make in 3- to 4-foot waves, each carrying about 60 pounds of gear on their backs and descending on rope ladders from larger ships onto smaller landing crafts."", '""I felt for those soldiers,"" Fletcher, now 100 years old, told USA TODAY. ""In my mind, that was the worst part, other than people getting hurt.""', 'Fletcher, who joined the Navy at 17 in late December 1941, said he and his shipmates were fortunate to be mostly out of the line of fire. ""There was some shelling, not really a lot, and luckily we didn\'t get hit.', '""Maybe halfway in, we started seeing lots of bodies in the water,"" said Fletcher, who now lives in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area. ""I was asked (later) what we did about it. We didn\'t do anything about it − we had a job: to escort those troops to the beach.""', 'On D-Day, ""that\'s what these guys faced,"" said Peter Donovan Crean Sr., vice president for education and access at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. ""They knew they were in the presence of history. Soldiers, sailors, Marines − they knew what they were doing was going to go down in history, which also meant they knew the danger involved.', '""Guys who were 18, 19, 20 years old were faced with the possibility of their death, but they did it anyway.""', ""As we mark the 81st anniversary of D-Day, here is a look at what happened on the beaches of Normandy, the men who fought knowing they might not survive to see victory and the way it affected the Allies' fight to defeat fascism, genocide and tyranny."", ""In order to defeat the Nazis in Europe, the Allies knew they'd have to take France, under German occupation since 1940. Operation Overlord saw a mobilization of 2,876,000 Allied troops in Southern England, as well as hundreds of ships and airplanes, in preparation for a ground invasion, the largest the world had seen."", ""Weighing conditions including the weather, disagreements among other military leaders and strategic uncertainty, Eisenhower gave the go-ahead for the operation to begin before dawn on June 5, 1944. If things didn't go well for the Allies, Eisenhower wrote a note accepting responsibility. The following day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed along the 50-mile stretch of French shoreline."", 'More than 9,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded, and 100,000 troops would continue the slow, bloody journey to Berlin, the center of German power.', 'According to the U.S. Army, D-Day was ""simply an alliteration, as in H-Hour."" Some believe the first ""D"" also stands for ""day,"" a code designation, while the French say the ""D"" stands for ""disembarkation."" The Army\'s website says that ""the more poetic insist D-Day is short for \'day of decision.\'""', 'Asked in 1964, Eisenhower instructed his assistant Brig. Gen. Robert Schultz, to answer. Schultz wrote that ""any amphibious operation has a \'departed date\'; therefore the shortened term \'D-Day\' is used.”', 'D-Day was not the only decisive battle of the European theater, Crean said.', '""It was a crucial battle but there were more ahead,"" he said. ""They had 700 miles of tough road ahead to get to Berlin.""', 'The Battle of the Bulge, waged over 41 days in December 1944 and January 1945, required 700,000 Allied troops. ""It was a tough slog for another 11 months,"" Crean said.', ""Victory in Europe − V-E Day − would come on May 8, 1945, nearly a year after D-Day. The war wouldn't end until the Japanese surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945."", ""There are about 66,000 surviving World War II veterans in the United States, Crean said, and while that may sound like a lot, it's a tiny fraction of the 16.4 million who served their country in the conflict."", '""So to be able to talk to and thank one veteran now is a gift for any of us,"" Crean said.', 'The National World War II Museum\'s mission ""is more critical than ever ... so more people will understand what they did and continue to be inspired by their sacrifices,"" added Crean, a retired colonel with 30 years\' service in the Army.', 'The museum has had oral historians travel the country to record more than 12,000 personal stories from World War II veterans.

10 American inventions that helped win D-Day,https://www.businessinsider.com/american-inventions-helped-win-d-day-2025-6,"['While June 6 marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day, the preparations and planning that went into the Normandy landings — a pivotal World War II turning point, and one of the largest amphibious assaults in history — were years in the making.', 'Getting nearly 160,000 Allied troops to storm a 50-mile stretch of heavily fortified French coastline called for an unprecedented level of coordination among American, British, and Canadian soldiers and equipment. It also put new technologies to the test.', '""You have to control the air, the water, and the land all at once and come ashore with an inherent disadvantage,"" says National WWII Museum curator Cory Graff about Operation Overlord."" To do so successfully meant deploying not only manpower, but also a host of pioneering technologies and inventions — many of them American-made — from specialized landing craft to underwater breathing equipment to amphibious trucks.', '""This idea of combined arms integration requires military formations to do three things: shoot, move, and communicate,"" adds John Curatola, senior historian at the National WWII Museum. The Normandy invasion required the US Army, Navy, and Army Air Force to collaborate in a unified manner for a singular objective, while also working with counterparts for the cross-Channel invasion, he says.', 'These are some of the inventions that helped Allied troops win D-Day, all of which have evolved into systems still in use today.', 'The M4 Sherman was the backbone of the Allied armored force during World War II. Weighing roughly 40 tons, it was fast, reliable, and built by the thousands.', 'Sherman tanks proved key in helping the Allies break through German defenses at Utah and Omaha Beaches. Some were equipped with a bulldozer blade on the front that could cut through the defenses on the beach — and that would later function as hedgecutters used to break through wall-like hedges throughout Normandy.', 'Other Shermans were converted into Duplex Drive (DD) tanks — an amphibious design pioneered by the British. Outfitted with canvas flotation skirts and rear-mounted propellers, the DDs were meant to hit the beach alongside the first wave of infantry. While rough seas and weather doomed many off Omaha, those that made it ashore at Utah and Gold Beaches delivered crucial early support.', '""Everybody thinks the Germans had the coolest tanks, and I categorically reject that,"" says Curatola. ""The Shermans are relatively easy to maintain. The crews can fix them. They\'re relatively reliable with simple parts, and you\'re basically overwhelming the Germans with armor.""', 'Invented by: Developed by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department in 1941 and mass-produced by automakers including Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. The US manufactured 50,000 throughout the war.', 'Modern connection: While the Sherman was retired from combat decades ago, its simple, rugged design shaped post-war tank development and reinforced the importance of armored vehicles. Curatola considers the M1 Abrams tank that the US Army uses today the ""grandson"" of the Sherman.', 'Nicknamed the ""Walkie-Talkie,"" the Signal Corps Radio 300 was the first backpack radio for mobile infantry communication — and one of many radio varieties used on D-Day. Initially issued to US infantry in 1943, a soldier carried the nearly 40-pound SCR-300 transmitter and receiver on their back. With a three-mile range and 41 channels, the SCR-300 came in handy for real-time battalion-level communication during the highly chaotic, noisy beach landings', 'Invented by: Engineer Daniel E. Noble and his project team at Galvin Manufacturing Corporation. Originally founded by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin pre-war to develop early car radios, Galvin became Motorola in 1947. Galvin engineers also developed a handheld, single-channel AM radio — the SCR-536, or ""Handie-Talkie"" — for battlefield communication at the platoon or company level.', 'Modern connection: The SCR-300\'s pioneering use of frequency modulation (or ""FM"") technology paved the foundation for future portable communication devices, including cell phones.', 'The Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel was a 36-foot landing craft made famous in the opening scene of the 1998 film, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Known as Higgins boats for its American inventor, 1,000 LCVPs were used to deliver troops across all five beaches during the Normandy landings, which marked the single largest deployment of LCVPs. Without these shallow-bottomed boats, landing directly on the open beaches with armor and troops would\'ve been logistically impossible.', 'Invented by: New-Orleans-based shipbuilder and entrepreneur Andrew Higgins of Higgins Industries. He is said to have borrowed the front ramp idea from Japanese boats after seeing photos from the Sino-Japanese War. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower called Higgins ""the man who won the war for us.""', ""Modern connection: The front-ramp design has continued to inspire modern amphibious landing craft, including the US Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion and Landing Craft Utility."", 'The LST was a large cargo vessel used to land troops and armored vehicles without docking to a pier. Its large bow doors were designed to open to a ramp that let tanks and trucks drive directly from the ship to land. ""To liberate continents, you need bulk. You need throughput…so you can do operations inland. And the LST allowed the Allies to do that without a fixed port,"" Curatola says.', ""Invented by: The LST was designed by American naval architect John C. Niedermair in response to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's request for a ship that would carry some 500 tons worth of tanks following the Dunkirk evacuation."", 'Modern connection: In a matter of hours, Niedermair sketched the design for a ship regarded as one of the most successful in the history of the US Navy.', 'The DUKW (pronounced ""duck"") was a 6-wheel-drive amphibious truck capable of transporting about 5,000 pounds of cargo (or 24 troops) on land and water; a propeller could chug it through water with a max speed of 6 mph. ""The beauty of this thing is, not only is it amphibious, but it can drive inland and provide supplies to troops well beyond the beach at up to 50 miles an hour,"" says Curatola.', 'Invented by: The DUKW was a product of collaborations among GMC, the naval architecture firm Sparkman & Stephens, and a Michigan-based bus manufacturer.', 'Modern connection: The DUKW pioneered a feature that allowed drivers to change the tire pressure from inside the cab to accommodate different terrains, which remains a common feature on military vehicles today.', 'The C-47 Dakota, nicknamed ""the workhorse,"" had many uses in both World War II theaters, from cargo and troop transportation to casualty evacuation and towing. More than 800 C-47s were used in the D-Day campaign to insert thousands of paratroopers and huge amounts of equipment behind enemy lines.', 'Invented by: Douglas Aircraft Company adapted its pre-war commercial airliner, the DC-3, for military use. It was relatively quiet and could carry up to 28 troops or 6,000 pounds of cargo. The US produced more than 10,000 C-47s.', 'Modern connection: Valued for its versatility, the C-47 was used in the Vietnam War. Variants are still in use for civilian cargo transport.', 'The Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit was a closed-circuit rebreather designed to recycle exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. The apparatus enabled divers to operate underwater for prolonged periods without leaving a trail of bubbles. Lambertsen, working for the Office of Strategic Services, trained OSS commandos to use the LARU for underwater reconnaissance and demolition missions in support of D-Day and other key landings.', 'Invented by: Christian Lambertsen, who, as a University of Pennsylvania medical student in the early 1940s, designed the LARU as a self-contained breathing device ideal for covert underwater missions.', 'Modern connection: Lambertsen himself coined the acronym ""SCUBA"" (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus). His equipment and techniques paved the way for rebreathing technologies still used by military divers, including Navy SEALs. He\'s considered ""the father of US Combat Diving.""', 'These burlap, straw-stuffed mannequins were relatively small, lightweight decoys that could be dropped from planes to give the illusion of incoming paratroopers. A form of psychological warfare, the dolls were used to confuse and mislead the enemy. Dummies were sometimes equipped with noisemakers that sounded like gunfire or explosive charges that detonated on landing, adding to the illusion.', 'On the night of June 5, 1944, Allied planes dropped hundreds of these fake paratroopers, along with inflatable tanks, across the French countryside to give off the impression of airborne troops landing in areas far from the real drop zones. In several cases, German units responded to these fake drops.', 'Invented by: Inspired by the British ""Rupert"" paradummy, the American version, nicknamed ""Oscar,"" was more compact, with the 3-foot-tall ones used on D-Day mainly manufactured in the UK.', ""Modern connection: While today's military decoys are generally more technologically advanced (e.g., electronic signature emitters), the principle of deception through false targets and diversionary tactics remains."", 'The proximity fuze — an electronic fuze for bombs, shells, or missiles that explodes when approaching a target — changed the rules of artillery in warfare; instead of needing a direct hit, anti-aircraft shells could suddenly detonate when they got close. They made Allied anti-aircraft fire far more effective in taking out German planes, helping protect the beachhead.', 'Invented by: Developed beginning in 1940 by American scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, with critical contributions from British researchers. Key to the design was the miniature radio transmitter and receiver inside the shell that sensed nearby targets and triggered detonation.', ""Modern connection: The proximity fuze was a major step toward today's precision-guided weapons. Its combination of electronic sensing and remote detonation paved the way for modern guided bombs and missiles."", 'From the moment the first Allied troops hit the beaches of Normandy, this newly introduced American 4x4 was in motion, hauling supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers, towing anti-tank guns, and zipping across shell-scarred roads. Compact, reliable, and endlessly adaptable, it proved essential to the invasion of Normandy, along with many other battles.', 'Invented by: In 1940, facing the likelihood of entering the war, the US Army issued an emergency contract for a lightweight reconnaissance vehicle, prompting the development of the first Jeep prototype by Bantam Car Company in just 49 days. With Bantam lacking production capacity, Willys-Overland and Ford were tapped to manufacture the final design, cranking out hundreds of thousands of units over the course of the war. Some Jeeps were waterproofed for the landings, sealed tight and fitted with snorkels to wade ashore behind the infantry. Others were dropped by parachute into French fields with the 101st and 82nd Airborne, ready to drive the moment they hit the ground.', ""Modern connection: After the war, Willys began selling civilian versions, branding them as Civilian Jeep models and kickstarting America's obsession with off-road vehicles and SUVs."", 'Katie S.

"World War II: D-Day, The Invasion of Normandy",https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/world-war-ii-d-day-invasion-normandy,"['The D-Day operation of June 6, 1944, brought together the land, air, and sea forces of the allied armies in what became known as the largest amphibious invasion in military history. The operation, given the codename OVERLORD, delivered five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The beaches were given the code names UTAH, OMAHA, GOLD, JUNO, and SWORD. The invasion force included 7,000 ships and landing craft manned by over 195,000 naval personnel from eight allied countries. Almost 133,000 troops from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and their allies, landed on D-Day. Casualties from these countries during the landing numbered 10,300.

Despite initial breakthroughs that created the namesake “bulge,” Allied troops quickly crushed the attack. This ill-fated campaign marked the Third Reich’s last major offensive on the Western Front, leaving its armies crippled and its homeland exposed.', '“It was so gosh darn cold that you could have a fire, but you couldn’t tell it was burning, you couldn’t feel the heat off of it. No joke,” Pullan said in an interview with Hometown Heroes Radio.', 'On Dec. 26, Patton’s Third Army executed a daring 100-mile pivot through icy roads, relieving the town and severing German supply lines.', 'By Jan. 16, the “bulge” had been erased, with Nazi forces fleeing eastward, abandoning tanks and equipment.', '“They burned their last reserves for a few miles of forest,” said a Pentagon strategist. “Now their Western army is spent.”', 'German losses were catastrophic: 120,000 casualties, 600 tanks and 1,600 aircraft – irreplaceable blows to a Reich already reeling from Soviet advances in the east.

Inmates called this sick ward the ""Block of Death,"" date not specified.', 'Entering Germany in the spring of 1945, Pullan’s unit encountered the sprawling complex of Buchenwald, the largest and one of the most infamous concentration camps of the Third Reich.', 'As the Allied soldiers approached, the camp’s gates yawned open, revealing emaciated figures draped in striped rags, their eyes hollow with unspeakable suffering. The stench of death clung to the air; piles of bodies lay stacked like “cordwood.”', 'Troops, many battle-weary, were unprepared for the scale of horror. Descriptions of “vomiting,” “crying,” and “rage” were common.', 'When Pullan entered Buchenwald, hardened by months of combat, he said he stared into the abyss of human cruelty.', '“We hit Buchenwald (after) the combat troops had already been in there,” he said. “We got in there and the ovens were still warm … and still had skeletons inside some of them. How could people possibly, possibly be like this, but they were.”', 'From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators established a vast network of more than 44,000 incarceration sites, including concentration camps, ghettos and detention centers.', 'These facilities were explicitly designed to exploit forced labor, imprison enemies of the state and systematically exterminate millions. Victims included over 6 million Jews, 3.5 million Soviet POWs, up to 500,000 Roma, 270,000 people with disabilities, and thousands of homosexuals and Jehovah’s Witnesses.', 'The windswept bluffs of Normandy bear witness: more than 9,000 graves stand in solemn rows at the American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, honoring the ultimate sacrifice made by U.S. troops on European soil during World War II, date not specified.', 'By the war’s end, more than 17 million people had been murdered in Nazi concentration camps.', 'The acrid smell of burning flesh hung thick over towns near concentration camps. Prisoners’ screams pierced the night. Trains crammed with hollow-eyed souls rattled past villages. Yet many Germans clung to denial, dismissing the horrors unfolding just beyond their gardens.', 'This collective refusal to believe stemmed not from ignorance, but from a web of propaganda, fear and complicity spun by the Nazi regime.', 'When rumors of mass graves emerged, the regime dismissed them as enemy lies. Citizens, conditioned by years of indoctrination, German citizens often found it easier to doubt reality than face the horrific truth.', 'Even liberation couldn’t immediately break the spell.', 'In April 1945, U.S. troops forced nearby German civilians to witness the concentration camps firsthand. Confronted with piles of emaciated corpses, the stench of decay, and the accusatory stares of survivors, many still insisted, ""We knew nothing!"" – a common refrain across Germany. Postwar surveys exposed the painful reality, more than 40% admitted harboring suspicions of mass murder but chose to deny their existence to survive persecution themselves.', '“They were people (civilians), just outside the gate and we talked to them, they told us they didn’t know what was going on and yet we could smell it from a mile down the road, with boxcars still out on the railroad full of dead,” Pullan said. “We just couldn’t imagine how anybody could be so bloody, stinking mean and rotten.”', 'As Allied forces dislodged the final pockets of German resistance near Kassel in WWII’s closing months, Pullan paused to photograph a farmer working his field. In a cruel twist of fate, the soldier who had miraculously survived unscathed since D-Day took one final step – only for the earth to betray him. Beneath the deceptively peaceful soil lay a landmine.', 'The explosion sent him flying one way and his camera hurling the other.', 'Medics in World War II served as critical lifelines on the front lines, performing duties far beyond basic first aid. Their role blended immense courage with medical skill under extreme conditions, and their impact was measured in countless lives saved, date and location not specified.', 'Severely wounded, Pullan lay crumpled on the battlefield as his comrades rushed to his side. They bandaged his injuries and carried him to a field hospital in the same weathered ox cart he’d just captured on film.', 'Medics scrambled to stabilize him, their voices low as they debated whether amputation would be unavoidable.', '“My arm was hanging down beside me and my legs were just all shot up,” Pullan said. “I don’t remember anything else until I woke up and my arm was in a sling, I was laying in a bed and bandaged everything else. What a trip.”', 'Meanwhile, his camera – left behind in the chaos – was found by the farmer who later entrusted it to the Red Cross. Miraculously, the faded scrawl of Pullan’s name and service number inside the camera case ensured its journey back to its owner. Decades later, he chuckled during a talk with the Veterans Support Center, “Camera’s a survivor – just like me.”', 'Although Pullan would spend 60 days recouping and rehabbing in a German hospital, his time there wasn’t without its lighter moments.', '“We had a German nurse – about 20 – (in charge of a ward of about 100 wounded) and every time she’d come through there, there were all kinds of remarks made. She never said a word, she’d go about doing her job. Finally, one day, one of the guys said to her, ‘Oh baby, if you only spoke English,’ and she said, ‘I speak English.’ That ward shut up, dead silence, not a sound,” Pullan said with a belly laugh.', '“From that time on … there was never another bad remark,” he added.', 'By the time Pullan was discharged from the hospital, the men of the 911th had celebrated the triumph of VE-Day, only to confront the sobering prospect of redeployment to the relentless conflict still raging in the Pacific.', '“May 8 is a day everyone cried and said they were glad it’s over … but I was (assigned) to a unit going to the Pacific … I said, ‘Not this guy.’ This guy is going home. I’ve got all the points I need. I’m going home,” Pullan said.', 'Pullan was correct.', '“Finally on Oct. 3, 1945 – the most beautiful birthday I ever had I walked up the gangplank to board a ship to come home,” he added.', 'Pullan left the Army, reaching the rank of corporal, and was awarded a Purple Heart.', 'Decades later, he reflected on the experience, saying, “When we went through those concentration camps, we realized what freedom really is. Those people gave up their lives. They couldn’t even fight for it; they just had it taken away.”', 'Returning to Salt Lake City, Pullan soon got busy reinventing his life.', ""“I dated a girl named Ruth before I ever went into the Army, but she couldn’t stand me,” Pullan said. “She called me a peeled onion because I had blond hair and I pulled it straight back. (When I got home) I thought, 'Oh I’ll call her.'”"", 'Their courtship began with a late-night vigil outside the Center Theater, where Ruth worked.', '“At 10 p.m. I was standing outside the theater and saw this beautiful woman walking up and I thought ‘My gosh.’ I’m a snot-nose kid and look at that beautiful lady,” Pullan said. Five days later, they were married.', 'In 2006, Pullan returned to Normandy to relive one of the most pivotal times in his life and to reflect on how war reveals life as fleeting, now you see it, now you don’t.', '“I was just awful lucky,” he said in a 2022 article printed in the VA News. “There were a lot of them in front of me that didn’t make it, and a lot of them behind me that didn’t make it. When those pieces of shell start flying, they don’t have anybody’s name on them, they just sail along until they catch somebody.”', 'Pullan, died in 2023 at age 99, leaving behind a legacy etched in memories.

After this, however, the two became synonymous, and now D-Day is commonly understood to refer to the beginning of Operation Overlord.', 'D-Day saw unprecedented cooperation between international armed forces, with more than 2 million troops in the UK in preparation for the invasion, according to the Imperial War Museums (IWM).', 'Most of these troops were American, British and Canadian, the IWM reports, but troops also came from Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Poland to participate in Operation Overlord.', 'The Allied troops’ invasion was coordinated across air, land and sea, in what can be described as amphibious landings.', 'These were preceded by an extensive bombing campaign to damage German defenses, as well as the employment of deception tactics.', 'Operation Bodyguard was an umbrella term for the deception strategy leading up to the Allies’ invasion of Europe in June 1944. Operation Fortitude was a tactic under this umbrella specifically related to the Normandy invasion, and was intended to make Nazi Germany believe that the initial Normandy attacks were merely a diversion and that the true invasion would take place elsewhere.', 'According to the IWM, Fortitude North intended to trick the Germans into believing that the Allies would attack Norway, and Fortitude South was designed to convince the Germans that the Allies were going to invade Pas de Calais, a French department northeast of Normandy that is closer to the UK.', 'The US troops were assigned to Utah beach at the base of the Cotentin Peninsular and Omaha Beach at the northern end of the Normandy coast. The British subsequently landed on Gold Beach, followed by the Canadians at Juno, and finally the British at Sword, the easternmost point of the invasion.', 'By midnight, the troops had secured their beachheads and moved further inland from Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword.', 'However, not all the landings were successful; US forces suffered substantial losses at Omaha Beach, where strong currents forced many landing craft away from their intended positions, delaying and hampering the invasion strategy.', 'Heavy fire from German positions on the steep cliffs, which had not been effectively destroyed by Allied bombing before the invasion, also caused casualties.', 'According to the IWM, Germany’s reaction to Operation Overlord was “slow and confused.”', 'Weather conditions on June 6 were still poor, many senior commanders were not at their posts, and Operation Fortitude convinced Adolf Hitler that the Normandy invasion was a feint before a bigger attack at Pas de Calais.', 'Germany’s air force was in action elsewhere, countering American bombing operations over Germany. Its navy ships were docked in ports or already destroyed by the Allies. This left only the German army to defend against Operation Overlord, according to the IWM.', 'On top of this, the success of Operation Fortitude meant that many army units were kept away from the Normandy battlefield until July, as an attack in Pas de Calais was still expected.', 'German troops manning coastal defenses “did as much as they could have been expected to,” the IWM says, before eventually being “silenced” and Allied units advanced inland.', 'On D-Day alone, around 4,440 Allied troops were confirmed dead, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), with more than 5,800 troops wounded or missing.', 'Because Omaha Beach was the bloodiest landing beach, the US Army lost the most men in the amphibious landings. Some 2,500 American troops died in the beach assault and airborne operations on D-Day, according to the CWGC.', 'The precise number of German casualties on the day is unknown, but they are estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000.', 'Of the tens of thousands of troops that stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, 44 were soldiers, sailors and airmen from Bedford, Virginia, in the US.', 'Within minutes of reaching Omaha Beach, 16 of these men were killed and four were wounded. Another Bedford soldier was killed elsewhere on Omaha Beach, and three others were presumed killed in action, bringing Bedford’s D-Day fatality figure to 20 men.', 'According to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, Bedford suffered the highest known per capita D-Day loss in the US.', 'Despite securing a stronghold on the French coast on D-Day, the Allied forces faced the risk that German bombardment could push them back into the sea.', 'They needed to build up troop numbers and equipment in Normandy faster than the Germans, allowing for a continued invasion into mainland Europe.', 'The Allies used their air power to slow the German advance toward Normandy by blowing up bridges, railways and roads across the region. This allowed the Allies to gain total control of Normandy 77 days later and move on toward Paris, which they liberated in August 1944.', 'The US Department of Defense calls D-Day the “successful beginning of the end of Hitler’s tyrannical regime.” The IWM calls it the “most significant victory of the Western Allies in the Second World War.”', 'By being able to get forces into Normandy, the Allies were able to begin their advance into northwest Europe. Though World War II lasted nearly another year in Europe, the success of Operation Overlord led to the liberation of France and allowed the Allies to fight the Germans in Nazi-occupied Europe.', 'The US’ National World War II Museum says that a good way to appreciate the significance of D-Day is to imagine what would have happened if the operation had failed. According to the museum, another landing would have not been possible for at least a year.', 'In this time, Hitler could have strengthened Nazi-occupied Europe’s coastal defenses, developed aircraft and weapons, bombed the UK even more heavily and continued his killing campaign, the museum says.', 'Fighting by the Allies on the western front and Russian soldiers on the eastern front eventually led to the defeat of the German Nazi forces.', 'On May 7, 1945, the German Third Reich signed an unconditional surrender at Reims, France. Victory in Europe (V-E) Day is celebrated the following day as that’s when the armistice went into effect.', '© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Their entrance into the cavernous exhibition hall was met with steady applause. Most were in wheelchairs, pushed by family members.', 'Among the veterans was Ret. Judge Steven Ellis, 100, who served on a Navy landing vessel called a LST 751 in the Pacific Theater after joining the ROTC at Tulane University as a 19-year-old student.', '""World War II was a world-changing event and yet so many of the people I talk to really don’t know anything about it,"" said Ellis, who still volunteers at the museum on weekends, sharing his experience with visitors. ""They come here to learn, and this museum is so effective at teaching and telling a story that needs to be told.""', 'Exciting day', 'The National WWII Museum was conceived by University of New Orleans history professor Stephen Ambrose to tell the story of the Allied invasion of France that eventually liberated Europe.', 'Nick Mueller, the museum’s founding board chair and executive director from 2000 to 2017, remembers arriving at the idea with Ambrose, his friend and colleague at UNO, over a glass of sherry after work.', 'At the time, Ambrose was collecting oral histories of D-Day veterans and envisioned a small museum that would serve as a repository for what was then 600 or so taped interviews.', '“He thought we could build it for about $1 million,” said Mueller, who was dean and vice chancellor at UNO at the time. “I said it would take at least $4 million.”', 'Ten years and some $20 million later, the National D-Day Museum opened on June 6, 2000. By then, business and civic leaders had gotten behind the project. So had prominent celebrities and history buffs, including director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, who were working on the HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" based on Ambrose’ book by the same name.', 'Hanks and Spielberg attended the opening, which attracted more than 300,000 people and was marked by a military parade and a flyover of vintage aircraft. They sat on a dais outside the new facility with Ambrose and Mueller and other notables, including NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and then-U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.', ' “It was one of the most exciting three days of my life,” said Mueller. “And from that day on, the museum has exceeded our expectations in almost every way.”  ', 'Trusted resource', ""In its first years, the museum consisted of a single exhibition hall focused on that piece of the war's long and complex history."", ""It has grown into the country's official World War II museum with a seven-acre campus that has seven educational pavilions, a hotel and conference center, and additional buildings it will use for future growth."", ""Most of the museum's growth began after the release of a 2004 master plan that kicked off the 20-year Road to Victory Capital Campaign and mapped out the museum's current footprint. That campaign eventually raised $420 million and concluded in late 2023 with a ceremony dedicating the Liberation Pavilion, which focuses on the end of the war, the Holocaust and the post-war story."", ""The new Victory's Promise campaign aims to reach more visitors locally and through traveling exhibitions; produce and distribute content about World War II and expand access to the museum’s collections, resources, and expertise; and create new educational resources for students and teachers."", '“We want to become the most accessible and trusted resource on World War II in the country,” Watson said.', 'The campaign lays out specific, ambitious goals it wants to reach by 2035. Those annual targets include attracting 1 million visitors to the campus; offering free, guided field trips for 50,000 Louisiana students; engaging 15,000 teachers; and reaching 2 million more visitors through traveling exhibitions.', 'The plan calls for using more than $100 million to maintain buildings and exterior spaces, update and enhance exhibits, and renovate pavilions, as well complete some new construction. ', 'Another $150 million will go towards building up the museum’s endowment, which is currently around $60 million.', '“When we get to the end of the campaign, our work won’t stop,"" Watson said. ""Part of what we will do is try to raise money for our endowment so as we scale, we will be able to sustain our efforts.”', 'Already, the museum has secured commitments for $40 million, including a $1 million gift from former California Gov. Pete Wilson and his wife, Gayle Wilson, who were present at Friday’s ceremony.', 'A high standard', 'In the years since its opening, the museum has attracted about 10.5 million visitors to the city, or more than 625,000 a year on average, museum officials said.', 'About 85% come from out of state and absorb 1,000 local hotel rooms a night, including some of the 230 rooms in the $66.5 million Higgins Hotel, which opened in 2019 on Magazine Street on the museum campus.', '“We built the hotel and conference center because so many of our visitors are from out of town,” Watson said. “We also do residential learning programs that we can host at the conference center.”', 'According to tourism officials, the museum has been a significant driver of economic activity in the city and helped counter the narrative that New Orleans is all about Bourbon Street and bachelorette parties.', 'It also has established itself as a world leader among history museums, according to consultant Gail Lord, whose Toronto-based firm Lord Cultural Resources has worked for the Louvre and the Smithsonian.', '“There are many military museums around the world, and they all respect this museum and go visit to find out what they are doing and how they are doing it,” said Lord, who created the 2004 master plan. “They set a very high standard.”', 'More important than ever', 'The message of the WWII Museum is increasingly important in an era of rising isolationism and authoritarianism, museum officials said.', '“This museum tells the story of the fight for freedom, democracy and the survival of our country against two fascist, totalitarian rulers who were bent on our destruction,” Mueller said. “We show how we won the war and what has kept us out of World War III for the past 80 years.”  ', 'The ""promise"" the Victory’s Promise campaign refers to is a vow to the veterans who fought in the war and whose numbers are dwindling. In the early years of the museum, dozens of World War II veterans regularly volunteered, sharing their experiences with visitors and bringing the war to life in new ways.', '""When I started doing this a decade ago, at age 90, there were a couple of guys every morning that would come,"" Ellis said.

We\'re running a little short.""', ""Ellis said he believes it's important to tell the story of the war today more than ever."", '""Democracy and freedom matter,"" he said.

‘My Modest Father Was a D-Day Hero – This Is Why He Filled Me With Pride’,https://www.kyivpost.com/post/54025,"['', 'EN', 'Lord Ashcroft pays homage to his D-Day hero father and all those who stormed the beaches of Normandy in Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, to hasten the end of the Second World War.', 'The fact that there are still Second World War veterans who are determined to travel to northern France this week to mark the 81st anniversary of D-Day makes me feel proud and emotional in equal measures. For these are former service personnel, now aged each side of their 100th birthdays, who could so easily stay at home but, just as they did more than eight decades ago, they have displayed a humbling sense of resolve and determination in journeying to Normandy.', 'This is because, for the most part, they want to pay their respects and remember fallen friends and comrades who died or were seriously wounded on or close to the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944, while taking part in what became known as the “D-Day landings.” It’s incredible to think that on the British Normandy Memorial, which was officially unveiled on June 6, 2021 by His Majesty The King (then the Prince of Wales), there are the names of the 22,442 servicemen and women under British command who fell on D-Day and during the Battle of Normandy in the summer of 1944. The memorial, which is situated on a hillside overlooking Gold Beach, finally brought together the names of these brave individuals from more than 30 countries who gave their lives for their King, their country, their comrades and for wider freedoms.', '', 'Inevitably, because of their age, some of these veterans will be travelling to Normandy this week for the final time. Whether or not they are able to return again in future, they will all go home with treasured memories of their 2025 visit.', 'In truth, the mere mention of D-Day makes me feel a little proud and emotional for personal reasons. For my late father, Eric Ashcroft, whom I loved and admired, was one of those who took part in the D-Day landings.', 'Then a young lieutenant serving with the South Lancashire Regiment, he and his fellow officers had been privately briefed ahead of D-Day to expect up to 75% casualties – dead and wounded – as the first landing craft arrived on the beaches.', 'As part of “Operation Neptune” – within the wider context of “Operation Overlord” – around 155,000 men came across the Channel to land on five beach areas, each given a codename. They reached their destination in assorted ships and landing craft, numbering upwards of 6,000 vessels.', 'My father and his fellow “South Lancs” soldiers had been designated to land at Sword Beach in the first wave at 7.30 a.m. As the ramps of their landing craft dropped down and they raced up the beach, they encountered anti-tank, mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire from a German strong point at the top of the beach.', 'My father later described his run up the beach in an interview recorded decades later for the Imperial War Museum (IWM). He said: “About two-thirds to high watermark, I was knocked sideways when, so it would appear now, an 88mm splinter struck my right arm as I was moving across the beach.”', 'Resting beneath a bank, he applied a field dressing to his bloodied wound and crouched beside his Commanding Officer (CO). “Colonel [Richard] Burbury was about two feet away from me and the next thing I knew he rolled to his side and was shot in the chest,” my father said. His CO, aged 38, had been shot dead by a sniper.', 'Later in the day, after his battalion had achieved most of its objectives, my father was ordered from the battlefield to receive treatment for his wounds. He returned to Britain on a hospital ship and eventually made a full recovery.', 'I credit my father with what has turned into my lifelong passion for bravery. Eric Ashcroft was a quiet, modest man but, when I was aged about 10, he recounted his wartime experiences to me for the first time. It filled me with pride that my father had displayed such courage and had played a part, if only a small one, in such a historic event.', 'Eventually, my passion for valor transformed into an interest in gallantry medals. I purchased my first Victoria Cross (VC), Britain and the Commonwealth’s most prestigious decoration for bravery in the presence of the enemy, in 1986.', 'Over the following decades, I amassed the world’s largest collection of VCs, currently more than 200 in number, and a smaller collection of George Crosses (GCs), Britain and the Commonwealth’s most prestigious decoration for bravery not in the presence of the enemy.', 'That collection, my pride and joy, went on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the IWM in 2010. At the IWM’s request, I paid £5 million to design and build the gallery to house the medals, along with other VCs and GCs belonging to, or loaned to, the IWM.', 'It was therefore heartbreaking, not to say somewhat galling, when I learnt from a third party earlier this year that the IWM had decided to close the gallery bearing my name.', 'Living VC and GC recipients and many others have since expressed their anger that the gallery is to be shut down after just 15 years.', 'Originally the gallery was due to close on June 1, but I have now “persuaded” the IWM, with a little help from my legal team, that the gallery should remain open until the end of September.', 'I hope thousands of people will take advantage of this temporary reprieve to visit it and learn more about the actions of the men and women who I like to refer to as “the bravest of the brave.”', 'I will not be in Normandy this week due to other commitments, but I have visited both Sword Beach and the British Normandy Memorial in recent years to pay my respects to our fallen heroes.', 'I will end where I began by paying tribute to the Second World War veterans who are travelling to Normandy this week.', 'The importance of such a visit was described perfectly by war veteran George Batts, MBE, in an interview conducted in 2021 when he visited the British Normandy Memorial for the first, and what was to be the last, time.', 'Mr. Batts, who was an 18-year-old serving in the Royal Engineers when he took part in the D-Day landings and who died in 2022 aged 97, said: “We lucky ones, we got off [survived] but we left a lot of mates behind. And you never forget them. When you come back here, you see their faces. And, of course, they’ll never be older.

It was quiet as a mouse,” he told me. “Then something hit me in the back of the head. I looked and it was a German. He hit me and I hit him, then we both pulled out our revolvers and started shooting. With all that commotion, that was the end of the resting.”', 'He downplays it now, but the danger was very real.
