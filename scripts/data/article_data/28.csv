RBI Surprises With Double Rate Cut Than Expected: What It Means For EMIs,https://www.ndtv.com/business-news/rbi-cuts-repo-rate-by-50-basis-points-8600641,"['The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has slashed its key lending rate, or the repo rate, by 50 basis points to 5.5% as inflation softens within its comfort level. The decision was unanimously taken at the bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. which was held on June 4-6 and was headed by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra.', 'This comes as a relief for borrowers who may expect lower EMIs for long-term loans and may be especially beneficial for homebuyers.', 'Mr Malhotra asserted that the global backdrop remains fragile, and trade projections have been revised downwards, but the Indian economy is progressing well despite the global uncertainties.', '""India\'s strength comes from the strong balance sheets of the five major sectors. The Indian economy offers immense opportunities to local and foreign investors. We are already growing at a fast rate. We aspire to grow faster,"" he said.', 'Inflation has softened significantly, the RBI Governor said, and the near-term and medium-term outlook exudes confidence. Food inflation outlook remains soft, and core inflation is expected to remain benign.', '', '', ""The RBI also projected that retail inflation for the current financial year would be 3.7% against its April projection of 4%. Government data shows it fell to 3.16% in April from 3.34% in March, remaining within the RBI's comfort level."", 'The various economic indicators remain strong, with the RBI Governor pointing to a gradual rise in discretionary spending and healthy private consumption. Industrial activity is gaining gradually while the services sector is likely to maintain momentum, he said. Rural demand remains steady while urban demand is improving, he added.', 'The RBI kept the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection unchanged at 6.5% in the current financial year. The quarterly projections are: 2.9% (April-June), 3.4% (July-September), 3.9% (October-December), and 4.4% (January-March).', 'The central bank also reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 bps and said it will release Rs 2.5 lakh crore of bank funds.

Monetary policy to push growth,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/monetary-policy-to-push-growth-101749221479304.html,"['', 'If there was any misconception that India’s economic policy establishment had become complacent about the economy’s growth prospects after a stellar 7.4% GDP growth in the March quarter, the latest Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) decision has quelled it. Price stability is only a necessary, and not a sufficient condition to ensure growth, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said unequivocally in his statement released after the MPC meeting on Friday. While MPC has retained the GDP growth forecast for 2025-26 at 6.5%, which is what it was in its April resolution, it has administered a 50-basis point reduction in its policy rate. This is double what markets were expecting — and is a strong signal that the economy needs a booster dose of strong medicine, not an incremental one.', 'To be sure, MPC’s action should be seen as more a frontloading of monetary easing than an intent to lower interest rates further. This is what explains the change in monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral. Markets have cheered this move and India’s benchmark stock market index closed 0.9% higher on Friday. With the new income tax slabs already in place, a quick transmission of the new policy rates should provide additional tailwinds to disposable incomes for households even as a good monsoon boosts rural demand.', 'This is good news for the economy’s growth prospects in the short-run. However, it remains to be seen whether this policy and sentiment boost manages to kickstart the dormant private capex cycle in the economy. RBI’s aggressive easing has also been facilitated by a benign inflationary environment. The annual inflation forecast for 2025-26 now stands at 3.7% instead of 4% in the April resolution. That the governor’s statement has taken the effort to describe India’s relative economic advantage in terms of a 5x3x3 matrix of strong balance sheet in five sectors (corporates, banks, households, government and the external sector), stability on three fronts (price, financial and political) and opportunities through three Ds (demography, digitalisation and domestic demand) shows that the policy arm wants to send a strong message to markets, both domestic and foreign, about India’s future economic prospects in the hope of positioning it better for harvesting growth opportunities outside the domestic economy.', 'However, there is also a realisation, and rightly so, that external headwinds to growth are not going away anytime, notwithstanding India’s progress in making some trade deals even as others (including with the US) are in the works. Without prejudice to the ongoing policy efforts on the trade front, benefits might not necessarily materialise. The Trump administration in the US continues to behave in an erratic manner in its dealings both inside and outside the country. Getting a trade deal with the US is only part of dealing with the current challenge as Trump’s economic policies, especially on the fiscal front, could also send shock waves in financial markets. Such volatility is bound to affect growth in other countries, India included.', 'The key takeaway from the latest MPC decision is threefold. Monetary policy has replaced fiscal policy as the growth cushion in the Indian economy. Economic policy is working on the external but banking on the domestic to power the economy. And, the monetary and fiscal arms are in sync with each other to ensure that at least one of the policy drivers continues to pursue growth while the other protects stability.

', 'According to SBI Research’s Ecowrap report, this staggered CRR cut is expected to release Rs 2.5 lakh crore of primary liquidity into the banking system by the end of 2025. The cut will roll out in four tranches of 25 bps each on September 6, October 4, November 1, and November 29, effectively bringing the CRR down from 4% to 3%—a level last seen in March 2020, before the pandemic began.', 'This infusion of durable liquidity is expected to ease funding pressures on banks, lower the cost of funds, and aid in more efficient transmission of monetary policy into the credit markets.', 'While the CRR reduction may not mathematically change deposit or lending rates, it is likely to enhance the money multiplier by 20–30 bps and provide a 3–5 bps cushion to banks’ net interest margins (NIMs). This is particularly significant in a declining rate environment, where banks often struggle to maintain spreads between lending and deposit rates.', 'The CRR cut complements the RBI’s earlier moves this year, which included two repo rate reductions of 25 bps each in February and April 2025, followed by a surprise 50 bps cut in June, bringing the repo rate to 5.5%. This takes the cumulative rate cut for the year to 100 bps, marking one of the most aggressive easing cycles in recent times.', 'Transmission of policy rates has been strong, particularly due to the growing share of loans linked to the External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR), which now covers around 60.2% of total loans. These loans respond almost immediately to repo rate changes. In contrast, 35.9% of loans are still linked to the Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR), where rate adjustments occur more gradually due to longer reset periods.', 'The transmission has also started impacting the deposit side, with banks having reduced fixed deposit (FD) rates by 30–70 bps since February 2025. Further reductions are expected in the coming quarters as banks adjust to lower funding costs and reprice term liabilities. Some banks have already begun tweaking savings account interest rates to protect margins as loan yields decline faster than deposit costs.', ""SBI Research's Variance Decomposition Analysis (VAR model) demonstrated that over 52% of the variance in loan rates after 12 months can be explained by repo rate shocks. This underscores the strong and persistent transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. Initially, the pass-through is muted, with only 9% of loan rate variance explained by repo rate changes in the first month. However, the impact becomes more pronounced over time."", 'The report noted that RBI’s twin strategy—cutting both the repo rate and CRR—shows a clear intent to stimulate credit demand, support economic recovery, and maintain financial stability. With CPI inflation projected to average 3.7% in FY26, and GDP growth forecast at 6.5%, the RBI has also shifted its policy stance from accommodative to neutral, signalling a more cautious approach going forward amid narrowing policy headroom.', '', 'Copyright © 2025 Living Media India Limited.

Most manufacturers see easy financing of durable products getting a boost. For perspective, almost 47-48% of consumer durable sales in India happens through easy financing schemes.', 'Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO, Super Plastronics, a Noida-based consumer durables maker, says: “The repo rate cut will boost consumption because with EMIs coming down in general, consumers will have more money in their hands to spend. I see interest rates on consumer durable loans coming down by about 25-30 basis points in the weeks ahead, which should aid consumption ahead of the festive season.”', 'NS Satish, president, Haier Appliances, said: “I see this as a bazooka because you have the fiscal stimulus measures which have kicked in from April onwards and now you have the central bank’s measures to ease lending rates and give credit growth a boost.”', 'Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice-president, appliances business of Godrej Enterprises Group, said: “The rate cut by the RBI will provide EMI relief, especially to homebuyers with long-term loans.

This decision should add the equivalent of 2.5 trillion Indian Rupees of liquidity to the banking system."", 'According to Malhotra, this measure is intended to support bank lending to the productive sectors.', 'Despite the large stimulus, the central bank has tempered enthusiasm by changing its monetary policy stance: it is abandoning the ""accommodative"" stance adopted at the beginning of 2024 and returning to a ""neutral"" stance.', 'This change means that further interest-rate cuts are not on the agenda, unless there is a major turnaround in macroeconomic indicators.', '""From here onwards, the [Monetary Policy Committee] will be carefully assessing the incoming data and the evolving outlook to chart out the future course of monetary policy in order to strike the right growth-inflation balance,"" the RBI governor said, according to CNBC.', 'Analysts, surprised by this double rate cut, are generally of the opinion that the central bank should not cut rates any further in the short term, barring an external shock.', '""This big rate cut is, as the RBI Governor remarked, a front-loading of the rate cut. The change in monetary stance from accommodative to neutral also indicates that more rate cuts are unlikely unless the situation warrants"", said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Investments Ltd, according to Outlook Business.', 'Michael Wan, Senior Currency Analyst at MUFG, also shares a similar view:', '""The most important takeaway from the RBI meeting is that this is a front-loading of rate cuts, rather than a reassessment of a lower terminal rate, with lower inflation giving RBI policy space to bring forward the cuts,"" he shared in a research report.', 'However, the bank is maintaining its projection of a further RBI rate cut in December:', '""We keep our forecast for RBI to deliver another rate cut in 4Q2025 (calendar year), bringing the repo rate to 5.25% by December 2025, and we are implicitly forecasting a shift in timing rather than a more dovish rate profile. The next leg of the rate move will likely have to come from a downside inflation surprise, and this is effectively what we are forecasting with our expectation for inflation to average 3.4% in FY2025/26 (vs RBI\'s forecast of 3.7%),"" adds Wan.', 'The stock markets reacted immediately, with the Nifty50 index breaking through the symbolic 25,000-point barrier. In particular, the Nifty Bank, the index of banking stocks, set the tone with a spectacular gain of more than 800 points, buoyed by the prospect of a rise in credit volumes.', 'On the bond market, yields on 10-year government bonds fell, reflecting the easing of inflationary expectations and renewed confidence in the growth trajectory.', 'The Indian Rupee, on the other hand, came under slight downward pressure against the US Dollar (USD). While the fall in interest rates has made local credit cheaper, it has also made Rupee-denominated assets less attractive to foreign investors looking for yield.', 'The INR currency temporarily fell before stabilising. Some analysts believe that the pressure on the Indian Rupee could continue, especially if US interest rates remain high for much longer.', 'Beyond markets, it is Indian households, particularly the middle classes, who will feel the tangible effects of this monetary shift in their daily lives. ', 'With the cumulative fall of 100 basis points in the repo rate since February, variable-rate loans linked to the repo, which have become the norm for home loans since 2019, have seen their rates fall significantly.', 'At major banks, new home loans are now being offered at rates below 8%, the Indian Express notes. And this new central bank rate cut will further lower mortgage costs. These lower monthly repayments could encourage many households to bring forward their property or car projects, thereby supporting sustainable consumption, a crucial driver of growth for the Indian economy.', 'But this low interest rate policy is not without its drawbacks. Term deposits (FDs), highly prized by households for their security and guaranteed return, are likely to become much less attractive.', 'For retirees and cautious savers, this represents a real erosion of returns and purchasing power, especially if interest rates fall below inflation.', 'Swapnil Aggarwal, director of VSRK Capital, said, ""The reduction in interest rate will impact returns on fixed deposits, which were attractive during the high-rate period. With a decline in FD rates, we expect an increased shift in investors to mutual funds, debt instruments, and other market-linked products,"" according to Mint.', 'Mint also mentioned Vishal Goenka, co-founder of IndiaBonds.com, who said, ""A balanced policy encourages growth. Fixed deposit rates to come down sharply as banks transmit this rate cut. Investors should look at 2-3-year corporate bonds for their portfolio, as they continue to offer good spreads over government and FD rates, and interest rates will come down more gradually for corporate bonds.""', 'The surprise fall in interest rates and the massive release of liquidity via the reduction in the CRR mark a turning point that directly affects the lives of millions of Indians.', 'For the middle classes and young working people, these decisions mean more accessible credit, lower monthly repayments, and therefore an opportunity to realise long-delayed projects: buying a property, a car, studying, and sustainable consumption.', 'At the same time, small savers, particularly pensioners, have to prepare for lower returns on their deposits, which could push them towards riskier forms of investment.', 'The central bank has just reorganised the day-to-day economic balances: it favours those who borrow and invest for the long term, to the detriment of those who prefer to save without risk. ', ""In a country where access to credit remains a key vector of social mobility, the RBI's decision could therefore, if well transmitted, strengthen the momentum of domestic growth, provided that price stability is maintained and the banks play their part to the full."", '', 'Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

India Just Unleashed a $29 Billion Stimulus -- And Nobody Saw It Coming,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2912446/india-just-unleashed-a-29-billion-stimulus-and-nobody-saw-it-coming,"[""In a surprise double-punch to stimulate Asia's third-largest economy, the Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5% and lowered the cash reserve ratio by a full percentage point to 3%, injecting an estimated $29 billion of liquidity into the system. The decision, passed by a 5-1 vote, stunned markets and economists alike, especially given the central bank's simultaneous pivot from an “accommodative” to a “neutral” stance. Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized that the aggressive move was front-loaded to speed up transmission and support domestic growth, while cautioning that further easing would depend on future data."", 'Markets reacted with initial volatility before turning positive. Indian equities reversed earlier losses to gain as much as 1.1%, while short-term bond yields dropped and long-end yields ticked higher in response to the shift in policy stance. The rupee remained steady after a brief dip, as investors digested the mixed signals: a big policy push now, but with possibly fewer rate cuts ahead. Analysts at Bloomberg Economics suggested this move could lift sentiment and support an early-stage economic recovery, especially after credit growth slipped below 10%—a three-year low.', ""Still, the RBI retained its growth projection at 6.5% and cut its inflation forecast from 4% to 3.7%, citing softer consumer prices, favorable monsoon conditions, and stable oil prices. Finance officials, including India's Finance Secretary Ajay Seth, welcomed the move as a catalyst for private investment.

EXPLAINED",https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/rbi-repo-rate-cut-how-home-loan-emi-and-bank-fd-return-will-change-explained-11749190158107.html,"[""RBI repo rate cut: In a surprise move, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 50 BPS repo rate cut to 5.50 per cent on Friday. The RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, declared the higher-than-expected repo rate cut after the end of three days of the RBI MPC meeting. According to tax and investment experts, this will impact fresh home loan borrowers and bank fixed deposit (FD) account holders. They said that the RBI's repo rate cut decision is expected to bring relief for fresh home loan borrowers as their monthly EMI is expected to come down if banks pass on this relief to their customers. They said that the monthly home loan EMI calculator may show around ₹2,000 lower if a borrower has taken ₹50 lakh for 20 years. On the impact on bank FD investors, experts said that bank FD returns may yield lower after the RBI's repo rate move across tenors."", 'On how this RBI repo rate cut would impact one\'s monthly home loan EMI, Annuj Goel, Managing Director at Goel Ganga Developments, said, ""While the RBI\'s 50 bps repo rate cut has been audacious and visually bold in terms of allowing savings for its lenders, the repo rate N/O is at 5.5%, so home loan borrowers can save from the increase. This is how the product works: if you had a ₹50 lakh loan for 20 years, you could save somewhere in the neighbourhood ₹1,960 off the monthly EMI or just under ₹4.7 lakh over the life of the loan.""', 'On how much relief a home loan borrower would get if it has taken ₹30 lakh for 20 years, Aman Gupta, Director of RPS Group, said, ""Home loan borrowers with a ₹30 lakh loan of 20 years will see a decrease in their EMI of about ₹1,176 per month, and the best part is borrowers then have the choice they can either reduce their EMIs or as being discussed herein, retain their current EMI repayments to reduce the length of tenure and hence earn a greater interest saving.""', ""On the cumulative benefit that a fresh home loan borrower would be getting after the RBI's repo rate cut in 2025, Pankaj Mathpal, MD & CEO at Optima Money Managers, said, “The RBI has cut repo rate by 25 bps in February and April also. So 2025, the RBI has curtailed the repo rate by 100 bps (25 + 25 + 50) in 2025, which means those who have delayed their home-buying decisions in recent quarters have a great opportunity to buy their dream home as they would be getting around ₹3,800 to ₹4,000 p0epr month relief in their EMI on a home loan of ₹50 lakh for 20 years.”"", ""On how this repo rate cut move would impact bank FD rates, Pankaj Mathpal of Optima Money Managers said, “The repo rate cut is going to affect FD rates negatively as banks would cut FD rates across tenors once they pass on this repo rate cut decision to their customers. So, senior citizens and other bank FD investors are advised to book a bank FD account now, as a change in bank FD rates doesn't impact old bank FD accounts. If they fail to take this opportunity, they can look at time deposits in the post office small savings schemes.”"", 'Disclaimer: The views and recommendations provided in this analysis are those of individual analysts or broking companies, not Mint.

"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Bounty for Mr Market, strings attached",https://www.tradingview.com/news/moneycontrol:11342d5b3094b:0-moneycontrol-pro-panorama-bounty-for-mr-market-strings-attached/,"['Dear Reader,', 'The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.', 'The stock market has been clutching at straws of late. Geopolitics continues to be an overhang, with the wars continuing and Trump’s latest salvo on tariffs raising risks. Domestic earnings have been lacklustre even as GDP growth appears fine. Consumption presents a mixed picture as does capex revival. It is in this macro mix that RBI has injected some positivity, with a 50 basis point repo rate cut topped up with a 100 bps reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR).', 'A 25-basis point rate cut in this meeting and the next was the consensus. A frontloaded cut means near term rates will decline much more than if it had been phased out. Even with delayed transmission. Lower cost of funds benefits borrowers--corporates and more importantly, consumers. It lands during peak monsoon season, making farmers happy, but also well ahead of the festival season that benefits rural and urban consumers. The CRR cut will be done in phases starting September, right in time for the busy season.', 'The incremental macro impact of the CRR cut on liquidity may not be much, as the RBI’s focus on ensuring durable liquidity means that systemic liquidity is comfortable already. But it frees up funds for banks, which if deployed in higher yielding avenues improves the outlook for earnings. Since banks comprise a significant part of the market capitalization, it can boost key market indices and their underlying index funds, assuming other things remain constant. It’s no surprise then that the leaders among gainers are banks and NBFCs (their cost of funds will decline as well as they borrow from banks).', 'In today’s edition, we have a comprehensive coverage of the monetary policy decision, both from the macros, the banking sector, and equities. My colleague Neha Dave takes a comprehensive look at the macro picture that the MPC may have looked at, before arriving at its decision. She points to the fact that GDP growth and liquidity may have been comfortable, but a moderating outlook for inflation and the significant risks posed by geopolitics –chiefly tariffs—would have been a key reason for the frontloaded cuts.', 'Apart from this, domestic consumption also gave some reason for worry. Dave writes, ‘Both these factors – weaker private capex and muted urban consumption – are reflected in the banking system’s credit growth that has fallen to below 10% as of 16th May. As a broad-based and durable consumption recovery is increasingly critical for a revival in the private capex cycle, RBI has delivered a bumper rate cut and liquidity boost that in turn will increase credit offtake.’', 'Dinesh Unnikrishnan, my colleague who tracks the banking sector very closely, wisely asks us to not be too wide-eyed about the stimulus but to pay close attention to what the shift to a neutral stance means. He writes, ‘Despite the bold rate cut and CRR reduction, the neutral stance signals caution. Global trade frictions, including tariff wars, threaten supply chains and commodity prices. Domestically, erratic weather could spike vegetable prices, while rising metal costs may push wholesale inflation higher.’', 'Therefore, the same risks that necessitated monetary policy support could lead to higher inflation which can then become a headache, as the MPC is tasked with an inflation-targeting mandate. As Unnikrishnan points out, ‘Beyond the pro-growth moves, the key message is clear: the RBI is poised to pause, watch, and respond, balancing bold action with prudent caution.’', 'Finally, which sectors and stocks gain from the monetary stimulus will be of interest to our readers. The outsized monetary stimulus means that investors will gain a little more confidence on the outlook for equities. They write, ‘The expansionary monetary policy aims to invigorate both investment and consumption. More importantly, the injection of liquidity is expected to lower EMIs and borrowing costs, creating more discretionary cash for the middle class and MSMEs, thereby providing surplus cash for discretionary spending.’ While that’s a macro outlook, they map out the sectors that will benefit the most –housing, hotels, construction products, power are just a few—and then the stocks in these sectors that investors should keep a watch on. Don’t miss reading it.', 'One last thing. While the RBI has cut rates, US Fed chair Jay Powell has refused to be cowed down by Trump’s demand to cut rates even after his accusation of the Fed being ‘too late’. While Powell can take some solace in Musk now being in the same corner as him, after having publicly fallen out with Trump, today’s FT selection (exclusively for Pro subscribers) says that the Fed may have to do a rethink on rates if the data points in that direction. If that proves to be true, it could be more good news for domestic equity markets.', 'Investing insights from our research team', 'Weekly tactical pick: Does this pharma major merit a look despite the regulatory noises?', 'Voltas near-term outlook dims as market conditions turn unfavourable', 'Can a stationery brand drive growth beyond Its core strength?', 'What else are we reading?', 'Curing this costly addiction seems near impossible, regulating it is the next best option', 'India’s EV incentive scheme: Incumbents brace for competition', 'Is WTO looking at India to redeem itself?', 'Chart of the Day | Why Trump will continue to see red on steel imports', 'GuruSpeak | From Classroom to Candlesticks: How Gaurav Rakhonde became a full-time trader', 'ASEAN in the Crosshairs: Balancing great powers', 'Lessons in Leadership and Unity from Golwalkar: Shaping RSS ideology and succession', 'How medieval royals escaped the summer furnace', 'Vault Matters | Why Japanese and Middle East investors should be welcomed into the Indian banking sector', 'India’s Microbiome Moment: Where science meets tradition', 'Tech and Startups', 'GCC is truly successful when it becomes another headquarters: Accenture GCC head', 'Technical Picks: Bharat Forge, Bajaj Finance, REC, Bank Bees.Ravi AnanthanarayananMoneycontrol Pro', 'Select market data provided by ICE Data services.\nSelect reference data provided by FactSet.

"Same page: on monetary policy, the RBI, the Government  ",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/same-page-on-monetary-policy-the-rbi-the-government/article69665242.ece,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Updated - June 07, 2025 12:44 am IST', 'The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions, on Friday, show that the central bank is now unequivocally choosing growth in the perennial growth-inflation trade-off. This is the correct approach at this time. The first major decision was to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%. It comes on the back of two cuts of 25 basis points each, in February and April. With the latest retail inflation coming in at a 69-month low, and generally exhibiting a subdued trend, price stability has now been relegated as a secondary concern. These rate cuts will, once the banks transmit them to borrowers, make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow to invest and purchase. The second major decision, of slashing the cash reserve ratio by 100 basis points, will help with the transmission of the rate cuts. The less that banks have to keep with themselves, as stipulated by the cash reserve ratio, the more they can lend out — and now at lower rates. It is worth noting, however, that the central bank has again changed its stance. In April, it had moved from being neutral to being accommodative, indicating that it was inclined to cut rates further. It has now moved back to neutral, meaning more rate cuts in the short term are unlikely, unless growth falls well short of expectations. This is a sensible stance to take, given the vast uncertainties that the Indian and global economies are facing. The neutral stance also means that the RBI is equally predisposed to raise rates again in the event of an unforeseen and sustained spike in prices. The monsoon is yet to fully play out, after all.', 'The timing of these decisions is sound. Inflation is low and not likely to jump any time soon if current factors remain unchanged. Further, there are no major elections now that would otherwise have necessitated a pre-emptive strong grip on price levels. On the other hand, growth is lower than it could be. The RBI has projected growth in the current financial year 2025-26 to be 6.5%, which is no faster than what the government provisionally estimated for the previous year. Fiscal policy in terms of government spending has reached the limit of the stimulus it can provide. After a decade of increasing outlays, government capital expenditure can at best be maintained at the level it is at, but cannot reasonably be expected to grow much further. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and officials in the Ministry of Finance have indicated as much. Apart from developmental and social priorities, the government now has additional defence spending to account for. Monetary policy has to step up and boost growth, and it is good to see the RBI and the government on the same page.', '', '', 'Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Suppose you have a home loan of Rs 50 lakh at an interest rate of 8.5 per cent for a tenure of 20 years."", '', '', 'Your monthly EMI in this case would be around Rs 43,391.

The RBI\'s Monetary Policy Committee has changed the monetary policy\'s stance from ""accommodative"" back to ""neutral"". This the third straight rate cut by the central bank, following two previous ones in February and April, adds the report.', '', 'Vice Chairman, Arvind Ltd | Ex-Mckinsey | Harvard Business School, Stanford University', 'The RBI’s 50 bps repo rate cut to 5.5% is more than a policy signal—it’s a well-timed intervention that brings relief to families, confidence to markets, and renewed momentum to sectors like real estate and retail.\n\nHome loan rates falling below 7.75% changes the equation for many. For young families and first-time buyers, it increases the likelihood of owning a home. For existing borrowers, it creates breathing room on EMIs. \u2060Lower EMIs free up household budgets and boost discretionary spending, powering the economy forward.\n\nThis ‘hattrick’ rate cut reaffirms the central bank’s commitment to support growth, safeguard domestic demand and catalyse recovery.\n\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) #RBIPolicy #RBI #MPC #RepoRate', 'To view or add a comment, sign in', ""Founder@BASIC | BW40u40 | ET Social Enterpreneur'24"", ""I had the opportunity to speak on Money9’s expert panel alongside Janak Shah (Former Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India (RBI)) and Shubhada Rao (Chief Economist, YES Bank), where I shared my opinion on the implications of today’s repo rate cut by RBI on the housing industry.\n\nThe 50 bps rate cut is a clear signal of the RBI’s shift towards growth-oriented policy. This move not only improves liquidity in the system but also provides much-needed confidence to prospective homebuyers - particularly those who were sitting on the edge, waiting for affordability and clarity to improve.\n\nWith interest rates now expected to trend downward, EMIs will become more manageable for middle and lower-middle-income households. This will directly benefit the affordable housing segment, which remains the heart of India’s homeownership story. More liquidity also means banks and NBFCs will be more inclined to disburse loans, further easing access to formal credit.\n\nWe’re optimistic that this will accelerate home loan volumes, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where we continue to see strong demand. It also marks a meaningful step toward addressing India’s deep-rooted housing gap—especially when we remember that our country still has one of the highest numbers of homeless individuals in the world.\n\nThe rent vs. buy debate has always been nuanced, but this policy action decisively tips the scales toward ownership—backed by affordability, access, and aspiration.\n\nGrateful to be part of this timely conversation \nLooking forward to the momentum this move will bring to India's housing ecosystem.\n\n  "", 'To view or add a comment, sign in', '3,178,096 followers', ""Ms. Sakshi Gupta, Principal Economist at HDFC Bank shares her views on the RBI's credit policy.\n\n#HDFCBank #RBI #News"", 'To view or add a comment, sign in', '1,845,463 followers', 'Here’s the official statement from our Group CEO & MD, Dr. Anish Shah, on the recent RBI repo rate cut.', 'To view or add a comment, sign in', '316,167 followers', '#Essar’s leadership shares their perspective on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s latest Monetary Policy.\n\n#RBIPolicy #MonetaryPolicy \n\nIndian Ministry of Finance | Nirmala Sitharaman | Dhanpat Nahata | Srinivasan Vaidyanathan | Pankaj Kalra', 'To view or add a comment, sign in', 'Marketing & PR Head at Next Toppers | Featured in Times Square, New York as one of the Top 100 Women Marketing Leaders in India | Certified in Digital Marketing by the University of London', 'The Reserve Bank of India’s bold move to slash the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%—its third consecutive cut this year—signals an aggressive pivot toward growth stimulation amid easing inflationary pressures. With food inflation softening and core inflation expected to remain benign, the RBI seized the opportunity to front-load monetary easing. \n\nThe change in policy stance from “accommodative” to “neutral” reflects a recalibrated strategy: while liquidity support continues, the RBI is preparing to remain flexible should inflationary threats re-emerge. The simultaneous reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio, expected to release ₹2.5 lakh crore into the system, reinforces the central bank’s intent to amplify credit flow and investment activity across sectors.\n\nThis decision has wide-reaching consequences. Borrowers, especially in the housing and auto sectors, will see substantial relief through reduced EMIs—potentially saving thousands monthly—spurring consumer sentiment and retail spending. On the flip side, fixed deposit investors are already feeling the pinch of falling returns, a trade-off the RBI seems willing to make for broader economic revival. Stock markets have cheered the move, with the Nifty and Sensex posting gains as financials and real estate stocks surged. \n\nThe message from RBI is clear: with inflation under control and global headwinds persisting, India is choosing to bet on domestic demand, and this rate cut is a calculated push to accelerate the country’s growth engine while keeping inflation in check.\n\n#LinkedinNews #Finance #RBI #SanjayMalhotra #MPC #RepoRate', 'To view or add a comment, sign in', 'Chairman at ANAROCK Property Consultants Private Limited', 'This rate cut can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments.

However, a 19 per cent dip in unsold stock hints at sustained demand led by end-users. It will also lower developers’ borrowing costs. It is sincerely hoped that banks pass on the benefits of this move seamlessly to borrowers.\n\nThe reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) will help boost liquidity in the banking system, which means that banks have more funds to lend. Developers will be able to access more capital for their projects, and this can positively impact project completion timelines. It also gives banks the option to reduce home loan interest rates, which will have again positively impact sentiment in the affordable and mid-income segments\n\n#AffordableHousing #RealEstateIndia #RepoRate #RBI #HomeLoans\n#HousingMarket\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dkMa--en', 'To view or add a comment, sign in', ""Strategy Associate – CEO's Office"", ""Honestly, I think this was a masterstroke – and frankly, long overdue.\n\nLook, anyone who's been paying even a shred of attention to the economic data knew this was coming. It wasn't a question of if, but when, and frankly, how big the cut would be. \n\nThe clear signs that led to this:\n\nBefore the RBI acted, several big economic trends were telling them what to do:\n\n Low Inflation: The biggest reason was that prices weren't rising too fast. For a while now, inflation has been well below the RBI's target. This gave them the perfect chance to focus on other things, like helping the economy grow, without worrying about prices getting out of control.\n\n Slow Loan Growth: We saw that people and businesses weren't taking out many new loans. If loans aren't happening, businesses don't expand, and people don't spend as much. The rate cut aims to make borrowing cheaper, hoping to kickstart this.\n\n Global Worries: Even though India is growing well, there are challenges worldwide like trade fights and other countries slowing down. The rate cut is a way to make our own economy stronger so it can handle these outside problems better.\n \nEnough Money in Banks: The banks also had plenty of money to lend. This meant the RBI could cut rates, knowing banks would have the funds to actually pass on the lower rates to customers.\n\nHow this helps all of us\n\nThis rate cut isn't just about big economic numbers; it affects everyday people and businesses:\n\n For You and Me: The most direct benefit is potentially lower monthly payments (EMIs) on home, car, and personal loans. This leaves more money in your pocket, which you can then spend or save. It also makes buying a home more affordable, giving a much-needed boost to the housing market.\n\nFor Your Investments: If you invest, this is generally good news for the stock market. Companies can borrow money more cheaply, which helps their profits. Also, with fixed deposit rates likely to be lower, more people might put their money into stocks or other investments that offer better returns. Bonds also tend to do better when rates fall.\n\nFor Businesses and the Economy: The main goal is to encourage businesses to invest and people to spend. Cheaper loans mean companies are more likely to expand, buy new equipment, and hire more people. Companies with existing loans will also pay less interest, freeing up money for growth. All of this helps the economy grow faster overall.\n\nThis isn't just about domestic numbers; it's about making sure we're robust enough to weather the international storms. And frankly, it's about time we stopped being so damn conservative. When inflation is under control, you have to shift focus to growth. \n\n#LinkedinNews #Finance #RBI \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/duUxztG9"", 'To view or add a comment, sign in', 'Founder: PlusCash | Finark, Investor - Fintech, ISB', 'One Swipe of the RBI Pen, and EMIs Shrink\n\nImagine you’re a first-time home-buyer, mug of chai in hand, staring at a spreadsheet that just won’t balance.

What is Repo Rate? How Does it Affect the Economy?,https://www.homecredit.co.in/en/paise-ki-paathshala/detail/what-is-repo-rate-how-does-it-affect-the-economy,"['', '', 'Have you ever heard the term ""repo rate"" and wondered what it\'s all about? Well, you\'re not alone. Repo rates are an important concept in the world of finance and economics, and it has a significant impact on the economy. In this blog, we\'ll break down what repo rate is and how it affects the economy in simple terms.', 'First things first, let\'s demystify the term ""repo rate."" Repo is short for ""repurchase agreement,"" and the repo rate is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow money from the central bank, often called the ""lender of last resort."" In many countries, the central bank is responsible for controlling the money supply and ensuring the stability of the financial system.', 'So, when commercial banks need extra funds to meet their daily requirements or manage their reserves, they can approach the central bank to borrow money. The interest rate at which they borrow this money is the repo rate.', ""Imagine you're a commercial bank, and you need some cash to cover your short-term needs, like making payments to your customers. You can't borrow from just anyone; you go to the central bank. The central bank agrees to lend you the money, but you must promise to buy back the same amount of money, plus interest, at a later date. This is where the repo rate comes into play."", 'The repo rate is like the cost of borrowing money from the central bank. If the central bank sets a high repo rate, it becomes more expensive for commercial banks to borrow money. Conversely, a low repo rate means borrowing is more affordable.', ""Now, let's dive into how the repo rate affects the broader economy:"", '1. Influence on Interest Rates: The repo rate has a ripple effect on interest rates throughout the economy. When the central bank raises the repo rate, commercial banks often raise their own interest rates for loans to consumers and businesses. This, in turn, makes borrowing more expensive for everyone, leading to reduced spending on things like homes, cars, and investments.', '2. Controlling Inflation: One of the primary reasons central banks use the repo rate is to control inflation. When the economy is growing too fast, and prices are rising too quickly, the central bank may raise the repo rate. This makes borrowing more expensive, which can slow down spending and reduce inflation. On the flip side, if the economy is sluggish and inflation is too low, the central bank may lower the repo rate to encourage borrowing and spending.', '3. Impact on Savings: Changes in the repo rate also affect savings. When the central bank raises the repo rate, banks tend to offer higher interest rates on savings accounts, which is good news for savers. Conversely, when the repo rate drops, savings account interest rates may also decrease, leading to lower returns on your savings.', ""4. Exchange Rates: The repo rate can influence exchange rates as well. A higher repo rate can attract foreign investors seeking better returns on their investments, which can lead to an appreciation of the country's currency. Conversely, a lower repo rate can discourage foreign investment and lead to a weaker currency."", '5. Investment and Economic Growth: Businesses often rely on loans to fund expansion and investments. When the repo rate is high, borrowing becomes expensive, and businesses may delay or scale down their investments. Conversely, a lower repo rate can encourage businesses to borrow and invest in growth, potentially boosting economic activity.', ""In conclusion, the repo rate is a critical tool that central banks use to manage their country's economy. By changing the repo rate, central banks can influence borrowing costs, spending patterns, inflation rates, and more. Understanding how the repo rate works and its impact on the economy can help you make informed financial decisions and keep an eye on the broader economic trends that affect us all."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'In a world driven by constant change and economic uncertainties, the ability to make informed financial decisions is more crucial than ever.', '', '', 'In an era dominated by digital interactions, the convenience of online services comes with an inherent risk', '', '', ""In today's fast-paced world, managing finances can be a daunting task for working professionals."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Home Credit India']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXVSak0yWkhaSWRUVmhRbnBhVFJEVEF4aVFCU2dLTWdhMUZJYVBFUXM=-w280-h168-p-df
