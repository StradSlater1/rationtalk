Research from the University of Colorado Boulder found that there were more fires in the span of a 13-year period from 2005 to 2018 than in the previous 2 decades, with fire frequency doubling on the East and West coasts and quadrupling in the Great Plains regions.1 Certain regions have seen dramatic surges in wildfires in 2025 alone, including in Los Angeles County earlier this year and more recently in New Jersey’s Pinelands.2', 'There were more fires in the span of a 13-year period from 2005 to 2018 than in the previous 2 decades. | Image Credit: Erin - stock.adobe.com', 'Wildfires can have significant impacts on the respiratory health of those exposed to elevated levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).3 PM2.5 describes airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less, approximately 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. PM2.5 can be a mix of various substances, including dust or soot; biological matter such as pollen, bacteria, mold, or animal dander; and liquid or solid particles in aerosol.4', '“Wildfires generate intense air pollution composed of burned brush and trees. When the fires encroach into the wildland-urban interface, they can also include burned structures and vehicles,” May-Lin Wilgus, MD, a pulmonologist and associate clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in Los Angeles, California, said in an interview with Drug Topics. “The pollution includes fine particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, all of which can be transported in a smoke plume miles away from the actual fire.”', 'These particles are invisible to the naked eye, and as opposed to larger particles that may only reach the back of the throat, PM2.5 can travel deep into the lungs when inhaled. This means it can also penetrate the bloodstream, causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and damage to DNA.', '“When inhaled, the fine particulate matter in wildfire smoke particularly impacts the smaller airways. While anyone can experience respiratory symptoms from this type of exposure, people with existing lung disease such as asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] are most at risk of developing worsening airway inflammation and reactivity that manifests as an exacerbation of their lung condition,” Wilgus said. “In firefighters, there are associations between wildfire exposure and new-onset asthma and possibly between wildfire exposure and lung cancer; however, this has not been shown in the general population.”', 'During the Los Angeles County wildfires in January 2025, the CDC reported an 8-fold increase in emergency department visits, particularly in vulnerable populations including children and older adults.2 Common symptoms included shortness of breath, respiratory distress, and acute bronchitis.', '“In people with asthma or COPD, wildfire smoke exposure is associated with worse symptoms, increased medication use, and increased emergency department visits and hospitalizations,” Wilgus said. “During or after a wildfire, I often see patients with lung conditions presenting with worse cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. Some people returning to homes damaged by fire are also sensitive to exposure to residual ash in the home.”', 'Patients should be aware of the risks that wildfire smoke can pose to their health, particularly those with a preexisting lung condition.', '“The best measure is to avoid exposure, which may include evacuation when indicated. Otherwise, other measures include staying indoors, closing the doors and windows, running the HVAC [heating, ventilation, and air conditioning] for air filtration, and using HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters to clean indoor air,” Wilgus said.', 'Pharmacists can play a key role in assisting patients during public health crises such as wildfires. Patient education and emergency preparedness are 2 crucial ways they can contribute.', '“Clinicians should help counsel patients at risk from wildfire smoke exposure to be prepared with enough routine and emergency medications at home to avoid going outside,” Wilgus said. “They should also help patients with lung conditions develop an action plan to treat an exacerbation early, which may include rescue inhaler and nebulizer medications, and oral steroids if indicated. Pharmacists can be an important resource to help people who need extra medication for an exacerbation or because of an evacuation. They can also help patients who have limited access to supplies at home.”', 'Uninterrupted access to necessary medications is especially important for chronic conditions such as asthma and COPD. Pharmacists can help prevent patients from running out of medications by facilitating early refills. They can also help patients at risk avoid exposure to hazardous air conditions by offering curbside pickup options or coordinating mail-order deliveries.5', 'Pharmacists can also counsel them on wearing N95 or P100 masks correctly so they form a seal to the face, filtering out PM2.5 particles.6 Pharmacists can also help patients prepare for disasters by advising them on creating evacuation plans or preparing emergency medication kits in advance.', 'On a broader scale, pharmacists can also assist with public health efforts by participating in community screenings to assess the impact of wildfire smoke, which may include measuring vital signs and conducting surveys.7 These types of public health initiatives also provide an opportunity for medication counseling and patient education.', 'Although knowledge about the long-term effects of smoke from wildfires is still largely unknown, research is beginning to examine this topic in more detail. “The long-term effects and nonrespiratory effects of wildfire exposure remain mostly unknown, but this is an active area of investigation,” Wilgus said. “Recently, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with adverse cognitive effects and risk for dementia.”', 'These findings are from a 2024 study conducted by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle, who followed more than 1.2 million Kaiser Permanente Southern California members from 2008 to 2019.8 The study results also found that those in higher-poverty census tracts and racial and ethnic minority individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than higher-income or White patients.', 'Because PM2.5 penetrates the lungs and enters the bloodstream, it can also have profound impacts, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction. These effects, often combined with hot temperatures present during wildfires, can lead to increased rates of heart attacks. Research shows that exposure to dense smoke from wildfires has been associated with a 42% increase in emergency department visits for heart attacks and a 22% increased risk for ischemic heart disease within a day of exposure.9', 'In response to the fires in Los Angeles County in January 2025, a 10-year study, called the Los Angeles Fire Human Exposure and Long-Term Health Study, was launched to assess the long-term effects of wildfire smoke exposure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, reproductive, and immune system impacts.10 The study is a multi-institutional collaboration between researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts; the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health; the University of California, Davis; and The University of Texas at Austin.', 'Pharmacists play a crucial role in mitigating respiratory health issues caused by wildfire smoke.

At this threshold, children, seniors and those with pre-existing conditions are advised to avoid strenuous outdoor activity. Even healthy people may experience throat irritation or breathing difficulties after prolonged exposure.', 'For Lobb, when the AQHI hits 10 or 11, daily life comes to a halt. Instead, she stays indoors, carefully monitors her symptoms and listens closely to her body. “That’s all I can do,” she says.', 'Across the region, nearly 30,000 people in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been evacuated as wildfires continue to burn. Environment and Climate Change Canada reports that the heaviest smoke plumes are concentrated over central Manitoba and northwestern Ontario but have drifted south into the U.S. and even as far as Europe.', '', '“It’s hard sometimes living with these invisible illnesses … Especially when they don’t fall neatly under the usual labels like asthma or COPD.”\n–Carol Lobb', '', 'While wildfire smoke can affect anyone’s health, even brief exposure poses greater risks to vulnerable groups such as older adults, young children, pregnant individuals and those with chronic illnesses.', 'Wildfire smoke is a complex blend of gases, water vapour and particles of different sizes. While larger particles can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, the most concerning lies with fine particles known as PM2.5. These microscopic particles measure less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter — roughly 1/70 the width of a human hair — making them invisible to the naked eye.', 'Dr. Scott Weichenthal, associate director of the McGill Centre for Climate Change and Health and professor in McGill’s department of epidemiology, biostatistics and occupational health, says the most common early symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. Some people may also experience coughing, wheezing or overall respiratory discomfort.', '', 'Supplied', 'Dr. Scott Weichenthal, of McGill University, warns the smallest particles from wildfire smoke can even enter the bloodstream.', '', 'But PM2.5 particles, generated during combustion, are especially concerning because they can travel through your lungs and even enter the bloodstream, potentially contributing to a range of health issues.', '“Once inhaled, PM2.5 particles can reach deep within our lungs as well as our systemic circulation,” Weichenthal says. “These particles increase inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, impact our autonomic nervous system, blood coagulation, vascular function and other mechanisms broadly relevant to our overall health.”', 'A recent study in Environmental Science & Technology, a journal published by the American Chemical Society, analyzed wildfire seasons in B.C. from 2016 to 2019. Researchers found that infants whose mothers were exposed to wildfire smoke during pregnancy had a higher likelihood of developing ear infections and lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, within their first year of life.', 'While many symptoms may appear mild at first, Weichenthal stresses that the health risks of wildfire smoke extend beyond short-term respiratory issues, potentially leading to long-term health consequences, including cancer.', '“Wildfire smoke contains many known human carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic metals. The exact composition depends on what’s burning — whether it’s forests, buildings, or other materials,” he says. “Either way, it’s a toxic mix of harmful components that poses significant risks to public health. We have much to learn about the long-term health risks of fires.”', '', '“The key strategy is to reduce exposure. The more we can reduce population exposures, the more we can mitigate potential health risks.”\n–Dr. Scott Weichenthal', '', 'Given these serious public health implications, Weichenthal has been vocal about the need for greater awareness and action.', 'In the April 2025 issue of Nature Reviews Cancer, Weichenthal published an article titled “We cannot ignore the cancer risks of wildfires.” In it, he highlights the increased cancer risk linked to repeated wildfire exposure in regions affected annually and advocates for practical, science-backed measures — such as using indoor air filtration — to help reduce harmful exposures.', '“Unfortunately, we will be dealing with this issue for the rest of our lives,” he says. “The key strategy is to reduce exposure. The more we can reduce population exposures, the more we can mitigate potential health risks.”', 'Weichenthal’s warning underscores the lasting impact wildfire smoke can have on people’s health, especially those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.', 'For Julia Frankfurt, 43, who lives with asthma and chronic seasonal allergies triggered by environmental factors, wildfire smoke adds another layer of difficulty to managing her symptoms.', '“I have to be very fluid,” she says. “Fortunately, I have the kind of job where I can work from home, and I have an air purifier here.”', '', 'MIKAELA MACKENZIE / FREE PRESS', 'Julia Frankfurt feels the effects of wildfire smoke acutely enough, it can lead to a trip to an emergency room.', '', 'But when she’s at the office, things are more complicated. “We can only reduce it to about 10 per cent outside air, because there still has to be some external air coming in. I can’t restrict the doors from opening, so you can smell the smoke inside the building.”', 'The smoky air has made breathing more difficult, pushing her to rely more on her medication.', '“I’m breathing heavily through my lungs pretty much every day,” she says. “I’ve had to increase how often I use my inhalers to offset some of the symptoms. If it gets bad and my chest gets really tight, I’ll have to go to the ER for a nebulizer treatment.”', 'Even before the smoke smells strong, she feels its effects.', '“When the smoke is on its way, I’ll lose my voice within five to 10 minutes. I can feel it deep in my lungs. And then I start getting wheezy and my chest gets heavy.”', '', '“Leading with kindness and understanding is so important. It might not seem like much from the outside, but it means everything to those who are struggling.”\n–Julia Frankfurt', '', 'And it’s not just her lungs. “My eyeballs feel like they’ve got sand in them pretty much every day since fire season started. I buy eye drops and have to keep hydrating because they’re so itchy.”', 'When air quality drops, the most important thing Manitobans can do is stay informed and reduce their exposure as much as possible.', '“The first step is to be aware of the air quality in your area. Tools like the AQHI developed by Health Canada and Environment Canada are an excellent resource,” Weichenthal says.', 'When the AQHI shows a high risk, people are advised to stay indoors, keep windows closed and use a high-efficiency (HEPA) air purifier to filter out harmful particles. For those who need to be outside — such as construction or delivery workers — a properly fitted N95 mask can offer added protection against fine particles.', 'There are also do-it-yourself solutions available: “You can find instructions online to build your own air purifier (using a box fan and a furnace filter) with materials found at hardware stores,” Weichenthal adds.', 'For Frankfurt, wildfire smoke isn’t just a health concern — it also takes an emotional toll.', '', 'WEEKDAY EVENINGS', 'Today’s must-read stories and a roundup of the day’s headlines, delivered every evening.', '', '“I don’t know if it counts as anxiety or stress, but I just feel disappointed,” she says. “We don’t have a long summer, and I want to be outside. I love being in my garden. It’s really frustrating not being able to do what I love.”', 'That frustration can also feel isolating, especially when others don’t fully grasp the impact.', '“There are always people who say, ‘Oh, it’s not that bad.’ I’m glad it’s not that bad for them, but for some of us, it’s much harder,” she explains. “You can’t always see conditions like asthma unless someone’s using an inhaler or wearing a mask. For me, people only notice when my voice changes.

Patients who were exposed to higher levels of fine particulate matter from wildfire air pollution had a 20% greater risk of cancer-related death.', '', '“The research tells us that there are small particles in the air that could make lung cancer worse,” Surbhi Singhal, MD, of the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in a news release. “As wildfires become more frequent and intense in California and other parts of the U.S., we need targeted health strategies to protect cancer patients and others with serious health problems. These results highlight the urgent need to protect vulnerable populations living in wildfire-prone regions.”', 'Air pollution from wildfires contains tiny harmful particles known as PM2.5, meaning fine particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which can penetrate deep into the lungs. Prior research has shown that PM2.5 exposure is associated with a greater risk of developing cancer, but its impact on survival of patients who already have lung cancer is unclear.', '', 'The researchers identified all patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the California Cancer Registry between 2017 and 2020. The cohort included more than 18,500 people with a mean age of 70 years. Daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated based on air quality monitoring, satellite observations, meteorological modeling, predictive smoke modeling and low-cost sensors. Exposure was estimated as average daily PM2.5 levels during the year after NSCLC diagnosis.', '', 'The study showed that, overall, higher mean daily PM2.5 exposure during the 12 months after diagnosis was associated with a 20% increased risk of cancer-related death. This rose to 36% for patients no prior history of tobacco smoking and to 55% for never-smokers with Stage IV (metastatic) disease, compared with a smaller 17% rise for current or former smokers. That is, although smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, wildfire smoke exposure had a relatively greater effect on nonsmokers. Surprisingly, however, current or former smokers with Stage IV lung cancer who received immunotherapy actually had improved cancer survival with more days of high PM2.5 exposure.', '', '“In this large population-based NSCLC cohort, wildfire-dominated PM2.5 exposure after diagnosis was independently associated with increased risk of cancer-related death,” the researchers concluded. “As the size and frequency of wildfires increases, our findings have important public health and clinical implications for patients with NSCLC.”', '', 'Click here for more reports from ASCO 2025.', 'Read More About:', '', 'COMMENTS', 'Email updates from Cancer Health', 'Poll: Do you have medical debt?', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Fighting Cancer', '', '', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iNkNnNVhNRVowY2xGM1lqZGFibGRpVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWc0QkFJemxCR1l1QnlwMndLSklGUQ=-w280-h168-p-df
