But when Irsay died, the plan was always to keep the franchise in the family and pass the Colts down to his daughters. It was simply a formality for Irsay-Gordon, Foyt and Jackson to take over, and Monday’s announcement was more so about providing clarity of their forthcoming roles than reacting to any earth-shattering news.', '', 'The decision for Irsay-Gordon to step in as the principal owner falls right in line with the position Irsay prepared her for over several years. The eldest of Irsay’s three daughters, Irsay-Gordon will likely shoulder most of the decision-making from a football operations standpoint.', 'One looming question that shifts from her father to her: Just how much patience does she have for Ballard?

This young man fell far from the parental tree."", 'He was a great friend to the Baltimore Colts, and we will miss him.', 'May he rest in peace.', 'JOHN LOPEZ (Athletic Trainer): In time, Jimmy became the keeper of the flame of what ""Colt Football"" was all about.

I've always been impressed by how he rose above that adversity and embraced our team, The Baltimore Colts, with open arms."", ""Jim was like a younger brother, blessed with an exceptional heart, and was always there to help anyone out in any way he could.

I remember, like it was yesterday, how this young guy hung out in my room and in Bert's room at training camp. I remember how generous he was, even at that young age."", ""And I remember how much he genuinely cared about people.

While we reflect on the passing of team owner Jim Irsay, who had significant influence on building the physical plant and identity of modern Indianapolis, we have the luxury of knowing that three more Irsays are in a position to continue that work and stewardship of the team. Daughters Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Kalen Jackson and Casey Foyt already are co-owners of the team and have been entrenched for years as high-level executives. In particular, Irsay-Gordon has been so deeply involved in every aspect of football operations that it’s widely assumed she will claim the role of controlling owner. These women have spent much of their adult lives preparing for this eventuality, but experts maintain that succession in professional sports is always a challenge, regardless of the circumstances.', 'Jim Irsay seemed very comfortable in the public eye and as a sometimes larger-than-life figure. His daughters have kept much lower profiles—so much so that many casual fans probably aren’t aware of their existence. In this week’s podcast, we’re going to try to change that. IBJ has interviewed both Carlie and Kalen in past years, and we’ll share excerpts from those interviews that are relevant to this moment. We also have comments from one of the team’s on-field leaders about his experiences with Irsay-Gordon and Jackson. Our in-studio guest is IBJ’s Mickey Shuey, who has a story in the latest issue of IBJ about the ways the three sisters bcame key figures in the franchise. He also explores how the NFL typically handles succession issues and what financial concerns the daughters likely will face moving forward.', 'Click here to find the IBJ Podcast each Monday.
