Who will take home a Tony Award? Here's what our experts think,https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/theater/2025/06/04/2025-tony-awards-these-nominees-our-experts-pick-winners/83596976007/,"['Singing robots? Only on Broadway — and they just might dominate the Tony Awards.', 'Starring Darren Criss and Helen J. Shin, ""Maybe Happy Ending"" has already won best musical awards from the Drama League, the Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and New York Drama Critics Circle.', 'The innovative show about a chance encounter between two ""helperbots"" that sparks adventure and maybe even love has been nominated for 10 Tonys, including Best Musical.', 'The 78th annual Antoinette Perry ""Tony"" Awards take place at 8 p.m. Sunday, June 8, from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. Hosted by Tony, Emmy and Grammy Award winner (and three-time Oscar nominee) Cynthia Erivo, you can watch the show on CBS and Paramount+. Criss and Tony and Grammy winner Renée Elise Goldsberry will host ""Act One"" of the Tony Awards, a live pre-show, on Pluto TV starting at 6:40 p.m.', ""It's worth noting that the Isabelle Stevenson Tony Award will be presented to Celia Keenan-Bolger, and that the legendary Harvey Fierstein will receive the Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre."", 'Do our critics Ilana Keller and Bill Canacci both love Harvey? Yes.', 'Will they agree on what shows, actors, directors and artists will win this year? Unlikely.', ""But let's give it go."", '""English,"" Sanaz Toossi', '""The Hills of California,"" Jez Butterworth', '""John Proctor is the Villain,"" Kimberly Belflower', '""Oh, Mary!,"" Cole Escola', '""Purpose,"" Branden Jacobs-Jenkins', 'Ilana Keller: So many good choices. Jacobs-Jenkins\' ""Purpose,"" about the twisted dynamics of an upper middle class Black family, just won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. ""Oh, Mary!"" a raucous retelling of Mary Todd Lincoln\'s life, was a finalist this year. ""English"" and ""John Proctor is the Villain"" tackle issues that could not be more in the forefront of today\'s society, while ""The Hills of California"" is another family saga that examines complicated relationships — and it was nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Play before transferring to Broadway from the West End. Like this year\'s Pulitzers (I can compare myself to the Pulitzers, right?), I have to give the nod to ""Purpose,"" but I would not be super upset with any of the choices here.', 'Bill Canacci: I think this comes down to ""English,"" ""John Proctor"" and ""Purpose."" I\'m taking ""English,"" winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Taking place in a a classroom in Iran, adult students prepare for the TOEFL: Test of English as a Foreign Language. While learning the language will certainly open doors, the students find themselves thinking about their native language and culture. While the audience is thinking about what they say, it is also reflecting on our culture, our country and the state of the world. So, Ilana, two Pulitzer Prize winners take each other on. Should be interesting.', ""IK: For sure. We've been quite lucky with the caliber of creation these last few seasons."", '""Buena Vista Social Club""', '""Dead Outlaw""', '""Death Becomes Her""', '""Maybe Happy Ending""', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical""', 'BC: So the last two years, Ilana, have not been great for me in this category. Both ""Some Like it Hot"" and ""Illinoise"" lost to shows that I think were not nearly as good. And I fear that\'s going to happen again. While I liked ""Maybe Happy Ending,"" I did not love it as much as ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" which like the robots, has been nominated for 10 Tonys. It\'s been criticized for a weak book, but I would disagree. And the music, the choreography, the band, are first-rate. There\'s not much to be said about the other shows. ""Dead Outlaw"" received a lot of buzz off-Broadway last year, but I was unimpressed. ""Operation Mincemeat"" takes awhile to get going, but is a fun night at the theater. I\'ll let you tell me why you think ""Death Becomes Her"" belongs in this category.', 'IK: You often seem unimpressed with a lot of my work, and I happen to think it\'s usually very good, soooo ... Anyway, I agree that ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is really something special. The way the show\'s elements melded together onstage formed something rare, a seamless blend of all-consuming storytelling. ""Maybe Happy Ending"" managed to perfect the art of small, wowing with feeling rather than spectacle — although when it does bring in the spectacle, it\'s pretty special. ""Dead Outlaw"" is unlike anything else out there — and its strangest element just may be the truth to its story. ""Operation: Mincemeat"" is another West End gem that Broadway audiences are lucky enough to share in. And ""Death Becomes Her""? Why do I need to explain that joy, laughter and stagecraft are good things? And it was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, too! That said, I give this one to ""Maybe Happy Ending.""', '""Eureka Day""', '""Romeo + Juliet""', '""Thornton Wilder\'s Our Town""', '""Yellow Face""', 'IK: Fun fact: Both ""Eureka Day"" and ""Yellow Face"" are nominated in the Best Revival category, despite never having appeared on Broadway previously. That is thanks to the so-called ""classics"" rule, which means that a show is considered part of the theater canon (in the historical or popular repertoire) even though it has not been on Broadway before. ""Yellow Face,"" which examines cultural appropriation, first appeared off-Broadway in 2007, while the vaccine debate of ""Eureka Day"" played off-Broadway in 2019. Last year\'s Best Revival of a Play winner, Jacobs-Jenkins\' \'""Appropriate,"" also appeared in the category thanks to the classics rule. Now that that\'s out of the way, I\'m going to have to go with credit for re-imagining here, and give this one to the bold (and quasi-musical) ""Romeo + Juliet,"" though all entrants were more than worthy of their nominations, giving audiences something to chew on long after they left the theater.', 'BC: As much as I enjoyed ""Romeo + Juliet,"" this production of ""Our Town"" was the best I\'ve ever seen. And yes, Jim Parsons was amazing, but the rest of the cast was excellent, the staging was beautiful. It\'s one to remember.', 'IK: Do I lose my Broadway card if I reveal that (SOMEHOW?!) this was the first full production of ""Our Town"" I\'ve seen live?', ""BC: You do. I'll finish this on my own."", '""Floyd Collins""', '""Gypsy""', '""Pirates! The Penzance Musical""', '""Sunset Blvd.""', 'BC: I enjoyed each of these shows, but I think ""Gypsy"" should win. Audra McDonald is amazing as always, but the rest of the cast is very good. My No. 2 would be ""Sunset Blvd."" Is it good theater? No. But it is great entertainment and lots of fun. ""Floyd Collins"" is striking, but a friend said it best: It would be better as an opera. ""Pirates"" is a great way to forget your troubles and just have a good time.', 'IK: So shockingly, our thought process is nearly opposite here. That never happens, right? Each of these revivals is incredible in its own right, but I have to give ""Pirates"" an edge for its complete reimagining of time and place. 1880s New Orleans just works, and it\'s pretty wonderful that a 150-year-old piece can feel so new and so fun, without any major changes to its storyline or music.', 'BC: I see you are still taking part.', '""Buena Vista Social Club,"" Marco Ramirez', '""Dead Outlaw,"" Itamar Moses', '""Death Becomes Her,"" Marco Pennette', '""Maybe Happy Ending,"" Will Aronson and Hue Park', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical,"" David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', 'IK: ""Maybe Happy Ending"" is original and clever, and again, the amount of feeling infused into and created by robots, of all things, is pretty remarkable. That said, I wouldn\'t be surprised by some stiff (sorry!) competition from ""Dead Outlaw"" or ""Operation Mincemeat.""', 'BC: Oh, Ilana. You just can\'t resist. I\'ll give this one to ""Maybe Happy Ending,"" just because it\'s surprising how robots manage to make you think about friendship, relationships, even childhood.', '""Dead Outlaw,"" David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna', '""Death Becomes Her,"" Julia Mattison and Noel Carey', '""Maybe Happy Ending,"" Music: Will Aronson, Lyrics: Will Aronson and Hue Park', '""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical,"" Music & Lyrics: David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', '""Real Women Have Curves: The Musical,"" Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', 'BC: Ilana, can I pick ""Buena Vista Social Club"" for this?', 'IK: I mean, you COULD, but....', 'BC: Well, as much as I enjoyed ""Real Women Have Curves"" I think ""Maybe Happy Ending"" deserves it.', 'IK: I would also love to see ""Real Women Have Curves"" take this home, but I agree. Ack, we agree.', 'Laura Donnelly, ""The Hills of California""', 'Mia Farrow, ""The Roommate""', 'LaTanya Richardson Jackson, ""Purpose""', 'Sadie Sink, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Sarah Snook, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'IK: I can\'t tell you how many times I have seen people coming out of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" remarking not only on the job being done by Sarah Snook, but on the fact that she does it eight times a week. A solo show is its own kind of Everest, nevermind one where the actor is playing more than two dozen Oscar Wilde characters.', 'BC: This one is a no-brainer. Snook is incredible.', 'George Clooney, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'Cole Escola, ""Oh, Mary!""', 'Jon Michael Hill, ""Purpose""', 'Daniel Dae Kim, ""Yellow Face""', 'Harry Lennix, ""Purpose""', 'Louis McCartney, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'BC: ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" made Broadway history recently with an eight-performance gross of $4,238,813, breaking the $4,041,493 record set by ""Hamilton"" in 2018, according to Deadline. The average ticket price for ""Good Night"" was $337.59, with premium seats going for $825. And it\'s certainly worth seeing. But as good as Clooney is, I\'m giving this to Louis McCartney. He goes from an introverted teenager to a monster, shaking and convulsing and terrifying along the way. We see Henry battling the demon inside, trying to stay, well, human.', 'IK: I think we agree. Again. Let\'s not make a habit of it. But ""Stranger Things"" is like nothing else on Broadway, and helming it masterfully, with all of its technical aspects — in addition to the character arc — would be a challenge for any seasoned stage actor. McCartney is 21, and the show\'s London production was his West End debut.', 'Megan Hilty, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'Audra McDonald, ""Gypsy""', 'Jasmine Amy Rogers, ""BOOP! The Musical""', 'Nicole Scherzinger, ""Sunset Blvd.""', 'Jennifer Simard, ""Death Becomes Her""', ""IK: I suppose a five-way tie is out of the question. Already the record-holder for acting Tony Awards, I'd love to see this give Audra McDonald her seventh. There's been some criticism alleging her (incredible) voice isn't right for the role, but that's exactly why I think she comes out ahead. For a role already embodied by so many brilliant women, it'd be easy to emulate — instead, this is HER Rose."", ""BC: McDonald is amazing. Period. There should be no criticism about her or her voice. Ever. She deserves yet another Tony. Having said that, I completely understand if Scherzinger would win. I have never seen two standing ovations in the middle of a show. She is fabulous. Ilana, I can't resist, I'm ready for my close-up."", ""IK: I'll alert Mr. Ziegfeld. Oh wait, wrong musical."", 'Darren Criss, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Andrew Durand, ""Dead Outlaw""', 'Tom Francis, ""Sunset Blvd.""', 'Jonathan Groff, ""Just in Time""', 'James Monroe Iglehart, ""A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical""', 'Jeremy Jordan, ""Floyd Collins""', 'BC: This is a tough one. For me it comes down to Francis and Groff, who won last year in this category for ""Merrily We Roll Along."" Ilana, I just can\'t decide.', 'IK: OK, so you can agree with me and go with Darren Criss. Becoming a believable robot, without turning in a stiff performance, isn\'t easy. Yes, my second stiff pun of this piece. You\'re welcome. Puns aside, Iglehart may be a bit of a wild card, but his Armstrong was something to behold. A Tony winner for ""Aladdin\'s"" Genie, his range is astronomical and it\'s always a treat when he returns to the stage.', 'BC: All good performances here. I admit I did not consider Criss. OK, I\'ve thought some more and I\'m going to take Francis. It says a lot that I remembered him as much as the diva in ""Sunset Blvd."" And he leads the opening of Act II, which is one of the best moments of the season. The place goes crazy.', 'Tala Ashe, ""English""', 'Jessica Hecht, ""Eureka Day""', 'Marjan Neshat, ""English""', 'Fina Strazza, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Kara Young, ""Purpose""', 'IK: Is there anything Kara Young can\'t do? This is incredibly her fourth-straight year of being nominated in this category, and she took home the Tony last year for ""Purlie Victorious."" I\'d love to see her walk away with it again, though Strazza will put up a fight.', ""BC: Young is so talented. In fact, I think she is too talented for this role. Jessica Hecht will get a lot of consideration. For me, I'm taking Tala Ashe, who brings out the passion in Elham, a character who does not like English but knows she needs it to get ahead."", 'Glenn Davis, ""Purpose""', 'Gabriel Ebert, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Francis Jue, ""Yellow Face""', 'Bob Odenkirk, ""Glengarry Glen Ross""', 'Conrad Ricamora, ""Oh, Mary!""', 'BC: Not a strong category. Ilana, can I pass?', 'IK: Francis Jue made his return to Broadway in ""Yellow Face"" after nearly two decades, and he was part of the off-Broadway run of the show in the same role 17 years ago. He was able to imbue his lived experience into the role, adding an important voice to an important subject. I think that bled into his performance here, and would love to see him take home the Tony.', 'BC: I\'ll give it to Conrad Ricamora, who I thought was the best part of ""Oh, Mary!"" But I\'m guessing the voters will give this one to Odenkirk.', 'Natalie Venetia Belcon, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Julia Knitel, ""Dead Outlaw""', 'Gracie Lawrence, ""Just in Time""', 'Justina Machado, ""Real Women Have Curves: The Musical""', 'Joy Woods, ""Gypsy""', 'IK: Ooof, so much talent here. I have to go with Justina Machado. ""Real Woman Have Curves"" is such a delight, and in many ways, Machado plays against the flow in her character arc. It\'s certainly no easy feat. But these are all unforgettable performances, and it\'s another case of honestly seeing any of these women pull off a deserved win.', ""BC: I would be very happy for just about all of these nominees. I think the frontrunners are Lawrence and Belcon, but I'm going to take Belcon. She turns in a mighty performance of famed Cuban singer Omara Portuondo."", 'Brooks Ashmanskas, ""SMASH""', 'Jeb Brown, ""Dead Outlaw""', 'Danny Burstein, ""Gypsy""', 'Jak Malone, ""Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical""', 'Taylor Trensch, ""Floyd Collins""', 'BC: Another tough one. Jak Malone is a wonder, and Burstein is as good as ever. Taylor Trensch is far and away the best thing about ""Floyd Collins."" He gets my vote. And if he wins, I hope he says something nice about the late Gavin Creel. The two of them starred in the sensational 2017 revival of ""Hello, Dolly!"" It would be a nice moment.', 'IK: I think Jak Malone takes this one.', 'BC: Malone changes the show after his performance of ""Dear Bill."" It\'s tender and sweet and sad and beautiful. You\'re right, he will likely win. But I\'m still pulling for Trensch.', 'Knud Adams, ""English""', 'Sam Mendes, ""The Hills of California""', 'Sam Pinkleton, ""Oh, Mary!""', 'Danya Taymor, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Kip Williams, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'IK: ""The Hills of California"" is a behemoth of a show, and Mendes does what he does best, sinking into a complex story with deftness and dexterity.', 'BC: This is a tough one. I think Mendes may win, but my heart is with Knud Adams and ""English."" I loved the show when I saw it off-Broadway in 2022, and it did not miss a beat in this Roundabout production.', 'Saheem Ali, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Michael Arden, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'David Cromer, ""Dead Outlaw""', 'Christopher Gattelli, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'Jamie Lloyd, ""Sunset Blvd.""', 'BC: So I can see people voting for ""Sunset Blvd."" and ""Maybe Happy Ending."" I\'m going to pick ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" and come away disappointed.', 'IK: I mentioned the blending of elements that made ""Buena Vista Social Club"" so special and that\'s largely due to Ali and his vision. Would also love to see the win here.', 'Joshua Bergasse, ""SMASH""', 'Camille A. Brown, ""Gypsy""', 'Christopher Gattelli, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'Jerry Mitchell, ""BOOP! The Musical""', 'Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'IK: ""Boop!"" and ""SMASH"" both provided many moments of musical theater bliss, but once again, ""Buena Vista Social Club"" provided something unexpected. Something different than everything else out there, something special that trancended dance.', 'BC: This one should be no contest. What Delgado and Peck create is special. It\'s exciting to watch something so energetic and beautiful. I will agree that Jerry Mitchell is brilliant, but ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is in another league.', 'Andrew Resnick and Michael Thurber, ""Just in Time""', 'Will Aronson, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Bruce Coughlin, ""Floyd Collins""', 'Marco Paguia, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber, ""Sunset Blvd.""', ""BC: I wonder what show I'll pick, Ilana?"", 'IK: Usually you pick a show that wasn\'t nominated, to provide the ultimate kvetch. ""Buena Vista Social Club"" is a treat to the senses.', 'BC: Yes it is. But if I had to guess, I\'d say ""MHE"" will win.', 'Marsha Ginsberg, ""English""', 'Rob Howell, ""The Hills of California""', 'Marg Horwell and David Bergman, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'Miriam Buether and 59, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'Scott Pask, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'IK: ""Stranger Things"" took us on a journey in so many senses of the word, and the set design worked seamlessly to craft the span of settings.', 'BC: Let me say how much I liked Marsha Ginsberg\'s work, but ""Stranger Things"" should win. It impressed on so many levels, I want to see it again — and that does not happen often. And good news, Ilana! Season 5 of the popular Netflix series is coming in November. I\'m counting down the days.', 'IK: Are you playing the villain?', 'BC: Rude.', 'Rachel Hauck, ""Swept Away""', 'Dane Laffrey and George Reeve, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Arnulfo Maldonado, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Derek McLane, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'Derek McLane, ""Just in Time""', 'BC: This one seems to be a sure win for ""Maybe Happy Ending."" The complex visual design, featuring video projections and LED technology, is impressive.', 'IK: I agree, although I think ""Swept Away"" may be a dark horse.', 'BC: That moment when the ship sinks is a highlight of the season, no doubt.', 'Brenda Abbandandolo, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'Marg Horwell, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'Rob Howell, ""The Hills of California""', 'Holly Pierson, ""Oh, Mary!""', 'Brigitte Reiffenstuel, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'IK: ""Stranger Things"" spanned decades, and the costumes helped ground time and place. Not to mention the otherworldly.', 'BC: I agree, and would love to give them this award ... but I\'m taking ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Snook plays so many characters, but Marg Horwell helps make that happen.', 'Dede Ayite, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Gregg Barnes, ""BOOP! The Musical""', 'Clint Ramos, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Paul Tazewell, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'Catherine Zuber, ""Just in Time""', 'BC: A part of me wants to give this to ""BOOP!"" but I\'m giving it to ""Buena Vista Social Club.""', 'IK: ""BOOP!"" — if not only because of one particular dance moment/reveal that may be the most fun of the year. While not the only reason I think it should win, it certainly made an impression.', 'BC: Agree that the black-and-white/color number was lots of fun, but I\'ll stick with ""BVSC.""', 'Natasha Chivers, ""The Hills of California""', 'Jon Clark, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'Heather Gilbert and David Bengali, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'Natasha Katz and Hannah Wasileski, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Nick Schlieper, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'IK: ""Stranger Things."" While I don\'t generally condone audience botherment, the start of the show alone was enough to force one audience member to leave his seat.', 'BC: Is botherment a word, Ilana? Not that I\'m dropping names, but Tom Hanks sat in front of me when I saw ""Stranger Things."" He seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. Clark deserves the win.', 'Jack Knowles, ""Sunset Blvd.""', 'Tyler Micoleau, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Scott Zielinski and Ruey Horng Sun, ""Floyd Collins""', 'Ben Stanton, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Justin Townsend, ""Death Becomes Her""', 'BC: Let\'s give this one to ""Sunset Blvd."" Ilana, I\'m still ready for my close-up.', 'IK: Agreed. Also, Max Bialystock awaits your call.', 'Paul Arditti, ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow""', 'Palmer Hefferan, ""John Proctor is the Villain""', 'Daniel Kluger, ""Good Night, and Good Luck""', 'Nick Powell, ""The Hills of California""', 'Clemence Williams, ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""', 'IK: Once again, ""Stranger Things"" impressed in its world-building, and sound design is no exception. And I won\'t divulge which, of course, but one of the nominees gets my vote for my least favorite sound-related moments of the season.', 'BC: I think I know which one you mean. But ""Stranger Things"" should win this easily.', 'Jonathan Deans, ""Buena Vista Social Club""', 'Adam Fisher, ""Sunset Blvd.""', 'Peter Hylenski, ""Just in Time""', 'Peter Hylenski, ""Maybe Happy Ending""', 'Dan Moses Schreier, ""Floyd Collins""', 'BC: Ending on a wonderful note, it\'s nice to know that Ilana agrees that ""Buena Vista Social Club"" should win.', 'IK: Siiiiigh. But yes.', 'BC: By the way, Ilana, did you know that special Tony Awards will be presented to the musicians who make up the band of ""Buena Vista Social Club""? And another special Tony will be given for the Illusions & Technical Effects of ""Stranger Things: The First Shadow.""', 'IK: And did you know, Bill, that the 2025 Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theatre will be presented to ""Great Performances""; Michael Price; New 42; and The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts? And that Gary Edwin Robinson, head of the theater arts program at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn was chosen as the 2025 winner of the Excellence in Theatre Education Award?

"2025 Tony Awards: Predicting the Likely Winners, from ‘Maybe Happy Ending’ to ‘Purpose’",https://www.slantmagazine.com/awards/tony-awards-2025-winner-predictions/,"['This season’s biggest surprise and delight is poised to make a clean sweep.', 'Sutton Foster, Bernadette Peters, Lea Salonga, Idina Menzel, and (if I may invoke her name) Patti LuPone would have been a monster of an all-star Tony nomination lineup in any other season. But those past winners, each a major force in musical theater history, missed the ballot despite their (almost uniformly) strong showings on Broadway this year.', 'If it’s uncouth to define a season by who didn’t make the Tony cut, that group of also-rans is a sign of the riches on offer. And if this season was in part distinguished by the arrival of a cavalcade of Hollywood A-listers, the nominations also highlight how many Broadway mainstays have set up residence to deliver excellence year after year: Nominees Jonathan Groff, Danya Taymor, Kara Young, Justin Peck, and Dede Ayite all won Tonys last season.', 'So if not quite every gem of the season is in the mix this Sunday (for one, the glorious Once Upon a Mattress didn’t receive a single nomination), the Tonys will still offer a chance to celebrate a jam-packed year. “The ending’s not the most important part,” sings HelperBot Oliver in Maybe Happy Ending, this season’s biggest surprise and delight and the show best poised to make a clean sweep. “But as endings go, ours is not so bad.”', 'George Clooney, Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola, Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill, Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim, Yellow Face\nHarry Lennix, Purpose\nLouis McCartney, Stranger Things: The First Shadow', 'Nominators did some of the preliminary work here, clearing out most of a cadre of celebrities: Robert Downey Jr., Denzel Washington, and Jake Gyllenhaal were left off the list. So it’s apparently a showdown between George Clooney and Cole Escola. But it’s not really much of a race since the impishly irreverent Escola has become the darling of Broadway this season, for their off-stage madcap interviews as much as for their on-stage shenanigans. Escola will win, but it’ll be the third case in two years of the Tonys forcing non-binary eventual winners to choose a binary gender in order to be considered.', 'Laura Donnelly, The Hills of California\nMia Farrow, The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson, Purpose\nSadie Sink, John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'It’s hard not to admire the audacious Sarah Snook for playing nearly 30 characters (some pre-taped) in The Picture of Dorian Gray. She’s terrific, and she’ll win. But what Laura Donnelly accomplished last fall in The Hills of California, taking on a mere two roles but rendering herself—accent, posture, facial expressions—remarkably unrecognizable in the play’s second half, was next-level. Dorian Gray, though lots of fun, was never moving, but Donnelly ensured that The Hills of California was a harrowing, devastating ride.', 'Glenn Davis, Purpose\nGabriel Ebert, John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue, Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk, Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora, Oh, Mary!', 'This category will likely come down to Conrad Ricamora, matching Cole Escola’s brand of silly as a very queer Abraham Lincoln, and Francis Jue, reviving a tragicomic role, a version of the playwright’s father that he first played two decades ago off-Broadway. A win for either would be the second time (after BD Wong in 1988) that any Asian American performer has won a Tony for a non-musical play. Only three Asian American actors have ever won Tonys, period, and with Darren Criss and Nicole Scherzinger in contention, there’s a good chance that number will double in a single ceremony. This category will be close, but it will be the veteran Jue by a hair.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play\nTala Ashe, English\nJessica Hecht, Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat, English\nFina Strazza, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young, Purpose', 'This is a stunner of a category and a particularly tricky one to predict, as all five women give nuanced performances and will each find strong support. I’d cast my vote for Marjan Neshat, the glorious actress finally making her Broadway debut as an Iranian teacher prepping her students for the TOEFL (English language) exam while trapped between two worlds. Both Neshat and Jessica Hecht are central characters in their ensemble plays, bordering on lead roles, and voters may be eager to award Hecht for her third nomination. But the irrepressible Kara Young is on a tear: This is her fourth nomination in this category in four seasons (she won last year for Purlie Victorious), and she’s as hilarious and moving as ever in Purpose. Look for voters to stay forever Young and make the four-time nominee a two-time winner.', 'Darren Criss, Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand, Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis, Sunset Boulevard\nJonathan Groff, Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart, A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical\nJeremy Jordan, Floyd Collins', 'Another massively competitive category that could conceivably go in five directions (it’s hard to imagine a win for James Monroe Iglehart, a surprise nominee, in the long-closed A Wonderful World). Jonathan Groff is wildly appealing as Bobby Darin in Just in Time, and Jeremy Jordan is at his career best as the ever-yodeling Floyd Collins. But Darren Criss will likely ride the wave of goodwill for Maybe Happy Ending to a win here. He’s also a producer on the little show, and seems to be fighting hard for its survival across the board.', 'Megan Hilty, Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald, Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers, Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger, Sunset Boulevard\nJennifer Simard, Death Becomes Her', 'For most of the season, it’s been Audra McDonald versus Nicole Scherzinger. But could this be a three-way race? Jasmine Amy Rogers vanquished both of those rivals in an all-gender category to win the Outer Critics Circle Award last month, and she and McDonald both won in a larger category at the Drama Desk Awards. Tony voters love an unexpected ingénue (just look at Maleah Joi Moon last season), and while McDonald and Scherzinger have their detractors, I haven’t heard a single negative comment about Rogers’s joyfully empowered take on Betty Boop. But one of these women is giving the best performance I have ever seen live in perhaps the greatest musical theater role ever written. When all’s said and done, we’ll keep the superlatives coming as McDonald extends her record as the most Tony-winning performer in history.', 'Brooks Ashmanskas, Smash\nJeb Brown, Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein, Gypsy\nJak Malone, Operation Mincemeat\nTaylor Trensch, Floyd Collins', 'It’s a delight to see Taylor Trensch snag his first nomination for his nearly non-singing performance as the compassionate journalist Skeets Miller in Floyd Collins. But the winner here will either be Danny Burstein, who’s astonishing in bringing warm-hearted, doomed optimism to Gypsy’s Herbie (his chemistry with co-star Audra McDonald is electric), or Jak Malone, cycling through likely dozens of roles in the peripatetic Operation Mincemeat. The latter also stands out for his tear-jerking rendition of “Dear Bill,” in which he plays a secretary reflecting on her lost husband. Burstein rose to the tip-top level of Gypsy’s material (and would get my vote), but Malone transcended the middling Operation Mincemeat.', 'Natalie Venetia Belcon, Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel, Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence, Just in Time\nJustina Machado, Real Women Have Curves\nJoy Woods, Gypsy', 'Joy Woods is heart-wrenching in a role that won Laura Benanti the Tony in 2008, and Julia Knitel delightfully plays a bevy of characters in Dead Outlaw, including a teenage girl sweetly confiding her secrets to a mummified corpse. But I think this category belongs to Natalie Venetia Belcon, the commandingly austere heart of Buena Vista Social Club. Her glare is withering, her poise is frightening, and her voice is astonishing. When her Omara Portuondo (a real-life, still-living Cuban singer) breaks out into a grin and a dance, it’s a bolt of joy.', 'Knud Adams, English\nSam Pinkleton, Oh, Mary!\nSam Mendes, The Hills of California\nDanya Taymor, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Last year, Danya Taymor’s win for The Outsiders over Maria Friedman (Merrily We Roll Along) was the ceremony’s big shocker. This year, don’t be surprised when she takes home her second Tony (tying her Aunt Julie!) for an equally assured production. Kip Williams and Sam Pinkleton may both be overshadowed by their star actors, Sarah Snook and Cole Escola, respectively, who’ve become synonymous with their shows. And though Knud Adams (my pick) and Sam Mendes provided the season’s most intimate, intricate stagings, those shows have both long closed. That leaves a deserving Taymor, who’s gotten her young ensemble cast all on the same page in telling a breathless, powerful story together.', 'Saheem Ali, Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden, Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer, Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd, Sunset Boulevard', 'This one’s a two-way race between the directors of the likely winners for best musical and best revival: Michael Arden and Jamie Lloyd. Sunset Boulevard draws attention to its director like few musicals in recent memory (merch from his production company even appears in the video projections during the show), but Lloyd’s high-concept re-envisioning has been divisive. Those who don’t like Sunset Boulevard will coalesce around the universally beloved Arden’s playful and video game-like staging. And since some Sunset Boulevard fans may also vote for Arden (nearly everyone likes Maybe Happy Ending), the robot invasion will sweep through this category. Don’t feel bad for Lloyd if it does, because he’ll be back next season with doubtless more dubious decisions with Waiting for Godot and maybe an Evita too.', 'Will Aronson and Hue Park, Maybe Happy Ending\nNoel Carey and Julia Mattison, Death Becomes Her\nDavid Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts, Operation Mincemeat\nJoy Huerta and Benjamin Velez, Real Women Have Curves\nDavid Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, Dead Outlaw', 'We don’t need a HelperBot to predict this one. Will Aronson and Hue Park’s utterly gorgeous, strings-drenched score is anything but robotic. In fact, it may well be the loveliest musical theater score since Adam Guettel’s The Light in the Piazza 20 years ago. Engrave it now.', 'Will Aronson and Hue Park, Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts, Operation Mincemeat\nItamar Moses, Dead Outlaw\nMarco Pennette, Death Becomes Her\nMarco Ramirez, Buena Vista Social Club', 'If someone’s going to steal a Tony from Maybe Happy Ending’s creative team, it’s here. The question is, who? Dead Outlaw has a totally surprising and brilliantly original structure and style. Death Becomes Her lands zinger after zinger with deadly precision. And Operation Mincemeat has won over many with its Monty Python-esque farcical approach to military history. But that many potential upstarts will split the vote in too many directions. Maybe Happy Ending’s wry heartbreaker of a script and story will still pull this one out.', 'Will Aronson, Maybe Happy Ending\nBruce Coughlin, Floyd Collins\nDavid Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sunset Boulevard\nMarco Paguia, Buena Vista Social Club\nAndrew Resnick and Michael Thurber, Just in Time', 'The orchestrations for Floyd Collins and Sunset Boulevard sound fantastic, but they’re actually beefed-up versions of the instrumentation from the ’90s. And the Buena Vista Social Club band already have received a special Tony this year (those musicians’ extraordinary improvisations surely have as much impact on the score as what’s in Paguia’s charts). That leaves Maybe Happy Ending and Just in Time. (Michael Thurber’s own rousing score for Goddess can now be heard at the Public and might well contend if that show transfers next season.) It’s the rare musical theater composer who independently orchestrates their own music, and Will Aronson’s instrumentation, especially his lush and playful strings writing, is as essential to the storytelling as the melody and lyrics. Give the guy three Tonys, because he’s earned it.', 'Joshua Bergasse, Smash\nCamille A. Brown, Gypsy\nPatricia Delgado and Justin Peck, Buena Vista Social Club\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJerry Mitchell, Boop! The Musical', 'Boop!: The Musical, Death Becomes Her, and Buena Vista Social Club are at three corners of a diverse dance triangle: an ebullient old-school tap-and jazz landscape versus a serpentine, vogue-infused palate versus a tribute to Cuban rhythms and movement. All three would be worthy winners, but I’ll give the edge to Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck. Buena Vista Social Club is a musical about the power of music and the show’s choreography renders dance an inextricable part of how that music hits home.', 'Eureka Day\nOur Town\nRomeo + Juliet\nYellow Face', 'The two most talked-about revivals this season—Othello and Glengarry Glen Ross—didn’t make the cut. That leaves us with four productions that have closed. I think I’d cast my vote for Kenny Leon’s imperfect but intermittently moving production of Our Town, but this race is between Eureka Day and Yellow Face. The latter is impressively subtle in its satire, but Eureka Day pulled out all the comedic stops in a crowd-pleasing scene with projections of an explosively emoji-ridden livestream chat. Voters will give one last thumbs up to Eureka Day.', 'English\nThe Hills of California\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain\nOh, Mary!\nPurpose', 'What a category. These five plays couldn’t be more different from each other, each exemplifying the genres in which the playwrights work. For much of the season, I assumed Oh, Mary!, a financial juggernaut and word-of-mouth sensation, would be undefeatable without a single play for voters who felt weird about voting for a light entertainment to coalesce around. Now I think we have one: John Proctor Is the Villain is just as fun as Oh, Mary!, until it isn’t, and playwright Kimberly Belflower’s wise mix of adolescent amusing awkwardness and fiercely empowering camaraderie make this show both blaringly funny and blazingly important. I’m still holding out hope that English, the beloved Pulitzer Prize winner that is a master class in storytelling as lithe and gentle as its French piano underscoring, can sneak out a victory. (I wonder whether The Hills of California and Purpose may be hampered by being slightly less successful successors to their playwrights’ more popular Broadway outings.) But as Shaina Taub’s suffragists sang last season, “The young are at the gates.” If so, a win for John Proctor Is the Villain will prove it.', 'Floyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Boulevard', 'I was unconvinced by the entirety of the Sunset Boulevard project, and I just don’t buy that Jamie Lloyd and his collaborators actually respect the show itself. Gypsy, on the other hand, is about as loving a revival as you could hope for, with Audra McDonald offering a blisteringly definitive Mama Rose and director George C. Wolfe poignantly reimagining how this historical musical can make crystalline sense through a newly Black lens. But Sunset Boulevard, in its brashness (and in its holding up traffic for the live video feed of the title song eight times a week), has demanded attention in a way that will likely pay off come Sunday.', 'Buena Vista Social Club\nDeath Becomes Her\nDead Outlaw\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat', 'Maybe Happy Ending nearly didn’t have the finances together to start performances in the fall. In the early weeks, grosses were perilously low. The show’s days seemed numbered. As a theater critic, I’ve never been prouder of the way the critic community came together in harmony on November 12 to sing this little show’s praises. The critical acclaim, warm word of mouth, and successful social media strategy reversed the show’s fortunes by Christmas. Dead Outlaw is a wild, unpredictable ride with a delightful ensemble cast, and it could easily take home the prize in another year (it won all the precursor awards in its off-Broadway run last season). And Death Becomes Her delivers the kind of sparkling, snappy comedy on a grand scale that audiences rightly lap up. But Maybe Happy Ending, in its marriage of wit and pathos, and of Korean and American storytelling influences, is a cut above. It’s an utterly magical work of theater, and it’ll be an undoubtedly happy ending for the Maybe Happy Ending team on Tony night.', 'Dan Rubins is a writer, composer, and arts nonprofit leader.

The other five are Tony-nom first-timers: Scherzinger, 46, formerly of the Pussycat Dolls; Criss, 38, Glee star and Emmy winner for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story; and Snook, 37, who shot to fame on Succession, for which she won an Emmy last year. Escola, 38, who uses they/them pronouns, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and McCartney, 21, making his professional stage debut, are the season’s breakouts.', 'The group was diverse in more ways than one.

To quote Wicked, because I’m a theater geek, “Magic is a demanderating mistress,” and it does not let up. I’d also like to shout out a movement professor I had at the University of Michigan, Malcolm Tulip. He helped to unlock my interest in physical theater. It was just a niche interest for me that I never thought would come up in any other realm in my life. Cut to 20 years later, I find myself in a situation where I call upon the skillsets that he introduced to me.', 'LOUIS MCCARTNEY One of our directors, Justin Martin.

I didn’t know what I was doing and I was very frightened about working with her, because she was such grand lady and one of the greatest actresses of the theater. But she ended up becoming such a mentor that I named one of my daughters after her. I learned from Zoe by watching how disciplined she was about the preparation for each performance, about knowing everybody’s name at the theater, making sure that she was thanking everybody on a nightly basis. I have adopted a lot of her methods, one of which is making sure that I’m at the theater a good three hours before showtime.

Come here!” And he dragged me into the garage and told me his idea that I should play Rose in Gypsy.', 'SCHERZINGER Wow, that’s an amazing story!', 'MCDONALD So it’s a tribute to Gavin.

Your association with this project goes back to 2018?', 'GROFF Eight years ago, [producer] Ted Chapin asked me to do a night of Bobby Darin music at the 92nd Street Y. Sort of like you, Cole, part of my inspiration is watching clips of divas singing, so I went home and watched Bobby Darin performing on YouTube, and I had this reaction that I normally feel when I watch Barbra [Streisand] or Judy [Garland] or Beyoncé — it’s usually reserved for a female performer, but he was singing for his life. Then I started learning about him, that he was told that he was going to die by the time he was 16, so from 16 to 37 was all borrowed time for him, and is reflected in the primal way that he’s leaping, in these black and white clips, off of my computer screen. I read this quote that, “At the end of the day, he was a nightclub animal,” which is now a line at the end of our show. So at the Y, we started doing his music live, which was really fun, but then all of a sudden, in the space between audience and performer, it felt spiritual. For the last seven and a half years, we’ve been trying to make it happen [on Broadway]. And now we’re at Circle in the Square, finally getting to do it for an audience, and it’s like drugs. It’s great.', '', 'Nicole, the world first got to know you through the Pussycat Dolls — you ladies were together from 2003 through 2010 — but from what I understand, your interest in and involvement with theater predated that, and you’ve been on a quest to get back to it. In fact, I was invited to something at the Pendry Hotel in LA in 2022, and I wasn’t sure what was behind it, but I was thrilled to get to see you—', 'SCHERZINGER You went?!', 'Yes. This was an intimate performance that you gave, which sort of connects to Sunset Blvd., right?', 'SCHERZINGER I got my first job when I was about 14 at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky — which, for Louisville, Kentucky, is big time, y’all — and I was in a youth performing arts high school. That’s where I found my tribe. I always felt, since I was a little girl, that I didn’t really fit in and didn’t really feel comfortable in my skin, but then I went to this performing arts school and I was like, “Oh my gosh, these humans are just like me!” I started out in voice and learned to read music and sang in the choir; and then I went to musical theater. Ms. Mateus cast me in Alice when I was 15—', 'ESCOLA Alice in Wonderland?', 'SCHERZINGER Alice in Wonderland.', 'ESCOLA Okay. It could have been Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. [laughs]', '', 'SCHERZINGER And that was big-time for me because back then people didn’t cast roles like that. I was like, “Yo, you’re casting a Hawaiian-Ukrainian-Filipina girl as Alice?!” So, that’s where my love affair began with musical theater. I went on to college and to do a lot more musical theater — summer stock in many different places around the country — so yes, this is over 30 years in the making. In the Dolls we have a song called “When I Grow Up [I Want to Be Famous],” and we were shooting that music video on Hollywood Blvd. in front of the Pantages, and there’s actually a video where I go, “I always thought I’d end up on that side of the street,” and it pans to the Pantages with Wicked. I was fortunate enough to do Rent at the Hollywood Bowl 10 years ago. Neil Patrick Harris directed it and it had a beautiful cast—', 'CRISS I saw that! It was fantastic. You smoked that.', 'SCHERZINGER Around 2017 or 2018, I was like, “Can I please audition for things?” And people wouldn’t even allow me to audition. So I created my own show and put it on in London, New York at the Django, and then in LA [at the Pendry]. I was like, “I’m just going to go put it on myself and invite people to come.” It was all the roles that I wanted to be cast in and all the songs that I wanted to sing. And that’s what you saw.', 'You obviously achieved your objective, because Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jamie Lloyd approached you about Sunset Blvd. — and I know you sort of thought at the time, “Is it a great compliment or insult to be asked to play Norma Desmond?” But I think the ultimate compliment came after Andrew Lloyd Webber later said that your performance is the best thing that he’s ever seen in anything that he’s been a part of, which is high praise.', 'ESCOLA He didn’t see me in Cats. [laughs]', 'Darren, Maybe Happy Ending is an original musical. How did it get on your radar and how did you wind up bringing it to Broadway?', '', 'CRISS I think all the best stories that we weren’t really prepared to hear — Batman or Star Wars are examples. If you were trying to elevator-pitch any of them, people would be like, “What the fuck are you talking about? That’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.” So it is fun to be part of something so singular. I was telling Audra that I name-drop her every night when people come by to say hello. I say, “I don’t envy the Herculean task that Audra has. First, it’s over three hours of ripping your soul out vocally, emotionally, all these things. But because it’s such a known piece, people also come in with comparisons and expectations, which isn’t fair to her—', 'MCDONALD And singing along! [laughs]', 'CRISS Because I’ve done shows like Little Shop [of Horrors, Off Broadway] and Hedwig [and the Angry Inch, on Broadway] where people know the material, that can also be an obstacle and something that you have to overcome, for better or for worse. For me, I’ve never been a part of anything where audience has been completely unencumbered by expectation or experience. That in itself is an obstacle, because now I have to try and convince them that this is something somewhat worthwhile, but it is amazing to feel that the gasp of, “What is going on?!” But in short, this came to me in 2018, and it was just a matter of being available — the pandemic and then a strike and so many things that happened until finally the stars aligned in a way that I’m so grateful for.', 'Sarah, The Picture of Dorian Gray was never done for the stage until 2020, when it was first performed in Australia. How did you wind up attached to it?', '', 'SNOOK Kip [Williams, the playwright] and I had a conversation about it around March of 2023. I was about to go and shoot the final scenes in Barbados for season four of Succession. I went, “This is an amazing thing that’s about to end, and this is something else that I could go on to.” The question, first of all, was, “What’s the earliest you think you could do this? We have a theater we’re looking at in August.” [laughs] I was like, “I have a baby I’m currently cooking. She’s due in April. So there’s no way I can make August work. The earliest I could do it is this time next year.” And so they accommodated that.', 'You’re used to having to perform a lot of lines very quickly, between Sorkin’s with Steve Jobs and Succession, among other things, but doing so while also literally running from one character into another, as you do in Dorian Gray, is different.', 'SNOOK It’s different. And it’s prose that has been turned into dialogue and that has to be spoken in a way that the audience can receive it, to understand it, to be engaged with it — finding places to be incredibly swift with it, because we need to be moving on and get the audience leaning forward, and then also to allow them to sort of sit back for a second and enjoy the pretty pictures. And I think, ironically, that having a baby and doing this show was maybe a good choice because it means that you stay very straight and narrow. You’re not going out after the show to have a drink or wind down. It’s like, “No, I’ve got to go breastfeed in two hours, so I’m going to try to get another hour-and-a-half of sleep now, wake up and feed, and then go back to sleep.”', 'Louis, you’re only 21. What was going on in your life when you first heard about Stranger Things: The First Shadow? Were you already a watcher of Stranger Things?', '', 'MCCARTNEY I was just moving out of Dublin. My dad and I were doing our little YouTube channel, which is how they [the show’s producers] got wind of me, and how my agent got wind of me me as well. I was finishing up season three of Hope Street, which was the soap I did. And then I got wind of this “untitled Netflix play directed by Stephen Daldry,” and I did three to four months of auditions, and was flying back to Belfast, and finally we got word that it was Henry Creel, so all my focus then turned on Jamie Campbell Bower [who played the character on the TV show] and his performance in season four. I think he’s phenomenal — I wanted to emulate that, but also create my own line of Henry Creel because he’s a kid in the show, and we’re dealing with this idea, “What if he’s a good boy? What if he just wants to go to school and get a girlfriend?” At the start of the process, I judged him and thought that he was a bad kid, but now I think he’s a really good kid and it’s his conditioning and the people around him that shaped him. But that’s the question of our play. It’s quite a psychological Greek take on Stranger Things. You’ve got the mother archetype and you have the tragic hero, very Hamlet, and there’s lots of questions to the stars, “Why me and why am I like this?” But also keeping with the mythology of Stranger Things and honoring the fans.', 'It has now been 10 years since the opening on Broadway of a little show called Hamilton, which Mr. Groff here helped to bring to life. Jonathan, 10 years later, what do you believe is the greatest legacy of Hamilton?', '', 'GROFF That Lin-Manuel Miranda is a fucking genius and wrote an unparalleled work of art. I replaced Brian d’Arcy James in the show Off Broadway at the Public Theater. He originated the role of the King, so I got this really interesting experience with the show because I always felt outside of it and inside of it at the same time. Lin and I became friends when I was doing Spring Awakening and he was doing In The Heights, and we had stayed in touch, and then Brian had to leave and Lin texted me, “What are you doing next month? Can you come be in the show that I wrote for a couple months Off Broadway?” I was like, “Sure.” I went on a Friday and was in the show on Tuesday. When I saw it, I was like, “Oh my God!” I mean, we all had that experience seeing it. The King is only on stage for nine minutes; when we moved to Broadway to the Richard Rodgers, I would peek through the curtain, watching the show. Lin is such a brilliant performer, he has such an awareness of storytelling and audience, and he knew how to keep everyone’s attention for two-and-a-half, three hours. Even when I’m listening to the mashup that we’re doing on the Tonys I’m like, “Oh my God, Hamilton is so good!” Now it’s been around for a decade and you’re like, “Oh, yeah, it’s Hamilton” — it’s the poster and it’s “send all your friends to see it” and whatever. But every time I re-engage with the material, it’s just pure genius.', 'Audra, yours is the sixth Broadway incarnation of Gypsy, and you are the first person of color to play Rose. You’ve been navigating this conversation your whole life, or at least since you were 16 and playing Eva Perón in Evita. Also, you received your first Tony nomination for Carousel, for a part that had been played by white people. Can you take us into your experience with nontraditional casting?', 'MCDONALD I was very lucky growing up in Fresno, California, and having two parents who needed something for their very hyperactive, over-emotional, over-dramatic child who was struggling deeply. They found this dinner theater for me, and I went and auditioned and became a part of the little junior troupe. And once I was a part of that troupe, like when all of us kind of find theater, it was, “Oh, here I am!”', 'ESCOLA “Bye, everyone!”', '', 'MCDONALD “I know who I am now.” Or, “I know that there are a lot of people like me,” whether we know who we are or not. But in that theater in Fresno, I at one point was cast to play the Servant Girl in The Miracle Worker — I just ran out and auditioned for it and got the part — and my parents said, “Absolutely not. You will not be playing that part. We don’t need to have you out there perpetuating stereotypes. There are other roles for you.” From then on, it was, “What role do you think you can play? And make them say no to you.” So when the call came to audition for Carousel, I think that helped me. I’m trying to find who a person is, not what they look like; that’s a part of it, but, “Who are they? And is there something in my soul that can help illuminate who that character is?” And that’s what I feel about what’s happened with Rose. The main thing with me playing Rose as a Black woman is we are not shrinking away from it. We have not changed a single line. We have not changed any of the grammar. A lot of people come to this show and say, “Oh, well Rose is saying “that ain’t this” and “that ain’t that” — I’m like, “That’s what Arthur Laurents wrote!” I felt I just knew who she was, and why couldn’t it be a Black woman’s story? Why couldn’t it be an Asian woman’s story? It could be anybody’s story!', 'Cole, you’re a bit of a trailblazer yourself. Over the last few years, there have been a couple of non-binary performers who have been recognized, but not many. Some award shows have adopted gender-neutral awards. That is not the case obviously at the Tonys, so you had to weigh in on which of the existing categories you wanted to be eligible for, and selected best actor in a play. But how did you feel about having to make that call? And is that something that you hope changes?', 'ESCOLA I do hope it changes, yeah. I didn’t love having to make that choice. There are arguments, “Well, women are given so little, and that would take more away from them,” but at the Drama Desks last year, best performer went to Sarah Paulson and Jessica Lange; no men won, and I think the same thing happened in the supporting category. So I don’t know, it’s such a weird thing, it’s almost arbitrary — “Well, a man couldn’t play this same role that a woman can play.” Well, an eighty-year-old couldn’t play Juliet — well, I shouldn’t say that. An eighty-year-old could play Juliet. But where the lines are drawn, I guess, doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Best director is gender-neutral.', 'Every other category is.', 'ESCOLA Every other category.', 'MCDONALD It makes for a shorter night. [laughs]', '', 'ESCOLA It makes for a shorter night. I don’t know. I just want to do my show and be myself, and I don’t want to push people’s buttons — well, that’s not true. [laughs] I do want to push people’s buttons, but not those buttons.', 'Another topic of conversation in the community is the role that technology is playing. Sarah and Nicole have camera rigs on stage with large screens that give us a look into things that people never would’ve been able to see on Broadway until a few years ago. Louis, some of the effects in your show are unbelievable, and probably wouldn’t have been possible pre-Harry Potter and The Cursed Child, the effects of which were handled by some of the same people who worked on your show and are getting a special Tony for them. In the case of the three of your shows, the technology helps to connect the stories to the world of today, especially for younger audiences, wouldn’t you say?', 'SNOOK Yeah, absolutely. Technology is always going to advance — we invent things and we find ways to incorporate them into our lives. And we’ve always had theater — it’s an ancient art form. So inevitably you’re going to incorporate technological advancements into theater in some ways. And as long as it has a dramaturgical purpose and an active influence on the audience, I think there’s a place for it. This show wouldn’t be possible without the camerawork that the camerapeople do, and also the video they record, edits that we’ve created beforehand. And it’s amazing to work inside of that.', 'Nicole, how did you acclimate to acting while there are people with cameras running around you?', '', 'SCHERZINGER I guess I’m kind of used to cameras with singing, but I didn’t have a choice. It makes sense, obviously, because Norma is a film star, that he incorporated that. And we don’t have a set or props or anything, so we’re able to tell that story on stage and then to be a little bit more intimate when the camera is involved. But yeah, as pop star, this [points to the left side of her face] is my good side. I’m sitting on my bad side [points to the right side of her face] today. [laughs] So I’ve had to throw all that down the drain. He [director Jamie Lloyd] has taken me out of my comfort zone, but it’s what’s got me here today. It’s supposed to emanate from within, anyway.', 'We’ve established that unbelievable physicality is demanded of each of you in these roles. Audra, you’ve said that you’ve never played a more exhausting part. Darren, I don’t know how you don’t need a chiropractor walking around with you all day.', 'SCHERZINGER I have several good ones.', 'CRISS I’ve got to ask Nicole.', 'What do you do for yourself physically between performances?', 'CRISS I’m really militant about contrast therapy. It’s this ancient Norwegian stuff. It’s being in a hot bath and a cold plunge. I’ll do a sauna and a steam. I do this two, three times a week for about a half hour.', 'MCDONALD Do you have a sauna in your dressing room?!', 'SCHERZINGER And a cold plunge?!', 'CRISS I do not. I wish I did. I’ll go to a place that has a sauna. I’ll do a steam room for 15 minutes, a cold plunge for three minutes, and a sauna for 15. I’ll do it in-between shows. It’s a meditative thing. It’s good for my respiratory system, circulatory system and immune system, and that is how I keep my battery charged. It’s a reset. It’s my time to just relax. I feel I’m on a beach. I close my eyes and just drown out the world.', 'MCDONALD I would never come for the second show. [laughs]', 'CRISS Well, it’s that cold plunge at the very end, sitting in 45-degree water for three minutes. After that I’m like, “All right, let’s go, we’ve got another one!”', 'SNOOK I just sleep. I think it’s so important. I mean, for me, I need eight hours.', '', 'ESCOLA Between shows? [laughs]', 'SNOOK You’ve got to have the deep-sleep recovery because it heals your body.', 'SCHERZINGER That’s how I feel too. I have to tell myself, “It’s a new day, it’s a new performance.”', 'ESCOLA It’s reminding me of that Ethel Merman quote: “Warm up? That’s what the opening number’s for!” [laughs] I can’t rest between shows because then I wouldn’t get up.', 'MCDONALD I can’t either. Other shows I’ve been able to, but I can’t sleep in between this one. Our show is basically three hours, so especially on a Wednesday matinee, we’ve got a 2pm and a 7:30pm, so I only have enough time to do PT and then sit down for a few minutes and stare at a wall.', 'ESCOLA Yeah, exactly. The wall stare.', 'You all move back and forth between screen and stage work. When you go from one to the other, what is the thing that you most consciously have to remind yourself to do differently?', 'ESCOLA I don’t [do things differently], and that’s why I always get told on [a film or TV] set, “Just less.” [laughs]', 'MCDONALD “Think louder.” I used to be so afraid of the camera. Once I figured out that the camera is the audience, I realized that I could think louder and the camera will pick it up.', 'ESCOLA Oh, I’ve got to write that down.', 'SCHERZINGER I’m taking that.', 'Speaking of moving back and forth between the stage and screen, some people will discover you through one and not even know that you do the other. Darren, you told me a funny story about this earlier today.', '', 'CRISS There’s no prerequisite for you to know anything about a person’s career. I’ll never forget, I saw this queen [McDonald] a long time ago at one of her shows in Los Angeles, and there was a woman next to me who loved Private Practice [the ABC TV series on which McDonald appeared from 2007 through 2011]. We were just small-talking before you went on, and I mentioned Ragtime and all these shows that I’ve loved your performances in. And she says, “I didn’t know she was a singer.” And I’m like, “You best buckle up, you’re about to get served some serious fucking shit!” [laughs] I just was so moved by that because, again, there’s no prerequisite here. Her gateway drug was Private Practice. We take all kinds. We’re happy to have you!', 'MCDONALD No, it’s true. People who don’t usually come to see theater, but come for some reason — “Well, I love Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls, so I’m coming to see her” or “I love Sarah from Succession” or whatever — what usually happens is they get bit by the theater bug. They get a taste, and then they want more.', 'Let’s close with some fun rapid-fire stuff. Excluding relatives, who’s the person whose attendance at one of your performances of your current show has meant the most to you?', 'ESCOLA Elaine May.', 'GROFF Tom Hanks.', 'MCCARTNEY Tom Hanks as well.', 'SNOOK Bette Midler.', 'CRISS Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber.', 'SCHERZINGER Glenn Close or Oprah.', 'What’s the most unusual thing in your dressing room?', 'ESCOLA Me. [laughs]', 'MCCARTNEY Dried lavender that I have yet to buy a vase for.', 'SNOOK I’ve got a little crochet doll of the characters of Dorian and Jane from Predestination [a 2014 film in which she starred] and my Met Gala outfit, which this incredibly talented young woman crocheted. I love them, and so does my daughter — she loves to play with them.', 'What’s the most annoying thing that audience members are doing at Broadway shows in 2025?', 'SNOOK I don’t get particularly annoyed by it because I know the impulse, but I do just want to make a PSA that we can see your phones when they’re up. It’s a reflective surface reflecting back onto the stage. I can see you filming. [laughs]', '', 'MCDONALD We can’t do anything about phones. It is what it is. But at curtain call, it’s almost like no one’s applauding anymore because they’re all filming! It’s the weirdest thing to me. “Well, then we’ll just go.”', 'SCHERZINGER Because they’re trying to catch that legacy, honey! They got to get it. [laughs] Also, we can hear you eating. Sometimes with the rustling, I’m like, “Did you get it? Did you?”', 'Last one. If you could snap your fingers and make it so, what would be the ideal number of performances you would perform per week?', 'SCHERZINGER That is a great question.', 'MCDONALD That is a really good question.', 'CRISS Do you get to decide when they are?', 'Absolutely.', 'MCDONALD Wednesday matinée is gone.', 'SNOOK Yeah, I think seven is good.', 'MCCARTNEY We do a double-double — two on Saturday and two on Sunday — so we don’t have a Wednesday matinée.', 'SNOOK The Sunday matinée is not something that exists in London, but it’s fantastic.', 'SCHERZINGER Delightful.', 'SNOOK Because then you get a spare night!', 'SCHERZINGER Six would be lush.

Shows set in the U.S., the U.K., Cuba, Italy, and Iran all make their way to the nominees circle. Not to mention a show from South Korea projected to win more Tonys than any other production, potentially the first one ever to premiere in Asia and win best musical.', 'And when I say “projected,” I mean that mathematically. Every year, I run a statistical model based on precursor awards, which categories a show is nominated in, blended critic predictions, and betting markets to project the odds that each nominee will emerge victorious in every category. After another wonderful year on Broadway, with 42 new shows opening and 29 of them receiving nominations, it’s time to get excited for the big night with a data-based forecast at who might triumph at Radio City Music Hall on June 8 on CBS (and Paramount+).', '', 'Maybe Happy Ending is both the name of the show and a surprisingly apt description for how its night at the Tonys will conclude. Emphasis on “maybe”: the model is higher on Dead Outlaw than one might suspect, since it takes into account that show’s multiple honors for its off-Broadway run a year ago.', 'Best play is much closer than best musical, with three productions above a 1-in-5 chance to win. The Drama League has a remarkable streak in this category, predicting every Tony winner since Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike (2013), so that’s enough to put this year’s Drama League pick of Oh, Mary! over the top.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won best musical in 1995, but that was an odd year: only two original musicals opened that season (the other being Smokey Joe’s Café), so the competition wasn’t as stiff as usual. The Sunset Boulevard revival will have a tougher path to the podium with three opponents to beat, Gypsy in particular.', 'Yellow Face is an extremely popular pick here, and could very well win. For one thing, it earned an Outer Critics Circle nod that Eureka Day missed. But when the two went head-to-head at the Drama Desk and Drama League Awards, Eureka Day went 2-for-2.', 'Nine actors have won lead actor in a musical twice, and no one has won more than twice. Not only could Jonathan Groff (Just in Time) become the tenth man on that list, but he could become the first ever to do it in consecutive years after his Merrily We Roll Along win a year ago. The model has him at 19.2 percent, a not-insurmountable 20 percentage points the leader, Darren Criss (Maybe Happy Ending).', '', 'At some point I’ll run out of trivia facts to post about Audra McDonald. She’s already set the all-time record for the most Tony acting wins, with six, and is favored to win her seventh for Gypsy. But Nicole Scherzinger (Sunset Boulevard) is a popular pick as well in what’s shaping up to be both a great race in its own right and a precursor of the musical revival category.', 'Cole Escola is performing double-duty, as both the writer and star of Oh, Mary! and is the clear favorite according to the mathematical model, with Jon Michael Hill in Purpose at a distant runner up.', 'Sarah Snook stars as Dorian Gray – and every other role – and has a 42.8 percent chance to win the Tony for the one-woman show. But close behind her is Laura Donnelly (The Hills of California) at 33.2 percent.', 'Jak Malone (Operation Mincemeat) stands out as not only the favorite in this category, but as the most likely winner across all eight acting categories. Operation Mincemeat is up for four Tonys, but it’s projected to lose each of the other three to Maybe Happy Ending (not nominated in this race), making this category its best chance at a victory.', 'There’s probably a good debate to be had on whether Natalie Venetia Belcon (Buena Vista Social Club) belonged in the leading or featured category. But regardless of which category she slots into, no one is debating that this was a Tony-worthy performance as Cuban singer Omara Portuondo.', 'That tension you’re feeling is the symptom of just a 3.8 percentage-point gap between Conrad Ricamora (Oh, Mary!) and Francis Jue (Yellow Face). Oh, Mary! appears to be the more beloved production overall – projected to win five categories – so that might be enough to tip the scales in Ricamora’s favor.', 'Only Judith Light (Other Desert Cities, The Assembled Parties) has won featured actress in a play twice in a row. Kara Young, fresh off her win for Purlie Victorious, could be the second, but she’ll have to get past Jessica Hecht (Eureka Day) first.', ' It feels like this happens in so many years: The directors of the best musical and best musical revival frontrunners going head-to-head as the top two candidates in this category. Michael Arden (Maybe Happy Ending) holds a narrow 5.6 percentage-point lead over Jamie Lloyd (Sunset Boulevard).', 'Danya Taymor (John Proctor Is the Villain) could join Trevor Nunn, Jerry Zaks, Joe Mantello, and Jack O’Brien as the only people to win best direction of a musical and best direction of a play in consecutive years. But to accomplish that, she’ll need to take down the slight frontrunner, Sam Pinkleton (Oh, Mary!).', 'Boy does Death Becomes Her need a win for Paul Tazewell here. Otherwise, with no other categories it’s currently favored in, it risks becoming just the ninth show in Tony history to walk away with zero wins on ten or more nominations.', '', 'Holly Pierson (Oh, Mary!) does an excellent job threading the needle – apologies for the pun – between faithfully recreating 19th century styles and mirroring the inherent silliness of the show’s concept. None of these shows won a Drama Desk or an Outer Critics Circle honor for their costumes, so it’s a less informed prediction than most.', 'The original run of Sunset Boulevard won seven Tonys, but this is the only category it won that its successor is also favored to win. The first time around, it was Andrew Bridge winning his second Tony, after a first for The Phantom of the Opera. This time, it’s lighting designer Jack Knowles looking to win his first.', 'This is the first of three consecutive play design categories that Stranger Things: The First Shadow holds the highest percentage on. And that’s actually underselling how honored this production might be, since it’s also due to receive a Special Tony Award for its illusions and technical effects.', 'In a category that typically nominates solo artists, Dane Laffrey and George Reeve (Maybe Happy Ending) are teaming up. Franne and Eugene Lee (Candide in 1974) are currently the only pair of individuals to share this award for a single musical.', 'The prior paragraph notwithstanding, 59 Productions breaks the dichotomy between individuals and duos. This design studio already has a win on the musical side from An American in Paris, and is now looking to notch its first victory for a play for Stranger Things: The First Shadow, in conjunction with four-time nominee Miriam Buether.', 'We now arrive at the single closest category of the year, according to my model. Just 0.8 percent separates Buena Vista Social Club and Sunset Boulevard for sound design of a musical. If you’re entering a Tony pool, you may as well flip a coin.', 'Paul Arditti’s nomination here for Stranger Things: The First Shadow marks the single most likely winner of any nominee in any category this year. Not sure if this is the category you expected to hear that stat in, but when the critics and the precursor awards are unanimous, that’s what happens.', 'In the order of this article, this marks the fifth projected win for Maybe Happy Ending. Should every prediction included here come true (a highly unlikely event), Maybe Happy Ending and Oh, Mary! would become the tenth pair of best musical/best play winners in the same season to each win 5+ Tonys. The most recent occurrence was The Band’s Visit and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.', 'It might feel like the same show always wins the trio of best musical, book, and score. But in recent years, that’s far from true: Kimberly Akimbo is the only show to pull off that trifecta since 2019. Maybe Happy Ending is now hoping to become the second in that timespan.', 'Jerry Mitchell has been widely praised for his choreography for Boop!, and could certainly conclude this awards season with a Tony. But, a key factor in the model is which other categories a show is nominated in, and only two other shows in the past 50 years (Swan Lake, Bandstand) managed to win this award without either a best musical or musical revival nomination.', '', 'I don’t know if the Tonys tipped their hand here or not, but Marco Paguia has technically already won a Tony for Buena Vista Social Club, as he and the rest of the band received a Special Tony Award this year. He’s got a 56.2 percent to add a competitive win to that trophy case.', '***', 'These blurbs alongside each chart cover but a small fraction of the talent from around the world involved in making this Broadway season happen.

Complete 2025 Tony Award Predictions,https://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/complete-2025-tony-award-predictions,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Here are the artists and shows that we think will win Tonys in all 26 categories for the 2024–25 season.', ""The unusually bountiful 2024–25 Broadway season has spoiled us for choice. Deciding how to vote for the Tony Awards will be harder than it has been in a long time: Even more than usual, this year's ballot requires Tony voters to make wrenching decisions among candidates who are manifestly deserving. That, in turn, makes it hard for Tony pundits to predict all the winners with confidence. Still, even so, nonetheless: We have studied the 2025 Tony nominations, kept an ear cocked for buzz and talked to a multitude of voters, and now we are ready to make our final calls. Remember: These are our predictions, not our choices, and we are fully prepared—in some cases, even hopeful!—for the possibility that we may be guessing wrong. Here’s who we think will win when Cynthia Erivo host Broadway’s biggest night on June 8, 2025."", 'RECOMMENDED: A full guide to the 2025 Tony Awards and in-depth interviews with select Tony nominees ', 'BEST MUSICAL', 'Buena Vista Social Club\nDead Outlaw\nDeath Becomes Her\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat', ""The race: The field of contenders for the Tony Awards' marquee prize was notably deep this year: 14 new musicals, most of them good. Several shows that might have been shoo-ins for nominations in other years, such as Real Women Have Curves, didn't end up making the cut. Of the five that did, three are intimately scaled—which is not necessarily a handicap in this category, which has trended in recent years toward smaller, artier musicals. Support this season appears to have consolidated behind the lovely and original android romance Maybe Happy Ending; while a happy ending for the production is not guaranteed, its odds put it closer to will be than maybe."", 'BEST PLAY', 'English by Sanaz Toossi\nThe Hills of California by Jez Butterworth\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain by Kimberly Belflower\nOh, Mary! by Cole Escola \nPurpose by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins', ""The race: Another embarassment of riches: Two of the nominees, Purpose and English, have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Of those two, the still-running Purpose has an edge. But the suprise hit of the year is Cole Escola's riotously funny Oh, Mary!, which has fancy credentials of its own—it was a runner-up to Purpose for the Pulitzer—and has generated huge buzz beyond the usual theater circles. Nothing like it has ever won Best Play, which tends to reward more serious fare; but on the other hand, the Best Play winner is strongly correlated to the winner of Best Director of a Play—they've gone together 17 out of 24 times in this century—and Purpose isn't nominated for the latter. (Only once in the 21st century has a new play whose director wasn't nominated beaten one whose director was; the winning play was 2002's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?, Edward Albee's first new Broadway work since 1975 to run for more than two weeks.) We predict that the sheer joy of Escola's show will carry the day."", 'BEST REVIVAL OF A MUSICAL', 'Floyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Blvd.  ', ""The race: Recent momentum for Audra McDonald (see below) has helped Gypsy's chances, but this parade is still scheduled for Sunset Blvd. Gypsy is the better musical, but Jamie Lloyd's production of Sunset is the bolder reinvention. And the absence of Gypsy director George C. Wolfe from this category is a powerful indicator, too, albeit with an asterisk: In the years since awards for revivals were introduced in 1977, only one musical revival whose eligible director wasn't nominated has ever beaten one whose director was—but that one winning revival was Gypsy! Then again, that was in 1990, and neither of the show's two revivals since then wound up taking the prize. Sunset has the upper hand."", 'BEST REVIVAL OF A PLAY', 'Eureka Day\nOur Town\nRomeo + Juliet\nYellow Face', ""The race: The neck-and-neck race between David Henry Hwang's Yellow Face and Jonathan Spector's Eureka Day makes this one nearly impossible to call. Eureka Day has the advantages of being both newer (it premiered in 2018, so it feels more like an original play than a revival) and more recent, having closed in February versus Yellow Face's November. But Yellow Face was recorded for PBS and broadcast in May, which evens that field somewhat. It's a true coin toss of a category, but we predict that Yellow Face will win the day—or even that the race will yield a rare Tony tie.  "", 'BEST BOOK OF A MUSICAL', 'Buena Vista Social Club by Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw by Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her by Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending by Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat by David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', ""The race: For musicals, though not for plays, the Tonys draw a distinction between the sum of a production's parts (Best Musical) and its writing, both nonmusical (Best Book) and musical (Best Score). Not infrequently, especially when the big winner is large production, one or both writing awards will go elsewhere, as they did last year to Shaina Taub's Suffs. This year, though, we suspect that voters won't see as much need for distinction. Will Aronson and Hue Park's storytelling in Maybe Happy Ending is the most charming and emotionally resonant of the nominees; and while Dead Outlaw and Operation Mincemeat adopt less conventional narrative strategies, they are both inspired by historical events, which helps the entirely original Maybe Happy Ending stand out."", 'BEST SCORE ', 'Dead Outlaw by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending by Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat by David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', ""The race: If Dead Outlaw picks up an award, it is most likely to be for David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna's smart and eclectic score, which not only suits the show perfectly but is also highly enjoyable as a cast recording. But the show—which tracks a corpse through decades of American history—is probably a skosh too weird for Tony voters. We think Maybe Happy Ending will add this award to its haul. "", 'BEST ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL ', ""Megan Hilty, Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald, Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers, Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger, Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard, Death Becomes Her\n\nThe race: This has been the race to watch all year: a gladiator match of champions. This season was so flush with Best Actress contenders that Sutton Foster and Idina Menzel didn't even get nominated; neither did Maybe Happy Ending's adorable Helen J Shen. Since the fall, the assumption has been that the race would come down to a diva showdown between Audra's Mama Rose and Scherzinger's Norma Desmond, with the latter at a slight advantage because a) everyone agrees that Audra is acting the hell out of her part but not everyone thinks her voice always works for the part, and b) she has six Tonys already. But then came Jasmine Amy Rogers in Boop!, delivering the kind of starmaking performance that voters love to reward. (That doesn't leave much room for the wonderful co-stars of Death Becomes Her, who in a different year would be leading the pack.) As recently as two weeks ago, we would have predicted a Scherzinger win, with Rogers as a dark horse. But the fallout from LuPonedemonium, which reminded people not to take Audra for granted, has shifted the balance; to a lesser extent, so has sympathy over Boop!'s exclusion from the Tonys. What that means is that the night's most exciting race is back to being anyone's guess—and our guess, since we have to make one, is that Audra will need to find a bit more room on her mantel. "", 'BEST ACTOR IN A MUSICAL', 'Darren Criss, Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand, Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis, Sunset Blvd.\nJonathan Groff, Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart, A Wonderful World\nJeremy Jordan, Floyd Collins', ""The race: There are six very worthy nominees here instead of five—the result of a tie in the nominating process—but the general feeling is that it will come down to Darren Criss and Jonathan Groff. Both are very well-liked, and both are giving first-rate performances. If Groff hadn't won last year for Merrily We Roll Along, he would probably be the favorite for his splashier turn as Bobby Darin in Just in Time. But he did win last year, and back-to-back acting victories in the same category are extremely rare: Only Gwen Verdon (1958 and 1959) and Judith Light (2012 and 2013) have pulled it off. We think that tips the odds slightly toward Criss."", 'BEST ACTRESS IN A PLAY', 'Laura Donnelly, The Hills of California\nMia Farrow, The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson, Purpose\nSadie Sink, John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook, The Picture of Dorian Gray', ""The race: Finally, an easy call! Snook's one-woman, two-dozen-character walk on the Wilde side is the kind of athletic and chameleonic tour de force that voters have a hard time resisting. And they won't. Trust her with your valuables, 'cause Snook is a lock. "", 'BEST ACTOR IN A PLAY', 'George Clooney, Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola, Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill, Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim, Yellow Face\nHenry Lennix, Purpose\nLouis McCartney, Stranger Things: The First Shadow', 'The race: Escola is nonbinary, and had they chosen to compete in the Best Actress category then Snook might have gotten a run for her money. Competing instead for Best Actor, Escola is likely to win with ease for their dazzling and hilarious turn as the quite contrary Mary Todd Lincoln.  ', 'BEST FEATURED ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL', 'Natalie Venetia Belcon, Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel, Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence, Just in Time\nJustina Machado, Real Women Have Curves \nJoy Woods, Gypsy', ""The race: The consensus for some time has been that Belcon will win this award for her very fine work as an imperious singer in Buena Vista Social Club. That may well be exactly what happens. But there are usually a few upsets up the Tonys' sleeve, and they're often in the featured categories. Many people feel that Real Women Have Curves got a raw deal from the nominators, and this category is where voters have a chance to show it a little love by voting for Justina Machado, the comic dynamo who is the show's big, beating heart. "", 'BEST FEATURED ACTOR IN A MUSICAL', 'Brooks Ashmanskas, Smash\nJeb Brown, Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein, Gypsy\nJak Malone, Operation Mincemeat\nTaylor Trensch, Floyd Collins', ""The race: Jak Malone has the takeaway number in Operation Mincemeat—an oasis of sincerity in that show's hectic whirlwind—so he remains the odds-on favorite. But his support is a little soft; some voters admire the performance but think the song itself does a lot of the work. That opens up a possible window for the hilarious Brooks Ashmanskas, who brings gale force to a role that plays like a culmination of his decades of character comedy, or the widely adored Danny Burstein, who everyone agrees is perfect as Gypsy's long-suffering Herbie.  "", 'BEST FEATURED ACTRESS IN A PLAY ', 'Tala Ashe, English\nJessica Hecht, Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat, English\nFina Strazza, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young, Purpose', ""The race: This is another of the night's closest races, and it's Hecht and Young at the finish line. Young is spectacularly gifted; she's been nominated in this category for four straight seasons, and won it just last year. If any actor can pull off back-to-back wins, she's a good candidate, and it doesn't hurt that a win for Young would also be a win for Purpose, which might come up empty in other races. But Hecht is a pillar of New York theater whose big scene at the end of Eureka Day was unforgettable, and who has somehow never won a Tony. We suspect that admiration for Hecht's hitherto-underrewarded career will tip the scale slightly in her favor. "", 'BEST FEATURED ACTOR IN A PLAY', 'Glenn Davis, Purpose\nGabriel Ebert, John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue, Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk, Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora, Oh, Mary!', ""The race: Like Hecht, Frances Jue is a beloved industry veteran whose work in Yellow Face was among the best in his long career. But this category has a complicating factor that hers doesn't: Voters tend to pad Best Play victories with other awards, and there aren't many ways to do that for Oh, Mary! We think Ricamora will ride that wave to glory. "", 'BEST DIRECTION OF A MUSICAL', 'Saheem Ali, Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden, Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer, Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd, Sunset Blvd.', ""The race: The likely winners of Best Musical and Best Musical Revival will probably face off in this category, as they often do; Best Musical directors are unlikely to lose to directors of other new musicals. (In the past 30 years, that's only happened to the serially underappreciated Michael Greif. Twice.) Between Arden and Lloyd, Arden has the advantage; not everyone likes the kind of metatheatrical multimedia staging that Lloyd's Sunset Blvd. represents."", 'BEST DIRECTION OF A PLAY', 'Knud Adams, English\nSam Mendes, The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton, Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams, The Picture of Dorian Gray ', ""The race: As noted above, a Best Play victory usually also entails one for Best Director. That points to a win for Sam Pinkleton's expert navigation of Oh, Mary!'s pace and tone. Kip Williams's complicated vision of Dorian Gray also has admirers, but Pinkleton's closest competition is Taymor, whose win would honor the popular but probably otherwise overlooked John Proctor Is the Villain. "", 'BEST CHOREOGRAPHY', 'Joshua Bergasse, Smash\nCamille A. Brown, Gypsy \nPatricia Delgado and Justin Peck, Buena Vista Social Club\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJerry Mitchell, Boop! The Musical', ""The race: Justin Peck won last year for Illinoise, and he's likely to repeat the feat for the beautiful and dynamic dances he created with his wife, Patricia Delgado, for Buena Vista Social Club. But there's considerable support out there for Jerry Mitchell's exuberant work in Boop!, and while Christopher Gattelli is unlikely to win for directing Death Becomes Her, his choreo may earn him a consolation prize. "", 'BEST ORCHESTRATIONS', 'Will Aronson, Maybe Happy Ending\nBruce Coughlin, Floyd Collins\nDavid Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sunset Blvd.\nMarco Paguia, Buena Vista Social Club\nAndrew Resnick and Michael Thurber, Just in Time', ""The race: Buena Vista Social Club is literally about the band, and although the show's superb onstage musicians are already receiving a Special Tony Award for their contributions, the voters' goodwill seems likely to overflow into this category as well. (Just in Time also has an onstage orchestra, though, so it has an outside chance.)"", 'BEST SCENIC DESIGN OF A MUSICAL', 'Rachel Hauck, Swept Away\nDane Laffrey and George Reeve, Maybe Happy Ending\nArnulfo Maldonado, Buena Vista Social Club\nDerek McLane, Death Becomes Her\nDerek McLane, Just in Time', ""The race: Laffrey's longtime creative partnership with director Michael Arden has been a major factor in Arden's success, and nowhere more clearly than in Maybe Happy Ending, in which the set design is almost a fifth character. McLane's double nomination might be a Pyrrhic victory: Those who favor his big, gleaming designs might divide their vote, further facilitating Laffrey's win. "", 'BEST SCENIC DESIGN OF A PLAY', 'Miriam Buether and 59 (Benjamin Pearcy and Leo Warner), Stranger Things: The First Shadow \nMarsha Ginsberg, English\nMarg Horwell and David Bergman, The Picture of Dorian Gray\nRob Howell, The Hills of California\nScott Pask, Good Night, and Good Luck', ""The race: Stranger Things may not impress everyone as a drama, but there's no denying it's a majestic spectacle. The set is a huge—and we mean huge—part of that. There's a shipwreck onstage! It's going to win."", 'BEST COSTUME DESIGN OF A MUSICAL', 'Dede Ayite, Buena Vista Social Club \nGregg Barnes, Boop! The Musical\nClint Ramos, Maybe Happy Ending\nPaul Tazewell, Death Becomes Her\nCatherine Zuber, Just in Time', ""The race: It's been a triumphant year for Paul Tazewell, who won an Oscar in March for Wicked and whose wild ensembles are among Death Becomes Her's most memorable elements. His main competition in this category is fellow ten-time Tony nominee Gregg Barnes, whose costumes for Boop! are equally spectacular in eye-popping color and in shades of black and white. Barnes has won more often and more recently, though, and this category is the most obvious place to reward Death Becomes Her's over-the-top style. "", 'BEST COSTUME DESIGN OF A PLAY', 'Brenda Abbandandolo, Good Night, and Good Luck\nMarg Horwell, The Picture of Dorian Gray\nRob Howell, The Hills of California\nHolly Pierson, Oh, Mary!\nBrigitte Reiffenstuel, Stranger Things: The First Shadow', ""The race: The Stranger Things design juggernaut probably won't extend to this race, where voters are more likely to be torn between Pierson's deliberately simplistic, paper-doll designs for Oh, Mary! and Horwell's equally deliberately ornate ones for The Picture of Dorian Gray. If Oh, Mary! wins in this early category, it will be a good sign that it's headed for a sweep. But we think this one lands in the Gray zone. "", 'BEST LIGHTING DESIGN OF A MUSICAL', 'Jack Knowles, Sunset Blvd.\nTyler Micoleau, Buena Vista Social Club\nBen Stanton, Maybe Happy Ending\nJustin Townsend, Death Becomes Her\nScott Zielinski and Ruey Horng Sun, Floyd Collins', ""The race: Best Lighting is often Most Lighting, where voters are concerned, and Sunset Blvd. undeniably has the most lighting of these five. It's also highly accomplished on a technical level, and central to the production's aesthetic. "", 'BEST LIGHTING DESIGN OF A PLAY', 'Natasha Chivers, The Hills of California\nJon Clark, Stranger Things: The First Shadow \nHeather Gilbert and David Bengali, Good Night, and Good Luck\nNatasha Katz and Hannah Wasileski, John Proctor Is the Villain\nNick Schlieper, The Picture of Dorian Gray\n\nThe race: Again: Most Lighting. Stranger Things has more lighting than the other four combined. If the voters are feeling rebellious, however, this could be where John Proctor sneaks in.', 'BEST SOUND DESIGN OF A MUSICAL', 'Jonathan Deans, Buena Vista Social Club\nAdam Fisher, Sunset Blvd.\nPeter Hylenski, Death Becomes Her\nPeter Hylenski, Just in Time\nDan Moses Schreier, Floyd Collins ', ""The race: We think this is ultimately a race between Sunset Blvd.'s well-executed blare and Buena Vista Social Club's more organic approach, which renders the music with exceptional clarity. We give Sunset a slight edge."", 'BEST SOUND DESIGN OF A PLAY', 'Paul Arditti, Stranger Things: The First Shadow \nPalmer Hefferan, John Proctor Is the Villain\nDaniel Kluger, Good Night and Good Luck\nNick Powell, The Hills of California\nClemence Williams, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'The race: This is another race where Stranger Things will probably happen.

Tony Awards 2025: Who Will Win and Who Should Win,https://www.thewrap.com/tony-awards-2025-who-will-win-and-who-should-win/,"['Audra McDonald would walk away with a “Gypsy” win if she weren’t the Meryl Streep of Broadway, and Cole Escola will have a big night for “Oh, Mary!”', 'Let’s begin with the biggest question mark of this year’s Tony Awards: Which playwright is going to win the prize for Best Play?', 'On paper, before the 2024-25 season barely got started, it looked like it would be either Sanaz Toossi for her play “English,” which had won a 2023 Pulitzer Prize, or Jez Butterworth, who was returning to Broadway with his most recent West End hit, “The Hills of California.”', 'Now, Toossi and Butterworth look the least likely to win, and not because their respective plays have already closed. The Cinderella story of this theater season is Kimberly Belflower and her Broadway debut play, “John Proctor Is the Villain,” which panders to the liberal choir even more than Toossi’s “English.”', 'Tony voters may feel that it’s enough that Belflower, an educator from Appalachian Georgia, simply got nominated, and the contest is more between Cole Escola and the wild farce “Oh, Mary!” and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and his wild family comedy “Purpose.” Jacobs-Jenkins might be a shoo-in if not for the fact that his play “Appropriate” won last year for Best Revival of a Play. Escola might be seen to be a shoo-in if not for the fact that they are also nominated this season for Best Actor in a Play. “Purpose,” however, has the distinct advantage of being trashed by the chief theater critic at the New York Times, despite the play winning a 2025 Pulitzer Prize and being praised by most critics. The Tony voters like nothing better than giving the finger to the Old Gray Lady. My prediction is that Jacobs-Jenkins will win for Best Play and Escola for Best Actor, and both deservedly so.', 'Big winner of the night looks to be “Maybe Happy Ending,” which could easily take home the Tonys for not only Best Musical but also Best Actor in a Musical (Darren Criss), Best Director of a Musical (Michael Arden), Best Book and Best Score (Hue Park and Will Aronson). For me, this contest quality-wise is a toss-up between “Maybe Happy Ending” and the equally great but very different “Dead Outlaw” and its writers Itamar Moses, David Yazbek and Erik Penna. The edge goes to Park and Aronson since their musical also marks their Broadway debuts.', 'As a member of the New York Drama Critics’ Circle, I get to vote on the Tonys, and my vote for Best Actor in a Musical will be going to Jeremy Jordan for his phenomenal turn in “Floyd Collins.” But my vote aside, this Tony is going to Criss.', 'Twenty-five of the critics who comprise the Critics’ Circle recently voted on the best of the 2024-25 theater season. Critics in other groups don’t get to vote, so their awards to performers mean a little less than whom the Circle recently honored. The Circle gave its Best Performance award to Andrew Scott for “Vanya,” but since that one-person show is staged Off-Broadway, he’s not eligible for a Tony. Runners-up for that Circle award were Escola (“Oh, Mary!”), Sarah Snook (“The Picture of Dorian Gray”) and, surprisingly, Jasmine Amy Rogers (“Boop!”).', 'Snook looks likely to win for Best Actress in a Play, although I’ll be voting for LaTanya Richardson Jackson in “Purpose.”', 'Rogers has a less secure lock on Best Actress in a Musical. Her biggest competition is Nicole Scherzinger from “Sunset Blvd.” Surprisingly, Scherzinger didn’t get that many votes from the Critics’ Circle, and her comment endorsing Russell Brand’s pro-MAGA Instagram post last fall will put off more than a few Tony voters. Audra McDonald deserves to win for her performance in “Gypsy,” but McDonald is the Meryl Streep of the Tonys. In other words, “Her again?” If this were McDonald’s first nomination, which it is for both Rogers and Scherzinger, and not her 11th, the “Gypsy” star would win hands-down.', 'The George Wolfe-directed “Gypsy” deserves to win for Best Revival of a Musical, but the Tonys have tipped their hat here by snubbing him for Best Director of a Musical and instead nominating Jamie Lloyd for his over-the-top direction of “Sunset Blvd.”', 'Sam Pinkleton of “Oh, Mary!” deserves to win for Best Director of a Play, and he will.', 'Ditto Natalie Venetia Belcon (“Buena Vista Social Club”) for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and the thrice-Tony-nominated Jessica Hecht (“Eureka Day”) for Best Featured Actress in a Play.', 'Jonathan Spector’s “Eureka Day” deserves the Tony for Best Revival of a Play, but will get major competition from David Henry Hwang’s “Yellow Face.”', 'Taylor Trensch from “Floyd Collins” should win for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, but Jak Malone from “Operation Mincemeat” will take home this Tony, because he gets to sing the show’s only memorable song, “Dear Bill.”', 'Glenn Davis in “Purpose” gives one of the season’s most subtle performances, but being understated doesn’t bring you the Tony for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

Tony Awards Predictions 2025: Who Will Win and Who Should Win,https://www.elle.com/culture/theater/a64745629/tony-awards-predictions-2025/,"['ELLE’s theater super fan gives his predictions for the ceremony, airing on CBS June 8.', 'As another Broadway season comes to a close, I once again find myself stressing out over one of the hardest tasks I face year after year: Predicting the winners for the Tony Awards. In yet another highly competitive season, the divas were out, the revivals were dazzling, and the new shows brought a refreshing charm. With 14 new musicals, 14 new plays, seven musical revivals, and seven play revivals, this season, in sheer numbers, blew last year out of the water.', 'Standing at the top of the pack for the musicals with 10 nominations each are Buena Vista Social Club, Death Becomes Her, and Maybe Happy Ending; and leading the plays are The Hills of California and John Proctor Is the Villain. However. But it seems to be anyone’s game, as other shows like Dead Outlaw, Sunset Boulevard, and Oh, Mary! have been fan favorites.', 'Below, find my selects for the season. These are based upon my personal opinion (who should win), and who likely will win based on the odds and Broadway chatter. As always, if those choices differ, it’s due to my personal taste, and the “will win” is still wildly deserving. All of these shows have earned their rightful flowers.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Maybe Happy Ending', 'Should Win: Maybe Happy Ending', 'As one of the world’s biggest softies, it’s unsurprising Maybe Happy Ending is my pick for Best Musical. With direction by Michael Arden, the bite-sized one act is a visual feast. There are drones, projections that are actually effective and not gratuitous, strong costumes, and so much more. Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen are also compelling as the two leads, vocalizing in perfect harmony and telling the story of two retired “helperbots” who are nearing the end of their respective lives. The concept originally seems zany, however the show is everything a new Broadway musical should be. If all is right in the world, Maybe Happy Ending should take home the grand prize.', 'Possible Upset: Dead Outlaw has been well received, has a fascinating plot, and is inventive in its storytelling. It is truly an excellent production, and it could take home this prize as well.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Oh, Mary!', 'Expect Oh, Mary! to say “Oh, Tony!” on awards night. Cole Escola’s play sent shockwaves through the theater community, so much that the downtown production was able to transfer to Broadway. Many were skeptical if the off-Broadway blockbuster would work in a larger venue at first, but those skeptics are now eating their words. Escola’s masterpiece, which tells the story of a disgruntled Mary Todd Lincoln who just wants to be a cabaret star, is an unequivocal hit. It is one of the most creative stories Broadway has seen in recent memory, and it’s cultural impact likely will not be ignored.', 'Should Win: John Proctor is the Villain', 'Personally, John Proctor is the Villain is my favorite show of the Broadway season. From the first Lorde track that plays (“Team” for wondering minds), I was completely enamored. Set in a small, Georgia town during the #MeToo era in 2018, the play examines The Crucible from a new lens, one that does not place John Proctor as the hero he is often portrayed to be. Sadie Sink gives a career-high performance, and the show’s message feels relevant, even seven years later.', 'Possible Upset: This is a highly competitive category. The Hills of California stands as one of my early season favorites, and both Purpose and English have strong followings.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sunset Boulevard', 'Sunset Boulevard has been a smash this Broadway season, and the Andrew Lloyd Weber musical will likely take home this prize. With direction by Jamie Lloyd and a career-defining performance by Nicole Scherzinger, Sunset Boulevard has been pleasing crowds since the fall (even earlier if you count its West End run). That said, it wasn’t my personal favorite; while the show has been the talk of the town, I left the theater feeling a little disappointed. Yes, this one will win, but perhaps it just wasn’t quite for me.', 'Should Win: Gypsy', 'On the other hand, Gypsy was for me. With incredible performances, it’s a Broadway revival at its best. Though it runs long at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Gypsy filled a big musical hole in my heart and had me in the palm of its hand from beginning to end. It’s also impossible to mention the show without mentioning Audra McDonald, who is transcendent in the role of Rose.', 'Possible Upset: This race has two horses, an upset seems unlikely.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Eureka Day', 'Should Win: Eureka Day', 'Eureka Day has emerged as the deserving frontrunner in this quiet category. With a message about vaccinations at college universities that is unfortunately relevant right now, it has the Tony on lock. Not even Kit Connor’s biceps and pull-ups in Romeo + Juliet could challenge this one.', 'Possible Upset: Eureka Day seems to have this category stitched up.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Darren Criss', 'Criss will likely finally get his flowers on Tony night for his compelling performance as a retired helperbot named Oliver in Maybe Happy Ending. Tony voters will likely award one of the show’s stars, especially after his co-lead Helen J. Shen was somehow snubbed from a nomination. It’s looking like Blaine Anderson will get that Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Jonathan Groff', 'Look, was Groff (or the producers) pandering to me when he picked me, out of everyone in the audience, to dance and twirl with at the top of the show? Perhaps. Did it work? Absolutely. Groff stars as Bobby Darin in Just in Time, an excellent musical that didn’t receive as many nominations as it should have. Because Groff just won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical last year for his performance in Merrily We Roll Along, it seems unlikely he’ll win a consecutive award. He is charming, looks amazing in a blue Speedo, and sings his damn heart out. If I were a Tony voter, last year aside, he would get my vote.', 'Possible Upset: Tom Francis demands your attention in Sunset Boulevard as Joe Gillis, and if the tides start turning in that direction on Tony night, Francis could go home with the award.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Audra McDonald', 'Should Win: Audra McDonald', 'About a week ago, I would have said Scherzinger would be taking home his award for her performance as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. It seemed as if she had the momentum, however I always believed McDonald gave the more compelling performance in Gypsy. While the race is still close, it seems as if the pendulum has swung for McDonald, especially after she has been a pinnacle of grace following Patti LuPone’s rude comments towards her (LuPone has since apologized). Controversy aside, I have never, in the many Broadway shows I have watched, seen such a masterclass performance. McDonald sings beautifully, acts with a dominant force, and is addictive as Rose. McDonald had nothing left to prove after winning a record six Tony Awards, but come Sunday night, expect her to extend her record, raking in number seven.', 'Possible Upset: If Scherzinger and McDonald split the votes, recent Drama Desk winner Jasmine Amy Rogers could rise to the top.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Cole Escola', 'Should Win: Cole Escola', 'Escola is hilarious in Oh, Mary!, and if all is right in the world, they should come home with this prize.Putting their whole body into their portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln, the actor delivered a kind of performance Broadway has never seen before. We should all thank Escola for making us belly-laugh for the last year.', 'Possible Upset: I won’t even entertain an upset here. My stomach couldn’t handle it.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sarah Snook', 'Should Win: Sarah Snook', 'Snook, who comes to the Broadway stage after captivating audiences in Succession, acts with giant, pre-recorded versions of herself in this one-woman-show rendition of The Picture of Dorian Gray. It’s an impressive feat, and if she is off by one beat, the whole show could fall apart. (Spoiler: She never is.) Expect Snook to come home with her first Tony Award.', 'Possible Upset: This category seems like a lock for Snook, but I would personally be just as fine with Laura Donnelly or Sadie Sink winning.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Jak Malone', 'Should Win: Jak Malone', 'Malone has a standout moment as Hester Leggatt in Operation Mincemeat with the song “Dear Bill.” It stops the show in its tracks, bringing heart to the otherwise humorous story. I never thought I would cry in a British comedy musical about World War II, so Malone, I politely curse you for causing the waterworks.', 'Possible Upset: Danny Burstein is great in Gypsy, and Taylor Trensch is one of the best parts of Floyd Collins.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Natalie Venetia Belcon', 'In Buena Vista Social Club, Belcon offers an excellent depiction of singer Omara Portuondo. She drives the story forward in this jukebox musical and she sings her heart out through the show. Known for originating the role of Gary Coleman in Avenue Q, Belcon is back, stronger than ever, and it seems as if she may finally get her first Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Joy Woods', 'At just 25 years old, Woods has already built an impressive resumé. After making her Broadway debut as Catherine Parr in Six, she went viral on TikTok last year with her rendition of “My Days” from The Notebook, in which she played Middle Allie. She is a powerhouse, and her ability to hold her own and excel next to Broadway’s most awarded actor, McDonald, makes her my personal pick for this year.', 'Possible Upset: Julia Knitel covers a lot of ground in Dead Outlaw, and she could be awarded for being a pitch-perfect master of disguise.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Gabriel Ebert', 'Should Win: Gabriel Ebert', 'Fans of Ebert will remember him as originating the role of Mr. Wormwood in Matilda the Musical on Broadway, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Now, in John Proctor Is the Villain, Ebert shows his range as Mr. Smith, who is warm and kind, yet terrifying with a dark past. Ebert’s performance is compelling, meaningful, and spot on. He is beyond deserving of this award.', 'Possible Upset: Francis Jue could win for his role in Yellow Face, and Conrad Ricamora could snatch up an award for Oh, Mary!.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Jessica Hecht', 'With Eureka Day, Hecht racks up her third Tony nomination for her turn as Suzanne, and it’s looking like this time, she’ll win. A much beloved actress, she will be welcomed in to the winner’s circle with open arms.', 'Should Win: Fina Strazza', 'At just 19, Fina Strazza shines in John Proctor Is the Villain as the earnest Beth. She’s utterly convincing and often brings levity to the heavy production, and with this Tony nomination, she has a bright future ahead.', 'Possible Upset: Kara Young won this Tony Award last year, and with a much talked about performance in Purpose, she could win for a second consecutive year.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Michael Arden', 'Should Win: Michael Arden', 'Arden’s direction in Maybe Happy Ending is beautiful. With a jaw-dropping set, excellent use of space, and incredible character development, Maybe Happy Ending’s success should be much attributed to Arden. This would be Arden’s second Tony Award, after winning in 2023 for Parade.', 'Possible Upset: Jamie Lloyd gave new life to Sunset Boulevard, and his highly inventive angle could capture the Tony voters’ eyes.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Sam Pinkleton', 'Pinkleton is the perfect director for Oh, Mary!. While he’s mostly known for his work as a choreographer, the play is so unbelievably physical that the pairing just makes sense. Escola is bent almost every which way as Mary, meaning the show needed a master of movement. Pinkleton’s simple staging is effective and well done, more than enough to win him a Tony Award.', 'Should Win: Sam Mendes', 'While I think Pinkleton’s direction is excellent in Oh, Mary!, I found Mendes’s work in The Hills of California to be strong. Mendes, known for directing The Lehman Trilogy, The Ferryman, and Cabaret, is a veteran to the Broadway stage, and his use of age, turntables, and staircases in The Hills of California makes a resounding case for a third Tony Award.', 'Possible Upset: Danya Taymor won Best Director of a Musical last year, and this year, she could come home with Best Director of a play.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck', 'Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck’s choreography in Buena Vista Social Club soars so high that at my show, the company received a standing ovation following the second act’s opener. Their choreography fits the music, is smart, and could win Peck his second consecutive Tony Award in this category.', 'Should Win: Jerry Mitchell', 'At the top of the second act of Boop! The Musical, a perfect match of choreography and costumes makes for one of the best moments in the theater I saw this year, as half the cast is dressed in black and white, and the other half is in full technicolor. Using simple movements to create meaningful visuals is the sign of a strong choreographer, and Mitchell is just that.', 'Possible Upset: We’re either Boopin’ or at the Buena Vista Social Club come Tony Awards night.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'Should Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'With one of the most heartwarming stories Broadway has even seen, it should come as no surprise that Aronson and Park are the frontrunners for this honor. They deserve it too, as the entire audience was sobbing by the end of the tight show.', 'Possible Upset: Itamar Moses wrote an excellent book for Dead Outlaw, telling a jaw-dropping story the outlaw Elmer McCurdy with incredible finesse.', 'Nominees:', 'Will Win: Will Aronson and Hue Park', 'Expect Aronson and Park to clean up this year at the Tony Awards, and their lush score for Maybe Happy Ending will likely earn them this award as well. So rarely in the theater do I come out wishing there was a cast album, but I immediately rushed over to Spotify to check. This score immediately enters a list of musical theater staples.', 'Should Win: Erik Della Penna and David Yazbek', 'The music of Dead Outlaw serves as the beating heart of the show, with the band playing live onstage (and interacting with the characters). Della Penna and Yazbek wrote a score not frequently seen on Broadway with its folk and rock leanings, and for that, I believe the two should be awarded with a glittering trophy.', 'Possible Upset: None, give one of these two the crown.', 'The 78th Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo, will air on CBS and Paramount+ on June 8.', '', 'Gloria Estefan on Representation in Theater', ""Meet the 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow' Cast"", ""Idina Menzel on Her Iconic Red 'Wicked' Jumpsuit"", 'All Your Favorite It Girls Are Off-Broadway', 'For One Night Only, It’s Trisha Paytas', '‘Wicked’ Casts First Black Full-Time Elphaba', 'What a Year to Be a Theater Kid', 'Barbie Ferreira Does What She Wants', 'Marisa Tomei’s True Love Is the Theater', 'Darren Criss & Helen J Shen on Robots and Broadway', 'Get Tickets to See Wicked on Broadway', ""Glindas and Elphabas Reflect on 'Wicked'"", 'A Part of Hearst Digital Media', 'We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.', '©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

The nominations have been made, the in-depth profiles of nominees have been written, our predictions have been nervously lodged. Now there's nothing left but the cheering—and, of course, the singing and dancing."", ""The CBS broadcast on Sunday night will include musical performances by nine of this year's contenders: Best Musical nominees Dead Outlaw, Death Becomes Her, Maybe Happy Ending, Operation Mincemeat and Buena Vista Social Club; and Best Musical Revival nominees Gypsy, Sunset Blvd., Floyd Collins and Pirates!

The original cast of Hamilton is scheduled to take to the stage to commemorate the show's tenth anniversary on Broadway. The show is also sure to include some original numbers—including, we assume, at least one for this year's host, the wickedly talented Cynthia Erivo."", 'RECOMMENDED: A complete guide to the 2025 Tony Awards', 'Here are seven tips for watching the Tony Awards this year.', ""Theater is all about the thrill of the live moment. But until recently, viewers who weren't in the Eastern Time Zone watched the Tony telecast hours after happened. In the age of social media, that kind of delay is increasingly old-fashioned. So CBS now broadcasts the three-hour main portion of the awards ceremony live and simultaneously from coast to coast, starting at 8pm ET, 7pm CT, 6pm MT and 5pm PT. The Tonys will also stream live and on demand on Paramount+. If you're recording it on DVR to watch later, remember that the telecast sometimes runs long. "", 'As has been the case for decades, not all of the 26 races will be included in the televised portion of the Tony ceremony. Many of the prizes will be handed out in the 80 minutes before the CBS telecast begins, including all eight design awards and probably those for book, choreography and orchestrations. The practice of splitting the Tonys into two parts always engenders a certain amount of grumbling from Broadway fans who consider it a slight to the categories in the non-CBS portion. In fact, though, this division is what permits the existence of most of those categories to begin with. (When the telecast included every award, there were only three categories for designers and orchestrators; now there are nine.)', 'That first section of the Tony ceremony, called The Tony Awards: Act One, will be streamed live throughout the country in the ""Pluto TV Celebrity"" section of the free streaming service Pluto TV starting at 6:40pm ET/3:40pm PT. This part of the ceremony will be co-hosted by 2025 nominee Darren Criss and past winner Renée Elise Goldsberry. You\'ll want to make sure that you have Pluto TV installed in advance, because if you\'re a true theater lover, Act One is definitely worth watching.

The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, the highest-grossing season in recorded history, overtaking the pre-pandemic previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season.', 'In terms of attendance, Broadway welcomed nearly 14.7 million ticket buyers, the second best attended season on record, behind only 2018-2019. But sky-high ticket prices have led to fears that Broadway is getting financially out of touch.', 'A revival of “Othello” with Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal broke the record for top-grossing play in Broadway history, with a gross of $2,818,297 for eight performances, fueled by some seats going for as high as $921.', ""Even if you haven't been able to get to Broadway this season, you can still see one of the shows.

"Predictions: Who Will Win Best Director, Choreographer, Score, and Book Tonys in 2025?",https://www.theatermania.com/news/predictions-who-will-win-best-director-choreographer-score-and-book-tonys-in-2025_1780982/,"['Our critics predict the winners in top creative categories.', 'David Gordon', 'Zachary Stewart', 'Pete Hempstead', 'June 2, 2025', 'The winners of the 2025 Tony Awards will be revealed in a televised ceremony on Sunday, June 8. Here are our critics’ predictions for Best Directors of a Musical and a Play, Best Book of a Musical, Best Original Score, and Best Choreography.', 'Best Direction of a Musical\nSaheem Ali, Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden, Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer, Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd, Sunset Blvd.', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: David Cromer', 'David Cromer has long had the most sensitive eye for lighting among the small handful of directors who regularly work on Broadway, but his collaboration with designer Heather Gilbert is extraordinary, with the early scenes materializing in the dark spaces around the band, which is the engine that drives Dead Outlaw. It’s beautiful and understated, pointing the way for future production that won’t enjoy a Broadway budget. But Michael Arden is also doing some next-level work with Maybe Happy Ending, deploying eye-popping projections and a complicated set for a musical that feels simultaneously high-tech and old-fashioned. The Tony voters will appreciate that bridge-building and reward him for it.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: Christopher Gattelli', 'Maybe Happy Ending came out of nowhere and surprised just about everyone who’s seen it with its intriguing set, endearing performances, and charming score. Those surprises don’t come by chance. Michael Arden shows us how you can take something simple and transform it into something extraordinary. But Christopher Gattelli takes something big and makes it even bigger in Death Becomes Her. I’m still laughing about the melee between Jennifer Simard and Megan Hilty that culminated in a slo-mo staircase tumble. Brilliant and hilarious.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Michael Arden\nShould win: Michael Arden', 'In a very un-British way, Sunset Boulevard director Jamie Lloyd is kissing every baby this season – he’s at event after event supporting the show and his nomination, despite being in rehearsals for a major revival of Evita in the West End at the same time. He must really want this one. But Michael Arden is going to win it for finding the heart in a pair of lonely, obsolete robots who fall in love while on a road trip across Korea.', 'Best Direction of a Play\nKnud Adams, English\nSam Mendes, The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton, Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor, John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams, The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Kip Williams\nShould win: Knud Adams', 'I suspect Tony voters will be wowed by the way Williams marshals so many moving parts in the solo adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray, which uses live and recorded video so that Sarah Snook can play opposite herself. It’s impressive, but I was more astounded by the intricately layered performances Knud Adams was able to draw out of every cast member in English, a play that carved out a space on Broadway this season for quietly nuanced drama.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Sam Pinkleton\nShould win: Kip Williams', 'Kip Williams deserves this award for orchestrating the intricate series of technical maneuvers and camera angles that make Sarah Snook’s already breathtaking performance larger than life. But Sam Pinkleton does something equally impressive with a far less expensive set: He creates an outrageous atmosphere of camp and sustained laughter from Cole Escola’s ridiculously funny script. Comedy like that is hard, but Pinkleton makes it look easy.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Sam Pinkleton\nShould win: Sam Pinkleton', 'Dying is easy, comedy is hard. But in Oh, Mary!, everyone on stage makes getting a laugh look effortless. It’s all thanks to the finely tuned eye of Sam Pinkleton, who lets his actors be over the top will still managing to reign it in. He spreads his secret sauce all over Mary Todd Lincoln, and it’s perfect.', 'Best Book of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club, Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw, Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her, Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending, Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical, David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'In almost any other season, Itamar Moses would easily take this award for his brilliant dramatic autopsy of a true tale of American entrepreneurship and exploitation in Dead Outlaw. It’s both chilling and hilarious. But this year voters also have the option of awarding Will Aronson and Hue Park’s heartwarming book for Maybe Happy Ending, a love story between two retired robots that will have them thinking about their own marriages and mortality.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Itamar Moses for Dead Outlaw\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'Maybe Happy Ending is one of the most charming and original stories that a Broadway has seen in recent years. Having said that, Dead Outlaw is the most original. Who would have thought that a corpse would have such an entertaining musical in it! Itamar Moses did. That kind of vision along with terrific execution deserves the award.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts for Operation Mincemeat\nShould win: Itamar Moses for Dead Outlaw', 'In my mind, this is the only category (other than Featured Actor in a Musical) where Operation Mincemeat has the chance to win, so I think voters will spread the love its way accordingly. The most original book this season is Dead Outlaw, which Itamar Moses tells like a murder ballad and a ghost story all at the same time.', 'Best Original Score\nDead Outlaw, David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her, Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending, Will Aronson (music and lyrics) and Hue Park (lyrics)\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical, David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves: The Musical, Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'This is another category where the race comes down to two frontrunners: Dead Outlaw and Maybe Happy Ending. While Yazbek and Della Penna use a vast range of American musical styles (but most effectively rock) to tell their grim all-American story, Aronson and Park have set their futuristic musical to a jazz score that sound like old Broadway, even if the show is about South Korean robots. I predict the latter score, full of earworm melodies and clever lyrics, will take it by a hair.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'Operation Mincemeat‘s standout number is “Dear Bill,” but I found most of the other numbers forgettable. Dead Outlaw showcases some head-bobbing rock among other musical genres, making it by far the most eclectic score out of these nominees. But Maybe Happy Ending feels the most cohesive and well-crafted, with a roster of a couple dozens songs each of which tickle the ear and contribute to the story. It will edge out the others.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending\nShould win: Will Aronson and Hue Park for Maybe Happy Ending', 'This is a category filled with just ok scores. The jazzy tunes of Maybe Happy Ending are the most ok of them all, even if the album I’m playing over and over is Dead Outlaw.', 'Best Choreography\nJoshua Bergasse, SMASH\nCamille A. Brown, Gypsy\nChristopher Gattelli, Death Becomes Her\nJerry Mitchell, BOOP! The Musical\nPatricia Delgado and Justin Peck, Buena Vista Social Club', 'Zachary Stewart\nWill win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck for Buena Vista Social Club\nShould win: Joshua Bergasse for SMASH', 'Justin Peck won this category last year for Illinoise, and it seems likely he’ll get a repeat with collaborator Patricia Delgado for the excellent dancing in Buena Vista Social Club. It’s one of the few categories this show has a fighting chance to win. But my heart is with Joshua Bergasse, whose imaginative choreography for SMASH was a loving tribute to old Broadway and its reigning queen, director Susan Stroman.', 'Pete Hempstead \nWill win: Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck for Buena Vista Social Club\nShould win: Jerry Mitchell for BOOP! The Musical', 'Buena Vista Social Club‘s choreography contributes to the storytelling as much as the score does, and it’s performed so energetically that it’s hard to not stand up in your seat and join in. But Jerry Mitchell created some equally exciting dance numbers in BOOP!, particularly an inspired Act 2 opener. I’d be just as happy to see this one win.', 'David Gordon\nWill win: Jerry Mitchell for BOOP! The Musical\nShould win: Camille A. Brown for Gypsy', 'In this category, Camille A. Brown had the hardest job — choreographing all new moves for Gypsy, a musical that has relied on the Jerome Robbins strobes for 60 years. I’d like to see her finally get it, but I would never begrudge Jerry Mitchell, a lovely man and clever thinker who created one of the best production numbers ever in act-two opener “Where Is Betty?”', ""Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!"", 'Now available for unlimited viewings.', ""Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!"", 'By providing information about entertainment and cultural events on this site, TheaterMania.com shall not be deemed to endorse, recommend, approve and/or guarantee such events, or any facts, views, advice and/or information contained therein.', '©1999-2025 TheaterMania.com, Inc.

The 2025 Tonys: 'Give It Everything Or Die Trying',https://www.papermag.com/broadway-tonys-2025,"['The current batch of luminaries lighting up Broadway is making sky-high ticket pricing less of an issue; these stars are worth every penny! As the Tony Awards approach, this Sunday, June 8, we caught up with a stellar assemblage of such performers, all of whom richly deserve the lens — and the applause. With no fewer than 40 shows filling Broadway theaters right now, this is their stage door moment, and we’re there for a high five. And naturally, we dolled them up in designer drollery that we could all agree on and got photographic evidence that we were in the room with them. Kindly make some noise for...', '', '', 'Clothing: Vintage via Ebreo Vintage, Jewelry: Alexis', 'When producer Jeffrey Richards and director Michael Arden separately came to him with a robot musical called Maybe Happy Ending, Darren Criss knew it had to be something special. And he became enamored of it, seizing the chance to eventually step into a fully ready production and be part of the magic. In the one-act, lovely Korean musical — where fireflies represent life’s fleeting beauty — Criss and Helen J. Shen play Oliver and Claire, two helperbots in Korea who develop a poignant personal connection. Actor/singer Criss became widely known as openly gay alumnus Blaine Anderson on Glee and won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for playing Gianni Versace’s killer, Andrew Cunanan, on The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.. Now he’s nabbed his first Tony nomination for his robot portrayal and he’s over the moon about the dazzlingly designed show’s across-the-boards success.', '“It’s the most accessible show I’ve ever been in,” gushes the affable Criss. “I’ve never been in a show that people come back for this many times. People want to bring people they love. It’s a show for people who know everything about theater. It’s a show for people who know nothing about theater. No matter who you are, this show should speak to you — and if not, maybe you’re a robot,” he says, laughing.', 'One of his favorite elements of MHE is the breakout performance of costar Shen, who, like him, is a graduate of the University of Michigan. “It’s a privilege to be present — to get a seat in the house — for a stunning debut for the books,” he says.', 'Criss will also be present on Sunday night, when he and Renée Elise Goldsberry host The Tony Awards: Act One, a live pre-show on Pluto TV from 6:40 to 8:00 PM. And then come the Tonys! And if that’s not enough on his plate, he and his wife — producer/entrepreneur Mia — happen to have two adorable children, aged one and three.', 'As an actor, Criss wants to keep surprising the masses. “I enjoy confusing people,” he admits. “I hear stuff like, ‘Oh, you’re an actor?’ and ‘I didn’t realize you did music!’”', 'Coat and skirt: Marina Moscone, Shoes: Herbert Levine, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Coat and skirt: Shushu/tong, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', '“It’s been such a whirlwind,” says Helen J. Shen, who’s making her Broadway debut in the 10-times-Tony-nominated Maybe Happy Ending, after making her mark off-Broadway (Teeth) and elsewhere. “Broadway has always been a dream of mine, but it’s not something I could have manifested and predicted,” she enthuses. “The fact that it happened this quickly and on this scale is beyond my wildest dreams. Every day, I’m having another ‘pinch-me’ moment.”', 'New Jersey–born, via parents from Shanghai, Shen is a 25-year-old talent who went from playing classical piano in European competitions to starring in musical theater in America. She’s superb as the tender robot, and soars on “How To Be Not Alone,” where she starts entertaining the complex but worthwhile process of letting another being into your personal sphere. “I love that song,” she relates. “The writer pointed out that it’s not a romantic love song, so it’s not the time to be saccharine.”', 'Re: her fellow bot, Darren Criss: “He’s such a student. He’s always learning and trying to better himself. I love his youthful energy and willingness to be new at something. It’s his first cast album and first time originating a role. At times, he’s a mentor, and other times we share the newness.”', 'As Shen’s own newness starts to shed, what’s in her future? “What happens when your dream comes true so soon?” she wonders out loud. “Now what?” It will be rewarding to observe.', '(On Darren) Clothing: Vintage, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar (On Helen) Coat and skirt: Marina Moscone, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress and shoes: Michael Kors Collection, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress and shoes: Michael Kors Collection, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', '“I was uncomfortable,” Joy Woods admits, about her insecurity when she started playing the awkward Louise, who eventually becomes Gypsy Rose Lee, in the hit revival of Gypsy. “I hadn’t nailed the character and I didn’t have the confidence to know I was doing it justice. And I was with vets [Tony winners Audra McDonald as her domineering Mama Rose and Danny Burstein as fascinated manager Herbie] onstage.”', 'Perhaps adding to the performance pressure is that this is a landmark production spotlighting Black characters — and as Woods explains it, Josephine Baker’s aesthetics have been introduced into the proceedings (“She was the most prominent burlesque woman of color”). What the refreshingly humble Woods — a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in NYC — came to realize is that Louise simply wants to be seen and heard. She wants Mama to notice her.', 'And Woods (a Catherine Parr replacement in Six and Middle Allie in The Notebook) has arrived. “I’m getting my footing,” she contends. No kidding! She nails the stripping, the dramatics, and also the lighter moments — such as the song “Together,” with her, McDonald, and Burstein playfully camping it up. “We have so much fun,” she exults. “They’re delightful.”', 'As for getting Tony-nominated for Best Performance By an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical on her third Broadway outing? “It’s pretty surreal,” coos Woods. “I certainly didn’t expect it, especially with this extraordinary season.” Her future goals? “To learn. And grow up. Empathy is involved in what we do. Being a good actor is being a good person.”', 'Shirt: Ami, Pants: Vintage, Rings: Alexis Bittar', 'Operation Mincemeat is a hilarious British musical with a cast of five in multiple roles, telling the fascinating true story of how a repurposed corpse managed to stave off the Nazis and help us win WWII. Tony nominee Jak Malone is a standout as MI5 employee Hester Leggatt, and other characters. He says that the cast’s adrenalized, manic energy “comes from having no choice. You have to give 100% or go home. Give it everything you have or die trying.”', 'In Malone’s case, he ends up delivering “Dear Bill,” a potent ballad that stops the show (and which I won’t give away; everyone possible needs to experience this four-Tony-nominated romp in person). “I feel like I’m sitting on a secret,” he admits about the dramatic change of tone his song ultimately effects. “I’m thinking, ‘Enjoy this, everyone, because in a minute, I’m going to shatter your hearts with this tale of grief!’”', 'Malone’s own story is far more lighthearted. He grew up in Merseyside, England, loving Broadway cast albums and desperately wanting to perform on our stages. “Broadway was this beacon of joy to me,” he relates. “I thought, ‘I’d love to go there and find joy’ — and that’s what’s happened!”', 'Dress: Michael Kors Collection, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Best known for playing fashion blogger Haley Dunphy on Modern Family, Manhattan-born Sarah Hyland stepped into Broadway’s hit musical The Great Gatsby as shallow socialite Daisy Buchanan in February, and is loving it. As she puts it: “The story is still so relatable — so much has changed since the 1920s, but a lot has not, like the classism and misogyny. And for [creators] Kait Kerrigan, Jason Howland, and Nathan Tysen to turn it into this glitzy and glamorous musical and bring it to light and life, along with all the deceit, the betrayal, and the heartbreak, is so beautiful.” As for Daisy, Hyland acknowledges that a lot of people hate her, but she happens to be stuck in an abusive relationship and she’s also trapped in the 1920s. “She’s a survivor and she’s vulnerable,” says Hyland, “and I think her vulnerability makes her strong.” But of course, adds the actress, the only winner in this narrative is always going to be Daisy’s brutish husband Tom Buchanan, and him alone.', 'On a lighter note: Did Hyland learn ensemble acting from her time on Modern Family? “Yes! I’ve always felt I’m just an ensemble actor, and I think it’s a good thing. It means you’re not there for yourself. You’re there for everyone else.” But the best education of all, she says, laughing, “was singing show tunes in the corner with Jesse Tyler Ferguson!”', 'Blazer, trousers, shirt and cummerbund: Dunhill, Bow tie: Ralph Lauren', 'Andrew Durand lies still in a coffin for Act Two of Dead Outlaw, but don’t worry, he has plenty to do in the first half.', 'Georgia-born Durand plays Elmer McCurdy, the real-life title character who went from small-time crook to gawked-at corpse in carnival shows. And now, he’s nominated for Best Performance By an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and feels very much alive.', 'Durand will never be standard leading-man material, which is probably the best thing about him. He’s always shone in offbeat musicals like Head Over Heels, Shucked, and his current show, while steering clear of more commercial stuff, whether by choice or by instinct. He remembers auditioning as a replacement Christian in Moulin Rouge! The Musical and not being able to connect with the material. “I couldn’t find a specific point of view,” he admits, which wasn’t all that surprising. That tourist-driven “can-can” was better left to someone more mainstream to “do do.”', 'But playing McCurdy happens to provide the quirkiness he craves, and, even better, it’s not presented in a completely black-and-white manner. Durand likes the way glimmers of the character’s humanity are shown, where the future corpse might actually follow the path to success and decency. That he ultimately doesn’t is what provides the drama.', 'Durand’s own path started when he acted with the local Playhouse at age 10 and loved the experience — “Adults acting goofy onstage, and also letting me do stuff like paint sets and sell popcorn.” Well, the treats are a bit pricier now since Durand has started to carve out his own legend. Says he: “I’ve loved this community since I was 10. To have that reception reflected back at me feels really good. I walk through rooms of other Tony nominees and realize, ‘Oh, yes, I do belong here.’ I guess I’ve slowly and subtly worked my way up.”', ""Dress: Stylist's own, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar"", ""Dress; Stylist's own, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar"", 'One of the delights of Real Women Have Curves — about a factory of female immigrants in 1980s L.A. straining to make a 200-dress deadline — is the irresistible Justina Machado, the Chicago-born actress from Six Feet Under and many other TV/streaming credits. As Carmen Garcia,Machado has to not only stitch like a demon, she has to learn to sew up a problem involving her daughter (Ana, played by Tatianna Córdoba) needing the space to grow. “Carmen wants her to do great things,” says the ebullient Machado, “but the great things she wants her to do.”', '“Sounds like my mother,” I laughed, and she replied, “Mine too.”', '“I’m Puerto Rican from Chicago,” Tony-nominated Machado exulted with fire. “People forget that Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. It’s so disgusting what’s happening to immigrants in this country. Yes, the show is timely, but the situation has been a part of this community for a long time.”', 'Naturally, the show touches on that subject, along with some lighter themes. One highlight, the metaphorical song “Adios, Andrés,” has Machado wackily thinking she’s pregnant when in fact she’s experiencing menopause. (“Andrés, who comes every month, ain’t coming no more,” she is bluntly told by a co-worker.) Another showstopper is the title song, where all the factory women shed their outer garments and sing out with pride. Machado says they had an intimacy counselor work out the song with them in rehearsal, “so we felt safe.”', 'Interestingly, the actress played the daughter, Ana, in a nonmusical version of the same show, back in 1992. “But I don’t even remember Ana,” she exclaims. “That was 32 years ago!” That’s okay. Her Carmen is helping us through.', 'Suit: Tanner Fletcher, Brooch and rings: Alexis Bittar', 'Jennifer Simard has not only received acclaim for the year’s most purely enjoyable musical, Death Becomes Her — based on the 1992 film farce about warring ex-best-friends battling for longevity — but she’s trending on TikTok because of it. Her character’s mid-show statement — “That was rude. That was pretty fucking rude” (pronounced after she’s been shot by her rival) — has become popular on social media, and the wildest people have been adopting it. In fact, while many of us have spent our lives lip-syncing to Madonna, Madge herself posted a video of herself lip-syncing to Simard!', 'A deadpan scream as vengeful author Helen Sharp, New Hampshire–born Simard has bagged her third Tony nomination in the process. (Previous ones were for Disaster! and Company.) Accessing her ample comic gifts, Simard makes the character quirky and complicated — two words she approves of because they describe herself (“though I think I was quirkier in my youth”). In fact, more than just an actress, she’s studying psychology, readily quotes Walt Whitman (“I am large. I contain multitudes”), and has decided that “Age is a state of mind. You always have an opportunity to live your best life.” The nomination is obviously part of that, though Simard cracks, “If you ever want to see the most competitive category, look for Jennifer Simard’s name!” Aww. That’s pretty fucking rude of them, lol.', 'Was there any concern that — until plotlines resolve — DBH could be perceived as a musical about women hating each other? “[Costar] Megan Hilty and I talked about that,” says Simard, whose all-time icons are Madeline Kahn and Bernadette Peters. “But the show is a love story between two women. True hate is about indifference. They’re not indifferent to each other. They make each other alive.” Along with the help of a little potion, perhaps.', ""Tracksuit: Tanner Fletcher, Hankerchief: Stylist's own, Rings: Alexis Bittar"", 'We now know why Mary Todd Lincoln had such issues. It turns out hubby Abe Lincoln was diddling with guys the whole time, at least according to Cole Escola’s smash camp comedy, Oh, Mary! Tony-nominated Conrad Ricamora — who was Oliver Hampton in How To Get Away With Murder — is hilarious as the philandering president, with Escola a scream as the wacky wife, who has her own secret — she’s fantasizing about becoming a cabaret star.', 'Ricamora grew up in California, where his school didn’t have acting courses — just Speech and Debate. But in college he went to a drama class, “and I was hooked,” especially when a randomly assigned monologue from Lanford Wilson’s Lemon Sky tapped into his yearnings for his mom (who’d divorced dad when Conrad was a kid).', 'Ricamora says there’s plenty of evidence that, indeed, Honest Abe was gay or bi. Whenever Mary was away, Abe shared his bed with a soldier — and not for warmth, either. Ricamora credits director Sam Pinkleton for daring to cast him (part Filipino) in the role, whereas so many offers tend to be of the stereotypical King and I or Flower Drum Song persuasion.', ""He's also grateful for Escola — “the most alive and present person I’ve ever acted with. They’re never calculating their next choice or existing in their bubble.”"", 'Is it weird going up against his old Soft Power costar Francis Jue (Yellow Face) for the Tony? “I don’t have that mindset. I played competitive tennis growing up — that was different.

Back in the closet!', 'Pants: Stella McCartney, Shoes: Sportmax', 'In Jamie Lloyd’s dramatic reimagination of Sunset Boulevard, aging diva Norma Desmond (Nicole Scherzinger) is pretty much batshit, whereas a younger woman — wannabe Hollywood hotshot Betty Schaefer — is more logically calculating, hoping to get her screenplays noticed, thanks to her association with pal Joe Gillis (Tom Francis). British actress Grace Hodgett Young makes her Broadway debut as Betty, and says she initially wasn’t aware of Lloyd’s avant-garde approach to the material, which ended up involving giant screens, smoke machines, and cell phones. “I had no idea what I was in for,” she says, smiling. “At the audition, he kept saying, ‘Make it smaller.’ Then I realized it was because we were going to be on camera.”', 'The result galvanized U.K. audiences, but Hodgett Young says American crowds have been even more vocal about it. “The audiences are much louder,” she says. “In the West End, they’re very British and polite.” Here, Scherzinger gets a standing ovation in the middle of every single performance. “She’s really the hardest working person I’ve ever worked with,” gushes Hodgett Young. “She is always seeking to learn.”', 'Top and jacket: Thom Browne, Shorts: Gucci, Shoes: Alaia, Socks: Free People', 'Top and jacket: Thom Browne, Shorts: Gucci, Shoes: Alaia, Socks: Free People', 'An explosive talent, Gracie Lawrence sings like Christina Aguilera crossed with Streisand, but with her own quirky style — and she features that talent in a soul pop band named Lawrence that also includes her brother, Clyde, and various friends since childhood. But she’s currently Tony-nominated for playing 1950s chart-topping belter Connie Francis in Just in Time, the Broadway musical where Jonathan Groff is Bobby Darin, the snazzy but doomed crooner Francis fell for, thanks to the slings and arrows of “Stupid Cupid.”', '“I try to capture the expressiveness of her voice,” says Lawrence. “I don’t want to do an impression because that might take away from honoring her, but I noticed a way she emotes. She holds a note, then lets it fall.” It’s the teardrop effect. And Francis was crying for a reason; she’s long been frank about having been devastated when her dad wouldn’t let her marry Darin, the absolute love of her life.', '“In that time,” says New York–born Lawrence, “she had to present as graceful, pure and sweet, while the reality she was living had a lot of struggle and darkness.” On the bright side, Francis’s old song “Pretty Little Baby” surprisingly shot to No.1 on the TikTok chart just recently. Perhaps buoyed by the Broadway show, the woman is hotter than ever.', 'Lawrence (whose father, Marc Lawrence, co-wrote Miss Congeniality) said she got the part because director/creator Alex Timbers is a fan of her band and flat out asked her to play it. She admires costar Groff because, “He does eight shows a week. He’s onstage the entire show. He’s always given a million percent to the show and to the people around him personally.” As she said this, I could have sworn I heard a teardrop in her voice.', 'Dress: Shao, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'Dress: Shao, Shoes: Jimmy Choo, Jewelry: Alexis Bittar', 'A phenomenon in the making, the magnetically talented Kara Young has nabbed her fourth Tony nomination in a row, for playing Aziza, a friend of the son of a dysfunctional family in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s Purpose. (She won last year for her wide-eyed Lutiebelle in Purlie Victorious.) The Harlem-born free spirit — a proxy for the audience — watches the dysfunctional goings on with a half smile and eyes popped open.', 'Young praises director Phylicia Rashad for planting ideas in her head that grew into helpful dollops of the character’s development. “I’m constantly looking for notes and direction,” she explains, “in continually trying to excavate or keep adding new ingredients to the gumbo of someone’s life.” She says the play’s themes involve reverence, legacy, and clocking the human spirit inside all of these people. One of the lines that haunts her the most is the matriarch character, Claudine (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), saying, “There was a time in this country, not too long ago, when the God-given right to family was considered a luxury for those who looked like us.” That the Jaspers still have a family, however crumbling, is a bona fide achievement.', 'But Young would like to amp up the dysfunction, apparently. She says she’d love to play the zany and macabre Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd — “I think about her pre-Sweeney and the transitioning to having a new man in the house” — though she admits that Aziza is already a dream role. “We’re different, but we’re both from Harlem and have connections. I wish I could be more like her.” Her spirit animal? “New York City!

The Musical has cartoon flapper Betty Boop coming to life and winding up in present-day NYC, where she meets sleazy politician Raymond Demarest (Erich Bergen). That opportunistic character wants Betty as his running mate for mayor, but she scuttles that plan when she finds out that he’s terribly corrupt, boop-boop-a-doop. “Everyone walks out happy,” Bergen says, beaming, about the audience for the frothy show. “They all leave feeling goofy.”', 'Bergen hails from the Chelsea nabe in NYC, and says he can remember passing by the leather bar Rawhide when he was only three. As a kid, he was impressed by his parents’ trendiness (“They met in EST,” a 1970s self-help seminar), his Ma’s fancy art collection, and the sight of Keith Haring doodling in a subway. Bergen attended Stagedoor Manor theater camp, ultimately toured with Jersey Boys (as Four Seasons member Bob Gaudio), then landed in the 2014 Clint Eastwood–directed movie version. He found Eastwood respectful and knowledgeable, “but I had a smart person who saw an early cut and said, ‘You need to get a job, because once this comes out, you won’t be as hot as you are now.’” Bergen landed on Madam Secretary as President Téa Leoni’s personal secretary, Blake Moran, and his character’s coming out is still affecting young queers who catch it on Netflix.', 'Bergen doesn’t care if he writes, produces, or acts, as long as he’s involved. “I hate camp,” he declares. “I hate the term ‘guilty pleasure.’ I think if you love something, it matters to you.”', 'Photography: Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\n\nStyling (Erich, Darren, Grace H., Sarah, Natalie, Joy): Heidi Cannon\nStyling (Helen, Andrew, Jak, Jennifer): Alexa Levine\nStyling (Kara, Conrad, Justina): Joyce Esquenazi Mitrani\nStyling (Gracie): Jules Wettreich\nHair (Gracie): Netty Jordan\nTailoring (Gracie): Janelle Sando\nHair: Dan Williams, Kennedy Trisler\nMakeup: Mollie Gloss', 'Styling assistants: Amanda Van Poznak, Christopher Contaldi, Mo Johnson\nMakeup assistants: Zane Chen, Tasia Mitropoulos\nProduction assistants: Rafael Flores, Dillon Camp', 'Special projects director: Mickey Boardman\nStory: Michael Musto\nPublisher: Brian Calle\n\nAll jewelry by Alexis Bittar']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU1PV3BWZWkxUFkwRnlUV0pQVFJDcUJCaXFCQ2dLTWdhTk1JelZGQVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Who Will Win the 2025 Tony Awards?,https://www.vulture.com/article/tony-awards-predictions-2025.html,"['', '', '', 'After a thrillingly packed Broadway season and an awards campaign that has involved more petitions than I ever expected, the Tonys are coming up on Sunday night. There’s a lot to unpack this year with the incursion of Hollywood stars and franchises onto the Great White Way alongside the rise of some local theater darlings. There are races with obvious favorites as well as races in which the consensus is so fragile it could be tousled by a gust of wind. Which is to say, as always, that all our predictions are 100 percent accurate and you should bet all your money on our advice; then you can go invest it in a musical, famously also a guaranteed way to make money.', 'Best Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club\nDead Outlaw\nDeath Becomes Her\nMaybe Happy Ending\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical', 'It has been a really good year for new musicals! I can pretty much imagine any of these shows beating the crop from last year (sorry, sad wet hunks of The Outsiders). But at this point, the race favors . While Dead Outlaw is a critics’ favorite — I love its dusty wit — I know more than a few people who (wrongly) found it hard to connect with. has the industrial support of its producer Universal, solid sales, and all those TikToks based on its line deliveries, but it’s likely a little down-the-middle to edge in. Maybe Happy Ending has the praise, the Cinderella box-office story, and the emotional sentiment baked into its robot love story to make voters connect with it.', 'Best Play\nEnglish\nThe Hills of California\nJohn Proctor Is the Villain\nOh, Mary!\nPurpose', 'I’ve found it fascinating to watch Oh, Mary! — a box-office hit that has dominated conversations in New York and been a Tony front-runner for a whole season — do sort of an underdog campaign for Best Play. A deranged queer comedy is not your typical winner, but there’s a lot of enthusiasm and, considering Betty Gilpin’s and Tituss Burgess’s runs as Mary, proof that the show can go on with or without its creator, Cole Escola (imagine the stars of all genders who could actress out in it on tour). But there’s a case to be made that Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s family drama Purpose, which has picked up steam after a Pulitzer win, is more meat-and-potatoes Tony fare. There’s maybe an outside chance for the finely honed John Proctor Is the Villain, about teenage girls in Georgia confronting . But Oh, Mary! somehow seems like the safe choice.', 'Best Revival of a Musical\nFloyd Collins\nGypsy\nPirates! The Penzance Musical\nSunset Blvd.', 'Jamie Lloyd’s Sunset revival cut out the original’s vowels, the sets, and a lot of the costumes from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s lumbering musical, then added a bunch of screens and a ferocious Nicole Scherzinger. His amendments aren’t universally loved but they’re striking, and with a revival, it’s often about how much you can see the work done on evolving the original piece. Enough was done here to make it a likely winner. The show’s main rival is Gypsy, though its director, George C. Wolfe, wasn’t nominated for his work on the musical, which may indicate voters are cooler on it as a whole.', 'Best Revival of a Play\nEureka Day\nRomeo + Juliet\nThornton Wilder’s Our Town\nYellow Face', 'The front-runner here is the most recent: Jonathan Spector’s dark comedy about a progressive California school debating its vaccination policies had an Off Broadway production in 2019, which means Manhattan Theatre Club’s version this spring qualifies as a revival. The play was well received, and voting for it gives the Tonys a chance to make a political statement, especially considering RFK Jr.’s appointment as HHS secretary. The other revivals don’t quite have that grip, though Yellow Face was excellent, and Romeo + Juliet has staged a rather bitchy campaign involving the dictionary definition of revival.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\nDarren Criss — Maybe Happy Ending\nAndrew Durand — Dead Outlaw\nTom Francis — Sunset Blvd.\nJonathan Groff — Just in Time\nJames Monroe Iglehart —\nJeremy Jordan — Floyd Collins', 'There are six nominees in this category instead of the typical five thanks to an arcane rule about ties in the nomination voting process, but that’s just the beginning of the goofiness: Tom Francis’s campaign has involved , Andrew Durand stood in a coffin in random places in New York, and Darren Criss has emphasized the of playing a robot. Meanwhile, Jonathan Groff is on talking about getting into leather. So while Criss has a decent shot — and I wish Jeremy Jordan had gotten more attention for singing ’s gorgeous score — Groff has the momentum. Even though he won last year for , his whole show hangs on his personal fascination with mid-century crooner Bobby Darin, and somehow it’s both compelling and a hit.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\nMegan Hilty — Death Becomes Her\nAudra McDonald — Gypsy\nJasmine Amy Rogers — Boop! The Musical\nNicole Scherzinger — Sunset Blvd.\nJennifer Simard — Death Becomes Her', 'Everyone’s favorite category is even more of a nail-biter than usual! Ever since Sunset and Gypsy were announced for the same season, we’ve been speculating about the race between Nicole (who won the Olivier in London) and Audra (who is six-time Tony winner Audra McDonald), and the race between them has fluctuated all season (remember the business ?). Right now, momentum may be breaking toward McDonald. She just picked up a Drama Desk Award, and getting a broadside from Patti LuPone has given the community a reason to rally behind her.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\nGeorge Clooney — Good Night, and Good Luck\nCole Escola — Oh, Mary!\nJon Michael Hill — Purpose\nDaniel Dae Kim — Yellow Face\nHarry Lennix — Purpose\nLouis McCartney — Stranger Things, The First Shadow', 'Sure, George Clooney, you can sell 3 million bucks worth of tickets to a Broadway show in a week, but can you pull off a madcap medley in a billowing black dress? Cole Escola’s a hometown hero who has been hard at work downtown for years and is finally getting deserved adulation. I believe and hope they’ll win.', 'Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\nLaura Donnelly — The Hills of California\nMia Farrow — The Roommate\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson — Purpose\nSadie Sink — John Proctor Is the Villain\nSarah Snook — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Sarah Snook’s performance in Dorian Gray shows the work in a way awards-show voters love to reward: She plays every character, and with the help of a dedicated film crew, performs to recorded versions of herself. Nobody else nominated gets that much business to do onstage, though Laura Donnelly’s double act as mother and daughter in a part tailor-made for her was impressive, Sadie Sink made a striking TV-to-theater turn, and it’s great to see how much fun Mia Farrow is having .', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\nBrooks Ashmanskas — SMASH\nJeb Brown — Dead Outlaw\nDanny Burstein — Gypsy\nJak Malone — Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical\nTaylor Trensch — Floyd Collins', 'Jak Malone has become the focal point of the campaign for , a British comedy about a wild bit of World War II history. The show dominated the West End but has gotten a cooler reception here (Americans like to turn up their noses at humor from across the pond), though Malone delivers its standout number in the first act from the perspective of a stoic secretary, which feels like something voters will reward. Still, keep an eye out for Danny Burstein, who has won before and is as menschy as ever in Gypsy.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\nNatalie Venetia Belcon — Buena Vista Social Club\nJulia Knitel — Dead Outlaw\nGracie Lawrence — Just in Time\nJustina Machado —\nJoy Woods — Gypsy', 'Buena Vista is another show that popped up in a lot of categories but seems most likely to make headway for a featured performance. The musical based on the Cuban supergroup is getting a special Tony for its band, and it feels as though voters will also want to reward Natalie Venetia Belcon, who is imperial and striking as a diva who weathered the revolution and is pulled back into the recording studio (my God, her caftans!).', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play\nGlenn Davis — Purpose\nGabriel Ebert — John Proctor Is the Villain\nFrancis Jue — Yellow Face\nBob Odenkirk — Glengarry Glen Ross\nConrad Ricamora — Oh, Mary!', 'If we’re betting on Mary elsewhere, some of that shine must apply to her serious, very repressed husband, played by Conrad Ricamora, a Broadway vet who almost convinces you the show is a gay breakup drama. There’s also enthusiasm for Francis Jue, incredible as a version of playwright David Henry Hwang’s father (a part he has played before!). There’s also Glenn Davis, who multitasks by being in Purpose and co–artistic directing Steppenwolf, and Bob Odenkirk, though his production of was shafted elsewhere.', 'Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play\nTala Ashe — English\nJessica Hecht — Eureka Day\nMarjan Neshat — English\nFina Strazza — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKara Young — Purpose', 'How does Jessica Hecht not have a Tony? A stage regular with two previous nominations, she may finally get one for playing ’s crunchy-granola vaccine skeptic of a mother. But maybe I’ll regret betting against Kara Young, who plays an interloper in the family drama of and, after winning for Purlie last year, continues a streak of four Featured Actress nominations in a row.', 'Best Direction of a Musical\nSaheem Ali — Buena Vista Social Club\nMichael Arden — Maybe Happy Ending\nDavid Cromer — Dead Outlaw\nChristopher Gattelli — Death Becomes Her\nJamie Lloyd — Sunset Blvd.', 'It gets fun when the Revival and New Musical categories combine. Voters have to measure their enthusiasm for new work against their appreciation for what was renovated in older work. Or, simply: Do people like the screens in Maybe Happy Ending or Sunset Blvd. more? I’m guessing they go for Jamie Lloyd, who has become a marquee name with a distinctive-tats and star-forward approach (he’s doing a Bill & Ted next) and hasn’t yet won a Tony. But there could be more than enough love for Michael Arden, who has championed Maybe Happy and quickly become a Broadway regular (he’s got two shows next season), even if he .', 'Best Direction of a Play\nKnud Adams — English\nSam Mendes — The Hills of California\nSam Pinkleton — Oh, Mary!\nDanya Taymor — John Proctor Is the Villain\nKip Williams — The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Are we just putting all our chips on Oh, Mary!? I guess so. Phylicia Rashad, who directed its Best Play rival Purpose, wasn’t nominated in the Director category. Kip Williams’s work on Dorian Gray is striking, though it has its detractors — people love Sarah Snook but have mixed feelings about Williams’s social-media-infused take on Wilde. Danya Taymor, an expert in dramas about high-school drama, just won last year for , and Sam Mendes’s and Knud Adams’s shows have already closed. ’s outrageous farce runs with incredible precision, and that’s all Sam Pinkleton.', 'Best Book of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Ramirez\nDead Outlaw — Itamar Moses\nDeath Becomes Her — Marco Pennette\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts', 'It’s hard to tell if we’re in a year like 2017, when won basically everything, or a year like the last one, when voters went for more variety. (Then Suffs won for its book and score, while got the big prize). My feeling is this category and the one below will split. ’s jewel-box construction will put it over the edge here …', 'Best Original Score\nDead Outlaw — David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna\nDeath Becomes Her — Julia Mattison and Noel Carey\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson and Hue Park\nOperation Mincemeat: A New Musical — David Cumming, Felix Hagan, Natasha Hodgson, and Zoë Roberts\nReal Women Have Curves: The Musical — Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez', '… But Dead Outlaw’s garage-band rock may give it an edge as a score. (Never bet against David Yazbek.) My perspective is, yes, informed by listening on repeat to Thom Sesma’s hilarious solo from the perspective of a crooning coroner. And to do due diligence, maybe Tony voters have been inundated by so many clips of Death Becomes Her songs online they will be subliminally made to vote for it — but unlike me, I think they are blissfully unaware of TikTok.', 'Best Orchestrations\nJust in Time — Andrew Resnick and Michael Thurber\nMaybe Happy Ending — Will Aronson\nFloyd Collins — Bruce Coughlin\nBuena Vista Social Club — Marco Paguia\nSunset Blvd. — David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber', 'Okay, first of all, justice for the un-nominated orchestration. And second, what a wild group: Bobby Darin arrangements up against Collins’s bluegrass up against Maybe Happy Ending’s lovely chamber jazz up against Sir ALW’s face-lift on his own work. After a lot of listening, those MHE jazz arrangements stand out to me (such distinctive melodies in the strings!), but I could see enthusiasm for the neo-gothic or this being a place where voters want to further endorse the music of .', 'Best Choreography\nSMASH — Joshua Bergasse\nGypsy — Camille A. Brown\nDeath Becomes Her — Christopher Gattelli\nBoop! The Musical — Jerry Mitchell\nBuena Vista Social Club — Patricia Delgado and Justin Peck', 'Buena Vista may get another down-ballot win here given that as a choreographer (though known for ballet, he has won two Tonys already for Carousel and Illinoise) and there’s a fun narrative in . But hey, the kerfuffle over Boop! not to perform on live TV may mean the Tony could go to Boop!', 'Best Scenic Design in a Musical\nSwept Away — Rachel Hauck\nMaybe Happy Ending — Dane Laffrey and George Reeve\nBuena Vista Social Club — Arnulfo Maldonado\nDeath Becomes Her — Derek McLane\nJust in Time — Derek McLane', 'In Seoul, where the musical originated, was performed in a far more minimal way than its American incarnation, which incorporates elaborate design elements to bring two robots (and one ) to life. That feels eye-catching enough to bring it a win here, though voters might also have been dazzled by or Death Becomes Her’s tumble-ready staircase.', 'Best Costume Design in a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Dede Ayite\nBoop! The Musical — Gregg Barnes\nMaybe Happy Ending — Clint Ramos\nDeath Becomes Her — Paul Tazewell\nJust in Time — Catherine Zuber', 'Paul Tazewell, who just won an Oscar for costume design on the film adaptation of Wicked, is primed to get another Tony (after a win for design for Hamilton) for those striking Death Becomes Her gowns that . But I do love the lightly futuristic yet cozy aesthetics of Clint Ramos’s robotwear in Maybe Happy, which could continue a streak here, and voters may have Gregg Barnes’s designs for Boop!’s Act Two opener seared into their retinas.', 'Best Lighting Design in a Musical\nSunset Blvd. — Jack Knowles\nBuena Vista Social Club — Tyler Micoleau\nFloyd Collins — Scott Zielinski and Ruey Horng Sun\nMaybe Happy Ending — Ben Stanton\nDeath Becomes Her — Justin Townsend', 'In craft categories, there’s an incentive to vote for what you remember, and voters may just have a strong sense memory of being “” of Jack Knowles’s work on Sunset. They could also remember the trickery of the illusions in Death Becomes Her or the darkness of ’s cave or just continue along with love for Maybe Happy Ending (there’s a scene with fireflies that’s lit gorgeously).', 'Best Sound Design of a Musical\nBuena Vista Social Club — Jonathan Deans\nSunset Blvd. — Adam Fisher\nJust in Time — Peter Hylenski\nMaybe Happy Ending — Peter Hylenski\nFloyd Collins — Dan Moses Schreier', 'Sunset’s much-discussed Act Two opener sends Tom Francis , performing in sync with the orchestra. That’s the kind of attention grabber voters remember, even if I’ve heard some carping about the concert-level speaker-blowout design of Sunset.

The Musical\nFrancis Jue for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play in ', 'Jason P. Frank: I think Justina Machado should get this one because her nomination earned Real Women a Tonys performance.', 'Jackson McHenry: And she was in an early version of the play, so it’s cool that she’s coming back. It’s a good part. There’s a lot of mother-daughter tension because they’re basing it off the play, so they can’t change too much. I think a typical commercial musical would go for a happier ending.', 'Rebecca Alter: My vote is for Jasmine Amy Rogers. She carries . This was by far the most competitive category this year. Her getting in there against all odds as a newcomer is fabulous.', 'Death Becomes HerDead Outlaw, Michael Urie in Once Upon a MattressMaybe Happy Ending, and Alana Arenas in Purpose.', 'Jason Frank: I’m going to say Alana Arenas in Purpose. To me, it was a star-making turn. She just felt so embodied. I didn’t physically scooch forward in my seat to listen closer to someone at any other time this year. She is so remarkable, and she’s the only person from that cast who’s not nominated. I’m not going to name names, but she’s better than some people in that cast.', 'Rebecca: I’ll give my vote to Michael Urie in  because I thought that was genuinely such a weird interpretation of that type of character. It was a reminder that he should be a supporting actor in more things.', 'Jackson: I have to pull for Thom Sesma in Dead Outlaw. He’s really good and reserved for a lot of the show and then, at the 11th hour, he comes out and does the crooner number as a real guy — Dr. Thomas Noguchi, coroner to the stars — and bends the audience around his thumb. It’s fun to give him the big moment in that show, and I personally find the song incredibly delightful.', 'But we still love you, Helen J. Shen!', 'Vanya, The Picture of Dorian Gray,  Tammy Faye.', 'Jackson: Tammy Faye is just dumb. It has a weird level of sympathy for Tammy Faye Bakker but asks you to clap for Jerry Falwell. It also just doesn’t get how musicals work. It has no controlled perspective on its humor. It’s overblown and had a lot of screens. And Elton John wasn’t ever there.', 'Rebecca:', 'Dead OutlawDeath Becomes Her, The Corpse (Bill) in Operation MincemeatStranger Things, and the ghosts in Our Town.', 'Rebecca: It has to be Andrew Durand. I believed he was a corpse.', 'Jason: For the entire second half of the show, he doesn’t move. It’s the defining corpse of all time on Broadway.', 'Rebecca: They should put that on the marquee.', 'Boop! The MusicalRedwood; Hwaboon, the potted plant in Maybe Happy Ending; Caroline, the cow in Gypsy.', 'Jason: Stella is the only one a character falls in love with in the show. She is by far the most important to the plot of her respective show out of this crew. In fact, she is the entire reason Redwood exists — she is the titular redwood. I think the fact that Idina Menzel plays a lesbian and the tree is a woman means they really wanted you to know this was an erotic love. It’s the most grown-up of any of the options here, for sure.', 'Rebecca: I’m gonna stick with Hwaboom. Of these performances, its is the most inanimate and yet evocative. Hwaboon does very little and is a wholly embodied plant who also, frankly, should be nominated in the Best Tonys Campaigning category because this has become like a true mascot of Broadway. There needs to be a Sardi’s portrait of Hwaboon.', '', 'Jackson: It’s a tough call between those two. I’ll go with. I endorse California solidarity.', 'Just in Time, Dead Outlaw, and Ghosts.', 'Jason: Halfway through the reveal in Just in Time, a woman from New Jersey near me said “She’s his motha!” very loudly, and I enjoyed that. It’s a twist that provokes reaction.', 'Rebecca: When the reveal happened, Bobby Darin’s sister-mother was standing right next to us in the round — that gimmick goes a  way. You could see everyone’s reactions.', 'Honorable Mention: The Roommate', 'John Proctor Is the VilainMaybe Happy Ending ; and Daniel Dae Kim for Yellow Face.', 'Jason: For me, it’s Darren Criss because I don’t think  could necessarily exist on Broadway the way it does without the backing of a star. He’s kind of the only person who could do it. It feels really unique to his placement in the culture. You have to have someone who’s into musical theater. You want them to have some form of Asian ancestry. He’s so enthusiastic about the show that it really made it pop. And he has been willing to do it for a really long time, not just as a limited run; he’s in it for a full year.', 'Rebecca: And it’s such a physically demanding role. So my vote is also for Criss.', 'Jackson: I’d say Sadie Sink for getting John Proctor made. It’s a really impressive performance. I also think it’s impressive that she takes a role that’s a lead by a hair but really part of an ensemble. It’s good casting that she is this girl who’s coming back to school after a mysterious absence, so she’s famous within the universe of the show in a way that allows her familiarity with the audience to make sense. The play had been done regionally and in colleges, but to actually get the momentum over the line to a Broadway production, you’d need someone to commit to it. So it’s cool she did.', 'Maybe Happy Ending and Sunset Blvd.', 'Rebecca: I think the outdoor walk in Sunset Blvd. takes it. In the year of “Gotta Get a Gimmick,” this is the best gimmick I saw. The fact that, on most nights of the week, you can go to 44th Street and stand on the sidewalk at a distance and watch part of a Broadway number for free? Huge plus.', 'Jackson: And Sunset is about film. But it’s also like, please don’t do this again. This works now, but we don’t need more.', 'English, Dead Outlaw, and Maybe Happy Ending', 'Jason: I’d give it to English because it’s the only one that also functions as a sundial. It tells you what time it is by where the Sun is in the window.', 'Rebecca: I hate to say it — because I keep making it a  sweep — but those sets made my jaw drop. The way those cubes move around!', 'Jackson: The Dead Outlaw one is fun. It feels like you’re watching a garage band. I appreciate that the paintings on the wall make it look like you’re in an Elks lodge in Omaha.', 'Rebecca: And contained within that set is this extremely sexy guitarist in a vest.', 'Death Becomes HerOh, Mary!Oh, Mary!Sunset Blvd.Boop! The Musical; Darren Criss’s high-waisted pants in Maybe Happy EndingJust in Time.', 'Jason: Honestly, I’m going Jonathan Groff’s Speedo. It informed my perception of both the character and the actor — that’s impressive for one article of clothing. Jonathan Groff would like you to know how much he works out, and I learned that from the Speedo.', 'Rebecca: While I would have loved to give it to Speedo, unfortunately that led to a snub of Speedo’s castmate Fedora. Fedora is very important. But I’ll give it to the Oh, Mary! underpants because there’s only a flash of them. But the fact that they’re big white bloomers with cartoon red hearts — that’s the extra little detail that signals the exact sensibility that was put into this show.', 'Jackson: I’ll go with the wounds in the gowns in  because they’re just very fun. I appreciate that they continue to iterate on that bit whenever they do public appearances. I hope they show up to the Tonys in the same designs.', 'The road to a Tony takes place on- and offstage, and even Death Becomes HerSunset Blvd(unintentional); Jasmine Amy Rogers for Boop! The MusicalHannah Solow, also for Boop! The Musical.', 'Jason: For me, it’s Patti for Audra because it was unintentional. Patti for Nicole was an intentional thing where she wanted to say Nicole deserved to win, as opposed to  that had gotten maybe a little bored of awarding her, and she might actually win because of it. I think it is the most successful campaign.', 'Rebecca: I love that, but I want to go with . There were so many shows this year that tried to cater to hip young folks (Romeo + Juliet, John Proctor), and the one that managed to explode on TikTok is purely riding on the old-school camp star power of these two! How fun.', 'Jackson: I think Jasmine Amy Rogers’s “I’m just happy to be here” campaign is kind of impressive in that it’s just her being like, “Well, I’m Boop!” It’s almost not even a campaign as much as it’s “Oh shucks, what the hell!”', 'The LempickaLempicka', 'Rebecca: I’ve never seen a more Lempicka show than , and that includes Lempicka.', 'Here’s looking at you, James Scully as Mary’s teacher in Oh, Mary!The Picture of Dorian GrayStranger Things; Hagan Oliveras as Lee in John Proctor Is the Vilain; Kevin Csolak as Tulsa in Gypsy', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU1PV3BWZWkxUFkwRnlUV0pQVFJDcUJCaXFCQ2dLTWdhTk1JelZGQVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Our (Ill-Informed) Picks to Win the 2025 Tony Awards,https://www.jezebel.com/our-ill-informed-picks-to-win-the-2025-tony-awards,"['On June 8, the 78th Tony Awards will convene a who’s who of Broadway, from a certain red hat lover to the many who’ve been victimized by one Patti LuPone. Hosted by Elphaba herself, the show will return to its former home of Radio City Music Hall and feature a myriad of special performances—including one from the original cast of Hamilton. You know what this means? We’re back with our ill-informed predictions as to who will take home the gold!', 'Between revelations like Oh, Mary!, Purpose, and Just in Time, and revivals like Gypsy, Sunset Blvd., and Yellow Face, this season’s talent was dense and decorated. Personally, I’d like to see Cynthia Erivo pull a Cady Heron and give all the nominees a piece of the Tony, but alas.', '', 'Like last year, there are a couple of nominees that seem like locks, and I’ve labeled them as such. I also took the liberty of adding my personal picks, despite my ill-informed yet very critical mind, as well as the dark horse contenders. I use the “ill-informed” descriptor because I’m not a performer. In fact, I couldn’t even get a chorus role in any of my high school’s productions. So, I settled for doing makeup and talking shit about the talent backstage. That is, in essence, what I’m doing here. And remember, I don’t have the pocketbook to go to every show, but I did get to go to most of the top contenders. So, here we go!', 'The Nominees:', 'Bet on: Maybe Happy Ending. Since it opened in October 2024, it’s been lauded as “an unlikely hit,” “heart-grabbing,” and “poignant, powerful, and probably prophetic.” Who knew an AI love story would be so resonant in the year 2025?!', 'Would love to see it: Death Becomes Her. If you’ve seen the 1992 movie, the show isn’t much different, except for fewer special effects and one extra offensive fat suit (thanks to one of its stars’ advocacy). And if you haven’t, it follows a pair of frenemies who make a Faustian bargain for eternal beauty and youth, only to find that immortality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Since it opened in November 2024, the show has been lauded by critics as “dazzling,” “comedy gold,” and “to die for.” It should say enough that not only did the ensemble’s Tiny Desk performance go viral but that its two stars, the exceptional Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard, are nominated for Best Actress. While it’s not possible for both to win that category, it is in this one.', 'Dark Horse: Buena Vista Social Club. From the book to the performances to that get-up-out-of-your-seat music, it’s a deserving musical to be sure. If you get to go, you’ll probably count it as one of the most fun shows you’ve ever been to. The only flaw? Marc Platt produced it. Sorry! I’ll never look at him the same after I learned he flew across the country to scold Rachel Zegler about being anti-genocide.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'GET JEZEBEL RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Still here.

After several years of post-pandemic struggles, box office grosses set a new record this season, thanks to a flurry of hit new musicals like Death Becomes Her, Maybe Happy Ending, Buena Vista Social Club, and Dead Outlaw. Starry revivals of Gypsy (with Audra McDonald) and Sunset Boulevard (with Nicole Scherzinger) are also generating buzz. But it’s the non-musical plays with Hollywood headliners — like Good Night, and Good Luck (which will live-stream on CNN on June 7) with George Clooney, Glengarry Glen Ross with Bob Odenkirk, Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr, and Othello with Jake Gyllenhaal and Denzel Washington — that are pulling in the most eye-popping box office numbers (despite a lack of Tony Award nominations). ', 'Now, the best of Broadway will be celebrated at the 78th Annual Tony Awards, live from Radio City Music Hall, airing Sunday, June 8, hosted by Cynthia Erivo. A special live preshow, “The Tony Award: Act One” will be emceed by Darren Criss and Renée Elise Goldsberry and streams at 6:40/5:40c on Pluto TV.', 'So what else makes this year’s ceremony so worth watching?', 'Cynthia Erivo, who played Elphaba in the blockbuster Wicked film and leads the sequel Wicked: For Good, will be a first-time Tony Awards host. While she’s already a Tony winner for the 2015 to 2016 Color Purple revival and a three-time Oscar nominee (for Wicked and Harriet), Erivo doesn’t have much experience as a high-profile host and isn’t known for comedy. Yet producers are sure to lean on her booming pipes (and acting chops) in a show-stopping production number or two. How will she handle the in-between-segments banter as a first-time host? Considering her acting skills, we expect her to defy gravity (and maybe even best that epic Oscars moment?).', 'The A-list nominees already include Hollywood stars like George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Sarah Snook, Nicole Scherzinger, and Darren Criss, but there will also be a parade of bold-faced names presenting the awards. Among the headliners will be Hacks Emmy winner Jean Smart, who’s on Broadway in a new play Call Me Izzy; Bill and Ted themselves, Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, promoting their fall engagement of Waiting for Godot on Broadway; and Lea Michele and Aaron Tveit, who will headline an upcoming revival of the musical Chess.', 'Wicked star Kristin Chenoweth, who could be a Tony frontrunner next season for the new musical The Queen of Versailles, and Adam Lambert, who appeared on Broadway in Cabaret last fall, will also be presenters. Grey’s Anatomy vet LaTanya Richardson Jackson, who’s Tony-nominated this season for her role in the family drama Purpose, will likely present alongside her husband, Samuel L. Jackson.', 'Also appearing at the podium: Broadway veterans like Allison Janney, Ariana DeBose, Ben Stiller, Bryan Cranston, Danielle Brooks, Kelli O’Hara, Katie Holmes, Lea Salonga, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Michelle Williams, Rachel Bay Jones, Sara Bareilles, Sarah Paulson, and Oprah Winfrey herself.', 'Darren Criss in ‘Maybe Happy Someday’ / Cr. Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman from Polk & Co.', 'The most unique and exciting part of the Tonys is the electrifying live performances by the nominated musicals. The casts of the five Best Musical nominees — Buena Vista Social Club, Dead Outlaw, Maybe Happy Ending, Operation Mincemeat, and Death Becomes Her — will perform live. Musical numbers from the four Best Musical Revival nominees — Floyd Collins, Gypsy, Pirates! The Penzance Musical and Sunset Boulevard — will also be seen on the broadcast. In addition, Just in Time and Real Women Have Curves, musicals that didn’t get nominated in either of those categories but received key nominations elsewhere will also take the stage. (Just in Time is up for six Tonys, including Lead Actor in a Musical for Jonathan Groff; Real Women Have Curves is vying for two, including Featured Actress in a Musical for Justina Machado.) There’s also been a grassroots campaign to get Boop! The Musical a slot on the telecast after it was snubbed by producers, despite three Tony nominations including Lead Actress in a Musical for Jasmine Amy Rogers. Some fans are also up in arms that Smash, too, was passed over for a spot, despite two nominations.', 'You wanna be in the room (at least, near a TV) where it happens! To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s groundbreaking cultural sensation Hamilton bowing on Broadway, the show’s original cast will reunite for a special performance honoring that Tony award-winning landmark show. Among the actors participating will be creator and star Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr. (who will return to his Tony award-winning role as Aaron Burr in Hamilton in the fall), Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Daveed Diggs, Christopher Jackson, Ariana DeBose and Jonathan Groff. Will they perform the show’s title tune, “The Room Where It Happens,” “My Shot,” “Satisfied,” or a medley of several songs? What other surprises could be in store? Wait for it, wait for it!', 'There are two shows that were inspired by small-screen adventures being honored throughout the night as well. Smash, the musical loosely inspired by the loved-and-loathed 2012-13 television series, has been more of a bomb than a Bombshell, the fictional show-within-a show about Marilyn Monroe that Smash chronicles the making-of. It only scored two Tony nominations—Brooks Ashmanskas for Featured Actor in a Musical and Joshua Bergasse for Choreography. Ashmanskas recently won the Drama Desk award for his hilarious hurricane of a performance, but he’s in a close race with Jak Malone for his heartrending turn in Operation Mincemeat.', 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow, a visually spectacular origin story tied into the popular Netflix series’ mythology, scored five Tony nods, including for Louis McCartney for Lead Actor in a Play, thanks to his psychic breakdown as the tortured Henry Creel. Henry was Season 4’s main antagonist, Vecna, and First Shadow tells Henry’s backstory in 1959 before he was overtaken by demonic forces. The events of the play will become vital to Season 5’s storyline. So key details and information from the stage play will be threaded throughout the upcoming season. Stranger Things, a technological marvel that pulls off several eye-popping set pieces, could capture Tony wins in some categories like scenic design, costume design, lighting design, and sound design of a play.', 'This race for the night’s biggest prize is shaping up as a nail-biting face-off between Maybe Happy Ending, the ingenious robots-in-love fable, and the fantastically strange Dead Outlaw, a rollicking true story of a troubled man who became a failed bank and train robber but found infamy after death as a corpse in traveling sideshows. With magnetic performances from Darren Criss and Helen J. Shen, look for Maybe Happy Ending to outgun Outlaw for the night’s biggest prize. Still, two shows could spring an upset: The electrifying Buena Vista Social Club, inspired by the landmark album by a group of influential Cuban musicians and its subsequent Oscar-nominated documentary. Or the laugh-riot Death Becomes Her, based on the 1992 film and featuring a devastatingly sardonic script and some hilariously demented songs. In other words, this is not a foregone conclusion, and we’re itching to know what will happen.', 'The buoyantly bonkers Oh, Mary!, downtown theater maven Cole Escola’s fake-history play about an overdramatic, crackpot Mary Todd Lincoln as a wannabe cabaret star, has been the frontrunner all season. But two plays are gaining ground and could play spoiler: Purpose, a family drama about a Jesse Jackson-like civil rights trailblazer and his dysfunctional political clan; and John Proctor Is the Villain, headlined by Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink, about a group of high school girls grappling with feminism, gender power dynamics and the fallout of the #MeToo movement.', 'Audra McDonald in ‘Gypsy’ / Cr. Julieta Cervantes', 'This always-competitive category shapes up as a face-off between Broadway superstar Audra McDonald, the most decorated Tony Award winner and nominee of all time, for her emotionally wrenching reinvention of the steamrolling Momma Rose in Gypsy, and former Pussycat Doll and The X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger for her equally earth-shaking portrayal of silent film icon-turned-deranged dragon-lady Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. Scherzinger not only acts to the audience but some of her performance is recorded by onstage camera crews and projected onto a 23-foot-tall screen. While Scherzinger scored the Olivier Award in 2024 when the production originated in London, McDonald just won the Drama Desk award and has already amassed six Tonys in her storied career. Expect a photo finish. Their musicals, Gypsy and Sunset Boulevard, are also the leading contenders for Best Musical Revival.', 'Jonathan Groff, Darren Criss, and Jeremy Jordan all have extensive theater pedigrees but the trio are also well-known for their television work. Groff had a leading role on Netflix’s FBI profiler series Mindhunter and in the tenderhearted gay drama Looking. Jordan was a leading man on Supergirl and had his breakthrough in NBC’s Smash, while Criss is an Emmy winner for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story and also starred on Glee. For this year’s Tonys, Groff is nominated for playing crooner Bobby Darin in the bio-musical Just in Time. Jordan, who was on Broadway last season in Gatsby, plays a fearless cave explorer who gets trapped underground in Floyd Collins. Criss plays a robot who falls in love with the android across the hall in Maybe Happy Ending. Groff won this award a year ago for Merrily We Roll Along, so look for Criss to triumph for his uncanny physical and emotional transformation in Maybe Happy Ending.', 'A Hollywood luminary for decades, Clooney is now nominated for Best Lead Actor in a Play for her performance as legendary newscaster Edward R. Murrow in Good Night, and Good Luck, the blockbuster stage adaptation of his Oscar-nominated 2005 film. Despite charming Broadway, he’s probably in third place in this race. The favorite? Cole Escola for the writer and deadpan actor’s hilariously anti-historical comedy Oh Mary!, in which they play a demented version of Mary Todd Lincoln. Still, beloved Hawaii Five-0 and Lost star Daniel Dae Kim could spring the upset for his performance as a self-deluding playwright in the revival of David Henry Hwang’s Yellow Face, a funny and timely exploration of the complexities of identity politics, now available to stream on PBS’s Great Performances).', 'Snook, who won the Emmy in 2023 for Succession, is the leading contender for Best Lead Actress in a Play. She’s nominated for her tour-de-force turn playing more than two dozen characters in the technically audacious adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. Snook performs directly to the audience at times, but mostly to camera crews that follow her around the stage. The images are projected onto several moving LCD screens with Snook also acting alongside herself as pre-recorded versions of some characters. It’s an astonishing feat. She may be squaring off against celebrated actresses like Mia Farrow, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, and Laura Donnelly, along with Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink for her fiery John Proctor Is the Villain role, but the Succession star is a sure thing to pocket this prize.', 'Sarah Snook in ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ / Cr. Marc Brenner', 'Death Becomes Her tied with Maybe Happy Ending and Buena Vista Social Club for the most Tony nominations this season, 10 for each show, but there’s a real chance it could come up empty at the awards. Could it pull off an upset for Best Actress? That’s unlikely, with dual nominees Megan Hilty and Jennifer Simard likely canceling each other out. It’s a strong contender for Best Book and Best Score, but could lose out to Maybe Happy Ending or Dead Outlaw in those contests. The show’s brightest prospects may lie in the technical categories, for Paul Tazewell’s eye-popping costumes or Derek McLane’s inventive scenic design. Hopefully, the gut-busting (literally!) Death can rise from the ashes to Tonys immortality!', 'Two exceedingly likable performers—Groff, who’s nominated for Just in Time and won last year for Merrily We Roll Along, and Kara Young, who’s nominated for Featured Actress in a Play for Purpose and won last year for Purlie Victorious—could join an esteemed list of only six performers to win two Tony awards in a row (Laurie Metcalf, Judith Light, Stephen Spinella, Sandy Dennis, Gwen Verdon, and Shirley Booth were the previous). Young has already blazed a trail to become only the second performer to be nominated for four Tony Awards in succession and would become the first person of color to win two Tonys consecutively. Groff would become the first actor to win back-to-back Lead Actor in a Musical prizes. Daniel Dae Kim could become the first Asian winner for Leading Actor in a Play. Then there’s Audra McDonald, already the most decorated Tony Award winner in history, who could add a seventh Tony to the unprecedented six trophies she’s already collected.', 'Finally: When Sunset Boulevard premiered on Broadway in 1994, it walked off with seven Tony Awards the following spring, including Best Musical. But the show’s legendary composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who once dominated Broadway with long-running warhorse musicals like The Phantom of the Opera, Cats, and Evita, hasn’t won a Tony Award for Best Musical or Best Musical Revival in the three decades since then.

"Tony Talk: Our final winner predictions in all 26 categories, including competitive Best Actress in a Musical and Best Play Revival",https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/tony-talk-final-winner-predictions-2025/,"['Welcome to Tony Talk, a column in which Gold Derby contributors Sam Eckmann and David Buchanan offer Tony Awards analysis. In the final week of the 2024-2025 Broadway season, we debate our winner predictions for the biggest prizes and in the most hotly contested categories for one last time. The Tony Awards air Sunday on CBS and Paramount+.', ""David Buchanan: We are now just days away from the Tony Awards, so it's time for us to offer our (nearly) final predictions! For such an incredible season on Broadway, it seems like a lot of the top categories have coalesced around one contender. I think we're both in agreement that Maybe Happy Ending is far and away the favorite for Best Musical. I know there has been growing support for Death Becomes Her in the past two weeks, but not enough to displace those beloved Helperbots, right?"", '', '', ""Sam Eckmann: Yes, I'm feeling super confident about Maybe Happy Ending taking Best Musical. Death Becomes Her has become a popular alternate, but with no actual guaranteed wins, it isn't favored enough to overcome the androids in one of the biggest Broadway success stories of the season. Speaking of unlikely successes, I'm also certain that Cole Escola's radically queer camp-fest Oh, Mary! will take Best Play. It's one of the strongest lineups we've ever seen in this category, but that's also why it's so hard for anything to surpass Mary Todd Lincoln here: voters are in love with them all and not coalescing around a single alternative. Do you think the revival races are as clear cut?"", '', '', ""Buchanan: I agree on Oh, Mary! for Best Play. There are two potential challengers — Purpose and John Proctor Is the Villain — and if voters go somewhere else, I think it would be for Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, who has been doing a lot of press in support of his Pulitzer Prize winner. But a zeitgeist-capturing show like Oh, Mary! is hard to beat. The revival races are a bit murkier. Of the two categories, I'm more confident in Best Musical Revival, where I have Sunset Boulevard out front. I've made this comparison before, but this year strikes me as similar to the Oklahoma! versus Kiss Me, Kate contest in 2019, where the more divisive, riskier production pulled off a victory over a more straightforward, conventional staging. Did Gypsy's win at the Drama Desk Awards change your prediction?"", '', '', ""Eckmann: I've spoken with voters who have returned for a second viewing of Gypsy this spring and found that many elements of the production have clicked into place in a way that they said didn't happen in the fall. So the show is experiencing an upswing. Still, I think George C. Wolfe's omission in the directing category plants Gypsy firmly in second place to Sunset Boulevard. Even those who aren't enamored with Jamie Lloyd's directorial concept say they respect the uniqueness of the show. The closer race is Eureka Day vs. Yellow Face for Best Play Revival. David Henry Hwang and company have certainly run the larger awards campaign, with countless voter screenings of the PBS video capture of Yellow Face. And yet, Eureka Day claimed the Drama League, Drama Desk, and Dorian Awards when both plays went head-to-head. It's likely due to the timeliness of its vaccine-mandate storyline as measles cases pop up across the country. I'm still going with Yellow Face, but I think this will be one of the closest races of the night."", 'Buchanan: I am similarly sticking with Yellow Face, though the awards run for Eureka Day has been impressive. Manhattan Theatre Club very astutely released video of the 16-minute Zoom scene from the latter production for voters to consider, and that is truly a standout moment of the Broadway season which could help the show pull off a victory. This is the one of the four production categories that I will be rethinking and updating until Tony night.', ""But there is no greater contest or closer race this year than Best Actress in a Musical. You and I have been firmly predicting Gypsy's Audra McDonald for the entire season, and the six-time Tony winner has been on an upswing with other theater awards, winning the Drama Desk and the Dorian Award. But for the first time since the Tony nominations, Sunset Boulevard's Nicole Scherzinger has taken the lead in Gold Derby's combined odds and has that coveted Drama League Award win. Plus, there's Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk victor Jasmine Amy Rogers from Boop! The Musical ready to surprise like some other newcomers in recent years. As I've expressed in earlier columns, McDonald's performance is far and away my favorite of the Broadway season and has emotionally walloped me all three times I've seen her, so I am not wavering in my prediction that she wins a historic seventh trophy. What is your final proclamation on this contest?"", '', '', 'Eckmann: Scherzinger had a slight edge in this battle after she won the Drama League, but the winds have shifted. The recent controversy stirred up by Patti LuPone, in which she spoke disparagingly about Kecia Lewis and McDonald, has earned the Gypsy star palpable good will in the theater community. That doesn’t mean this is a done deal for McDonald, however, as there is a massive surge for Rogers as Betty Boop. There are definitely voters hesitant to give McDonald a seventh trophy and are instead being won over by the “star is born” narrative for Rogers. McDonald won the Dorian Award, Rogers won the Outer Critics Circle Award, and they both shared a win at the Drama Desks. All three actresses enter this final week with serious hardware in tow. I personally think our odds are off and Rogers has surpassed Scherzinger for second place behind McDonald. I’m still betting on this six-time winner to break her own Tony record, but it remains a nail-biter. Shall we move to Best Actor in a Musical, where I think the race has settled to a more manageable two-person heat?', ""Buchanan: I am predicting Darren Criss, as he is the face of Maybe Happy Ending and the musical should likely perform exceptionally well on Tony night. But I don't think this is a slam-dunk victory just yet. The contest could likely come down to his equal-parts technically precise and heartwarming performance versus the charismatic burst of energy from Jonathan Groff in Just in Time. I know historically there has never been a lead actor to win two consecutive trophies in this category, but I don't think Tony voters really know or care about those statistics like we do, and there's almost nobody as beloved or endearing as Groff in the industry right now. Just In Time also did well with nominations overall, and this could be the opportunity to reward it. Are those the two men you had in mind? I'd also flag Tom Francis of Sunset Boulevard, who is campaigning just as vociferously as the others, has the standout performance of the title song in Shubert Alley, and could possibly upset if his show exceeds our expectations."", '', '', 'Eckmann: Francis and Jeremy Jordan (Floyd Collins) both have ardent supporters, but I think the focus has narrowed to Criss and Groff. Regarding the stat about back-to-back victories, there has hardly been any meaningful opportunities in Tony history for consecutive winners in this category. So it’s a non-factor, really. Groff has the showier role and could absolutely win. But, I’m betting Criss takes it (by only a hair) because of the overall popularity of Maybe Happy Ending, and because his performance tugs at the heart more than any of his fellow nominees.', ""Buchanan: In contrast to these lead musical races, the contests for Best Actress in a Play and Best Actor in a Play appear pretty sewn up for Sarah Snook (The Picture of Dorian Gray) and Cole Escola (Oh, Mary!), don't they? There are other performers in these two categories who would make extremely deserving winners, but I'm not sensing any major changes in sentiment that would lead me to actually predict an upset."", '', '', ""Eckmann: Agreed on Escola and Snook. Though I will fangirl over Laura Donnelly in The Hills of California until the day I die. At least she got a Drama Desk win! Upsets are more likely elsewhere. Featured Actor in a Play has become a true coin toss between Conrad Ricamora of Oh, Mary! and Francis Jue of Yellow Face. I was previously thinking Jue, but have switched to Ricamora since he is in the more favored show, but I don't feel confident in it. Featured Actress in a Play remains a wild ride. The fact that presumed frontrunner Jessica Hecht wasn't even nominated at the Drama Desk, Drama League, or Outer Critics Circle for her amazing role in Eureka Day gives me pause. So I still have a crazy hunch that Dorian-winner Fina Strazza is going to pull off the biggest upset of the night as a way to reward John Proctor is the Villain. We all need one gutsy prediction right?"", ""Buchanan: My thinking in the featured races may evolve depending on where I land in Best Play Revival. Yellow Face doesn't need an acting win to pull off a victory, but if it does prevail, then I think Jue likely goes along for the ride for what I consider the best performance in that production. I'm tempted to go along with you and predict Strazza, but at this point in the Tony countdown, I'm going to stick with my instinct and predict Kara Young from Purpose to repeat. My belief in her was buoyed by her win at the Drama Desk Awards, not because these voting bodies have a lot of overlap, but because it is clear she continues to be cherished throughout the industry, and that sentiment sometimes propels you to consecutive prizes at the Tonys just as Judith Light and Laurie Metcalf experienced not so long ago. Fortunately, the Featured Actor in a Musical and Featured Actress in a Musical contests seem much steadier, as we're both still hanging onto Jak Malone from Operation Mincemeat and Natalie Venetia Belcon for Buena Vista Social Club. "", ""Let's pivot to some other confounding categories that we haven't discussed before! You and I both made a pretty big switch this week in Best Director of a Musical when we bumped Jamie Lloyd out of our first spot in favor of Michael Arden for Maybe Happy Ending. Are you getting a sense like I am that even if Sunset wins Best Revival, the production might be too different and too divisive to carry visionary Lloyd across the finish line, whereas few will quibble with Arden's work on the Best Musical frontrunner?"", '', '', 'SEE Tony Talk: Predicting the tricky musical acting categories including Audra McDonald vs. Nicole Scherzinger', ""Eckmann: As recently as one week ago I would have told you that Lloyd had director in the bag for Sunset Blvd. But Arden has completely overtaken the conversation this past week. Voters have been enamored with his pitch-perfect work in Maybe Happy Ending all season, but were hesitant to reward him so soon after his Parade victory two years ago. If you talk to any voters now though, they clearly overcame their hesitation. Arden has been a constant presence on the awards circuit and successfully snatched the momentum. He's won the Drama League, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards. I’d actually be shocked if anyone else took the Tony at this point. I also feel fairly confident that Sam Pinkleton will take Best Director of a Play for Oh, Mary! Danya Taymor will put up one hell of a fight for John Proctor Is the Villain, and would be the rare person to win consecutive trophies after her victory for The Outsiders last year. But voters have gotten the message that Pinkleton's work is just as essential to Oh, Mary! as Escola's script."", '', '', 'Buchanan: Since we now both predict Maybe Happy Ending to nab Directing, will it sweep and pick up wins for Best Original Score and Best Musical Book? Our current odds have it running the table and a lot of experts agree, but in such an exceptionally strong year for original musicals, I\'m keenly looking out for a surprise. I surmise we\'re diverging on these categories significantly because I\'m going against the grain on score and predicting Dead Outlaw. David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna have written the ear-worm of the season with ""Dead"" and delivered a true genre-spanning, Americana, rollicking collection of songs that infuse a lot of grit and heart into the true story of Elmer McCurdy. I also think folks underestimate how well-respected Yazbek is in the industry, and this is far and away his strongest offering since The Band\'s Visit, if not one of the best of his career. Our odds once had Pulitzer finalist Itamar Moses winning for Dead Outlaw\'s book but have recently switched to Maybe Happy Ending, and I made the move with them. Are we 0-for-2 matching each other\'s predictions here?', ""Eckmann: I understand your point about Yazbek, but I don't think everyone is unanimously in love with Dead Outlaw. I feel overly confident that Will Aronson and Hue Park have Score in the bag for their tuneful music in Maybe Happy Ending, which will pair well with its Best Musical win. Best Book of a Musical feels more rife for an upset. Moses brought the most unique concept to life, so he is certainly in the hunt. Comedic books can also land here, as was the case for Tootsie and Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder. So this could be a place where voters throw a bone to Death Becomes Her and Marco Pennette's hysterical reinvigoration of the classic movie. I'm waffling between the funny bone of Death Becomes Her and the bleeding heart of Maybe Happy Ending, likely choosing the latter. Speaking of waffling, can we dish on the design categories? Sunset Boulevard appears to be the likely winner for both Musical Lighting Design and Musical Sound Design, and Dane Laffrey will surely win Musical Scenic Design. But I can't seem to choose between Death Becomes Her or Boop! The Musical for costumes. Boop! has the potential to spoil the race in all three of its nominations! Where are you leaning?"", 'SEE Tony Talk: Sarah Snook and Cole Escola remain strong in lead, but upsets loom in the featured play races', '', '', 'Buchanan: That is an extraordinarily tough contest for Musical Costume Design between Gregg Barnes for Boop! and Paul Tazewell for Death Becomes Her! Both would make for deserving winners and Tazewell has had an extraordinary year with his historic Academy Award win for Wicked, but I have landed on Boop! for the upset win. My decision is mostly derived from the utterly brilliant work he did on the Act Two opener, ""Where Is Betty?,"" in which the entire ensemble wears half black-and-white and half technicolor costumes and alternatively turn 180 degrees to instantaneously transport the audience between Betty\'s cartoon world and New York City. It is the kind of old-school theatrical design sleight of hand that screams to be recognized. Despite the cleverness of that number and of the Boop! opening, ""A Little Versatility,"" where we see Betty perform in different short films, I\'m going with Buena Vista Social Club for Best Choreography. Justin Peck has been irresistible to Tony voters thus far and the work he and his wife Patricia Delgado did bringing these iconic Cuban songs to life on stage is pulse-pounding. Speaking of that indelible music, we\'re both aligned on it taking the prize for Best Orchestrations, too.', ""For the four play design categories, it looks like the technical marvel Stranger Things: The First Shadow will very likely gobble up three for Play Scenic Design, Play Lighting Design, and Play Sound Design, but how about that tricky Play Costume Design category? Will Mary Todd Lincoln's hoop skirts or Sarah Snook's two dozen different looks prevail?"", 'Eckmann: Stranger Things should indeed prevail in three of its four categories thanks to its monstrously impressive stagecraft. But the costume design race is a different story. Our odds favor Oh, Mary! and it certainly helps that the show is a wildly popular Best Play nominee. But I believe The Picture of Dorian Gray costumer Marg Horwell will handily buck our odds and place a Tony on her shelf next to the Olivier she won for the same show. Her outfits, and their ability to rapidly transform in front of the audience, are an essential piece of Sarah Snook’s 26-character magic trick. Now let’s see how smart, or foolish, we look when the winners are unveiled this Sunday.', 'SIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions', 'Your email address will not be published.
