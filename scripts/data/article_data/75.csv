The highly contagious respiratory illness causes heavy bouts of coughing that can lead to vomiting or broken ribs and can be life-threatening to susceptible populations, like those under a year old.', 'There have been 11,720 cases of whooping cough in 2025, as of the week ending on May 24. This comes after whooping cough rates soared to surpass pre-pandemic levels last year.', 'An expert told The New York Times that the rise of whooping cough is a combination of falling childhood vaccination rates and lack of exposure to the disease during the pandemic. Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, which can cause the airways to swell.', 'The disease is a vaccine-preventable illness, but CDC data show that whooping cough immunization rates for children have fallen in recent years, according to a Times analysis.', 'The CDC recommends a whooping cough vaccination for everyone, especially for babies younger than 1 year old who have a heightened risk for severe complications. Ten people died from whooping cough in 2024, most of them being less than a year old.', 'The first round of vaccination is typically given during childhood to ward against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria, according to the CDC. A booster shot to protect adults against pertussis and tetanus is recommended about every 10 years.', 'Experts also recommend that pregnant women receive the vaccine to pass on immunity to their newborn.', 'The rise in whooping cough cases comes as vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the U.S. Health and Human Services Department under Trump. Kennedy is known for his controversial stances on vaccines and has claimed, without reputable evidence, that the vaccines cause autism.', 'Health experts warned that cases of vaccine-preventable illnesses could go up with Kennedy leading the nation’s top health department. There have also been measles outbreaks along with whooping cough outbreaks across the country as childhood vaccination rates drop.', 'This comes as Kennedy has repeatedly cast doubts on vaccines, highlighted in his “Make America Healthy Again” report that experts say was created with false or misleading citations.', 'Increased scrutiny of childhood vaccines — credited with saving millions of people from deadly diseases — figures prominently in the report. It poses questions over the necessity of school mandates that require children to get vaccinated for admittance and suggestions that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos.', 'Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has raised doubts about the safety of shots even as a measles outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 Americans. Last week, Kennedy’s health department moved to limit U.S. access to COVID-19 shots.', 'The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Our journalism needs your support.

This statistic is a 6.5% decline from a 79% vaccine DTaP rate from 2014.', 'Pertussis is a contagious disease of the respiratory tract and can be spread from person to person by coughing or sneezing, the DHD4 states. Touching contaminated objects can also spread the disease. DHD4 explains that pertussis can cause a severe cough that lasts for weeks or months. Infants often get pertussis from older siblings or adults, and the disease can be fatal for babies and people with weakened immune systems.', 'According to the press release, early symptoms of pertussis can mimic a common cold, and sometimes take 5 to 10 days for symptoms to appear after exposure. Babies and young children with pertussis may not cough, but may have pauses in their breathing (i.e. apnea), which can make their skin look blue or cause shortness of breath. Later symptoms may include uncontrolled coughing fits and vomiting.', '“If you or your child has symptoms of whooping cough, isolate the infected person and seek medical treatment, especially if there are signs of respiratory distress,” Kelly Girard, DHD4 nursing director, said in the press release. “If caught early, treatment can reduce the risk of serious illness and possibly prevent it from being passed on to others.”', 'The DHD4 states that the best protection against pertussis is to get vaccinated. According to the DHD4, vaccination also works to build “herd-immunity,” helping protect those who cannot receive the vaccination due to age or other conditions.', 'The press release states that doctors recommend the vaccine be given to children at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months old, and an additional booster at 4 to 6 years old.
