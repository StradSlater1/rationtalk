This is why what’s on your plate has become the need of the hour. The complex ecosystem of bacteria in your gut helps with nutrient absorption and overall digestive efficiency. Probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are hot topics when it comes to digestive wellness. Many even opt for their supplements, but before that, let’s understand each of their roles in maintaining gut balance.', 'In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Anukalp Prakash, Director of Gastroenterology at CK Birla, Gurugram, shared how probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics all aid in maintaining good gut health, and whether one needs to use supplements for all three.', 'He said, “Over the past few years, the word ‘biotics’ has been the buzzword of digestive wellness. Patients frequently inquire what probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are, and whether they should have all three in their diet. Allow me to break it down so you can know the differences, their health benefits, and when exactly they might actually be necessary.” ', 'Now, how do you know which is most important? Probiotics often steal the spotlight, but there are other team players that equally support gut health. And do you really need all the supplements?', 'Dr Anukalp Prakash further clarified, ""Though each of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics has a specific role to play in maintaining gut health, it\'s worth noting that not everybody requires all three in supplement form. The supplement market is still largely unregulated, so select quality products that have clinical backing, and consult a healthcare professional if you do not feel well. In the end, consider these ‘biotics’ an A-team: prebiotics feed, probiotics colonise, and postbiotics work. A solid, fibre-based diet, coupled with individualised medical advice, is still the best method to ensure a healthy, resilient gut.""', 'The gastroenterologist shared a detailed guide with us, breaking down the essentials of all three biotics- probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics: ', '', '', ' ', '', 'Examples of sources:', '1.

"Your gut doesn’t need probiotic supplements, here’s what nutritionist recommends instead",https://www.financialexpress.com/life/lifestyle-your-gut-doesnt-need-probiotic-supplements-heres-what-nutritionist-recommends-instead-3873520/,"['', '', 'In recent years, probiotics have become one of the most talked-about health trends—often found in capsules, powders, or even gummies claiming to “boost gut health” and “improve immunity.” But do you really need probiotic supplements? Or can you get the same benefits from your daily diet? To get clarity on this, we got in touch with Dr. Karuna Chaturvedi, Head – Clinical Nutrition at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida, and she says that the answer depends on your health condition.', '“Probiotic supplements contain live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your body. They support the body’s defence system and help strengthen immunity, especially by maintaining gut health,” says Dr. Chaturvedi.', 'Probiotics are live microorganisms—usually bacteria or yeast—that naturally live in your body, especially in your digestive tract. The most common strains found in supplements are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These “good bacteria” play a major role in digestion, nutrient absorption, and fighting off harmful microbes.', '“Oral probiotics help restore the balance of healthy gut bacteria,” Dr. Chaturvedi explains. “This not only aids digestion but also helps the body absorb nutrients and eliminate harmful germs.”', 'Probiotic supplements are often prescribed to people dealing with gut-related issues like bloating, and diarrhoea, or after a course of antibiotics, which can kill both harmful and helpful bacteria in the gut.', '', 'While probiotics are generally safe, Dr. Chaturvedi says they’re not necessary for everyone. “If you’re healthy and your digestive system is working fine, there’s usually no need to take a supplement,” she advises. “A balanced diet with fermented foods can give you all the probiotics you need,” she further said.', 'Some people may experience side effects from supplements—such as bloating, mild digestive discomfort, or even negative interactions with medications, especially antibiotics. That’s why it’s always best to consult a doctor or dietitian before starting them.', 'Absolutely! In fact, Dr. Chaturvedi recommends choosing natural food sources of probiotics over pills.', '“Foods like yoghurt, buttermilk, cottage cheese, and pickles naturally contain beneficial bacteria,” she says. “These offer the same gut-friendly benefits without the risks that sometimes come with supplements.”', 'Other fermented foods like idli, dosa batter, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha can also support gut health when consumed regularly.', 'While probiotic supplements can help in certain situations, they aren’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The best approach? Focus on eating a variety of nutritious foods, staying hydrated, and managing stress—because a healthy lifestyle supports a healthy gut.', '“Supplements can be helpful for people with specific health issues, but for most of us, a natural diet is enough,” Dr. Chaturvedi explains. “Your body has its own way of maintaining gut health—just give it the right fuel.”', 'Probiotics are powerful, but they’re not magic pills. Unless you have gut issues or your doctor recommends it, your kitchen already holds the best solution for good gut health.', '', '', 'Global uncertainty and geopolitical tension have caused investors to be cautious in the mutual fund industry.

Popular Science: Will Prebiotics and Probiotics Really Help You Poop?
