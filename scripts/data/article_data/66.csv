Why Screen Limits Matter for Parents Too,https://www.parents.com/why-screen-limits-matter-for-parents-too-11744333,"['PARENTS/ GETTY IMAGES', 'Let’s face it—screens are everywhere. They\'re on computers, on phones, on tablets and almost everywhere we look. Kids learn by watching, and when adults are constantly glued to their devices, it sends a powerful message about what\'s ""normal.""', ""Modeling healthy screen habits is a balancing act, but experts say it’s possible to find a happy medium. This means setting limits the same way you would in other areas of your life, and carving out time that's completely screen-free."", ""Here's why experts say limiting screen time is important for parents, plus practical ways to get started."", 'Before setting screen time rules with your kids, it’s important to reflect on your own screen time habits. Experts say there are a few key reasons why parents should take an active role in managing their own device use:', '“Kids have an amazing ability to call us out when we are not engaged and in the moment,” says Matthew Solit, MSA, LMS and executive clinical director at Lifestance Health. “They are also quick to point out the hypocrisy of us telling them to put their devices down and proceeding to pick our own.” ', ""Children often mimic what they see. If they see us tuned out on our phones, they learn to do the same. As parents, it's critical to model the kind of behavior that encourages connection, attention and presence—both now and as they grow."", 'Constant notifications, mindlessly scrolling, and answering emails and texts can condition the brain to seek frequent stimulation and even cause psychological distress.\n1\nOver time, this digital overload may lead to restlessness, mental fatigue, and difficulty concentrating, even during moments that require your undivided attention. Just like children, adults are not immune to these cognitive effects. Managing screen use is essential for maintaining mental clarity and focus.', 'Being present—putting down your device and engaging in meaningful activities like playing family games, cooking dinner, going for walks, or simply talking—builds esteem and social skills in children. “It’s also better for our own wellness,” Solit adds.', 'You may not think you’re doing too much damage to your eyes with all that screen time, but too much can lead to digital eye strain.', '“Excessive screen time is defined usually as greater than seven hours a day, but even as little as two hours a day of screen time, if left untreated, can cause health issues,” says James Kelly, ophthalmologist and founder of Kelly Vision.', 'Kelly recommends the 20/20/20 vision break rule, along with frequent blinking: “This basically means taking a visual break every 20 minutes, where the individual looks at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds,” he explains.', 'Parents should keep a few things in mind when trying to limit screen time, explains  Robert D. Friedberg, PhD, clinical psychologist and faculty member at Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy.', ""“If your child is spending an excessive amount of time on screens, it is obviously reinforcing,” he says. “There are two kinds of reinforcement: positive reinforcement which is generally associated with approach behavior and negative reinforcement which is linked to avoidance and escape behavior. Positive reinforcement produced by screen time is marked by both pleasant emotions as well as physiological 'highs' associated with activations in neural rewards systems in the brain.”"", 'Start by having a honest conversation—first with yourself and then your kids—about the pros and cons of screen time. Getting their collaboration and agreement makes the process easier.', ""Children who are spending a lot of time on screens may not “want” to limit their use. “I recommend replacing the word 'want' with 'willing.' (e.g. 'How willing are you to decrease screen time?'). It creates a somewhat different lens from which they can see the issue,” says Friedberg."", 'Set limits slowly but consistently so kids can respond to the change rather than reacting to it.', 'Once willingness is established, come up with a list of enjoyable alternatives together. For younger kids, try creating an activity grab bag where they pull a card with a fun, screen-free activity they commit to completing.', 'Solit says that managing your own screen time is another great place to begin. He suggests planning ahead and finding activities that work for you and your family. ', '“It helps to find things that are interesting to both you and your kids, otherwise the temptation to pick up that phone becomes greater,” says Solit. “Set limits slowly but consistently so kids can respond to the change rather than reacting to it. It’s like getting into running, you don’t want to start with a marathon, just a light jog and build your way up.” ', ""Also, talk openly with your kids about why you're making the change. It will really help them to understand and become invested in changing their habits. Remember, it's not about cutting screens entirely—it's about moderation."", 'Friedberg says making sure everyone in your home or in your kids day-to-day routines are on the same page is crucial.', '“Disclosing personal views about screen use and collaboratively sharing educational information about the effects of screen use is key,” he says. “Additionally, making sure all involved have direct knowledge of contingencies and rewards for managing screen use facilitates consistency.”', 'It also helps to set good boundaries and talk about ways to hold each other accountable. It’s important that other family members are on the same page with clear separations between screen time and family time. Changing the home culture around sc can be challenging, but it is certainly worth it for everyone.', ""There are general guidelines for screen time—like the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation of no more than one hour per day of quality content for younger kids, and two hours for older kids.\n2\nBut these limits can certainly vary by family and situation."", ""“If the screen time has a noticeable negative impact on social, emotional, or academic functioning, it’s likely too much,” says Solit. “It's important to watch the impact of any media on your kids, positive and negative.”"", 'If your own screen habits are causing anxiety, depression, or difficulty connecting with others, it may be time to seek help from a qualified mental health professional.', 'Solit recommends starting small and tracking what works by keeping a notebook where the whole family can write down activity ideas, then mark the ones that worked well. Again, make sure the activity is engaging for everyone because if one person disengages, it is hard for others to stay engaged. Even the simple act of participating together in cooking, gardening, chores, walks, and other simple activities together goes a long way with connecting and finding a healthy screen time balance.', '“It is understandable that parents sometimes need a break to tune-out, but it helps to synchronize your screen time with your kids to protect and preserve dedicated family time,” says Solit.', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNTVUMVI1TlVkck1qRTBTMFowVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtZElZb0tzdVkxNUFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

 Q&A: Your child’s brain on screens,https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2025/06/09/q-a-your-childs-brain-on-screens,"['', 'One thing I often wonder when I see my kids spend time watching videos on their tablets or online gaming on their consoles is what is it doing to their young brains? Who better to talk this over with than an actual brain surgeon.', 'Dr. Alexander Khalessi is chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery at UC San Diego School of Medicine and neurosurgeon at UC San Diego Health. He also is the President of Congress of Neurological Surgeons.', 'This interview has been edited for clarity.', 'What should we be thinking about in terms of brain and our media use?', ""Khalessi: Wilder Penfield called the brain the organ of destiny. I think quite simply, it's the part of the body that makes us us. It's the seat of consciousness. It's a very complex organ that is defined by a series of networks that connect populations of neurons. It's also obviously responsible through the use of master hormones for regulating all of the key functions of our body and how we actually interact with the environment."", ""In childhood and adolescence, the brain is very much a moving target. It's developing rapidly in a way that subserves a lot of our other development. And like any organ that's growing and changing and developing those networks, it's quite sensitive to environmental stimuli."", ""And so if you think about the competing networks in the brain in very simple terms, I always tend to think of it as a dynamic tension between a positive and negative conversation. In other words, there's a signal and there's noise. And so there's things that want to reinforce and improve your performance over time. And there are those things that are distractors or negative behaviors that you actually want to be able to gain mastery of with executive function and suppress over time."", 'And so the extent to which children are subjected to persistent repetitive stimuli that, by definition, is going to have some impact on how their brains develop.', ""Can you talk about our understanding of the brain and how that's changed in recent years in terms of how it works and how that plays a role in kids and technologies?"", ""Khalessi: I think real advances in our understanding of neuroscience really have benefited from advances in other areas. Because the brain is such a complex organ, it's really been recently that we have the material science and the computational power to decode some of these networks."", ""And so there's really outstanding, sophisticated imaging now that is mapping what we call the connectome. So we're actually understanding how different parts of the brain talks to one another. And actually that really supports our subjective experience. Things like mood, how we learn, understanding the biology of sleep. All of those things are actually growing quite a bit."", ""In addition to that, we're getting much better temper spatial resolution of signals in the brain. So if you think about the organ of the brain as a musical instrument, the electrical activity of the brain is the music. And so we're getting much better at actually hearing the music. And so it used to be that in patients with seizure disorders, you had a 64-line EEG that was a crude summation of a lot of different interaction in the brain. And we're able to deconstruct that much, much more now."", 'The implications for childhood development, understanding that story a little bit better, are the same. That is, if you actually are monitoring the activity in the brain and you expose people to different stimuli, you can actually understand over time how that stimuli is impacting on those networks. Networks being done in, for example, soldiers who actually have repeated and persistent concussions or athletes.', ""We're learning a lot about the functional networks of the brain by starting with more severe environmental exposures like blast or head injuries. But absolutely, there's a lot of interest in moving towards things like hyperactivity, screen time, and those sorts of other conditions that are top of mind for many parents raising their children."", ""On screen time and kids, I hear a lot about cortisol and the way that that plays a role. Can you explain what that is and is that actually a key component to understanding what's happening when, say, a child is playing a video game?"", ""Khalessi: There's two ways that the brain fundamentally exerts an influence on our bodies. One is through direct neuronal connections in that electrical activity of the brain. The other is through control of master hormones. And so cortisol is one of the fundamental stress hormones, and it has a lot of positive functions."", ""When you're trying to mount any response, a fight or flight response, let's say, or when you're out practicing a sport, cortisol is your friend. It raises your blood pressure. It actually improves blood flow at your muscles. It actually allows you to ramp up and perform."", ""A persistent chronic stress response has some negative effects over time because it actually depletes your body's reserve. You can't be running a dead sprint all the time. And if you have chronic release of cortisol from your brain because your brain is fooled into believing you're in a threatening situation, that actually has some long term downside. It can lead to sleep disruption, issues with attention. It can lead to, obviously, disturbances of mood."", ""To the extent to which, and obviously, video games today become quite sophisticated, children are immersed in a video game world, the extent to which it's realistic and provides a more entertaining video game experience that also, quite understandably, will elicit a response. Your kid's palm will start sweating if they're in an anxious situation. If you do that hours on end, it stands to reason that's going to have an impact on your health that's a little different than if you're outside playing or participating in sports."", ""You talked about you can't be in that “deep sprint” all the time. I think a lot of parents have had this experience where trying to transition your child outside of a screen. In this case, my son was playing a video game and was really into it and started getting a little irritable. Then it was trying to get them off, (giving them a) five minute warning thing. But it's almost like they're really dialed in, and it's really hard to transition out of that. Can you explain just from a scientific perspective what's happening in those instances in the brain?"", ""Khalessi: In broad terms, what you're describing is the transition from a preferred to a non-preferred activity. There's two components of that. The first is by design, if we're talking about a video game specifically, those games are designed to actually maintain engagement. If you say to your child, five more minutes, that five minutes will seem arbitrary because it will feel to the child that there's a task that's still unfinished."", ""It's very similar for adults when if you've ever watched these streaming services like Netflix, the reason people end up binging entire seasons is the close of an episode doesn't actually feel like there's closure. And by design, it's set up in a way to actually maintain your interest and want you to actually persist. And so it's not shocking that less mature brains have that same response to technology that's designed precisely for that purpose."", ""But there's a double hit there. The first hit is you're actually taking your child away from a desired environmental stimuli. But the second piece is as your child is more chronically exposed to screen time, they lose the reserve for those non-preferred tasks. And so if you think about it as a tension between the risk-reward system of their brain, the limbic system of their brain, where they're actually getting, for the lack of a term, the hit of this preferred when you withdraw that hit, and at the same time, you haven't built sufficient discipline or executive function or all those other things to then transition, let's say, to a focused task like doing homework or even sitting in a restaurant without an ongoing stimulus, that patience and discipline is something that really just needs to be developed."", ""It can actually only be developed by periods of uninterrupted time. If I actually said the thing that I'm personally most worried about, in terms of the impacts of these screens, it's actually less they want to continue to engage in things like games. It's more the loss of that ability to be patient, reflective, imaginative, generative in those moments where they're actually not exposed. You're getting it on both ends."", ""How does the brain work at these younger ages in terms of building that patience? I'm thinking like, Hey, I've already set these … I already, frankly, have let my kids maybe have more screen time than I would have in retrospect. But here I am, right? How could I be thinking about trying to build patience?."", 'Khalessi: I tend to think, not being a child psychologist or a child development specialist, I, in general terms, as someone who interfaces with the brain in a clinical way, think about child development in terms of seasons.', ""So you have ages zero to five, where a lot of massive brain development is taking place. And a lot of what you're trying to do there is the child to develop a sense of self and a foundation for interacting with their peers. Then, from five to 12 in that structured environment is really where you actually start to develop social norms and a response more to actually third-party authority as opposed to parental authority."", ""I have young children myself, and I can tell you they're more responsive sometimes to their teachers than they are to your parents because your parents are a source of familiar security. And so they actually start to learn some of those social structured norms."", ""Then there's this period of early adolescence, from 12 to 15, where there are these massive surges in hormones, where there's actually that gap between executive frontal function and the limbic system gets a little bit wider. And so that's a period of a lot of emotion and potential regression in that balance between executive function and in impulse control."", ""And then from about 15 to about 25, that's typically where you really start to see the full maturation of the frontal and temporal lobes in a way that really subverts what we consider modern adult executive function. In big building block chunks, that's generally the biology of what the substrate we're working with. Then within, obviously, each of those areas, there's lots of things you can do to put your child in a position to be successful."", ""Are there any potential brain benefits to some of these newer technologies? I know there's all these brain games that I've heard"", ""Khalessi: There's a whole cottage industry, as you mentioned, around maintaining neurocognitive abilities, I would definitely say there's no question that there's actually a lot of good psychosocial data that those structured tasks are beneficial, both in terms of mood and purpose. It goes back to the original framing I offered in terms of the positive and negative conversations in your brain. So And in the same way, just to be clear, not all screen time is equivalent. If you use screens, that's why screens are sometimes being introduced into our public schools. If you use that technology in a way that allows for problem solving of the assignment of collaborative tasks, all of those things are skills that can actually build that reserve, delayed gratification that can build that reserve on the positive side that we're talking about in terms of that generative capability in the absence of stimuli. I don't want us to live in a world where you say these things clearly have a negative impact, and If we believe they can have an impact, it stands to reason it can be for either positive or negative applications. For the positive applications, though, I do think it's important to actually look at data."", ""If you look at a bunch of different word games, understanding the actual cognitive task you're trying to master and how that's actually furthering your cognitive profile, that's something that can be measured. You'd actually want to measure those things and use validated instruments."", 'Is there anything that a parent should know or keep in mind when thinking about brain health and their children?', ""Khalessi: As a first step, I think that it's really helpful to start with the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics in terms of absolute amount of screen time at different ages. Then, as I said, I would actually try to make sure the things your children are exposed to, that they're exposed with intent. Moderating the content, you have visibility to it."", ""If you have them on an iPad, you're using apps that allow you to quite clearly review what they've actually seen. You don't want them to have open-ended, for example, internet connections, particularly in earlier stages in life, because there's a lot of other implications that come with that just beyond screen time. Then if you're thinking about more positive tasks, like some of the different games that we were talking about, I would actually think about, and there's lots of reviews on this topic and validated metrics around that, start to think about, Okay, what am I actually trying to achieve with this time?"", ""I'll confess to you, and I understand it, that in an era where kids require persistent input guidance and stimuli, often, screen time is used as a de facto day care solution. And so to the extent possible in everyone's busy lives, I would resist that urge and make sure that that time is productive time for your kids. And then also, the last thing I'd say is that the brain, particularly young brains, need cognitive rest. And so if I ask you to run a marathon on a Friday and then run another marathon on a Sunday, and then I add a marathon on Saturday, that's not the same thing. The marginal impact is a lot more than just one additional marathon. And so it's really important to actually have regular intervals of breaks, particularly punctuated by outdoor activity."", ""The other key thing, which we haven't talked about, which is one of the most dramatic impacts of a prolonged screen time in young people is a sleep disruption. And so thinking about when you're actually exposing people to screen time, meaning your children to screen time with respect to their desired fixed set bedtime, is quite important in making sure there's some good spacing there. If you don't believe that, if you are in a situation where you're already committed, your child's already had long intervals of screen time, I'd encourage parents to just pay attention to like, Hey, when I actually let my child spend four hours on the screen within two hours of bedtime, how'd they sleep that night?"", ""I promise you you're going to see a difference in their sleep quality."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNTVUMVI1TlVkck1qRTBTMFowVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtZElZb0tzdVkxNUFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

Instead of saying screens are just good or bad, the research showed a more complex picture of how digital devices are changing childhood."", 'For the study, the researchers looked at 117 studies from different countries, tracking kids for several months to several years. They looked at how much time kids spent on screens and any issues they had, such as anxiety, aggression, depression, or trouble paying attention.', 'By following the same children over time, the researchers could see whether screen use came before emotional problems or the other way around. They noted that the effects were small but consistent.', 'One of the biggest concerns found during the study was video games. Kids who played video games were more likely to develop emotional and behavior problems later. Even more concerning was that kids who already had those problems were especially drawn to gaming.', '""High screen use isn\'t just a cause of problems — sometimes, it\'s a symptom,"" said lead author Roberta Pires Vasconcellos to CNN.', '""In many cases, children who are already struggling emotionally turn to screens, especially video games, as a way to cope or escape,"" added Vasconcellos. ""While that might offer short-term relief, over time it can trap them in a cycle that reinforces those emotional difficulties.""', '', '', 'Gaming also had a stronger link to emotional issues than other screen uses, like watching TV. It became the top choice for kids who were already struggling and looking for comfort.', 'The study also found difference of screentime impact between boys and girls. Girls were more affected by general screen time, while older boys were more likely to have problems linked to heavy gaming.', 'Interestingly, older kids aged 6-10 were more at risk from screen time than younger ones aged 0-5 as they have more freedom to choose how they use screens and often turn to them to escape emotional stress.', '""Instead of developing self-regulation skills, they come to rely on screens for comfort and distraction,"" Vasconcellos noted. ""This can reinforce a harmful cycle where emotional difficulties are masked rather than addressed, making it even harder for children to cope without a screen over time.""', ""The researchers also pointed out that not all screen time is harmful. For example, watching educational content with a parent usually doesn't cause problems. The real issue starts when screens are used to replace emotional support, physical activity and real-world interaction."", '""If you notice your child turning to screens more often when they\'re upset or withdrawn, it might be time to check in on how they\'re doing emotionally,"" Vasconcellos advised. ""In some cases, they might be seeking the sense of connection or support they\'re not finding in their face-to-face relationships — at home, at school or in other social settings.""', 'For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com', 'Health News', 'Privates Laptop Screens Bulletin boards ideas Youtube Videos Videos Children', 'June 06, 2025 14:30 ET\nSurvey data and official reports on manufacturing and the labor market were among the main news from the U.S. economy this week.

The Digital Reset That Kids (and Parents) Need Right Now,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-anti-doomer-mindset/202506/the-digital-reset-that-kids-and-parents-need-right-now,"['', '', 'Posted June 3, 2025 | Reviewed by Monica Vilhauer Ph.D.', 'Despite the numerous studies pointing to how screen time negatively affects youth mental health, American children still spend an average of 7.5 hours a day on devices. One reason for this is that busy or stressed-out parents are eager to buy time for themselves to work, run errands, clean the home, and just vegetate at the end of a long day. But what if all of this screen time actually complicates parenting in the end?', 'As a child therapist and mother of two elementary school-aged kids, I frequently speak with parents about their decisions around the use of smart watches and phones, iPads, video games, and other forms of digital technology. What strikes me again and again is how frequently parents walk into the technology trap with the best intentions and wind up with serious regrets. They are left scratching their head and saying things like: ""Hmmm....maybe we should have waited,"" ""I wish I\'d set some more ground rules,"" and ""I just didn\'t realize that it was going to go this far."" Too many parents are falling into the trap of too much, too soon, too fast. And, they are discovering that it\'s a swamp to get out of once immersed!', ""By now, many of us have heard the chorus of warnings about the dangers of digital technology from child development experts, social scientists, psychologists, and our former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. We know and understand that screen exposure can harm kids' development by interfering with children's abilities to focus at school, delaying language acquisition, disrupting social relationships, increasing isolation, decreasing empathy, increasing violent behavior, exposing them to cyberbullying, contributing to low self-esteem, and increasing anxiety and depression. We’ve even seen the statistics: Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, illustrates how children's mental health plummeted in the period between 2010-2015, just as smartphone use soared."", ""And yet, many parents are loath to believe that technology use by children is a serious problem. You have to wonder whether there's insidious techno-optimist denial, conscious or unconscious, when it comes to establishing health and safety protocols for young people and technology. Or, if we’re so afraid of (or embroiled in) our own compulsive screen use that we’re reluctant to deal with the issue when we see it in our children."", ""Why the pushback and ambivalence? Why do so many of us just let our kids’ screen dependence happen? Because we've sleepwalked our way into a screen-saturated status quo on the heels of the pandemic. Think about it: Devices are convenient parenting tools. Whether you're sitting in a waiting room, flying on a plane, or wanting to catch a few more winks of sleep on a weekend morning, screens offer a release valve for desperate parents. They sedate kids as effectively as drugs—and that's not just a coincidence, since both trigger reward pathways in the brain."", ""But what works in the short term for parenting may not work in the long term. Technology use spawns other issues that require parental oversight. The video game an older child is playing at home might be too violent for a younger sibling. The smart watch or phone used for keeping in touch during the day may open up a world of group chats that turn cruel. A seemingly harmless video game might lead a young child into the shadows of an online gaming community. YouTube channels can lead to early exposure to sex, drugs, and violence. Social media platforms may prey on a child's vulnerable self-esteem and desire for acceptance. And so on."", 'In the end, managing devices becomes yet another responsibility for time-strapped parents. Between that reality and the well-documented mental health impacts of screen use on kids, the question arises: Is it really worth it to give our children devices early on?', 'I, for one, am skeptical. What I do know is that parents ought to feel empowered enough to pause for careful consideration before buying a device. Some questions to consider are:', 'There\'s often pressure to give in to whiny or persistent kids\' demands. It can be difficult to say no to our kids when there\'s a critical mass of children their age with a particular device. Sometimes there\'s even a domino effect at schools where after one kid in a class gets a device, the rest follow. Remember, it\'s a parent\'s job to deliver a gentle but firm ""no"" from time to time and uphold boundaries that align with their values.', 'In a recent podcast, Haidt lamented the erosion of a ""moral framework"" in modern American parenting. He calls attention to our collective reticence to offer up moral judgments about what\'s right or wrong, healthy or unhealthy. Perhaps the pandemic’s reliance upon screens has made it difficult for parents to course-correct. The fact remains, however, that parents are long overdue for a digital reset in accordance with their deepest morals and values. By having conversations early on about how they plan to navigate the screen scene, creating a timeline and eventually a contract for digital technology, delaying social media until age 16, modeling healthy boundaries with their own devices, and sharing consequences in advance if rules are broken, parents can help themselves—and each other. Furthermore, they can have honest conversations with kids about why they are delaying buying a device or imposing limits on screen use at home. Kids may not agree, but they will appreciate the honesty, and they will likely understand that limits are a form of love—even if they won\'t admit it.', 'In my forthcoming book, Raising Anti-Doomers: How to Bring Up Resilient Kids Through Climate Change and Tumultuous Times, I make a case for the power of parent support groups to help us navigate all sorts of modern issues—screen use included. I believe that the secret weapon in all of this technological mayhem is parents and our potential to come together and support each other in the absence of federal or state regulations on digital technology. The Wait Until 8th movement is a nice example of this — a pledge that parents make kids wait until after 8th grade to buy a smart phone for their child. (When a critical mass of parents sign the pledge at a school, then that school joins the official broadcasted list). Parents can hop on the bandwagon of delaying devices just as easily as hopping onto the bandwagon of allowing them. Upholding boundaries is easier when other parents are doing the same. Community is the vital resource that parents need right now to lessen their loads.', ""Perhaps the wisest place to begin is at your child's school. After all, this is where they interact with countless peers for hours on end each day, sharing and comparing all aspects of their lives from sneakers to sports to screentime rules. Attending PTA meetings, and banding together with interested or like-minded parents to compare digital concerns, hatch digital boundaries, plan educational nights with speakers, book clubs, and documentaries, or work towards instituting a stronger school policy around devices is fertile ground for sure. A group of committed, motivated parents is surely a force to be reckoned with; it will back-you-up in your parenting, but most importantly — it will uplift you in the years ahead."", 'Ariella Cook-Shonkoff, MFT, is a licensed psychotherapist and registered art therapist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.', 'Get the help you need from a therapist near you–a FREE service from Psychology Today.', 'Psychology Today © 2025 Sussex Publishers, LLC', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNTVUMVI1TlVkck1qRTBTMFowVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdtZElZb0tzdVkxNUFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

The truth about kids and screentime: are yours getting too much?,https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/children-screentime-advice-guidance-tips-gn3zqd7f2,"['Now showing content from the last twelve months, not just the past six days.', 'Challenge yourself with today’s puzzles.', 'Crossword', 'Polygon', 'Sudoku', 'P\neppa Pig has become a household name, not least because the sassy cartoon character is a go-to distraction tool for busy parents and their angsty kids. But are we relying too much on Peppa and other equally popular programmes aimed at children? (See: Ms Rachel, the dungaree-clad American who has found herself at the helm of educational YouTube content for toddlers.)', 'Last month Helen Hayes MP, chair of the education committee, said that the government should act “on the mass of strong correlatory evidence between screen time and harm. “Further delay will be to the continued detriment of children’s mental health, development and education,” she added.', 'Sophie David, an educational consultant and former early years teacher, agrees that children across the UK are spending far too much time on screens — and not enough time learning in creative ways. “As a whole, our education system doesn’t have a good stance on play at all,” says David, who has written a book called Read, Write, Play to promote what she calls “real-world learning”.', '• Read more parenting advice, interviews, real-life stories and opinion', 'David, 33, has three children, aged eight, six and four, and refuses to let any of them do their homework on a screen. “I’d say that 90 per cent of my children’s homework set by their teachers is on a screen,” she says. “As soon as my children start a new year group, I have an open discussion with the teacher and I say, please let me know if you feel that my child is falling behind, but they will not be doing homework on apps. We’ll be doing it in a physical and fun way.”', 'The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that children under two should not spend any time on screens, while those aged between two and four should spend no more than one hour a day looking at a screen. “The reason for these guidelines is because toddlers’ brains grow at a rapid rate. By the time they are three, their brain is about 80 to 90 per cent of its adult size, which is insane,” David says.', 'Does David have a totally screen-free home? No. She has a TV and a Nintendo Switch, but implementing clear boundaries is key. “My kids don’t have the TV after dinner. They only get to watch it for half an hour to an hour at a time. We don’t have tablets. We do have a Switch for our eldest son, and he can only go on that for half an hour.” She’s adamant that rather than demonising screens altogether, we should focus on the quality of the screen time that we’re exposing our children to.', '“With my preschooler I’ll only watch TV programmes that are slow paced — meaning the narration is intentionally slower in tempo and delivery. There should also be fewer rapid scene changes and pause time built in. Finally, no flashing lights or bright colours that can overstimulate her.” David is therefore a big fan of the animated TV series Bluey, which she says has “minimal stimulation” and offers educational benefits, including promoting play-based learning and problem-solving.', 'She also likes Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood, another animated series, which follows four-year-old Daniel Tiger. Researchers at Texas Tech University found that children who watched the programme had higher levels of empathy, were better at recognising emotions, and were more confident in social situations than kids who watched a nature documentary. The YouTube channel Cosmic Kids Yoga is another firm favourite in the David household because it aims to make movement and mindfulness fun.', '• TikTok, Snapchat and screen time: a parent’s guide to children and phones', 'How about the immensely popular Peppa? “In general Peppa Pig has short simple story lines and covers some social interactions such as welcoming a new sibling. However, some of the language and behaviours portrayed by Peppa at times can be a little whiny, bossy and impatient which can be a negative for toddlers as they like to imitate behaviours they see.”', 'David is similarly against any apps such as Spelling Shed, that position themselves as “educational”. She believes that they are designed to create a dopamine hit by activating reward pathways (via specific sounds and images) in a child’s brain. As well as wanting to promote a playful approach to learning rooted in the real world, she’s concerned that virtual learning can lead to unnecessary competition. “There’s leaderboards involved on many of these apps and children are able to access that,” she says, adding that being at the top feeds egotism. “Equally, I also don’t want my children to feel inadequate at the bottom. I want them to play. I want them to enjoy learning. And when learning is done in this way, you’re raising cortisol levels and creating stress — that’s never going to make them enjoy it.”', 'She says that instead of using Spelling Shed, find innovative ways to make spelling words more engaging. “The app goes back to the old way of writing out a word over and over again — it’s just on a screen.” If homework is set via the app, David looks at the list of words that her child needs to spell. “We have foam letters and they write out spellings onto foam sheets. We also use paint sticks, bath crayons and coloured shaving foam to write on the side of the bath or in the shower. Part of the fun is cleaning it off afterwards with a squeegee or sponge, which are both great for their fine motor skills.”', '• Cutting your child’s screen time: what helps and what doesn’t', 'And rather than learning times tables on an app with her six-year-old son, she uses fidget spinners that are times tables based. She also plays games such as getting her son to throw a ball into various plastic cups and each cup has a different times table question inside it. When it comes to her four-year-old she makes use of something as basic as Play-Doh. “People just think it’s something for kids to squidge, but it helps to build fine motor skills as well. So it contributes to a child being able to hold a pencil,” she says.', 'To parents who feel they simply don’t have time to plan activities around learning, or clean up a messy environment, David says: it’s easier than you think. “You can work it into your day, even if it is just half an hour. It can be as simple as playing Uno, and that just involves a pack of cards.”', 'Read, Write, Play by Sophie David is published on June 5 (Robinson £22)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.

"Screen time is both a cause and symptom of kids’ bad behavior, according to new research",https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/screen-time-kids-emotional-problems-alaimo-wellness,"['Editor’s note: Kara Alaimo is an associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Her book “Over the Influence: Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls — And How We Can Take It Back” was published in 2024 by Alcove Press. Follow her on Instagram, Facebook and Bluesky.', 'Does your child not listen to you? Do they kick and scream when they get angry? You may need to rethink their screen time, according to an article published Monday in Psychological Bulletin, a journal of the American Psychological Association.', 'The more time kids spent looking at a screen, the more likely their actions and feelings didn’t meet expectations for their stage of development, according to a meta-analysis of 117 studies of kids younger than 10½ when the research began.', 'These socioemotional problems included anxiety, depression, hyperactivity and aggression. The association was small but significant, especially for girls.', 'The studies were designed in different ways but the overall picture showed that trouble occurred when kids under age 2 had any screen time (other than video chats), when kids ages 2-5 had more than an hour per day of screen time and when older kids had more than 2 hours per day of screen time.', 'Kids who spent a lot of time on games were particularly at risk. And 6-to-10-year-olds were more likely to develop socioemotional problems than children age 5 or younger.', 'What’s more, kids who experienced these challenges tended to turn to screens even more to cope, which could exacerbate the problem. This was especially the case for boys.', 'Sometimes as a parent, you just have to be tough and put your phone down', '“High screen use isn’t just a cause of problems — sometimes, it’s a symptom,” said lead author Roberta \ufeffPires Vasconcellos via email , noting one of the most striking findings.', '“In many cases, children who are already struggling emotionally turn to screens, especially video games, as a way to cope or escape,” said Vasconcellos , who is a\ufeffn associate lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “While that might offer short-term relief, over time it can trap them in a cycle that reinforces those emotional difficulties.”', 'One of the largest of its kind, the meta-analysis has limitations, however, because it couldn’t account for factors such as parenting style or socioeconomic status, Vasconcellos said. And since the studies looked at screen time more broadly, they couldn’t pinpoint the effects of social media use on kids’ mental health.', 'Nevertheless, this latest data on kids and screen time suggests specific actions parents or guardians can take to have a real, positive impact on their kids’ mental health.', 'Adults often give kids screens to help them calm down, especially during work time or in other situations when children need to be quiet, such as at a restaurant.', '“While this may offer short-term relief, it can lead to longer-term problems,” Vasconcellos warned. That’s because it may prevent kids from learning how to behave appropriately and handle their emotions.', '“Instead of developing self-regulation skills, they come to rely on screens for comfort and distraction,” she said. “This can reinforce a harmful cycle where emotional difficulties are masked rather than addressed, making it even harder for children to cope without a screen over time.”', 'One change I made to my social media use made a big difference on my mood', 'Look for signs that children are reaching for screens when they have a problem. Rather than assuming the problem is the screen itself, look at the bigger picture, Vasconcellos said.', '“\ufeffIf you notice your child turning to screens more often when they’re upset or withdrawn, it might be time to check in on how they’re doing emotionally,” she advised. “In some cases, they might be seeking the sense of connection or support they’re not finding in their face-to-face relationships — at home, at school or in other social settings.”', 'That’s when they need parental support and guidance the most — “to help them feel heard, understood and emotionally safe, both online and offline,” Vasconcellos said.', 'School guidance counselors or therapists are also good sources of support.', 'The amount of time kids spend gaming is also important to note, according to the study.', '“\ufeffOnline games, in particular, pose additional risks because they often function like social media platforms,” Vasconcellos said. “Since these games continue even when a player logs out, children may feel pressure to stay connected for longer periods, which can lead them to neglect important real-life activities like sleep, schoolwork and face-to-face interactions.', '“For this reason, gaming may require extra attention and clearer boundaries — especially for older children, who are typically granted more independence in how they use their time.”', 'It’s important to set rules for kids’ screen time and stick to them. “Keeping rules consistent helps children know what to expect and makes limits easier to follow,” Vasconcellos said.', 'Parental controls on phones and apps are also useful. “Most devices offer built-in tools to help you manage screen time and filter content,” she said. “Use these settings to set reasonable daily limits and ensure your child is only accessing age-appropriate material.”', 'To help prevent kids from depending too much on devices, Vasconcellos suggests removing apps such as video streaming platforms that are particularly tempting. Instead, give kids content that is educational or that serves a good purpose.', 'The results of this study didn’t surprise me. In my research, therapists and teachers often complain that parents or guardians aren’t willing to set limits and say no when their kids ask for screens.', 'When I say no to my own kids, their reactions aren’t always pleasant. I have to remind myself that, as their mom, it’s my job to know what’s best for them and to make decisions that will keep them healthy in the long run — even if it leads to short-term distress for us all.', 'Limiting kids’ phone use is also wise. A newly published consensus statement I coauthored with experts around the globe offers evidence that heavy use of social media and smartphones by young people is linked to problems with sleep, attention, addiction and body dissatisfaction.', 'Parents’ phone habits increase exposure of mature content for children, new study finds', 'When I speak to parents about how to handle their kids’ social media use, they often tell me they feel they need to give their younger kids a phone at the same age their older siblings got one. That’s not true.', 'Tell younger kids who make this argument that you are more experienced now and have more data showing how screen time can be harmful.', 'Also consider attractive alternatives to a phone. One mom told me she offered her daughter $1,600 to wait until she was 16 to get a phone. Her daughter took the cash. While many people don’t have that kind of disposable income, you can still be creative and propose other things that kids would like. Sleepovers with friends, or a family camping adventure are just some examples.', 'No matter what you offer, it’s important to rethink the way you let your kids use technology. Since screen time may be both a cause and a symptom of behavioral and emotional problems in children, get comfortable saying no. It may provoke kicking and screaming in the moment, but it will likely lead to better mental health in the long run.', 'Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

Experts say the effects aren’t just developmental—they may be emotional, behavioral and lasting.', 'Here’s a breakdown of the findings and what parents need to know.', 'Guidelines from both the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend zero screen time for children under 1, and no more than one hour per day for those aged 2 to 5. But recent studies show many families aren’t following that advice.', 'In low-income communities, the rates are even higher. A 2015 study published in Pediatrics found 92% of children from these communities started using mobile media before their first birthday. By age 2 to 4, nearly half of American kids have their own tablet or smartphone. That figure jumps to more than two-thirds by age 8.', 'Experts say excessive screen time may do more than distract—it can harm. A new study from the American Psychological Association found that children under 10 who spend more time on screens are more likely to experience depression, anxiety and behavioral challenges.', 'And the relationship is cyclical. Researchers say those same emotional struggles may drive children to spend even more time on screens to cope, reinforcing the problem.', 'The study included all types of screen use—TVs, tablets and smartphones—but found no significant preference in content among kids. It wasn’t what they watched or played, but how long they engaged with it that mattered most.', 'While screen use affects children across the board, researchers found gender differences in how those effects play out. Girls, especially those using social media, were more susceptible to emotional harm. But boys showed stronger links between general screen use and negative outcomes over time.', 'Experts say boys tend to struggle more with impulse control, frustration and emotional regulation—factors that may influence how they use screen time to cope.', 'One study found boys are up to six times more likely to engage in problematic gaming, which may crowd out protective behaviors like physical activity, friendships and school engagement.', 'Among the different types of screen use, gaming appears to have the strongest “reciprocal relationship” with socioemotional problems. In other words, kids who game more often tend to experience more emotional difficulties, which in turn leads to more gaming.', 'Researchers caution that this doesn’t mean all gaming is harmful. Some video games can improve well-being, social connection, or even cognitive skills. But when gaming becomes a way to escape emotional distress or replaces healthy behaviors, it can become problematic.', 'Experts emphasize that screens aren’t inherently harmful, but they should be used thoughtfully.

(Quelle surprise.)', 'Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s landmark book, The Anxious Generation, published last year, gathered together a compelling range of studies linking the rise of smartphone use and social media with a spike in anxiety and depression in young people. Meanwhile, groundbreaking Netflix drama Adolescence shone a light on the potentially devastating effects of teens spending huge swathes of time online consuming harmful content.', 'But while much of the conversation and handwringing has zoned in on kids’ behaviour, there’s been very little airtime given to adults’ problematic dependence on devices. Now, a group of schools in southeast London are finally bringing the grown-ups into the chat. A consortium of 21 nurseries, schools and colleges in Southwark has banded together to collectively urge parents to limit not just their children’s screen time at home, but their own screen time too, reports The Times. Sent out to the families of more than 11,000 students on Monday (9 June), the letter encouraged adults to “minimise their own screen use when in front of children”, adding that teachers would also be adopting better behaviour, and laying out guidelines for different age groups.', 'Suggested daily screen time limits ranged from five minutes for infants up to 18 months to five hours for year 10 and 11 students aged 14-16 years old (though it’s surely a mark of how dystopian current culture has become that five hours constitutes “cutting back”?). While the educators dishing out the advice stressed this was “not an attack on modern parenting”, they explained that the move was in response to some troubling observations: namely, children at nurseries developing worrying attachments to screens and pupils starting school with speech and language issues, plus emotional needs “that are likely to have been exaggerated by or are even directly attributable to excessive screen time”.', 'As Joanne Hawthorne, of St Anthony’s Catholic Primary School, said of the new campaign: “A sad observation is that children on buses, in buggies and in cars are given devices rather than toys.” We’ve all seen it happen, and nothing could be more understandable – harangued, overworked parents pacifying a screaming toddler by shoving a tablet into their hands, or capitulating to the demand for “just one more” episode of Gabby’s Dollhouse in exchange for five minutes of blessed peace in which to hang out the washing, get dinner on or file an overdue tax return.', 'But what’s more alarming still is seeing adults around children doing the scrolling themselves, lost to a never-ending digital world – so that kids’ overwhelming experience of their caregivers is one of half-present distraction. Attention is a constant battleground, one in which phones and laptops frequently emerge as the victor. It’s sad yet telling that Southwark parents are being encouraged to “be present and engaged when they drop off and pick up their child rather than being on a phone”, according to Hawthorne.', 'The issue runs deep, and it is adults, not children, who are at the heart of it. “From early on in development, children spontaneously imitate the complex actions of others, a capacity that increases steadily with age,” according to one paper published in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology. Youngsters will imitate behaviours they see, even if these serve no obvious function – a phenomenon known as “over-imitation”. Think about it: babies don’t pop out of the womb desperate to get their chubby little hands on a touch-screen. They learn their behaviours from us – they want to be on devices the whole time because, well, the grown-ups they’re unconsciously mimicking are on devices the whole time.', 'It’s why parenting experts and educational psychologists bang on about the importance of modelling behaviour; children are picking up on our every word and action, learning what’s appropriate and acceptable by watching those around them and soaking it all in like tiny sponges. Sometimes called “observational learning”, it doesn’t just apply to kids’ caregivers either. The models “do not have to be people that the child directly interacts with. Children learn from models all around them, on television, in the grocery store, at school and at home,” according to one article published by Michigan State University. Whether or not you have children yourself, the way you behave in the world – including being surgically attached to your device while out in the wild – is inherently shaping the next generation.', 'In the UK, people spend an average of five hours and six minutes a day on their phones, according to one piece of research. Another study estimated that adults spend 76 per cent of their waking hours online. It’s why I worry that the growing raft of measures aimed at minors, welcome as they are, are only solving one half of the equation.', 'The way you behave in the world – including being surgically attached to your device – is inherently shaping the next generation', 'The town of St Albans in Hertfordshire, for example, became a pioneer in 2024 by attempting to become the first smartphone-free city in the UK for children under 14; more than 30 local primary schools have banned the devices, while a collective of head teachers have called for parents to delay buying smartphones for their children until they reach Year 9 (aged 13-14). New Zealand has gone a step further, with the government having prohibited phones in schools, and the country is now considering a blanket ban on social media for children under 16 following a similar measure being approved in Australia (it’s due to come into effect at the end of this year).', 'The UK government is taking a softer approach, so far resisting calls to implement legal restrictions on smartphones for adolescents; however, it’s been reported that the technology secretary is seriously mulling a two-hour cap on social media apps for teens to tackle “addictive behaviour”.', 'These all feel like positive steps in the right direction, like the threat of harm to young people is finally being taken seriously.

The findings were published in the journal Psychological Bulletin.', '“Children are spending more and more time on screens, for everything from entertainment to homework to messaging friends,” said Michael Noetel, PhD, an associate professor in the School of Psychology at Queensland University and one of the authors of the study. “We found that increased screen time can lead to emotional and behavioral problems, and kids with those problems often turn to screens to cope.”', 'Noetel and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis to better understand the relationship between screen time and socio-emotional problems, like aggression, anxiety, or low self-confidence. They included any study with participants under 10 years of age that measured screen use and socio-emotional problems, where children were followed-up for at least six months. Screen-based activities included social media, video games, TV watching and online homework.

This included both internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression, and externalizing problems, such as aggression and hyperactivity. Conversely, children experiencing socio-emotional problems were found to be more likely to turn to screens as a coping mechanism.', 'The researchers identified several factors that may moderate these relationships. Compared with younger children  (ages 0-5), older children (ages 6-10) were more likely to develop socio-emotional problems with greater screen use. Girls were generally more susceptible to developing socio-emotional problems with greater screen use, while boys were more likely to increase screen use when facing socio-emotional challenges.', 'The type of screen content and purpose of screen use also played a role, according to Noetel. Gaming was associated with higher risks compared with educational or recreational screen use. Children experiencing socio-emotional problems were also more likely to turn to games to cope.', 'The findings suggest parents might want to be cautious about what screens they allow and use parental controls to manage time, said Noetel. He also noted that kids who use screens heavily might need emotional support, not just restrictions. Parents could benefit from programs helping them handle both screen use and emotional problems.', ""“This comprehensive study highlights the need for a nuanced approach to managing children's screen time,” said lead author Roberta Vasconcellos, PhD, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who conducted the research while a doctoral student at Australian Catholic University. “By understanding the bidirectional relationship between screen use and socio-emotional problems, parents, educators and policymakers can better support children's healthy development in an increasingly digital world.”"", 'Because every study in the meta-analysis followed kids over time, the research is a big step closer to cause‑and‑effect (as opposed to correlation) than the usual snapshots done at a single point in time, according to Noetel.', '“It’s about as close as we can get to causal evidence without randomly cutting screens for thousands of kids,” he said. “But still, we can’t completely rule out other factors—like parenting style—that could influence both screen use and emotional problems.”', 'Article: “Electronic screen use and children’s socio-emotional problems: A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies,” by Roberta Pires Vasconcellos, PhD, Taren Sanders, PhD, Chris Lonsdale, PhD, Philip Parker, PhD, Diego Vasconcellos, PhD, Katrina Wilhite, PhD, Ella Tremaine, and Bridget Booker, PhD, Australian Catholic University; James Conigrave, PhD, La Trobe University; Samantha Tang, PhD, Black Dog Institute; Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD, European University of Madrid; Stuart J.
