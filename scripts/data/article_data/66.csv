"SpaceX launches GPS III SV-08, boosting anti-jamming capabilities",https://www.gpsworld.com/spacex-launches-gps-iii-sv-08-boosting-anti-jamming-capabilities/,"['SpaceX successfully launched the GPS III SV-08 satellite into orbit on May 30 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking a significant milestone for the U.S. Space Force’s rapid-response capabilities. The mission, executed in close coordination with Lockheed Martin and SpaceX, launched the eighth GPS III satellite into the constellation after an accelerated preparation period of just three months, well ahead of the traditional two-year timeline for national security launches.', 'The GPS III SV-08, named after the pioneering NASA mathematician Ms. Katherine Johnson, is part of the next-generation GPS IIIF satellites designed to enhance accuracy and incorporate advanced anti-jamming features for both military and civilian users. Built by Lockheed Martin, the spacecraft is equipped with M-Code technology, delivering signals that are three times more accurate and eight times more resistant to jamming than previous generations. These improvements are critical as threats to GPS reliability, such as jamming and interference, continue to increase.', 'In a press statement, Col. Andrew Menschner of the Space Force emphasized the urgency behind the accelerated launch schedule to mitigate increasing GPS jamming and interference: “There are 38 GPS satellites in orbit, 31 of which operate on a daily basis. We have a healthy redundancy in the constellation. But the addition of SV-08 allows the constellation to build resistance against those who would try to interfere with GPS signals.”', 'This launch marks the second time the Space Force has demonstrated its ability to deploy a GPS satellite on a compressed schedule. The previous rapid-response mission, dubbed Rapid Response Trailblazer, saw the seventh GPS III satellite launched in December 2024 after five months of planning. For SV-08, the team further reduced the schedule by 40%, reflecting lessons learned and increased efficiency.', 'Looking ahead, the final two GPS III satellites will be launched on United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, paving the way for the next-generation GPS IIIF satellites. According to Lockheed Martin, these spacecraft will introduce even greater anti-jamming capabilities, fully digital navigation payloads and advanced features such as regional military protection and improved search-and-rescue support, further enhancing the robustness and utility of the GPS constellation.', 'If you enjoyed this article, subscribe to GPS World to receive more articles just like it.', 'DIGITAL EDITION', '© 2025 North Coast Media LLC, All Rights Reserved.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNW5aMlpLTWtsSlZHZDFRa3RNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdNQklBRQ=-w280-h168-p-df

"Space Force, SpaceX Launch GPS Satellite in Record Time",https://www.airandspaceforces.com/space-force-spacex-launch-gps-satellite-in-record-time/,"['The Space Force has launched its latest GPS satellite in record time from preparation to liftoff, as part of its ongoing effort to improve navigation for troops and the public and create a more flexible launch schedule.', 'GPS III Space Vehicle-08 lifted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla., on May 30. From initial planning through receiving the satellite from Lockheed Martin and transporting it via the Air Force’s C-17 cargo plane to Florida for launch, the entire process took the Space Force about three months, marking the service’s fastest turnaround for a GPS satellite launch to date. Previous GPS missions have typically taken up to two years from start to finish.', '“Today’s launch showed our ability to respond to an operational need, such as an on-orbit vehicle failure within the GPS constellation,” Col. Andrew Menschner, Mission Delta 31 commander, said in a statement emailed to Air & Space Forces Magazine. Mission Delta 31 is currently overseeing GPS III Space Vehicle-07, which launched in December.', 'The operation builds on another successful satellite launch in December that completed the mission within five months. Guardians are working to accelerate the turnaround time for national-security launches to reach a broader goal of “tactically responsive space”—the ability to place a new satellite in orbit quickly in response to a crisis.', '“It highlights another instance of the Space Force’s ability to complete high-priority launches on a rapid timescale, which demonstrates the capability to respond to emergent constellation needs as rapidly as Space Vehicle readiness allows,” Col. Jim Horne, senior materiel leader of Launch Execution for Assured Access to Space, said in a release.', 'Space Systems Command originally picked the United Launch Alliance to handle the GPS III Space Vehicle-07 and -08 missions, but ULA’s new Vulcan rocket was still awaiting certification for use in military launches by the time the satellites were ready. The rocket was certified in March, but delays and a backlog have hampered ULA’s ability to meet military launch demands.', 'Space Force leaders, concerned about the security of American military satellites on orbit, instead chose to carry both missions on SpaceX rockets to accelerate deployment of anti-jamming capabilities and get critical navigation assets into orbit as swiftly as possible. In doing so, they shifted later GPS missions— the ninth and 10th GPS III satellites—to fly on Vulcan rockets instead. The next GPS III launch is expected at the end of this year.', '“It highlights our ability to rapidly deploy an additional M-Code-capable satellite and continues to push the boundaries of traditional launch timelines,” added Menschner. “With 31 active vehicles, seven on orbit in reserve status, and two GPS III vehicles completed and ready for launch, the constellation is healthy and ready to support the six billion people around the world who use our capabilities every day.”', 'This is the eighth GPS III satellite crafted by Lockheed, equipped with advanced M-Code technology that makes its signals significantly tougher to hack or jam. While earlier GPS models could broadcast M-Code, the GPS III series fully unlocks its potential by precisely targeting signals to specific regions. The Space Force touts it as delivering signals “three times more accurate and eight times more resistant to interference.” GPS III satellites are also equipped with a new L1C signal that is compatible with other global navigation satellite systems to enhance connectivity for civilian users.', 'The Space Force officials have stressed the need to launch more of these satellites to make more GPS capability available to the military alone. To support that effort, the service expanded its investment with Lockheed earlier this week by ordering two additional GPS III Follow-On satellites under a new $509.8 million contract modification. This latest order brings the total value of the company’s GPS III contract to more than $4.1 billion for a total of 22 satellites. The two new satellites—designated Space Vehicles 21 and 22—are scheduled for delivery by November 2031.', ""Get your daily fix of Air & Space Force news delivered right to your inbox every day.

It will broadcast additional military and civilian signals.', 'Along with delivering more GPS capacity, the launch was the second in a series of Rapid Response Trailblazer missions the Space Force is running to test whether it can quickly launch high-value satellites in response to national security needs. The goal is to condense a process that can take up to two years down to a handful of months.', 'The first mission, which flew in December, reduced the time between launch notification and lift off to around five months — and the May 30th mission shortened it even further, to around 90 days.', '“What we’re demonstrating here is that it is possible with our current vehicle systems that if there is a need to get something on orbit quickly, something that is unpredicted at the time we put it in our contract, we have the capacity, and we know what it would take in order to make that happen,” Mission Director Walt Lauderdale told reporters in a May 28 pre-launch briefing.', 'The Space Force has shown through its Tactically Responsive Launch program that it can launch small payloads on commercial rockets on demand, but RRT is proving that capability on larger, more complex payloads.', 'The service opted to conduct its first RRT missions with GPS III satellites for a few reasons. For starters, the military signal, M-Code, is in high demand from DOD users.', 'In both cases, the spacecraft had been previously slated to fly on United Launch Alliance’s new Vulcan rocket, which until recently hadn’t been certified to fly national security missions. Because GPS III satellites are qualified to fly on multiple vehicles, the Space Force was able to fairly easily swap the missions to a SpaceX rocket, allowing it to test the flexibility of both the launch firm and Lockheed as the satellite provider.', 'According to Col. Andrew Menschner, commander of Mission Delta 31, the team has shared the importance of multi-vehicle qualification with Space Force leadership, and he expects more spacecraft will have that built-in flexibility in the future.', 'The effort also benefitted from the fact there were multiple GPS III satellites in Lockheed’s factory waiting for a ride, Menschner said in the same briefing. Using those spacecraft for a mission like this helped demonstrate the utility of having systems on standby, ready to launch when needed.', '“We’re trying to prove that we can quickly respond to an on-orbit failure of a vehicle, but we’re also trying to show the best ways to be resilient now that we have the timelines of launch headed to much shorter durations,” Menschner said. “One form of resilience is having a completed vehicle in the factory and ready to go to respond.”', 'Lauderdale noted that while these missions have proven faster timelines are possible, the service may not opt to apply the concepts to all future GPS launches.

Initially assigned to ULA’s Vulcan, both a December 2024 launch and then Friday’s launch were shifted to Falcon 9 as ULA faced an extended delay in certification of its replacement for both its Atlas V and Delta IV class of rockets.', 'While called the GPS III-7 mission, it’s actually the eighth of 10 satellites constructed by Lockheed Martin to add to the U.S.’s GPS capability in space. It’s also part of an accelerated mission timeline laid out by the Space Force for national security missions in which payloads get to space in under three months from the decision to go, compared to the normal turnaround that can take up to 24 months.', '“It highlights another instance of the Space Force’s ability to complete high priority launches on a rapid timescale, which demonstrates the capability to respond to emergent constellation needs as rapidly as space vehicle readiness allows,” said Space Force Col. Jim Horne, senior materiel leader of launch execution with the Assured Access to Space program.', 'The latest GPS satellites are three times more accurate and eight times more resistant to jamming than the other 38 in space already, according to the Space Force.', 'The Department of Defense’s desire to launch more effective GPS hardware, less susceptible to interference, forced the switch to SpaceX in both missions.', 'The NSSL Phase 2 contract, which featured five years’ worth of task orders announced from 2020-2024, was originally announced to give ULA 60% of the assignments. All of those were supposed to fly on Vulcan, with its first launches to be completed by summer 2022.', 'But as Vulcan faced myriad delays, the final spate of task orders ended up putting 26 missions on ULA’s plate to SpaceX’s 22. Now another two of those missions have swapped from ULA to SpaceX, although the Space Force has said ULA will get back two future missions previously assigned to SpaceX.', 'To date, ULA has only managed to fly one of those 26 missions, and that wasn’t on a Vulcan. Instead ULA was forced to use one of its few remaining Atlas V rockets, which flew last summer.', 'ULA, which is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that formed in 2006, had originally been targeting mid-2020 for Vulcan’s debut. But it faced hurdles from COVID, acquisition of engines from supplier Blue Origin, delays from customer payloads and even a fiery test stand incident that all contributed to a nearly four-year slide.', 'It flew for the first time in January 2024, but not again until that October, both as part of ULA’s efforts to get national security certification. An issue with a solid rocket booster motor detaching during launch on the second flight, though, delayed that certification until March 2025.', 'At this point, the first national security launch on Vulcan won’t be until at least July, according to Major Gen. Stephen G. Purdy, the acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration.', 'Purdy, a former head of Space Launch Delta 45 based at Patrick Space Force Base, raised concerns about ULA’s delays during written testimony released earlier this month to the U.S. House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.', '“In NSSL Phase 2, the ULA Vulcan program has performed unsatisfactorily this past year,” he wrote. “Major issues with the Vulcan have overshadowed its successful certification resulting in delays to the launch of four national security missions. Despite the retirement of highly successful Atlas and Delta launch vehicles, the transition to Vulcan has been slow and continues to impact the completion of Space Force mission objectives.”', 'Vulcan’s certification is at the point only partial, having only been signed off for five of the Space Force’s nine required orbital needs, Purdy said. He did said ULA has increased its “engineering resources and management focus to resolve design issues” while government personnel have been more involved with both technical and program management.', 'Purdy said ULA’s first national security launch on Vulcan will be USSF-106. The payload, Navigation Technology Satellite-3, is headed to geostationary orbit. Built by L3Harris, it’s funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory and a potential replacement technology for GPS. It was one of two task orders given to ULA in 2020 with a value of $337 million. The other, USSF-51, was the one that launched last summer on an Atlas V.', 'With ULA dealing with a backlog of the Phase 2 contract missions, the company’s piece of the next pie got smaller. Earlier this year, the Space Force announced SpaceX, not ULA, would get the majority of the Phase 3 contracts with a total of $13.7 billion to be doled out over the next five years. SpaceX would receive 28 of 54 planned missions, or 52%. Meanwhile, ULA’s take is only 19 missions, or 35%, while newcomer Blue Origin would get seven, or 13%.', 'Purdy confirmed ULA had already lost out on some Phase 3 contracts because of the Vulcan delays, and addressed what he deemed to be ULA’s marching orders along with other commercial providers that have fallen short on delivery to the government.', '“For these programs, the prime contractors must re-establish baselines, establish a culture of accountability, and repair trust deficit to prove to (me) that they are adopting the acquisition principles necessary to deliver capabilities at speed, on cost and on schedule,” he said', 'ULA meanwhile is dipping its toes back into launches, lining up only its second planned mission of the year, a commercial launch for customer Amazon using another of its remaining Atlas V rockets. Following the April launch of the first mission for Amazon’s Project Kuiper, an internet satellite constellation that aims to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink system, the second mission is targeting liftoff no earlier than June 13.', 'Meanwhile, SpaceX has now flown its Falcon 9 on 65 missions this year, including 44 from the Space Coast.', '------------']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNW5aMlpLTWtsSlZHZDFRa3RNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdNQklBRQ=-w280-h168-p-df
