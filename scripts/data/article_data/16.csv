North Korean Frigate Now Floating Upright After Partially Capsizing During Disastrous Launch,https://www.twz.com/sea/north-korean-frigate-now-floating-after-partially-capsizing-during-disastrous-launch,"['HOWARD ALTMAN', 'UPDATED JUN 5, 2025 3:11 PM EDT', 'COPYRIGHT © 2025 BY PLANET. IMAGE MAY NOT BE REPUBLISHED WITHOUT PERMISSION/CSIS/BEYOND PARALLEL/PLANET.', 'The TWZ Newsletter', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy', 'The North Korean frigate that rolled over and was partially submerged during its botched launch ceremony last month is now floating on its own, a new satellite image shows. It is the latest sign of progress after a mishap that embarrassed North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who attended the ceremony. This roughly fits in with North Korea’s initial estimate that it would take “10-odd days to restore the warship’s side.”', '“Kim Jong Un’s instructions to restore” the unnamed Choi-Hyun class ship “before the end of June have been met with skepticism,” 38 North, a website devoted to the analysis of North Korea, noted on Thursday. “Commercial satellite imagery shows workers at the port in Chongjin have taken a significant step towards that goal.”  ', 'In the new image, captured by Planet Labs, the vessel can be seen moored in the middle of O-Hang harbor, away from the dock where it rolled into the water on May 21. There are two smaller vessels just off its starboard side and several more a bit further away on the port side. From the quality of the image, it is difficult to determine the level of damage the ship incurred after being partially underwater for more than two weeks. The ship was turned upright earlier this week, which you can read more about in our report here.', 'The image shows that North Korea “has successfully completed initial salvage operations,” according to the latest analysis by Beyond Parallel, a project within the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).', '“As best can be presently determined, the vessel may be listing slightly to port, numerous small marine salvage balloons are visible alongside and aboard the vessel, and what appears to be a large lift bag or temporary ramp is visible on the slide slipway,” Beyond Parallel posited. “The slight listing and presence of the balloons suggest that the salvage operation is not complete, with continued pumping, stabilization, and refurbishment operations remaining. It remains unclear whether the vessel will remain at the Hambuk Shipyard at Chongjin or be moved to another shipyard for this work, fitting-out, and subsequent commissioning.”', 'Beyond Parallel could not ascertain from the image how badly the ship was damaged.', '“Those are great questions, but not ones we can answer right now with the limited resolution of the image,” Jennifer Jun, Associate Fellow for Imagery Analysis at CSIS, told us. “We’ll continue to monitor for better collects in the coming days.”', 'At a press conference on Thursday, a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said that additional repair work on the ship is in progress. However, he did not elaborate on whether Kim’s demand that the frigate be restored by the time the next Party Central Committee meeting is held later this month will be met. This goal is outright questionable, if not impossible to meet.', '“Further analysis is needed, such as whether a change has occurred in the warship’s keel,” according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency.', '“‘The North Korean warship inclined at the Chongjin port returned to an upright position earlier this week and additional (restoration) efforts are believed to be in progress,’ Col. Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), told a regular press briefing,” Yonhap reported. “Both South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities are closely monitoring activities at the Chongjin port and the nearby area.” ', 'The vessel, which has an estimated displacement of 5,000 tons, is the second in its Choi Hyun class, following the Choi Hyon. That ship was officially unveiled in April. You can read all about the heavily armed class of frigates in our previous detailed analysis and follow-up report. ', 'Earlier this week, a satellite image showed that second vessel finally upright, but still at the dock and covered in blue tarps. You can catch up with our story about that here. As we noted in that story, an analysis by 38 North showed the efforts North Korea was taking to right the vessel.', '38 North suggested that the launch mechanism may have become stuck in the ship’s bow, pinning it onto the land while the stern slipped into the water, after which the boat overturned. In the May 29 imagery, there appeared to be damage around the bow section. That is in stark contrast to North Korea’s initial claim that the vessel was unharmed — a dubious, if not implausible assertion.', 'In our previous report, we noted that there is not a dry dock that the vessel could be moved into readily at Chongjin if major repair work is required. However, now that the ship is floating, it could be easier to take it to a facility that can fix major hull damage.', 'Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com', 'The frigate looks to be upright again, but the full extent of the damage remains unclear, as is how they will move it somewhere to get fixed.', 'In a rare move, North Korea has admitted to the accident and Kim Jong Un is demanding severe punishment for those responsible.', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'TYLER ROGOWAY', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'GEOFF ZIEZULEWICZ', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN, TYLER ROGOWAY', 'HOWARD ALTMAN, TYLER ROGOWAY', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By Signing Up You Agree To Our Terms Of Service And Privacy Policy.', '© 2024 Recurrent Ventures.

Bermudez, an analyst in North Korean defense at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.', 'One striking aspect was the speed at which state-controlled North Korean media publicized the incident that damaged its newest warship and also named the officials.', 'The highly public nature of the announcements suggests Kim is ""very upset,"" Bermudez added.', ""The arrests came within days of the botched launch of the nameless 5,000-ton destroyer, which saw the ship topple onto its side and its hull damaged. It's believed the mechanism that rolled the ship into the water malfunctioned, leaving the ship's bow stuck on the pier while its aft section lay in the water and flooded."", ""State-run outlets announced the arrests, placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of the shipyard's chief engineer, the head of the hull construction workshop, and a deputy manager for administrative affairs."", ""At the top of the list: Ri Hyong Son, a vice director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee, who was also arrested."", ""The warship was one of two next-generation Choe Hyon-class destroyers. The first, the titular Choe Hyon, launched a month ago to great fanfare at Nampo Harbor on the peninsula's western coast."", ""But the second was constructed at the eastern Chongjin shipyard, which doesn't typically produce large warships, Bermudez said."", 'Rather than launching it in drydock or from a slipway, North Korea attempted a sideways launch — something the workers might not have been well-practiced at with a larger vessel, Bermudez said.', 'When it came to the bigger ship, ""all of a sudden, you\'re starting to use a piece that hasn\'t been used in years,"" he said.', 'On Monday, satellite images showed that the bow of the ship was still stuck on the pier, with evidence of a dredging operation at the harbor entrance.', 'Following the launch, state media put the ""responsible"" officials on blast.', 'This was a choice.', '""Normally these things are done quietly,"" Bermudez said.', 'Within hours of the disaster, the Pyongyang Times reported Kim denouncing it at length, calling it a ""criminal act"" that ""could not be tolerated."" Multiple detailed updates to the recovery operation have followed.', ""The Choe Hyon-class destroyer is a step toward a major ambition of Kim's: transforming North Korea's primarily coastal navy into a blue-water fleet, Bermudez said."", 'A setback to that project is a ""slap in the face"" for Kim, he added.', 'Though the full capabilities of the new ship are not yet known, its sister ship, the Choe Hyon — the first in the class — wields modern capabilities such as an air defence system and vertically launched missiles.', 'State media has said it can carry nuclear-capable missiles — in which case, the program is ""very much interlinked with North Korea\'s broader nuclear ambitions,"" said Edward Howell, an expert on North Korean politics at the University of Oxford.', '""The fact that it failed so miserably was pretty embarrassing for Kim,"" who is ""captivated"" by developing naval power, Bruce Bennett, a North Korea-focused defense analyst at the RAND think tank, told BI.', ""It's even more galling in the wake of large-scale South Korean naval drills in the Yellow Sea earlier this month — which showcased its naval power after the launch of the first Choe Hyon."", 'And there was another reason to denounce the named officials: In terms of domestic politics, ""it puts everybody on notice,"" Bermudez said.', 'When big programs that really matter to Kim fail, ""he\'s going to take retribution,"" he added.', 'Though officials have now said the damage isn\'t as bad as first assessed — something BI couldn\'t independently verify — it\'s still going to be treated with utmost seriousness in order to ""deal a telling blow to incautiousness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricist attitude prevailing in any field,"" state media said.', ""It's unclear exactly what will happen to the officials named."", 'Various punishments are possible through the judicial system, but all too often, ""\'due process\' is a bullet in the head,"" RAND\'s Bennett said.', 'In January, North Korea executed two unnamed nuclear power plant construction researchers for failing to complete their project and improve technological standards, Daily NK reported. Their junior colleagues were transported to what is believed to be a political prison camp, the outlet reported.', 'Regardless of what punishment is handed down, one thing is likely: It\'ll also hit the officials\' families. In the logic of the North Korean justice system, convictions are ""because of a significant family flaw,"" Bennett said. ""Therefore, three generations of the family need to be dealt with.""', ""That could mean the officials' spouses, parents, and even kids could be sent to grim prison camps — and could also be downgraded within the country's system of social hierarchy, Songbun."", '""We don\'t know what their fates will be,"" said Howell. ""Their fates don\'t look to be very pleasant.""', '""But crucially,"" he added, ""this is going to make no impact on North Korea\'s broader quest for naval modernization, military modernization.""', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iNkNnNHpkVE5PYnpnd1ZqY3dWWGRJVFJDUEF4alhCQ2dLTWc0QkFJQWczYUZhWWZ1RUQ0SmJFdw=-w280-h168-p-df

Some reports have suggested these were barrage balloons, although that doesn’t appear to make any sense in this case.', 'At this stage, it’s not possible to determine the level of damage that the frigate sustained during its abortive launch. 38 North suggests that the launch mechanism may have become stuck in the ship’s bow, pinning it onto the land while the stern slipped into the water, after which the boat overturned. In the May 29 imagery, there appears to be damage around the bow section.', 'If the ship has been successfully righted, what the next steps might be in the repair process are unclear. There is not a dry dock that the vessel could be moved into readily at Chongjin if that level of work is required.

Instead, a malfunction in the launch mechanism on May 21 caused the stern to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull and leaving the bow stranded on the shipway, state media KCNA reported, in a rare admission of bad news.', 'North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who witnessed the failed launch in the northeastern city of Chongjin, called it a “criminal act” and ordered the country to swiftly repair the as-yet-unnamed ship before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party, calling it a matter of national honor.', 'Officials have since scrambled to undo the damage and punish those they claim are responsible, detaining four people in recent days, including the shipyard’s chief engineer.', 'Analysts say it appears balloons are being used in North Korea’s effort to swiftly repair the destroyer.', '“It looks like what appear to be balloons have been installed not to refloat the ship, but to prevent the ship from further flooding,” said Rep. Yu Yong-weon, a South Korean National Assembly lawmaker and military analyst.', 'Retired United States Navy Cpt. Carl Schuster said if the objects are indeed balloons, they could have one of two purposes – either to prevent “low- to mid-level drone reconnaissance,” or to reduce the stress on the part of the ship still stranded on the pier.', '“That is the area that is most likely to have been damaged, suffered the most severe damage and remains under intense stress while the forward area remains out of the water,” he said.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nNorth Korea arrests four over failed warship launch as images show vessel shielded from prying eyes', 'Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said North Korea could be in danger of further damaging the ship if it’s using balloons to keep it afloat or raise it.', '“It is highly likely that the ship is under quite a lot of stress anyway,” and lifting from above could compound those stresses, he said.', 'Normal procedure would be to get as much buoyancy as possible in the ship and then raise it from below, Childs said.', 'According to satellite images shared by Maxar Technologies, more than a dozen white, balloon-like objects have been deployed around the destroyer since May 23.', 'Based on the objects’ shape and what appear to be tail fins, they could be smaller versions of what are known as aerostat aircraft, balloons with a slight resemblance to dirigibles, defense experts told CNN. Like blimps, dirigibles get buoyancy from a lifting gas that allows them to float in air or in water.', 'The images don’t appear to show any flotation bladders supporting the hull or the body of the ship, Schuster said – something the US might use in such a situation. He added that North Korea’s maritime industry might not be advanced enough for such techniques.', 'North Korean state media had previously reported that the damage was less severe than initially feared, and that there were no holes in the hull, though it was scratched along the side and some seawater had entered the stern. It estimated repairs could take about 10 days – though analysts are skeptical.', 'Schuster had previously told CNN that repair work could take up to six months, depending on how far the hull damage extends, how much water entered the warship, and how much “salt crust” might have formed on metal surfaces such as joints.', 'The ship’s precarious position also makes the salvage operation unusually complex. “Having it half in and half out of the water is basically the worst possible situation,” said Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a nonprofit specializing in defense research.', 'He added that the operation would be simpler if the ship had fully capsized into the water, or if it had fallen over entirely on land. “But as it’s half on land and half on water – if you try to pull the sunken half out, you’re risking twisting and breaking the keel,” Eveleth said, referring to the structural spine running along the ship’s bottom. “And if you do that, the whole ship is junk.”', 'Childs said North Korea may have to cut the ship into pieces and then try to salvage what it can because righting it from its current position is an extremely complex task.', '“Very often the only way you clear the dock … is to dismantle at least part of the ship to make the operation easier, right what you have left and tow it away and make a decision on whether you rebuild it or scrap it,” he said.', 'CNN’s Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Kim lavishly praised that ship, which was launched in the western port of Nampo, saying it advances his goal of expanding the military’s operations range and nuclear strike capabilities.', 'State media described that ship as designed to handle various weapons systems, including anti-air and anti-ship weapons as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim also supervised test-firings of missiles from the destroyer afterward, and state media said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year.', 'While North Korea’s naval forces are widely seen as far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say a destroyer equipped with modern missile and radar systems could still boost the North’s offensive and defensive capabilities.', 'South Korean officials and experts say the North’s destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries’ military cooperation have intensified amid Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. Kim’s government has supplied Russia with thousands of troops and large shipments of military equipment, including artillery and ballistic missiles, to support its warfighting. Washington and Seoul have expressed concern that, in return, Kim may seek Russian technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military.', 'Kim met with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday in the latest sign of the countries’ deepening ties.', 'Kim has framed his arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanded joint military exercises in reaction to the North’s advancing nuclear program. Kim says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.', ""This report has been edited to correct that North Korea's statement was issued Friday, not Saturday."", 'Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The Strategic Implications of North Korea’s Failed Naval Vessel Launch,https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2025/05/30/the_strategic_implications_of_north_koreas_failed_naval_vessel_launch_1113407.html,"['On May 21, 2025, North Korea’s much-anticipated launch of a 5,000-ton warship ended in embarrassment when the vessel ran aground during the slipway launch process at the northeastern port of Chongjin. What was intended as a grand demonstration of Pyongyang’s naval modernization ambitions devolved into a technical and political failure, prompting immediate arrests of senior shipyard officials and internal purges. While the incident may appear on the surface to be a construction mishap, its implications run far deeper—illuminating the contradictions, vulnerabilities, and persistence of North Korea’s defense strategy.', 'The destroyer-class vessel, reportedly a sister ship to the Choe Hyon-class warship unveiled just weeks earlier, was designed to symbolize a new chapter in North Korea’s growing maritime ambitions. Kim Jong-un’s personal involvement in the earlier launch of the class and recent rhetorical emphasis on “a powerful ocean navy” made this particular project a centerpiece of national pride. The vessel’s appearance—with a 76mm main gun, anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, and close-in weapons systems—suggested a serious attempt to project naval strength and modernity.', 'However, the launch failure laid bare the gap between appearance and capability. According to reports, the warship’s launching cradles moved unevenly, causing the stern to drop into the water prematurely while the bow remained stuck on the slipway. The result was a twisted hull, partial flooding, and visible damage to the ship’s structure. In response, the regime immediately detained several senior figures at the Chongjin shipyard, including its chief engineer and general manager—a move that reflects both the political stakes of the incident and the regime’s need to reassert control.', 'Beyond the immediate consequences, the event exposed enduring limitations in North Korea’s naval development. While Pyongyang has made undeniable progress in missile technology, its ability to build and deploy large-scale conventional naval platforms remains rudimentary. The ship lacked visible advanced sensors or integrated combat systems, and its propulsion is believed to be diesel-based—significantly limiting its operational range and endurance. In short, this was a vessel built for strategic messaging more than sustained maritime operations.', 'That messaging has now been significantly undercut. Just weeks before the failed launch, state media had hailed the new warship as a symbol of North Korea’s growing maritime power. Its sudden and very public failure represents a serious blow to that narrative. Unlike missile tests, which can be framed as experimental and iterative, a failed ship launch—particularly one involving such a high-profile asset—is harder to explain away. The regime’s decision to respond with arrests and likely purges is as much about protecting Kim Jong-un’s leadership image as it is about correcting technical deficiencies.', 'Still, the incident is unlikely to derail North Korea’s trajectory. If anything, it may compel the regime to accelerate its naval projects in an attempt to regain prestige. Pyongyang has historically responded to setbacks not by retreating, but by doubling down—unveiling new platforms, conducting additional weapons tests, and framing these efforts as defiance against external pressure. This dynamic suggests that another high-profile launch or naval event may not be far off.', 'At the same time, the incident offers a clearer view into the limitations of North Korea’s military-industrial base. Despite the regime’s ability to generate powerful optics—missile parades, submarine mockups, and now large warships—many of its systems are fragile beneath the surface. The centralized, punitive nature of its defense production ecosystem also stifles innovation and encourages risk-averse behavior, which can result in poorly executed but politically expedient outcomes.', 'Even so, flawed platforms can still be dangerous. A warship does not need to be technologically advanced to pose a threat if used asymmetrically—whether through harassment operations in disputed waters, support to coastal missile deployments, or as a launch point for drones or cruise missiles. In this sense, even an imperfect vessel can serve strategic functions, particularly when wielded by a regime that prizes disruption and surprise.', 'The failed launch serves as a vivid reminder that North Korea’s military modernization is as much about perception as capability. The regime remains committed to expanding its military power across all domains, and naval development—however uneven—will continue to be part of that effort. The challenge for regional actors is to remain vigilant not only about what North Korea builds, but how it uses failure to justify further escalation.', 'While the ship may lie damaged in drydock, North Korea’s ambitions have not run aground. The regime’s ability to turn setbacks into propaganda, and to exploit perception as a weapon in itself, ensures that incidents like this one—far from derailing their plans—may simply become the fuel for the next chapter.', 'Jihoon Yu is a research fellow and the director of external cooperation at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.

Quick Take: Chongjin Destroyer Recovery Efforts Continue,https://www.38north.org/2025/05/quick-take-chongjin-destroyer-recovery-efforts-continue/,"['On May 21, North Korea attempted to launch the second destroyer in its new Choe Hyon Class at Chongjin Port. As reported in North Korean State media, the side-launch resulted in a “serious accident,” due to “inexperienced command and operational carelessness”. Specifically, the stern hit the water first, leaving the ship’s bow hung up on the launch way. Further exacerbating the incident were openings in the unfinished deck of the vessel which allowed water to pour into its interior compartments as the ship laid on its side in the water. Kim Jong Un set a June deadline for the restoration of the vessel, and commercial satellite imagery indicates that swift efforts to remove the ship from the water are underway.', 'On imagery from May 29, over 30 probable barrage balloons have been positioned alongside the vessel to help lift and/or keep the vessel afloat. Another five were on the quay. In addition, cables are attached to to the ship, tethering it to stabilize its position.', 'Two nearby support vessels are pumping water out of the ship, in efforts to float the destroyer and remove its bow from the launch mechanism. On land, dollies have been pulled back to the building ways. These dollies had been used to move the ship to the launch mechanism, where levers were inserted to raise the vessel for the actual launch.', 'In addition, the channel providing sole access to the inner harbor is being dredged, an action necessary due to built-up silt. This area must be cleared to allow for the eventual departure of the new destroyer.', 'These efforts indicate progress from immediately after the incident. Imagery from May 22 indicated the blue tarp was placed over the majority of the vessel, particularly over the forward half of the ship, concealing remnants of the launch mechanism that did not separate during the launch attempt and likely to help obstruct analysis of the cause of the failure and severity of the damage to the vessel.', 'Several cranes were tethered to the ship at that time, likely restraining it from slipping into the water and flooding completely.', 'At the building ways, new hull plates are visible, although material is covering other portions of the construction activity.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iNkNnNHpkVE5PYnpnd1ZqY3dWWGRJVFJDUEF4alhCQ2dLTWc0QkFJQWczYUZhWWZ1RUQ0SmJFdw=-w280-h168-p-df
