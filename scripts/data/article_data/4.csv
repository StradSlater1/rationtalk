Gavin Newsom cannot even agree on how they left their last conversation, late on Friday evening on the East Coast, as protests picked up around the city.', 'Aides to Trump told The Times he issued a clear warning: “Get the police in gear.” His patience would last less than 24 hours before he chose a historic path, federalizing the National Guard against the wishes of state and local officials.', 'The governor, on the other hand, told MSNBC the account is a lie. In their 40-minute call, not once did the president raise the prospect of wresting control over the National Guard from state and local officials.', 'They have not spoken since, a White House official said.', 'Trump went even further on Monday, raising the specter of Newsom’s arrest and supplementing the National Guard operation with a historic deployment of active-duty U.S. Marines.', 'The troop deployment is yet another extraordinary effort to quell simmering demonstrations across Los Angeles, some of which have turned violent, in protest of flash raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in recent days.', 'Newsom’s government said Monday it would sue the Trump administration over the deployment and issued scathing criticism of Trump’s leadership, calling his Defense secretary a “joke” and the president “unhinged.” But the president and his top advisers responded with an especially pointed threat, suggesting the governor could be arrested for obstruction.', '“It is a basic principle in this country that if you break the law, you will face a consequence for that,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told The Times in an interview. “So if the governor obstructs federal enforcement, or breaks federal laws, then he is subjecting himself to arrest.”', 'CALIFORNIA', '', 'Earlier in the day, Tom Homan, the president’s so-called border czar, said that no one is above the law and that anyone — including the governor — who obstructs immigration enforcement would be subject to charges.', '“I would do it if I were Tom,” Trump said, pursing his lips as he appeared to consider the question as he was speaking to reporters on Monday. “I think it’s great.”', '“He’s done a terrible job,” Trump continued. “I like Gavin Newsom.

Leavitt would not say how long the operation might last, but suggested it would continue until violence at the protests ends.', '“I don’t want to get ahead of the president on any decisions or timelines,” she said. “I can tell you the White House is 100% focused on this. The president wants to solve the problem. And that means creating an environment where citizens, if they wish, are given the space and the right to peacefully protest.”', '“And these violent disruptors and insurrectionists, as the president has called them, are not only doing a disservice to law-abiding citizens, but to those who wish to peacefully protest.

Newsom on Monday said he will sue the Trump administration over the deployment.', 'Trump on Monday said it was a “great decision” to send in the National Guard.', '“If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “The very incompetent “Governor,” Gavin Newscum, and “Mayor,” Karen Bass, should be saying, “THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL.

The California governor called the move “unlawful” and urged the president to rescind it. But Homan said it was Newsom who had failed to address the violence, promising a quick and forceful federal response.', '“He’s failed that state. He waited two days of that city burning, officers being assaulted, before he made a declaration of unlawful assembly,” Homan told Fox News. “He’s late to the game. President Trump isn’t late to the game.”', 'In the wake of the weekend’s chaos, the city of Glendale, California, announced on Sunday it would terminate its agreement with DHS and ICE to house federal immigration detainees at the Glendale Police Department facility.', 'The city — just under 10 miles from Los Angeles — said the decision was not politically driven; rather, “the City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract — no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good — has become divisive.”', '“The Glendale Police Department is trusted and supported by the residents and businesses, and in turn, our officers work every day to protect and serve with professionalism and care,” the city added. “At this time, it is in our best interest to not allow that trust to be undermined.”', 'The chaotic situation comes as the Trump administration’s push to deport migrants in the U.S. illegally hit record highs last week — including 2,300 arrests last Thursday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the most ever in a single day for that agency.

Gavin Newsom “out of context,” insisting that he was “clear” that he didn’t feel the governor had “crossed the line” yet during the fiery Los Angeles protests.', 'With the demonstrations against the Trump administration’s immigration raids growing increasingly volatile over the weekend, resulting in the president ordering the National Guard to “liberate Los Angeles from the migrant invasion,” Homan told NBC News’ Jacob Soboroff that California Democrats could face apprehension if they interfered with ICE agents on the ground.', '“I’ll say it about anybody,” Homan said when asked if this also meant Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. “You cross that line, it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It’s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.”', 'At the same time, he said he wasn’t specifically accusing any politician of impeding law enforcement and that when it came to Bass, he didn’t believe “she’s crossed the line yet.” Still, he called Newsom an “embarrassment for the state” for providing “sanctuary for criminals,” suggesting that the governor “about public safety in the state of California.”', 'Trump would later double down on Homan’s rhetoric, telling reporters on Sunday that any “officials who stand in the way of law and order” will “face judges.”', 'In a separate interview with the same NBC reporter, Newsom fired back at Homan while taking issue with the Trump administration in general for further escalating tensions in the region by deploying the military to face off against the protesters.', ""Calling Homan’s bluff, Newsom told the Trump official to “just get it over with” and arrest him. “He’s a tough guy. Why doesn’t he do that? He knows where to find me,” he added. “That kind of bloviating is exhausting. So, Tom, arrest me. Let's go.”"", 'Despite Trump blasting him to reporters and online, Newsom said that during a recent phone conversation about the large-scale protests, the president barely even brought the issue up and didn’t express any concerns about Newsom’s ability to handle the demonstrations. “We had a very decent conversation,” the governor added.', 'Towards the end of his Monday interview on Morning Joe, which largely entailed him defending the administration’s response to the protests and the deportation policies that sparked them, Homan was asked to respond to Newsom’s taunts. Instead of defending his remarks, the border czar blasted Soboroff and fumed that he never threatened to arrest the governor or Bass.', '“I’m not biting on that,” he grumbled to anchor Jonathan Lemire. “The NBC reporter that interviewed me is very dishonest. We did a 20-minute interview, and he cuts out a little clip and takes my words out of context.”', 'Homan went on to state that what he “really said” was that when protesters “crossed the line” then they could find themselves apprehended by law enforcement.', '“They have a right to protest,” he continued. “They have the First Amendment rights, but they can’t cross that line. They can’t cross that line. They can’t cross that line of putting their hands on officers. They can’t cross the line.”Adding that “concealing an illegal alien” is also a federal crime, he asserted that anyone guilty of that statute “will be prosecuted.” At the same time, though, he insisted that he was only saying that it could include Bass and Newsom if they were involved in those activities.', '“I was clear they haven’t crossed the line. But they’re not above the law either,” he declared. “If they commit a crime, they certainly will ask for prosecution. That’s what was happening.”', 'Homan concluded: “I never threatened to arrest Gov. Newsom, so I’m not biting off in that.

During an earlier sitdown on Fox News, a network he spent the past few years working for as an on-air contributor, Trump’s hand-picked deportation enforcer attacked the NBC News reporter as a “joke” for his “ridiculous” interview.', '“Well, first of all, it’s just ridiculous,” he told Fox & Friends. “That reporter from MSNBC?

He’s a dishonest reporter,” Homan said. “I said many times, ‘You can protest; you get your First Amendment rights’—but when you cross that line, you put your hands on an ICE officer, or you destroy property or impede law enforcement, or you’re knowingly harboring and concealing an illegal alien, that’s a crime.

He’s a dishonest reporter,” Homan said. “I said many times, ‘You can protest; you get your First Amendment rights’—but when you cross that line, you put your hands on an ICE officer, or you destroy property or impede law enforcement, or you’re knowingly harboring and concealing an illegal alien, that’s a crime.

If they cross the line, commit a crime—absolutely, they can. So there was no discussion about arresting Newsom,” Homan added.', 'Homan’s original remarks to Soboroff on Saturday came amid widespread demonstrations and rioting across Los Angeles over federal immigration raids being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.', 'In his remarks on MSNBC, Homan said anyone found obstructing immigration enforcement could face arrest and did not rule out Newsom or Bass being detained under such circumstances.', '“I’ll say it about anybody,” Homan told MSNBC. “You cross that line—it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It’s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.”', 'Homan admitted that neither of the Democratic politicians is accused of breaking any law during the protests.', 'Newsom called Homan’s bluff in his own interview with Soboroff on Sunday.', '“He’s a tough guy—why doesn’t he do that? He knows where to find me,” Newsom said. “Arrest me. Let’s get it over with, tough guy. I don’t give a damn.”', 'Newsom has also repeatedly attacked Trump for his response to the L.A. protests, which include deploying thousands of National Guard troops without prior approval from the state of California and posting inflammatory remarks that risk inflaming tensions.', 'Elsewhere during his Fox News interview, Homan attacked Newsom for putting a negative spin on the immigration crackdowns in L.A.', '“ICE took a lot of bad people off the street that day.

I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”', 'It’s worth emphasizing for context that it’s unlikely we’ll see Newsom in handcuffs anytime soon. For one thing, there’s no reason to believe he has committed any crimes. For another, Homan doesn’t actually have any legal authority to arrest anyone, even if he wanted to, since a “border czar” is basically just an advisory position.', 'Indeed, hours before the president’s provocative comments, Homan appeared on Fox News and said there’s been “no discussion” about arresting the governor. He soon after added on MSNBC that he never actually even threatened to arrest Newsom (despite some evidence to the contrary).', 'None of that, however, makes Trump’s rhetoric any less outrageous. Sitting presidents are not supposed to go around talking publicly about the arrest of officials who’ve done nothing wrong. Indeed, Trump’s endorsement of Newsom’s arrest comes just days after the president directed the Justice Department to investigate Joe Biden — an unprecedented step that Trump admitted was based on no evidence — which marked the third time in as many months that the Republican has sought formal investigations into perceived political foes.', 'The California governor’s comments about “unmistakable” steps toward authoritarianism resonated for a reason.', 'Steve Benen is a producer for ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

By sending Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents into Los Angeles to arrest undocumented immigrants and then sending in the National Guard to restore order after riots erupted, Trump is doing nothing more than his job, something the Biden administration and Newsom himself largely abdicated.', 'Joe Biden’s border policies – somewhere between an open invitation and abject surrender before a late-term reversal – allowed waves of unwelcome migrants to enter the United States, millions of them, making it necessary for a tough surge of enforcement around the country to restore some respect for our borders. Gavin Newsom’s sanctuary state policies made sure that plenty of that enforcement would need to take place in California.', 'If Newsom didn’t want to see flash bang grenades deployed in Los Angeles restaurant kitchens and heavily armed federal agents in donut shops and Home Depots, maybe he shouldn’t have spent billions of taxpayer dollars making California a more welcoming home for people who broke the law.', 'The biggest move he made was to spend the state into a deficit offering Medical (California’s version of Medicaid) to those without legal status. It is a decision he has tried to partially reverse as the budget impact became clear.', 'More appalling was a law passed by California’s Democrat-dominated legislature to make undocumented immigrants eligible for six-figure housing down payment assistance or making poor citizens complete with the undocumented for scarce work-study opportunities at state universities and community colleges. You know, the places of education where citizens of El Salvador and Mexico already got cheaper tuition than those interloper immigrants from Missouri or Idaho.', 'Newsom says “Commandeering a state’s National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral.” That’s not exactly right. It wasn’t “illegal and immoral” for Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson to use commandeered National Guard units to enforce civil rights laws in 1965. And it isn’t now for the threat to American sovereignty caused by Biden’s feckless border policy and the violent reaction to efforts to rectify it, dangers just as grave as Alabama civil rights scofflaws were a half century ago. In both cases, protests threatened to derail the enforcement of federal law.', 'And while Newsom says the National Guard is an unneeded provocation, the LA police chief has had second thoughts. “Looking at the violence today, I think we’ve got to make a reassessment,” Jim McDonnell, told The New York Times.', 'He’s right. The Guard hasn’t engaged with protestors yet, but they are an important backstop to the police who face not only local riots but the threat that others with broader anti-American agendas will come to take advantage of the chaos caused by the original timorous response from California law enforcement.', 'It is unclear what message rioters were sending by setting multiple Waymo taxis on fire in downtown LA, but it is surely clear that unmanned transportation isn’t exactly a symbol of Trump administration overreach. Maybe the violent protestors have more in mind than a confrontation over immigration enforcement. That was certainly the case in the violent riots over the murder of George Floyd that killed nine and cost billions.', 'I have my problems with the Trump approach to immigration. Afghan patriots who served our military in trying to tame that terrorist-infested land deserve our thanks, not the boot. The U.S. has a long history of welcoming those who flee communism. Why that doesn’t apply to Venezuelans, I don’t know. Kicking out either group seems kinda dumb. And the policy of refusing to allow China to send full-fair paying students to our schools to subsidize American students’ education doesn’t make much fiscal sense to me.', 'But if America is to return to its roots as a land built on exploiting the hard work, innovations and and entrepreneurialism of wave after wave of migrants, we have to have a reckoning over the lawlessness of the Biden years. It might get ugly in some cases, but in trying his best to kick out undocumented immigrants, Trump is only doing what we elected him for.

Hegseth wrote that the “National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with [Immigration and Customs Enforcement],” whose immigration raids in California sparked the protests Friday. Trump, in his late-night posting spree, said Newsom—a longtime political foil—and LA Mayor Karen Bass were doing a “horrible job”: “These are not protests, they are troublemakers and insurrectionists,” added Trump, who had a notably more positive view of those who rioted in his name at the Capitol four years ago.

He defiantly challenged Tom Homan, the acting director of ICE, calling him a “tough guy” and daring him to arrest him for standing in the way of deporting undocumented residents — language that exceeds his resistance-era rhetoric from Trump’s first term.', 'The symbolism is unmistakable: Federal troops are on California soil, deployed against the governor’s will, to suppress protests against immigration law enforcement. This is precisely the scenario that transforms moderate politicians into resistance leaders... provided they expect to survive politically.', 'On the social media platform, X, Newsom was defiant: “Californians pay the bills for the federal government. We pay over $80 BILLION more in taxes than we get back. Maybe it’s time to cut that off” — a line that would have been unthinkable during his brief foray into centrist podcasting just weeks ago.', 'Newsom’s return to resistance leadership isn’t just politically inevitable — it’s constitutionally necessary.', 'Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, herself a key target of the administration’s ire, has already characterized the federal actions as an “intentional effort to sow chaos,” while local law enforcement has distanced itself from federal immigration operations.', 'On the first day of National Guard deployment, the Democratic Governors Association issued a statement signed by all of the states represented by Democratic Governors. “We stand with Governor Newsom, who has made it clear that violence is unacceptable and that local authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation,” the statement said.', 'As the only governor mentioned by his colleagues, it would appear that Newsom has had the national lead role of the resistance thrust upon him. Ironically, he consolidated a wide swath of Democratic primary voters when he first ran for Governor in 2018, running on “the opportunity to elect the next head of the resistance” and governing as “the resistance with results” during Trump’s first term.', 'But a governor cannot host friendly podcasts with right-wing figures while federal troops patrol his state’s largest city.', 'He cannot pursue centrist positioning while the federal government threatens to defund his state’s university system.', 'He cannot continue to govern effectively even in the deepest of large blue states when the conservative media eco-system has surpassed the reach of legacy media and traditional newspapers and television news shows — a fact he learned all too well during the fires that swept through Los Angeles earlier this year.', 'Newsom’s forced return to resistance leadership, however reluctant he might be, may strengthen his long-term political prospects.

The Democrat dared the administration to arrest him on Sunday. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, said on Monday that there were currently “no discussion” about arresting the governor, but didn’t close the door on the idea. Trump flung it wide open, however, telling reporters on Monday that he thinks arresting Newsom would be “great.”', '“I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great. Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. He’s done a terrible job,” the president said.', 'Newsom quickly responded. “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor,” he wrote on X. “This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation — this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”', '', 'Newsom said earlier on Monday that the state will sue Trump over his federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Trump “flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,” Newsom wrote. “The order he signed doesn’t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We’re suing him.”', 'Trump signed an order on Saturday authorizing the federalization and deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops, 300 of which were promptly sent to Los Angeles without the request or consent of city and state officials. The action hasn’t been taken by an American president since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson bypassed Alabama’s segregationist Governor George Wallace and sent the National Guard to protect civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. ', '', 'Trump’s order invoked Title X, and called the National Guard — typically under the control of state governors — into federal service “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” ', '', 'The order does not mention California, but instead directs the National Guard “to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” In effect, the order could be invoked in other states. Unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act, the National Guard would be barred from conducting law enforcement activities against U.S. citizens. ', '“Let’s be very clear, there was no risk of rebellion, no threat of foreign invasion, no inability for the federal government to enforce federal laws,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a Monday press conference. ', 'Bonta affirmed that his office would be pursuing a lawsuit to declare the president’s unilateral commandeering of the National Guard as unlawful. “The Trump administration likes to ignore laws and just barrel forward. We like to follow the laws and go through the process, including going to court to secure a court order,” he said. Bonta explained that the state decided to persue a legal solution instead of issuing counter-orders to the National Guard in order to avoid confusion. “They’d be getting two orders from two of their bosses, so to speak […] we think the appropriate way is to get a clear order from the court saying that Trump’s actions were unlawful.”', '“The governor is in charge […] unless there is an appropriate invocation of a legal authority by the President to exert authority with respect to deploying the National Guard. He has not done that here,” Bonta added. “The court should be declaring that Governor Newsom has the command here, not President Trump. I think that needs to come from a court, not just from the governor saying it.”', '', 'On Monday morning, the president further escalated the situation, advocating in a Truth Social post to “BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” in order to quash the protests. The threat to send active duty members of the military into L.A. has been echoed by prominent Republicans and Cabinet officials, while heightening tensions in the city. Trump later claimed that Los Angeles would be “completely obliterated” if he had not sent in the National Guard.', '', '“Donald Trump has created the conditions you see on your TV tonight,” Newsom said in a Sunday night interview with MSNBC. “He’s exacerbated the conditions, he’s lit the proverbial match, he’s putting fuel on this fire, ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard — an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.” ', 'We want to hear it.
