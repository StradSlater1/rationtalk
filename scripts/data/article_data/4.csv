"Duckworth, Colleagues Demand Answers on Cost and Justification for Un-American Transgender Military Ban That Will Harm National Security",https://www.riverbender.com/news/details/duckworth-colleagues-demand-answers-on-cost-and-justification-for-unamerican-transgender-military-ban-that-will-harm-national-security-83216.cfm,"['U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Combat Veteran and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL)—today led 22 of her fellow Senate Democratic colleagues in urging Defense Secretary Hegseth to reverse course and not implement the Trump Administration’s un-American transgender military service ban that will unfairly attack honorable servicemembers for who they are, compromise good order and discipline and jeopardize our national security. In the Senators’ letter, the group demands answers from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—including what specific data is being used to back up their claim that transgender servicemembers are not in the “interests of national security” and how much it will cost taxpayers to train the replacements of perfectly capable transgender servicemembers that they are forcing out of our military. After Senator Duckworth led over a dozen of her colleagues in April pushing back against the ban, Secretary Hegseth’s response to their letter did not answer many of the questions that were asked about the short- and long-term impacts of the ban on servicemembers, readiness and national security as well as taxpayer cost and more.', '“Transgender servicemembers are not political props; they are patriotic Americans serving honorably,” wrote the Senators. “Banning them from service will compromise good order and discipline, take deployable servicemembers out of the fight and create national security risks felt for years to come. Your recent implementation guidance makes matters worse.”', '', ""Don't miss our top stories and need-to-know news everyday in your inbox."", '', 'Additionally, the lawmakers admonished the Trump Administration’s latest guidance for implementing the ban, which requires military commanders to report servicemembers in their unit who they think display any signs of gender dysphoria.', '“By stating that unit commanders ‘will direct’ reviews of the medical records of servicemembers under their command, despite the fact that they are not equipped to do so, you are requiring them to perform a duty—for purely political reasons—that is far outside the scope of their normal operational and warfighting-centric responsibilities,” continued the Senators. “This burden is corrosive to unit cohesion, trust and the wellbeing of the servicemember and the commanders, who are being failed by their chain of command. This is not leadership.”', 'In conclusion, the lawmakers’ wrote: “Your policy will harm our armed services’ operational readiness and lethality, not only endangering Americans, but costing billions of dollars in taxpayer money in service of a political stunt meant to attack a small, extraordinarily brave group of people. Servicemembers’ privacy is being invaded, their livelihoods are being threatened and they are being used as a political tool to appeal to a minority of Americans.”', '“Mr. Secretary, do not implement this ban.”', 'In addition to Duckworth, the letter is co-signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Fetterman (D-PA), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).', 'The letter is endorsed by SPARTA, Modern Military Association of America, Minority Veterans of America and Out in National Security.', '', '', '', 'The full text of the letter is available on Senator Duckworth’s website and below:', 'Secretary Hegseth:', 'We write to express our ongoing opposition to the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) destructive and foolhardy ban on transgender servicemembers, as outlined in the May 15, 2025, memorandum entitled “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness: Implementation Guidance.” We have already written to condemn the ban itself. Transgender servicemembers are not political props; they are patriotic Americans serving honorably. Banning them from service will compromise good order and discipline, take deployable servicemembers out of the fight and create national security risks felt for years to come. Your recent implementation guidance makes matters worse.', 'The May 15th memorandum compromises commanders by making them informers on their own troops in areas outside of their expertise. Per that guidance, commanders of servicemembers who, in their judgment, display “gender dysphoria, a history of gender dysphoria, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria will direct individualized medical record reviews of such Service members.” Generally, commanders are not trained in medicine, psychology or mental health and are therefore not qualified to assess the members of their units for symptoms of mental health diagnoses. By stating that unit commanders “will direct” reviews of the medical records of servicemembers under their command, despite the fact that they are not equipped to do so, you are requiring them to perform a duty—for purely political reasons—that is far outside the scope of their normal operational and warfighting-centric responsibilities. This burden is corrosive to unit cohesion, trust and the wellbeing of the servicemember and the commanders, who are being failed by their chain of command. This is not leadership.', 'Additionally, the Department’s discharge guidance punishes those who have volunteered to serve. The guidance, which mandates separating transgender officers using the JDK separation code “on the basis that their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security,” is unjustifiable. There is ample evidence that these servicemembers, many of whom are decorated with years of honorable service and all or nearly all of whom are otherwise deployable, are assets to their units and to the force. Your DoD has failed to produce any meaningful evidence to suggest otherwise, much less to prove that transgender servicemembers threaten national security. Using this discharge code is not only cruel; it’s stupid. Beyond insulting brave individuals who have sacrificed to serve their country, this further ensures that the DoD or other security agencies will not be able to hire these individuals in a civilian capacity, robbing the national security establishment that protects everyday Americans of any opportunity to benefit from the skills and expertise these unreasonably separated servicemembers have gained at great expense to the taxpayer.', 'Beyond those process failures, your last response declined to answer several critical questions, answers to which are vital for Congress’ ability to oversee your Department. Ongoing litigation is no excuse; the taxpayers have a right to know your reasons and evidence. Please explain:', '', 'We trust that you will either include copies of all such reports, briefs or findings with your response, or specify that no such evidence exists.', 'Your policy will harm our armed services’ operational readiness and lethality, not only endangering Americans, but costing billions of dollars in taxpayer money in service of a political stunt meant to attack a small, extraordinarily brave group of people. Servicemembers’ privacy is being invaded, their livelihoods are being threatened and they are being used as a political tool to appeal to a minority of Americans.', 'Mr. Secretary, do not implement this ban.', '', '', ' ', 'What are your thoughts?

The Department of Defense estimates that there are more than 4,000 transgender troops currently serving. A defense official told NPR that a question is being added to the annual physical, asking whether someone has exhibited gender dysphoria. That's the diagnosis the Pentagon uses to determine whether someone is considered transgender. Commanders can also refer someone for a medical evaluation. After that, they will go through the administrative separation process. The Pentagon is also ordering that personnel records be changed to reflect a person's birth sex. Ellis says she will stay in the Virginia National Guard through the involuntary separation process."", ""ELLIS: I want them to put it in writing and tell me why I'm no longer qualified, right next to all of my qualifications. Right? Like, that's my piece to all of this, is that I'm going to go out on my feet and stay until the very end."", ""WALSH: When the services add up the true cost of removing experienced personnel, Ellis says if the ban does happen, she thinks eventually they'll be asked to come back."", ""ELLIS: I'd be up for it because I know it's not the Virginia National Guard doing this to me. This is coming from a very politicized process. There's still a majority of people that think we should be able to serve in the country. There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for."", ""WALSH: At least two lawsuits challenging the Pentagon policy are making their way through the courts. In the meantime, one Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill that would make it illegal for transgender troops to serve.

Army document outlines plans for expelling transgender troops from military,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/army-transgender-troops-expel-guidelines/,"['Watch CBS News', 'Updated on: May 31, 2025 / 8:50 AM EDT / CBS News', 'Washington — Transgender military service members must come forward and voluntarily leave active-duty service next week, by June 6, according to Defense Department guidance issued by Secretary Pete Hegseth. After that, the military is expected to begin involuntary separations for active-duty trans service members who remain. ', 'One of the service branches, the Army, on Wednesday issued more guidance about how it will identify and interact with soldiers with gender dysphoria, according to documents obtained by CBS News. ', ""Although Hegseth had made formal assurances in a February memo that transgender service members would be treated with dignity, the Army's new internal directives to units instruct personnel to intentionally address transgender troops — even superior officers — in accordance with an individual's medical assignment at birth rather than by their preferred pronoun. "", 'When the military starts forcing out transgender troops through involuntary separations, soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria following a list of criteria outlined in the guidance. The markers include past requests for grooming standard exemptions tied to medical assignment at birth or the initiation of a medical treatment plan tied to gender dysphoria. ""Overt conduct,"" either on social media or in person, of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth and even a commander\'s ""private conversation"" where a soldier disclosed gender dysphoria are considered relevant under the guidance. ', ""The commander is expected to initiate a medical record review if aware of any of the criteria above, and service members will also be asked during routine medical check-ups about their identity as a result of the Defense Department's new policy. "", 'In a February memo filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said transgender troops will be ""treated with dignity and respect."" But in public, the Army veteran and former Fox News host has instead railed against transgender service members, saying at a Special Operations Forces military conference in Florida in May, ""No more dudes in dresses, we\'re done with that s***."" ', 'The Army guidance also instructs soldiers to use the ""utmost professionalism and treating all individuals with dignity and respect,"" but the policies run counter to transgender social norms, like addressing transgender troops by the pronouns they prefer. ', 'Army Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer and Afghanistan veteran with 17 years of military service, now faces separation from the armed forces. She defended the service of transgender troops when contacted Friday by CBS News. ', '""By implementing this guidance…you\'re making it worse than the \'Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell\' policy, because you\'re overtly hunting down and trying to identify transgender service members or anybody that…exhibits symptoms of gender dysphoria,"" Corcoran said. ', 'She added: ""Transgender service members have served openly since 2016 without adverse impacts on readiness or unit cohesion. Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having deployed to war zones and executed missions with distinction.""', 'The Defense Department defines gender dysphoria as a ""marked incongruence between an individual\'s experienced or expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least six months, as manifested by conditions causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."" ', 'The Army guidance issued to units on Wednesday begins with the suggestion that identifying with a gender different from one\'s sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members — even beyond the uniform they wear. The guidance echoes the statements in President Trump\'s January executive order stating the values of transgender service members represent a departure from the ""humility and selflessness required"" of military members and are ""inconsistent with"" the ""cohesion"" the armed forces demand. ', 'Contacted by CBS News on Thursday, an Army spokesperson at the Pentagon said that since May 8, additional guidance has been issued as the service continues to voluntarily separate service members. ', 'When asked about soldiers being directed to misgender transgender soldiers, the Army spokesman, who did not want to be identified while speaking on behalf of the service, repeated what was in the guidance obtained by CBS News: ""Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as ""sir"" or ""ma\'am"") must also reflect an individual\'s biological sex.""', 'The Army spokesman added, ""The Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation. We are in the process of ensuring the Army is aligned with recent policy changes to Soldier requirements. Regardless of potential outcomes, every Soldier will be treated with dignity and respect.""', ""Commanders have also been instructed to revise official records to reflect service members' sex at birth, rather than their gender identity. In the interim, transgender troops are expected to comply with policies aligned with biological sex—ranging from physical fitness standards to uniform requirements, sleeping quarters and access to restrooms and showers. "", 'Under current policy, decisions to separate soldiers outside standard regulatory grounds rest solely with the secretary of the Army — a power typically reserved for exceptional circumstances. Enlisted transgender soldiers will be separated under the Secretarial Plenary Authority, a mechanism the Army itself acknowledges is ""exercised sparingly."" Historically, this little-used authority has surfaced during politically fraught chapters of military policy — from discharges over COVID-19 mandate refusals to the now-defunct ""Don\'t ask, Don\'t Tell"" era. ', 'While both enlisted and officer transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge unless their service warrants a lower characterization, they will also receive an RE-3 enlistment code, meaning they are not eligible to rejoin the Army or any other U.S. military service without a waiver. ', 'Army military officers will be separated on the basis that ""their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security."" CBS News has not yet seen directives from the other service branches and whether they mirror the Army\'s policies. ', 'Under the Army guidance obtained by CBS News, transgender officers will receive what\'s known as a ""Code JDK"" upon separation. The JDK code is for the Military Personnel Security Program, and is typically applied to discharge paperwork where a service member is being separated from the U.S. military for a security reason. ', 'Cody Harnish, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer and now a private defense attorney for U.S. service members, told CBS News by phone on Thursday that a JDK separation code is a red flag and signals to other government agencies that the service members were separated for ""national security interests."" ', '""This can be a serious roadblock to keeping or transferring a security clearance to future employment requiring a clearance,"" said Harnish. He said under President Trump\'s executive order revoking gender identity discrimination protections, if a transgender veteran\'s separation from the military bears this code and is vetted for a job requiring a security clearance, ""being transgender can again be viewed as a security concern."" ', 'Harnish said that having the JDK separation code on their record may be interpreted by future employers ""as evidence of heightened risk, severely complicating or blocking clearance maintenance or transfer after military service."" ', 'But amid the crackdown and political rhetoric surrounding the service of transgender service members, Maj. Corcoran offered a pointed reflection on patriotism, duty, and shared sacrifice.', '""It\'s simple, we transgender service members believe in the same American values you do—liberty and freedom,"" said Corcoran. ""The nation\'s strength comes together for a common purpose in the face of the ever-increasing hostile global environment. It is in the blood of the warrior spirit that we all stand ready to fight, and if need be, die in the defense of the cherished institutions of America. Let us embody this by serving.""

Marquez is still receiving cadet pay and medical benefits but is ineligible for veteran benefits due to the lack of a commission.', 'In the meantime, Marquez is applying to graduate school and hopes to attend the University of Colorado to study aerospace engineering.

New York continues fight over federal ban on transgender military service,https://www.rochesterfirst.com/state-politics/new-york-continues-fight-over-federal-ban-on-transgender-military-service/amp/,"['ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that the state is still fighting a federal rule stopping trans people from serving in the U.S. military. James and 21 other state attorneys general filed a legal document on May 30 asking a federal court to overturn the ban.', 'The current federal policy prevents any openly transgender individuals from joining or continuing their service in the armed forces. According to James, the policy is unfair, runs contrary to American principles, and threatens national security by removing skilled and dedicated service members.', '“Denying brave individuals the opportunity to serve our country because of their gender identity is not only discriminatory, it’s a disgrace,” James said in a written statement released June 2. “This ban weakens our military and contradicts the values of equality and fairness that we fight for every day.”', 'Transgender people are those whose internal understanding of being male, female, both, or neither—also known as their gender identity—differs from the gender they were assigned at birth. The medical term “gender dysphoria” describes the distress a transperson often feels because their gender identity does not align with their physical sex characteristics.', 'New York and the other states—Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia—are challenging the policy as unconstitutional in an amicus brief in the federal court case “Shilling v. Trump.” That legal filing—a “friend of the court” brief available to read at the bottom of this story—lets a person or entity that’s not directly part of a lawsuit provide the court information or arguments.', 'This legal challenge followed recent Pentagon directives aimed at identifying and removing transgender service members, a ban that would affect many New Yorkers. According to the brief, about 1,330 transgender New Yorkers currently serve on active duty in the U.S. military. And the policy led to military medical staff screening service members for gender dysphoria. Such a diagnosis can be grounds for removal from service under the current rules.', 'New York’s own laws protect against discrimination based on gender identity. The amicus brief points out that the federal ban conflicts with the state’s Human Rights Law, which “broadly prohibits such discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.” In the brief, the attorneys general also argued that a ban undermines state efforts to attract and retain qualified National Guard recruits by creating uncertainty for transgender service members and potential recruits.', 'The states claimed the ban discriminates against transgender individuals for no reason—or, without a valid, evidence-based one, at least. According to the brief, the ban pushes prejudice, relying on “discredited myths and stereotypes” about transpeople rather than on careful review of any data related to effective military service.', 'The states acknowledged that supporters justify such a ban with concerns about military effectiveness, the cost of medical treatments related to gender transition, and the ability of military units to work well together. But the attorneys general argued that such concerns are not supported by facts.', 'The brief points to military leaders and medical experts who have confirmed that open transgender military service has no negative impact on military readiness or unit cohesion. It specifically referenced a 2016 Department of Defense study finding that the costs of transition-related medical care would be “exceedingly small,” estimating an increase of only 0.04% to 0.13% in overall military healthcare expenses.', 'What’s more, the attorneys general aimed at the other economic impacts of forcing out trained and capable service members. They said that such unnecessary costs would include the loss of federal funding tied to military personnel and greater long-term healthcare costs for discharged trans veterans who lose military benefits.', 'Take a look at the brief below:']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWhVR0ZZY0VoQlRGWndZbGw2VFJDUEF4alhCQ2dLTWdhcFE1Q3VuUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Earlier this week, the Army alone had recorded about 700 requests for voluntary separation, a Pentagon official told CNN.

Transgender Troops Face Tough Decision As Deadline to Self-ID Looms ,https://www.airandspaceforces.com/transgender-troops-voluntary-separation-process/,"['Active-duty transgender troops have until June 6 to identify themselves and begin the voluntary separation process or wait and risk involuntary separation later—even as questions linger over how that decision might affect their security clearances for future employment.  ', 'The Pentagon announced the June 6 deadline on May 15. National Guard and Reserve members have until July 7. A senior defense official said at the time that the military departments must begin the separation process within 30 days after members identify themselves as transgender. ', 'It is unclear how many people may be affected by the order. In February, a senior defense official said there were 4,240 members serving who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and about 1,000 members had received gender-transition surgery since 2014. But how many of those are still serving is not known. Not all transgender troops are diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and only some who are choose to undergo surgery. ', '“I think everyone is trying to make the decision that they think is best for them and their situation, and they’re doing so in an extreme absence of information,” said Col. Bree Fram, a transgender Guardian who noted she was sharing her personal views and not speaking on behalf of the Space Force or the government.', 'Those who voluntarily self-identify are promised “a very significant voluntary separation pay, a covered permanent change of station move to their home of record” and an honorable discharge if there is no misconduct prompting the separation, the defense official said. Other resources, including financial counseling, temporary healthcare coverage, employment assistance, and the Transition Assistance Program, will remain available. ', 'But the process of ousting transgender troops may make it more difficult to land a job once out of uniform. The Pentagon will yank their access to SkillBridge, a program that funds internships, apprenticeships, and training in civilian organizations for Active troops for up to 180 days of service. When asked why, a separate defense official cited a May 15 memo, which specifically excluded SkillBridge because it “is a discretionary program,” meaning it is not required by law. ', 'The senior defense official said troops who separate voluntarily will receive double the payment compared to those who separate involuntarily. For example, an E-5 with 10 years of service would receive about $101,000 for a voluntary separation compared to $51,000 in involuntary separation pay; an O-3 with seven years would receive about $125,000 in voluntary separation pay, but only about $62,000 if separated involuntarily. ', 'The memo states that the military branches will check that troops who ask to leave under the policy have a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or a history of that diagnosis, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria.', 'For members who do not self-identify, however, the memo states that “the primary method of identifying … [affected service members] who are no longer eligible for military service will be through compliance with the Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) program.” ', 'The assessment of medical readiness will be conducted through the DoD Periodic Health Assessment, which will include questions about whether service members have a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria or a history of that diagnosis, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. ', 'Gender dysphoria refers to the sometimes severe stress or anxiety people can feel if their gender identity does not match their sex at birth. It can be treated through behavioral changes, such as dress and mannerisms, or through medical interventions, such as hormone replacement therapy or gender-transition surgery. ', 'Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth contends that a history of gender dysphoria or transition treatment is incompatible with military service. Transgender troops have served openly since 2016. President Donald Trump moved to bar transgender troops during the Republican’s first term, though troops serving at the time were grandfathered in. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, lifted the ban on transgender recruits entering service when he took office in 2021.', 'Active-duty troops may apply for a waiver by June 6; Reservists and Guardsmen have until July 7. A person diagnosed with gender dysphoria who managed to serve without clinically significant distress and without attempting to transition could theoretically receive a waiver, but anyone who has attempted to transition is ineligible. ', 'The Air Force implementation plan includes one major difference from the DOD memo: It allows volunteers with 15 to 18 years of service to apply to retire early under the temporary early retirement authority. The Defense Department policy had limited that option to troops with more than 18 but less than 20 years of service to apply for TERA. ', 'Questions Remain ', 'Though the memos give transgender troops a deadline to self-identify, the services have not released in-depth policies on what the process looks like for involuntary separations. ', '“There is still the unknown of ‘what does it mean to be involuntarily separated?’” Fram said. ', 'The Defense Department said in February that “all service members affected by the policy will be separated with an honorable characterization of service, except where their record otherwise warrants a lower characterization.”  ', 'But troops who are involuntarily separated may not receive “certain benefits” available to those who separate voluntarily, the senior defense official said in May. They also may have to pay back bonus or incentive payments for which the required obligation has not been met.  ', 'Another complicating factor is the three-letter code listed on troops’ DD-214 discharge papers that signifies the reason for discharge. ', 'Pentagon guidance said the code for enlisted troops separated under the policy will be “JFF,” meaning the discharge was directed by the defense secretary’s authority. But officers “will be processed for separation on the basis that their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security using the JDK separation program designator code,” the guidance said. ', 'A JDK code would indicate the service member could not be trusted with national security matters, which presumably would make it difficult to retain or obtain a security clearance, said retired Air Force Col. Joshua Kastenberg, a former Air Force judge now teaching law at the University of New Mexico. ', '“If someone wants to go into classified work, it’s huge,” he said. “Keep in mind that people who leave the military honorably, some of them want to find jobs with contractors that require a clearance because they pay well and it gives them an opportunity to serve national defense without having to put on a uniform. That door may be shut to them as a result of this.” ', 'Asked about the JDK code, a Defense Department official said “the separation code alone does not infer a revocation of a security clearance.” The official could not answer in time whether the JDK code would apply to all officers who are separated under the policy, or just those separated involuntarily. ', 'Transgender troops must now comply with the dress, grooming, and fitness standards of their birth sex, which might not be possible for some service members at this point in their transition. Especially in question is the status of those transgender members whose gender data was changed in military personnel systems. Fram said she has heard anecdotally that some transgender members have been placed on administrative leave since they would not be able to adhere to the standards of their birth sex. ', 'The unknowns mean some transgender service members are taking the voluntary separation option “as the best of bad choices,” Fram said. “But to be clear, it is not voluntary. These people would be continuing to serve if the circumstances were different. They are avoiding the threat of further unknown consequences.”  ', 'Two lawsuits challenging the policy change are still being litigated, but the Supreme Court last month overturned an injunction that would have kept transgender troops in uniform until the cases were settled. That process could take years, and Kastenberg doubts it will end favorably for plaintiffs, since there is no statute barring the military from discriminating based on gender identity. ', 'The Pentagon memo directs commanders aware of troops with a diagnosis, a history of, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria to refer them to the medical review process. Fram worried that policy could be used against troops “just outside what people expect, particularly in women who may be more masculine than what others expect,” and Kastenberg shared her concern.', 'When asked if there would be safeguards to prevent misuse of the policy, the senior defense official told reporters in May that the military “has long granted broad discretion and authority to commanders . . . and so, this policy, like many others, will rely on their qualifications, discernment and judgment in how to interpret and apply the guidance.” ', ""Get your daily fix of Air & Space Force news delivered right to your inbox every day.
