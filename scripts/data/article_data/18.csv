What we now need to do is to work out what is coming next and how that impacts upon Northern Ireland.', 'Speaking to the media, Mr Lyons said it was “good news” that the Government had listened to concerns over its policy.', 'He said: “It is right that they have had a think again on this.

Reeves and Cooper forced into U-turn over pensioner fuel payments,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-yvette-cooper-news-fdbd322mc,"['Now showing content from the last twelve months, not just the past six days.', 'The U-turn, when it came, was even bigger than expected. Rachel Reeves decided to clear the decks before the spending review by announcing that nine million pensioners would receive winter fuel payments this winter.', 'It was a move born of political \xadnecessity and that has little fiscal logic. When the chancellor announced that she was stripping ten million pensioners of the winter fuel allowance next year, she argued that it was fundamental to restoring economic stability.', '“This is not a decision I wanted to make,” she said. “Nor is it one that I \xadexpected to make. But these are the necessary and urgent decisions I must make. It is the responsible thing to do to fix the foundations of our economy and bring back economic stability.”', 'On Tuesday, economists point out that the fiscal circumstances are, if anything, significantly worse.', 'The reversal means that a policy \xadintended to save £1.5 billion will now save only £50 million this year, at the expense of huge reserves of public goodwill and political capital. It will \xadonly add to pressure on the already \xadailing public finances.', 'Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the decision meant there would have to be tax rises or more cuts to welfare in the autumn budget. “To suggest the fiscal situation has got a lot better flies in the face of reality,” he said. “If they are saying this means there will not be any additional borrowing then it follows, as sure as night follows day, that this will mean they will need to raise the equivalent of an additional amount of tax.”', 'It also means that Reeves has crossed another line. She had insisted that she would never make an unfunded \xadspending pledge, arguing that to do so would be “desperate and reckless”. That is exactly what she has now done, and the detail of how the about-turn will be paid for will be confirmed in the autumn budget.', 'After the announcement on Monday, Reeves found herself trying to argue that she had been right in scrapping the universal payments in the first place while simultaneously trying to justify the change in position. It was not an easy circle to square.', 'The decision was the result of a \xadrecognition in both No 10 and No 11 that cutting the allowance had been a \xadmistake, although Reeves would not \xadacknowledge that on Monday.', 'During the local elections in May, \xadLabour activists found the issue of \xadwinter fuel coming up again and again on the doorstep. Polling found that the decision was one of the main reasons voters deserted the party, whether they moved to Reform UK or to the Greens.', '• What to expect in Rachel Reeves’s spend, spend, spending review', 'Discussion about a reversal began in No 10 almost immediately, but was \xaddenied for weeks by the government. By the time Sir Keir Starmer was \xadconfronted over the “toxic” policy by a succession of angry MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party three weeks ago, it was clear that the position was beginning to shift.', 'However, concern that there was a lack of detail about what would replace the previous policy quickly made clear that the government could not wait long before setting out a replacement. Ministers were determined to introduce a means test to avoid paying “a few hundred pounds to millionaires”, and officials struggled to graft one on to ageing computer systems in the \xadDepartment for Work and Pensions.', 'Eventually, it became clear that HM Revenue & Customs would have to be used, clawing payments back from wealthier pensioners through the tax system. This meant that a wish to base payments on household incomes had to be abandoned, as the system assesses only individual incomes.', 'Ministers picked a relatively high \xadincome, covering three quarters of \xadpensioners, to make sure that no older people in poverty would lose out even at the cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.', 'Theoretically, this means that the pensioner partner of a millionaire will receive a winter fuel payment of £100 if they have an income below £35,000 themselves, but ministers \xaddecided that this was a price worth \xadpaying for a rapid solution.', 'For ministers who have spent months defending hugely unpopular cuts, there has been frustration about how much political capital was wasted for such tiny sums of money.', '• Rachel Reeves’s winter fuel cut reversal is a sign of desperation', 'Much of the blame is being pinned on Reeves. It was she who chose to press ahead with a cut long recommended by Treasury advisers but rejected as politically toxic by a succession of previous chancellors.', 'Starmer nodded the decision through, however, despite the clear risk of a severe political backlash. He is said to have been surprised by the scale of the reaction.', 'Ministers will be hoping that the turnaround is enough to quell public anger, which led Labour to slump in the polls.', 'Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, one of Labour’s biggest donors, put it bluntly. “While this is an important step forward, questions will be asked about how this disastrous \xaddecision was made in the first place — the damage may not easily be \xadreversed,” she said. “Leadership is about choices and the choice to pit workers against pensioners was simply wrong.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.

The same, one minister tells me, is true of Rachel Reeves and winter fuel payments.', 'Two days before her first Spending Review (which I preview here), Reeves has announced that winter fuel payments will be restored to three-quarters of pensioners (or all those earning below £35,000). The Chancellor wants to use the event to tell a story of pro-growth investment and dispel accusations of austerity – hence this advance U-turn. ', 'As I reported last August, plenty inside government always feared that the original £11,500 earnings threshold – above which the £200-£300 benefit was withdrawn – was too brutal. So it proved. MPs began referring to the policy as Labour’s “original sin” and it was blamed for the party’s dismal performance in the local elections and its defeat to Reform in the Runcorn by-election. ', 'Though Reeves long defended the measure as an emblem of fiscal discipline, the Chancellor herself came to conclude that it was untenable (cabinet colleagues such as Ed Miliband and Liz Kendall had doubts from the start). ', 'Reeves is now making the argument that some new Labour MPs wanted her to deliver from the start: that it is “fair” to withdraw the benefit from the “wealthiest” pensioners (two million earn over £35,000). Such a framing could have opened up a conversation around generational inequality but the policy was instead justified narrowly as a response to the Conservatives’ “£22bn black hole” or an offering to the bond vigilantes.', 'Even now, some inside government fear that an opportunity has been missed to make a values-based argument. Here, for instance, is how Gordon Brown explained his U-turn over the abolition of the 10p income tax rate in 2008. “It really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn’t on the side of people on middle and modest incomes – because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I’ve ever wanted to be,” he said. “And from now on it’s the only place I ever will be.”', 'But Reeves avoided such a moral narrative today, leaving Labour open to the charge that it has merely U-turned out of political expediency. In recent weeks she and Starmer have also sought to tie the move to an improving economy – growth of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter – yet this creates an additional headache: renewed pressure to reverse other measures (such as the health and disability benefit cuts) even as debt continues to rise. ', 'The winter fuel episode ultimately left Labour looking both unfair and weak, a deadly combination for any government. For Reeves, the test is whether she can now escape from her own history and use this moment to reset her Chancellorship.', '', '', '', 'Related']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNW1TRVp6UW1oeE5UaDFVRFZNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZcFZaU3VKUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

or even lower - a gap of at least £1bn will open up in the government's finances."", 'The Treasury said it will address this gap in the next Budget in the Autumn of 2025 and said ""it will not lead to permanent additional borrowing"".', 'Assuming the OBR does not raise its GDP growth and tax revenue forecasts in the Budget, giving the government more money to fill the gap, this will imply ministers would either have to raise additional taxes or cut spending elsewhere to close this roughly £1bn gap .', 'However, it should be noted that £1bn is a relatively low sum in the context of the public finances.', 'In 2025-26 the government is projected by the OBR to spend £1,347bn and to borrow £129bn.', ""It is also worth noting that the projected savings from the government's working age welfare reforms, announced earlier this year, are considerably higher than the savings from changing eligibility for winter fuel payments."", 'The changes in eligibility for personal independence payments and the cuts to universal credit incapacity payments are projected by the OBR to save the government £4.8bn a year by 2029-30.', 'If the government were to reverse or water down those reforms, as some Labour MPs are urging, it would create a considerably larger financial headache for the chancellor in terms of meeting her fiscal rules.', ""Those rules specify that she has to be projected to be on course to balance the government's day-to-day spending budget (which excludes spending on infrastructure) by 2029-30."", 'In March 2025, the OBR projected that she had just £9.9bn of ""headroom"" against this rule, a very small amount of leeway given the size of overall government spending and borrowing.', 'Reversing the welfare cuts would wipe out around half of it.', ""And many economists expect the chancellor's projected headroom to be further eroded by the OBR in any case in the Autumn Budget as a result of downgraded growth forecasts and an increase in government market borrowing costs in recent months."", 'What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

certain benefits, such as pension credit.', 'Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, warned ministers they risked making a “similar mistake” if they tighten the eligibility criteria for

For those on the old basic state pension - which pays a maximum of £176.45 per week, even with a full National Insurance record - this could boost your weekly income to nearly the same level as a state pensioner on the new post-2016 state pension (Pension Credit is £227.10, but the full new pension is just a few pounds more at £230.25), reports the Express.', 'But there is another eligibility criterion besides weekly income: savings. If your savings exceed £10,000, your Pension Credit eligibility will be reduced by £1 for every £500 of savings you have above the £10,000 threshold.', 'The government\'s gov.uk site sets out: ""If you have £10,000 or less in savings and investments this will not affect your Pension Credit.', '""If you have more than £10,000, every £500 over £10,000 counts as £1 income a week. For example, if you have £11,000 in savings, this counts as £2 income a week.""', 'This means that if your savings exceed a certain amount, you may be disqualified from receiving Pension Credit, which in turn makes you ineligible for a winter fuel payment (since claiming Pension Credit is a prerequisite for the winter fuel payment).', 'Although there is no absolute limit on how much you can save, take for instance you have £110,000 tucked away; with £100,000 over the £10,000 mark, this would convert to an additional £200 per week when calculated at increments of £500.', 'Suppose you also receive £176.45 weekly as your state pension, your total weekly income would amount to £376.45, making you ineligible for both Pension Credit and consequently, the winter fuel payment. Remember, individual circumstances can vary – factors such as your specific state pension sum, based on your National Insurance record, will play a part alongside your savings and any other income in determining your eligibility.', 'Certain types of income are exempt in these assessments, including Attendance Allowance, Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Disability Living Allowance, and some other Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits, along with adoption or fostering allowances, the income of a dependant child or payments from Scottish Carers Allowance Supplement.', 'READ NEXT:', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNW1TRVp6UW1oeE5UaDFVRFZNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZcFZaU3VKUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

That went well, didn’t it? One of the first things Labour did after winning the election was to cut the winter fuel allowance (WFA) for most pensioners. To show that they were strong. A signal to the bond markets that they would take the tough decisions to balance the Treasury books.', 'And it was just one of those things if a handful of old people decided to die of hypothermia. They were dying in a good cause. Pour encourager les autres. Let no one take being warm for granted again. Time for some proper pensioner gratitude.', 'After that, things started to unravel. MPs on all sides of the house – not least the Labour benches – began to ask whether this was the sort of policy a Labour government, any government come to think of it, ought to be introducing.', 'Hell, the Tories had tried starving them with a cost of living crisis and now this? Rachel Reeves unconvincingly said the real aim was to make sure all those eligible for pension credit had claimed it but there would be no U-turns.', 'Then came the U-turn. Two and a half weeks ago at prime minister’s questions, Keir Starmer announced the reverse ferret. Something that everyone other than Kemi Badenoch heard clearly. Kemi isn’t the quickest on the uptake.', 'Now, on Monday morning – a couple of days before the spending review – came the details from the Treasury. Any pensioner with an income of under £35,000 would now be entitled to the WFA, starting this winter.', 'Genius. It would be hard to create a bigger cock-up if you tried. Not just the denials of the U-turn followed by the inevitable U-turn. But the logistics. With the extra 100,000 people claiming pensioner credit, Labour has ended up with a bigger spending bill than if it had left the WFA as it was.', 'Plus it has managed to dent its own economic credibility by not being able to explain how the £1.3bn extra cost will be paid for. Wait until the budget, we are told. Only just a few weeks ago, Reeves said she would live or die by balancing the books.', 'The chancellor was out and about in north London trying to smooth things over on Monday lunchtime. When is a U-turn not a U-turn? When it’s a Rachel U-turn. It was like this. She had originally made the spending cut to partially fill the black hole in the country’s finances. Just one of those things.', 'But then she had miraculously found that the economy was doing far better than expected so she was able to reverse her decision. She couldn’t say how the country was doing better – she has yet to find anyone to back up this suggestion – but we should take her word for it.', 'Any connection to the withdrawal of the WFA being unpopular was a coincidence. She was sorry but not sorry. Yeahbutnobutyeahbutno. Everywhere she went, lay the telltale sounds of burnt rubber.', 'You could tell that Rachel wasn’t having one of her best days. She looked confused. Embarrassed even. As if she couldn’t quite believe some of the nonsense coming out of her mouth. A feeling confirmed by the fact she was nowhere to be seen when it was time for her to make a statement to the Commons. She had just checked her diary and had found there was a flurry of subsequent engagements.', 'Nor was anyone else senior in the Treasury to be found to take her place. They too had found themselves unavoidably detained elsewhere. Appointments at the doctor. Unexpected open heart surgery. Anything. Any excuse will do. “I’ve got a very important lunch. I can’t cancel.” “But the statement isn’t until 4.15.” “Ah, but it’s a very long lunch. And then I have a coffee.”', 'What goes around, comes around. In his time as head of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell would have had a thing or two to say about the cuts to the WFA. None of them good. There was a Torsten once who didn’t think killing pensioners was a good idea. But that Torsten was very much last year’s Torsten. He has moved on since then. Wised up.', 'But when he became a fresh-faced MP last year – Torsten looks about 12 – he was immediately promoted to the most junior role in the Treasury. One step up from the receptionist. So there was an air of inevitability when he was forced to take Rachel’s place.', 'Luckily, Torsten is hopelessly naive. Thinks there is an air of nobility in being made to look a halfwit. It’s as if he was yet another ego straight out of Oxford who believes that he was born to rule. That the union was just a stepping stone to a life that will probably end up in the House of Lords. Monday was just a staging post.', 'It’s a brilliance that was almost entirely self-imagined. He managed to turn what was always going to be an embarrassment into a humiliation. All ersatz macho posture as he tried to pretend the U-turn was a clever piece of government time management.', 'Hell, he even managed to make the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, Helen Whately, look good. Something that never happens. She was prone to her own delusions – namely that it was the Tories that had forced the U-turn – but her main point was unarguable. Why no apology? Just say sorry. You’ve fucked things up, you’re trying to fix it, let’s move on. The story might then go away. But Torsten didn’t apologise. Choosing instead to bluster for more than an hour. The kindest thing to do was to look away.', 'Down in Port Talbot, Nigel Farage was also trying to take the credit for the U-turn. Though he was also trying to make it sound completely normal for someone to walk out of their job one day and walk back in the next. Zia Yusuf must be thrilled to be talked of as a temperamental teenager who had got cross with Daddy. Nige also observed that Yusuf had suffered loads of racist abuse. He forgot to mention that almost all of it had come from Reform UK supporters.', 'Mostly, though, Farage was keen to reopen the steelworks that can’t be opened to make a type of steel we don’t use and to reopen the coalmines so that all those former miners who swore blind they wanted their kids to never go down the pits could tell their kids to do just that.

After the change, 9 million pensioners will benefit this winter.', 'The government’s reversal came despite Downing Street denying it would make changes to winter fuel payments after the Guardian revealed that it was rethinking the cut amid anxiety at the top of government that the policy could wreak serious electoral damage.', 'The decision to prioritise paying the energy bills of some middle-class pensioners bolstered Labour MPs who have been urging the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which could lift an estimated 350,000 children out of poverty.', 'Torsten Bell, the pensions minister, suggested that the current rules, which limit benefit payments for families with more than two children, were not sustainable. “We cannot carry on with a situation where large families, huge percentages of them, are in poverty,” he told MPs.', 'Economists questioned whether the government had focused on the right issue. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “It wouldn’t even be in the top 100 of things that I would do with my £1.25bn if I wanted to act on poverty.', '“Almost none of the people impacted by this will be in poverty. Most of them will be at least as well-off as the average in the population. We know that poverty is much worse among families with children than it is with pensioners.”', 'Reeves brought forward confirmation of the change to the £11,500 income threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible to the spending review on Wednesday.

However, it was unclear whether the figure took into account tens of thousands more people now claiming pension credit, cancelling out any savings.', 'Helen Whately, the Tories’ pensions spokesperson, urged Reeves to apologise to pensioners. “Let’s be clear, the government made a choice to cut the winter fuel payment. It is outrageous to claim that the economy has somehow improved since the day they made the cut,” she said.', 'However, the chancellor defended the move. “Targeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,” she said. “It is also right that we continue to means test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.”', 'Party activists said the chancellor’s decision to axe £1.5bn in winter fuel payments last July came up repeatedly on the doorstep during last month’s local elections. No 10 officials feared the strength of feeling could have an impact on their broader welfare plans, with previously loyal backbenchers threatening to rebel.', 'The option of paying all pensioners a winter fuel payment and then asking wealthier people to repay the money is a similar approach to that taken by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne when he reduced child benefit eligibility for better-off parents.', 'Pensioners will also be able to opt out of receiving the payments, with about 2 million individuals in England and Wales over state pension age having taxable incomes above £35,000. The Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive will both receive an increase in their funding as a result of the change in England and Wales.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNW1TRVp6UW1oeE5UaDFVRFZNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZcFZaU3VKUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

It says:', 'The costs will be accounted for at the budget and incorporated into the next OBR forecast. The chancellor will take decisions on funding in the round at that forecast to ensure the government’s non-negotiable fiscal rules are met. This will not lead to permanent additional borrowing.', 'Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says ‘no extra borrowing’ means ‘higher taxes, or welfare cuts’.', 'The corollary of “this will not lead to permanent additional borrowing” is that it will lead to permanent additional taxes (or just possibly permanent cuts to other bits of welfare).', 'All pensioners with an income of £35,000 or less a year will have the winter fuel payment restored in full, Rachel Reeves has announced, after weeks of uncertainty over the decision to make a U-turn on scrapping the benefit. The move was welcomed by all the main opposition parties in the Commons, although some said the government should have apologised for cutting the benefit in the first place last year. But, in a classic example of how political consensus at Westminster does not always overlap with what is seen by experts as wise policy making, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, told the PM programme that he did not think today’s announcement was a good one. He said he thought cutting the benefit last year was a “sensible” policy in the first place and that restoring the benefit for most pensioners in this manner was not a sound use of public money. He explained:', 'It wouldn’t even be in the top 100 of things that I would do with my £1.25bn if I wanted to act on poverty. Almost none of the people impacted by this will be in poverty. Most of them will be at least as well off as the average in the population.', 'We know that poverty is much worse among families with children than it is with pensioners, and of course the poorest pensioners are already getting this - they are covered through the pension credit system.', 'Johnson also said the net savings to the taxpayer would be “so small as to be barely visible.” But – crucially – he also admitted that the IFS does not have to stand for election.', 'Sadiq Khan is understood to be furious at the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over a lack of funding for London in the forthcoming spending review, with sources close to the mayor suggesting the capital will get none of its key transport requests.', 'Nigel Farage has demanded the reopening of domestic coalmines to provide fuel for new blast furnaces, arguing that Welsh people would happily return to mining if the pay was sufficiently high.', 'All civil servants in England and Wales will get practical training in how to use artificial intelligence to speed up their work from this autumn, the Guardian has learned.', 'For a full list of all the stories covered here today, scroll through the key events timeline at the top of the blog.', 'This is from Patrick Maguire from the Times on Nigel Farage’s speech today.', 'There was a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it flash of Blairism in Farage’s speech in Wales earlier: asking big employers to sponsor specialist vocational academies.', 'The spending review is now settled, Downing Street told reporters this afternoon.

She asked if the government would do all it could to lift the two-child benefit cap as soon as possible.', 'In his reply, Bell implied the current rules would not continue for long. He said:', 'We’ve said clearly that all levers to reduce child poverty are on the table.', 'The child poverty strategy will be published in the autumn, but we’re not waiting for that. We’ve already seen action, as I said earlier on, free school meals. It’s another reason why we do need to see more support for energy bills, in particular for insulating homes, because if we look at who is struggling most, having to turn off their heating, it is actually younger families with children that are struggling with that.', 'So she’s absolutely right to raise this issue. It is one of the core purposes of this government. We cannot carry on with a situation where large families, huge percentages of them, are in poverty.', 'Back in the Commons Labour’s Polly Billington asked Torsten Bell just now to confirm that, even though opposition MPs are claiming Labour has now adopted their policy, that is not right – because the government will not be paying winter fuel payments to the rich.', 'Bell said that was true of the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK. They both favour paying winter fuel payments to millionaires, he said.', 'But he said he had “no idea” what the Conservative policy was.', 'The Tories criticised the winter fuel payments cut, but have not committed to reversing it in full. Kemi Badenoch has said she favours some sort of means testing for the benefit, to stop millionaires getting it, but she has not said in detail how she would do this.', 'The National Pensioners Convention, which represents pensioners, has welcomed the U-turn on the winter fuel payment – but also called for compensation for those affected by the cut last year.', 'Jan Shortt, general secretary of the NPC, said:', 'We welcome the change in direction by the Chancellor over the winter fuel payment for the coming winter. It is a victory for common sense and proves the government have finally listened to our voices.', 'However, there is still no recognition of the devastating impact the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment had on older people over December 2024 to February 2025.', 'Statistics show that older people were switching off appliances, rationing the use of energy, cutting down on food and other household bills after losing the payment. Many will now be in debt to their energy provider, with some taking out loans to pay bills at enormous interest.', 'We believe it is only fair that the government pay compensation for older people who were living in freezing conditions whilst MPs were claiming their energy costs for their second homes.', 'The Welsh Conservatives have described Nigel Farage’s proposals for Wales today (see 3pm) as a “mirage”.

Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid’s leader at Westminster, said:', 'While [Rachel] Reeves’ U-turn is welcome, it’s clear that it was driven by polling, not principle. If the most vulnerable people were a true priority for Labour, they wouldn’t need public pressure to act and these cuts would never have been made in the first place.', 'If this UK government wants to deliver its promise of change, it must also go further and reverse the cruel cuts to welfare, including to Pip payments. Anything less will show this government is more interested in headlines than helping those who need it most.', 'Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor.', 'The Scottish government will get about £120m extra from the UK government as a result of the winter fuel payments U-turn for England and Wales, sources have indicated.

He says pensioners will not be drawn into the tax system or into self-assessment just as a result of this.', 'And he says, to get the money, pensioners will not have to do anything, because it will be paid automatically.', 'The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly UK podcast is out. It features Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey talking about the winter fuel payments U-turn and the spending review.', 'During his Q&A in Wales earlier Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, rejected the suggestion that the spat with Zia Yusuf last week showed that he was incapable of leading a team. A journalist put it him that he kept falling out with colleagues. But Farage claimed this was not true. He replied:', 'I think the evidence actually is very different. You’ll find the teams that work with me – many of them have been with me for over a decade. One or two that I worked with I worked with for 25 years …', 'I am someone that maintains long-term friendships, and I’ll do that.', 'But if ever anybody talks behind my back, or if anybody betrays that trust, then I’ll never speak to them again. Quite simple, and they should expect the same level of trust back from me.', 'Farage also claimed that problem was caused by people thinking they would make a better leader.', 'Inevitably, what you get are people who think they’re bigger and better than me, the party will be better off run by somebody else than me. And that’s what leads to the public fallouts because they don’t like the result of it.', 'But Farage said the fallout with Zia Yusuf showed he could resolve disputes with colleagues', 'Was I annoyed with Zia on Thursday? I wasn’t exactly chuffed with what he had to say … But, you know what, people make mistakes. And he came back to me and honestly said, ‘Look, I’m really sorry.’ Have I forgiven him? It’s done, it’s behind us, and we move on.', 'Farage also defended Reform UK’s inability to say at this point who its candidate for first minister will be in next year’s Senedd elections. The party does not have a leader in Wales yet. Asked why not, he replied:', 'This party is evolving. It is a work in progress. We are building rapidly as we go. Figures will emerge over the course of the next few months, who, through merit, will no doubt be in a position where they can qualify to be our lead member. We are not at that point of evolution just yet.', 'Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, says the US government and the Dutch parliament have both expressed concerns about sensitive cables running under the site of the proposed Chinese embassy at Royal Mint Court.', 'The Chinese have a record of cutting cables, he says.', 'Rerouting cables would cost millions, he says.', 'He asks why the government previously denied the presence of cables under the site.', 'And Chinese media claims the Chinese government has been told the application will be approved.', 'He says the embassy plan is becoming a “walk of shame” for the government.', 'In response, Pennycook repeats his point about not being able to comment on this application.', 'On cables specifically, he says he cannot comment on national security issues.', 'And he says the government does not “recognise” the account of this given in a Sunday Times report yesterday.', 'In its splash, the Sunday Times said President Trump is urging Keir Starmer to block the report on national security grounds.', 'In the Commons Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, is responding to the urgent question from Iain Duncan-Smith about the “the United States government’s national security concerns regarding the proposed Chinese embassy development at Royal Mint Court”.', 'He says the government respects the probity of the planning process. He says, because ministers have a role when applications are called in, he cannot comment in detail on any application.', 'But he says he will set out the process. This application will be decided by ministers, but the application is not yet with them.', 'An independent planning inspector looks at applications that come to ministers, and make indepedendent recommendations, he says.', 'He says an inquiry has already looked at this case.', 'He says the home and foreign secretaries made a joint submission to the inquiry.', 'Once the report from the inquiry is received, a planning minister will make a decision.', 'Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor.', 'The Scottish government has complained that it still has little detail of how the substantial reversal of the winter fuel payment cut will affect its budgets, and asked for clarification.\n\nShirley-Anne Somerville, the Scottish social justice secretary, said:', 'I welcome any extension of eligibility by the UK government, but this is a U-turn the chancellor [Rachel Reeves] should have made a long time ago. But there is still no detail about how the chancellor intends to go about that. Unfortunately, it still sounds as if many pensioners will miss out.\n\nWe have once again not been consulted on the policy and its implications in Scotland and will scrutinise the proposals carefully when they are announced. I would therefore urge the UK government to ensure the Scottish government is fully apprised of the proposed changes as soon as possible.', 'Reeves’ decision only affects pensioners earning up to £35,000 in England and Wales. The payment has been devolved in Scotland for some time, but Scottish ministers had been slow to implement and award their first payments – despite its rhetoric about the UK government’s “betrayal” of pensioners.\n\nIt is unclear why Scottish ministers need to be consulted over a payment decision affecting England and Wales, about a policy which is devolved. The Scottish government also had a record Treasury grant this year, partly funded by cuts to this benefit - cash which enabled ministers in Edinburgh to restore the payment in full in Scotland.\n\nHowever, the Treasury has not yet said how much money this change in England and Wales will generate for the Scottish and Northern Irish governments (devolved governments receive a proportional share of any increase in spending in England under the Barnett formula). That uplift will allow ministers in Edinburgh to spend more in politically advantageous policy areas.', 'UPDATE: The Scottish government will get about £120m extra from the UK government as a result of the winter fuel payments U-turn for England and Wales, sources have indicated.', 'Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, was speaking about winter fuel payments at his event in Port Talbot (see 12.28pm), but the main point of his speech was to call for the reindustralisation of south Wales. In comments that had been well trailed in advance, he said that he wanted to reopen mines and reopen the blast furnaces at the Port Talbot steelworks.', 'In his speech he said:', 'Our ambition is to reindustrialise Wales.', 'We are going to be using more steel over the next few years than we probably ever used as we increase military spending and as we attempt a house building programme in Wales, and even more so in England, of massive proportionsj just to catch up with the population explosion over the last 20 years. We are going to need a lot of steel.', 'Our belief is we should be producing our own steel. Our belief is, for what use coal still has, we should produce our own coal …', 'I’m not saying let’s open up all the pits. What I am saying is there’s coal, specific types of coal, for certain uses that we still need in this country, and we certainly will need for the blast furnaces here, that we should produce ourselves rather than importing.', 'But, during the Q&A, a BBC reporter put it to Farage that industry sources saying reopening the blast furnaces at Port Talbot would be impossible. Asked about this, Farage conceded that reopening a blast furnace would be very difficult. A new one might be needed, he said.', 'He replied:', 'Once a blast furnace has been closed down, to actually reopen that particular blast furnace is very, very difficult. Nothing’s impossible, but it might be difficult. It might be easier to build a new one.', 'Could a Welsh government, Welsh devolved government, do it on its own? It would need some help from national government too, which is why I phrased all of this this morning very, very carefully into saying, not ‘we will do this once we’re in control in Cardiff’, [but] ‘this will be our ambition, we’d need a Westminster government to approve this as well’. Who knows, that might be us in time. And we’d need to work with companies as well. But, as an ambition, it’s the right one.', 'And, on mining, asked if there was any evidence that Welsh people want their children to go down mines again, given so many miners wanted their sons not to have to do these dangerous jobs, Farage replied:', 'If you offer people well-paid jobs, you would be surprised, many will take them, even though we’d all accept that mining is dangerous.', 'As WalesOnline reports, Welsh Labour have dismissed this as fantasy politics. A Welsh Labour spokesperson said:', 'Nigel Farage has no plans for steel - just a camera crew. You can’t restart a blast furnace with a press conference.', 'Nigel Farage says that hopefully they mightthey’ll bring back mining. The people of Wales will see through the false hope and false promises of a public-school boy from England who does not understand them and does not understand Wales.', 'His answer is to bring back the mines. The only thing Nigel Farage is trying to mine is votes from communities that have already gone through tough times. Nigel Farage has today brought his fantasy politics and magic money tree to Port Talbot. He’s gambling with real people’s livelihoods.', 'The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank focusing on the interests of low and middle earners, says the new winter fuel payments (WFPs) policy is “only marginally progressive”. In a briefing note it says:', 'According to DWP caseload data, in 2023-24 around 11.6 million pensioners received WFPs at a cost of around £2.2bn. Last winter (2024-25), around 1.3 million pensioners received WFPs at a cost of around £300 million. Next winter (2025-26), under these plans, around 9 million pensioners will receive WFPs at a cost of around £1.6bn.', 'The new scheme is only marginally progressive, with 57% pensioners gaining from the new policy in the bottom half of the income distribution, and the remaining 43% in the top half.', 'In tax/benefit policy terms, “progressive” means benefiting poorer people more than richer people.', 'Alex Clegg, an economist at the thinktank, said:', 'The new scheme for means-testing winter fuel payments means that that the number of pensioners receiving support will rise from 1.3 million last winter to around 9 million this winter, and not far off the 11.6 million who received winter fuel payments two winters ago when they were universal.', 'But this U-turn doesn’t represent a return to the status quo. The new means-test will create new complexity in the tax system, including a cliff-edge for those with around £35,000 of income. The reported savings of £450m will be reduced further by the cost of increased pension credit take-up as a result of the original policy, and the cost of administering the new means-test.', 'The real question is why it is now a priority to pay winter fuel payments to over three quarters of pensioners, with almost half of the new beneficiaries in the richest half of the population, when previously it was judged that only one-in-ten needed support.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNW1TRVp6UW1oeE5UaDFVRFZNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZcFZaU3VKUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

Three-quarters of pensioners to get winter fuel payment after U-turn,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4gnk7g228o,"['More than three-quarters of pensioners will receive the winter fuel payment this year after Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed a major policy U-turn.', 'Nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of £35,000 or less will now be eligible.', 'The payment, worth up to £300 to help with energy bills during the coldest months, was paid only to those on pension credit last year.', 'The policy was widely blamed for Labour\'s poor local election results. Reeves said the government had ""listened to people\'s concerns"", but Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called the change a ""humiliating U-turn"".', ""The reversal comes ahead of the government's Spending Review, details of which will be announced on Wednesday."", 'The government said the increased winter fuel payment threshold meant ""no lower or middle-income pensioners will miss out"".', '""It will still be means-tested but at a higher level,"" Reeves said.', '""Because of changes we\'ve made and the stability we\'ve brought back to the economy, we are able to increase that amount.""', 'The chancellor said she would set out how the £1.25bn policy would be paid for in the autumn Budget, but added she would stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules.', 'The government has argued that as the economy is improving, it has more room to increase eligibility for the payments. It has said the policy change will ""not lead to permanent additional borrowing"".', 'However, while economic growth was better than expected in the first quarter of the year, most analysts expect it to slow in the months ahead.', 'The Treasury has said the change will not lead to permanent additional borrowing, but Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this implied ""it will lead to permanent additional taxes (or just possibly permanent cuts to other bits of welfare)"".', 'Eligible households with a person under 80 automatically receive £200 a year in November or December, while homes with a person over 80 receive £300.', 'The payments are halved if one household has two pensioners living together. If one of them has an income of more than £35,000 and the other earns less than £35,000, the higher-income pensioner will not receive any payment and the lower-income pensioner will receive half the payment.', 'Pensioners above the £35,000 annual income threshold, which the Treasury said was ""broadly in line with average earnings"", will have the payment automatically recovered or be able to opt out. This will apply to about two million people.', 'Bob Pritchard, 78, from Bath, told the BBC he earns £19,500 a year and believes he will now have his payment reinstated.', 'He says losing the money has had ""a lot of impact"", and caused ""grief and heartache"". He says the government\'s U-turn ""will make a lot of difference"".', 'The original cut to universal winter fuel payments last year had been estimated to save £1.7bn.', ""But concerns had been raised among charities and some MPs over the government's previous policy, particularly over those pensioners whose income was slightly too high to qualify, but were hit by the loss of the payment as energy costs remained expensive."", 'Charities welcomed the U-turn, but said more needed to be done. End Fuel Poverty Coalition coordinator Simon Francis said Reeves had ""seen sense"", but urged ministers to ""focus on how it supports all households in fuel poverty"".', 'Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""This humiliating U-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter.', '""Keir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,"" she added. ""The prime minister should now apologise for his terrible judgement.""', 'Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey says the government had ""finally realised how disastrous this policy was"", adding the ""misery it has caused cannot be overstated"".', 'The Resolution Foundation think tank said the U-turn would ""create new complexity in the tax system, including a cliff-edge for those with around £35,000 of income"".', '""The reported savings of £450m will be reduced further by the cost of increased pension credit take-up as a result of the original policy, and the cost of administering the new means-test,"" added Alex Clegg, economist at the think tank.', 'The government said no one would need to register with HMRC or take any further action to receive payments, and pensioners who want to opt out will be able to do so through a system set to be developed.', 'In Scotland, ministers have already outlined a different policy. Those in receipt of qualifying benefits like pension credit would get the payment as before, while others would get £100.', 'The funds - which are limited to one payment per household - will be paid through a new Scottish Parliament benefit, which will not be ready until late 2025.', 'In Northern Ireland, Communities Minister Gordon Lyons said last year that funding constraints meant the Stormont government also had to change its rules.', 'He later said affected pensioners would receive of one-off payment of £100 to help with heating costs.', ""The confirmation that more people will receive winter fuel payments this winter comes ahead of the government's spending review, which will be announced on Wednesday."", 'The review will outline day-to-day departmental budgets over the next three years and investment budgets over the next four.', 'Whitehall insiders have told the BBC they expect it will be ""ugly"".', ""Reeves's position on ruling out borrowing for day-to-day spending and not raising taxes again has fuelled strong speculation that spending cuts will be made."", 'Copyright 2025 BBC.
