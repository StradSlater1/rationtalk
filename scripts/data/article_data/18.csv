The ascent is so less (in mm) that it looks almost flat and the train runs at quite a high speed as if it is running in plains. Although if one sees the Jammu-Udhampur road that zigzags through the mountains, one can see how difficult it was to lay a track that had so few curves.', '""There was immense seepage on the route due to nullahs flowing above the tunnels, which had almost jeopardised the entire project. The engineers had to build stronger and thicker concrete structures to prevent it. Their width went up to 25 metres on each side of the tunnel and also above it.

There are hundreds others from Udhampur who commute daily now. Earlier they had to spend more money and time to reach their offices in Jammu. The DMU travel just costs Rs 9 one side while the general ticket in the Express train costs Rs 32.', 'Bajalta, Singar, Manwal and Ramnagar are thinly inhabited villagea along this rail track.

Some offer a view of the Himalayas, others of the deep valleys or sprawling meadows.', 'Rural art is evident in the houses along the track, as the train chugs leaving behind clusters of mostly kutcha and a few concrete houses. One can see the mud walls painted in bright colours and etched with lovely drawings.', 'For traders at Udhampur, the train has come as a lifeline. It provides easy transportation of fuel, vegetables and other goods which otherwise took long time via the road route.', 'Ramanand Bahria, a trader of Udhampur, says the train line has revolutionised their life and work, "" We now dash to Delhi directly from Udhampur and Delhi businessman too, reach here easily in a short time and with less hassles.

Even the movement of a regiment has become easier as special army train can now take it to its new deployment place anywhere in the country.', 'The train may have made the life of people easier but for hundreds of security personnel, guarding the 20 tunnels over 150 bridges, is a tough task. These guards live in makeshift tents, their only entertainment being the sight of the passing train, whose safe passage is the aim of their deployment there.', 'For travellers journeying on this route there is some good news in the offing as the Railways is in the process of providing more facilities to them.

Indian Railways has compared its height with the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which stands 330 metres (1,082 feet), and said the bridge is built to last 120 years and endure extreme weather, including wind speeds up to 260 km/h (161mph).', 'Modi visited the Chenab bridge on Friday with tight security, waving an Indian tri-colour flag before boarding a test train that passed through picturesque mountains and tunnels to reach an inauguration ceremony for another high-elevation bridge named Anji.', 'The railway “ensures all weather connectivity” and will “boost spiritual tourism and create livelihood opportunities”, Modi said.', 'The prime minister also helped launch a pair of new trains called “Vande Bharat” that will halve the travel time between Srinagar and the town of Katra in the Jammu region to about three hours from the usual six to seven hours by road.', 'Modi’s visit to Indian-controlled Kashmir on Friday is his first since a military conflict between India and Pakistan brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of war last month when the countries fired missiles and drones at each other.', 'The conflict was triggered after a shooting attack in late April that left 26 men, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.', 'India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety.', 'Armed groups in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.', 'India insists the Kashmir armed groups are backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies.', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTZWVzluWTBReWNWZG1VMGxhVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdZcFJJQU1uZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df
Modi opens India’s railway bridge to connect with Kashmir,https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/india-kashmir-railway-modi-j2n0qsxh5,"['Now showing content from the last twelve months, not just the past six days.', 'M\nore than 130 years ago, the all-powerful Maharaja Hari Singh dreamt of a railway to link the Himalayan Kashmir Valley to the rest of the sub continent.', 'He first proposed the idea in 1892 and commissioned engineers from the ruling British colonial power in India to survey the rugged terrain and prepare reports on the feasibility of a railway route. They were all ultimately rejected and over time the plan appeared to be shelved for ever.', 'However, on Friday, 64 years after the Maharaja’s death, his dream came true when the prime minister Narendra Modi officially opened the world’s highest railway bridge, finally linking the valley to India’s vast train network, calling it “the crown jewel of India”.', 'The bridge is being trumpeted as an engineering marvel, a symbol of India’s economic strength, and comes at a politically sensitive time following a terror attack that killed 26 in the popular tourist Pahalgam area of the contested region in April which triggered a deadly four-day clash between India and Pakistan last month.', '“Pakistan will never forget … its shameful loss,” Modi told crowds gathered on Friday after he walked across the bridge carrying a large Indian flag. “Today’s event is a grand festival of India’s unity and firm resolve.”', 'He added: “This is a symbol and celebration of rising India.”', 'It was his first visit to Kashmir since the conflict.', 'The bridge is the centrepiece of the Udhampur-Katra-Baramulla project, a 272-km (169 miles) link through the mountainous region with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges, connecting Jammu and Kashmir by train for the first time with India’s rail network. It is expected to halve the travel time between the town of Katra, in the Hindu-majority Jammu region, and Srinagar, the main city in Kashmir, to around three hours.', 'The £200 million bridge stands high up in the Himalayas. The distance down to the river bed is 359 metres, higher than the Eiffel Tower, while its length spans 1.3 km. Some 30,000 tonnes of steel were used to build it.', 'Delhi calls the Chenab span the “world’s highest railway arch bridge”. While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in neighbouring China.', 'The idea for the bridge was revived in the 1980s and finally approved in 2002. As well as the message it sends about modern-day India, it is hoped will boost regional trade by providing an all-weather link.', 'Currently, during the winter months, the road link between Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of India is often out of bounds owing to heavy snowfall blocking the highway. Trade by road comes to a standstill, causing losses to local businesses.', 'For the state-owned Indian Railways, the bridge is the biggest civil engineering challenge in modern times and fills a gap left by the British who built a vast railway network.', 'During British rule, blasting and drilling through the mountains on either side of the river to build bridges, tunnels and embankments was seen as too risky. The Himalayan range is young, notoriously delicate and prone to springing nasty geological surprises.', 'The weather, with heavy snowfall and landslides and temperatures of below -20C, was another deterrent.', 'Such challenges remained in the modern era, and are the reason the project suffered endless delays and missed deadlines even when construction finally started in 2017. The first problem was simply getting the materials and manpower to the remote site.', 'The first engineers who surveyed the area travelled by mule or by foot to reach the remote location. With no useable roads, small factories had to be set up around the site to manufacture the steel and concrete parts and pylons.', 'Nor was there any electricity or water supply. Electricity for manufacturing had to be specially generated at the site and water for the concrete was piped from far away.', 'Given its altitude, the bridge has been designed to withstand wind speeds of 165 mph and high-intensity earthquakes measuring up to 8 on the Richter scale.', 'A special testing lab was set up at the site to keep checking that the steel elements could withstand temperatures ranging from -10C to 40C and seismic activity.', 'The bridge also had to be blast-proof. Engineers working on the project say that even if a powerful bomb goes off and a pillar is damaged or blown away, the trains will slow down but continue to run.', 'Since the bridge is so high and subject to winds, a special paint was developed that is resistant to corrosion for up to 15 years.', 'For the arch, cranes hanging off cables lowered the parts into place. In August 2022, the two sides of the bridge, which had kept inching towards each other through the air, finally met in the middle and the last ‘golden joint’, with the Indian flag stuck on it, was manoeuvred into position to cheers from workers.', 'In February 2023, work to lay the railway tracks began and train trials followed.', 'Modi also announced further government financial support for those families whose relatives were killed, or whose homes were damaged, during the recent brief conflict, which claimed more than 80 lives in India and Pakistan. “Their troubles are our troubles,” he said.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.
