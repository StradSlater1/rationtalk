SEAN O’MALLEY | FULL CIRCLE IN NEWARK,https://www.ufc.com/news/sean-omalley-full-circle-newark-ufc-316-newark,"['On most fronts, Sean O’Malley’s first meeting with Merab Dvalishvili didn’t go as anticipated.', 'Paired off in the main event of UFC 306 last September at Sphere, O’Malley entered as the champion, seeking the second defense of his bantamweight tile, while Dvalishvili arrived as the hard-charging challenger, eager to avenge the loss suffered by his dear friend and long-time training partner Aljamain Sterling and claim championship gold for himself.', 'Dvalishvili largely dominated the fight, using his relentless wrestling and bottomless gas tank to dethrone the usually iridescent champion, whose output and flair was far more muted that first time around. In the aftermath of the contest, O’Malley disclosed that he entered the fight with a significant hip injury that limited his ability to grapple during training camp — a prerequisite when you’re preparing to fight the Georgian — and the assumption was that once he was healthy and ready to return, the two would face off again.', 'GET YOUR TICKETS: UFC 316 | UFC Atlanta | UFC Baku | UFC 317 | UFC Nashville ', '“Physically it was completely different,” O’Malley said of his training camp for this weekend’s championship rematch with Dvalishvili. “I was able to prepare the proper way for a guy like Merab. You can’t run the mountain, hit mitts, and then go fight Merab; you’ve got to be on the mats, grappling. You’ve got to be wrestling, and that’s what we were able to do this fight.', ""“Even last fight, I was very confident going into that cage, thought I was gonna put his lights out — didn’t get the job done — but I'm even more confident this time.”"", 'Being at full strength is far from the only difference this time around for O’Malley, who heads into his fourth consecutive championship engagement.', 'Earlier this year, the Arizona-based athlete scaled all the way back on his social media, while simultaneously pressing pause on his use of marijuana; two things that were tremendously influential in his rapid rise to fame and elevation to superstar status in the UFC.', 'FOLLOW @UFCNEWS: On Facebook | On Instagram | On X | On Threads ', ""“I don’t think…those weren’t…” began O’Malley, searching for the right words. “I don’t think there was a lack of discipline or being too distracted going into any of those camps. Every camp has been good — I've been able to focus, able to dial in. These were more changes in a day-to-day, personal, how my mind feels. "", '“I always felt good, felt happy, but I was like, ‘I feel like I’m missing out. I feel like I could be a little more present, a little more happy.’ For me, eliminating distractions was the key to that. I think it will play a role in my performance, somewhat, but that wasn’t really the reason I did it.” ', 'Though preparation wasn’t the reason for the changes, the thoughtful and articulate challenger does recognize the impact cutting out social media has had on his stress levels heading into this weekend’s highly anticipated rematch with Dvalishvili.', '“Just being off my phone makes me feel like I have a lot less stress,” he said. “The build-up to the fight isn’t as big when you’re not seeing it everywhere; you’re not seeing it on Twitter, you’re not seeing it on Instagram.', ""UFC 316 FREE FIGHTS: Pena vs Nunes | Dvalishvili vs Nurmagomdeov | Harrison vs Holm | O'Malley vs Sterling "", '“I’m not seeing it as much, so I’m not building it up to be some crazy event.

Four months later, he was back in the Octagon, authoring a signature win over undefeated challenger Umar Nurmagomedov, leaning on his conditioning and pace to rally over the final three rounds to retain his title.', 'RELATED: Merab Dvalishvili | The Character', 'For the 30-year-old challenger, UFC 316 represents an opportunity to fix the things that didn’t flow properly the last time they met, both inside and outside of the Octagon.', '“I think last fight was almost like a forced beef, rather than a real beef,” suggested O’Malley, whose social media retreat has made for a much quieter build to this weekend’s rematch. “The fight before that with “Chito” was a real beef, and that one did well on pay-per-view, people wanted to see it.', '“Me as a fan? For the main event, I want those m*****f****** that hate each other and there is something to it, but I kind of forced that last fight — it didn’t feel genuine, didn’t feel real — and I think if people aren’t as excited because there isn’t beef there, it is what it is. ', '“The positives I took away are that without a great camp, without doing what we did this camp, I was still able to go out there and win some rounds,” he added, shifting attention to inside the cage. “At the end of the day, I wasn’t too disappointed in my performance.”', 'Fighters on the Rise | UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs O’Malley 2', 'While fights like this are often framed as the chance for the vanquished combatant from the first meeting seeking vengeance, the reality for O’Malley — and most fighters, honestly — is that they would love a chance to run it back with anyone that gets the better of them, championship fight or not.

I want to end it in a beautiful, viral KO; that’s the goal every fight. ', '“I think he’s supposed to beat me,” he added, pivoting to the expectations currently heaped on the champion’s shoulders and the ease he feels heading into battle this weekend. “He beat me last fight, he’s the champ, he’s the favorite, he’s the greatest of all time, and I don’t feel like I have much pressure on my shoulders.

', '“It’s gonna be incredible,” he said when asked how it would feel to become a two-time champion on Saturday night. “To take the belt from Aljamain Sterling and then to take the belt from his teammate Merab — that’s movie-s***; you can’t make that s*** up.

FIGHT BY FIGHT PREVIEW | UFC 316: DVALISHVILI VS O'MALLEY 2,https://www.ufc.com/news/fight-fight-preview-ufc-316-dvalishvili-vs-omalley-2,"['For the third consecutive year, the Octagon makes a spring stop at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, for a star-studded pay-per-view fight card that is sure to captivate all those in attendance and the masses watching at home.', 'Headlined by bantamweight title fights in both the men’s and women’s divisions, UFC 316 features a stacked lineup that includes critical additional bouts in the heavyweight, middleweight, bantamweight, and flyweight divisions, as well as intriguing pairings across several other weight classes.', 'All told, it’s a tremendous card that carries tons of promise and explosive potential, and we have a full breakdown of what to expect collected for you here. ', 'Enjoy!', 'Main Event: Merab Dvalishvili vs Sean O’Malley', 'Co-Main Event: Julianna Pena vs Kayla Harrison', 'Location: Prudential Center — Newark, NJ', 'Where to Watch: ESPN / ESPN+ / Disney+ / UFC Fight Pass', 'Other Main Card Matches:', 'GET YOUR TICKETS: UFC 316 | UFC Atlanta | UFC Baku | UFC 317 | UFC Nashville', 'Prelim Matches:', 'Saturday’s pay-per-view wraps with a bantamweight championship rematch between Merab Dvalishvili and “Suga” Sean O’Malley. ', 'The champion enters his second title defense on a 12-fight winning streak, having already successfully defended his belt earlier this year against Umar Nurmagomedov. Unbeaten since opening his UFC career with consecutive setbacks, Dvalishvili continues to be one of the foremost examples of a fighter that has learned to weaponize his conditioning and pressure to break opponents, confident that even if he drops early rounds, his superior gas tank and non-stop motor will allow him to rally in the late stages of the fight.', ""WATCH: Dvalishvili Sit-Down Interview | O'Malley Sit-Down Interview  "", 'O’Malley turned 30 a few weeks after his UFC 306 loss to Dvalishvili, and heads into battle off a loss for the first time in eight fights. The flamboyant fighter was uncharacteristically hesitant to let go of his weapons in the first meeting, falling behind early and never truly working his way back into the fight, though he did sting Dvalishvili late and win the fifth round on all three scorecards. ', 'One of the big questions heading into this one is how much did the injury O’Malley carried into the first contest limit his abilities? He’s since had surgery to repair the issue, so it shouldn’t be an issue this time around, and now we’ll find out how big of an impact it played on his performance, and see what kind of adjustments each side has made now that they have 25 minutes of experience against one another to draw from. ', 'Before the boys close out the show, the ladies will light up the Octagon as Julianna Pena puts her title on the line against Kayla Harrison in the bantamweight championship co-main event.', 'Pena claimed the title for a second time with a dogged split decision win over Raquel Pennington last October in Salt Lake City. It was a quintessential Pena performance, as the first female Ultimate Fighter winner leaned on her grit, tenacity, and steady output early to race out to an early lead and hold off the champion down the stretch in the closely contested bout.', 'Harrison also competed on that card in Salt Lake City, earning her place as No. 1 contender with a unanimous decision win over Ketlen Vieira earlier in the evening. Though it wasn’t as dominant as her debut win over Holly Holm in April, there were probably more positives to take away from her most recent outing, as the two-time Olympic gold medalist showed she could push through three hard rounds, at altitude, in a tough stylistic matchup with a perennial contender.', 'How To Watch And Stream UFC 316 In Your Country  ', 'As much as the banter between these two is going to be terrific in the days leading up to this weekend’s contest, it’s how things play out once they get in there that is most captivating. On paper, it feels like a bout that could hinge on how long it lasts, with most forecasting Harrison to have success early, but Pena to be the more successful of the two if things reach the championship rounds.', 'It will be interesting to see what transpires, especially with the potential for a massive fight with 2025 Hall of Fame inductee and former two-division champion Amanda Nunes sitting out there as a huge opportunity for whomever emerges with the belt around their waist should “The Lioness” end her retirement.', 'We’ve got ourselves a critical clash in the middleweight division that grew a little more compelling following a postponement in Mexico City, as Kelvin Gastelum faces off with Joe Pyfer in the middle of Saturday’s pay-per-view main card.', 'Gastelum officially moves back up to middleweight, where he’s gone 7-6 with one no contest in 14 UFC appearances at 185 pounds. Last time out, a weight management issue prompted his welterweight bout with Daniel Rodriguez to be moved up a division during fight week, so there is extra pressure on the former Ultimate Fighter winner to have things dialed in and deliver a strong performance here.', 'MORE UFC 316: Main Event Coach Conversation', 'Pyfer went 1-1 in 2024, opening his year with a unanimous decision loss to Jack Hermansson in a main event pairing that is sure to stand as a tremendous learning experience for the 28-year-old Philly-based fighter. He followed that up with a rapid knockout win over Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, earning his fourth win and fourth finish in five starts since landing on the roster. ', 'The duo were expected to clash in Mexico City at the end of March, but Pyfer was forced out due to illness, delaying the highly anticipated matchup. It’s a massive fight for both men as Gastelum is looking to show he’s capable of making another push towards the top of the middleweight ranks, while Pyfer aims to collect the biggest win of his career by defeating the impending Hall of Fame inductee.', 'The first of the main card’s three outstanding bantamweight pairings features the streaking Mario Bautista taking on promotional newcomer Patchy Mix in an absolute must-see fixture.', 'A member of The MMA Lab, Bautista has quietly put together a solid seven-fight winning streak heading into this one, most recently having edged out legend Jose Aldo as part of that UFC 307 fight card in Salt Lake City last October. When at his best, Bautista is a well-rounded, attacking competitor who can beat you in a number of ways, exhibiting a willingness to trade on the feet, an ability to dominate on the canvas, and the conditioning to go three hard rounds at a good clip.', ""FULL FIGHTS: Dvalishvili vs O'Malley 1 | O'Malley vs Sterling | Dvalishvili vs Nurmagomedov | Peña vs Nunes 1 | Harrison vs Holm  "", 'One of the biggest additions to the UFC roster in the last couple years, Mix was widely regarded as one of the best bantamweights competing outside of the Octagon prior to joining the promotion. He’s amassed a 20-1 record with a number of wins over familiar names, having won and successfully defended the interim Bellator bantamweight title and undisputed Bellator bantamweight title over his last three outings. ', 'Bautista was originally scheduled to face off with Marlon “Chito” Vera before the fan favorite was forced to withdraw, opening the door for Mix to step into a pay-per-view main card matchup with a ranked opponent right out of the chute. This is a huge fight for both men, and the winner should find themselves in the thick of the title conversation once the smoke clears following this weekend’s event at “The Rock.”', 'Welterweight veterans Vicente Luque and Kevin Holland are tasked with opening up Saturday’s pay-per-view main card in New Jersey.', 'This is a home game of sorts for Luque, who was born an hour north in Westwood, and heads into his 2025 debut off a technical submission win over Themba Gorimbo last December at UFC 310. Now 33 and making the walk for the 23rd time in his UFC career (and 35th time overall), “The Silent Assassin” remains a fixture in the Top 15, and an all-action attraction each time he competes.', ""READ: May's Monthly Report  "", 'It seems as if Holland is trying to re-write the record books as he makes his third appearance already this year on Saturday, putting him on pace to potentially log six bouts in 2025 if he’s able to stay healthy and find the right matchups. After getting quickly submitted by Reinier de Ridder at UFC 311 in January, “Trailblazer” dropped back down to welterweight and outworked Gunnar Nelson in March, moving him to 5-4 in the UFC when fighting in the 170-pound weight class. ', 'Will Luque collect a second straight win close to home or can Holland build on his success in London and force his way into the welterweight rankings?', 'Ranked flyweights Bruno Silva and Joshua Van face off in the final preliminary card bout of the night this weekend at Prudential Center. ', 'Silva, who sits at No. 12, looks to rebound after having his four-fight winning streak snapped by top contender Manel Kape at last year’s final event in Tampa, Florida. The 23-year-old currently sits two spots behind his Brazilian counterpart, and arrives having won three straight, most recently bouncing Japanese prospect Rei Tsuruya from the ranks of the unbeaten in March.', 'Unbeaten Russian Azamat Murzakanov returns to take on Brazil’s Brendson Ribeiro in this compelling light heavyweight matchup.', 'A perfect 14-0 for his career, including earning wins in each of his first four UFC starts, Murzakanov hasn’t fought since registering a second-round stoppage win over Alonzo Menifield last August and then serving a six-month suspension following a positive test for a banned substance. Ribeiro has earned consecutive victories after dropping each of his first two appearances inside the Octagon, following up his narrow win over Caio Machado in Edmonton with a second-round submission win over unbeaten prospect Diyar Nurgozhay earlier this year.', 'Serghei Spivac and Waldo Cortes Acosta face off in this under the radar clash of Top 15 heavyweights.', 'Still only 30 years old, Spivac has settled into a stable position in the middle third of the rankings, posting a 7-3 mark over his last 10 fights, with each of his losses coming against individuals currently ranked ahead of him. A member of the Dana White’s Contender Series (DWCS) Class of ’22, Cortes Acosta arrives in New Jersey on a four-fight winning streak, having most recently collected a second-round knockout win over Ryan Spann in March.', 'Welterweights that recently had opponents fall out face off here as Khaos Williams welcomes Andreas Gustafsson to the Octagon for the first time.', ""Williams, who was initially scheduled to face Uros Medic this weekend, looks to get things moving in the right direction again after suffering a second-round submission loss to Gabriel Bonfim last time out. A member of last year's DWCS graduating class, Gustafsson was originally set to debut last week in Las Vegas before a late opponent withdrawal shuffled the 11-2 Swedish finisher into this combustible pairing with Williams on Saturday."", '', ""An illness knocked MarQuel Mederos out of his scheduled bout last weekend, leading to the Dana White's Contender Series grad tagging in here against promotional newcomer Mark Choinski."", 'The 28-year-old Mederos has won each of his first two UFC appearances, most recently edging out Austin Hubbard in Mexico City, to extend his winning streak to eight and push his record to 10-1 overall. Unbeaten in eight pro fights, Choinski is a former DIII All-American wrestler and arrives in the UFC off the first successful defense of his APFC lightweight title in March.', 'The barrage of flyweight action taking place as of late continues here, as Ariane da Silva steps in with Wang Cong.', 'After posting three straight wins upon returning to the 125-pound ranks, da Silva heads into her first appearance of the year looking to halt a two-fight skid, having landed on the wrong side of things against Karine Silva and Jasmine Jasudavicius in 2024. Wang has alternated results over her first three UFC appearances, scoring a blistering knockout in over Victoria Leonardo in her debut before getting submitted by Gabriella Fernandes in her sophomore outing, then besting Bruna Brasil earlier this year at UFC 312.', 'Road to UFC alum Jeka Saragih welcomes unbeaten South Korean prospect JooSang Woo to the Octagon for the first time here in this intriguing bantamweight matchup.', 'The first Indonesian fighter on the UFC roster, Saragih scored a vicious first-round knockout win over Lucas Alexander in November 2023 but landed on the wrong side of a first-round finish last time out, getting submitted by Westin Wilson. Yoo arrives in the UFC with a pristine 8-0 record that includes three first-round stoppage wins, with his most noteworthy efforts to date coming against journeymen Gustavo Wurlitzer and Shunichi Shimizu.', '', 'Lightweights Quillan Salkilld and Yanal Ashmouz are tasked with kicking things off this weekend in New Jersey.', 'Salkilld showed out in a similar position at UFC 312, needing just 18 seconds to dispatch Anshul Jubli. Ashmouz makes his fourth trek into the UFC cage here, looking to build off his unanimous decision win over Trevor Peek last August.', ""Don't miss a moment of UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs O'Malley 2, live from Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on June 7, 2025.

"Sean O’Malley on Fatherhood, Merab Dvalishvili Rivalry and UFC 316",https://www.si.com/mma/sean-o-malley-on-fatherhood-merab-dvalishvili-rivalry-and-ufc-316,"['They sure grow up fast, these cage fighters. Could it really have been eight years ago already that Sean O’Malley was stealing the show on Dana White’s Contender Series? Here was a scrappy, mouthy bantamweight—and most of the weight came from his abundant body ink and his copious multi-colored hair—winning sensationally and talking more sensationally, still. ', 'Deploying sneaky movement and a nuclear-grade right hand, O’Malley went a dozen pro fights without a defeat. While he finally lost to Marlon Vera at UFC 252, he avenged that defeat in a rematch last year.  ', 'Now O’Malley, the father of two (a son born in May) is, shockingly, 30 years old. And again finds himself in the role of avenger. Last September, he lost a five-round decision to the relentlessly entertaining Long Island resident (by way of Georgia) Merab Dvalishvili for the bantamweight belt. Dvalishvili then won his last fight in January at the Inuit Dome, stealing the show at UFC 311 and taking some of O’Malley’s celebrity wattage.  ', 'On Saturday, at the Prudential Center in Newark, O’Malley gets his rematch, hoping to channel the same beat-me-twice-shame-on-me energy that worked so well last time. The fight is the headline of UFC 316. A win would not only win back the belt, but would also help solidify O’Malley as perhaps the brightest star in the UFC hemisphere, a slick fighter who is all too happy to be a front facing figure in between fights. ', 'A few days after the birth of his son, and a few days before beginning his weight cut, he spoke with Sports Illustrated. The following conversation is lightly edited for brevity and clarity.', 'Sports Illustrated: Where is your head these days? What’s occupying your thoughts these days?', 'Sean O’Malley: I have a five-day-old, so, you know, changing diapers, so that occupies quite a bit of the head space right now.', 'The work [for the fight] is pretty much done so. Just kind of getting by these next few days. This is where you start really, you know, cutting the calories and start really getting the weight down. So just being a dad hanging out still, you know, still training twice a day. But these days are good, good, good times.', 'SI: Yeah. The most important question is whether big sister knows what’s coming. Is she prepared?', 'SO: She asked for it! She wanted a baby brother; she got a baby brother. So far, so good. ', 'SI: How does a rematch differ from a conventional fight where you’ve never fought together before?', 'SO: It’s definitely different fighting someone you fought before. This feels like my first real rematch. The [Vera] fight was just, it was so quick [a Round 1 TKO] I didn’t feel like the fight got to play out. So I didn’t really feel like that felt like much of a rematch. After spending 25 minutes in the cage with Merab, going in there for a second time, that’ll feel more familiar. We both felt each other in there. ', 'SI: How do you characterize your relationship with him? What’s the beef factor? ', 'SO: Merab, he’s a little goofball. I don’t mind the guy he is, he’s just Merab. He’s his own character. He’s just super smart. I don’t mind the guy.', 'SI: Do, do you prefer there to be some friction? How does the personal relationship impact the fighting for you?', ""SO: I mean, the [Vera] fight, there was like some animosity there. I really wanted to get that one back. I really want to put a whooping on him. The Merab [pre-fight hype] fight felt a little bit more forced. It’s just a sport. Athlete versus athlete. It's just competition. "", 'SI: How are we feeling about the [upcoming weight] cut? ', 'SO: I mean, mentally, I just prepare for a struggle. No one cutting weight is excited about it. You know, I’m not necessarily super excited to sit in a hot tub, but I look at cutting weight as part of the paycheck, so I gotta do that to get paid.', 'SI: When you’re in the cage, what’s the impulse you have to try hardest to fight or resist? ', 'SO: Hmm. When you get in there, you gotta just go in there and let loose, let go and flow, ideally. Not think too much.', 'SI: At this stage—you have done this a while; you’re a father—what is fighting feeding inside of you these days?', ""SO: I just, I ask myself what else would I do? You gotta go out there, beat Merab, beat the next guy, win a bunch of fights. But I’m in a position to where I could be considered the greatest of all time at a certain thing on this earth, which is a cool thing for me. Where I’m at right now, it’s just like I want to reach my full potential. I’m 30. I'm healthy. And I want to just give it everything I got while I still can."", 'SI: How well or how much do you separate kind of personal happiness from results?', 'SO: I mean, for the most part, all I’ve done is win. The first Chito fight in my mind, mentally, I didn’t lose that fight. Like I got a lot of s--- from saying I was mentally undefeated. But I really was and never felt like I lost a fight until that last fight against Merab. And you know, it wasn’t ideal, but it wasn’t like life wasn’t still good, you know? I still had my family.', ""Everyone was still healthy. If you can find growth—and suffering—you can evolve more. It's all about perspective. I feel like happiness is a skill and if you know how to be happy, you can be happy with whatever happens."", ""SI: Go back to what you said before. What do you think you would be doing if you weren't fighting?"", ""SO: I don't know. There was no plan B for me. It was plan A, get in UFC, make a lot of money."", ""SI: I’d say it's worked out pretty well.\nLast question. The cliche is: What’s the best advice you’ve ever gotten? I wanna ask you what’s the advice you’re happiest that you didn’t follow?"", ""SO: Probably early in my career when I would post about smoking weed, I got a lot of adults, a lot of people say, I'm just looking out for you. I don’t think you should be posting that. No one’s gonna wanna sponsor you. UFC’s not gonna wanna sign you. And I was like: Don’t care. I’m doing me. And uh, that was probably the greatest advice I never listened to was to, to not be myself."", 'Jon Wertheim is a senior writer for Sports Illustrated and has been part of the full-time SI writing staff since 1997, largely focusing on the tennis beat , sports business and social issues, and enterprise journalism.

"UFC 316 predictions -- Merab Dvalishvili vs. Sean O'Malley: Fight card, odds, preview, prelims, expert picks",https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-316-predictions-merab-dvalishvili-vs-sean-omalley-fight-card-odds-preview-prelims-expert-picks/,"['', ""Two UFC championships are on the line this Saturday when UFC 316 lands in Newark, New Jersey's Prudential Center. In the main event, Sean O'Malley will attempt to regain the bantamweight championship from the man who took it from him in September, Merab Dvalishvili."", ""Dvalishvili's relentless pace and seemingly endless gas tank allowed him to overwhelm O'Malley for the majority of their UFC 306 meeting, which Dvalishvili won by unanimous decision. O'Malley has claimed that he has made several lifestyle changes in taking a more serious approach to his career, but Dvalishvili's unique style still presents significant challenges for the former champ."", ""In the co-main event, two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo Kayla Harrison will challenge for the first UFC title of her career. Harrison will challenge women's bantamweight champion Julianna Pena."", ""Pena is on her second run with the title, having defeated the greatest women's mixed martial artist of all time, Amanda Nunes, to win the title in December 2021 before losing the rematch. Pena then defeated Raquel Pennington in October to win the title Nunes vacated in retirement."", 'Adding some extra intrigue to Pena vs. Harrison is the looming return of Nunes, who has said she will end her retirement to face the winner.', ""With so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities."", 'With such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card. Here are your pick makers: Brent Brookhouse (Combat sports writer), Brian Campbell (Combat sports writer), Shakiel Mahjouri (writer), Michael Mormile (producer) and Brandon Wise (senior editor).', 'Campbell: Despite the much-publicized changes that a now-healthy O\'Malley has made in his personal life in order to leave no stone unturned ahead of this title rematch, Dvalishvili remains a very difficult style challenge for ""Suga."" Not only does the combination of Dvalishvili\'s insane cardio and the constant threat of the takedown aid the champion in keeping opponents out of rhythm, Dvalishvili\'s striking defense remains criminally underrated. Not only is Dvalishvili responsible defensively behind his high guard, he darts in and out so fluidly that the onus will remain on O\'Malley to take chances in order to chase him down. Dvalishvili is in the midst of a growingly historic run atop the 135-pound division and has plenty of momentum on his side. The champion also proved in his first title defense against unbeaten Umar Nurmagomedov that he can persevere despite his own pre-existing injuries. Merab is simply built different.', ""Brookhouse: I know the smart money is on Dvalishvili. His cardio and the pace he pushes are valuable assets and proved to be too much for O'Malley the first time around. I do, however, think that O'Malley is a very smart fighter and he seems to have taken the right lessons from the first fight. O'Malley and his team should have been working on ways to stay on his feet, off the cage and in position to use his striking. I believe O'Malley has the tools to get the finish if he gets rolling. Plus, what fun is a group of predictions if we all agree on every fight."", ""Mahjouri: I truly believe O'Malley will present a better second effort. Ignore the conspiracy theories about how the Sphere impacted the fight, but give some acknowledgment to O'Mally's torn labrum. Shoulder injuries are difficult to heal from, let alone fight with. O'Malley has made sweeping changes in his personal life. It may not matter on fight night, but it's clear he's taking his preparation extremely seriously. The problem is: so does Dvalishvili. The champ is not bulletproof, but his tenacity is an unsolved puzzle. If O'Malley doesn't land a fight-ending blow, Dvalishvili will find a way to survive, overcome, and win a decision. I think the champ goes 2-0 against O'Malley via decision."", ""Campbell: The overwhelming betting odds in favor of Harrison appear justified in this case. Pena owns a recognizable name and status as a two-time champion yet her gaping lack of elite wins remains an issue. The champion is tough as nails but doesn't have the requisite skills to prevent a power wrestler like Harrison from doing what she does best. Yes, Harrison will need to prove she can make 135 pounds for the third time and that comes with heavy physical demands. But few fighters are as driven as Harrison in a fight which could lead to Amanda Nunes coming out of retirement for a superfight against her former teammate. "", ""Mahjouri: Pena will have a terrible night if Harrison gets her hands on her. Two-time Olympic champion Harrison is one of the fiercest grapplers women's MMA has ever seen. Pena's 23% takedown defense is atrocious, and she's been submitted twice. Amanda Nunes took her down six times in their last fight. Not only is Pena's grappling defense shoddy, but she also lacks the striking power or finesse to disincentivize Harrison. The champ's only avenue to winning is by exhausting Harrison. It's a real possibility considering Harrison's admittedly treacherous weight cuts. Harrison has fought five rounds twice, splitting wins with Larissa Pacecho, but those were up two weight classes. Still, that's not enough to make me side against Harrison, who probably submits Pena."", ""Brookhouse: Bautista can absolutely win this fight, and if he does, it won't be pretty. When Bautista is most effective, he's shutting down opponents with an ugly, grinding style. Mix is the more dynamic fighter of the two, and that should serve him well to avoid getting put against the cage and held in position. Mix should be able to announce his arrival to the UFC with a competitive decision victory that sees him be too active for Bautista to shut down."", 'Mahjouri: You never quite know how well a Bellator star will do in the UFC, but Mix has top-five potential. Bautista, currently ranked No. 10 by the promotion, is a suitable first test, even on short notice. Mix is arguably the best bantamweight submission on the planet. That bodes well against Bautista, who was taken down by three of his last four opponents. I anticipate a tough and potentially anticlimactic fight, one where Mix gets his hand raised.

We’ll find out this Sat. night (June 7, 2025) inside Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, with Julianna Pena defending her 135-pound strap opposite Kayla Harrison in the UFC 316 co-main event, also scheduled for five, five-minute rounds.', 'That’s not all.', 'RELATED', 'Kelvin Gastelum will look to reestablish his place among the middleweight elite by turning away the brick-fisted stylings of 185-pound power puncher, Joe Pyfer. Elsewhere on the card, longtime Bellator MMA veteran Patchy Mix makes his Octagon debut against the rough-and-tumble Mario Bautista, while Vicente Luque continues his welterweight adventures opposite hot-and-cold “Trailblazer,” Kevin Holland. I’m not sure that’s a lineup that commands a $79.99 price tag, but we’re likely to get a couple of fun fights out of the ordeal, regardless if you’re at home or suffering through the noise at Buffalo Wild Wings.', 'Let’s break down the UFC 316 PPV main card.', 'RELATED', '135 lbs.: UFC Bantamweight Champion Merab “The Machine” Dvalishvili (13-4) vs. “Suga” Sean O’Malley (18-2, 1 NC)', 'Merab Dvalishvili soundly defeated Sean O’Malley to capture the bantamweight crown atop the UFC 306 lineup last fall in Las Vegas, and like any rematch, we have to look at what went wrong for the loser and what’s changed since they last fought to argue for a different outcome.', 'And uh ... all we got is “Well, Sean stopped smoking weed and quit social media.”', 'It’s not like O’Malley moved his camp to Dagestan and spent three years getting pummeled by the world’s best wrestlers before finally securing his rematch. No, he got hip surgery, watched Umar Nurmagomedov shit the bed at UFC 311, and went back into the gym with head coach Tim Welch to do exactly the same thing they did ahead of UFC 306.', 'Sans Instagram!', 'Henry Cejudo, an Olympic gold medalist, had no answer for Dvalishvili’s wrestling at UFC 298. Nurmagomedov was out-wrestled 7-2 in takedowns. Petr Yan was floored nearly a dozen times in his Dvalishvili fight at UFC Las Vegas but somehow O’Malley is going to transform himself in eight months, not including the time spent recovering from surgery.', 'How does scrapping weed improve your takedown defense?', ""Every fighter is beatable — including Dvalishvili. “The Machine” blanked Frankie Saenz in takedowns 11-0 and still lost a split decision at UFC Fresno. Ricky Simon played matador and strangled the incoming Georgian at UFC Atlantic City, so it can be done. It just hasn't happened in over seven years and Dvalishvili has been facing the best bantamweights in the world on a consistent basis."", 'O’Malley is unquestionably the superior striker and has knockout power; but one of the big problems facing “Suga,” is that Dvalishvili’s unrelenting attack robs him of the ability to set up his strikes — and low kicks are practically out of the question against a wrestler of this caliber. The challenger’s long, lean frame makes him a fluid striker and also sitting duck. “The Machine” is simply too strong to be stymied by the standard sprawl (or wall defense).', 'Perhaps the promotion rebooked this bout so quickly because it wants to squeeze whatever juice is left from the O’Malley fig tree. You can also argue there is no one left to fight. Cory Sandhagen and Song Yadong are both ranked in the Top 5 but that could be a tough sell considering PPV events cost $79.99 plus a subscription to the ESPN+ digital network.', 'We can worry about that after UFC 316.', 'The facts are these: Dvalishvili is an unstoppable wrestler with otherworldly cardio fighting a flashy striker he already whooped eight months ago. There is absolutely no reason to think history will not repeat itself, unless “The Machine” does something stupid like abandon his wrestling and try to finish O’Malley on the feet, as promised back in April.', 'Not likely.', 'Prediction: Dvalishvili def. O’Malley by unanimous decision', '135 lbs.: UFC Women’s Bantamweight Champion Julianna “The Venezuelan Vixen” Pena (12-5) vs. Kayla Harrison (18-1)', 'Julianna Pena has some of the worst striking I’ve ever seen in combat sports. Borderline embarrassing. And yet “The Venezuelan Vixen” is the bantamweight champion of the world, because Pena is able to compensate for her shortcomings on the feet with a ferocious ground attack, a granite chin, and five-round cardio. Outside of Amanda Nunes, there are no bantamweights with one-punch knockout power, including challenger Kayla Harrison, so Pena can afford to eat some punches to secure an advantageous position in the clinch, or against the fence, or even to set up a takedown.', 'Under normal circumstances.', 'Unfortunately for the champion, her strongest attributes are what carried Harrison to a pair of Olympic gold medals, as well as a world title under the PFL banner. Pena will not be able to bully Harrison or drown her in the championship rounds, even with the challenger’s daunting weight cut. And let’s face it, neither combatant feels comfortable on the feet so this one is going to be decided on the ground.', 'That’s bad news for Pena, who’s been out-wrestled five times in her UFC career.', 'We can’t overlook Harrison’s loss to Larissa Pacheco back in late 2022 and I’m sure Team Pena has been studying that tape. At the same time, claiming it “exposed” the Olympian feels like a copout in terms of criticism, because it undercuts the skills of Pacheco. Ask Cris Cyborg if she wants to rematch Pacheco after barely squeaking by her fellow Brazilian at “Battle of the Giants” last fall, a decision that broke Pacheco’s 10-fight winning streak.', 'Larissa belongs in UFC (again), but that’s a separate conversation.', 'I don’t see a path to victory for Pena outside of her stopping Harrison’s mug-and-slug attack and hoping the judges lean in her favor. I don’t want to go too crazy over her Pennington performance because it followed a two-year layoff, though it really doesn’t matter. Everything “The Venezuelan Vixen” does, Harrison does a lot better, almost like she’s Pena’s final form. I also think the challenger is angry after all that shit Pena was talking, so expect her to make a statement on Saturday night in “The Garden State.”', 'Prediction: Harrison def. Pena by submission', '185 lbs.: Kelvin Gastelum (19-9, 1 NC) vs. Joe “Bodybagz” Pyfer (13-3)', 'Kelvin Gastelum has been a problem for a lot of big name fighters over the years and consistently over-performs when he’s the odds-on underdog, starting with his upset win to stymie Uriah Hall in The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) 17 finale back in 2013. Gastelum went on to retire Michael Bisping and nearly turned the middleweight division upside down with his UFC 236 performance against a prime Israel Adesanya. More importantly, at least for this contest, is that Gastelum has never been knocked out in 29 professional fights and has faced some heavy-handed sluggers along the way, including Jared Cannonier and Robert Whittaker, among others.', 'Even though he’s been competing inside the Octagon for over a decade, Gastelum is still just 33 years old. That makes him younger than several fighters in the UFC 316 lineup, including co-headliners Julianna Pena and Kayla Harrison. From the outside looking in, it would appear Gastelum never mastered the psychological components necessary to reach the pinnacle of the sport, evidence by his never-ending weight struggles and inconsistent performances. A trip back to welterweight ended with a submission loss to Sean Brady; which to be fair, is not anything to be ashamed of considering Brady is ranked No. 2 in the world, though I’m sure his rebound victory over Daniel Rodriguez at UFC Saudi Arabia convinced Gastelum that middleweight is where he belongs.', 'Joe Pyfer will look to prove him wrong in his quest to become a bona fide contender at 185 pounds. “Bodybagz” lost some of his shine when he got shut down by Swedish veteran Jack Hermansson atop the UFC Vegas 86 fight card back in 2024. That performance raised a couple of red flags (“fraud check” as the kids would call it) because Pyfer seemed to have no Plan B after failing to land the knockout blow. I’m not sure the former “Contender Series” standout needs to worry about getting picked apart by Gastelum, but the granite-chinned TUF champ does have other ways to frustrate Pyfer and shut down his heavy-handed offense. What happens after that is likely to determine the outcome of this fight, and don’t be surprised to see this bout decided by who lands the timeliest takedowns.', ""Pyfer strangled Abdul Razak Alhassan by way of arm-triangle choke at UFC Vegas 80 so he’s not the one-trick pony some fans make him out to be — and Gastelum has been tapped three times in his MMA career (including an arm-triangle choke by Chris Weidman). It's hard to pick against Gastelum because he’s such a stubborn mule inside the cage, I just think the younger (28 year-old) Pyfer, even without the knockout punch, is going to be the busier striker. And even if he’s spending more time defending the takedown than working the body, he only needs to win two of the three rounds to go home victorious."", 'Prediction: Pyfer def. Gastelum by decision', '135 lbs.: Mario Bautista (15-2) vs. Patrick “Patchy” Mix (20-1)', 'Bellator MMA finally collapsed under the weight of its own pointlessness and PFL, for reasons still not fully understood, swooped in with some of its Saudi funny money to pay for the funeral. As a result, some of the world’s best fighters not employed by UFC finally get a chance to strut their stuff on the biggest stage in combat sports, and it’s hard to see the addition of Patchy Mix as anything but a win for both parties. Let’s face it, the bantamweight division is about one or two fights away from being cleaned out by Merab Dvalishvili, so having Mix as a viable contender extends the shelf life of “The Machine,” at least in terms of public interest.', 'I’m sure there are reservations about how well Mix will perform outside the confines of the Bellator cage after watching Michael Chandler self destruct. In addition, Patricio Freire also made the jump at UFC 314 and came up short against Yair Rodriguez. To be fair, Rodriguez is ranked No. 4 in the world and “Pitbull,” who turns 38 in just a few weeks, was coming off a 13-month layoff. Mix, by comparison, is still competing in his athletic prime at 31 and brings a 20-1 record into the promotion with 15 finishes. More importantly, he’s paired off with the unranked Mario Bautista, who is certainly an established veteran after six years under the UFC banner, but not the caliber of opponent that would have Mix fans jumping ship.', ""The Brazilian is currently the -180 betting favorite and matches up to Bautista fairly evenly in both height and reach. Mix will be fighting southpaw against a switch stance for the UFC vet and this three-rounder is likely to come down to who has the better grappling. There’s no question Bautista has faced stiffer competition throughout his career, going toe-to-toe with top stars like Jose Aldo and Cory Sandhagen, I just don't think the disparity is great enough to pick him based on that alone. I would, however, anticipate a very close fight with Mix taking home the “W” by getting the better of the frequent grappling exchanges."", 'Prediction: Mix def. Bautista by decision', '170 lbs: Vicente “Silent Assassin” Luque (23-10-1) vs. Kevin “Trailblazer” Holland (27-13, 1 NC)', 'Longtime welterweight veteran Vicente Luque is 2-1 since returning from his year-long medical suspension, which came in the wake of his Geoff Neal loss at UFC Vegas 59. His bounce-back fight resulted in a decision victory over an old and shopworn Rafael dos Santos, a career lightweight, before the “Silent Assassin” was stopped by Joaquin Buckley at UFC Atlantic City. I was ready to write him off at that point, but Luque — still just 33 years old — rebounded with a submission victory over Themba Gorimbo at UFC 310 to close out his 2024 fight campaign. Luque has bagged nine post-fight performance bonuses over the course of his UFC career with four “Fight of the Night” honors. Win or lose, the Brazilian comes to fight and has endeared himself to even the most fickle fight fans over the years.', 'Like his UFC 316 opponent, Kevin Holland also has nine post-fight performance bonuses and is coming off a rebound victory of his own. Following consecutive losses to Roman Dolidze (UFC 307) and Reinier de Ridder (UFC 311), the 32 year-old “Trailblazer” outworked Icelandic assassin Gunnar Nelson at UFC London back in March. It seems like a zillion years since Holland was a fresh-faced recruit on Season 2 of Dana White’s “Contender Series” and across a span of seven years, Holland has racked up an incredible 25 fights with a 15-10 record. Offensively, the former Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) headliner can do it all. He’s got power in his hands, sneaky submissions, and championship cardio — leading to 22 finishes in 27 career wins. Unfortunately, his takedown defense is a major liability and one of the main contributors to his losses over the years.', 'That’s pretty much the story of this fight. Holland has a whopping 81-inch reach and stands four inches taller than Luque, which could turn their PPV curtain jerker into a shooting gallery for “Trailblazer.” The more likely scenario is that “Silent Assassin” defaults to his wrestling, like he did against Dos Anjos (Luque scored eight takedowns in that fight). That’s assuming the Brazilian doesn’t get seduced by Jersey’s Just Bleed’rs and in turn let his Holland contest devolve into a sloppy bar fight. If so, he’s getting KTFO.', 'I’m playing it safe for this pick.', 'Prediction: Luque def. Holland by submission', 'CHAMPIONSHIP DOUBLE-DIP!

This is O'Malley's first fight since the loss. Dvalishvili, ESPN's No. 4-ranked men's pound-for-pound fighter, beat Umar Numagomedov by unanimous decision in his last fight."", ""In the co-main event, Julianna Peña puts her women's bantamweight title on the line against Kayla Harrison.

Harrison, ESPN's No. 4-ranked women's P4P fighter, enters the fight following a unanimous decision win over Ketlen Vieira. Harrison is a former two-time PFL champion."", 'Brett Okamoto spoke to former UFC fighters Din Thomas and Anthony Smith to get their main event predictions. ESPN betting expert Ian Parker adds insight and analysis on the main event and other intriguing bets he likes on the card.', 'This [pick] has nothing to do with O\'Malley. I just think in order to beat Merab, you have to be the bantamweight version of the late Anthony ""Rumble"" Johnson. There has to be that one-punch, shut-off power. O\'Malley fights so well at range, but I don\'t think Merab is going to give him space to do what he does best. -- Anthony Smith', ""It will be slightly closer and more competitive than their first [fight], but I think Merab's intensity will be a little too much for O'Malley. And ultimately, O'Malley won't be able to stay off his back. -- Din Thomas"", 'Odds accurate as of June. For the most up-to-date odds, visit ESPN BET.', ""Parker: Dvalishvili to win by decision (-170). It is hard to imagine this rematch going any differently than the first fight. Since then, Dvalishvili has defended successfully against an elite fighter in Nurmagomedov, while O'Malley has sat idly, hoping for this opportunity. Unless O'Malley catches the champ off guard and puts him away, I expect this to be a typical Dvalishvili fight. Look for him to shoot continuous takedowns and apply pressure at a menacing pace for all five rounds. To make the price more manageable, you can take Dvalishvili to win by decision."", ""Julianna is going to spend too much time trying to wrestle, and it's not going to work. She'll end up on her back, where I see her eating a few too many elbows. -- Din Thomas"", ""I think Julianna fights a lot in the gray areas, punching into clinches and takedowns. I don't think she can win those situations and win enough of those moments to beat Kayla. I think it'll be competitive at times and Julianna will attack Kayla's gas tank, but Kayla will win more moments over the course of five rounds. -- Anthony Smith"", ""Parker: Under 4.5 rounds (+125). Harrison is the biggest betting favorite on the card, which is rare for the challenger in a title fight. Although Peña is tough, unless Harrison gasses out to the point that she can't land a takedown, it's hard to imagine her not finishing Peña. Once Harrison gets the fight to the mat, Peña will be in a world of trouble, fighting just to survive. At some point, Harrison's takedowns and top pressure will be too much."", ""Mix to win (-185). Mix is making his debut against Bautista, who is on a seven-fight winning streak. This matchup should feature plenty of fun grappling exchanges. If this fight stays on the feet, it's a coin toss. However, if Mix can put Bautista on his back, he will take over. Mix may be the best grappler in the world at 135 pounds, and I believe his skills will be on full display."", ""Spivac to win (-150). Spivac is a near -150 favorite, which is surprising, as I believe he should be a -200 or even heavier. On the feet, Spivac is the more skilled striker, and he has an excellent ground game that Cortes-Acosta won't be able to defend. As long as Spivac stays away from Cortes-Acosta's power, he should be able to close the distance and utilize his grappling advantage to get the win."", '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iMkNnNTFRMDlFTFY5SFpFcFVXSFZqVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWd1QkVwYm9uU2s5NC1wYWd3=-w280-h168-p-df

Here’s a look at all the betting line movements for Merab Dvalishvili vs. Sean O’Malley 2 and much more.', 'UFC 316 takes place this weekend (Sat., June 7, 2025) inside Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The pay-per-view (PPV) main event features Merab Dvalishvili vs. Sean O’Malley 2 for the Bantamweight belt.', 'UFC 316’s co-main event is Julianna Pena vs. Kayla Harrison for the company’s women’s Bantamweight title. The PPV main card also has Kelvin Gastelum vs. Joe Pyfer, Kevin Holland vs. Vicente Luque and Mario Bautista vs. Patchy Mix.', 'UFC 316’s “Prelims” are headlined by Joshua Van vs. Bruno Silva. The undercard also has Wang Cong vs. Ariane da Silva and Quillan Salkilld vs. Yanal Ashmouz.', 'I’ve been watching the lines (see them here) for all the fights on UFC 316 and tracking the changes to see which fighters the betting public are siding with. Below, you’ll find all the line movement info since the odds were released (per Best Fight Odds).', 'RELATED', 'The lines were very interesting the first time these two met. Dvalishvili opened at -198 for that fight, but the public bet him up to +105. O’Malley, meanwhile, opened at +164 before closing at +100, making the fight a pick ‘em. The fight did not play out like a pick ‘em, though. It’s safe to say that Vegas were right about that one and the public, which largely threw down on the very popular O’Malley, were dead wrong.', 'RELATED', 'This time around, Vegas has again set Dvalishvili as the favorite (a heavier favorite). However, the public haven’t changed that one bit. It seems like all that faith in O’Malley has evaporated in the nine months since these two faced each other. And you can understand why, given how easy Dvalishvili found it to take and hold O’Malley down.', 'The public have been wrong to fade Dvalishvili a lot recently. When he fought Umar Nurmagomedov, he opened at +142 and then closed at +240. I thought Dvalishvili bossed that fight and don’t believe the narrative around it being a “very close decision.” Dvalishvilli opened at +150 and closed at +220 for his fight with Petr Yan, too.', 'The public has mostly backed O’Malley. He’s seen his favorite line shorten in all his fights back until he fought Andre Soukamthath (where he opened at -260 and closed at -145). In both his professional losses (to Dvalishvili and Marlon Vera) he saw his line flip from positive odds to negative odds. In that first Vera fight, he opened at +185 and then closed at -275 (another case of Vegas being right and the public being wrong when it comes to Suga).', 'Vegas has been pretty locked in on these O’Malley fights. If they are right again, then he’s going to lose this rematch and find himself out in the cold at Bantamweight.', 'RELATED', 'This line is behaving as you’d expect it. Harrison opened as the big favorite with -590 odds and that his grown to close to -800. Interestingly, the major shift in this line didn’t happen until around June 3. Harrison’s line has been slowly shortening and then it just dropped of a cliff, moving from -634 to -762 in a couple of days. That represents some big money coming in on Harrison this week.', 'This is nothing new for Harrison. She opened at -649 for her fight with Ketlen Vieira and closed at a ridiculous -1000 (before being quite uninspiring in the actual fight itself). In her debut with Holly Holm, her line was a bit more reserved. She opened at -310 and closed at -430. That likely represents the fact that not many folks were familiar with her rep when she came into UFC.', 'Pena does her best work as an underdog.', 'She’s won UFC’s Bantamweight title twice in her career as a dog. In 2021, she beat Amanda Nunes at +700 odds (after opening at +500). When she beat Raquel Pennington, she closed at +140, regardless of what Dana White thought about that decision.', 'Does Pena shock us all, again, by coming through as the underdog? Or, will things play out how Vegas assumes, with Harrison trouncing her and taking her belt?', 'RELATED', 'RELATED', 'The last time these two were booked for UFC Mexico City in March (details here), Gastelum opened at +400 and was bet all the way down to +250 by folks who believed he was too good to be exposed by a very untested Pyfer.', 'Count me among those folks.', 'This time around, Gastelum has opened at +295 and the public are pushing his line the other way. That’s great news if, like me, you still believe Gastelum is a very live dog in this fight.', 'These opening lines for Gastelum are the highest he’s seen in his UFC career. The only time he’s ever been close to them is when he was +220 against Uriah Hall in The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) 17 Finale.', 'And we all remember what happened there.', 'RELATED', 'Pyfer has been the favorite in all of his UFC fights since coming off Contender Series. Interestingly, he opened as the underdog in both his Contender Series fights, which he won (over Ozzy Diaz and Dustin Stoltzfus). In his only professional loss to Jack Hermansson, he opened at -192 and was bet down to -245.', 'RELATED', 'There’s not much change in this line. I’m a little surprised to see Bautista open as the underdog. I think he will lose this fight, but I thought the Bellator bias on Mix might have him open as an underdog. Vegas are respecting Mix’s past body of work, though (as it should). Despite that, the public are a little unsure. He opened at -205 and that’s lengthened a little. It’s trending up at this time of writing, though.', 'The public has been hit and miss on Bautista as of late. They were right to take his line from -175 to -120 against Jose Aldo. But, they were wrong to push his line from -110 to +160 against Ricky Simon.', 'I think this is a hard fight to pick, but I think the public might be wrong in fading Mix (presumably because they’re unfamiliar with his game).', 'RELATED', 'Luque is one of the biggest risers on this card. He opened with very modest +150 odds (to Holland’s -200), but that is steadily climbing.', 'The public nailed it with Luque in his last fight. Vegas had him opening as a +175 underdog against the -250 Themba Gorimbo. The public brought his line down to +145, though, and then enjoyed him choking Gorimbo out cold in the first.', 'The public were right about Luque in his previous fight, too, against Joaquin Buckley. He opened as the -162 favorite in that fight and was bet down to -122. Buckley would then get the ground-and-pound win.', 'The public have been right on Holland lately, too. The were right to back him against Gunnar Nelson and right to fade him against Reinier de Ridder and Roman Dolidze. And they were right to go all-in on him when he fought Michal Oleksiejczuk, too.', 'With the public showing a lot of accuracy on both these guys, these current lines might suggest that we’re going to see Luque on the wrong end of another beating.', 'RELATED', 'Betting on sports involves risk, so please only wager amounts you can afford to lose.

He would end up starching Durden with an uppercut in this fight.', 'Against Van, though — who fights with the kind of pressure Kape used to put away Silva — I think the public are right to fade him.', 'This will likely result in Van’s shortest odds of his UFC career.

The promotion has fathered some of the largest combat-sport stars of the 21st century, including Conor McGregor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Jon Jones.', 'There are plenty of ways to get in on the action every Saturday. FanDuel Sportsbook provides MMA odds including moneylines, round totals, and prop bets for each fight.', ""Without further delay, here are a few best bets from UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs. O'Malley 2, taking place at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on Saturday."", 'I love these results from my model. Rounded to 50.0%, you can flip a coin between Serghei Spivac and Waldo Cortes-Acosta, so it should be a great fight.', 'That leaves some unnerving value on ""Salsa Boy"". Cortes-Acosta hasn\'t faced a wrestling threat since a unanimous loss to Marcos Rogerio de Lima in August 2023. He surrendered three takedowns and 5:01 in control to de Lima, and Spivac\'s grappling analytics and credentials are superior.', 'However, controlling Robelis Despaigne (1-2 UFC) with three takedowns for north of nine minutes was an encouraging sign that WCA is rounding out his grappling skills in addition to a boxing background. His last effort, a +43 striking differential and Round 2 knockout of Ryan Spann (8-6 UFC), was one of his best yet.', ""Spivac's 48% striking D has wilted before, and he's just 2-4 against currently ranked heavyweights."", ""Betting markets dictated my action on this bout. Waldo was -102 on Sunday, and anyone who reads my column weekly knows that I'm not just willing to but love to fade the consensus hive mind that inflates lines off tape study throughout the week."", '23-year-old Joshua Van has become a diehard fan favorite. This line is still ridiculous.', ""In July 2024, Van was a consensus -245 favorite over Charles Johnson (6-5 UFC) before dropping the first round and getting knocked out cold in Round 3. Johnson's ordinary results since that fight don't inspire hope that Van should be a prohibitive favorite inside the rankings against Bruno Silva."", '""Bulldog"" was bested by flyweight\'s next title challenge, Manel Kape, last December in Tampa. He\'s still the flyweight rankings\' leader in knockdown rate (2.17 KD%) and stopped Cody Durden (6-5-1 UFC) with punches just 11 months ago. Van didn\'t finish Durden despite a +95 striking differential, showing these two\'s gap in power.', ""The Brazilian underdog will always have a puncher's chance, and this is the first true test of Van's chin since that shocking loss by knockout."", ""I've modeled Silva 41.9% likely to win this fight, and 28.8% of the time, it comes via knockout. I have to take this small value sprinkle when Van's fan-friendly aura has inflated this line."", 'Outside of Joe Pyfer getting food poisoning, nothing has changed in my analysis of this canceled matchup from UFC Mexico two months ago.', 'Pyfer\'s had enough time to fully recover and re-rack this stellar matchup for him. Kelvin Gastelum\'s latest failed foray to 170 pounds has forced him to 185 pounds, and UFC matchmakers clearly insist he fights Pyfer. ""Bodybagz"" is large for middleweight himself, so he\'ll enjoy five inches of height and four inches of reach over Gastelum.', ""The favorite simply has tools to finish this fight. His huge 1.56 KD% also has come with 0.90 submission attempts per 15 minutes. Even though Gastelum has never been knocked out as a pro, he's been submitted twice in his last seven fights."", ""My model prefers knockout (33.8%) to a submission (17.1%), but K.G.'s legendary durability is doing us a huge favor on this line. He's now 33 facing one of the division's most potent finishers, so this line should be closer to even money."", ""My model's criteria is 40 octagon minutes. I've pushed the boundaries in main events and title fights before to hit-and-miss success, but I do agree with its take here."", ""Julianna Pena is as tough as a two-dollar steak. She was submitted twice earlier in her 11-fight UFC career, but she's now survived or won over 58 consecutive minutes in title fights that weren't always going her way. Pulling off one of UFC's largest upsets ever against Amanda Nunes, counting her completely out against Kayla Harrison is foolish."", ""There's just a reason she's the card's largest underdog. Pena's 23% takedown D is horrendous, and Harrison, a former gold medalist in Judo, primarily wrestles. So far in UFC, Harrison has landed 2.75 takedowns per 15 minutes with 30% accuracy because she struggled -- as many have -- to crack Ketlen Vieira's 88% takedown D."", 'I just am not sure Harrison is this ""dominant finisher"" she\'s billed as in betting markets. She submitted 42-year-old Holly Holm in her UFC debut, but she\'s now gone the distance in four of her last seven including her time with PFL, which was against much worse competition.', 'This fight seems primed to become Harrison conserving energy from a massive weight cut with takedowns she easily gathers.', ""It might not be an entertaining bout if my model's result is correct. I've forecasted this fight going the distance in 75.8% of outcomes, and Harrison wins the decision 49.2% of the time."", ""Even after watching Merab Dvalishvili not really break a sweat to beat Sean O'Malley last September, that betting line was more appropriate than this one."", 'Excuses fly after fighters lose, but O\'Malley did go under the knife for a shoulder injury that likely didn\'t help him grapple. With that said, ""Suga"" was still just one convincing round from actually retaining his title, winning the first and fifth round on a majority of cards. It\'s because Merab just doesn\'t put enough offense out there to ever justify a betting line like this.', ""Dvalishvili was an underdog in his first two title bouts, which made a pedestrian 4.36 significant strikes landed per minute more tolerable. Even after 25 minutes of disappointment, O'Malley's +3.22 striking success rate (SSR) towers over Merab's (+1.85) and shows how comfortably he wins a few minutes that stay at distance."", ""Merab can win holding people. It's just a dangerous game to play as judging criteria continues to favor damage over control."", 'Quietly, ""The Machine"" is also 34 years old, and his style is not one that, typically, ages gracefully. O\'Malley -- right at the historical median championship age of 30 -- seems to be maturing and improving.', ""Before September's bout, I had O'Malley a favorite to win 61.5% of the time. His performance there has knocked him back to 51.9%, but this line is a wild overreaction."", ""There also wasn't any sort of moment of danger for either guy in the first bout, so this fight going to the distance 77.8% of the time in the model also invites a play on Suga's decision prop."", 'New to FanDuel Sportsbook?
