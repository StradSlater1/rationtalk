First Evidence of a Sauropod's Last Meal Shows How They Ate Their Food,https://www.sciencealert.com/first-evidence-of-a-sauropods-last-meal-shows-how-they-ate-their-food,"['Since the late 19th century, sauropod dinosaurs (long-necks like Brontosaurus and Brachiosaurus) have been almost universally regarded as herbivores, or plant eaters.', 'However, until recently, no direct evidence – in the form of fossilised gut contents – had been found to support this.', 'I was one of the palaeontologists on a dinosaur dig in outback Queensland, Australia, that unearthed ""Judy"": an exceptional sauropod specimen with the fossilised remains of its last meal in its abdomen.', 'In a new paper published today in Current Biology, we describe these gut contents while also revealing that Judy is the most complete sauropod, and the first with fossilised skin, ever found in Australia.', 'Remarkably preserved, Judy helps to shed light on the feeding habits of the largest land-living animals of all time.', ""Sauropod dinosaurs dominated Earth's landscapes for the entire 130 million years of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Along with many other species, they died out in the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago."", 'Ever since the first reasonably complete sauropod skeletons were found in the 1870s, the hypothesis that they were herbivores has rarely been contested. Simply put, it is hard to envisage sauropods eating anything other than plants.', 'Their relatively simple teeth were not adapted for tearing flesh or crushing bone. Their small brains and ponderous pace would have prevented them from outsmarting or outpacing most potential prey.', 'And to sustain their huge bodies, sauropods would have had to eat regularly and often, necessitating an abundant and reliable food source – plants.', 'Although the general body plan of sauropods seems pretty uniform – stocky, on all fours, with long necks – these behemoths did vary when we look more closely.', 'Some had squared-off snouts with tiny, rapidly replaced teeth confined to the front of the mouth. Others had rounded snouts, with much more robust teeth, arranged in a row that extended farther back in the mouth. Neck length varied greatly (with some necks up to 15 metres long), as did neck flexibility. In addition, a few of them had taller shoulders than hips.', 'Absolute size varied too – some were less enormous than others. All of these factors would have constrained how high above ground each species could feed and which plants they could reach.', 'Sauropod discoveries are becoming more regular in outback Queensland, thanks largely to the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum in Winton.', ""In 2017, I helped the museum unearth a roughly 95-million-year-old sauropod, nicknamed Judy after the museum's co-founder Judy Elliott."", ""We soon realised this find was extraordinary. Besides being the most complete sauropod skeleton and skin ever found in Australia, Judy's belly region hosted a strange rock layer. It was about two square metres in area and ten centimetres thick on average, chock-full of fossil plants."", ""The fact this plant-rich layer was confined to Judy's abdomen and located on the inside surface of the fossil skin, made us wonder – had we unearthed the remains of Judy's last meal or meals?"", 'If so, we knew we had something special on our hands: the first sauropod gut contents ever found.', ""Analysis of Judy's skeleton, which was prepared out of the surrounding rock by volunteers in the museum's laboratory, enabled us to classify her as a Diamantinasaurus matildae."", ""We scanned portions of Judy's gut contents with X-rays at the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne and at CSIRO in Perth, and with neutrons at Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in Sydney."", 'This enabled us to digitally visualise the plants – which were preserved as voids within the rock – without destroying them.', 'We did destructively sample some small portions of the gut contents to figure out their chemical make-up, along with the skin and surrounding rock.', ""This revealed the gut contents were turned to stone by microbes in an acidic environment (stomach juices, perhaps), with minerals likely derived from the decomposition of Judy's own body tissues."", ""Judy's gut contents confirm that sauropods ate their greens but barely chewed them – their gut flora did most of the digestive work."", 'Most importantly, we can tell Judy ate bracts from conifers (relatives of modern monkey puzzle trees and redwoods), seed pods from extinct seed ferns, and leaves from angiosperms (flowering plants) just before she died.', 'Conifers then, as now, would have been huge, implying Judy fed well above ground level. By contrast, flowering plants were mostly low-growing in the mid-Cretaceous.', ""Based on other specimens (especially teeth), scientists previously thought Diamantinasaurus browsed plants relatively high off the ground. The conifer bracts in Judy's belly support this."", 'However, Judy was not fully grown when she died, and the angiosperms in her belly imply lower-level feeding, as well. It seems likely, then, that the diets of some sauropods changed slightly as they grew. Nevertheless, they were life-long vegetarians.', ""Judy's skin and gut contents are now on display at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum in Winton. I'm not sure how I'd feel about having the remains of my last meal publicly exhibited for all to see posthumously, but if it helped the cause of science, I think I'd be OK with it."", 'Stephen Poropat, Research Associate, School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Curtin University', 'This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Paleontologists dig through fossilized dino guts to see what’s inside,https://www.popsci.com/science/sauropod-stomach-contents/,"['BY LAURA BAISAS', 'PUBLISHED JUN 9, 2025 11:00 AM EDT', 'IMAGE: TRAVIS TISCHLER', 'Get the Popular Science daily newsletter💡', 'Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.', 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'Nothing quite fits the moniker “gentle giant” more than sauropods. These gargantuan dinosaurs  could reach up to 123 feet long and weigh up to seven tons. Sauropods have long been believed to be herbivores, munching on leaves during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. ', 'Now, for the first time, a team of paleontologists have studied the abdomen of a sauropod with its gut contents still intact that lived roughly 94 to 101 million years ago. The finding confirms that they were in fact herbivores–and did not really chew their food. Instead, sauropods relied on gut microbes to break down its food. The findings are detailed in a study published June 9 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology.', '“No genuine sauropod gut contents had ever been found anywhere before, despite sauropods being known from fossils found on every continent and despite the\u202fgroup being known to span at least 130 million years of time,” Stephen Poropat, a study co-author and paleontologist at Curtin University in Australia, said in a statement. “This finding confirms several hypotheses about the sauropod diet that had been made based on studies of their anatomy and comparisons with modern-day animals.” ', 'Fossilized dinosaur bones can only tell us so much about these extinct animals. Paleontologists can use trackways and footprints to learn about their movement and preserved gut contents called cololites to put together what their diets may have looked like. Understanding the diet is critical for understanding their biology and the role they played in\u202fancient ecosystems, but very few dinosaur fossils have been found with cololites. These are gut contents that have yet to become poop–or coprolites.', 'In particular, sauropod cololites have remained elusive. With their gargantuan sizes, these dinosaurs may have been the most ecologically impactful terrestrial herbivores on the planet during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. With this lack of direct dietary evidence, the  specifics of sauropod herbivory—including the plants that they ate—have mostly been theorized based largely on tooth wear, jaw shape and size, and neck length. ', 'But that changed in the summer of 2017. Staff and volunteers at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History were excavating a relatively complete subadult sauropod skeleton. This particular Diamantinasaurus matildae specimen lived during the mid-Cretaceous period and was uncovered in the Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia. The team noticed an unusual, fractured rock layer that appeared to contain the sauropod’s cololite with well-preserved plant fossils. ', 'The team analyzed the plant specimens within the cololite and found that sauropods likely only engaged in minimal oral processing of their food. Instead of chewing, their gut microbiota would ferment the plants to digest it. ', 'The cololite had a wide variety of plants, including foliage from conifers (cone-bearing seed plants), seed-fern fruiting bodies (plant structures that hold seeds), and leaves from angiosperms (flowering plants). From this, it looks like Diamantinasaurus was an indiscriminate, bulk feeder.  ', '“The plants within show evidence of having been severed, possibly bitten, but have not been chewed, supporting the hypothesis of bulk feeding in sauropods,” said Poropat.  ', 'The team also found chemical biomarkers of both angiosperms and gymnosperms—a group of woody, seed-producing plants that include conifers. ', '[ Related: The mystery of why some dinosaurs got so enormous. ]', '“This implies that at least some sauropods were not selective feeders, instead eating whatever plants they could reach and safely process,” Poropat said. “These findings largely corroborate past ideas regarding the enormous influence that sauropods must have had on ecosystems worldwide during the Mesozoic Era.” ', 'Although it was not unexpected that the gut contents provided support for sauropod herbivory and bulk feeding, Poropat was surprised to find angiosperms in the dinosaur’s gut. ', '“Angiosperms became approximately as diverse as conifers in Australia around 100 to 95 million years ago, when this sauropod was alive,” he says. “This suggests that sauropods had successfully adapted to eat flowering plants within 40 million years\u202fof the first evidence of the presence of these plants in the fossil record.” ', 'Based on these findings, the team suggests that Diamantinasaurus likely fed on both low- and high-growing plants, at least before adulthood. As hatchlings, sauropods would have only been able to access food that was close to the ground. As they grew (and grew and grew), their viable food options also expanded. ', 'Additionally, the prevalence of small shoots, bracts, and seed pods in the cololite implies that subadult Diamantinasaurus likely targeted new growth portions of conifers and seed ferns. These portions of the plant are easier to digest. ', 'According to the authors, the strategy of indiscriminate bulk feeding likely served sauropods well for 130 million years. However, as with most studies, there are some important caveats and limitations. ', '“The primary limitation of this study is that the sauropod gut contents we describe constitute a single data point,” Poropat explained. “These gut contents only tell us about the last meal or several meals of a single subadult sauropod individual.”', 'We also don’t know how the seasons affected diet, or if the plants preserved in this specific sauropod represent a diet typical of a healthy sauropod or a more stressed one. The specimen is also a subabult, which could mean that younger sauropods had this more than adults did.

It also appears that they were walking around with “gastric furnaces” that could break down food thanks to fermentation and microbes in the gut – no chewing required.', 'The fossilized stomach contents were retrieved from a Diamantinasaurus matildae specimen dating back between 94 and 101 million years that was excavated in 2017 by staff and volunteers at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History. Sauropods as a group span around 130 million years of time, but this one came from the Winton Formation of Queensland in Australia, home to animals that lived during the mid-Cretaceous.', 'The specimen was a remarkable one, near-complete, but it also came with a mysterious lump of rock. Closer inspection revealed it was a cololite, the fancy name for preserved stomach contents, with multiple layers of plant fossils embedded within it.', 'This marked the first time sauropod stomach contents had been found, which is sort of remarkable for an animal group as well-studied and long-lived (geologically speaking) as sauropods. Inside, they found fossil evidence of conifers, seed-fern fruiting bodies, and angiosperm leaves. It also showed that these animals didn’t really chew their food, instead relying on fermentation and the gut microbiome to break it all down.', 'The amount of heat a sauropod generated through fermentation would have been considerable.', 'Today we see this kind of digestion in large-bodied hindgut fermenters like elephants, rhinos, and horses.

We know it’s a process that creates heat, so does that mean…', '', '“The amount of heat a sauropod generated through fermentation would have been considerable,” said lead author Stephen Poropat of Curtin University to IFLScience. “Having a long neck and tail might have been a way to effectively dump heat (a la the ears of an elephant), and also to keep the brain away from their gastric furnace.”', 'Not only does this mark a world-first fossil discovery, but it also provides a new perspective on how these enormous dinosaurs with their bulk-eating appetites were shaping the prehistoric environment, not just as adults, but all throughout their lives.', ""“It's often easy to think of prehistoric animals as ‘their biggest adult selves’, but not as babies, juveniles or subadults,” added Poropat. “When you step back and think about it, though, sauropods must have imposed significant pressure on their environment even at a young age.”"", 'Sauropods would have been ecosystem engineers throughout their lives, no matter at what level(s) they fed.', ""“A horde of hatchlings would have been able to decimate tracts of low-growing plants pretty rapidly. Ravenous 'teenage' sauropods would have ravaged plants both low down, and as high as they could reach. The few of these that made it to adulthood would live to feed at the tops of trees, or continue feeding down low, vacuum-cleaner style (or somewhere in between those two extremes), thereby still putting pressure on their environment.”"", '“The impact that sauropod feeding had on plants in terms of pressuring them to develop defences (either physical or chemical), regrowing rapidly, or encapsulating their seeds in fruits or seed pods to entice or at least enable sauropods to disperse them as they roamed and defecated, is a marvellous subject to ponder.

The team who studied the dinosaur said it lived to a subadult age, meaning that it passed the juvenile state but died before reaching adulthood about 95 million years ago in the Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia.', 'The team named her Judy in their study published Monday in Current Biology. ', 'Knowing a dinosaur’s diet means understanding their biology and role in ancient ecosystems, especially for the gigantic sauropods — dinosaurs with long giraffe-esque necks that roamed the world throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.', 'But before the team found Judy’s fossilized gut contents, known as cololites, the scientific community based the theory of herbivorous sauropods on indirect evidence like tooth wear, jaw morphology and neck length. Sauropod cololites remained particularly elusive, though not for lack of effort per lead study author Stephen Poropat.', ""“I think that fossilized sauropod gut contents are genuinely rare in the fossil record, and that they would only fossilize under specific conditions,” said Poropat of Curtin University via email. “Judy's gut contents seem to have become phosphatized — mineralized, likely because of microbial action, using phosphate minerals. Plants are not particularly phosphate rich, so for them to fossilize in this way, the phosphates would have to derive from a different source. Judy's own body tissues seem to have provided the phosphates for this process, and the acidic environment these microbes generate enabled that phosphate to solidify with the plants within.”"", 'For that matter, the plants in Judy’s guts were severed, bitten, but not chewed, so the team thinks that sauropods like Judy mostly relied on fermentation and gut microbiota for digestion. Flowering plants called angiosperms laid in Judy’s guts, somewhat surprising Poropat.', '“About 95 million years ago when Judy was alive, angiosperms were quite abundant and diverse, and it would make sense for herbivores to adapt to eat them,” said Poropat via email. “My surprise stems from the fact that sauropods at that time might not have had that long to adapt to eating angiosperms, which appeared 30 million years before Judy died. Also, many angiosperms today have chemical defenses to dissuade animals from eating them, with some being fatal. It would not be surprising to learn that flowering plants from the Age of Dinosaurs had similar defenses. Whether Judy died from eating a plant that was toxic to her is, however, wild speculation.”', ""Speculation surrounds the Judy excavation. Poropat said that his team's study focused on one data point for an entire species, and the plants in Judy’s guts may have been an unusual last meal for a starving animal instead of a consistent part of her diet. So, the team hopes future studies will find more direct evidence to prove how sauropods survived for 130 million years."", 'As for the current work, Poropat credited everyone who worked on Judy, especially the volunteers and citizen scientists.', ""“It could not have happened without their efforts,” said Poropat via email. “Over 50 volunteers helped the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum to excavate Judy's remains, and most of her bones were prepared by volunteers at the museum’s laboratory as well. Knowing that this specimen will go on display in Winton, and that all those volunteers will be able to view it with their loved ones — either in person or in our publication — and proudly point to the bits they worked on is just wonderful.”"", 'Sign up for new weekly newsletter Closing Arguments to get the latest about ongoing trials, major litigation and hot cases and rulings in courthouses around the U.S. and the world.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXFhR1ZvWTB4c2RrWXdjVUZSVFJEaEFSaVFBeWdLTWdZQnA0aGhRZ1E=-w280-h168-p-df

Fossils in 100-Million-Year-Old Sauropod Suggest They Didn’t Chew Their Food,https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/fossils-in-100-million-year-old-sauropod-suggests-they-didnt-chew-their-food,"['Fossils found in the stomach of a 100-million-year-old sauropod reveal that these dinosaurs didn’t fully chew their food and relied on stomach microbes for digestion. ', 'A new study from Current Biology analyzed the fossilized abdomen of a sauropod. Within it were fossilized plants, which provided further evidence that these creatures were herbivores and barely chewed their food. ', '“No genuine sauropod gut contents had ever been found anywhere before, despite sauropods being known from fossils found on every continent and despite the\u202fgroup being known to span at least 130 million years of time,” said lead author Stephen Poropat of Curtin University in a press release. “This finding confirms several hypotheses about the sauropod diet that had been made based on studies of their anatomy and comparisons with modern-day animals.”', 'Understanding a dinosaur’s diet and eating habits is key to understanding the impact they had on the ecosystem. However, there are very few cololite (gut material) fossils, especially in sauropods, according to the study. ', 'It has mostly been assumed that these dinosaurs were herbivores, based on their long necks, the shape of their teeth, and jaw morphology. But with this recent finding, there is evidence to back up the herbivore theory. ', 'In 2017, a research group from the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History was excavating the fossil of a subadult Diamantinasaurus matildae, a mid-Cretaceous sauropod. The fossil had been uncovered in the Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia.', 'The research team began to notice a fractured rock layer, and within it, was the dinosaur’s cololite, which contained a plethora of fossilized plants. ', 'Read More: 236-Million-Year-Old Poop Fossil Reveals a Hidden Treasure — Oldest Evidence of Butterflies', 'After analyzing the cololite, the team concluded that this dinosaur likely only slightly chewed its food before swallowing. Because of this, the dinosaur probably relied on its stomach microbiota and fermentation to aid in digestion. ', 'From the fossils, the research team identified conifer foliage, seed fern, and angiosperm leaves — flowering plants. This leads researchers to think that D. matildae ate a wide variety of plants and a lot of them. ', '“The plants within show evidence of having been severed, possibly bitten, but have not been chewed, supporting the hypothesis of bulk feeding in sauropods,” said Poropat in the press release.', 'The team also identified the chemical biomarkers for angiosperms and gymnosperms, woody, seed-producing plants.', '“This implies that at least some sauropods were not selective feeders, instead eating whatever plants they could reach and safely process,” Poropat added in the press release. “These findings largely corroborate past ideas regarding the enormous influence that sauropods must have had on ecosystems worldwide during the Mesozoic Era.” ', 'Although it wasn’t surprising for the researchers to discover that the sauropod was a bulk eater, the angiosperms in the dinosaur’s gut were a surprise. ', '“Angiosperms became approximately as diverse as conifers in Australia around 100 [million] to 95 million years ago, when this sauropod was alive,” Poropat said in the press release. “This suggests that sauropods had successfully adapted to eat flowering plants within 40 million years\u202fof the first evidence of the presence of these plants in the fossil record.”', 'According to the study, the findings suggest that D. matildae ate vegetation that grew both high and low before adulthood. Which makes sense, and young sauropods could only reach so high. As they grew from hatchlings, their diets would have changed to include higher-growing vegetation. ', 'The ability to consume an array of vegetation may have helped these dinosaurs thrive for 130 million years. Though this is an incredible find that helps us understand a little more about sauropods, Poropat did point out a few things. ', '“The primary limitation of this study is that the sauropod gut contents we describe constitute a single data point. These gut contents only tell us about the last meal or several meals of a single subadult sauropod individual,” Poropat explained in the press release. ', ""“We don't know if the plants preserved in our sauropod represent its typical diet or the diet of a stressed animal. We also don't know how indicative the plants in the gut contents are of juvenile or adult sauropods, since ours is a subadult,\u202fand we don't know how seasonality might have affected this sauropod's diet,” Poropat concluded in the release.
