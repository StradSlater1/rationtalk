Jaire Alexander: Are NY Giants still the right fit for now-released Packers cornerback?,https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/nfl/giants/2025/06/09/jaire-alexander-release-green-bay-packers-new-york-giants/84112668007/,"['Jaire Alexander would have been an intriguing target for the Giants had he hit the market three months ago.', ""With the Green Bay Packers waiting to release the two-time Pro Bowl cornerback until now, that's no longer the case."", 'And this is certainly not an argument against the talent of Alexander, who would instantly bring the best resume of any defensive back on the roster to Big Blue. Sometimes the timing of personnel decisions such as these - with the importance of looking in the mirror and being realistic about where the Giants are - can trump everything else.', 'Here is what you need to consider when suggesting Alexander as a possible fit for the Giants:', 'The Packers view themselves as Super Bowl contenders. They are much closer to being a playoff mainstay and with that comes with the challenge of not just competing to beat out the reigning champion Eagles and the Commanders, but the Lions in their own division, the NFL North.', 'So this is a statement Green Bay is making about where Alexander is, and that comes down to cost versus value. At 28 years old, Alexander has entered the territory where his availability due to injury concerns is being questioned.', 'He played just seven games last year and has missed a total of 20 games over the past two seasons.', ""The Giants are about to face the toughest schedule in the NFL - based on last season's records - so the immediate reaction when a player of Alexander's resume is about to hit the market is only natural. Why shouldn't the Giants take on a player who has done more in the league than any at his position on the current roster?"", ""Well, it's not that simple if the Giants are being honest with themselves. This isn't about giving up on the upcoming season. There's no question coach Brian Daboll will have this locker room believing its underdog status won't stand in the way of the Giants figuring out a way to stun the NFL and have a good season, much like they did in Daboll's first season in '22."", ""But investing in Alexander when you have already committed to Paulson Adebo to be your top corner with Tae Banks and Cor'Dale Flott - important draft picks for general manager Joe Schoen and this current regime - facing important campaigns for their tenure here."", ""For the Giants - and it's still early - but I think they want to position themselves to get the best out of Banks. Part of that was bringing in Adebo, obviously. Another aspect of this quest: making sure Flott is available to push Banks."", ""I'm still not giving up on Flott, a third-round pick in Schoen's first class who came into the league having just turned 20. The Giants are going through spring practices with Adebo as the No. 1 corner, and Banks and Flott both worked with the first team in the sessions open to the media."", ""This secondary should be improved, and the presence of Adebo and safety Jevon Holland should help the overall depth and impact. Dru Phillips should man the nickel spot from jump, and Tyler Nubin is also positioned to take a leap pairing with Holland in his second year. Dane Belton, another member of Schoen's first class, is off to a strong start this spring as well."", ""If this were three months ago, Alexander is someone I would have strongly considered. I don't think there's any question he will have a solid market with contenders looking for that final piece in the secondary. You can never have enough corners, this is true, but there needs to be perspective."", 'I could see the Vikings wanting to keep Alexander in the NFC North and giving Brian Flores another toy to play with on the back end. The 49ers have the cap space and an opening, and Alexander, if healthy, could really move the needle for San Francisco which has fallen behind in the NFC West a bit. Could the rich get richer with the Eagles making a play for Alexander to boost a group headed by Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean? Is Alexander looking to chase a ring?', 'And this would be the most intriguing for me: the Dolphins can finally trade Jalen Ramsey and sign Alexander to take his spot.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXJVM0oxYkU0M1FURllSakZFVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZEZZYk1LUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

However, he hasn’t been particularly healthy as of late.

There’s also the issue of his ugly departure from Green Bay, which saw him suspended by the team and skipping offseason workouts this summer.', 'So, should the Patriots make a call to inquire about the 28-year-old cornerback? They certainly have the chips to make that sort of gamble without going all in.', 'It’s hard to imagine the Patriots offering Alexander a major long-term deal after seeing him flame out on Green Bay. Meanwhile, the cornerback’s stock is at an all-time low.', 'A one-year “prove it” deal might be attractive for both sides. It would give Alexander a chance to reset his market and try to draw one more major free-agent contract. Meanwhile, the Patriots still have plenty of money to spend this year. According to Over the Cap, New England still has a league-high $60.4 million in cap space.', 'Alexander is an excellent cornerback and could help the Patriots build an elite group in the secondary. Mike Vrabel’s team already has plenty to work with in the form of rising star Christian Gonzalez and top free agent Carlton Davis.', 'But after that, there are some question marks. Marcus Jones has shown promise, but is undersized and has injury concerns of his own. Beyond Jones, there’s a serious drop off, with options including the likes of Alex Austin, Marcellas Dial and rookie Craig Woodson in the slot.', 'Adding Alexander would give New England an elite trio of cornerbacks, which is something teams need in the modern wide-open era of the NFL.', '', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Jaire Alexander release makes Packers’ salary cap situation in 2026 much clearer,https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2025/6/9/24445898/packers-jaire-alexander-release-salary-cap-impact-2025-2026-free-agency-extensions-zach-tom,"['FILED UNDER:', 'For better or worse, this weekend’s decision frees up significant financial flexibility for the next two years.', 'The impending release of Jaire Alexander came as a bit of a surprise to many Green Bay Packers fans after the team and the player had seemed to be working towards a new agreement. However, a look at the salary cap implications of the Packers moving on from Alexander illustrates why the team was willing to stand its ground with the embattled and injury-prone cornerback, even if it meant they got no other compensation in return.', 'In examining the cap impact of Alexander’s contract and release, the Packers suddenly have a significant amount of added flexibility for the 2026 season, which they will need with a handful of young players ready to get paid as they head towards free agency next offseason.', 'The Packers signed Alexander to a 4-year contract extension in May of 2022, signing him through the 2026 season. That contract included a $30 million signing bonus and multiple roster bonuses that the Packers elected to convert to signing bonuses in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the 2025 and 2026 seasons were structured for just this possibility — no roster bonuses were included, and all of the cash to be paid in each of those seasons was non-guaranteed, in the form of base salary, workout bonuses, and per-game roster bonuses.', 'Here are the breakdowns of the remaining years on Alexander’s deal, as reported by Overthecap.com:', 'Base salary: $16.5 million\nWorkout bonus: $700k\nPer-game roster bonuses: $650k\nAmortized signing bonus: $7.5 million\nTotal salary cap hit: $24.64 million', 'Base salary: $18.15 million\nWorkout bonus: $700k\nPer-game roster bonuses: $650k\nAmortized signing bonus: $7.5 million\nTotal salary cap hit: $27.02 million', 'Void year\nAmortized signing bonus: $2 million', 'By releasing Alexander after June 1st, the Packers will only be on the hook for keeping his 2025 signing bonus money (just over $7.5 million) as dead money on the 2025 salary cap. The remaining signing bonus money — a shade more than $9.5 million covering both 2026 and the 2027 void year — will hit the cap next year, in 2026.', 'As a result, the Packers will reduce their salary cap number by just over $17.1 million this season and approximately $17.5 million next year. That’s a total of $34.6 million in cap space opened up over two years, which will have a massive impact. For the coming 2025 season, the Packers are doing just fine; prior to Alexander’s release, they were carrying roughly $29 million in cap space, and this transaction will put them at around $46 million under the cap.', '2026 had been a different story, however. Using a projected $295.5 million base cap number, Overthecap.com had estimated the Packers to be about $10 million over the cap prior to rollover from this year’s unused cap space. Now the team will be around $7.5 million under the projected 2026 cap, even before accounting for any rollover cap space or any adjustments to large contracts like those of Kenny Clark, Rashan Gary, or Elgton Jenkins.', 'With Zach Tom likely to get a new deal sometime this fall — perhaps in the $20 million per year range — and the team still looking to extend linebacker Quay Walker, Green Bay is likely to eat into that remaining cap space quickly. Releasing Alexander ensures that the Packers have plenty of flexibility to get those deals done while also maintaining the ability to be a major player in the 2026 free agent market.', 'Even if the Packers get new deals done with Tom and Walker during the 2025 season, the team could feasibly roll over $30 million of cap space into next season. That should more than cover the 2026 years on both of those players’ deals, giving the team still more space to work for next season and beyond. Then if the team does elect to rework any of their other high-priced veteran contracts, that allows for further flexibility next spring.', 'The math on the Packers’ side was simple: Alexander’s availability has been a major question mark, and they felt it simply was not worth using up roughly $35 million in salary cap space over two years to keep him on the roster when that money could be put to good use elsewhere.', 'Gambling Problem?

', 'A league source confirmed what was first reported by the NFL Network early Monday morning, as the Packers and Alexander’s camp could never come to an agreement on a restructured contract. ', 'The sides were seeking a new deal that would have reduced Alexander’s 2025 base salary of $16.15 million to protect the team from another injury-plagued year for the shutdown cover man while also giving Alexander the ability to recoup most or all of the pay cut if he stayed healthy this season.', 'Alexander had two years remaining on his blockbuster four-year, $84 million extension, but there was no more built-in guaranteed money in the deal, and the two sides never could come to an accord on the structure of an altered contract.', 'The 28-year-old Alexander had been set to report to the team’s mandatory minicamp — even without a restructured contract in place — in time for Tuesday’s first practice, but the move wasn’t meant only as a show of good faith.', 'Rather, Alexander showing up for minicamp would force the team to make a decision on whether to keep him or release him — or, at the very least, sweeten the restructured deal that was on the table from the club — because of the very real danger that he could suffer a serious injury during the three-day camp and the team would be on the hook for his entire 2025 salary as a result.', 'The move comes even as the Packers’ players and coaches acknowledged that the team’s defense is better when Alexander is part of it — so long as he is healthy enough to be on the field.', 'And that had become increasingly problematic over the past four years, including last year, when he played in just seven games.', 'Head coach Matt LaFleur had been cautious in his remarks about Alexander after confirming that Alexander had taken part in the first week of the team’s offseason program in the virtual realm. He did not attend any of the in-person Phase I or Phase II sessions, though, and he wasn’t at any of the organized team activity practices the past two weeks, either.', 'Several teammates spoke during OTAs of their hope that Alexander would be back this season, but both safety Xavier McKinney and cornerback Keisean Nixon were measured in their comments, saying their friend needed to do what was best for him.', '“I love 2-3 to death. That’s my boy,” Nixon said. “If he comes back and he’s here, we’d love to have him. I love to play with Jaire. That’s just what it is since I’ve been here.', '“Whatever happens, happens. We don’t have control over that. If he’s here, we’re going to rock out. If he’s not, we’re still going to rock out. That’s just how it goes.”', ""Added McKinney: “We would all like him back. I talk to him every day, pretty much, just trying to stay connected with him. Obviously, we've developed a great relationship with each other. But my thing that I always try to talk about is that's his own situation and I want the best for him. So at the end of the day I'm going to be behind him regardless of what the situation is."", ""“We've developed a relationship good enough off the field to where it's like, ‘I just want what's best for you and I'm going to be there regardless.’ I've been vocal about that with him. Like I said, we good friends. We all want him here, but however that situation plays out, that's how it plays out. I just want whatever is best for him.” "", 'Defensive passing-game coordinator Derrick Ansley, who oversees the cornerback group, had been in touch with Alexander every day despite his uncertain status.', ""“Every day. Every day we have contact,” Ansley said last month. “Every morning, I send him a positive quote. Sometimes it's a scripture. Sometimes it's just something that somebody sends me and I forward it to him. But we have contact every morning.”"", 'Nevertheless, Alexander’s status had been in limbo ever since the end of the season, with general manager Brian Gutekunst openly acknowledging the possibility of trading the 2018 first-round pick — Gutekunst’s inaugural draft choice as GM — if the sides could not reach an agreement on a pay cut.', ""“We invested a lot in Jaire and want to make sure — if he's not going to be on our football team helping us win games — that we get something back for that investment,” Gutekunst said at the annual NFL Meetings in Florida in March."", '“Obviously [he is] a very, very good player for us, and we have some time here to figure that out — and see what’s best for him and the organization.”', 'That time for a decision ended up being nearly five months from the team’s season-ending Jan. 12 NFC playoff loss to the eventual Super Bowl LIX-champion Philadelphia Eagles.', 'Along the way, Gutekunst had plenty of conversations with other NFL teams about trading Alexander, although opinions differed on what his value might be.', 'Ultimately, Alexander’s $17.1 million cap number for this season was too large of a stumbling block, as potential trade partners faced the same issue that the Packers did — the risk of paying a player whose availability has been an issue.', 'Of the Packers’ 68 regular-season games since the start of the 2021 season, Alexander played in 34 of them — including his 10-snap stint against the Chicago Bears on Nov. 17 at Soldier Field before pulling himself out of the game when his knee acted up — and missed 34 of them.', 'After earning his first All-Pro nod in 2020, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games and had a pair of interceptions against Tom Brady in the team’s loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC Championship Game that year, Alexander missed 13 games in 2021, when he sustained a right shoulder injury in Week 4 when he went low to tackle Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris.', 'He returned for the team’s NFC divisional playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers, playing eight of Green Bay’s 54 snaps in that defeat.', 'While Alexander returned to health in 2022, missing only one start with a groin injury and regaining his All-Pro form, his 2023 season was disappointing on multiple levels. He missed three games with a back injury and six more with a shoulder injury, then was suspended for a game for conduct detrimental to the team.', 'But he seemed to learn from the suspension, which came after he appointed himself as a captain for the pregame coin flip before a game against the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte, his hometown.', 'Alexander’s first-quarter interception in the NFC wild card playoffs at Dallas helped fuel the Packers’ dominating win over the Cowboys, and after the team overhauled its strength-and-conditioning staff and hired Jeff Hafley to replace deposed defensive coordinator Joe Barry during the offseason, Alexander appeared poised for another bounce-back year in 2024.', 'Instead, after a strong start that included a pick-six — Alexander’s first interception return for a touchdown since high school — in the Packers’ Sept. 22 win at Tennessee for his second INT in the first three games, he missed the next two games with groin and quadriceps injuries.', 'Then came the fateful final defensive play of the team’s Oct. 27 victory at Jacksonville, when Alexander came up hobbling on the Jaguars’ game-tying Trevor Lawrence-to-Evan Engram touchdown pass with 1 minute 48 seconds left in the game. Later, Alexander would reveal that he tore the PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) in his right knee.', 'After missing one game and taking the bye week to heal, he worked out before the game in Chicago but lasted less than two series — and never played again. Some inside Lambeau Field questioned whether Alexander could have played through the injury.', 'Alexander underwent arthroscopic surgery on the knee in December and finished the year on injured reserve.', '“Every time he kind of got to the point where we thought he was going to be able to get over the hump, he wasn’t able to,” Gutekunst said of Alexander’s inability to return to the lineup after the Chicago game. “Give him a lot of credit for trying to get out there and help us. But yeah, it was disappointing.”', 'Alexander initially agreed to speak with a reporter as players cleaned out their lockers on Jan. 13, but when he saw a gaggle of TV cameras approaching, he changed his mind.', '“I don’t even know if I’ll be here next year,” he told the throng.', 'Then, he added, “You don’t want to hear what I’ve got to say. … I don’t have anything good to say.”', 'COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

He might not receive great production out of his new starters, including cornerback Kelee Ringo.', 'Ringo is one of two cornerbacks — the other being veteran Adoree’ Jackson — battling to replace Darius Slay, who was released in March and signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers.', 'The 22-year-old has only started five games during the first two years of his career (2023-2024), not proving much.', 'If Ringo plays poorly in his first year as a starter, the Eagles’ defense could regress, hurting the team’s chances of winning back-to-back Super Bowls.', 'The Eagles could solve that concern by signing former Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander, who was released Monday.', 'Alexander, who has made second-team All-Pro twice, has been of the league’s best cornerbacks since getting drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. But after dealing with injuries in three of the last four years, Alexander’s body could be battered, ruining his ability.', 'Despite having a concerning injury history (19 games missed in the last two years), the 28-year-old will still command significant money, with so many teams needing to add a starting cornerback.', 'Eagles general manager Howie Roseman should at least discuss the idea of signing Alexander even though he comes with a major risk. He would be an upgrade over Ringo and could make Philadelphia’s secondary better than last year’s elite unit.', 'Still, it’s more likely that Philadelphia goes into the season with Ringo starting and with Jackson as the top backup, or vice versa.', 'The Eagles probably won’t spend a substantial amount of money on an oft-injured cornerback, but plenty of NFL teams might be willing to do that. The Minnesota Vikings, Los Angeles Rams, among other organizations, could aggressively pursue Alexander to fix their cornerback issues.', 'Alexander could become the No. 1 CB for those defenses, maintaining his reputation as an elite player, but he might not be considered Philadelphia’s top cornerback since DeJean and Mitchell both demonstrated All-Pro upside last season. If he cares about being in that role still, the Eagles might not be his first choice.', 'He could also experience more health problems this season, a situation the Eagles could get frustrated with. Fangio might also worry that Alexander’s poor tackling — his 38.5 percent missed-tackle rate was the worst for any cornerback in the NFL last season — will make a tough Eagles’ defense less physical and more sloppy.', 'DeJean, the Eagles’ star nickelback, can play a large amount of snaps on the outside and would be able to take over for a struggling Ringo. That option makes Alexander less of a priority.', 'Even though Alexander excels in zone coverage and has great ball skills (12 career interceptions), him being undersized (5-10, 196 pounds) and frequently injured could be too tough for the Eagles to overlook.', 'Alexander could sign with another team quickly, but it probably won’t be Philadelphia for multiple reasons, including the team’s philosophy of playing young draft picks.', 'Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

Alexander has been an undeniable talent for Green Bay, earning two Pro Bowl appearances and a pair of second-team All Pro honors since being drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL draft. However, he has struggled to stay healthy in recent seasons. He played just four games in 2021, seven in 2023, and seven in 2024.', 'Heading into 2025, Alexander was set to make $16.15 million in salary and take up nearly $25 million in cap space. That led many to believe he was either going to be cut or traded this offseason, but no trade ever materialized. The Packers will take on over $17 million in dead cap when they officially release Alexander, but because it’s a post-June 1 release, that cap hit will be spread between this year (~$7.5 million) and next (~$9.5 million).', 'While Green Bay likely knew this was possible all offseason, it still does leave their cornerback room quite vulnerable this offseason. They signed Nate Hobbs to a four-year, $48 million deal this offseason, but his best football has been played at the nickel position. That said, safety Javon Bullard may play nickel now, as the Packers believe Hobbs has the versatility to compete on the outside. Elsewhere to contend for a starting outside cornerback job is veteran Keisean Nixon, 2025 seventh-round pick Micah Robinson and 2023 seventh-round pick Carrington Valentine, among others.', 'Gambling Problem?

Eagles News: Philadelphia named among potential Jaire Alexander landing spots,https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2025/6/9/24446026/eagles-news-philadelphia-potential-jalen-alexander-landing-spots-cornerback-packers-release-nfl,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Philadelphia Eagles news and links for 6/9/25.', 'If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.', 'Let’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles links ...', 'Jaire Alexander’s 6 best NFL landing spots after release by Packers - SB Nation\nPhiladelphia Eagles: Never doubt the allure of playing for the champion. Here’s the thing: Philly does not need a cornerback. Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are both fantastic, and Kelee Ringo showed big-time promise. That said, Ringo only played 113 snaps last season in a rotational role, and it’s highly possible he doesn’t have it to be an every-down outside corner. Alexander would be one hell of an insurance policy in case Ringo isn’t an every-down guy, and could also open some rotation at the position to create different looks. It would be a very Eagles move to land Alexander on a cheap, incentive-laden deal to showcase him for free agency.', 'Report: Packers will release Jaire Alexander - Acme Packing Company\nAlexander’s contract, which ran through 2026, was set to pay him $17.5 million in cash this season and carry a salary cap hit of $24.6 million. By releasing him after June 1st, the Packers will free up over $17 million in cap space for this season, carrying about $7.5 million in dead money in 2025. The team will then absorb $9.5 million in dead money in 2026, which is the remainder of his signing bonus money that is amortized onto the 2026 and 2027 cap years. The main sticking point for the Packers all offseason has been Alexander’s availability, or lack thereof. After signing his most recent contract extension in May of 2022, he was a second-team All-Pro and set a career-high with five interceptions that fall. However, since then he has suited up for just seven regular season games in each of the last two seasons, while also causing some headaches for the Packers off the field.', 'Hold For Now - Iggles Blitz\nThis is another case where the Eagles would like their own young player to win the job. Ringo would give them a cost-friendly solution for a couple of years. He could develop into a good CB. The coaches and front office will keep an eye on CB. The team lost Darius Slay, Isaiah Rodgers and Avonte Maddox. They added Ringo, Jackson and rookie Mac McWilliams. That is a lot of talent and experience walking out the door. That’s life in the modern NFL. You have to take chances on young players and under-the-radar veterans. You can’t pay everyone. If there are struggles at corner, Howie will start working the phones, whether that is for Ramsey or some other player. These OTA practices have limitations, but it at least gives the young players a chance to show something. The coaches can see what kind of shape they’re in. The coaches can see if they make mental mistakes. The coaches can just get a feel for their mindset. What kind of vibes is the player giving off? You want players to be confident, but not overly cocky.', 'Eagles Film Review: Antwaun Powell-Ryland could have a role as a pass-rush specialist - BGN\nOverall, Antwaun Powell-Ryland is a high-motor pass rusher who posted some of the best production in college football over the past two years. He clearly lacks ideal measurables, but he compensates with a diverse number of pass rush moves and outstanding effort. He’s not strong enough or long enough to hold up as an every-down EDGE, and his struggles in the run game will likely limit him to sub-package duty throughout his career. However, he can bring value as a 3rd down pass-rusher.', 'In Roob’s Observations: Making sure an underrated Eagles assistant coach gets his due - NBCSP\n1. Conversations about the best defensive coordinators in Eagles history always mention Marion Campbell, Bud Carson, Jim Johnson and Vic Fangio. And rightfully so. One name that’s often omitted is Jim Schwartz, and that’s a mistake. The job Schwartz did in 2017 was remarkable. That Super Bowl defense was actually better than this past year’s in a lot of categories, including 3rd-down percentage (32 percent in 2017 to 36 percent in 2024), run defense (3.8 to 4.3) and takeaways (31 in 16 games, 26 in 17 games). Both allowed 17 points per game and 17 first downs per game and both averaged 2.4 sacks per game. In one fewer game, the 2017 unit had more interceptions (19 to 13) . The 2017 group held quarterbacks to lower a completion percentage (60.4 to 62.2) and a lower passer rating (79.5 to 82.5). And that 2017 defensive roster wasn’t nearly as talented as the 2024 group, which was jam packed with next-level draft picks. There were a few starts, like Fletcher Cox, Malcolm Jenkins, Rodney McLeod and Brandon Graham. But there were also a bunch of mid-level journeyman-type of starters or backups, like Patrick Robinson, Vinny Curry, Tim Jernigan, Mychal Kendricks, Jalen Mills, Ronald Darby, Corey Graham, Derek Barnett, Chris Long and Beau Allen. Good and in some cases very good players who were perfect for that team and played so well in that system for that team and that coach. Schwartz got the most out of what he had, and that’s the mark of a great coach. Fangio is a wizard. Johnson was a genius. Ol’ Swampy was a fantastic defensive coach under Dick Vermeil. Bud Carson was the perfect guy for that 1991 group. But Schwartz deserves to be mentioned with the others. He was brilliant in 2017.', 'Eagles rookie NFL player comparisons: QB Kyle McCord - PhillyVoice\nThe player McCord reminds me of is Sam Darnold. Like McCord, Darnold enrolled at a major college program and was not the starter to begin each of his first two seasons. He eventually did start in his second season (which was actually his redshirt freshman season), and immediately made an impact, throwing 31 TDs vs. 9 INTs. Darnold’s and McCord’s college stats are very similar. McCord’s are actually a little better.', 'NFC East 2025 Futures Preview: Best bet, key questions and market edges - PFF\nHurts has one of the biggest gaps in EPA when he faces disruption versus not — defined as the defense either generating pressure to disrupt the quarterback from going through his progression or the coverage unit creating perfect coverage. When the situation is good with solid protection and open receivers, Hurts can deliver. As such, the team is more vulnerable to injuries than a typical offense of its caliber, and the unit lacks depth behind the aforementioned stars at those positions. But assuming Philadelphia’s All-Pro-type players can stay healthy, this is one of the highest-floor, lowest-variance offenses in the NFL. Perhaps more questionable is how the Eagles’ defense looks and projects heading into 2025. It was one of the best defenses in the NFL last season — and by far the best by virtually any metric following the team’s bye week (when standout rookie cornerbacks Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell started playing full-time snaps).', 'NFL minicamp 2025: Teams, rookies, veterans we’re watching - ESPN\nHow do the new players on defense fit together? The Eagles lost a host of defensive contributors this offseason, including cornerback Darius Slay Jr., edge rushers Brandon Graham and Josh Sweat, safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson and defensive tackle Milton Williams. Meanwhile, starting linebacker Nakobe Dean is still rehabbing from a torn patellar tendon and “won’t be back for a while,” according to defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. The Eagles will have a mix of up-and-comers such as cornerback Kelee Ringo, safety Sydney Brown and defensive lineman Moro Ojomo, and new additions in corner Adoree’ Jackson, edge rusher Azeez Ojulari and rookies Ty Robinson and Andrew Mukuba competing for those spots. First-round linebacker Jihaad Campbell (shoulder) will eventually be in the mix as well but won’t be on the field until sometime in August, per Fangio.', 'Takeaways: Cam Ward Is Learning to Talk Football, Not Just Play It - SI\nIt was interesting hearing Saquon Barkley say, implicitly at least, that he’d like to go out on his own terms—raising the notion of Barry Sanders’s retirement as an example of what he might do. I’m not wishing him out of the NFL (I love watching him play), but, as we said with Ragnow, it’s great to see guys having the flexibility to make those sorts of decisions.', 'Spadaro: Rookies no longer, Eagles Class of 2024 hungry for more - PE.com\nThey all know what to expect now: The NFL is no longer uncharted waters. The tempo, the intensity, the physicality, the reliance on perfect technique – all of that is understood. So, for the Eagles’ 2024 Rookie Class, the next stage is to take it a step further because, as everyone in the league says, if you aren’t moving forward, you’re getting bypassed at this level. And nobody in this sophomore class with the Eagles intends to fall a step behind. “You just keep working like you know you need to do,” said Cooper DeJean, who enjoyed a terrific first season with the Eagles as a nickel cornerback, capped off with an interception return for a touchdown in Super Bowl LIX. “Take it day by day. Nobody is going to give it to you. They’re coming after you.” That they are.', 'Meet the Philly Teacher Using Eagles, Phillies Stats to Engage Her Math Students - Delco Today\nAmber Kiley, an elementary school teacher at MaST Community Charter School II, places a local twist on her math lessons that really gets her students engaged, writes Ross DiMattei for CBS News Philadelphia. At the Northeast Philadelphia school, she uses her students’ love for the Eagles and Phillies to make learning arithmetic and measurements more fun to learn. This all started with Saquon Barkley’s historic first season with the Eagles. After each Eagles game, Kiley’s class would add up Barkley’s total rushing yards. “When we started doing it, I could see the difference in engagement with when we actually did the curriculum work in the book to when we started tracking his yards. The participation skyrocketed when we would track Saquon’s rushing yards,” Kiley said.', 'How Texans’ C.J. Gardner-Johnson is fueled by ‘disrespect,’ trade ‘wasn’t about money,’ aims for multiple Super Bowls - Click 2 Houston\nGardner-Johnson, due up to $8.5 million this year with $2 million of his $7.75 million deal guaranteed and up to $11.5 million in 2026 with void years from 2027 to 2030, disagreed vehemently with Roseman’s explanation. “It wasn’t about money,” Gardner-Johnson said. “If it was about money, everybody would have been gone. How can I say this the most respectful way? Saquon deserved it. Zack deserved it, but the reasons behind it, the fans don’t deserve that reason. It’s deeper than that. The fans don’t deserve, ‘It’s about the money,’ because if that was the case, my contract was safe.”', 'Dallas Cowboys should consider signing cornerback Jaire Alexander when released - Blogging The Boys\nIf we are getting down to the core of things here, the biggest argument for Jaire Alexander to the Cowboys has to do with what they have going on at the position themselves. Trevon Diggs, DaRon Bland and Kaiir Elam lead the cornerback room, but they each carry some what-if propositions. There is uncertainty around Diggs’ health, Bland’s as well alongside whether or not his play can return to what we saw in 2023, and whether or not the team will be getting the version of Elam who the Buffalo Bills thought they were drafting. If each or at least some of those things hit then things will be totally fine. But what if they don’t? Alexander carries questions himself as noted. He could be an injury concern. He may be a slight annoyance in a particular moment as the Packers found out in Charlotte. But the floor of the cornerback room would raise significantly with him in the picture and therefore the move is one the Cowboys should seriously consider. It isn’t of the you better do this variety, but this is exactly the rainy day that they save their funds for.', 'Gabe Davis update: As Davis visits other teams, are the New York Giants still interested? - Big Blue View\nWe continue to get questions in the Big Blue View inbox regarding free agent wide receiver Gabe Davis, the one-time Buffalo Bills receiver who visited with the Giants in mid-May.

The Pro Bowl cornerback was slated to earn $17.5 million in cash this coming season while carrying a bloated salary cap charge of $24.6 million, per Spotrac. Packers GM Brian Gutekunst is creating $17 million in cap space by releasing Alexander in a post-June move.', ""Once considered a premier cornerback, injuries have derailed Alexander in recent seasons. After a career-best year in 2022, Alexander has suited up for seven regular-season games apiece in 2023 and 2024. Availability is your best ability, and Alexander hasn't consistently been healthy."", ""Alexander should receive significant interest on the market via an incentive-heavy deal. He's a potential bounce-back candidate in 2025. We've identified three ideal landing spots for Alexander in free agency."", 'Alexander was elite throughout the 2022 season. The former Louisville standout recorded a career-high five interceptions en route to his second Pro Bowl appearance and Second-Team All-Pro nod. His defensive coordinator that year was Joe Barry, who is now a defensive assistant coach with the Miami Dolphins.', ""The Dolphins should also be in the market for a veteran cornerback. They're expected to trade Jalen Ramsey before training camp begins. Ramsey's inevitable departure will leave DC Anthony Weaver with Storm Duck, Cam Smith, Artie Burns, and Jason Marshall Jr. as his in-house options at boundary corner. Alexander would immediately step into a starting role."", 'The Atlanta Falcons struggled to defend the pass last season. Defensive-minded head coach Raheem Morris was disappointed with the results. The Falcons finished 22nd against the pass, allowing 224.5 passing yards per contest.', ""Despite that, the Falcons haven't done enough to invest at cornerback this offseason. A.J. Terrell, Dee Alford, and Mike Hughes return as the starters in base defense. Terrell is an outstanding player, but more talent is needed alongside him. Rookies Billy Bowman Jr. and Xavier Watts should positively impact the secondary, but they'll occupy different positions while helping replace Justin Simmons. Furthermore, Falcons assistant head coach Jerry Gray coached Alexander for three seasons (2020-22) in Green Bay."", ""The Las Vegas Raiders initially appeared to be entering a rebuild period this offseason, but that stopped when they hired 73-year-old head coach Pete Carroll. You can't necessarily blame the aging Carroll for being disinterested in a long-term retool. The Raiders immediately went to work on acquiring veterans who could help them compete, starting with quarterback Geno Smith."", ""Cornerback might be the weakest position on the Raiders' roster. If they sign Alexander, they'd ironically reunite him with former Packers bust Eric Stokes. Jakorian Bennett, Darnay Holmes, and third-round rookie Darien Porter are the other notable corners on defense.

Packers are taking calculated risk in releasing cornerback Jaire Alexander,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6413530/2025/06/09/packers-cornerback-jaire-alexander-fallout/,"['NFL', '85', 'GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Green Bay Packers will free up more than $17.1 million in cap space in 2025 by releasing cornerback Jaire Alexander, according to Over the Cap, and have more than $46 million available in cap space. That’s the third-biggest number in the NFL.', 'What they do with the influx of money, if anything, remains to be seen. A more glaring uncertainty is whether the cornerbacks remaining on the roster are good enough. Not good enough to start in the NFL, but good enough to help the Packers win a Super Bowl. After all, that’s what general manager Brian Gutekunst thinks it’s time his team competes for in 2025.', 'Doing so will be harder without Alexander, though it is no guarantee that he would be on the field in recent seasons. That’s a big reason why Gutekunst is releasing the first player he drafted after becoming Packers GM in 2018.', 'Alexander, 28, made the All-Pro second team both before and after a significant shoulder injury that sidelined him 13 games in 2021. His first honor came in 2020, followed by another in 2022 after the Packers made him the highest-paid cornerback in NFL history at the time, with an extension worth $21 million annually, in March of that year.', '', 'However, over the last two seasons, 2023 and 2024, Alexander missed 20 games with four different injuries. The Packers looked to trade him and hopefully recoup something for their investment, but that didn’t pan out. They also offered Alexander a restructured contract, but the sides couldn’t agree on that, either. So while Alexander is the Packers’ best cornerback if healthy, that became too big an “if” for the team to keep him at a price Alexander’s side desired. Could they have retained one of their best players of the last decade, even at full price? Technically, yes.', 'Alexander’s release frees up a boatload of cap space, but the Packers weren’t exactly strapped for cap this year. They ranked 12th in the NFL with about $29 million in cap space available, according to OTC, before the move. Alexander had a $16.15 million base salary, $650,000 per-game roster bonuses and a $700,000 workout bonus. Financially, the move matters more for 2026. It frees up $19.5 million in cap space for next year, according to OTC, and the Packers were about $10 million over the cap in 2026.', 'No matter the financial impact on both this year and next, the Packers will proceed into a season that carries heightened urgency featuring Keisean Nixon, Nate Hobbs and Carrington Valentine as their top three outside cornerbacks. That seems like a comparable risk to keeping Alexander on even a slightly reduced contract.', '“I love 2-3 to death. That’s my boy,” Nixon said last week of Alexander. “If he comes back and he’s here, we’d love to have him. I love to play with Jaire. That’s just what it is since I’ve been here. Jaire pushed me to be really who I am because it’s always friendly competition between me and him.', '“Whatever happens, happens. We don’t have control over that. If he’s here, we’re gonna rock out. If he’s not, we’re still gonna rock out. That’s just how it goes.”', '', 'The Packers will rock out without him in a division with two reigning first-team All-Pro receivers, Minnesota’s Justin Jefferson and Detroit’s Amon-Ra St. Brown. And they’ll also rock out without a premium cornerback in the pipeline, as the Packers didn’t draft one until the seventh round in Tulane’s Micah Robinson.', 'Nixon dubbed himself “CB1” shortly after the season ended, but can he lock down opposing No. 1 wide receivers consistently? Gutekunst seemed to think he’s capable after Nixon’s first season playing primarily on the outside in 2024.', '“I think he played really, really well,” the GM said in February. “I think he really fit what (defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley) was trying to do. First of all, he’s an outstanding competitor. I didn’t blink when we asked him to do that, but I just think his athleticism and his ability … with his eyes and his ability to tackle served us well out there.', '“For me, he may not have the length that some of those guys on the outside have, but his awareness and ball skills make up for that.”', 'Hobbs was more of a nickel with the Las Vegas Raiders, but the Packers inked him to a four-year deal worth $12 million annually in free agency to play both inside and outside. In Green Bay’s base defense during voluntary OTA practices open to the media, it has been Hobbs opposite Nixon on the outside to start.', '“He’s had a lot of success inside, and I thought his tape outside was equally as good,” Hafley said this offseason of Hobbs. “He is competitive, he’s tough, he is physical. He plays the game fast. You can tell he loves it. It just jumps off the tape.”', 'Valentine is technically the most traditional outside corner of the three, and he’s flashed over his first two seasons in the NFL. However, his playing time has been inconsistent. Trotting out that top three at cornerback figures to put more pressure on Green Bay’s pass rush, which was inconsistent last season and didn’t add any clear-cut Day 1 contributors in the offseason.', 'Gutekunst opted instead to trust that the likes of Rashan Gary, Kenny Clark and Lukas Van Ness will be better, which is another calculated gamble for a defense tasked with following up Hafley’s impressive debut season with a worthwhile encore.', 'The Packers have grown accustomed to playing without Alexander over the last two seasons, whether it be from the perspective of their secondary or their pass rush, so doing so again won’t necessarily be new. But even if he wasn’t always at his best when on the field in 2023 and 2024, a healthy Alexander would have given the Packers the best chance in the long run against the slew of receivers they’ll face in 2025.', '', 'In Week 1, St. Brown and the Detroit Lions. In Week 2, Terry McLaurin and the Washington Commanders. In Week 4, CeeDee Lamb and the Dallas Cowboys. In Week 6, Ja’Marr Chase and the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 7, Marvin Harrison Jr. and the Arizona Cardinals. In Week 8, DK Metcalf and the Pittsburgh Steelers. In Week 10, A.J. Brown and the Philadelphia Eagles. In Week 11, Malik Nabers and the New York Giants. Then St. Brown once more and Jefferson twice down the stretch.', 'For two traditional nickels, even if Nixon impressed on the outside last season and the Packers think Hobbs can do the same, that’s a tall task.', 'Hobbs was asked during his introductory news conference about a potential pairing with Nixon, his former Raiders teammate, on the outside.', '“Think it’d be legendary,” he said.', 'The Packers better hope it is, or those Super Bowl dreams will remain just that.', '(Top photo: Dylan Buell / Getty Images)', 'Matt Schneidman is a staff writer for The Athletic covering the Green Bay Packers.

Now he’s a free agent.', 'The Buffalo Bills engaged in trade talks for Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander this offseason, per a report from Jordan Schultz. Multiple NFL reports on Monday indicated the enigmatic CB would be released by Green Bay after contract renegotiations failed.', 'Could the Bills add Alexander now that he doesn’t have a hefty contract anchoring him down? That remains to be seen.', 'Alexander signed a lucrative contract extension in 2022 and had a great season, but in 2023 and 2024 he’s fallen hard on injuries. He played in just seven games in each of those seasons. He also missed a dozen games in 2021, so injuries concerns are very real.', 'Green Bay wanted to adjust his contract to be more incentive-based in order to make sure they paid for performance, not potential. The Bills also asked for a contract change as part of the trade talks.', 'There were also some off-field concerns about Alexander. Here is Acme Packing Company on one of Alexander’s bonehead moments:', 'One of the games Alexander missed in 2023 was because of an incident when the Packers played the Carolina Panthers in his hometown of Charlotte. Alexander nearly messed up the coin toss before that game despite not being designated as a team captain, and the Packers suspended him for the following contest. Although the player and team said publicly that the suspension did not impact their long-term relationship, it was the first sign of significant cracks between the two sides.', 'The Bills engaged in trade talks for Jaire Alexander earlier in the 2025 offseason. Since then, they have completely revamped their cornerback position. They extended Christian Benford, an up-and-coming star in the league and their long-term stalwart plan.', 'Then Buffalo shored up their veteran depth opposite Benford with Dane Jackson, a former Bills CB starter with experience, and former first-round pick and All-Pro Tre’Davious White. White’s a few years and a couple serious injuries removed from him All-Pro years, but then again so is Alexander.', 'After those moves, the Bills drafted CB Maxwell Hairston in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft and later added Dorian Strong to the same draft class.', 'I’d be remiss if I didn’t include the other move they made at cornerback, giving up on former first-round pick Kaiir Elam by sending him to the Dallas Cowboys for a late-round pick.', 'The Bills added short-term and long-term options at CB, so they don’t really have a need at the position.', 'The Bills have a reported $2 million in Top-51 cap space, per Spotrac, so adding the final two players to the roster at cutdown time would have them up against the cap. The Bills have some levers they could pull to open significant cap space this offseason (and they likely will during training camp to provide them with flexibility for the season).', 'Because Alexander only played seven games last year, the Bills and almost every other team are going to look to add him on an incentive-laden deal. Alexander thinks he can get more money than what the Packers were offering, but there are structures on a one-year deal where the Bills could make the incentives easy to hit and have them apply to the 2026 cap.', 'The Not Likely To Be Earned Incentives threshold wouldn’t be high for Alexander: Play in eight games, make three interceptions, make 20 tackles... Not difficult bars to break.', 'Buffalo is far from settled at the cornerback position. They have a lot of options, but not necessarily a lot of solutions. Tre’Davious White has looked good in OTAs, but is half a decade removed from his last All-Pro, has had two major leg injuries, and is on his third team in 12 months because of it. Dane Jackson was cut by the Panthers this offseason. Maxwell Hairston and Dorian Strong are far from certainties.', 'Alexander was an All-Pro in 2022 and still has that talent. Buffalo has already taken a similar approach signing oft-injured pass rusher Joey Bosa this offseason. If the Bills signed Alexander, there is a scenario where it works out in spades.', 'With their salary cap situation being what it is and the roster moves they have made, I think the totality of it is going to push Alexander elsewhere.

(via @RapSheet) pic.twitter.com/t7pWrBQ3Ur', 'Alexander is a two-time Pro Bowl cornerback and former first-round pick who has spent all seven of his seasons in Green Bay and has ample playoff experience.', 'The Eagles are known for frequently kicking tires on – or at least exploring – accomplished veterans when they become available, either via trade market or free agency. Given the importance of the cornerback position, interest around the league in Alexander will probably be widespread.', ""Typically, when one of the league's top players suddenly becomes available in June, there are reasons for other teams to be as skeptical as they are intrigued. Here is the case for and against the Eagles signing the soon-to-be free agent: "", ""He's a no-doubt starter"", 'With Slay off to the Steelers, the Eagles are currently competing free-agent veteran Adoree’ Jackson against third-year pro Kelee Ringo to start opposite second-year star Quinyon Mitchell while also trying to maintain the standard they set last year as the NFL’s top-ranked defense. The competition would immediately cease if Alexander came aboard. Alexander is better and more accomplished than either of the aforementioned two. Alexander has played both cornerback spots in his career and even nickelback. Per PFF, he has played 53 percent of his career snaps at left corner, 37 percent at right corner, and 10 percent in the slot. Since the start of 2022, Alexander has primarily played the right side, which is interesting because the Eagles have asked Mitchell this spring to practice at left corner despite manning the right side as a rookie. ', ""He's a playmaker"", ""Alexander was the 18th overall pick of the Packers in the 2018 draft out of Louisville and clocked 4.3 speed. His talent and athleticism have translated, as Alexander has made two Pro Bowls and was twice named second-team All-Pro. He has 12 career interceptions, including five in 2022, and three postseason interceptions in seven games. Alexander has three times as many career INTs than Adoree' Jackson, who has played 19 more games than Alexander. In eight playoff games, Jackson has produced no turnovers. Kelee Ringo has played just 311 total snaps over two years and has one interception in his rookie season. Alexander’s playmaking ability makes him far more comparable to Slay, who has 28 career INTs, nine of which came with the Eagles. "", 'He’s still young', ""Though he's played seven seasons, Alexander entered the NFL at 21 years old and is only 28. Slay was 29 when the Eagles traded for him and played five seasons with them, helping the team get to two Super Bowls and win one. Alexander has struggled with injuries – more on that later – but doesn’t turn 29 until the day after the Super Bowl. If the Eagles could sign him to a short-term deal, they could still get at least two full under-30 seasons from Alexander to evaluate him for the longer term or buy time to find an option beyond 2026."", '', '', 'Is he hungry for a ring?', 'With the Packers, Alexander played in seven postseason games, including consecutive NFC Championship Game losses (to the 49ers and Bucs). He’ll likely command interest from several teams, but … could he view the Eagles as his best opportunity to win that elusive ring? He’s dealt with injuries throughout his career and could see a closing window. Also, his versatility and ability to play in both man and zone coverages make him an ideal fit for Vic Fangio’s scheme and could position him for success that could lead to another, bigger contract.', 'The Eagles aren’t spending big money', ""Alexander reportedly was offered a restructure (i.e. paycut) but wouldn’t accept it, per the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, which could be an indication that his agent believes the market will be strong in free agency. It’s not often that a cornerback of Alexander’s resume hits the open market in June, and teams that missed out on their top free-agent corners in March now get a second chance. The Eagles have been shedding salary this offseason and limiting their big spending, so it’s fair to question if they’d get involved if a bidding war for Alexander ensues."", 'He has major durability concerns', 'The list of his missed games from injuries is long and varied: back, shoulder, quad, knee. He only played 14 total games over the past two seasons and played just four in 2021, which means he’s played just 34 of a possible 68 regular-season games over the past four seasons. He only missed one playoff game – the Packers’ 22-10 wild-card loss to the Eagles in January – because he had undergone knee surgery that sidelined him for the final seven games of the season. You can get past the injury element if Alexander is on a one-year deal, but if he’s going to command bigger bucks and more years, his injury history has to be taken into account. ', 'Why are the Packers moving on from him?', ""Alexander’s relationship with the Packers over the past few years has been tenuous. He was suspended for one game in 2023 for conduct detrimental to the team after he named himself a team captain before a game against the Panthers and went out for the coin toss. At the time, coach Matt LaFleur said there were other reasons for the suspension. LaFleur was evasive in January when asked if Alexander viewed his knee injury differently than team doctors did. “I can't really get into all that,” LaFleur said, per this ESPN.com story. The Packers finished 2024 with the fifth-best overall defense despite missing Alexander most of the season, so that’s probably the primary reason they’re moving on from him. Nobody's saying Alexander is a bad guy, but Pro Bowl corners don’t grow on trees, so you have to wonder if there’s more to this story. "", 'The Eagles need to find out about Ringo', ""The Eagles have done well lately with their draft-and-develop approach, especially with their haul of picks from Georgia, which is the school Ringo attended. Year 3 is where guys like Josh Sweat, Milton Williams, T.J. Edwards, Cam Jurgens and Reed Blankenship have started to emerge in their careers, and when the Eagles like their draft picks to see the field by so they can make a long-term judgment on them. Signing Alexander would take that chance away from Ringo, who’d be a backup and special-teamer after being picked in the fourth round of the 2023 draft. It's not the best reason to avoid signing Alexander, but the Eagles already have emerging stars in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. If they believe Ringo is on the trajectory to just be a solid corner, that should be good enough – and far less expensive – for them to still be a championship-caliber defense."", ""SIGN UP HERE to receive PhillyVoice's Sports newsletters"", 'Follow Geoff on Twitter/X: @geoffpmosher', 'Like us on Facebook: PhillyVoice Sports', 'GEOFF MOSHER\nPhillyVoice Staff', 'mosher@phillyvoice.com', 'This is a modal window.', '', '', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'SPONSORED', 'PARENTING', 'ARTS & CULTURE', 'BOOKS', 'PHILLIES', 'ADULT HEALTH', 'TRAVEL', 'ENTERTAINMENT', ""PENN'S LANDING"", 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'TRAVEL', 'SUMMER', 'PARENTING', 'PHILANTHROPY', '© 2025 WWB Holdings, LLC.

"With Jaire Alexander now on the market, time is ticking for the Dolphins’ corners",https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article308209170.html,"['', 'The Miami Dolphins cornerbacks’ time to prove themselves is slowly ticking away.', 'On Monday, the Green Bay Packers released two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jaire Alexander, instantly improving the free agent market that includes Rasul Douglas, Stephon Gilmore and Asante Samuel Jr. And with mandatory minicamp to start Tuesday, the current crop of Dolphins outside corners could have just three days to get it together before reinforcements are brought in.', '“I’ve said to the group a couple times, ‘I have a depth chart to fill out, can you help me out with it?’” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said May 28. “But realistically, we’re far from establishing what that is at any position. Yes, there’s guys that are not going to get beaten out, but the biggest thing is I want people to show me who they are. I don’t like looking at a guy, looking at their name plate and judging them off of last year, the year before. I want to see how they compete and what they do with the opportunity.”', 'The Dolphins’ cornerback situation has been muddied ever since Jalen Ramsey and the team mutually agreed to part ways in April. That left several practice squad players (Isaiah Johnson, Ryan Cooper Jr.), a 2023 second-round pick (Cam Smith), a rookie (Jason Marshall Jr.), a handful of undrafted guys (Ethan Bonner, Storm Duck, BJ Adams, Ethan Robinson and Kader Kohou) and few aged veterans (Artie Burns and Kendall Sheffield), all of whom, outside of Kohou, a nickel corner, haven’t been consistent starters in their careers or in quite some time. And although Dolphins general manager Chris Grier has unsuccessfully tried to find a trade partner for Ramsey, who will not participate in minicamp, he did pledge to sign another outside corner.', '“We’ve had a number of conversations with players – veteran free agents that are good football players,” Grier said April 26 after the NFL Draft. “We’ve had a number of conversations. Those will continue and we’ll see if we can get something done.”', 'A new cornerback has become even more of a necessity considering how the position fared in organized training activities. Despite consensus No. 1 receiver Tyreek Hill solely running routes uncovered as his surgically repaired wrist recovers, wideouts made quick work of corners in 7-on-7 or 11-on-11 drills. Receiver Jaylen Waddle particularly shined during the scrimmage portion of practice, though he played it off in front of the media.', '“They look extremely good,” Waddle said of the corners June 3. “I’m not going to lie to y’all, they are making it really tough on the receivers. They are playing true to their technique. I think they are doing a good job of taking what they do in individual to when we go into team.”', 'The only question then becomes price. Alexander’s most recent deal paid him an average salary of $21 million per year. Grier, on the other hand, has only given modest contracts this late in the offseason, the most recent examples being defensive tackle Calais Campbell (one-year, $2 million) and edge rusher Emmanuel Ogbah (one-year, $3.25 million) ahead of the 2024 season.', 'Then comes the question of availability. Despite his Pro Bowl status, Alexander’s injury history during the past four seasons should concern the Dolphins. In 2021, he played only four games with a shoulder injury and while he returned in 2022 to earn a Pro Bowl, he has only started a combined 14 games during the past two seasons. That’s not a good sign for the Dolphins, a team that lacks depth at the outside corner spot.', 'Still, Alexander has snagged 12 interceptions and forced three fumbles during his seven-year career.

Jaire Alexander’s 6 best NFL landing spots after release by Packers,https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2025/6/9/24445901/jaire-alexander-packers-release-lions-vikings-jets-rams-eagles-raiders,"['FILED UNDER:', 'These six teams should pick up the phone ASAP.', 'It’s a very weird time in the NFL calendar, and it just got a whole lot more bizarre with the news that the Green Bay Packers are releasing All-Pro cornerback Jaire Alexander. While the two sides have been butting heads in recent months, it’s stunning the team couldn’t find a trade partner — even to get some modest return.', 'Alexander was set to have a salary cap hit of $24.6M this season as part of the contract extension he signed in 2022, but considering this was a post-June 1 release he will now only count as $7.5M, freeing up roughly $17M in cap space. This could allow Green Bay to make a play for a replacement (Jalen Ramsey?), or simply prepare for 2026 with a boatload of cash.', 'The sticking point between Alexander and the Packers has been a series of annoying injuries which has kept him sidelined for the majority of the last two years. The cornerback was named to the second All-Pro team in 2020 and 2022, but has only suited up for 14 games over the last two years. Sidelined with back, shoulder, quadricep, and knee injuries — it’s been a seemingly endless string for missed games for Alexander who butted heads with team officials in 2023 when he interjected himself in the coin toss for a contest with the Carolina Panthers, leading to him being suspended by the team.', 'Alexander and the Packers had reportedly been trying to re-work his contract to remove some of the guaranteed money in the deal, and convert salary to incentive-based clauses in an effort to account for his injuries. That didn’t come to pass, and now Alexander is looking for a new team.', 'In spite of the injuries, it shouldn’t be a long wait. Cornerbacks the caliber of Jaire Alexander don’t come along very often, especially as free agents before training camp — and that could lead to these teams making a call to his agent.', 'Do the Lions explicitly need a cornerback? Not really, but when you’re a contender with the amount of cap space the Lions have they should be in on everyone.', 'Detroit are in a really nice position where they could sign Alexander to a high-incentive deal that would give them a ludicrous DB room with Terrion Arnold, D.J. Reed, and Jaire Alexander — plus is would be a serious middle finger to the Packers by inking one of their best defensive players.', 'Even if you assume Alexander might only give you 7-to-10 games this season it’s worth throwing a dart and seeing if it sticks.', 'Let’s stick in the NFC North and throw another team in who are in dire need of help at cornerback. The Vikings stunningly decided not to address the position in the 2025 NFL Draft, and have massive problems at the position considering how pass-happy to division is.', 'There’s been some speculation that the Vikings could be in on a Jalen Ramsey trade if it emerged, but as that drags out a more realistic scenario for them might be ponying up the money for Alexander and giving him a short relocation.', 'This is a dire need for Minnesota this season. A lack of consistent playing time could be a sticking point, but the Vikings CB room is so lacking this might be a move that needs to happen.', 'Brandon Stephens as a starting cornerback just ain’t it. There’s very much the feeling that this team is solely looking for a warm body to put across from Sauce Gardner and hope that’s enough, but this shouldn’t prevent the Jets from looking for a big time upgrade considering the cap space they have.', 'I like this fit because I think Aaron Glenn could get a lot out of Alexander. He’s the exact kind of motivating players’ coach who can inspire Alexander and get him back to playing his best football. Obviously you can’t control injuries, but in every other aspect this could be a good get, and fill a major need.', 'Never doubt the allure of playing for the champion. Here’s the thing: Philly does not need a cornerback. Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are both fantastic, and Kelee Ringo showed big-time promise. That said, Ringo only played 113 snaps last season in a rotational role, and it’s highly possible he doesn’t have it to be an every-down outside corner.', 'Alexander would be one hell of an insurance policy in case Ringo isn’t an every-down guy, and could also open some rotation at the position to create different looks. It would be a very Eagles move to land Alexander on a cheap, incentive-laden deal to showcase him for free agency.', 'Can you name the starting cornerbacks for the Raiders? Can you name one starting cornerback for the Raiders? If you managed to say Jakorian Bennett and Eric Stokes then you win. Your prize is two terrible cornerbacks.', 'Neither Bennett nor Stokes are starting-caliber talents in the NFL. On most teams they’d be 3rd and 4th options at best. There’s a dire need to get better in a hurry and start off the Pete Carroll era on the right foot, which means looking for every upgrade possible at every position imaginable.', 'There’s part of me that still fully expects the Rams to fill their need at CB by ending up with Jalen Ramsey, either via trade or waiting for the Dolphins to release him — but Alexander would be a totally serviceable backup plan if that doesn’t emerge.', 'Getting an upgrade at corner has been an obvious need for Los Angeles all offseason, and at this moment they’re still set to enter the season with Darious Williams and Ahkello Witherspoon on the outside, and that’s ugly.', 'Familiarity still makes Ramsey the most obvious answer here, but if the Dolphins are playing hardball or this drags out too long then Alexander would be a good option.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

The two sides had been exploring trade options throughout the offseason, but nothing came to fruition and ultimately the Packers decided to move on.', ""Alexander, the Packers' first-round pick (18th overall) in 2018, is a two-time Pro Bowler and two-time second-team All-Pro who collected 287 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, 12 interceptions, three forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries during his seven years in Green Bay. "", ""When healthy, he has been one of the best cornerbacks in football, but has increasingly been unable to remain on the field in recent years. Since 2021, Alexander has played in just 34 of 68 possible games. He's played more than seven games in a season just once during that span, though he did make the Pro Bowl and the All-Pro second team during that 2022 campaign."", ""Alexander was due a $16.15 million base salary in 2025, which was the second-to-last year of his four-year, $80 million contract extension. He would have counted against Green Bay's books for $24.6 million, thanks to his prorated signing bonus, but with his post-June 1 release, will instead carry a $7.5 million cap charge this year, saving Green Bay just over $17.1 million."", 'Of course, Alexander is still just 28 years old and he should have plenty of career left ahead of him. With that in mind, we wanted to identify some possible landing spots that might make sense for the oft-injured star corner.', ""The Dolphins are trying to find a home for their own unhappy cornerback in Jalen Ramsey at the moment, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be interested in Alexander now that he's available. The secondary is already an issue for Miami's defense, and it will be even more of one if the Dolphins are able to come to an agreement on a Ramsey deal. Alexander would immediately become the top cornerback on their roster. "", ""The Niners lost Charvarius Ward in free agency this offseason, and currently seem likely to start either journeyman Tre Brown or third-round pick Upton Stout opposite Deommodore Lenoir at one of their corner spots. Bringing in another veteran -- even one with injury issues -- is an idea that has some merit, especially considering how much cap room the 49ers have on their hands. According to Over the Cap, only the Patriots have more cap space than the Niners' current $46.6 million in room."", ""Philly is always aggressive in going after high-level talent, and Alexander fits the bill. He does even more so because the Eagles allowed both Darius Slay and Isaiah Rodgers to leave for greener pastures in free agency this offseason, leaving them with Kelee Ringo or Adoree' Jackson as their other starting corner across from 2024 first-rounder Quinyon Mitchell. Adding Alexander to the mix would allow them to better replicate what they had last year with Mitchell, Slay and slot corner Cooper DeJean. "", 'The Rams, like the Eagles, are always interested in going after star players. Their cornerback situation is a bit more settled with Darious Williams and Ahkello Witherspoon on the outside and Quentin Lake in the slot, but both Williams and Witherspoon have experience bumping inside and adding Alexander to the mix would raise the talent level of the entire group. ', ""Call me a broken record here, but we know the Ravens have a history of going after star contributors -- especially if they don't count against the compensatory pick formula, which Alexander wouldn't because he was released after June 1. Baltimore signed Chidobe Awuzie earlier this offseason to play opposite 2024 first-rounder Nate Wiggins, but Alexander is the more talented player. Especially after the Ravens lost safety Ar'Darius Washington, which will affect their versatility on the back end, it would not be surprising if they were interested in adding another high-level defensive back. They're always looking for ways to keep their options open with how they deploy their personnel."", 'Minnesota defensive coordinator Brian Flores loves to get creative with his pressures up front, and to do that, you need extremely reliable defensive backs. The Vikings have been getting by with their versatile crew over the last two years, but Alexander would be an immediate upgrade on almost anybody in the secondary. Pairing him with Byron Murphy, Harrison Smith, Josh Metellus and more would make for a really interesting back end of the defense.', ""Dallas has a lot of potential answers in the secondary aside from Daron Bland, but none of them is a guarantee and a bunch of them are injured. Trevon Diggs is working his way back from his second major injury. Third-round pick Shavon Revel is recovering from an ACL tear. Trade acquisition Kaiir Elam hasn't lived up to his first-round draft billing. Alexander is obviously another potential injury risk, but at his best he would be by far Dallas' best option."", ""Who wouldn't want to watch Alexander play across from A.J. Terrell? That would be incredibly fun. The Falcons only have around $5 million in cap space, so they would have to move a bunch of money around to make something like this work, but on the field, it makes sense given that Atlanta current has Mike Hughes, fourth-round pick Bill Bowman Jr. and Mike Ford as its perimeter options outside of Terrell."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Injuries put a sizable dent in the 28-year-old's career as of late, appearing in just 14 regular-season games over the previous two years. In 2024, Alexander dealt with multiple injuries, including a knee injury that shut him down for the second half of the year.

Given the financial commitment Green Bay has made to Hobbs, he'll certainly work as one of the starting corners on the boundary. Meanwhile, 2024 second-round pick Javon Bullard will need to put a stamp on it throughout training camp, but should have the inside track at securing the nickel position. Had the Packers kept Alexander, there was a world where Hobbs worked as Green Bay's nickel corner (a role he played with the Raiders), but it now makes more sense for him to work on the outside. "", ""So that leaves the other starting spot on the boundary up for grabs. Nixon and Valentine are the top in-house options. Nixon, who signed a three-year, $18 million extension last offseason, started 15 games for the Packers last season. According to Pro Football Reference's metrics, Nixon allowed a 57.5% completion percentage when targeted last season and a 78.9 passer rating. As for Valentine, a 2023 seventh-round pick, he started seven of his 15 games played during his sophomore campaign and allowed opposing quarterbacks to complete 76.7% of their targets against them and an 80.1 passer rating. "", ""The Packers' remodeling of the safety room last offseason worked wonders in 2024. The group was among the best in the NFL and should help the secondary as they enter this post-Alexander era. The crown jewel of that makeover was Xavier McKinney, who signed a four-year, $67 million deal last spring. He provided immediate dividends, putting together a first-team All-Pro season last year where he broke out 11 passes, posted eight interceptions and 88 tackles. In coverage, McKinney held opposing quarterbacks to a 78.5 passer rating when targeted. "", 'With Bullard positioned to work as the nickel, second-year safety Evan Williams could see a boost in playing time opposite McKinney. In 13 games played last year, the 2024 fourth-rounder registered 49 tackles, three pass breakups and an interception. ', 'Headlined by McKinney, the Packers safety room has top-line talent that should help make life easier for the overall secondary as they sort out the cornerback position. ', 'According to Over the Cap, the Packers currently have about $29 million in available cap space, so they do possess the financial flexibility to add to this group if they want to. ', 'One free agent possibility that could make sense is veteran Stephon Gilmore, who remains on the open market. The former NFL Defensive Player of the Year is entering his age-35 season, but is still a capable complementary piece to a cornerback room. For the Minnesota Vikings last season, he did give up a career-high 94.1 passer rating, but did hold opposing quarterbacks to a 61.9 completion percentage and broke up nine passes through 15 games. ', 'At the very least, Gilmore is someone who could come in and be a high-end depth piece who has plenty of starting experience playing in high-leverage situations, which the Packers hope to find themselves in during the 2025 season.  ', 'Meanwhile, a familiar option could be a reunion with Rasul Douglas, who is also still a free agent. Douglas signed with the Packers in early October during the 2021 season and was with the organization up until the trade deadline in 2023, when he was shipped to the Buffalo Bills. ', ""While Douglas doesn't have familiarity with current defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, he is a known commodity to head coach Matt LaFleur. Douglas started 28 games for the Packers during his tenure, totaling 174 tackles, 32 pass breakups and 10 interceptions. In 15 games played for the Bills last season, Douglas broke up five passes and posted 58 tackles. The 30-year-old did struggle, however, giving up a 122.0 passer rating when covered, according to Pro Football Reference. "", ""If the Packers were looking to make a bigger splash to help replace Alexander, they could call up the Miami Dolphins to see if they can acquire Jalen Ramsey. The star corner is still searching for a trade partner and is currently missing mandatory minicamp as the two sides work toward his departure. From a sheer football standpoint, Ramsey would be the biggest upgrade that is known to be available to the Packers at the moment. In 17 games last season, Ramsey had 11 pass breakups, two interceptions and gave up an 83.2 passer rating when targeted, along with a 62.0 completion percentage. Of course, the Packers would need to be comfortable taking on Ramsey's salary after the Dolphins inked him to a $72.3 million extension last September and currently carries a $16.6 million cap hit for the 2025 season.

The Packers didn’t have much of a choice to part ways with Alexander.', 'A playoff team is going to roll the dice and buy low on him, given Alexander’s skill set.

Cap space isn’t an issue. Signing Alexander would allow Deommodore Lenoir to stay at nickel and take pressure off second-year corner Renardo Green, all while not having to force rookie Upton Stout or one of the free agent signings, like Tre Brown, into the lineup.', 'The issue with that is Alexander being in and out of the lineup, which can hinder the development of the young players if he can’t stay on the field.', 'Alexander’s 2024 sums up who he has been in recent seasons. He had two pass breakups and picked off Jalen Hurts while defending A.J. Brown in Week 1.

Dallas Cowboys should consider signing cornerback Jaire Alexander when released,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2025/6/9/24445951/dallas-cowboys-consider-free-agent-cornerback-jaire-alexander-trevon-diggs-daron-bland,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Jaire Alexander is a name the Cowboys should absolutely consider exploring.', 'The Green Bay Packers invoked hope in the minds of football fans everywhere on Monday morning when their plan to release cornerback Jaire Alexander became known.', 'What one team deems to be unfit for their operation can suddenly be a lifeline for another. As fans of the Dallas Cowboys we have seen this bear itself out a lot over this offseason specifically as the team has been rather active (for their standards) in free agency, but particularly with regards to trades as well. This offseason alone the Cowboys have made phone calls to land four veterans: Kaiir Elam, Kenneth Murray, Joe Milton and George Pickens.', 'No trade will be required to land Alexander now as he will be released, but they obviously are moving on for a reason. Whatever that reason is may not serve to be as much of a deterrent for Dallas as it was Green Bay. There is no question that Alexander can help this team and that he plays a position of need.', 'That sounds like the perfect combination.', 'Let’s set the record straight right away. Alexander has faced some injuries over the last few years and they have inhibited how much time he has played. He played in seven games in both 2023 and 2024 for a total 14, two fewer than the 16 that he suited up for in 2023.', 'It should also be noted in this discussion that Alexander was suspended for a game in 2023 by the Packers for what they deemed to be conduct detrimental to the team. Getting more clear here the “conduct” was that Alexander was not named a team captain prior to Green Bay visiting the Carolina Panthers (he is from North Carolina) in December of that year. Alexander, once again not a captain for the game, went out to midfield for the coin toss and called it (tails never fails!) himself. It was bold and led to a suspension.', 'There is clearly good associated with Alexander, though. He was an All-Pro in both 2020 and 2022 and was still playing in solid form last season in the limited action that he did play. Consider that as December began he had the third-highest ball hawk rate (23.3%) among outside cornerbacks with at least 20 targets to that point in the season, according to NFL Pro.', 'As December wrapped there was no question that the Packers were much better with Alexander than without (which also calls into question his release). When the new year hit the team had a 9.7% lower completion percentage with him on the field as opposed to with him off of it. He made a sizable difference.', 'If we are getting down to the core of things here, the biggest argument for Jaire Alexander to the Cowboys has to do with what they have going on at the position themselves. Trevon Diggs, DaRon Bland and Kaiir Elam lead the cornerback room, but they each carry some what-if propositions. There is uncertainty around Diggs’ health, Bland’s as well alongside whether or not his play can return to what we saw in 2023, and whether or not the team will be getting the version of Elam who the Buffalo Bills thought they were drafting. If each or at least some of those things hit then things will be totally fine. But what if they don’t?', 'Alexander carries questions himself as noted. He could be an injury concern. He may be a slight annoyance in a particular moment as the Packers found out in Charlotte.', 'But the floor of the cornerback room would raise significantly with him in the picture and therefore the move is one the Cowboys should seriously consider. It isn’t of the you better do this variety, but this is exactly the rainy day that they save their funds for.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

He had two years remaining on a contract worth $21 million annually.', 'The 28-year-old enjoyed his best statistical season in 2022, recording five interceptions and 14 passes defended over 16 games. Last season, Alexander played in just seven games, recording two interceptions and one touchdown.', 'NFL Network first reported the news.', 'After almost five months in limbo this offseason, the Packers are releasing general manager Brian Gutekunst’s first draft pick.', 'Alexander signed a then-record extension for cornerbacks in March 2022 for $21 million annually and proceeded to make the All-Pro Second Team the next season, his second such honor in three seasons. However, the 28-year-old played in only 16 of a potential 37 games, including playoffs, over the last two seasons because of four different injuries and a one-game, team-issued suspension in 2023.', 'Alexander had the third-highest cap hit on the team for 2025 behind quarterback Jordan Love and defensive end Rashan Gary. The Packers explored a trade for Alexander since Gutekunst wanted something in return for such a financial investment, but a deal never materialized. The Packers also offered Alexander a restructured contract, but the two sides couldn’t agree on a deal before his release, which frees up more than $17 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap.', 'Now, the Packers enter a season with Super Bowl aspirations featuring Keisean Nixon, Nate Hobbs and Carrington Valentine as their top three outside cornerbacks. Nixon drew rave reviews from Gutekunst after his first season as primarily an outside corner in 2024, while Hobbs signed with the Packers in free agency to play both inside and outside after mostly playing nickel for the Raiders. Valentine, a 2023 seventh-round pick, has flashed in inconsistent playing time over the last two seasons.

""His contributions to our organization were felt on the field, in the locker room and in our community, and he will be missed. We appreciate all he gave and we wish him all the best moving forward.""', ""Earlier this offseason, it seemed a fait accompli that the Packers would move on, whether through a trade or release. After no trade partner materialized during the 2025 NFL Draft, the sides sought a resolution. The Packers reportedly offered a pay reduction for the former first-round pick to remain in Green Bay. Ultimately, Alexander declined the restructured deal. Now, he'll be a free agent."", ""The timing of the release coincides with the Packers' opening of mandatory minicamp on Tuesday."", ""Talent isn't the concern with the 28-year-old corner. When healthy, the 2018 first-round pick is one of the stickiest cover men in the NFL. That ability led to the Packers inking Alexander to a four-year, $84 million contract in 2022. The issue is health."", ""Over the past two years, Alexander has played in just 14 total regular-season games due to a litany of injuries, including to his groin, back, shoulder and knee. He missed the Packers' final eight games of 2024, including their Wild Card Round loss to the Eagles."", 'Packers president Mark Murphy told Dave Schroeder of WBAY on Monday that moving on from Alexander ultimately came down to availability.', '""Well, first of all, he\'s been a great player for us,"" Murphy said. ""Obviously, elite talent and you know unfortunately just injured a lot. It\'s kind of unfortunate that\'s a big part of the game.""', 'Given his skills, Alexander is sure to find another club willing to give him a shot. However, given the recent injury history, it likely will be well south of the $16.15 million in base salary he was set to earn from Green Bay this season.', 'The Packers anticipated the 2025 season sans Alexander, so the move does little to change the on-field situation. The Packers will move forward with Keisean Nixon, free-agent addition Nate Hobbs, Carrington Valentine, Kalen King and seventh-rounder Micah Robinson atop their cornerback depth chart.', ""Murphy said the team is confident in its ability to fill the hole created by Alexander's release, as they've had to play many games without their CB1 over the past two seasons."", '""I feel pretty good,"" Murphy said of the team absorbing Alexander\'s departure. ""I think Keisean Nixon, what a great story undrafted and an All-Pro returner. The reality is for the last four years for Jaire, it\'s about half of the games that he\'s been able to play.

Is this released cornerback a better option for Rams than Jalen Ramsey,https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2025/6/9/24445908/jaire-alexander-released-rams-cornerback-depth-chart,"['FILED UNDER:', 'With Jalen Ramsey trade talks quiet, could Jaire Alexander be the better move for the Rams?', 'Heading into the 2025 season, the Los Angeles Rams are still in need of a cornerback to add to the defense. There has been speculation that the Rams could pursue a trade for Jalen Ramsey. However, discussions have seemed to quiet down recently. Additionally, when asked about the Rams cornerback group, head coach Sean McVay said a few weeks ago, “I feel good about where we’re at.”', 'That could mean one of several things. It’s possible that McVay is publicly downplaying the need for a cornerback in order to help with negotiations. Conversely, trade talks for Ramsey could have also died and the Rams head coach is going to support the players on the roster. Lastly, he could actually feel good about who the Rams have at the cornerback position. Any of those scenarios are possible.', 'In the case that trade talks for Ramsey with the Dolphins have quieted down, the Rams will need to shift their focus. It won’t be long before the Dolphins are forced to show their hand as recent reports suggest that Jalen Ramsey will unsurprisingly not attend mandatory mini-camp. At the end of the day, the Dolphins don’t have leverage in negotiations.', 'One thing that the Rams front office tends to do very well is not force anything and keep their options open. It’s how they’ve approached the draft in recent years and it is likely how they have approached the Ramsey trade negotiations.', 'That approach has worked for the Rams in the past and that’s no different in their search for a top-level cornerback. On Monday morning, the Green Bay Packers released cornerback Jaire Alexander who will now become a free agent.', ""The Packers offered Jaire Alexander a reduced, incentive-laden one-year deal that'd make him a free agent in 2026—Alexander turned it down, not liking the structure. Green Bay tried to trade him in March, and during the draft.\n\nThat also failed, so Alexander's a June free agent."", 'With Alexander now available, it might make more sense for the Rams to shift their focus to the 28-year-old cornerback than try to force a deal for Ramsey. Two major benefits of signing Alexander over trading for Ramsey would be that the Rams would have more control over contract structure and most importantly wouldn’t have to give up draft capital.', 'While the Rams wouldn’t have to give up a first round pick to acquire Ramsey, giving up a third-round pick and receiving a late-rounder in return seems like a realistic package. It’s worth remembering that the Rams already gave up a 2026 fourth round pick to move up for defensive lineman Ty Hamilton in the 2025 NFL Draft.', 'Ramsey may not cost a lot in 2025 as the Rams would only be responsible for around $5.9 million. However, after 2025 is when Ramsey’s contract gets complicated. He does have an out after 2025 with an $18.5 million dead cap penalty. That’s notable as Ramsey’s cap hit is $25 million in 2026, $26.8 million in 2027, and $36.2 million in 2028 with three more void years.', 'It’s possible that the Rams and Ramsey could re-do that contract to make it fit the Rams’ timeline. Still, there’s no guarantee that Ramsey would agree to a restructure or new deal. Meanwhile, that’s flexibility that the Rams would have with Alexander. Alexander was set to have a $24.3 million cap hit in 2025, but won’t be getting close to that with a new deal. The now former Packers cornerback has played in just 14 games over the last two years. That’s going to take a hit on his value and is one of the main reasons the Packers released him.', 'If the Rams could sign Alexander for somewhere between the Kristian Fulton contract at $10 million per year and the DJ Reed contract at $16 million per year and incentivize it, they could make it work. Unlike other teams who might be interested, such as the Buffalo Bills, the Rams have $19.4 million in cap space.', 'At the same time, if the Rams don’t get Alexander and instead he signs with a team like the Dallas Cowboys, it takes a team out of the Jalen Ramsey sweepstakes. A scenario like that helps the Rams in negotiations with the Dolphins as it limits the trade options.', 'However, an argument could be made that the Rams should focus their attention on Alexander. Again, it wouldn’t require draft capital and the Rams would have more control over the contract structure. Alexander is also two years younger than Ramsey.', 'While he’s been hurt the last two years, when he’s played, he’s been a top-level cornerback. Among cornerbacks with at least 350 snaps last season, Alexander was PFF’s eighth-rated cornerback. He allowed just 56 percent of his targets, which ranked 16th. His PFF coverage grade, reception percentage, and passer rating allowed all would have led Rams cornerbacks. Alexander also outperformed Ramsey in all three categories.', 'It’s still possible that the Rams stand pat with who they have and ride into the season with the current cornerback group. With that said, the Rams have made additions this late in the offseason in the past. It was this time of year that the Rams signed Ahkello Witherspoon and Demarcus Robinson in 2022.', 'The Rams front office has done a good job in recent years when it comes to patience and remaining disciplined. That’s how they’ve approached the Jalen Ramsey situation and it might pay off once again. The Rams have shown that they’re not afraid to wait for the right move and it’s possible that move is Jaire Alexander.', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Packers expected to release CB Jaire Alexander: 6 potential landing spots,https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-packers-release-jaire-alexander-potential-landing-spots,"['2YAJBJ5 Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander (23) on defense against the Arizona Cardinals during a NFL game Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, in Green Bay, Wis. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps', 'Estimated Reading Time: 6 minutes', 'The NFL offseason never stays quiet for long, and the Green Bay Packers reminded us of that by releasing star cornerback Jaire Alexander on Monday.', 'The move comes after months of the two sides reportedly trying to find common ground on a contract restructure for Alexander, who is one of the best cornerbacks in the league when healthy but has struggled to stay on the field.', 'The last time Alexander played more than 1,000 snaps in a single season (starting 15 of 16 games), he earned an elite 91.1 PFF coverage grade, allowed fewer than 400 receiving yards and broke up 14 passes. But that was in 2020. Since then, he has played more than 15 games in a season just once (2022). In 2021, he saw action in just four games due to a shoulder injury. In 2023, he played just seven games due to back and shoulder issues. And in 2024, he logged snaps in just seven games again, this time due to a quad injury and, later, a PCL injury. ', 'While Alexander has never recorded a single-season PFF coverage grade below 73.0 in his career, the best ability is availability. According to Jason Fitzgerald of Over The Cap, with this move coming after June 1, the Packers will split $17 million in dead money into $7.5 million in 2025 and $9.5 million in 2026, with overall cap savings of $17.2 million this year and $17.5 million next year.', 'At just 28 years old, and as one of the most competitive players in the league, Alexander’s time in the league isn’t over. Let’s look at some potential landing spots.', 'We have to throw this one in here because, well, it’s the Eagles. Part of their run to the Super Bowl last year was capitalizing on players like this becoming available and forming the best team in the league. Alexander was also born in Philadelphia, though he grew up mostly in North Carolina.', 'The Eagles have Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean in their secondary, two players who were excellent as rookie starters in 2024. But they did lose Darius Slay, as well as Isaiah Rodgers, from their Super Bowl secondary. Perhaps Alexander would take a big discount to be the veteran in the room for a team looking for another title. ', ""The Rams surprisingly didn't make any changes at cornerback this offseason. Darious Williams (865), Cobie Durant (843) and Ahkello Witherspoon (598) played the most snaps at cornerback for the team last season, but none earned a PFF coverage grade above 62.0."", ""Alexander is the kind of veteran whom Los Angeles has been interested in before. The team traded for fellow star cornerback Jalen Ramsey in 2019, which proved a worthwhile addition. A move for Alexander wouldn’t be as big of a splash, but it would be in the Rams' wheelhouse. "", ""This would be a top-tier storyline. Alexander and Vikings star receiver Justin Jefferson have been fierce competitors for years, taking the Packers and Vikings' divisional rivalry to the next level. Alexander has called one of Jefferson’s biggest performances — nine catches for 184 yards and two touchdowns against the Packers — a “fluke” and has mocked Jefferson’s signature griddy celebration."", 'Alexander would also fit into defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ aggressive approach with his 99th-percentile PFF coverage grade since 2022 and all of his ball production (eight interceptions and 21 pass breakups despite missed time). The Vikings are trying to replace Camryn Bynum, Shaquill Griffin and Stephon Gilmore from last year’s secondary, making Alexander a clear potential fit.', 'This is another example of a team going all-in if the signing were to happen. The Ravens lost Brandon Stephens from last year’s secondary but still have Marlon Humphrey to play inside and out, as well as second-year cornerback Nate Wiggins, who could be in for a big season after earning a 69.0 PFF coverage grade as a rookie with 11 forced incompletions.', ""Baltimore signed Chidobe Awuzie to a one-year deal this offseason, but Alexander would be an upgrade over Awuzie's 62.4 and 58.3 PFF coverage grades over the past two seasons."", ""This one feels a bit out of left field, but stick with us. The Panthers' secondary under defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero last season was fairly aggressive, playing single-high coverages 66.4% of the time. They used Cover 3 more than Cover 1, running the zone scheme on 38.7% of snaps compared to 16.9% in 2023."", ""Alexander's 98th-percentile PFF coverage grade over the past three years in single-coverage situations is evidence of his impact from a single-high alignment as a cornerback who can succeed in both man and zone situations when there is only one safety deep."", 'Making this move would depend on where the Panthers believe they are in their competing window, but they would surely be interested at the right price. It would also be somewhat of a homecoming for Alexander, who played football at Rocky River High School just outside of the Charlotte area.', ""Now that Pete Carroll is the head coach in Las Vegas, don't count the Raiders out of the Alexander sweepstakes. Carroll knows how to build an elite secondary, as evidenced by the Legion of Boom during his time in Seattle. He is also known as a player’s coach and someone who can handle big-personality players."", ""Despite playing in a tough division, we know the Raiders are in on competing now since they traded for quarterback Geno Smith.

His contributions to our organization were felt on the field, in the locker room and in our community, and he will be missed,"" Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said in a statement. ""We appreciate all he gave and we wish him all the best moving forward.""', ""Alexander had planned to report for the Packers' mandatory minicamp starting Tuesday after skipping all of the in-person, voluntary workouts this offseason."", 'Alexander appeared in just seven regular-season games each of the past two seasons and did not play after Nov. 17 last year -- despite practicing on a semi-regular basis. He went on injured reserve the final week of the season and had knee surgery on what he said was a torn PCL. Still, he finished second on the team in pass breakups (seven) and tied for second in interceptions (two).', 'That came a year after shoulder and knee injuries plus a one-game suspension for conduct detrimental to the team limited him to seven games.', '""The reality is for the last four years for Jaire, it\'s about half of the games he\'s been able to play,"" Packers president Mark Murphy told WBAY-TV earlier Monday. ""So we kind of have been used to it.""', 'The 2018 first-round pick had two years remaining on the four-year, $84 million contract extension that made him the highest-paid cornerback in the NFL at the time.

""When you have a player who\'s done what he\'s done for us in the past, and then not being able to get him out on the field consistently, that\'s tough. You know it\'s tough on the player, tough on the organization.""', 'Gutekunst also said during the offseason that he would be open to trading Alexander.', ""After the draft came and went without a trade, the Packers considered keeping Alexander, but only if he would be willing to rework his contract. The Packers went so far as to offer Alexander a revised deal in recent days, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, but the two sides could not reach an agreement."", 'Alexander was scheduled to make $17.5 million this season, but none of that was guaranteed.', 'He seemed to know the end was coming immediately after the season, when on locker cleanout day he declined to speak with reporters, saying that he had ""nothing good to say"" and that he did not know if he would be back in 2025.', 'In seven seasons, including playoffs, Alexander recorded 15 interceptions.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXJVM0oxYkU0M1FURllSakZFVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZEZZYk1LUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

And here’s how it goes: The new of the planned termination is leaked. The phone rings. A deal gets done before the player becomes a free agent.', 'The question becomes whether another team wants to secure Alexander’s services at a base salary of $16.15 million in 2025 and $18.15 million in 2026. Would the Packers pay some of it in order to essentially buy a draft pick?', 'Then there’s the question of whether Alexander would even welcome a trade. Even without a no-trade clause, a new team may not want to inherit a headache in the form of someone who doesn’t want to be there.', 'Still, making it known early in the day gives the Packers until 4:00 p.m. ET to get a deal done.

The two sides previously agreed to explore trade options while working on a contract restructure. No deal materialized, however, and the Packers ultimately moved on. The timing and recent injury history could complicate the process of Alexander finding a new team for the upcoming season, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones.', 'Although Alexander developed into one of the NFL\'s premier cornerbacks, his availability became a growing concern. He missed significant time in three of the past four seasons, including back-to-back years in 2023 and 2024 when he appeared in just seven games each. Alexander also received a Week 17 suspension due to ""conduct detrimental to the team,"" further clouding his long-term outlook in Green Bay.', 'A shoulder injury limited him to just four games in 2021, but he returned in 2022 to earn second-team All-Pro honors, reaffirming his status as a top-tier defensive back when healthy.', ""In seven seasons with the Packers, Alexander totaled 12 interceptions, 70 passes defensed and 287 tackles over 78 games.
