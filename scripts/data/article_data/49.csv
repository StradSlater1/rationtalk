Echo Valley is here to usher us into a new era of maternal storytelling,https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/film/echo-valley-apple-tv/991431,"['', 'CREDIT: APPLE TV+', 'FILM', 'BY\nKAYLEIGH DRAY', '2 DAYS AGO', '4 MIN READ', 'Echo Valley, starring Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney, is less “mama knows best”, more “mum has secrets… and a shovel”.', 'Once upon a time, in the bad old days, pop culture mothers came in just two flavours: saint or villain. They were basically either Marmee from Little Women, dispensing wisdom and baked goods with self-sacrificing grace, or they were monsters: cold, cruel, absent, manipulative (see: Mommie Dearest, Carrie or Cinderella). There wasn’t much space in between.', 'Thankfully, though, there’s been a seismic shift in perspective over the years. And Echo Valley, Apple TV+’s new mother-daughter thriller starring Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney, might just be the perfect symbol of that change.', 'Promising edge-of-your-seat suspense from start to finish, Moore stars as the enigmatic Kate, a grieving woman who has cloistered herself away on a remote farm in Pennsylvania so that she can tend to her horses and give riding lessons. She’s fragile, true, but that vulnerability belies a quiet inner strength – one which is put to the test when her troubled daughter Claire (Sweeney) appears on Kate’s doorstep, utterly hysterical and covered in someone else’s blood.', 'Watch the trailer for Echo Valley below:', 'Now, Claire and Kate aren’t on the best terms; the former is an addict, volatile and manipulative, while the latter is struggling to contend with secrets, trauma and guilt. Theirs is not a cupcakes-and-counselling set-up; it’s an estranged relationship shaped by silence, sacrifice and things unspoken. ', 'Yet, as Kate pieces together the shocking truth of what happened, she learns just how far a mother will go to try to save her child… and the moral boundaries she’s willing to cross.', '“I’m kind of curious what the reaction will be,” Moore told Vanity Fair. “There will be a sense, certainly, among parents going, like, ‘well, would I do that? How far would I go?’ You’re left with those questions.”', 'Maternal love at its messiest, then? You’d best believe that’s becoming a trend; where once the “good mum” archetype meant unwavering support, quiet strength and an almost divine patience (once again, Marmee, we salute you), today’s onscreen mothers are allowed messiness. Rage. Regret. Whole internal lives. And it makes them more compelling – and more relatable – than ever.', 'CREDIT: APPLE TV+', 'Take Ginny & Georgia, for example, where Georgia is a fiercely protective, chaotic survivor who makes terrible choices with the best intentions. Or Bridgerton, where Violet is finally stepping beyond her role as the maternal head of the family to pursue her own desires. Or Fleishman Is In Trouble, which offered us up a mother who simply disappeared – not because she didn’t love her family, but because she was drowning.', 'It’s part of a broader movement in pop culture that allows women to be antiheroes, not just caretakers. Think Mare of Easttown. Big Little Lies. The Handmaid’s Tale. Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy, even! These women are no longer simply nurturing; they’re complex, flawed, sometimes frightening, and all too grimly aware of the fact that they were people, real people, before they became mothers – no matter what their families or society might think. Still, their love for their children, however fractured, runs deep.', 'Compare that to the maternal roles of decades past. Gilmore Girls’ Lorelai might have been messy, but her brand of chaos was cute, harmless, fast-talking and latte-fuelled. Little Women’s Marmee, as iconic as she is, rarely let herself even so much as furrow a brow, no matter how trying her daughters might be at that moment. ', 'And those are the women that even make it onto the screen at all, of course; most “good mothers” of pop culture are long dead and buried, whether that be in a Netflix romcom, a Disney fairytale or even something like Mamma Mia 2 (RIP Donna). ', 'CREDIT: APPLE TV+', 'In Echo Valley, we get our aforementioned daughter covered in blood, and a mother who has to decide what to do next. It’s high drama, yes, but it’s also symbolic of the emotional baggage passed down between generations, of the hidden wounds that shape how we parent and how we’re parented.', 'And that, really, is what modern mother-daughter stories are beginning to interrogate: not just what a “good mum” looks like, but what happens when love and damage coexist. When the person who raised you is both your greatest ally and your most painful inheritance. When the person you’re raising is the best thing in your life, even as they utterly and spectacularly derail it. ', 'So no, we don’t need every mum on screen to be wielding a literal weapon, braving fires and diving into lakes to save their kids from certain peril (although, y’know, thrilling). We do, however, need them to feel real. And in 2025 and beyond, that means allowing mothers to be more than just side characters in their children’s lives. It means giving them backstories, flaws, secrets – and yes, maybe even blood on their hands.', 'Bring on the mess.', 'Echo Valley will become available for streaming via Apple TV+ on 13 June.', 'Images: Apple TV+', 'TOPICS', 'JULIANNE MOORE', 'SYDNEY SWEENEY', 'THRILLER', 'APPLE TV+', 'SHARE THIS ARTICLE', 'LOGIN TO FAVOURITE', 'Sign in once and stay logged in to access everything you love about Stylist in one place.', 'Works on iOS and Android', 'By signing up you agree to occasionally receive offers and promotions from Stylist.

First, the original thriller is quite the opposite of all things romantic.

The Oscar-winning actor stars alongside Sydney Sweeney in Michael Pearce’s latest film, written by “Mare of Easttown” scribe Brad Inglesby.', 'The story follows “so much about this woman’s life, about what she wants, what she’s lost, what she’s trying to hang on to, and I think that she’s at a point where she really feels that she has nothing left to lose,” she told IndieWire. “When you have stakes like that in a film, it’s exciting. That’s what I’m drawn to, isn’t it?”', '', 'Director Pearce mused that working with Moore was one of his highlights of the project. “Working with Julianne, someone that’s so experienced, seeing her have the excitable energy of a 20-something-year-old actor who was on their first set, she was like that almost every day — I think that was just edifying,” he told us.', '“As a director, you can get so neurotic and beaten by the process, and the schedule’s hard, and you lose the location, or you didn’t get a full scene, and you can walk in a bit broken,” he said. “She was just a reminder each day about why we do it, that we’re here to have fun, to play, and we should feel privileged to make movies. I think that’s just something I think about, that however hard it is, it’s like you’re in a sandbox for adults.”', '', 'As for Moore, she recently attended the Cannes premiere of Wes Anderson’s “The Phoenician Scheme” on May 18. I asked her if she would ever be interested in working with the auteur and she said, “I would. I think it would be so wonderful. Everybody’s work is so stellar in that film.” As someone who has attended the festival upwards of a dozen times, the excitement doesn’t wane. “One of the exciting things about Cannes is that you stand there as the film premieres and you get to look at the actors and filmmakers’ faces as it’s happening and it’s incredible.”', 'Moore recently told us that she will indeed be showing off her vocal chops in Jesse Eisenberg’s upcoming A24 musical, a follow-up to singing a little bit in 2021’s “Dear Evan Hansen”: “Yes, I am. I’m singing. We’re all singing in it,” she said.', '“Jesse Eisenberg is just the most extraordinary person,” she continued. “He’s so incredibly creative. I feel so fortunate to be able to work with him. This is very different, but I think that he can have sort of a satirical worldview. At the end of the day, he’s got so much feeling. We’re all very excited about it.”', '“Echo Valley” premieres June 13 on Apple TV+. Check out the trailer below.', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

‘Echo Valley’ Review: Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney Star in Apple TV+’s Satisfyingly Tense Domestic Thriller,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/echo-valley-review-julianne-moore-sydney-sweeney-apple-tv-1236235917/,"['', '', ""A bereaved mother must decide how far she will go for her daughter in Michael Pearce's film, also featuring Domhnall Gleeson, Fiona Shaw and Kyle MacLachlan."", 'BY LOVIA GYARKYE', '', 'Ever since her partner Patty (Kristina Valada-Viars) died nine months ago, mornings have been hard for Kate Garretson (Julianne Moore), the bereaved protagonist of Michael Pearce’s gratifying domestic thriller Echo Valley. The horse rancher wakes up with visible sadness, which the camera (cinematography is by Benjamin Kracun) meditates on throughout the film. In the movie’s first moments, a startled Kate, emerging from the grips of a nightmare, opens her eyes and takes a deep breath before sitting up. Her feet dangle, then land with a thud on the delicate rug hugging the side of her bed. Kate’s routines are plagued by a similar heaviness. ', '', 'Patty’s unexpected death rocked Kate’s world, and she has been struggling to maintain the ranch, a sprawling tract of green foliage in Chester, Pennsylvania. Grief keeps Kate from teaching her usual riding lessons; she can barely afford to replace the roof of her barn. So when her daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney), an itinerant drug addict, shows up asking for money, Kate knows she must refuse — but a part of her can’t. ', '', 'Working from a compelling screenplay penned by Brad Ingelsby (Mare of Easttown), Pearce explores the depths of maternal devotion. The film’s intimate scope — emotional betrayals provide the real thrills here — as well as its melancholic atmosphere and solid performances make this a satisfying streamer option. Echo Valley indeed understands its premise and fulfills its obligations. The film takes some eyebrow-raising turns, indulging in twists that require suspending disbelief, but they don’t completely detract from an entertaining whole. Much of that is thanks to Pearce’s assured direction, which, anticipating when boredom might set in, experiments with mood in order to keep us guessing. ', '', 'As he proved in his previous films Beast and Encounter, Pearce has a knack for approaching familiar genres with a stylish retrofit. In Echo Valley, he turns Kate’s ranch, once a refuge from an asphyxiating life, into a space laden with the horrors of grief and desperation. Collaborating with Kracun (The Substance) and composer Jed Kurzel, Pearce favors muted colors, foreboding violins and robust emotions. Some of the most harrowing scenes involve Kate and Claire’s arguments about money and support. The volatility of their relationship is colored by mother and daughter’s respective sources of grief: Kate for her dead wife and Claire for the person she never became. Sweeney plays the substance-dependent young adult with some of the same nervous unpredictability her Euphoria co-star Zendaya brings to Rue, her character on that HBO drama. ', 'When we first meet Claire, she is a ball of jitters and half-truths. She returns to her mother’s ranch to check her messages because her boyfriend Ryan (Edmund Donovan) broke her phone during one of their many fraught arguments. Thrilled to see her daughter, Kate capitulates to Claire’s every demand and rarely asks any follow-up questions. The two share tender moments before Claire asks her mother for money again. But this time Kate really doesn’t have any: Without steady clients, she’s been forced to borrow from her ex-husband (Kyle MacLachlan), a powerful lawyer in Philadelphia.', 'Claire, only concerned with her needs and the latest mess she’s found herself in, doesn’t believe her mom. She demands money to help Ryan pay back their dealer Jackie (Domhnall Gleeson, thrilling as a villain), a slippery and scarily clever figure. Kate and Claire end up in a ferocious fight that results in the daughter angrily driving away and the mother shaken to her core. The conflict is a jolting moment for Kate, and it opens up Moore’s performance — on the subtler side until this point — to more wrenching depths.', '', 'The real action doesn’t kick off until Claire returns to the farm with a body wrapped in plastic. She frantically relays a story about her and Ryan’s latest fight, which resulted in his death. Kate asks no questions and quickly leaps into action, disposing of the corpse and reviewing a fabricated story with Claire. Her dedication to her daughter eventually ensnares her in a conspiracy bigger than she could have imagined. Now, Kate must piece together what happened between Claire, Ryan and Jackie.', 'Meanwhile, she’s also navigating the undulations of her grief, which feels less piercing with the help of her close friend Leslie (Fiona Shaw). Intimate moments with Les — whether the two are dancing to Robyn in her living room or feeding the horses — offer necessary moments of respite for both Kate and the viewer. ', 'Echo Valley takes some genuinely gripping turns as well as a few unbelievable detours in its journey through Kate’s increasingly complicated life and relationship with her daughter. Even as the web gets sticky, Pearce maintains control of each thread with his steady direction. The handful of overly contrived moments disappoint, but don’t amount to an insurmountable betrayal, because Echo Valley delivers where it matters.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVphSGRoYTA5SU0xZzNZa2g2VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney strain to save uninspired thriller Echo Valley,https://www.avclub.com/echo-valley-review,"['Echo Valley, starring Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney, is scripted by Brad Ingelsby, a prolific writer who, by way of works like Mare Of Easttown, American Woman, and The Way Back, has displayed a touch for original, redemptive stories rooted strongly in character. His latest effort, though, a listless drama less than the sum of its parts, has more the feeling of an uninspired adaptation of middling beach-read fiction.', 'Set in rural Pennsylvania, Echo Valley centers on Kate Garretson (Moore), who starts each day on her small farm listening to old voicemail messages from her late wife, whose death has left Kate detached from her sole remaining source of income, giving horse-riding lessons to local teens. She has people who care about her, including old friend Leslie (Fiona Shaw), but exists day-to-day in a bit of a haze.', '', 'In need of a roof repair, Kate begs $9,000 off of her ex-husband Richard (Kyle MacLachlan), with whom she shares a troubled adult daughter. Claire (Sweeney) has bounced in and out of rehab, struggling with addiction, and when she shows up at her mother’s house after a fight with her boyfriend, Kate at first thinks it’s just another typical argument.', 'In throwing away most of her boyfriend’s possessions, however, Claire has created a debt owed to Jackie Lyman (Domhnall Gleeson), a dangerous local drug dealer. Kate works to settle this account, but after Claire returns late one night, hysterical and dotted with blood that isn’t hers, Kate is forced to grapple with just how far she’ll go to help her daughter.', '', 'The film’s second and third acts—encompassing both a criminal cover-up and the obligatory unraveling of that kept secret, which presents in turn an even thornier complication—position it nominally as a thriller. But Echo Valley, directed by Michael Pearce (Beast, Encounter), apportions its screen time in odd ways. Without spoiling any specifics, these choices neither create effective misdirection nor dig down into relationship dynamics in a way that might radically deepen or alter the audience’s understanding of its main characters.', 'The result is a movie that doesn’t so much tap a hearty vein of mounting tension as just operate in a weird middle ground, emotionally speaking. Then, after dropping a reasonably compelling if not exactly shocking twist at the end of the second act, the back stretch of Echo Valley hinges on the implementation of an incredibly stupid plan.', 'There is an argument to be made for films in which not-very-smart characters make not-very-smart choices. (Dumb people deserve representation too.) But Echo Valley never once asks viewers to make that type of buy-in in this case.', 'So when a character, possessing leverage and attempting to use it, makes a completely arbitrary and incongruous choice about how to press their advantage, and then additionally introduces a random, strained need to “get out of town” for a bit, it’s so utterly baffling as to defy belief of it as an original scripted choice. It feels instead like the clunky plot device of a book adaptation that, in getting sanded down and transferred from one medium to another, is dutifully retained from the source material, but without a proper or convincing set-up.

However, their relationship takes an unexpected turn when Claire shows up on Kate’s doorstep, hysterical and covered in someone else’s blood. Kate will go to any lengths possible to clear her daughter’s name and protect her from outside threats, which are more dangerous than she could have ever imagined.', 'But in this exclusive clip with Moore and Sweeney, it’s obvious that Claire needs more assistance than Kate can possibly provide (and it has nothing to do with money).

‘Echo Valley’ Review: Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney Elevate an Otherwise Generic Crime Thriller,https://www.thewrap.com/echo-valley-review-julianne-moore-sydney-sweeney-apple/,"['It’s Moore murder, Moore problems in the Apple TV+ feature from filmmaker Michael Pearce', 'If movies have taught us anything it’s that if someone asks you to dispose of a dead body, you say “no.” In fact, movies have taught us this valuable lesson so many times and for so many decades that I’m genuinely shocked when anyone — even in movies — still thinks it’s a smart idea in a dead body situation. There are only two possibilities why this plot point would still be so prevalent: 1. People actually do it in real life all the time (which is a creepy thought) or 2. People generally want the plot of a movie to, you know, happen … so you can’t have everybody doing the smart thing and resolving all their problems halfway through.', '“Echo Valley” is the latest in a long line of crime movies where someone gets involved in a dead body situation and makes the snap decision to dispose of the thing. Julianne Moore plays Kate, a grieving widow who can barely keep her horse ranch from falling apart. Sydney Sweeney plays her daughter, Claire, a drug addict who abuses her mother’s love at every turn. When Claire comes home one night, covered in somebody else’s blood (a very inconvenient thing to be covered in), Kate decides to do something about it.', 'What she does would be rude to reveal, not because it’s terribly clever but because “Echo Valley” takes its sweet time getting to the “story” part of the story, and I don’t want to yuck anyone’s murder movie yum. Suffice it to say it all goes very badly, very quickly. But not so badly that you’d be thrilled by it. It’s more like you’re vaguely interested, in a general crime-y way.', 'The plot of “Echo Valley” is the worst part of it. The plot makes sense, to the extent that films of this ilk ever do (read: don’t think about it much), but there’s a reason why it takes so long to go for jugular, suspense-wise. For about 40 minutes we’re just spending time with Moore, a great proposition in just about any film, while she acts opposite Sweeney, who is no slouch in the acting department either. “Echo Valley” earns the moment where Kate makes a very bad decision, because I believe she’d make it. Maybe. Some of it anyway.', 'I have a theory that the best genre films are the films that would be interesting without the genre parts. If you care so much about the teenagers in a slasher movie that you’d happily watch them not die for a few hours, then it makes all the difference when they do die. The same goes for crime films. If a filmmaker like Michael Pearce (“Encounter”) can make characters like Kate and Claire matter so much that you’d just watch them talk about their problems instead of, you know, doing crimes, it won’t matter what happens to them because the audience will be riveted either way.', 'But “Echo Valley” puts a strain on that theory. The story of Kate and Claire is familiar territory, as far as tales of addicted children and long-suffering parents go. But Moore and Sweeney are captivating performers under just about any circumstances. So when their lives do turn into a Hitchcock riff it should be exciting cinema. Pearce and screenwriter Brad Ingelsby (“Mare of Easttown”) make all the narrative space to build this investment, but the plot still manages to bog it down. It’s just not terribly clever, and not terribly harrowing.', 'That said, we can still latch onto Moore, whose journey through grief by way of enablement hits some high notes whenever she’s just living her life. When things get bad, really bad, she absconds to her friend’s house, played by Fiona Shaw, drinking wine and swapping stories about getting caught with other women by conservative neighbors, and being protected by an excellent mother. There’s something potent in here about the way women — particularly queer women, and middle-aged women — have each other’s backs and will go to any length to protect each other. “Echo Valley” could have got more mileage off out of this, but eventually it has to get back to murder and blackmail, a.k.a. the stuff it doesn’t do best.', 'There are a couple of haunting images in “Echo Valley,” especially a shot with Moore and a villainous Domhnall Gleeson that employs an evocative use of slow-motion, and overall it’s a competent project. But it’s a film that struggles to find its identity, and by the time it does, it’s already spent so much time wading through ho-hum criminality that the best parts never get to soar. Moore is great, Sweeney cuts loose and Shaw is reliably excellent. Smart storytelling decisions were made. Other decisions were made too. It adds up to a potpourri of general genre genericness, never making enough noise to rattle, or even produce an echo.', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVphSGRoYTA5SU0xZzNZa2g2VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Her made-to-measure couture dress featured a fitted corset bodice that gave way to a hand-draped, peplum-like detail at the waist.', 'The main focal point, however, was the dress’s billowing skirt, which fanned out dramatically from Sweeney’s hips.

‘Echo Valley’ Review: Sydney Sweeney and Julianne Moore Star in a Mother-Daughter Murder Story That’s Luridly Entertaining Until It Loses Focus,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/echo-valley-review-sydney-sweeney-julianne-moore-apple-tv-1235130150/,"['', 'The most beautiful and dangerous thing about parent-child relationships is that they’re always changing, even as the love that holds them in place never does. ', 'It’s beautiful, of course, that newly widowed horse mom Kate (Julianne Moore) would still do anything for her precious Claire (Sydney Sweeney, raw enough to plow through some very goofy dialogue), even though the once-adoring little girl has matured into a shrieky, manipulative drug addict who now sees her mom as a hindrance to scoring heroin. The danger there, as we see over the course of Michael Pearce’s luridly enjoyable “Echo Valley,” is that doing “anything” for her full-grown junkie daughter requires a very different kind of commitment from Kate than it did when Claire was a kid. Back in the day it probably just meant buying her a pony for their farm. Now it means dumping her boyfriend’s dead body in the nearest lake so that Claire won’t go to jail for “accidentally” bashing his brains in with a rock. The contract is the same, but the terms have grown a bit more complicated.', '', 'Scripted by “Mare of Easttown” writer Brad Ingelsby, and soaked in a similar fear of white suburban rot, this protean Apple TV+ thriller works best when it operates by the same principle. The first half of the film seems to shift into a different genre every few minutes; what starts as a chilly grief drama about a depressed New Jersey lesbian who can’t pay her farm bills — to the great annoyance of her rich landowner ex-husband, played by a fiery Kyle MacLachlan in a one-scene cameo that feels like an unresolved parenthetical — sours into a Cassavetes-loud heartwrencher when Claire shows up at her mother’s door in desperate need of help. ', '', 'But that vibe — and the domestic violence that comes with it — lasts just long enough to set up a very different sort of movie. You see, Claire thought it would be funny to throw her “fuckface” boyfriend’s stuff off a local bridge, but she failed to realize that $10,000 of his dealer’s heroin was bundled up inside of it. Womp womp. Now the couple has to come up with the money themselves, or Jackie is going to kill them both (he’s played by a scummy as hell Domhnall Gleeson, who predictably delights in a role that allows him to subvert the inherent kindness of his demeanor). And as if that weren’t bad enough, the stakes get raised even higher when Claire returns to the horse farm a few days later covered in her boyfriend’s blood and crying for her mommy.', 'Not only will Kate do anything to help, but — suddenly endowed with the sort of preternatural confidence that some parents are able to muster from the worst of their panic — she also seems to know exactly how to do it. Moore has always displayed a rare gift for revealing her characters’ inner strength by allowing us to watch them unravel (see: the pharmacy scene in “Magnolia”), and she conveys so much about the ineffable weight of motherhood through Kate’s wounded but unflinching reaction to the crisis that Claire lays at her feet. No joke: There was a brief stretch of this story where I thought it might turn out that Kate used to kill people for a living, but “retired assassin forced back into the game” is one of the few sub-genres that “Echo Valley” doesn’t entertain.', '', '“It must be fucking awful having a kid like that,” Jackie snarls to her at one point. “Always having to clean up their shit.” But a sociopath like him could never understand that “having to clean up someone’s shit” can be the most affirming obligation this world has to offer, even if that shit is a lot messier than any parent would ever want for their child. ', 'That’s why “Echo Valley” is at its richest and most self-possessed during the fleeting moments when it seems like dumping a body at the bottom of a lake might be the magic bullet that brings these two women back together again. The unconditionality of Kate’s love for her daughter is put to the test, and — grim as the circumstances of that test might be — there’s something inescapably tender about how Kate passes it with flying colors. In the absence of her late wife, and the unfortunate proximity of her sniveling ex-husband, Kate can’t help but exalt in the purity of the affection she’ll always have for Claire. ', 'Alas, Pearce (“Beast,” “Encounter”) does better with ambivalent threats than he does with emotional openness, and Ingelsby’s script is too eager to shift into yet another different gear for “Echo Valley” to kindle any lasting warmth from its mother-daughter murder duo. Opting to embrace an increasingly soapy and sordid crime saga at the exact moment when it should be growing closer to its characters, the movie fatally diverts its attention from the unconditional love between them. At first it seems as if the story is pivoting to focus on the imbalance of that relationship, but Claire soon disappears from the picture entirely, leaving Kate to clean up the mess with Jackie by herself. ', '', 'There’s some fun to be had in watching “Echo Valley” shift into a battle of wits between Moore and Gleeson, as both actors mine devious nuance from the thin gruel of a paperback thriller (though I was just as amused by the movie’s growing reliance on Apple software, and by whatever corporate machinations led to Verizon getting a shoutout instead of AT&T). But “Echo Valley” loses its reason for being as soon as its self-impressed third act decides to focus on Kate’s resourcefulness at the expense of her emotional responsibility. ', 'This movie can get away with murder so long as it’s about a mother turning into a master criminal because her daughter is in danger — a perfect summer riff on the concept of a parent who finds the strength to lift a car when it rolls over their child. It’s only when Kate becomes the subject of Jackie’s ire that “Echo Valley” blunders away the source of its power. Without that unconditional love to hold it together, this movie’s volatile changes can’t help but obscure the essence of a story about what it really means for some things to always stay the same. ', '“Echo Valley” is now playing in select theaters. It will be available to stream on Apple TV+ starting Friday, June 13.', 'Want to stay up to date on IndieWire’s film reviews and critical thoughts?

Commissioned by Sweeney and her longtime stylist, Molly Dickson, Vera Wang created a custom ballgown for the actor's special night. Per the atelier, the crimson red design was constructed of Italian silk and featherweight faille. The strapless bodice featured a crumb-catcher neckline that flared up at each side. Her natural waistline cinched at the middle before stretching out into a hand-draped peplum atop the floor-length skirt. Layers upon layers of tulle petticoats peeked out from underneath the regal gown."", ""To ensure all eyes went to Wang's work, Sweeney accessorized with minimal jewelry. Instead of a necklace, bracelets, and rings, she only wore stud diamond earrings, courtesy of Kwiat."", ""Once the curtain closed at the Apple TV+ film's screening, Sweeney changed into a little red dress for the after-party. The leading lady dressed the part in a Vivienne Westwood-esque midi, complete with off-the-shoulder sleeves and a delicately-draped neckline. Marking her second LRD of the evening, it was in the same crimson shade as her ballgown."", ""Sweeney's footwear was hidden during her first look of the night.

Earlier that day, she was spotted in a nautical number from Coperni Fall 2025. Sweeney paired the vest and skirt with knee-high boots, Alexander McQueen sunglasses, and the Miu Miu Acadie Bag—a fitting selection for the brand ambassador."", ""As the premiere's official step-and-repeat drew near, Sweeney delivered her final street style set: a menswear-inspired moment by Oscar de la Renta. Always on board for monochrome, the 27-year-old sported a plaid button-down with the coordinating trousers. Her baby blue heels brought out the set's matching stripes. To finish, Sweeney carried the Poppy Tote Bag, also from the New York label."", ""Unlike her months-long Immaculate press tour last summer, she fit her Echo Valley events into only a few days. At this point, she's mastered the art of a speedy promo trail. This week, Sweeney debuted six stellar looks in under 48 hours—and gave the extra-oversize ballgown its due while she was at it.
