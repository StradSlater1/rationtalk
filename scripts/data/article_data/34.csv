Apple announces watchOS 26 with a wrist flick gesture and AI ‘Workout Buddy’,https://www.theverge.com/news/679225/apple-watchos-26-wwdc-features,"['Yes, 26 — Apple has skipped a few version numbers since last year’s watchOS 11.', '', 'Apple just announced watchOS 26, the latest version of its Apple Watch operating system, at WWDC 2025. It’s been updated with Liquid Glass, Apple’s new transparent design language; a new wrist flick gesture to dismiss notifications; and an AI-powered “Workout Buddy” that gives you pep talks as you exercise.', 'watchOS 26 is the follow-up to last year’s watchOS 11 release, but Apple has jumped its numbering up to match the upcoming year in a bid to standardize its operating system names, so that the watchOS numbering now matches iOS, macOS, and Apple’s other software platforms. As in previous years, developer access starts today, with a public beta to follow next month. The full release is coming this fall alongside the new Apple Watches.', 'Liquid Glass, the new design language Apple is introducing across its software this year, applies throughout the OS. The new transparent aesthetic will apply to widgets, notifications, the Control Center, in-app controls, and more. It’s also coming to the Photos watch face, which will now display transparent numerals that won’t block your view of the photos.', 'Notification management should be a little smoother thanks to a new gesture control. On an Apple Watch 9 or later, a flick of the wrist will dismiss notifications or incoming calls, silence timers and alarms, and take you back to your watch face. The OS can also track ambient noise levels and adjust the volume of notifications and incoming calls to match, reducing how often you need to set the watch to silent.', 'There are also new fitness features. The Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy uses workout and fitness data to generate not only personalized insights and advice, but pep talks, too. It’ll remind you what you’ve achieved in recent workouts and how close you are to your goals as you kick off an exercise session, let you know along the way if you cross a milestone, and recap your results at the end, letting you know if you hit a personal record along the way. It’ll work in English to start with, and across “the most popular” workout types.', 'The Workout app has had a redesign, too, with new corner buttons that serve as shortcuts to customize your workout or control your music. Apple Music will also do its best to recommend playlists based on the type of workout you’re doing and what it knows about your taste.', 'Apple Intelligence appears elsewhere too. If you have a Series 9 or later, and an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone, watchOS will support instant, automatic translation in Messages, both for incoming texts and any replies you send. Smart Replies are going to be a little smarter, and Messages will make contextual suggestions like starting a Check In if a friend asks you to let them know when you get home.', 'That sort of contextual behavior is coming to the Smart Stack as well, with Liquid Glass “hints” appearing on the display to suggest apps you might want to open. Apple says it could prompt you to start a Pilates workout when you arrive at the studio at your regular class time, or suggest Backtrack — which helps you retrace your steps — if you’re in a remote location with no signal.', 'Other updates include bringing the Notes app over to watchOS, allowing you to pin notes, create new ones, and tick off checklist entries. Hold Assist and Call Screening will work from your wrist too, and the watch can display live captions or offer remote controls when using Live Listen, Apple’s set of tools for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.', '“Apple Watch is an indispensable companion for millions of people around the world, and watchOS 26 uses intelligence to offer an even more personalized experience,” said David Clark, Apple’s senior director of watchOS engineering. “From a gorgeous new design, to Workout Buddy with Apple Intelligence, personalized music suggestions in the Workout app, and more intelligence in the Smart Stack and Messages, we’re excited about the many ways watchOS 26 will support each user in staying active, healthy, connected, and safe throughout their day.”', 'watchOS 11’s major additions last year were fitness features like Training Load and the ability to pause your Activity Rings for days off, along with the introduction of Live Activities and contextual widgets like Translate when you’re traveling or Shazam if you’re out and there’s music playing.', 'When watchOS 26 arrives this fall, it will be compatible with any Apple Watch from Series 6 onward, the second-generation Watch SE, and any Watch Ultra, and will have to be paired with an iPhone 11 or later. The Apple Intelligence features will only be available on certain models, however, and also require an iPhone capable of running Apple’s take on AI.', 'Related:', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

The feature will alert users if hypertension is detected, but it won't provide specific systolic and diastolic readings."", ""It's not yet clear if blood pressure monitoring is ready to launch due to developmental problems, so it's something that we might not see until the 2026 Apple Watch models."", ""Apple typically adds new workout types and features with new watchOS releases.

Apple has patented a method for rep tracking that uses the \u200ciPhone\u200c's camera."", ""In 2024, Apple submitted a patent for an Apple Watch feature that would be able to determine when the wearer is drowning, which would be a logical addition to crash detection and fall detection.

Like iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest, the latest generation of watchOS will now be appended with the upcoming year, instead of a sequential number. What would have been watchOS 12, is now watchOS 26."", 'Aside from the new name, there\'s a new look for watchOS, too. Apple gave its entire suite of software a redesign, one that takes aesthetic cues and draws on the ""physicality and richness"" of visionOS, the software used in the company\'s VR headset, the Vision Pro. It\'s the biggest redesign since iOS 7. The look is called ""liquid glass"" and dynamically reacts to movement and responds to the content on screen. Menus will better fit to the rounded corners of the hardware. Notifications and other information now involve translucent backgrounds, giving the interface a glass-like appearance.', 'The watchOS 26 also brings new features including Workout Buddy, an AI that will verbally talk you through your next run while also congratulating you on your accomplishments. The text-to-speech model is built on the voices of Fitness+ trainers and draws on data from your Workout and Health history. This is one of the first significant applications of Apple Intelligence to the Apple Watch. Workout Buddy will require an Apple Intelligence-supported iPhone nearby along with Bluetooth headphones connected to your watch.', 'Apple Intelligence upgrades will also make the Smart Stack more useful with a predictive algorithm that gathers information such as your location, time of day and routine to better bring up relevant apps in the Stack. The example given was showing you a workout card when you arrive at the gym in the morning.', 'In addition to the overall ""liquid glass"" revamp, the Workout app itself is getting a redesign with new buttons in each corner that should make it easier to customize your workouts. The app can also select an Apple Music playlist on your behalf based on the workout and your recent listening history.', ""Apple's AI will make Messages smarter in watchOS 26. Now, an analysis of your incoming messages will generate suggested replies, expanding on the current suite of quick replies — meaning you may actually want to use one of the canned responses. That should make it easier to communicate without puling out your phone. That's currently only available for devices with the language set to English."", ""Live Translation is also coming to Apple Watch. Incoming messages will be automatically displayed in your preferred language — and your outgoing messages will likewise translate for the person you're chatting with."", 'A couple of minor, but fun, updates include a redesigned watch face gallery and an updated Photos face that focuses on Featured content from your Photos library.', ""A new gesture will also let you dismiss messages — or other notifications — that you're not ready to deal with by flicking your wrist. A quick twist of your wrist away from you and back will return you to the watch screen. The wrist flick is available on the Series 9, Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2."", ""This latest suite of features join those announced during last year's WWDC, in which Apple previewed watchOS 11. The best of the bunch (for me anyway) was the ability to pause your Rings for a day in the Activity app. Other features included a Training Load metric that rates your efforts during exercise, comparing it with your output over time, and the Vitals app, which tracks overnight health metrics for those who wear their watch to bed."", ""Comparatively, the new features for watchOS 26 seem a bit more substantial than last year, particularly now that we're finally seeing Apple Intelligence making its way onto the wearable. Combined with the new liquid glass redesign, the new update feels significant this year, above just a general refresh."", ""The latest Apple Watch software will be available to those who are part of Apple's Beta software program starting next month. Developers will have access staring today. Everyone else should see watchOS 26 as a free software update this fall. It'll be available for Apple Watch Series 6 or later, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), and both Apple Watch Ultra models. The update requires a paired iPhone 11 or later running iOS 26, but the features that rely on Apple Intelligence (Workout Buddy, Live Translation) will require a paired iPhone 15 Pro or Max or any iPhone 16."", ""Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference kicked off yesterday, June 9.

Apple WatchOS 26 Announced: Workout Buddy and More Explained!,https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/06/apple-watchos-26-announced-workout-buddy-and-more-explained.html,"['Heads up! The big Garmin annual spring sale has started, with $200 off the Fenix 8 (first sale to date!), $100 off the Edge 1050, Forerunner 965 at $499, the Forerunner 265, the new Instinct 3, and countless other Garmin products including inReach Mini 2. Plus the Apple Watch Ultra 2 Black Titanium is on sale, and some Suunto & Wahoo product deals too. Full list & thoughts here!', '', '', 'It’s that time of year again, WWDC – Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference, where Apple outlines their software platform changes across all their devices. This annual event in June is essentially the start of the Apple release waterslide that begins now, and ends in September with the release of new hardware devices. Effectively, Apple announces the bulk of the new software features here in June, and then these end up on new phones, watches, and more that will typically start shipping in September. Of course, not every single feature that’ll be seen this fall will be announced here, they often save Apple-specific ones for announcement with new watches and new hardware.', 'Whereas the features here are typically focused on how 3rd party developers can leverage them. So we see bits like new application interfaces, programming interfaces, and more, being announced. Plus features that might need more user beta feedback for the next 3 months.', 'The first big announcement is the re-naming of WatchOS to be year-based (e.g. 2026), as opposed to version based. Thus, the new WatchOS version will be WatchOS 26, akin to new cars being named for the following year (2026 in this case). The same is true for iOS and all the other Apple platforms.', 'Apple is introducing new universal design across all their devices (phone, desktop, tablet, and yes, watch). This new language is called Liquid Glass, which Apple says will reflect with light (or the appearance of it), and makes menus and such appear to be encased in glass and float about background elements. Effectively like a liquidy glass surface that all the user interface elements float on.', 'With that, let’s talk about the WatchOS 26 features. After all, there’s tons of other sources for all the iOS/etc features.', '', 'With WatchOS 26, Apple brings Apple Intelligence to the Apple Watch for the first time. The first feature that’ll leverage Apple Intelligence is Workout Buddy, which effectively acts as a blend of always-positive Apple Fitness+ trainer/coach, and typical workout audio notifications that most watches on the market already have. This continues the trend of fitness features being the ‘main thing’ for Apple Watch, in terms of announcements at WWDC. Albeit, at a slightly less performance-oriented level than the past 2-3 years.', 'However, before we get to that, Apple has added a slate of other features to WatchOS 26, so let’s just run through them real quick:', '– New Liquid Glass design style, including translucence across the UI\n– Added automatic volume adjustment, changing notifications levels based on ambient noise (e.g. if in a noise place, it’ll increase notification levels)\n– Added wrist flick option to mute calls and do other quick actions\n– Added automatic call screening feature (seen/announced too for iOS 26)\n– Added hold assist for calls, which will keeps calls on hold (detecting background music), and notify you when human arrives\n– Added live language translations in Messages app on watch\n– Added configurable widgets\n– Added automatic smart actions to Messages, such as sharing your location if a conversation implies it wants it\n– Added Notes app to Apple Watch, letting you see your existing notes, and add to them\n– Revamped Smart Stack again, to be better at predicting things. For example if you walk into your gym as part of a routine, it learns to offer the Workout app when you do so\n– Added Personalized Workout Media, music feature will automatically offer a playlist to ‘fit’ the workout (e.g. based on intensity)\n– Added Controls Widget API for developers\n– Added Workout Buddy for workout encouragement (English Only at launch)\n– Revamped Workout UI entirely\n– As part of Workout UI revamp, made custom workouts & racing bits more accessible', 'Ok, with all those items listed, let’s dig into the Workout app and Workout Buddy pieces specifically. Starting off on the Workout App, you’ll see a revamped interface, that shows the various per-sport options in the corners of the UI.', '', 'You’ll see down at the bottom there’s the music option. When you open this, by default there’s an option to autoplay media. However, within that, there’s actually two options. The first is to automatically select a playlist for you, and the second lets you specify exactly what you want.', '', 'Meanwhile, back on the main Workout Screen, if you tap in the upper right corner, you can quickly access structured workouts, goals, pacer, and more.', '', 'Ok, with all that sorted out, it’s time to actually start the workout and look at Workout Buddy. From here, you’ll get audio encouragement from the start. The voices are customizable from a few options, and Apple says these are modeled after the ‘encouraging’ style seen in their Apple Fitness+ instructors. Specifically, two different instructors that you can choose from, though, they are only identified as ‘Voice 1’ and ‘Voice 2’ at present, in the Workout Buddy settings.', 'Still, the female voice is a generative replica of Sam Sancheze, while the male voice is a replica of Jamie Ray. They are both designed to mimic everything from the voice itself, to the various phrases and terms that both those Fitness+ trainers might use during their sessions normally.', 'The entire Workout Buddy feature is then effectively divided up into three core phases:', 'The key thing Apple is trying to add here is ultimately context. Stats at the base level are a dime a dozen in the fitness industry. Instead, they’re trying to pull from all of your existing Fitness data to find nuggets that you might not otherwise know about, or wouldnt’ consider.', 'These can include the following, as examples:', '– “Fastest Mile Yet!”\n– “You’ve climbed 2,000ft in elevation.”\n– “The last split was 8 minutes, 45 seconds”\n–  “So far this week you’ve closed all your workouts.”\n– “You broke your all-time distance record!”\n– “That’s the longest HIIT workout you’ve recorded. Keep up the great work!”\n– “You did it, that was your fastest 5K yet!”', 'As you can see, it’s a bit of a blend of what we’ve seen in terms of typical lap splits, along with ones that are more aware of your general stats. Apple says this will also pull from their training load features they launched last year, as well as all your workout and fitness data, including aspects like distances logged. Note that both the voices and the actual tidbits it says are all generative AI. While Apple has trained the model in terms of prompts and guardrails, it’s ultimately creating these insights on the fly on your watch. As one might guess, these will be positive-focused insights, as opposed to negative ones (as much fun as it might be to have an angry pessimistic coach voice).', 'Workout Buddy is available for the following sport types at launch, and can be disabled for any given sport type as well (for example if you want it just on running but not strength):', '– Outdoor Run\n– Indoor Run\n– Indoor Walk\n– Outdoor Walk\n– Outdoor Ride\n– High Intensity Interval Training\n– Traditional & Functional Strength Training', 'And as noted, it’ll be available in English at launch. Apple hasn’t specified timelines for other languages. It remains to be seen how Apple will balance between useful/encouraging, and “please just shut up and let me die on these final intervals by myself”.', 'Finally, it’s worth noting that Apple says that it’ll start understanding your routines, so when you go to the gym, it’ll automatically understand that, and show the Workout app, with the strength training sport automatically pre-selected, when you arrive at the gym:', '', 'And likewise, if you go out of cellular/WiFi range, your watch will also recommend starting a Backtrack session, so you can get back if you get lost. This whole concept is called Smart Stack Hints.', 'Finally, WatchOS 26 will be available for Apple Watch Series 6 and higher, including Apple Watch Ultra 1, Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen). This means all Apple Watches announced from September 2020, with the exception of Apple Watch SE (1st Gen), which was announced September 2020.', 'Stay tuned for more thoughts and real testing thoughts in the future once these reach public beta, which will typically be in the early to mid-July range.', 'Thanks for reading!', 'Hopefully, you found this post useful.

For example, I commute by bike a log and log most of those rides which is why before WatchOS 11 I always had outdoor cycling on the top of the list.', 'So they gave Strava’s Athlete Intelligence a voice?', 'I’m curious to see if something along the lines of sports metrics a la Garmin’s Training Readiness is coming!\nIt would be really disappointing if Apple doesn’t come up with something new.', 'Please not just a new subscription service with Fitness+…., although I wouldn’t put it past Apple.', 'I watched online.

Even though I rarely use my Ultra for anything fitness related, I hope I can turn that Workout Buddy stuff off.', 'And Apple, where are my Topo maps?', 'But you still cannot create a native custom strength workout (weights reps etc)?', 'So at least in the presentation no TBT navigation in the workout app, no decent topo maps, still huge gaps in trails near me in Germany and France, no Running Power Zones, nothing new or better in the realm of fitness, workouts, wellness outside of uncanny AI voice junk.', 'I mean, Apple is eating the dust of WearOS and Huawei when it comes to fitness, health and wellness features is bad enough, but the biggest software and smartwatch company Apple even falling behind upcoming Huawei and WatchOS and even small Garmin (comparatively small that is), Polar and even Suunto in such kinda easy to implement features (compared to their other stuff) is a big let down.', 'So still no ability to have turn by turn routing within the Apple Watch workout app? It’s probably the one thing that would be so much more streamlined rather than have two apps to toggle between.', 'Not very exciting at all. A whole year to improve fitness chops and further increase the gap with competitors but instead, automated AI stuff no one likes.', 'All of this is looking like a preview of reasons that when the next AW comes out in September, battery life will still be “18 hours” – any bets?', 'This is the worst WatchOS update ever. It’s embarrassing that there’s no GPX import, and turn-by-turn navigation is missing from the workout app. Apple, you can’t be serious!', 'I hope the theme song for Workout Buddy is the same one as the “My Buddy” dolls from the 80s.', 'I’ve used my AW for a few years for workouts, but recently purchased a forerunner 265. I’m both impressed by how intuitive the Garmin interface is, and surprised by how many holes are in the Apple offering. I just didn’t realize how much better it could be until I tried something else. And it looks to me that Apple has nothing in the works to close that gap. Just fluff this year. It’s too bad, because the Garmin has nowhere near the phone integration that Apple does. But when I go out for a run, I take off my apple and put on my garmin. Shame.', 'What is the reason for the poor integration?\nThe EU has set its sights on Apple and finally sees the interaction between iPhone and Apple Watch as critical!', 'Why?\nBecause Apple does not provide interfaces that manufacturers such as Garmin, Polar, Suunto, Samsung…\ncan offer the same functions.', 'I can’t answer messages on the Garmin watch BECAUSE Apple doesn’t want me to, so that their AW has a unique selling point.', 'Politicians have been asleep here for far too long! Fortunately, the EU is finally waking up.', 'Still no HR broadcasting?', 'Ray, I didn’t catch it in the presentation, but can you find out if Workout Buddy requires a live connection to an iPhone? One of the nicest features of a cellular Apple Watch is the ability to leave your phone behind, but given that they are calling this an AI feature, I suspect it has to be tethered to work. Thanks!', 'No, it doesn’t require an internet connection.', 'The only feature which requires an internet connection is the dynamic music bits, if you choose that.', 'Maybe no internet connection, but:', 'Requires an Apple Intelligence–enabled iPhone nearby and Bluetooth headphones with device and Siri language set to English. Apple Intelligence is available in beta on all iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.', 'This was a really, really bad keynote from a sports perspective. With the death of the iSmoothrun app, which was a major reason for my choice of using AW s my sports watch, I am now looking for an alternative.', 'I suspect that the same people who insist of getting a trophy for participating want an always positive coach who tells you how special you are, even if you are just slacking.

The new layout is more streamlined for setting up structured workouts.', ""Additionally, Apple Music can now suggest or automatically select media based on the type of workout, which may save time for users who don't want to choose a playlist manually."", 'Smart Stack now uses improved predictive algorithms and on-device data to surface widgets based on your context and location. Near the gym? It’ll automatically show your workout shortcut—no more digging through menus. I like that kind of thoughtful automation.', 'Notifications also get a boost: they can now auto-adjust volume depending on ambient noise. Plus, Apple added a new wrist-flick gesture that can mute calls, silence timers and alarms, or close the Smart Stack—all without touching the screen.', 'That said, I’m skeptical about this new gesture. Personally, I’d rather just tap the screen to mute a call or stop an alarm. I say that because every morning, when I try to stop my Apple Watch alarm with the pinch gesture, it just frustrates me. Not a great way to start the day. So, while gesture lovers may enjoy the added option, I’m not convinced it improves the experience.', 'Live translation is now available on Apple Watch, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature enables real-time language support right from your wrist—perfect for quick, on-the-go interactions while traveling or navigating multilingual environments. If working properly, it might be practical.', 'The Messages app also sees thoughtful improvements. It now supports context-aware quick actions—like suggesting you share your location during a conversation—streamlining how you respond without digging through menus.', 'And in a long-requested update, the Notes app finally comes to Apple Watch. You can now jot down quick thoughts, grocery items, or reminders, and access synced notes from your iPhone—no need to pull out your phone just to remember what you needed at the store.', 'Thanks to new developer APIs, Dark Noise and other apps can add custom controls directly to the Control Center on Apple Watch. I love this—my sleep hygiene just got an upgrade. No more reaching for my phone screen late at night; I can now start ambient sounds straight from my wrist.', 'While Google leans hard into artificial intelligence, Apple sticks to its strengths: thoughtful design and a refined user experience. And honestly, I’m fine with that. It’s grounded, present, and refreshingly tangible.', 'Maybe Apple avoided the AI race because it’s not their strong suit—or maybe they just know that vague promises don’t impress anyone anymore. After all, we’re all still waiting for a smarter Siri, right? Either way, this update feels deliberate and well-considered—but not particularly exciting.', 'So what’s actually “real” in watchOS 26? Mostly design tweaks. Nothing that jumps out as groundbreaking, but also nothing gimmicky. Just clean, intentional visual polish. Maybe Apple’s saving the bigger updates for the next Apple Watch Series—hopefully.', 'watchOS 26 is available now as a developer preview, with a public beta expected in the coming weeks.

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)', 'In a somewhat overdue move, Apple plans to open up the Apple Watch Control Centre to widgets from third-party developers with watchOS 26.', 'After years of keeping the Control Centre strictly limited to its own toggles and tools, Apple appears ready to loosen its notorious grip with watchOS 26 by introducing third-party widgets.', 'I’ve been covering Apple’s wearable strategy since the first Watch launched, and this shift represents one of the most meaningful functional improvements in years. According to a source for 9to5Mac familiar with Apple’s plans, developers will soon have the ability to create their own widgets for the Control Centre—a change that expands what users can do on their Watch without diving into apps.', 'For those unfamiliar with the current setup, the Apple Watch Control Centre provides quick access to essential functions like Wi-Fi settings, battery levels, and Focus Mode toggles. However, it’s remained stubbornly closed to outside developers since its introduction.', 'Widgets on mobile devices were once associated with Android but have become an increasing focus of Apple in recent years. The company has gradually embraced widgets across iOS and iPadOS, making this watchOS expansion feel somewhat inevitable—if significantly overdue.', 'Beyond simply allowing third-party widgets, sources claim Apple is completely overhauling how users manage the Control Centre of their Watch. The current method of customising this space on the watch itself is frankly cumbersome. The new approach will move these controls to the Watch app on iPhone, letting users easily add, remove, and reorder widgets through a far more intuitive interface.', 'The practical implications are substantial. Imagine a quick-glance weather forecast when you’re deciding whether to grab a brolly, or a one-tap smart home control to lock your doors without fumbling through apps. Fitness enthusiasts could benefit from instant workout activation, while health-conscious users might appreciate hydration trackers with single-tap logging capabilities.', 'Support for third-party widgets is precisely the type of quality-of-life improvement that many Apple Watch users have been requesting. The ability to access critical information and functions without navigating through applications dramatically enhances the user experience on a small-screen device.', 'I’ve previously spoken with several developers who’ve expressed frustration at the limitations of the current watchOS framework. Many have clever ideas that would benefit from Control Centre integration but have been unable to implement them due to Apple’s restrictions. This opening up represents a major shift in Apple’s wearable strategy.', 'The timing feels appropriate, too. The Apple Watch interface has started to feel somewhat dated compared to the company’s other platforms. While complications on watch faces offer some customisation, they’re constrained by space and design limitations that the Control Centre doesn’t share.', 'This change will likely be announced alongside a suite of other updates at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9th. Substantial design refreshes and functional improvements appear to be the focus across Apple’s platforms this year.', 'For Apple Watch enthusiasts, particularly those who’ve invested in the ecosystem of third-party apps, widgets from outside developers can’t come soon enough.
