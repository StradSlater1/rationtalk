Exchange on a one-way street,https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/opinion/exchange-on-a-oneway-street/431208,"['Fight Censorship!', 'Contribute', 'OPINION', 'Suggesting that Zelensky and Putin exchange civilian prisoners is as unrealistic as it is novel. Nobel laureate Muratov’s appeal raises philosophical, political, logistical, legal, and logical questions. However well-intended his plan, the motives are lopsided, the numbers don’t add up, and the onus seems unfairly placed on Ukraine.', 'In a YouTube video broadcast on May 26, Dmitri Muratov addressed the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, asking them to carry out an unprecedented exchange of civilian prisoners. The point of departure in Muratov’s reasoning was the recent successful exchange of prisoners of war: If Russia and Ukraine could swap soldiers, why not civilians, namely anti-war prisoners in Russia in exchange for Ukrainians jailed for collaboration with Russia? Continuing with heartbreaking tales of political prisoners held in Russia who endure torture, medical neglect, and death, Muratov begs for their release “while they are still alive”.', 'The plight of political prisoners in Russia is a humanitarian tragedy, its gravity indeed demands a response. Muratov’s plan however, runs into many obstacles, especially in deciding which prisoners to exchange and what to do with them.', 'Who is a political prisoner in Russia? Legally, they are a heterogeneous group, with charges ranging from espionage to trading of narcotics to extremism and terrorism. The human rights organization OVD-Info has painstakingly documented the faulty logic, chronology, and political motives indicating charges are unwarranted in the cases of over 1600 individuals, and estimates that the true number may be several times as many. Given that it is nearly impossible to identify all the political prisoners in Russia, the only way to achieve a comprehensive release would be through a general amnesty, similar to that declared after the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1990 and in 2024 after the toppling of the Assad regime in Syria. While Muratov’s primary focus is on incarcerated Russians, there are many Ukrainians, according to some estimates thousands of them, as well as people of other nations, in Russian jails and penal colonies.', 'Who will political prisoners be exchanged with? Muratov suggests that Ukraine could offer their citizens convicted for supporting the Russian aggression on their territory. But these pro-Russian Ukrainians are considered to pose a threat to Ukraine, meaning they are criminals, hardly comparable to the victims in captivity in Russia. Ukraine has no reason to let them go.', 'Where will they go? On both sides of this unbalanced equation, there is no sensible destination for these prisoners. They can’t just be let out of the prison doors: the Russian prisoners would be re-arrested on the same or other trumped-up charges, and the Ukrainian collaborators would undermine Ukraine’s security. And they can’t be swapped across the border between the two countries: Russians are not very welcome in Ukraine which shouldn’t have to shoulder the burden of medical care and other support services for Russian citizens, nor does it make sense to deport Ukrainian citizens from their home country. Third-party countries are also unlikely to accept large numbers of Russian and pro-Russian Ukrainians, both of which present potential security risks.', 'Perhaps the biggest flaw in Muratov’s proposal is its failure to take into account Zelensky’s main concern, which is to end the war in a way that preserves Ukraine. From this perspective, the first priority concerning imprisoned citizens would be to get back Ukraine’s prisoners, as well as the thousands of children that have been abducted. Yes, the massive incarceration of political prisoners in Russia is an urgent humanitarian crisis. But it is a problem that Russia created. Ukraine isn’t fighting this war in order to save Russia from its mistakes, they are fighting for their own sovereignty.', '© 2002 - 2025', 'Published by: The Independent Barents Observer AS', 'About us', 'The Barents Observer follows the Code of Ethics of the Norwegian Press and the document Right and Duties of the Editor.

He said:', 'But there is, of course, an indirect effect as the remaining planes will need to fly more sorties, meaning they will be worn out faster, and, most importantly, there is a huge psychological impact.', 'Freuding said Russia had felt safe in its vast territory, which also explained why there was little protection for the aircraft. He added:', 'After this successful operation, this no longer holds true.

Putin's demands to Ukraine underscore a position the West has always suspected: No compromise,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/putins-demands-ukraine-underscore-position-west-always-suspected-no-co-rcna210552,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thought that his spectacular drone strike on Russian air bases would yield a Kremlin compromise, Russia issued its blunt response in black and white: no chance.', 'After waiting for weeks for Moscow to present its ceasefire demands in writing, the West finally got them Monday with a memorandum issued by Russian envoys in Istanbul.', 'Few analysts really believed that Ukraine’s “Spiderweb” plot would gain immediate concessions from a stubborn President Vladimir Putin. And so it was.', 'The memorandum, published in full by the Russian state news agency Tass, was less of a peace plan and more a demand for Ukraine to surrender, defang its military and become a vassal of Moscow.', 'The conditions, which included Ukraine withdrawing from vast swaths of territory and fulfilling a list of Russian-set conditions, put down for the first time on paper what Ukraine and its allies have known since the beginning of this three-year-long war — that Putin and his forces “are going to have to kill their way out of this war,” a Western official with knowledge of the talks told NBC News on Tuesday, predicting “more violence.”', 'The handing over by the Russian delegation of such a maximalist list of demands illustrated that “Russia does not negotiate — except the terms of its opposition’s surrender,” said James Nixey, a London-based consultant specializing on Russia and the former Soviet republics.', 'Putin’s Kremlin is “not fighting a war in Ukraine because of some vague ambition; it’s doing it because it thinks that it is God given right,” he added, and “as extraordinary move from the Ukrainians as this was,” Russia is unlikely to yield until it is “crippled economically and humbled militarily” — neither of which have happened.', 'Under the 12-point plan, Russia would control Crimea, the southern peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014, as well as the eastern territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This is where most of the war has been fought since Russia’s invasion.', 'Russia only controls parts of these areas and so is calling for Ukrainian forces to withdraw — another colossal loss of territory for the country that was invaded three years ago.', 'The document calls for Ukraine to downsize its army, accept “neutral” status between Russia and the West, recognize Russian as an official language, and ban the “glorification or promotion of Nazism.”', 'For many in the West, this is little more than a road map for Ukraine to be swallowed back up by Russia’s sphere of influence, as it was during the Soviet era and then under Kremlin-compliant leaders such as Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.', 'Its publication also suggests that Western intelligence agencies are correct in their belief that Putin is not interested in compromise. The memorandum codifies what Putin has been saying all along — that the “root causes” of the war are NATO’s eastward expansion and fomenting Nazism in Ukraine.', ""The memorandum is “aimed at getting rid of the root causes of this conflict,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Tuesday, adding that Russia was awaiting Ukraine's response. “It would be wrong to expect some immediate decisions and a breakthrough here.”"", 'Others have been less diplomatic.', 'Russia does not want a ""compromise peace on unrealistic conditions invented by someone else,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, wrote on the messaging app Telegram. Rather, he said, the aim was “quick victory and the complete destruction of the neo-Nazi government.”', 'Ukraine and its supporters say Russian claims of Nazism are absurd, particularly when the country is governed by Zelenskyy, who is Jewish. NATO and its backers contend that the alliance has only grown because former Soviet republics, such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, have voted to join in the hope of gaining protection from Russia.', 'Not only is Ukraine unlikely to accept Russia’s absolutist terms, scholars previously interviewed by NBC News believe that Russia knows they won’t. Many see the peace talks as a charade that both sides know will fail, prolonged only to avoid the ire and impatience of President Donald Trump.', ""Ukraine's drone attack was not its only clandestine operation this week."", 'On Tuesday, its security service, the SBU, said it detonated 2,500 pounds of underwater explosives placed on one of the support structures of the Crimean Bridge, a road and rail link the Kremlin uses to transport military equipment.', ""The supports were “severely damaged” without injuries, the SBU said, sharing a video of what it said was the detonation and claiming the structure was in an “emergency condition.” The bridge's operator said it was closed from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. (9 p.m. and midnight ET), without saying why, Reuters reported."", 'Unlike Ukraine’s attacks on military targets, Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian civilians. On Tuesday, it “brutally attacked” the embattled city of Sumy, Zelenskyy said, killing at least three people and injuring “many” more.', 'With both sides still diametrically opposed, Trump’s next move could prove pivotal.', 'Having once promised to end the war in 24 hours, he has become so frustrated with the intractable reality that he has threatened to walk away.', 'There are hopes of another Russian-American prisoner swap and even a meeting between the two presidents. And when the memorandum inevitably comes across Trump’s desk, and he is asked about it during one of his question-and-answer sessions in the Oval Office, the president could react in several different ways, according to Nixey, the Russia expert in London.', '“Either he will say, ‘Yes, but look at what the Ukrainians have done to Russia, so this memorandum is unsurprising,” Nixey said. “Or he will say, ‘Putin is not playing ball. This hasn’t turned out like I thought it would. I’m washing my hands of the whole thing.”', 'Keir Simmons reported from Dubai and Alexander Smith from London.', 'Keir Simmons is chief international correspondent for NBC News, based in Dubai.', 'Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhTekprZW5selIydERjVkJVVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZQllvd1RxUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

In their own, so-called, special operation, Ukrainians hit the underwater support structure of the Kerch bridge. The estimated 1,100 kilogram explosion detonated around 10 meters deep, making the damage more difficult to assess and repair.', 'Notably, Ukraine announced the strike by releasing footage taken from a Russian security camera, showing how deeply infiltrated Ukrainian intelligence services are in Russian networks.', 'To conduct the strike, Ukrainians used a new variant of underwater naval drone, the Toloka 1,000 or the Toloka 400. These new underwater drones, upgrades of the Toloka 150, can deliver between half a ton and 5 tons of explosives at a range of 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers, respectively. The drones can operate at a depth of up to 40 meters.
