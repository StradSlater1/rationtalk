Wait, what?  While a hot shower might feel comforting, when it comes to health perks, a cold shower benefits your body in ways that go far beyond feeling refreshed. Swapping warm water for cold even just twice a week can have a tremendous positive impact on your wellbeing, especially when it comes to improving your heart health. Keep reading for six proven benefits of reducing the water temperature in your shower.', 'Exposure to cold temperatures, whether it’s a chilly shower or trendy ice bath, can improve your circulation to ease strain on your heart, reduce inflammation and even give your mental health a boost. Here’s what you can enjoy if you turn down the dial the next time you hop in the shower:', '', 'We all know about the importance of warding off heart disease, stroke and other ailments, but many of us don’t know where to begin to give our hearts the TLC it needs. Luckily, simply switching to cold water in your normal shower routine may deliver the benefits you’re after.', '“Cold showers trigger vasoconstriction followed by rebound vasodilation,” says Kavin Mistry, MD, academic neuroradiologist and author of Primal Health Design. What that means is that your blood vessels constrict then dilate—almost like exercise for your circulatory system. “This ‘vascular workout’ enhances blood flow, strengthens vessel walls and supports overall cardiovascular flexibility.”', 'You’ve likely heard of the importance of heart rate variability or HRV for our heart health, and cold showers can help our HRV function like it should.', '“Cold exposure stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to improvements in HRV—a key marker of cardiovascular health and stress recovery,” says Dr. Mistry referencing research in the Journal of Thermal Biology.', 'Simply put, cold showers give our heart the training to function well. “Cold showers train the cardiovascular system to become more adaptive, agile and resilient—traits associated with long-term heart health,” says Dr. Mistry. ', 'It’s no secret that our metabolism slows over time (check out the warning signs here), triggering everything from weight gain to a stubborn “menopause belly”. If you’ve been trying to kick your metabolism into high gear, the unexpected shock of a cold water shower might be the extra boost your body needs.', '“Cold showers stimulate brown adipose tissue (BAT), a metabolically-active [beneficial] fat that burns calories to generate heat,” explains Dr. Mistry, referencing research published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. “This process, known as non-shivering thermogenesis, enhances insulin sensitivity and improves the body’s ability to burn energy more efficiently.”', 'You may recognize the perfect combo of being in a good mood and having mental clarity? It feels amazing, but for most of us, it doesn’t happen very frequently. Enter the rejuvenating benefits of a cold shower. ', '“Cold exposure spikes levels of norepinephrine and dopamine, two powerful neurotransmitters that support focus, motivation and mood,” says Dr. Mistry,  referencing research published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. “Studies have demonstrated that cold immersion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, resulting in sustained feelings of wellbeing and alertness.” ', 'How often were you told growing up that spending too much time out in the rain or cold would increase your likelihood of catching a cold? If the answer is a ton, you’re not alone. The idea that exposure to cold would harm our immune system instead of helping it is widely accepted, but research demonstrates, it may not be fully true. ', '“Cold exposure acts as a mild stressor, activating the immune system. In a Dutch study, daily cold showers were found to significantly reduce sick days and improve perceived health in over 3,000 participants,” says Dr. Mistry referencing PLOS ONE research. ', 'You’ve likely heard messaging about the importance of developing strong muscles for bone health, joint health and steady blood sugar. But if you’ve spent any time working on developing those muscles, you’ve likely also experienced the post-workout muscle pain that comes with it. It turns out cold showers could be helpful in your recovery process. ', '“Cold water immersion was superior to other recovery methods for alleviating muscle soreness, and comparable to other methods for recovering muscular power and flexibility,” says Dr. Mistry referencing research published in Sports Medicine.

How often you take cold showers is up to you, but Dr. Mistry says making them part of your daily routine can boost your energy and strengthen your heart. Dr. Mistry also provided a cold-showering guide for you to dive in: ', 'Transition from warm to cold: Begin with your normal warm shower. In the last 30 seconds, turn the water cold. Focus on breathing slowly through your nose, which calms your nervous system and improves your tolerance to cold over time.', 'Progress gradually: Increase your cold exposure by 15 seconds every few days. The goal is to work up to one to two minutes of cold water at the end of your shower.', 'Listen to your body: If you feel dizzy, short of breath or panicked, return to warm water. The goal is adaptation, not discomfort.', 'Stay consistent: Even just 60 seconds of a cold shower daily can produce benefits over time. You do not need to immerse yourself in ice water or mimic professional athletes to see results.', 'Getting used to cold showers takes time, but once you do, you’ll likely find that you look forward to them. The endorphin rush and sense of wellbeing after cold exposure are addicting, and there’s no quicker way to experience quite so many health benefits.', 'More ways to keep your heart healthy:', 'Heart Disease Treatment at Home: Doctor-Approved Ways to Protect Your Heart', 'Broken Heart Syndrome Symptoms Can Mimic a Heart Attack—What You Need to Know to Stay Safe', 'Elvis Presley’s Heart Disease: What Led to His Fatal Heart Attack at Just 42', '', 'Conversation', ""All comments are subject to our Community Guidelines.

Ice Baths and Saunas: Are the Latest Health Trends Bad for Your Lungs?,https://www.lung.org/blog/sauna-cold-plunges-health-impacts,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'by Editorial Staff | May 29, 2025', 'Though there are many wellness trends, saunas and cold plunges are particularly popular. By alternating between these two extreme heat-related therapies, many people hope to improve circulation, reduce inflammation and enhance mental clarity, among other things. But this rapid change in temperature is not easy on your body and has some very serious risks. This is especially true for anyone who is pregnant or has chronic heart disease or chronic lung disease. Switching between the heat of a sauna and cold, icy water can raise your blood pressure or cause you to go into shock, which is why you should always consult your healthcare provider before adding cold plunges and saunas to your routine. So, when are these trends beneficial and when are they dangerous?', 'Saunas offer a controlled environment where users can be exposed to high temperatures, normally 150 degrees F or higher and between 20% and 40% humidity. Stepping into a hot sauna causes your body’s blood vessels to dilate, increasing circulation and delivering more blood to your muscles and tissues.\u202fThis can relax tight muscles, but it also increases sweating which can aid in detoxification.', 'Saunas are suggested for some people to temporarily relieve inflammation of the respiratory system. The warm humid environment can help loosen chronic mucus, making it easier to expel from the airways. Additionally, the increased circulation can ease breathing, which some have suggested is particularly helpful for anyone with chronic lung disease, like COPD.', 'Though little research supports the advantages, experts agree that saunas are not right for everyone. Children, people who are pregnant, people with high blood pressure, or with preexisting heart conditions can experience negative health effects. For patients with lung disease, the dry air may make breathing in more difficult and increase the likelihood of a flare up, also called an exacerbation. Individuals who are sick with a respiratory infection such as a cold can potentially worsen their illness by dehydrating their airways. Anyone who has been drinking alcohol should avoid saunas because they increase the risk of dehydration, hypotension, arrhythmia and even death. Furthermore, saunas’ high temperatures can lead to dizziness and nausea for some people, and, if caused by dehydration, can exacerbate chronic illnesses.', 'However, if you are not in a high-risk group, moderate use of saunas can be safe and may offer some benefits that are complementary to traditional medicine. But you should always consult your healthcare provider so that you can discuss precautions to be taken. First time users should ease into it, spending no more than 5 to 10 minutes in the heat. No one should spend more than 20 minutes at a time in a sauna. Though it can be tempting to use a sauna to detoxify from sickness, it is strongly discouraged. Most importantly, heat therapy can dehydrate the body quickly, so hydration is crucial.', 'Cold plunges, or ice baths, are used by many athletes to reduce swelling and speed up muscle recovery. The shock of cold-water immersion causes blood vessels to constrict, which in turn flushes out toxins and reduces inflammation. Additionally, it is thought to stimulate the immune system, improve circulation and stimulate the vagus nerve which helps us breathe more freely.', 'Though some benefits for athletes may occur, plunging into cold water can be extremely dangerous. Cold shock can trigger rapid, uncontrolled breathing or hyperventilation, especially in individuals living with chronic lung disease, which can lead to dizziness or fainting. If this happens unsupervised, the person is at risk of drowning. Additionally, the cold water which causes your blood vessels to constrict leads to an increase in blood pressure and forces the heart to work harder. For this reason, people with an existing heart condition are particularly vulnerable to adverse side-effects, so most healthcare providers advise against cold plunges. Hypothermia and frostbite are also always a risk.', 'Further danger lies in combining therapies, though this is also where some athletes say the benefits lie. Some people believe that contrast therapy between heat and cold creates a powerful vascular workout, which can strengthen your cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation and improve blood flow regulation over time.\u202fBut in the short term, putting this immense strain on the body can have serious consequences. This is particularly true for children, older adults, anyone who is pregnant or is living with chronic heart or lung diseases.', ""As with any new therapy, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider before using saunas or cold plunges. They can provide guidance based on your specific health needs and conditions and help you weigh the potential benefits and risks.

Are ice baths good for you? The benefits and risks of a cold plunge.,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ice-baths-good-benefits-risks-133044237.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Soothing sore muscles. Improving mood and sleep. Accelerating weight loss. Vagus nerve stimulation. Wellness enthusiasts, athletes, and maybe even your gym buddy are regularly praising ice baths for a wide range of benefits.', 'And today’s fans of cryotherapy—the use of cold for therapeutic purposes—aren’t on to anything new. Ancient Egyptians and Hippocrates all have touted the healing benefits of cold water. “This has been around for a really long time,” says Dr. Georgine Nanos, a board-certified family physician and owner of Kind Health Group, in an interview with Popular Science.', 'But was Hippocrates onto something? Research shows that the effectiveness of ice baths depends on their intended purpose.', 'An ice bath or cold plunge typically involves immersing yourself in frigid water—either in a tub filled with ice or a naturally cold body of water. Even a cold shower can offer similar effects.', 'Especially for beginners, moderation is key, Nanos says. She recommends starting with water around 55 degrees to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, staying in for just 30 seconds, and then gradually increasing the duration to one to two minutes. Over a few weeks, and depending on how you feel, you can work up to three to five minutes. Benefits tend to plateau beyond five to six minutes, she points out.', 'Getting colder is possible, but extra caution is required. Nanos advises that anyone immersing themselves in water colder than 45 degrees should be supervised. Cold plunges, she notes, aren’t for everyone, especially those with heart conditions, high blood pressure, or a history of arrhythmias or heart attacks.', 'An ice bath “can worsen an arrhythmia, because when you’re in the cold, it can increase oxidative stress and suppress short-term immune responses, and that can cause gasping and hyperventilation and acute cardiac strain,” Nanos explains.', 'From a scientific standpoint, cold water exposure triggers a series of internal changes in our body. It activates the sympathetic nervous system and releases a cascade of hormones called catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine, according to Nanos. “Those are like our feel-good hormones,” she says, and their release can improve your mood and alertness.', 'When you plunge into cold water, your blood vessels also narrow—a process called vasoconstriction—to preserve heat, she says. When you come out, your vessels widen again—vasodilation—to bring your body temperature back to normal. Those changes could improve circulation, Nanos says.', 'What’s more, cold exposure causes shivering, which is your body trying to generate heat. The theory is that shivering could temporarily raise your metabolism, which some believe could help with losing weight, she says. “That’s the scientific idea, but the evidence for that is not that great,” Nanos explains.', 'So, how do those physiological changes actually help us? Healthcare providers and experts have mostly relied on small clinical studies or observational data to support the potential health benefits of cold-water immersion, Nanos says. But systematic reviews of the research are beginning to shed light on the popular therapy, though everybody notes more study of the impacts is required..', 'A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of cold-water immersion, for example, examined the effects of cold-water immersion across 11 studies involving 3,177 participants. The interventions used either baths or showers with water between 45 degrees to 59 degrees Fahrenheit, lasting anywhere between 30 seconds and two hours.', 'The review found no immediate reduction in stress following cold-water immersion, but participants did report relief 12 hours later. In addition, there were improvements in sleep quality and overall quality of life, although no significant changes in mood were observed.', 'A separate 2023 meta-analysis of 20 studies homed in on how well ice baths help athletes reduce muscle soreness, fatigue, and damage after intense exercise. Researchers found that an ice plunge can help reduce muscle soreness and fatigue immediately after exercise.', 'But they also found that time in frigid water could reduce so-called explosive performance—such as the ability to jump high—immediately after getting out of cold water.', 'And, cautions Nanos, timing seems to matter when it comes to a post-workout ice bath. A 2024 review of eight studies found that cold-water bathing after resistance training could actually reduce muscle growth—a big downside for those seeking to bulk up.', '“If you do it too soon, you’re blunting muscle protein synthesis,” Nanos says. It’s recommended to wait four to six hours after strength training to do a cold plunge—or even only stepping into frigid water on rest or cardio days, she said.', 'So, bottom line, if you enjoy an ice bath and experience benefits, go for it. “And if it makes you miserable, stop,” Nanos advises . “Some people just really have a strong aversion to being that cold and their bodies don’t adapt, and they don’t feel good or they panic. If you find that your body can’t regulate, even after starting slowly, it’s just not for you.”', 'However, if the cold water calls to you, dive in.', 'This story is part of Popular Science’s Ask Us Anything series, where we answer your most outlandish, mind-burning questions, from the ordinary to the off-the-wall.

A new study from the University of Ottawa sheds light on how repeated cold exposure can toughen up your cells and potentially set the stage for longer, healthier lives.', '', 'Researchers at the Human and Environmental Physiology Research Lab (HEPRU) at uOttawa investigated the effects of daily cold plunges on cellular health. They found that just 7 days of 1-hour cold water immersions at 14°C (57.2°F) improved the body’s ability to handle stress at the cellular level, by boosting two key systems: autophagy (the cell’s recycling system) and apoptosis (the controlled removal of damaged cells).', 'Autophagy is like spring cleaning for your cells, clearing out old and damaged parts to keep things running smoothly. Initially, high-intensity cold stress disrupted this process. But after a week of consistent exposure, autophagy bounced back stronger than before. This improvement means cells are better equipped to manage stress and reduce damage over time.', '“Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism,” says Professor Glen Kenny, the study’s senior author.', 'Apoptosis also showed more balanced activity after the acclimation period. This controlled cell death process removes cells that are beyond repair, preventing them from becoming a problem later.', 'The real excitement comes from what these cellular changes could mean for your overall health. Improved autophagy and apoptosis are linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases and even slower cellular aging.', '“Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level,” says Kelli King, the study’s first author. “It’s like a tune-up for your body’s microscopic machinery.”', 'While the participants were young, healthy males, and more research is needed to see if the same effects apply to other groups, these findings are a promising first step in understanding how cold exposure could contribute to long-term health.', 'So, does this mean you should jump into a freezing lake every day?
