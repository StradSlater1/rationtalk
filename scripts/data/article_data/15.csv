It has long argued that the US, which is not party to the Rome Statute, lies outside the ICC’s jurisdiction.', 'Another country that is not a member of the Rome Statute is Israel, which has used similar arguments to reject the ICC’s power over its actions in Palestine.', 'The second pair of judges named in Thursday’s sanctions — Alapini Gansou and Hohler — were sanctioned for their actions against Israeli leaders, according to the US State Department.', 'The US is Israel’s oldest ally, having been the first to recognise the country in 1948. It has since offered Israel strong support, including for its ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed an estimated 54,607 Palestinians so far.', 'Experts at the United Nations and human rights organisations have compared Israel’s military campaign in Gaza to a genocide, as reports continue to emerge of alleged human rights abuses.', 'In November 2024, those accusations spurred the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who have both been accused of war crimes in Gaza, including intentional attacks on civilians.', 'Alapini Gansou and Hohler reportedly took part in those proceedings.', 'This is not the first time that the US has issued restrictions against an ICC official since Trump returned to office for a second term on January 20.', 'Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broad executive order threatening anyone who participates in ICC investigations with sanctions. Critics warned that such sweeping language could pervert the course of justice, for example by dissuading witnesses from coming forward with evidence.', 'But Trump argued that the recent arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant necessitated such measures.', 'He also claimed that the US and Israel were “thriving democracies” that “strictly adhere to the laws of war” and that the ICC’s investigations threatened military members with “harassment, abuse and possible arrest”.', '“This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government and our allies, including Israel,” the executive order said.', 'Under that order, the US sanctioned ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, who had petitioned the court for the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. That, in turn, slowed the investigation into Israel’s actions in Gaza, and Khan later stepped away from his role amid allegations of sexual misconduct.', 'But Trump has a history of opposing the ICC, stretching back to his first term. In 2019, for instance, Trump announced his administration would deny or yank visas for ICC officials involved in investigating US troops in Afghanistan.', 'Then, in 2020, he sanctioned ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and a court official named Phakiso Mochochoko for their involvement in the investigation. Those actions were later overturned under President Joe Biden.', 'Critics, however, warn that Trump’s actions could have dire consequences over the long term for the ICC, which relies on its member countries to execute orders like arrest warrants. The court itself has called for an end to the threats.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXBXVWM0VXpWTU5GaEpNeloyVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdhSmFaYkZLZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

The US is not only targeting specific cases, it is threatening the Court’s entire docket.', '6 June 2025. Independent judges are being punished for simply carrying out their official duties - authorising independent investigations and issuing arrest warrants in the Palestine and Afghanistan situations. They ruled on matters involving alleged international crimes committed by nationals of the United States and Israel. These actions fall squarely within the ICC’s mandate.', 'Sanctioning ICC judges flips international justice on its head, and sends a chilling message: those who pursue accountability for mass atrocities risk punishment while those allegedly responsible for international crimes are protected. This is devastating not only for ICC staff and civil society supporting the Court, but especially for victims and affected communities in Palestine, Afghanistan, and beyond, who look to the Court for hope. These sanctions crush that hope.', 'These types of sanctions, enforced through Trump’s Executive Order and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), were originally designed to disrupt terrorist networks and human rights abusers - not to target international justice institutions. Directing them against ICC officials represents a dangerous misuse of executive power. The sanctions are intended not to protect national security, but to shield powerful allies like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and send a warning to others: do not cooperate with the Court. And that’s precisely the intention - Trump’s ICC sanctions support impunity, not accountability.', 'The four women judges being sanctioned are Judge Solomy Balungi Bossa (Uganda), Judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza (Peru), Judge Reine Alapini-Gansou (Benin), and Judge Beti Hohler (Slovenia). While these sanctions specifically cite the Palestine and Afghanistan situations, their consequences are far broader. All four judges have worked on proceedings in several other ICC situations, including Belarus/Lithuania, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Mali, Myanmar/Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sudan, Uganda, and Venezuela.', 'Our organisations welcome the strong condemnation of the sanctions by the Netherlands, as well as Slovenia’s prompt proposal to immediately activate the EU Blocking Statute to protect EU citizens and international justice institutions from such coercive measures.', 'Our organisations call on:\n All 125 ICC States Parties to denounce the sanctions publicly and unequivocally, and reaffirm their commitment to the Rome Statute;\n The European Union to honour its unequivocal commitment to protect the ICC’s independence and President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent affirmation that ""Europe will always stand for justice and the respect of international law"" by issuing a public statement of condemnation, making this a central issue in ongoing negotiations with the United States, and immediately activating and expanding the EU Blocking Statute, as urged by Slovenia, to shield ICC officials and institutions from politically motivated attacks;\n Governments worldwide to coordinate strong legal and diplomatic pushback including reciprocal measures and refusal to enforce politically motivated sanctions;\n The ICC Office of the Prosecutor to investigate any individual for potential “offences against the administration of justice” under Article 70(1)(e) of the Rome Statute, which criminalises retaliation against officials of the Court for the official duties they perform;\n The US Congress to oppose this dangerous distortion of sanctions law and restore support for international justice;\n Civil society organisations, bar associations, and others to speak out urgently defending judicial independence, rejecting the misuse of sanctions to obstruct justice, and exposing their chilling effect on accountability efforts.', 'When judges are punished for doing their job, justice everywhere is at risk. When judges and justice are attacked at the ICC, the Court of last resort responsible for determining accountability for the world’s worst crimes, it sends a chilling message across the globe. This kind of assault has a ripple effect, making judicial bodies everywhere feel vulnerable. This moment demands solidarity and courage from the international community, requiring it to unequivocally speak out against these attacks on the rule of law. If we allow judges to be sanctioned for applying the law, the very foundations of justice, accountability, and the rights of victims are at risk.', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXBXVWM0VXpWTU5GaEpNeloyVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdhSmFaYkZLZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

During the first Trump administration in 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and one of her top aides over the court’s work on Afghanistan.', 'The measures also follow a January vote at the U.S. House of Representatives to punish the ICC in protest over its Netanyahu arrest warrant. The move underscored strong support among Trump’s fellow Republicans for Israel’s government.', 'DIFFICULT TIME FOR ICC', 'The measures triggered uproar among human-rights advocates.

Security Council. The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members. It has high-profile war crimes investigations under way into the Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia’s war in Ukraine as well as in Sudan, Myanmar, the Philippines, Venezuela and Afghanistan.
