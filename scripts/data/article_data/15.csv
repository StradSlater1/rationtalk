It is expected that SMR construction contracts, which will invest billions of pounds (trillions of won), and investment decisions in Sizewell C, a large nuclear power plant, will be made.', ""Sizewell C is a large-scale nuclear power plant located in Suffolk, and although the development plan was implemented in 2010, it has not progressed virtually for as many as 15 years. In this government spending review, the government will reconfirm its intention to invest and allocate public finances. Details will be released in advance, but final approval is expected to come at a summit between British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled for 8-10 next month. This is because France's state-owned company, the French Electric Power Corporation (EDF), owns a stake in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant."", 'In addition to Sizewell C, the UK is also working on a new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset.

In other words, Prime Minister Starmer did not have many options other than nuclear power plants.', ""Five nuclear power plants currently cover 15% of Britain's energy needs, but four of them will be shut down sequentially by 2030. As the Hinckley Point C project was six years behind schedule, the budget increased 2.5 times from 18 billion pounds (about 33.12 trillion won) to 46 billion pounds (about 84.63 trillion won).

Are their lives expendable in his reckoning? Why does he ignore what they suffered?', 'His Great White Hope of Torness is delusional. The plant’s operator, EDF Energy, admitted that three cracks had been found in the graphite core of one of the station’s reactors. According to EDF, the cracks were “entirely expected” and would not “on their own” affect the safe operation of the power station.

Even the new Heathrow runway might not be necessary if instead we used our own resources to make Prestwick suitable for exporting our salmon and whisky! They could even stop belatedly having to copy Scottish actions on poverty, like restoring the Winter Fuel Payment, or free school meals for children living in poverty.', 'Of course, Scotland would have to have all the hassle of working out what to charge Westminster for the 40% of the renewable electricity that we send over the Border, and for a share of our oil and gas that they need, and suitable recompense for the desecration of our countryside and seabed for new pylons and subsea cables to transport more of our renewable energy to Yorkshire and other parts of England. I am sure a Scottish Government would manage to cope with all this workload, and Farage and others in England would have so much more peace of mind that not a penny of their taxes was subsidising Scotland.', 'What’s not to like?
