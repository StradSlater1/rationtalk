iPadOS 26 makes Apple's tablets more like Macs,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-makes-apples-tablets-more-like-macs-174904597.html,"[""iPadOS 26 is coming to supercharge your tablet's productivity. At WWDC 2025, Apple previewed what it called the iPad’s biggest software update yet. You can finally resize app windows dynamically. Meanwhile, the menu bar brings drop-downs for more organized controls. And it's all wrapped in Apple's new Liquid Glass redesign. All in all, iPad users craving a more Mac-like experience have plenty to chew on here."", 'The rumors about a Mac-like multitasking overhaul came to fruition. The new windowing system lets you ""seamlessly close, minimize, resize or tile [your] windows."" The resizing options aren\'t limited like in the previous version of Stage Manager. You can make them any size by dragging a handle on the lower right. Or, flick to tile all your windows toward the screen edges. (Long-pressing reveals more tiling options.) And when you reopen the app, your windows will return to their last position.', ""Exposé also makes its way over from Apple's desktop. It shows your open windows in a tiled array, making it easier to jump between them. And if any of those apps have long-running tasks (like exports), they'll continue in the background. (They'll show up as live activities.)"", 'The menu bar, a Mac mainstay from the get-go, arrives on the iPad. As on the Mac, the active app includes familiar menu entries like File, Edit, View, Window, Format, Arrange and Help. When using touch controls, you can use the menu bar by swiping down from the top. Or, click with your cursor when using a trackpad or mouse.', 'The Preview app also arrives in iPadOS 26, allowing you to view and edit PDFs. Using the Apple Pencil or touch, you can mark up your documents. It also includes AutoFill, letting you fill out PDF forms without third-party software.', ""The Files app gets an update to keep pace with the iPad's new productivity chops. It has an updated List view that displays more information about your documents. It includes resizable columns and collapsible folders. You can also choose default apps for specific file types. (For example, edit photos with Photoshop, Darkroom or Pixelmator.) Dragging folders to the dock, like on macOS, is a new option."", 'The big productivity overhaul follows years of subtler nudges in that direction. When it arrived 15 years ago, the iPad worked with physical keyboards, but only for typing. Trackpad support didn\'t come until 10 years later. Later, iPadOS 15 added a context menu for window management. And the first Stage Manager brought a more mature multitasking environment. But each of those moves was only incremental. Power users begging Apple for something more ""Pro"" were left wanting. The new iPadOS 19 features look like a giant leap by comparison.', ""The productivity updates won't be limited to iPad Pro and Air. The entry-level model and iPad mini get them, too."", 'iPadOS 26 is wrapped in the Liquid Glass redesign coming to all of Apple’s new software at WWDC 2025. You’ll see translucent effects and rounder icons to match device corners. It’s all inspired by the software for Apple’s mixed reality headset.', 'Of course, the software’s naming scheme is also new. Apple unified its upcoming software by giving them all the “26” number. Before, the version ticked up once each year. But since the company’s platforms were on different numbers, it could confuse some. So, from now on, all Apple software will carry the name of the upcoming year. (Although the update arrives this fall, it will be the de facto software for the bulk of 2026.) Pour one out for the “iPadOS 19” that will never be.', ""There are also plenty of smaller updates. iPadOS 26 also includes Apple's new dedicated Games app. The Phone app arrives, letting you make and receive calls from your tablet. (They were previously folded into the FaceTime app.) There's an audio input selector, letting you choose different microphones for each app. And the new Apple Intelligence features, including live translation, are here too."", 'The first iPadOS 26 developer beta is now available. Public betas will follow in July. The software’s final version will land this fall, likely in or around September.', ""Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference kicked off yesterday, June 9.

But there's one huge question"", 'Apple has announced that iPadOS 26 will introduce much more flexible window-based multitasking to its tablet lineup. But there’s one huge question; why didn’t it happen before?', 'Stage Manager was introduced late in iPadOS 16 as well as macOS Ventura in 2022 – but it didn’t work well on smaller displays and just wasn’t that good at actually doing the thing it was supposed to. It’s still there “for those who want to group their windows into distinct stages.”', 'Apple previously tried other multitasking gestures for Slide Over and Split View and while these have persisted, they were never made the most of.', 'While the iPad is really good for so many things, it’s been held back by its software for many years now. Could this finally be solved?', 'I guess the problem is that someone at Apple – or many people – don’t want the iPad to ape the Mac’s operating system. But the problem is that most people are pretty used to windows as a way of working since it’s been around for most of the last 50 years. And some of the actions – and now gestures – we’ve seen from the Mac and iPad over the last year or two to handle windows. Well, they date back to 2009’s Windows 7 and its Aero Snap feature.', 'The iPad’s more freeform resize windows options – previously in Stage Manager – are similar to the Vision Pro. I’m a big fan of Apple’s headset, even if it’s not really a consumer device. And one of the best things about it is the way you can resize windows.', 'You can now put windows where you want and open more, too. You can flick windows to either side of the screen (that’s properly good) and tile windows, too. And you can use Mac-like window controls to close or minimise windows too. Apps also re-open with the same size windows you had before. Exposé has also come across from macOS – you can quickly see all your open windows spread out, helping you switch between them', 'And, perhaps most interestingly, there’s now a new menu bar, too., where you can access an app’s commands. Just flick down from the top or move your cursor to the top of the screen if you’re mousing around. And the menu bar can be customised too.', 'Hopefully the new look and feel can finally draw a line under what has been a rather messy time for multitasking on the iPad. It’s a hugely capable device, sure. And it’s not a Mac, sure. But it still needs to have the features that everyday users expect. Apple seems to have finally admitted that and it’s also brought the Preview app across from the Mac, too.', 'But there is another request – power up the Files app so it’s a lot more like the Mac’s Finder or Windows File Explorer. OK, so it does have some new features this time around like being able to drag files to apps in the dock. But we need more. Unfortunately, most of us also need to shunt stacks of files around every day.', ""Dan is Editor-in-chief of Stuff, working across the magazine and the Stuff.tv website.

Apple launches iPadOS 26 with a new look and way better multitasking,https://www.theverge.com/apple/679420/apple-ipados-wwdc-2025,"['Is the iPad more Mac, or more iPhone? This year, the answer is Mac.', '', 'The iPad is getting a big refresh this year: Apple just announced the new version of iPadOS, its tablet operating system, at WWDC. (Apple dropped its press releases before they were technically announced in the virtual event.) The flagship feature is a new windowing system for multitasking across apps, but there’s also a new Files app, more Apple Intelligence features, and a Mac-like Preview app for looking at and editing PDFs.', 'As usual, the new iPadOS has a lot in common with the new iOS, including the new Vision Pro-inspired visual language called “Liquid Glass.” The updated name also follows Apple’s overall scheme, switching from version numbers to years. The iPad tends to differ in its approach to multitasking, how you move between apps, and around the operating system. With iPadOS 26, that difference is more stark than ever: Apple says it will let you “fluidly resize app windows” and place windows anywhere you want on the screen. The windowing system can be used inside of Stage Manager, too, and works across displays. Stage Manager has not always been the most intuitive of iPad software, but this looks like a solid next step toward proper multitasking.', 'The iPad has always straddled the Mac and iPhone, and there are arguments that it should be more like one or the other rather than squarely in the middle. The rumors ahead of this year’s WWDC seemed to suggest a more Mac-centric take, and that is clearly the case. The iPad now has a menu bar that you can access by swiping down from the top of the display, which will show various controls for the app you’re looking at.', 'There’s also a new Preview app, which Apple says is both for viewing and for marking up PDFs (it supports the Apple Pencil, of course), and you can see a more Mac-style list view in the Files app as well. Developers can even make their apps run more powerfully in the background, and they’ll show up in Live Activities to let you know what’s going on.', 'In addition to all the power-user stuff, the iPad is now getting the Journal app that was previously only for the iPhone, and access to the Apple Games hub for all of Apple’s gaming products. The iPad also has a specific new Game Overlay feature that lets you update settings and chat with friends without switching apps.', 'The new OS is available for developers starting today.

Apple’s walled garden is the iPad’s biggest roadblock to becoming a Mac,https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/apples-walled-garden-is-the-ipads-biggest-roadblock-to-becoming-a-mac-223014619.html,"[""iPadOS 26 makes Apple's tablet much more like macOS. Better windowing? Check. The menu bar? Yup. There's even a more fine-tuned Files app, along with document editing in Preview. It's as if Apple took a checklist of longtime power-user requests and fulfilled them all. It's enough that the App Store's walled garden could be the last remaining reason to stick with your Mac."", ""For me, the iPad's productivity changes were the most intriguing part of Apple's WWDC 2025 keynote. Years ago, when Apple first made iPadOS more work-friendly, I tried to replace my MacBook with the iPad Pro. After reviewing several Microsoft Surfaces, I wanted an Apple equivalent, dammit. So, despite the iPad's obvious limits, I gave it a shot."", ""For most things I did, it was… fine. But there were always tasks that slowed me down. Apple's Split View, which places two apps side by side, was solid. Stage Manager added even more windowing nuance. But it still wasn't the same as arranging windows manually. All I had to do was hop back on a Mac, and things became clear: The iPad was nowhere near ready for my workflow. I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole."", ""The changes in iPadOS 26 will finally bring the tablet close to something that could replace a Mac. For many, I suspect it will be more than enough. You can place windows anywhere and resize them fluidly. The menu bar will make it easier to access the finer controls of apps. You can tile windows and see them all in a grid with Exposé. The Files app catches up with the Mac's Finder. The new Preview app should make document editing a breeze. And you can easily return to full-screen iPad simplicity at any time."", ""That raises the question: Where does iPadOS still fall short of macOS? It's the lock-in, stupid."", 'The Mac grew up in an era when you could install apps from anywhere. First, it was discs. Then, the internet. Sure, Apple made changes in the last decade that make macOS a bit more restricted. System Integrity Protection (SIP) comes to mind. Gatekeeper, too. However, on the whole, it remains a relatively open environment. Getting your apps from anywhere often means a broader selection, faster updates and fewer restrictions.', 'The iPad, on the other hand, evolved from the iPhone. (Those old enough may recall the ""It\'s just a big iPod touch"" commentary mocking the first model.) The App Store has always been the only official way to install apps on the iPad (EU exceptions notwithstanding). That remains so in iPadOS 26.', 'The tablet software also prevents apps from overriding security and privacy restrictions. While that may not sound like a good idea, it can be a killer feature for trusted Mac apps.', 'For example, Keyboard Maestro on macOS can automate almost anything you can do with a keyboard and mouse. BetterTouchTool also offers a (nearly) endless list of customizations, including window controls. (My favorite is changing the yellow ""traffic light"" button so that it hides apps instead of minimizing them.) Karabiner-Elements lets you remap any key. A clipboard manager can, with a single keystroke, display everything you\'ve copied.', ""Then there are Mac apps that let you use alternatives to Apple's versions. Third-party launchers like Raycast and Alfred are like Spotlight on steroids. (Their extension libraries are so vast, they have their own storefronts.) Apps like Rectangle and Moom give you alternatives to Apple's window management. Many Mac apps offer more flexible text replacement than Apple's built-in solution."", ""What iPadOS 26 does is draw a line between two types of power users. Like before, Mac power users will use some combination of the above examples. Meanwhile, a new class of iPad power users will enjoy the tablet's desktop capabilities. But the latter will still be limited to Apple's version of, well, everything. The power is much stronger now; openness, however, isn't."", ""For that reason alone, I'll likely remain a Mac-first guy for the foreseeable future. But iPadOS 26 will surely tempt me to experiment.""]",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXdTMmhYVldZdFVtZFlUMDVIVFJDZUF4amxCU2dLTWdhaGM0eXR0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

The iPad Is a Full-On Computer Now,https://www.wired.com/story/the-ipad-is-a-full-on-computer-now/,"[""“THIS IS WHAT you've all been waiting for.” That's what Craig Federighi stated with a gleeful grin on his face as he introduced the latest changes to the iPad at Apple's WWDC25 keynote."", ""He wasn't talking about new iPad hardware, new software features, or AI implementation that didn't suck. He was talking about windows. You know, those things that computers have. With the release of iPadOS 26, Apple gives these tablets the ability to use conventional windowing—and iPads will never be the same."", 'iPad users can resize windows, move them around, tile them, and even use Exposé.', 'Windows are exactly the kind of PC-like interface Apple has resisted for so many years on the iPad, despite what its most dedicated fans have requested. The iPad, after all, was famously first sold as something that is not a computer. Welp, so much for that.', ""In iPadOS 26, which is coming out later this fall, you can easily drag windows around your screen or grab a corner to resize them. You can even tile multiple apps and use extra windows on top of those. That's a huge multitasking upgrade. In the past, you've been stuck with either full-screen apps or side-by-side split-screen, dramatically diminishing what you could accomplish on an iPad."", ""Now obviously, these windows come with a lot of messiness, so iPadOS 26 also introduces “familiar” controls to arrange and organize all these windows. If you hover over the corner of a window, for example, the three-button Mac controls will appear, letting you close or minimize the app, or make it full-screen. Apple has also brought over many intuitive Mac trackpad gestures, including clearing apps to see the desktop or Exposé, which let's you choose an app from the ones you have open. For Mac people out there, you may remember Exposé as a classic Mac feature that was folded into Mission Control back in 2011."", 'Multitasking has arrived on the iPad.', ""In case you think I'm exaggerating about the magnitude of the update, I should note that iPadOS's refresh contains far more than just windows. The update also introduces a traditional cursor, a floating Menu Bar in apps, a highly improved Files app, Preview, and the ability to select audio and video inputs. All of a sudden, a lot of those tasks you only felt comfortable doing on a Mac are now accomplished almost identically on an iPad. You've got a real computer in your hands."", 'The new menu bar in iPadOS.', ""The iPad started as a blown-up iPhone, and that has always been the main criticism of the product line, even upon its initial release in 2010. While the iPad found a use as a more casual device for traveling or lounging on the couch, the long-term growth of the iPad has been slowing. Now, there's less and less reason to upgrade between generations. That's held true even as Apple has brought increasingly capable hardware to the iPad with the introduction of the iPad Pro starting in 2015. XDR screens, M-series chips, more capable keyboards—none of it really mattered as long as the software was holding it back. If you've always salivated over the idea of using the iPad as your only computer, your time has come."", ""But Apple has been heading in this direction for a while. In 2020, the Magic Keyboard brought an extra port and a full trackpad to the iPad. Then in 2022, the company introduced external display support, and finally, in the 2024 update to iPad Pros, the webcam was moved in portrait mode. But this year's update really feels like it reached the tipping point. And Apple sold the premise in two really smart ways too."", ""Firstly, most iPad users may never even realize the windowing feature is there. Like many deeper iPad features, windowing is purely optional and hidden by default. Open an app on your iPad, and it still defaults to full-screen. It seem likely that the average person would never notice the tiny resizing icon in the bottom right corner of apps. That's an important design decision, as it keeps intact the primary identity of the iPad as a simpler interface."", 'Second, Apple coyly never referred to these new elements as Mac-like during the keynote, instead merely calling them ""familiar."" It even spaced iPadOS and macOS apart from each other within the presentation, careful to not call attention to just how similar these two products have become. Apple would never want to pit two of its products against each other, and has always implied that there\'s reason for someone to own both an iPad and a Mac. But with iPadOS 26, let\'s be real: That requires some serious cognitive dissonance to believe now.', 'Tiled windows in iPadOS 26.', ""I'm not suggesting iPads will ever replace the MacBook Pro. The people who really need that extra performance will always flock to those more powerful Macs. But what about Apple's far more popular laptop, the MacBook Air?"", ""The iPad Pro and MacBook Air have always been confusingly close in price and specs—surely, there's danger of Apple cannibalizing its own products. I don't doubt Apple will keep both around as long as possible, but I feel more inclined than ever to compare the two directly. That's even more true since the iPadOS update will even be available on the base iPad and iPad mini when it officially rolls out later this Fall."", 'So, does all this mean that a proper union between iPadOS and macOS is in the works? Or how about a touchscreen MacBook? In the past, Apple has stated definitively that it has no plans to merge its operating systems. That was a declaration that earned cheers from the audience back at WWDC in 2018.

WWDC 2025: A reworked iPadOS and the dreams of a touchscreen MacBook,https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/wwdc-2025-a-reworked-ipados-and-the-dreams-of-a-touchscreen-macbook-101749514203823.html,"['', 'At the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2025 keynote, Apple has given iPadOS not just a new visual theme that is aligned with iOS and macOS, but also pivoted the tablet operating system more towards productivity and workflows. In other words, the iPadOS as a platform is now the closest it has ever been to macOS, the Mac computing device platform. And this is a significant shift from its proximity to iOS, as it had been till now.', 'On the agenda for the iPadOS 26 update that rolls out later this year, is a new approach to multi-tasking, that is handling multiple apps and windows within the display real estate, as well as reconfigured pointer for more precise control (instead of the scroll and highlight focus with the circular tracker); the introduction of an updated Files app, preview for managing PDF files and platform parity with Apple Intelligence introductions such as Live Translations.', 'Or as Apple calls it, a “biggest iPadOS release ever”. Of course, the Liquid Glass design adds a new visual dimension too. With this different approach to the software and therefore usability, Apple would hope to make an iPad or iPad Pro (particularly with the Magic Keyboard as well as the Apple Pencil) relevant for the typical MacBook buyer. The lack of proper productivity support for an iPad, at least what a Mac user would expect, otherwise created a complicated buying decision.', '“iPadOS 26 is our biggest iPadOS release ever, with powerful features that take the experience to the next level and transform what users can do on iPad. With a beautiful new design, an entirely new powerful and intuitive windowing system, even more features powered by Apple Intelligence, huge improvements to working with files, and new capabilities for creatives to power their workflows, iPadOS 26 makes our most versatile device even more capable,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, at the keynote.', 'That is the key to the iPadOS evolution, with a focus on productivity, more than the iPadOS has done thus far. The new windowing system to use the display real estate for more than one app at the same time, is aligned to how windows handling and Mission Control works on macOS across the entire Mac computing device portfolio. “Familiar window controls allow users to seamlessly close, minimise, resize, or tile their windows, "" is how Apple describes the changes.', 'Even the gestures to switch between the app windows, the flick gesture, is very reminiscent of how things work on a Mac. Users can place apps side by side, or use the flick gesture to view all open app tiles and quickly select from there. In addition, apps on the iPad will get a new menu bar, again much like how it is in macOS — quicker access to app specific functionality in File, Edit, Insert etc.', 'There will also be Apple Intelligence parity across iOS, macOS and iPadOS, including Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime, and Messages, and new actions in Shortcuts. The latter may be a particularly relevant piece of the AI jigsaw. An illustration of this is, comparison of an audio transcription of a class lecture with the notes a user may have written, and AI will add any key points that may have been missed.', 'While iPadOS doesn’t get a Finder reminiscent of macOS, the updated Files app does add a new List view for the data a user may be searching for, as well as the ability to drag any file from the Files app into the iPadOS dock.', 'The iPad is finally getting a native PDF handler, with the Mac’s Preview app being added to the iPadOS. Key functionality will include viewing and editing PDF files, as well as the ability to use the Apple Pencil to quickly fill out a form, or make notes on an existing PDF document.', 'Apple never released a touchscreen MacBook, something that was often demanded by many users.

Apps can be minimized, resized, and tiled and the OS can arrange them with a single flick."", 'iPadOS 26 borrows Expose from macOS, so you can quickly see all your open windows spread out on a single screen. And with Stage Manager, you can group windows into separate stages, which can also be split into internal and external displays.', ""Another major macOS feature being borrowed is the menu bar. Apps can now have a menu bar at the top, which can be enabled with a simple swipe down or by moving the mouse pointer to the top. This shows a full-fledged menu bar, much like you'd see on a Mac, and developers can also customize it to suit their apps. You might also notice macOS-style close, minimize, and resize controls in the corner."", 'The Preview app from the Mac also makes an appearance on the iPad with iPadOS 26. Now you can open all your images within this app while also being able to open and edit PDF files. It can even be used to draw and write on using the Apple Pencil.', 'Further complementing the multitasking capabilities are updates to Background Tasks. Now, apps that produce a long-running process, such as exporting a video or uploading a large file, can appear in Live Activities, allowing you to keep track of them while performing other tasks. Developers will have access to the updated Background Tasks API to let their apps take advantage of this feature.', 'The Files app also gets an overhaul on iPadOS 26. It has a new UI with an updated List view that shows more files on screen at once with additional information. Folders can be customized with custom colors, icons, and emojis to make them more identifiable. Also, folders can be dragged out onto the dock for easier access.', ""Other new features include being able to choose different microphones for each app or even individual websites. Voice Isolation removes ambient noise from recorded audio and those with select AirPods models will also get 'studio-quality' recording. Local capture lets you capture a high-quality recording of audio and video from any video conferencing app, so you can save or share these recordings afterward."", ""Finally, much like Apple's other platforms, iPadOS 26 is getting a fresh new coat of paint with Liquid Glass. This redesigns many UI elements with a new translucent material layer that responds to the content underneath it. iPadOS 26 also gets improved AI capabilities with new Apple Intelligence features, such as Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime, and Messages. You also get updated Shortcuts features with more powerful options that let you summarize text and create images."", 'iPadOS 26 will be available as a developer beta today and as a public beta next month. Final release will be out later this year for iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later), iPad Air (M2 and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (A16), iPad (8th generation and later), iPad mini (A17 Pro), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).', 'Wow, after 15 years, this is what Apple has in mind for the iPad, aka the Surface Pro. Embarassing. Zero vision, zero innovation, all they can think of how to justify charging people thousands of dollars for an iPad. Listening to the users? Jobs...', 'Useless update.

Why invest in all that power if the software can't take advantage of it?"", 'So, without being too dramatic, I think this coming WWDC is Apple’s last chance to show me it really knows what it’s doing with the iPad.', '', ""Why invest in all that power if the software can't take advantage of it?"", 'While I’d settle for new features that offer a more purposeful tablet experience while remaining entirely separate from the Mac, what I really want to see is Apple pushing the iPad towards a bolder, more capable role, leaving its ‘YouTube machine’ moniker firmly in the past.', ""One could even suggest having a separate fork to iPadOS, such as iPadOS Pro, that focuses on pro-grade multitasking, a better mouse-centric interface when using an iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and file management and transfer that's suitable for people doing professional work such as video editing."", ""There's always been the perceived concern that Apple wouldn't do this due to cannibalising MacBook users, but there's scope that by making iPadOS more macOS-like for iPad Pros you could get an more capable and flexible tablet that could augment one Apple product collection than dilute it; for example photographers and video editors could use an iPad Pro with a more pro-centric iPadOS to do on the fly edits or tap into powerful Apple Intelligence features, while out in the field, then move over to a MacBook Pro when back at their desk or in a more laptop-friendly environment."", ""So my hope is we see something special from Apple at WWDC that supercharges iPadOS, if not with an eye on professionals then in a fashion that really harnesses the M-series chip power to make iPadOS more distinct, and less of what's arguably a modified take on iOS 18."", 'WWDC 2025 kicks off on June 9 – be sure to bookmark our how to watch WWDC 2025 guide and keep an eye on our phones coverage and tablets coverage for the latest updates.

And when it comes to iPadOS 26 (yeah, Apple changed its naming scheme too), it might’ve just finally blurred the lines between iPads and MacBooks.', 'For starters, iPadOS 26 is getting some of the features Apple announced for iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe, like polls in the Messages app, Live Translation, and more. But what Apple primarily focused on during the event was improving the iPad’s multitasking capabilities. Apple announced a ""new windowing system on the iPad"" that\'ll allow you to finally resize app windows.', ""Basing off what we saw during the WWDC keynote, when you launch an app initially, it'll show up in full screen (as it always has). What's changing is that there will now be a grab handle at the bottom right, which you'll be able to use to fluidly resize windows. When you open other previously resized apps, instead of them taking up the entire screen, they'll now open in the exact same size and position. You'll also be able to move the windows around your screen."", ""You can arrange your open windows with tiling using gestures like a simple flick. Alternatively, you can tile them by clicking the window controls (that seemingly only appear when you're using a trackpad or mouse with your iPad), and you'll have more tiling options."", ""If all this sounds familiar, it's because it's basically how window management already works on macOS, just with a bit of an iPad touch. iPadOS 26 is also getting Exposé, which'll let you see all your open windows spread out."", ""According to Apple, the new windowing system will work exceptionally well with Stage Manager or for those with an external display and need more space to work across their devices. I frequently use my iPad to work and study on the go, so I'm really excited to see these new multitasking features finally being added."", ""iPadOS 26 is also getting a new menu bar, which'll let you access commands available in a particular app with a simple swipe down from the display (or by moving the cursor to the top if you're using a trackpad or mouse)."", 'Finally, in line with bringing more In line with bringing more macOS features to the iPad, iPadOS 26 is also getting the Preview app. That means iPad users won’t have to rely on third-party apps for something as simple as signing documents anymore.', 'After years of iPadOS upgrades feeling minor, this one finally feels significant. Similar to every year, all the features above will be available for testing starting today through the Apple Developer Program, and a public beta will be available next month.

Apple Announces iPadOS 26 With Updated Multitasking for a More MacOS-like Experience,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-announces-ipados-26-with-updated-multitasking-for-a-more-macos-like-experience/,"[""Apple's iPadOS is getting sleeker and smarter with these new features. Here's what's new."", ""The iPad may have just turned into the computer Apple's been calling it all this time. "", ""As expected, Apple announced the latest version of iPadOS at its WWDC conference on Monday, bringing with it a series of exciting new features for the popular tablet. Like iOS for iPhones, iPadOS will get a bump to version no. 26 as Apple brings more consistency to its OS lineup, including WatchOS, TVOS and VisionOS. It's a cosmetic change like the one we saw from Samsung in 2020 to align its smartphones to the years they were released."", ""Last year, we saw dramatic changes in iPadOS 18, and it makes this year's software update slightly less visually interesting in comparison, but there's enough new here to get excited about. Last year's iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 felt like one of the biggest visual overhauls Apple had done for either operating system in some time, introducing new ways for users to customize their home experience, along with the first Apple Intelligence features -- many of which will finally make their debut in this latest update. "", ""Possibly the biggest announcement in iPadOS 26 is the updated windowing system that will turn your multitasking game up to 11. Apple's blurring the lines between its operating systems with the latest iPad update. Any fear it may have had about the iPad cutting into Mac sales seems to be gone, as iPadOS makes the two feel more similar than ever.

Apple's approach to the iPad and iPhone operating systems focuses on refining what was introduced in last year's update while adding new features that make both feel like they're playing catch-up."", 'Apple announced a new design language called Liquid Glass that will span all of its operating systems. As the name suggests, a glass-like look will be found throughout several pieces of the UI, including a new ""all clear"" mode that looks slick and can be applied to all of your home screen icons. The new design takes cues from VisionOS on the Vision Pro headset, adding a new, futuristic vibe to your iPad. ', ""iPadOS 26's multitasking revamp makes the Magic Keyboard accessory feel necessary."", ""While Apple called iPadOS 26 the biggest update to its tablet operating system ever during its keynote, the new windowing system for multitasking might be the biggest feature on most people's minds. "", 'iPadOS 26 introduced a new way to resize your apps into floating windows so you can have multiple apps running at the same time and control exactly where you place them. Window tiling will allow users to rearrange windows with minimal effort. In addition, the new windowing system works with Stage Manager and external displays in case you need more space to work with. ', ""Another feature that iPadOS is borrowing from the Mac is Exposé, allowing you to get a quick view of all open windows -- demoed using the iPad's Magic Keyboard accessory. Said accessory is typically expensive but almost seems necessary to fully utilize all of iPadOS' new features."", ""The demos during the keynote gave iPadOS a MacOS quality, and if it functions as it should, users' productivity on an iPad is about to improve significantly. "", ""The best news is that the new windowing multitasking modes will work on all current iPads, even the basic one. How it works on smaller screens like the Mini, well, we'll find out."", ""The iPad is slowly becoming the touchscreen Mac you've always wanted."", ""Apple is pushing iPadOS into MacOS territory with the new way to multitask, and it didn't stop there. iPadOS will also get a brand new menu bar that will provide specific app feature settings or tips, and developers will be able to make adjustments to what's shown in the menu. "", ""To access the menu bar, you can swipe down from the top of the screen, and if you're using a mouse, you can bring your cursor to the top."", 'The Mac feelings continue in a redesigned Files app that now adds folders and a layout that even more closely resembles MacOS file browsing. The added list layouts and the flexible way the app can be used to drag files into the dock below give this a truly Mac-like vibe and should hopefully make working with files feel more natural. Folders can spring open to show content inside, too, and you can even choose default apps to open files in.', ""For anyone who podcasts or streams from an iPad, added audio-selection input controls seem like they'll also help. The added hook-ins should make accessories connect more easily."", 'A Preview app is coming, and it looks just like Preview that lives on the Mac. It supports Pencil annotations, but it should also be a more helpful way to manage files. Currently, looking at images and documents is a more awkward process run through the Files app; splitting out Preview should allow better multitasking.', ""For most of us, this version of iPadOS won't arrive until the iPhone 17 hits shelves -- something we anticipate happening in September. However, Apple has both a developer beta that is aimed at developers, with a more consumer-friendly beta arriving to those who want to test out the latest features from Apple with more reliability. While the developer beta can typically be installed via the settings on your iPhone, we'll keep this article updated for any news on the public beta release date for iPadOS 26.
