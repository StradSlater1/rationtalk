Second attempt by Japanese company to land on moon likely ends in failure,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/moon-japan-crash-landing,"['Resilience would have made history as the first non-US commercial lander to make a successful touchdown', 'An attempt to land a commercially built spacecraft on the surface of the moon looked to have ended in failure on Thursday, two years after its predecessor, launched by the same Japanese company, crashed following an uncontrolled descent.', 'Resilience, an un-crewed vehicle from the Tokyo company ispace, would have made history as the first non-US commercial lander to make a successful touchdown, scheduled for 3.17pm ET Thursday (4.17am JST Friday) at Mare Frigoris (the Sea of Cold) in the far north of the moon.', 'But the company’s live stream covering the landing attempt ended almost 30 minutes later, with mission managers unable to establish communication with the craft, and its fate uncertain.', '“Mission control center members will continuously attempt to communicate with the lander,” an ispace commentator said immediately before the feed was pulled, promising an update at a press briefing “in a few hours”.', 'It brought back memories of the April 2023 failure of ispace’s Hakuto-R Mission 1, when communication with the spacecraft was lost around the scheduled time of landing. It was later established that a software error had led the lander to believe it had already touched down when it was still hurtling towards the lunar surface.', 'Resilience launched on 15 January from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that carried the Blue Ghost lander manufactured by the Texas startup Firefly Aerospace. Blue Ghost followed a speedier trajectory to the moon and made its own pioneering landing on 2 March.', 'The apparent demise of Hakuto-R Mission 2 would be a significant setback for ispace’s Venture Moon initiative that it said would be “laying the groundwork” for an extended human presence on the moon. Ambitious plans include a lunar city with a thousand residents, the first arriving as early as 2040.', 'It also hopes to eventually accommodate thousands more space tourists for shorter visits.', '“Our goal is to build the cislunar economy, one in which the moon and Earth are economically and socially connected,” ispace’s chief executive, Takeshi Hakamada, said in a prepared statement released before Thursday’s landing attempt.', '“We view the success of the lunar landing as merely a stepping stone toward that goal. We strongly believe that this endeavor and its long-term success will contribute to making life on Earth sustainable for all humanity.”', 'Resilience was set to deploy a small, European-built moon rover named Tenacious for a two-week mission. High-definition video footage and telemetry would have been beamed back to Earth for monitoring by the European Space Agency (Esa) and partners.', 'The rover has a shovel intended to collect soil samples for evaluation as the search for evidence of the presence of life-sustaining water or ice on the moon continues.', 'Nasa, the US space agency, will pay ispace $5,000 under an agreement signed in 2020 for a chunk of regolith it can study in furtherance of its own plans to land humans back on the moon for the first time since 1972, and ultimately on Mars.', '“Tenacious is hopefully a very successful technological achievement, but beyond the technology it’s also a symbol of the future of lunar exploration,” Géraldine Naja, Esa’s director of commercialization, industry and competitiveness, told reporters earlier on Thursday.', '“Esa is extremely proud and thrilled to support ispace Mission 2. This is a very good example of how we can support new space actors in Europe [and] commercialization. We are eager to support, eventually, a sustainable European-Japanese presence on the moon.”', 'The 11lb (5kg) rover was also carrying a more quirky payload: Moonhouse, a model installation created by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg, that would have become the first property on the moon, albeit in miniature form.', 'The bright red Swedish-style house was to have provided a splash of color against the gray backdrop of the moon’s northern reaches.', '“It’s a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity and vulnerability,” Genberg told space.com in an interview published on Thursday.', '“I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world.”', 'While the governments of five countries – the US, Russia, China, India and Japan – have successfully landed un-crewed robotic lunar explorers, commercial efforts have seen more failures than successes in recent years.', 'In addition to the previous ispace flop, two attempts by the Texas company Intuitive Machines (IM), with its Odysseus and Athena landers in February 2024 and March 2025 respectively, ended prematurely when both spacecraft toppled over on landing.', 'Mare Frigoris is a flatter area of the moon, with fewer boulders than the landing sites chosen by IM and Firefly.', 'Ispace also chose to take its time getting to the moon, with the five-month journey of Resilience during a so-called low-energy transfer allowing the company to thoroughly evaluate its systems and computer programs after blaming a software error for the 2023 crash landing.', 'A contract with Nasa will see ispace attempting to send a larger rover to the moon on a mission scheduled for 2027.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVdRbEZLUm5keWNuWmpTSEpMVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhaFZJNk9KUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

The blackout has triggered a tense wait for confirmation as flight controllers pore over data from the final descent.', 'The mission marked ispace’s second lunar attempt, a follow-up to its 2023 moonshot that ended in a crash.', 'Launched from Florida in January, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. Its final descent targeted a flat plain in the Mare Frigoris, or “Sea of Cold,” a relatively benign region on the moon’s near-north side. The selected landing site, with its smooth terrain and sparse boulder coverage, was considered ideal for a safe landing.', 'But despite a smooth descent, telemetry data indicated a sudden drop in altitude just before the planned touchdown at 4:17 a.m. JST (1917 GMT).

"Resilience spacecraft likely crashed into the moon, Ispace confirms",https://www.cnn.com/science/live-news/moon-landing-mission-ispace-06-05-25,"['• Resilience, a lander built by Japan-based company Ispace, attempted to touch down on the moon around 3:17 p.m. ET. But the mission failed to land safely, Ispace officials confirmed hours later.', '• The exact reasons for the mission’s failure are currently unclear. However, Ispace leaders said the lander has likely crashed into the lunar surface.', '• This was the second attempt at a soft landing by Ispace, which is headquartered in Tokyo.', '• Resilience was one of several robotic landers developed by companies and governments across the world as part of a renewed race to explore the lunar surface.', '• Earlier this year, two NASA-backed, Texas-based companies — Firefly and Intuitive Machines — each made moon-landing attempts. Firefly’s was the first fully successful effort by a commercial outfit, while Intuitive Machines’ lander tipped on its side.', '• NASA was not directly backing this attempt, but Ispace is working with the US space agency on a future lunar mission.', 'We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Scroll through the posts below to relive the Resilience spacecraft’s moon-landing attempt as it unfolded.', 'Ispace has gone out of its way to make clear that it’s not giving up. The motto underpinning today’s mission was “never quit the lunar quest.” And by all accounts, the company has every intention of sticking with these moon missions until they succeed.', 'During a news conference hours after the landing attempt, Ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada compared Ispace to SpaceX.', '“SpaceX has also failed several times, but now SpaceX occupies the launching market,” Hakamada said.', 'In the earliest days of the Elon Musk-run company, there were several brutal failures of the company’s first rocket, the Falcon 1. It was only on the fourth try, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy, that SpaceX successfully sent one of its launch vehicles to orbit in 2008.', 'Before today’s landing attempt, Ispace chief financial officer Jumpei Nozaki told CNN that the company already has the money locked down for a third try at a lunar touchdown. And that likely would not be affected by a failure during Resilience’s mission.', 'The company is working with US-based company Draper, which has its roots in NASA’s Apollo program, on a lander called Apex 1.0. That vehicle is slated to travel to the far side of the moon as soon as 2027.', 'Until then, Ispace has its work cut out for it. Hakamada said during the news briefing he will need to work to regain the trust of investors, and the company will need to deeply investigate what went wrong on the Resilience mission to ensure similar issues don’t plague Apex 1.0.', '“This is our second failure, and about these results, we have to really take it seriously,” Hakamada said in translated remarks.', 'Resilience had been circling about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the moon in a stable, circular orbit, Ispace confirmed. It then descended successfully to about 20 kilometers (12 miles).', 'At that point, Resilience “successfully fired its main engine as planned to begin deceleration.”', 'It was not clear exactly how the vehicle was oriented, however. Ispace confirmed only that the spacecraft’s orientation was “nearly vertical” before data was lost.', 'Before landing, Resilience was expected to complete a pitch-over or roll maneuver that would change its position from lying horizontal in relation to the moon’s surface to sitting upright.', 'But the biggest issue may lie in how Resilience measured its altitude. That sounds similar to why Ispace’s first lander, the Hakuto-R spacecraft that crash landed in 2023, failed. However, executives said the problems appear to be different.', 'During Ispace’s 2023 failed landing attempt, Hakuto-R’s software wrongly threw out correct altitude data, which led to the failed landing attempt.', 'During Resilience’s touchdown attempt today, a laser rangefinder — or a sensor designed to measure distance to the moon’s surface — “experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values.”', '“As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing,” a statement from the company noted. “Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.”', 'That indicates Resilience likely crashed.', 'Executives at Ispace are not yet sure what may have happened to Resilience.', 'The company’s Japan-based leadership said that information sent back from the spacecraft to mission control in the moment before landing was different from the issue that plagued Ispace’s first Hakuto-R lunar lander during a 2023 mission.', '“The data that we’ve been looking at — it wasn’t exactly the same as we have seen from the first mission,” said Ispace’s Chief Technology Officer Ryo Ujiie in translated remarks.', 'The Hakuto-R spacecraft crash-landed during that trip after a software error caused the vehicle to miscalculate its altitude.', 'NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is an imaging satellite in orbit around the moon, captured a shot of the first Hakuto-R’s landing site — showing an impact crater that confirmed the vehicle had crashed.', 'Executives confirmed that they will once again ask NASA if the agency can tune the LRO’s cameras to help confirm what may have happened with Resilience. The spacecraft was expected to land in within a 750-mile-long (1,200-kilometer-long) plain called Mare Frigoris — or the “Sea of Cold.”', 'During a news conference, Ispace executives confirmed they are no longer trying to regain contact with the lander.', '“This is our second failure, and about these results, we have to really take it seriously,” Ispace’s CEO Takeshi Hakamada said in translated remarks.', 'Mission teams will now look to do a thorough review of what went wrong and apply lessons learned to Ispace’s next project, an attempted lunar landing of a craft called Apex 1.0.', 'Ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada, who is currently in Tokyo where Resilience mission control center is located, is set to conduct a news conference at 8 p.m. ET.', 'The event will be broadcast on YouTube here.', 'Ispace’s Resilience lander did not take a direct route to the moon, like some spacecraft that went before it, zooming to the lunar surface in mere days.', 'Resilience instead took a slow, swooping path to the moon that took over four months. (Such a gradual trip required little fuel, which is one way the company has managed to keep Resilience’s price tag down.)', 'During that time, three teams of Ispace employees have been rotating in and out of the company’s mission control room in Tokyo. Ispace hasn’t needed large teams “on console” — the aerospace term for when an engineer is managing data on a computer in mission control — but at least some engineers have been keeping a close eye over the vehicle during every stretch of this mission.', 'That experience is extremely valuable, Ispace’s founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada and chief financial officer Jumpei Nozaki told CNN in interviews conducted earlier this year.', '“What is good about this four- or five-month trajectory is, every day, there are small things that happen … something we didn’t expect…This (journey to the moon) is really a learning phase.”', 'Jumpei Nozaki, Ispace CFO', 'All lunar landing attempts — even missions such as this with no humans on board — bring with them an element of risk and awe.', 'Success is far from guaranteed. Overall, more than half of all lunar landing attempts have ended in failure, tough odds for a feat humanity first pulled off nearly 60 years ago.', 'While technology has advanced in the past five decades, the fundamental challenges of landing on the moon remain the same. Here’s what Resilience has had to overcome — and what it has yet to face.', 'As the space community and stakeholders looked on, waiting for confirmation about the status of the Resilience lander, Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, told CNN he did not see anything concerning in the live data shared on the livestream.', '“I’m not in the mission control room. I’m not seeing the telemetry, but I’m getting updates on my phone — everything was normal” in the moments before touchdown, Garan said.', 'Garan also highlighted a fact that many companies vying to build lunar landers have acknowleged: When attempting to develop the technology to go to the moon — and do it on a private-sector budget — it’s a tough feat.', 'Ispace does have another shot to get this right: The company has a new lander, called Apex 1.0, that it’s developing alongside US-based company Draper. That mission is slated to fly in 2027, and Ispace says it’s got all the funding it needs to get through that mission.', '“The reason why we’re doing this,” Garan said of today’s landing attmept, “is to learn.”', '“What Ispace has done in the past and will continue to do in the future, is be very open, very transparent, if anything did go wrong,” Garan added.', 'Ispace just posted an update on social media confirming that the company has not given up hope on the lander.', 'At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with RESILIENCE, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander. We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few… pic.twitter.com/D2TMGHK5f3', 'Ispace also took a few hours to confirm that its last lander failed. Ispace’s CEO previously told CNN that he expected to have contact with the lander at least within the first 10 minutes if everything had gone according to plan.', 'Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, told CNN in an interview: “I’m optimistic that we will have a good outcome.”', 'Garan said teams can still troubleshoot possible reasons that there may be communications issues with the lander. If the vehicle is tipped on its side, for example, that could create a situation where it takes mission controllers longer to get in touch with Resilience.', '“There also is the possibility that we’re not successful. We didn’t land successful. And so if that is the case, then we’re going to figure out, just like we did on Mission 1, figure out what the lessons learned are,” he said.', 'Ispace’s motto for this mission has been “never quit the lunar quest.” And the company’s CFO previously told CNN that Ispace is fully funded through its third mission, which will make use of a new lander model called Apex 1.0, and will be carried out as part of a contract with NASA.', 'Scott Kelly, the former NASA astronaut famous for his “year in space,” was at the Ispace watch party in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In an interview with CNN, he said he stopped by to support his friend and fellow NASA astronaut corps alumnus Ron Garan, the company’s chairman.', '“What (Ispace) is doing is really exciting. But space is hard, and the mood is harder, and like Ron was saying, they met a lot of their objectives so far, which is great,” Kelly said.', 'He also responded to questions about the space policy furor unfolding on Capitol Hill.', 'President Donald Trump abruptly yanked his support of the Elon Musk-backed NASA administrator nominee, Jared Isaacman, over the weekend.', '“That’s really unfortunate,” Kelly said. “(Isaacman is) such a great guy, and I think uniquely, uniquely qualified for this moment. … I think he would have been an outstanding administrator.”', 'When asked about Trump’s stated plan to explore Mars — a pivot away from his first-term goal of focusing on returning astronauts to the moon — alongside lunar landing efforts, Kelly said, “NASA is constantly hamstrung by the fact that when we get a new administration, we get a new plan.”', '“When President Biden was elected, my brother (Democratic Senator Mark Kelly) made a point to his administration that just because it was President Trump’s plan doesn’t mean we need to abandon it,” Scott Kelly said.', 'When asked about Trump’s proposal to slash NASA’s science budget by almost 50%, Kelly said NASA “will be decimated.”', 'On the livestream, Ispace said “we haven’t been able to confirm, but (mission control) members will continuously attempt to communicate with the lander.”', '“This is part of the business, unfortunately,” ISpace’s Ron Garan added at an event in Washington, DC. But “one really important thing is the bar is open now.”', 'Ispace executives and industry leaders that have gathered at a watch party in Washington, DC are nervously awaiting news.', 'To fill time, Ron Garan, a former NASA astronaut and the chairman of Ispace’s US subsidiary, is taking questions from the crowd about Ispace’s long-term goals.', 'He added during a pause, “If I knew how to tap dance, I would.”', 'Cameras at Ispace’s mission control have panned to concerned looking faces on engineers.', 'The status of the vehicle is still unknown, nearly 10 minutes after its projected touchdown time.', 'Earlier, Ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada had told CNN that mission controllers would ideally learn about a safe touchdown within a minute after landing. After several minutes of troubleshooting, the odds of this mission ending in a success story are beginning to look unlikely.', 'It’s past the time that Resilience should have landed on the moon. But a clear confirmation of the vehicle’s health and safety has not been given.', 'At a watch event in Washington, DC, the crowd is quiet and in suspense.', 'The vehicle is currently just 5 kilometers, or 3 miles, above the lunar surface. Landing should be just moments away. But on the livestream, officials cautioned not to be led astray if the data reading for altitude hits “zero.”', 'Mission controllers will need to deliver independent confirmation of a safe landing.', 'The vehicle is now beginning its pitch over and final descent.', 'There will be no live footage of Reslience’s landing attempt. On missions to deep space, antennas communicating with Earth have limited bandwidth, and mission controllers prioritize precision data over stunning views.', 'But Resilience should be able to give Ispace a clear indication of how the landing went within just moments.', '“We have sensors installed on our landing gear,” Ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada told CNN. “Once we land on the moon, there’s a switch that can confirm the landing, and then the signal comes to us.”', 'During Ispace’s first lanar landing attempt in 2023, that signal never came through, which is why mission controllers had a pretty early indication that something was wrong, Hakamada said. After 10 minutes of troubleshooting, mission controllers declared that landing attempt a failure.', 'During the “breaking burn phase” — the lander will “burn very furiously, and then we try to reduce it as much as we can.”', 'The next phase, called the “breaking burn slash pitch up phase,” will see the vehicle pitch over to the upright position.', 'Then the vehicle will enter “terminal descent,” as Resilience moves to mere meters above the surface.', 'The final phase is called terminal landing. That’s when the lander’s engines cut off and — hopefully — mission teams can confirm a safe touchdown.', 'It’s time for the lander to begin rapidly decelerating. An engine burn lasting about 10 minutes just kicked off. It’s one of the first steps in the final landing process.', '© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

But mission control lost contact with the spacecraft shortly after it started its descent.', 'A laser tool used by the spacecraft to measure Resilience’s distance from the surface was experiencing delays, Ispace says in a statement. The malfunction likely prevented the lander from slowing down enough, resulting in a hard landing on the lunar surface.', '“At this point, we do not know clearly about the cause,” said Ispace chief executive Takeshi Hakamada, the chief executive of Ispace in translated remarks, reports Kenneth Chang for the New York Times. The company is working on analyzing the telemetry data it has obtained so far to pinpoint the exact problem, he adds in a statement.', 'This is Ispace’s second failed lunar landing. In 2023, its spacecraft crashed into the lunar surface because of a software issue. Despite these two setbacks, Ispace does not seem to be giving up, pointing to SpaceX’ success. “SpaceX has also failed several times, but now SpaceX occupies the launching market,” Hakamada said in a news conference yesterday, reports Jackie Wattles for CNN.', 'Resilience took off on January 15 aboard a SpaceX rocket carrying another commercial lander, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost. Blue Ghost touched down on the moon in March and completed its mission, but Resilience took a longer route to the moon.

Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.', 'CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.', 'Two years ago, the company’s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name “Resilience” for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist’s toy-size red house for placement on the moon’s dusty surface.', 'Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.', '“This is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,"" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.', 'A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. ""Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,” the company said in a written statement.', 'Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.', 'Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.', 'Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon’s south pole and was declared dead within hours.', 'Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side’s northern tier.', 'Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.', 'Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace’s European-built rover — named Tenacious — sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.', 'The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.', 'Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.', 'The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.', 'Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. “Engineers did everything they possibly could” to ensure success this time, he said.', 'He considered the latest moonshot “merely a steppingstone” to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.', 'Ispace, like other businesses, does not have “infinite funds” and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace’s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.', 'While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it’s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.', 'Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year’s end: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic’s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth’s atmosphere.', 'For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.', ""NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030."", 'The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
