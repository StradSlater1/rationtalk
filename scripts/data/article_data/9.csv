Smithsonian stalled after Donald Trump's announcement of Kim Sajet's firing,https://www.finestresullarte.info/en/news/smithsonian-stalled-after-donald-trump-s-announcement-of-kim-sajet-s-firing,"['We use cookies', 'We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our website, to show you personalized content and targeted ads, to analyze our website traffic, and to understand where our visitors are coming from.', 'President Donald Trump ’s announcement of the firing of National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet(here for previous article) has opened an institutional rift that calls into question the relationship between the White House and one of America’s most important cultural institutions. Four days after the announcement, the Smithsonian Institution, of which the National Portrait Gallery is a part, has yet to make any official comment on the matter, nor has it confirmed that it accepts the president’s authority over the removal of a museum director from a top post.', 'At an emergency meeting Monday, Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Griffith Bunch III and the institution’s board of trustees discussed how to respond to the presidential communication. The firing of Kim Sajet, who has led the museum for years, was announced via social media by Trump himself, who called her “a very partisan person and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position,” in reference to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI, precisely) programs. According to Trump, such positions would be “totally inappropriate” for someone in a leadership role at a national museum.', 'The White House provided the New York Times with a list of reasons it said prompted the decision. The list includes Sajet’s involvement as a coauthor of the volume The Obama Portraits, the posting on social media of images with Democratic political figures such as Hillary Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama, and an appearance by her at a reception hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris. Some of these activities were part of his institutional duties, but the administration also highlighted campaign donations to Democratic Party figures, including Clinton and current President Joe Biden, totaling $3,982.40.', 'The case has opened a sensitive front for the Smithsonian. Although the institution receives about two-thirds of its funding from the federal government, it is not part of the executive branch, nor is it configured as a government agency. It is governed by a 17-member board, partly appointed by Congress, partly chosen by the board itself and approved by a resolution signed by the president. Members include, by right, the vice president and the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Under this structure, the power of the president of the United States to intervene directly in the appointment or dismissal of museum directors is legally uncertain. The Smithsonian’s official website calls it a public trust, with its own internal governance and a secretary who serves as chief executive officer. The president’s role, therefore, appears more limited than the announcement of Sajet’s dismissal suggests. Still, the White House has not made clear how it interprets its authority with respect to the Smithsonian’s top leadership, nor has it responded to inquiries on the matter. Trump has already lobbied the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he secured the chairmanship of the board and the appointment of his own ally as interim president. Now, in a new executive order, he has instructed Vice President JD Vance to examine the Smithsonian in conjunction with Congress. In the order, the president denounces a “revisionist movement” that he says intends to rewrite American history in negative terms, undermining the nation’s founding principles.', '“President Trump does not have the authority to fire Smithsonian Institution employees, including the director of the National Portrait Gallery,” Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, and Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.', 'In an interview with the New York Times in 2022, Sajet had said that for centuries portraits had been the preserve of the white, male elite, and thus contributed to a distorted view of American history. Under his leadership, the National Portrait Gallery has promoted exhibitions devoted to hitherto marginalized figures and expanded the inclusion of contemporary artists committed to social issues such as immigration and racial inequality. One of the items cited by the White House as evidence of the director’s alleged political bias concerns a caption that appeared next to a photograph of President Trump inside the museum. The text, about an image that is not the official presidential portrait, which is still not on display, reads "" Impeached twice on charges of abuse of power and inciting insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials."" On this point, too, neither Sajet nor the museum board made any statement.', 'After the presidential announcement, Rebecca Kasemeyer, director of public engagement at the National Portrait Gallery, sent an email to the commissioners asking them not to make any statements to the press pending clarification from the Smithsonian. Sajet herself requested to meet with the museum’s board on Tuesday through its president. “Kim is talking to Central Smithsonian and we are waiting for guidance,” Kasemeyer wrote in an email sent to The New York Times. “We will certainly keep everyone updated as we learn more.”', '“The president is right that Sajet is biased,” said James Panero, executive editor of New Criterion, a conservative art magazine. “He has only shown contempt for the National Portrait Gallery collection while committing half of his acquisition budget to so-called diversity initiatives. There has been nothing different in the results, with politicized exhibitions like ’UnSeen’ depicting the symbolic destruction of historical portraits in the permanent collection.”Online art courses', '“Kim is a great colleague, committed, proactive and collaborative,” says Thomas Patrick Campbell, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. “She has been courageous and thoughtful in expanding the N.P.G.’s mandate to really challenge what it means to be an American and who should be represented in the N.P.G. She should be receiving awards for her work, not this vindictive treatment.”', 'The situation also raised broader questions about the role of national museum directors and their independence from political influence. Dean Sobel, professor of museum studies at the University of Denver, emphasized that directors should not be judged on their political orientation, but on their ability to make the museum reflect the public it serves. In his view, Sajet was doing “a good job.” The case brings to mind an earlier episode: during Trump’s first term, his administration had already focused attention on the National Gallery of Art, with which the National Portrait Gallery is often confused. There, DEI initiatives were suspended to comply with an executive order banning diversity programs in federally funded organizations.', '', '', '', 'Warning: the translation into English of the original Italian article was created using automatic tools.

Last week, the Washington Post reported that Sajet was continuing to work at the National Portrait Gallery despite Trump’s supposed firing. The Post also reported that the Trump administration provided, as justification for the dismissal, a 17-point list of what the administration described as times Sajet spoke or acted in ways critical of Trump.', 'The Smithsonian’s statement seemed to allude obliquely to the administration’s complaints, writing, “To reinforce our nonpartisan stature, the Board of Regents has directed the Secretary to articulate specific expectations to museum directors and staff regarding content in Smithsonian museums, give directors reasonable time to make any needed changes to ensure unbiased content, and to report back to the Board on progress and any needed personnel changes based on success or lack thereof in making the needed changes.”', 'The National Portrait Gallery is one of many museums managed by the Smithsonian, whose network also includes the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, all in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian also manages a few museums outside D.C., including the National Museum of the American Indian, which operates a New York branch in addition a D.C. one.', 'The statement comes just days after the White House released its proposed 2026 budget, which calls for a 12 percent reduction in funding to the Smithsonian. The cuts would eliminate separate funding to the long-gestating National Museum of the American Latino, forcing it to reduce staff from 35 people to just 6. The Anacostia Community Museum, meanwhile, would be folded into the NMAAHC.', 'In a video conference call with the National Portrait Gallery board of commissioners last week, Sajet said that the budget cuts would fall disproportionately on the museums’ facilities and infrastructure, the New York Times reported Monday. “That’s maintaining our museums, storage, upgrades and, you know, all the care that goes into it,” she said.', 'Trump has previously targeted the Smithsonian in the form of an executive order in which he accused its museums of putting forward “improper ideology” via “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values.” That executive order singled out shows at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture.', ""The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

The Smithsonian Institution, a network of museums that operates the National Portrait Gallery, has yet to issue a statement about Trump’s comments on Sajet.', 'This week, however, the Washington Post revealed the Trump administration’s reasoning for seeking to oust Sajet. A White House official provided the Post with a 17-point list of what the administration described as times Sajet spoke or acted in ways critical of Trump.', '', 'One of those times involved the exhibition of a portrait of Trump that bore a caption referring to his two impeachments, as well as his “incitement of insurrection” on January 6, 2021. The White House reportedly also singled out Sajet’s donations to Democratic causes and noted interviews in which she mentioned wanting to expand the diversity of the museum’s offerings, including one with USA Today in 2019 in which she said, “I’m not interested in only having a museum for some people.”', 'The White House has yet to demonstrate how Trump has the power to fire Sajet, and even did not respond to the New York Times this week when asked to do so. Trump does not sit on the board of the Smithsonian, which does include some members nominated by the president. J.D. Vance, Trump’s vice president, is on the board with ex officio status, as is the Chief Justice of the United States.', 'Two Democratic members of the House of Representatives—House Administration Committee ranking Democrat Joseph Morelle of New York and House Appropriations Committee ranking Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut have issued a statement in which they said Trump has “no authority” to fire Sajet. “The dismissal of Director Sajet is unacceptable and has the same legal weight as the President’s prior attempts to undermine the Smithsonian’s independence: absolutely none,” they wrote.', 'How the Smithsonian will respond remains an open question.

"We in the cultural sector must stand up to Trump’s attacks – if not now, when?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/04/smithsonian-institution-donald-trump-cultural-sector,"['My former colleagues at the Smithsonian in Washington DC face unprecedented pressure. I urge them to defend their principles', 'Gus Casely-Hayford is director of London’s V&A East', 'I\nn one of his recent Truth Social posts, Donald Trump appeared to fire Kim Sajet – the fearless and utterly brilliant director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. The president used his social media platform to claim that Sajet’s support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) made her unsuitable for her role. “Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery”, Trump wrote. “She is a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly.”', 'Where to start? By now, we all know the arts has become the terrain for a brutal proxy battle for hearts and minds. A culture war 2.0, where not just reputations are at stake, but institutions, whole sectors and ways of thinking. But I am hoping that even Trump’s support base have begun to grow a little bored with these attacks on figures and institutions in the cultural sector. The culture war has moved beyond farce into the deeply tragic.', 'I am sure even many of the president’s most loyal supporters know deep down that the Smithsonian (a vast complex of 21 museums) is a genuine force for good, an institution that represents so much of the US at its very best. And like the Kennedy Center, the cultural institution that Trump took control of earlier this year, or the universities his administration has attacked, the Smithsonian is a fish in a barrel: easy to bully, its financial destiny in significant part tied to public funding, with limited scope to defend itself. This contrived political theatre damages critical institutions, threatens the careers of talented, dedicated people, and its repercussions will be deep and long-lasting.', 'Good museums are not sleepy institutions trapped in heritage-aspic. Across its 178-year history, the Smithsonian has consistently evolved to reflect ambient change and address public need. Like many other national museums around the world, these changes, particularly in recent years, have been driven by an aspiration to engage and enfranchise, to broaden audiences and to catalyse national conversations. I would have thought that seeking to give value back to a greater number of the population is uncontroversial. Institutions this important, mostly sponsored by the public, must simply, continually, work to be ever more universal, inclusive and open. Left or right, that has value. In times like these, when we are, as citizens of western democracies, so riven and divided, the arts have a job to do of being a space for inclusive debate.', 'But the truth is that DEI isn’t some new-fangled indulgence. That drive to be inclusive is what good museums were created to deliver. Twenty-five years ago, I began my career at the British Museum. I still remember reading its founding purpose for the first time. The British Museum was created for “all studious and curious persons”. I remember thinking that the word that does the really hard work in that statement is “all”. The British Museum was created in the mid-18th century around an inclusive imperative, around the idea that we might all hope to find ourselves reflected in its spaces and concerns.', 'Its founders must have recognised the powerful need for a national museum: it was created at a time when Britain was going through a period of existential anxiety, when Scots were rebelling; the country needed a unifying narrative. I am sure the British Museum’s founders knew exactly what they were doing when they committed the institution to that beautifully enfranchising ambition of being for us all. And yes, I know museums have so often failed miserably to live up to these inclusive objectives, but we must never stop trying, nor relinquish the basis on which the public can hold us to account.', 'Universities and museums are vital for healthy societies, and their independence, their bravery, their sometimes maddening honesty, underpins so much that is important. We undermine that at our peril. I spent a number of treasured years as a Smithsonian museum director and fell for its ethos and its dedicated people. It was founded on an ambition to propagate “the increase and diffusion of knowledge”. It was created to enable transformational change through sharing and empowering US citizens with knowledge, with truth.

Bunch III, 10 days after President Donald Trump claimed that he had fired the director of the institution’s National Portrait Gallery. The board, which issued its statement after an all-day meeting Monday, also said that it supported Bunch’s “authority and management” of the Smithsonian.', 'The statement did not directly mention the high-stakes standoff between the White House and Kim Sajet, who has still been reporting to work.', 'In the statement, the board said it had directed Bunch to ensure the Smithsonian remains free of political bias — a seeming nod to the tense political climate that has enveloped federally funded arts institutions since Trump’s return to office in January. The regents instructed Bunch to clearly outline expectations for museum directors and staff “to ensure unbiased content,” and to report back on “any needed personnel changes” based on progress.', '“The Board of Regents is committed to ensuring that the Smithsonian is a beacon of scholarship free from political or partisan influence, and we recognize that our institution can and must do more to further these foundational values,” the statement read.', 'The announcement represents an interim move by the Board of Regents to uphold its governance procedures, a spokesperson said Monday night.', 'The president on May 30 called Sajet “highly partisan and a strong supporter of DEI” in a social media post announcing he had fired her. The White House later shared with The Washington Post 17 examples it said supported the president’s claims about Sajet, which included her donations to Democratic presidential candidates and past interviews about expanding the gallery’s representation.', 'Fourth on that list were Sajet’s reported comments rejecting artist Julian Raven’s Trump painting for submission in the National Portrait Gallery. Sajet told him “it’s too pro-Trump” and “too political,” Raven recalled in an interview with the Washingtonian in 2019.', 'The president did not cite any legal authority for removing Sajet.', 'Ahead of the meeting on Monday morning, several dozen former and current staff members gathered outside of the National Museum of American History to welcome the regents and show their support for Bunch. The regents, who meet at least four times a year, convened at the museum on Monday while their usual venue, the Smithsonian Institution Building, is under renovation.', 'The secretary, who arrived to cheers and “We love Lonnie” signs, was emotional as he hugged and took photos with supporters.', '“We are all here because we love the Smithsonian,” Bunch told the crowd. “As long as I’m in this chair, I’m with you. We will continue to be the institution the public deserves and the public needs. And I cannot tell you enough — you’re going to make me cry — thank you.”', 'As Bunch headed inside the museum, he hugged Beth Py-Lieberman, who retired in 2023 after serving as an editor of Smithsonian Magazine for 37 years. “I was lucky to work closely with Lonnie in the years that I worked at the Smithsonian ... I feel that I’m a good friend to him and I feel that a lot of people feel that way,” she said.', '“This is a leader that is the best for us, for the Smithsonian and he represents a lifetime of service to the nation,” Py-Lieberman continued. “He’s created a museum, he’s personally involved with the staff, he’s raised from donors around the United States a phenomenal amount of money — but also spirit, love and affection. … Each one of these people is representing 10 or 15 more folks back in the offices.”', 'Some demonstrators said they were concerned about further leadership shake-ups at the Smithsonian as Trump has pushed out agency heads at cultural institutions.', '“We’re all worried for a lot of things, including for Secretary Bunch,” said John Jacob, curator of photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.', 'Yael Gen, a former exhibit designer at the National Museum of Asian Art, said that after Trump’s dismissal of Carla Hayden as librarian of Congress, “I think anybody is up for grabs.”', 'Among the agenda items listed for Monday’s closed-door executive session of the Board of Regents were the Smithsonian’s operating environment and “confidential” personnel matters.', 'With their presence on Monday, demonstrators said, they hoped to stress their support for the institution, without placing any political assertions or pressure on regents.', '“What I want [the regents] to know is that the decisions they’re making are really big decisions and can change the direction of the institution in a really negative way,” Gen said.', 'Last month, on the same day of Trump’s announcement about Sajet, Bunch informed staff that the White House provided new details of proposed cuts to the institute’s budget. The request to Congress proposed a 12 percent reduction of the Smithsonian Institution’s budget and eliminated funding for its Anacostia Community Museum and its forthcoming National Museum of the American Latino, Bunch said in an email obtained by The Post.', 'The developments are the latest among ongoing efforts by the White House to overhaul the country’s most prominent arts and cultural institutions.', 'The White House, in recent months, has slashed staff and federal grants at the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts to fund Trump’s proposed patriotic statuary garden and celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. In February, weeks after returning to office, the president fired board members at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and installed his allies. The board then elected Trump as its new chair.', 'And the following month, he signed an executive order, which calls for the removal of “anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian and aims to “restore” the institution “to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.”', 'Responding to the order, Bunch sent a memo to Smithsonian employees that said he would work “as we have done throughout our history” with the Board of Regents.', '“We remain steadfast in our mission to bring history, science, education, research, and the arts to all Americans,” he wrote. “We will continue to showcase world-class exhibits, collections and objects, rooted in expertise and accuracy.”', 'Across the National Mall and hours after the demonstration on Monday, Raven, the artist cited by the White House, set up visual aids for a 1 p.m. news conference attended only by a reporter for The Post.', 'He had a large flipbook of historic news stories about the Smithsonian, and a human-sized reproduction of the cover of his memoir, “Odious and Cerberus,” which depicted Raven climbing the steps of the Smithsonian’s Reynolds building holding his painting of Trump in one hand, and chains and spikes in the other. Raven, a statuesque man with a long white beard, was dressed in all-white linen, a straw hat and a cross pendant made of nails.', '“I think [the regents] will compel Sajet to resign today,” Raven said. “They have to make that decision, and I think they will do it in a way to preserve the funds.”', 'Sajet’s resignation or dismissal, Raven said, could help him in his years-long quest to get the museum to accept his 16-foot portrait of Trump, titled “Unafraid and Unashamed.”', '“I was really encouraged by” the White House citing his story, Raven said, though he is no longer a Trump supporter, having grown disillusioned with the president after the events of Jan. 6, 2021. “Because I know that there’s a lot of people now in the government who know the story.”']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXJiMkZvUmw5WGRpMVpUUzEyVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Smithsonian rejects Trump’s attempt to fire National Portrait Gallery director,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-09/smithsonian-institution-trump-order-fire-national-portrait-gallery-director,"['The Smithsonian Institution asserted its independence Monday evening in a statement that could be read as a rejection of President Trump’s late-May firing of National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet.', 'The Smithsonian’s statement said the organization’s secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, “has the support of the Board of Regents in his authority and management of the Smithsonian.” The statement suggested that all personnel decisions will be made by Bunch, not Trump.', 'The announcement came after a much-anticipated Board of Regents meeting to discuss the fate of Sajet. The Washington Post had reported that Sajet quietly continued to show up for work each day after Trump’s social media post, which said he was firing Sajet for being “a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI.”', 'The Smithsonian’s statement Monday did not explicitly state that Sajet would remain in her position, and the institution did not respond to a Times question on that subject. But the text of the statement is clear in its intent, beginning: “In 1846, the Smithsonian was established by Congress as an independent entity.”', 'It continues: “Throughout its history, the Smithsonian has been governed and administered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary. The board is entrusted with the governance and independence of the Institution, and the board appoints a Secretary to manage the Institution.”', 'The Smithsonian’s move comes shortly after the White House proposed a 12% reduction in funding to the Smithsonian in the 2026 budget — including the elimination of funding for the National Museum of the American Latino, which is in the development stages and aims to open on or near the National Mall; and the Anacostia Community Museum, which opened in 1967 and honors Black culture.', 'The Smithsonian became a target for Trump beginning March 27, when he issued an executive order titled “Restoring truth and sanity to American history.” That order demanded an end to federal funding for exhibitions and programs based on racial themes that “divide Americans.”', '“Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” the order read. It also instructed Vice President JD Vance to remove “improper ideology” from the Smithsonian’s 21 museums and the National Zoo in Washington.', 'The order followed Trump’s ongoing attempts to reshape federal cultural institutions, including his February takeover of the Kennedy Center.', 'One major difference between the Kennedy Center and the Smithsonian: The Kennedy Center’s board is appointed by the president, but the Smithsonian’s board consists of officials representing all three branches of government. Vance is on the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, as is Chief Justice John G. Roberts.', '“Since its inception, the Smithsonian has set out to be a nonpartisan institution,” the statement Monday read. “As the nation’s museum, the Smithsonian must be a welcoming place of knowledge and discovery for all Americans. The Board of Regents is committed to ensuring that the Smithsonian is a beacon of scholarship free from political or partisan influence, and we recognize that our institution can and must do more to further these foundational values.', '“To reinforce our nonpartisan stature, the Board of Regents has directed the Secretary to articulate specific expectations to museum directors and staff regarding content in Smithsonian museums, give directors reasonable time to make any needed changes to ensure unbiased content, and to report back to the Board on progress and any needed personnel changes based on success or lack thereof in making the needed changes.”', 'The biggest entertainment stories', 'Get our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', '', 'Jessica Gelt is an arts and culture writer for the Los Angeles Times.', 'CALIFORNIA', 'ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS', 'MOVIES', 'MUSIC', 'AWARDS', 'Subscribe for unlimited access\nSite Map', 'Follow Us', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXJiMkZvUmw5WGRpMVpUUzEyVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

"Defying Trump’s firing, Smithsonian says it controls personnel decisions",https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/defying-trumps-firing-smithsonian-says-it-controls-personnel-decisions/,"['In a challenge to President Donald Trump, the Smithsonian said Monday that it retained the power over personnel decisions, a statement that came in the wake of the president’s announcement that he was firing Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery.', '“All personnel decisions are made by and subject to the direction of the secretary, with oversight by the board,” said a statement from the Smithsonian, which oversees that museum and 20 others, as well as libraries, research centers and the National Zoo. “Lonnie G. Bunch, the secretary, has the support of the Board of Regents in his authority and management of the Smithsonian.”', 'The statement came hours after the Board of Regents, including Vice President JD Vance, discussed the president’s announcement at a quarterly meeting. When Trump said 10 days ago that he had fired Sajet, he called her “a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position.”', 'The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Sajet was not mentioned in the Smithsonian’s statement. But the board said it was asking Bunch to take steps to ensure the institution’s nonpartisan nature.', '“The Smithsonian must be a welcoming place of knowledge and discovery for all Americans,” the statement said. “The Board of Regents is committed to ensuring that the Smithsonian is a beacon of scholarship free from political or partisan influence, and we recognize that our institution can and must do more to further these foundational values.”', '', 'The statement said the board had directed Bunch to articulate expectations to museum directors about what is displayed in their institutions and to give them time to make any changes needed “to ensure unbiased content.”', '“This is an interim measure and does not rule out potential personnel actions,” a Smithsonian spokesperson said in an email.', 'Since Trump retook office in January, his administration has made a concerted effort to exert influence over cultural matters in Washington. The president is now chair of the board at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where an ally has taken over as the interim director.', 'And in a recent executive order, Trump called on Vance to overhaul the Smithsonian with the help of Congress. In his order, the president described a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”', 'Trump’s announcement that he had fired Sajet referred to her support of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The White House also provided to The New York Times a list of grievances that it says led to the president’s action, outlining what it described as Sajet’s acts of partisanship and public comments about racial and gender inequality in America.', 'In an email to Smithsonian employees on Monday night, Bunch wrote that he wanted the “institution to look at the unvarnished self” by examining its exhibitions, programs and presentations.', '“While the vast majority of our content is rooted in meticulous research and thoughtful analysis of history and facts, we recognize that, on occasion, some of our work has not aligned with our institutional values of scholarship, even-handedness and nonpartisanship,” he wrote, without providing any specific examples. “For that, we must all work to do better.”', 'Before thanking the president and Congress for their commitment to the Smithsonian, Bunch added that he would evaluate “the need for any changes to policies, procedures or personnel.”', 'Sajet has not responded to requests for comment since Trump’s announcement, but other museum professionals have defended her programming at the National Portrait Gallery as being in line with an effort to expand the portfolio of whose histories are exhibited there.', 'The Smithsonian has long operated as independent of the executive branch, and the legal authority of the president to fire Sajet is questionable, according to the institution’s governing documents. The Board of Regents met last week and again Monday, when the panel voted to restate its autonomy in operating the cultural complex.', 'The fight over Sajet’s tenure has further complicated matters for Bunch, who was already under pressure to navigate a recognition of presidential power while defending the institution’s autonomy. Created by Congress as a trust to be administered by the board and the secretary, the institution receives two-thirds of its $1 billion in annual funding from the federal government.', 'The Smithsonian’s silence after Trump’s announcement about Sajet, the first woman to lead the National Portrait Gallery, appeared to signal a reluctance to challenge the president. But the board on Monday reacted in a way that, if not a complete statement of support for Sajet, was a clear effort by the institution to reassert its autonomy.', 'Bunch’s own standing remains at some risk, given the president’s interest in directing matters at the Smithsonian and his aversion to diversity and inclusion efforts. Appointed secretary by the Smithsonian board during Trump’s first term, Bunch made his reputation as the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, whose exhibits include a review of the country’s legacy of slavery.', 'In April, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, told the Times: “Lonnie Bunch is a Democrat donor and rabid partisan who manufactured lies out of thin air in order to boost sales of his miserable book. Fortunately, he, along with his garbage book, are complete failures.”', 'Rep. Joe Morelle, the leading Democrat on the House Administration Committee, and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, have argued for the Smithsonian’s independence. In a statement, they have disputed Trump’s power to fire employees of the Smithsonian, calling any such effort “illegal.”', 'The Smithsonian is governed by a 17-member Board of Regents, which includes three members of Congress appointed by the House and three by the Senate. Nine regents are nominated by the board and appointed for a six-year term by a joint resolution signed by the president. The vice president and chief justice of the United States also serve on the board.', 'Independent of any personnel maneuvers, the Smithsonian is also confronting the president’s proposed 12% cut to its budget. The proposed cuts were a focal point of a meeting Sajet convened last Tuesday afternoon with the National Portrait Gallery’s board of commissioners. At the meeting, Sajet depicted Trump’s decision to fire her as part of the White House’s broader efforts to target the Smithsonian.', 'The proposed budget cuts would affect other museums under the Smithsonian’s umbrella, such as the planned National Museum of the American Latino, she said, which would need to reduce its staff from 35 employees to about six people. The Anacostia Community Museum would completely lose its funding, she added, and its programming would be folded into the National Museum of African American History and Culture.', '“The big hit is to facilities,” Sajet said in a video conference call with commissioners. She explained that such budget reductions would hit the Smithsonian’s infrastructure the hardest. “That’s maintaining our museums, storage, upgrades and, you know, all the care that goes into it.”', 'At the meeting, Sajet indicated that she viewed her own situation as collateral damage in the president’s effort to reshape the Smithsonian. “I was just a piece of it,” she said.', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXJiMkZvUmw5WGRpMVpUUzEyVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
,https://www.thebulwark.com/p/why-is-trump-trying-to-fire-this-museum-director-smithsonian-national-portrait-gallery-kim-sajet,"['DONALD TRUMP’S ANNOUNCEMENT in a May 30 Truth Social post that he had fired the director of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, on the grounds of supposed partisanship and commitment to “DEI”—diversity, equity, and inclusion—has been the latest salvo in his fight to remake America’s elite cultural institutions. But this time, the attack has foundered, as Trump lacks the legal authority to dismiss Sajet or hire her replacement—although you can bet that administration lawyers are looking for legal theories to legitimize Trump’s action, or applying pressure on those actually empowered to fire her', 'So far, Sajet, a 60-year-old Dutch art historian with a long career in American and Australian art museums who became the National Portrait Gallery’s first female director in 2013, is reportedly still at her desk. The gallery’s website still lists her as director, and its press releases give no inkling of any turmoil at the museum. The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, of which the gallery is a part—and to which the task of hiring its directors is by law reserved—held an emergency meeting this past Monday to discuss the situation; one of its four regular annual in-person meetings is scheduled for Monday of next week. For now, everyone at the Smithsonian and at the National Portrait Gallery is maintaining a media silence. (Queries from The Bulwark have gone unanswered.)', 'While the Smithsonian was created by Congress, gets two-thirds of its funding from the federal government, and has such a close relationship with the government that it enjoys certain kinds of legal special treatment, it is not an executive branch agency. (The seventeen-person Board of Regents always includes, by law, several members of Congress, the vice president, and the chief justice of the United States, who by tradition is usually elected chancellor of the Smithsonian.) As is inevitable in a museum as large as the Smithsonian and covering the subjects that it does, it has faced political controversies and pressures through the years. However, as Philip Kennicott points out, if Trump succeeds in ousting Sajet, this would drastically change the institution’s status: all of the content and personnel decisions in its nineteen museums—seventeen in Washington, D.C. and two in New York—would fall directly under White House control.', 'But leaving aside the issue of legal authority, there’s also the question of Kulturkampf: What’s really driving Trump’s “war on woke” in cultural institutions and what is it meant to accomplish? Right-wing critics have portrayed Sajet as an ideologue who, according to New Criterion executive editor James Panero, has “shown contempt for the National Portrait Gallery’s collection” and focused on “politicized exhibitions.” The White House, meanwhile, has been touting a list of seventeen alleged transgressions by Sajet, from donations to Democratic politicians to past comments in favor of broader racial and cultural representation in art.', 'But while Sajet’s public statements and her stewardship of the gallery certainly suggest she shares the progressive sensibilities that tend to be standard in the art world, they also show that she is very far from being a militant ideologue or hostile to the gallery’s collection. Are some of her choices and policies open to reasonable criticism? Of course. But much of the right-wing criticism directed at Sajet is far more ideological and intolerant than any of the offenses imputed to her—particularly considering that those offenses include an entirely accurate label for a portrait of Donald Trump.', 'Share', 'LET’S START WITH THAT LABEL, which various sources quote as follows:', 'Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837–1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.', 'The White House apparently thinks this text exposes the blatant hypocrisy of Sajet’s statement that “we try very much not to editorialize” and that the labels in the gallery’s American Presidents permanent exhibition should be based on “historical fact,” not the “curator’s opinion.” But where’s the lie? The above quote is solidly based on historical fact. Moreover, it’s also not the entirety of the label, which The Guardian has described as “delicately crafted.” The supposedly incendiary part is preceded by a remarkably—you could even say, undeservedly—positive writeup:', 'After a long career in business and television, Donald J. Trump overcame a crowded primary field to win the Republican Party’s nomination and the 2016 election. His campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again” (MAGA), has come to signify his supporters and his political agenda.', 'During his first term, Trump appointed a record number of federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices. He brokered a series of agreements between Israel and several Arab nations, focused on immigration policy, and reduced government regulations. He also promoted the development of COVID-19 vaccines while making economic prosperity a key priority.', 'If anything, I’d say the gallery was bending over backwards not to editorialize, with the effect of making Trump seem far more normal than he is. (Even a purely factual summary could have been far worse: There’s no mention, for instance, of the fact that Trump is the first U.S. president to have been convicted of a felony or found civilly liable for sexual assault.) For what it’s worth, the National Portrait Gallery label for Bill Clinton also acknowledges his impeachment for denying his sexual relationship with an intern while under oath. One could quibble with some of the other labels—read them for yourself—but overall, they simply don’t show the blatant bias Sajet’s detractors claim.', 'Keep up with all our coverage of Trump’s attacks on cultural institutions and universities—join Bulwark+ today:', 'What about Sajet’s supposed excessive commitment to diversity? She has drawn fire for a policy requiring, in her own words, that “50 percent of all the funds we would spend should go to a minority subject or artist,” a definition that apparently includes women. While such decisions don’t constitute illegal discrimination, quotas are always counterproductive.', 'Sajet has made no secret of her commitment to countering the image of the National Portrait Gallery as a showcase for “the wealthy, the pale and the male.” But while this phrase may have fit the gallery’s early years—of the 161 portrait subjects in its 1968 opening exhibition, all but eight were men and all but eight were white—it had already come a long way from those stodgy beginnings well before Sajet’s tenure. Its 2007–08 exhibitions included four eighteenth-century portraits of Native American leaders, twentieth-century photographs of notable American women, and a tribute to hip-hop.', 'Did Sajet’s efforts to amount an overcorrection? Many of her “diverse” projects would raise no eyebrows except in the truly fetid corners of far-right Twitter: for instance, the 2020 “Votes for Women” exhibition on the suffrage movement, or the 2019–20 tribute to black singer and civil rights icon Marian Anderson. Others sound ill-conceived: for instance, much of the 2015–22 series of social justice-focused performance art events, Identify, seems heavy-handed or gimmicky. (That said: we’re talking about a total of eleven events spread out over seven years.) One may also deplore lapses into grating left-coded academic or activist jargon of the sort that refers to people from traditionally disenfranchised groups as “bodies.”', 'On the other hand, some of the attacks on Sajet either attribute a nefarious radicalism to even the most moderate acknowledgments of the darker aspects of American history (e.g., her remark at the 2018 Atlantic festival that “the ‘portrait of America’ has never been only about meritocracy but also social access, racial inequality, gender difference, religious preference and political power”) or plainly misrepresent the content at the gallery. Thus, the New Criterion’s Panero claims that the 2018–19 exhibition Unseen, featuring work by two artists critiquing the treatment (or exclusion) of race in traditional American portraiture, “depict[s] the symbolic destruction of historical portraits in the permanent collection” and thus demonstrates Sajet’s scorn for the museum’s historical fare.', 'Unseen was certainly a politically charged exhibition, although some of its messages—e.g., subverting mythologized or idealized notions of Thomas Jefferson or Christopher Columbus—were arguably pretty cliché by 2019. But the painting by Titus Kaphar in which a curtain with a famous Jefferson portrait is pulled back to reveal an image of a presumably enslaved black woman is actually quite striking, and it doesn’t depict the “destruction” of anything. (If Panero is referring to a partly sliced-up image of Andrew Jackson—another work by Kaphar—that image recreates a portrait installed in the Oval Office during Trump’s first term, apparently not a painting in the National Portrait Gallery collection.) Other parts of the exhibition juxtaposed busts and life masks of people from American and European elites with busts of African Americans and Native Americans in a way that conveyed equal humanity, not destruction.', 'Share', 'More importantly: One doesn’t have to like Unseen (which was underwritten by private foundation grants). But to suggest that it did not deserve a place in the National Portrait Gallery smacks of—say it with me—cancel culture. The backlash would be understandable if Sajet really had declared war on the gallery’s regular collection and filled most of the available space with “subversive” and activist progressive art. She has not.', 'A look at current and past exhibitions under Sajet’s tenure shows such subjects as antebellum portraits of West Point cadets; “namesakes” of Washington, D.C. streets and avenues; Abraham Lincoln’s contemporaries; early daguerreotype photos; charcoal portraits by John Singer Sargent; and tributes to the lives and careers of such varied American figures as Will Rogers, Sylvia Plath, Arnold Palmer, Nancy Reagan, Babe Ruth, John McCain, and Tom Wolfe. The ongoing exhibition Out of Many: Portraits from 1600 to 1900 still offers a reassuringly old-fashioned gallery of painting, busts, and nineteenth-century photographs of men and women as varied as Benjamin Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Louisa May Alcott, Julia Ward Howe, and Thomas Edison—along with lesser-known but fascinating figures such as eighteenth-century revolutionary gazetteer Anne Catherine Hoof Green and nineteenth-century American-British black actor and playwright Ira Aldridge. There’s also a four-year loan, running from 2023 to 2027, of a life-size 1865 painting of Abraham Lincoln by W.F.K. Travers. When the installation was announced, Sajet spoke enthusiastically of “reunit[ing] the Travers painting with Gilbert Stuart’s Lansdowne portrait of George Washington” with which it was displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.', 'In other words, the gallery’s traditional content is still very much alive, well, and treated with respect and affection, not contempt.', 'And if one may quibble with some of its more political content in recent years, some of the charges levied against Sajet by the right are far more blatantly and ham-fistedly political—for instance, the complaint about the gallery’s display of Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger. Some of Sanger’s views, such as support for the sterilization of people with mental disabilities, are today rightly considered repugnant, but she was a complex and important figure in American history.', 'Last but not least: Also on the White House’s list of seventeen supposed offenses Sajet has committed is “a social media post praising Anthony Fauci,” honored at the National Portrait Gallery in 2022.', 'WE STILL DON’T KNOW EXACTLY WHY Trump decided to sack Sajet. His Truth Social post referred to acting “upon the request and recommendation of many people.” Sajet’s name may have been the first suggested for the chopping block by Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former defense attorney whom he has made a special assistant tasked with sniffing out “improper ideology” in the Smithsonian. Sajet may have been in the sights of right-wing militants who saw her a symbol of the pervasive “woke” dominance in cultural institutions, a dominance many on the right see as so insidious that it must be broken up by government muscle.', 'It’s also entirely possible that the real issue was just the label on the Trump portrait—which would be very much in line with Trump’s ego-obsessed, vindictive, petty narcissism.', 'As with the rest of Trump’s self-serving anti-DEI crusade, looking for valid points in the charges leveled against Sajet is irrelevant: The real point is the power grab. Which is why, even if progressive culture can produce its own variants of conformity, everyone who values artistic freedom should be standing with Kim Sajet right now—and hoping that the gallery won’t join the ranks of institutions that have caved to Trump. Otherwise, we may end up with a National Portrait Gallery where the text label that comes with Trump’s portrait will simply say, “GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.”', 'Zip this article to a friend or zip it up onto social media:', 'Share', '', 'Ready for more?']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXJiMkZvUmw5WGRpMVpUUzEyVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet remains at work despite Trump criticism,https://www.postguam.com/news/nation/national-portrait-gallery-director-kim-sajet-remains-at-work-despite-trump-criticism/article_fadd297a-4c22-4656-9f28-9bdcc0bbdd67.html,"['', '', 'GALLERY: The “America’s Presidents” gallery is shown at the National Portrait Gallery on April 1. Chloe Coleman/The Washington Post', 'President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to assert control over an elite American cultural institution has turned into a high-stakes Washington standoff.', 'In defiance of Trump’s announcement last Friday that he was firing her, Kim Sajet - the director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery - has continued reporting for work, conducting meetings and handling other museum business as she did before, according to several people familiar with her activities who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.', 'Writing on Truth Social, Trump declared he was firing Sajet because she “is a highly partisan person” and “a strong supporter of DEI,” a reference to diversity, equity and inclusion. He said her replacement would be named shortly.', 'Trump has not provided legal reasoning to support his authority to fire Sajet. Top congressional Democrats have asserted the president does not have the legal authority to remove her.', 'Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., a member of the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, said on Wednesday the board had requested more information and “will discuss the issue further” at its scheduled meeting on Monday.', 'The president has no authority', '“We just need more information about her performance, and some of the allegations that were made, so we can make an informed, thoughtful decision,” Peters said. “Clearly, the president has no authority whatsoever to fire her. The Smithsonian is an independent institution, and the director of the Smithsonian is the one who she reports to and that’s the person who makes the decision as to hiring and firing of individuals.”', 'In a joint statement, House Administration Committee ranking Democrat Joseph Morelle of New York and House Appropriations Committee ranking Democrat Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said: “President Trump has no authority to fire employees of the Smithsonian Institution - including the Director of the National Portrait Gallery. The dismissal of Director Sajet is unacceptable and has the same legal weight as the President’s prior attempts to undermine the Smithsonian’s independence: absolutely none. Should the White House require a copy of the Constitution, we would be more than happy to provide one.”', 'Sajet’s refusal to abide by Trump’s decision sets up a test of the bounds of presidential authority over the Smithsonian, a sprawling complex of 21 museums, 14 education and research centers and the National Zoo. It is not a traditional government agency or part of the executive branch, and hiring and firing decisions have historically been handled by the Smithsonian’s secretary, rather than its Board of Regents. The Smithsonian’s current secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch III, is expected to address the president’s attempt to oust Sajet at Monday’s board meeting.', 'In an only-in-Washington twist, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. - who has handled major questions at the Supreme Court regarding the limits of presidential power since Trump took office - is chancellor of the Smithsonian and a member of its board.', 'A Trump White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Smithsonian spokesperson declined to comment.', 'The Kennedy Center', 'In February, Trump made another foray into American arts when he took control of the Kennedy Center, dismissing his predecessor’s appointees to its board. They then installed him as chairman and replaced the institution’s director with a political ally who has limited experience in the arts. The Smithsonian differs from the Kennedy Center because presidents do not appoint members to its board, which is composed of officials from all three branches of government and members of the public. But Trump is not without allies on the Smithsonian board, including Vice President JD Vance, who, like Roberts, is an ex officio member.', 'Trump’s move against Sajet follows an executive order issued on March 27 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which aims to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” A 35-year-old special assistant and senior associate staff secretary, Lindsey Halligan, was among the order’s architects - inspired in part by her early-2025 visit to “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,” an exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which shares a building with the Portrait Gallery.', 'The order calls for Halligan and Vice President JD Vance to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian and “prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race.”', '“President Trump’s attempt to fire the National Portrait Gallery Director is outrageous and represents yet another disturbing example of his relentless effort to control American art and culture,” said Rep. Chellie Pingree, Maine, the ranking Democrat on the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees the Smithsonian, in a statement. “Despite what the President may think, America’s cultural institutions are not run by dictatorial impulses.”', 'Critical of Trump', 'On Tuesday, a White House official provided The Post a list of 17 instances in which, the White House argued, Sajet was critical of Trump or outspoken about her support for diversity, equity and inclusion. The list included her donations to Democratic politicians and advocacy groups; a social media post praising Anthony S. Fauci; the caption for the museum’s presidential portrait of Trump mentioning his two impeachments and “incitement of insurrection” for the events of Jan. 6, 2021; and numerous quotes from interviews in a variety of publications about her efforts to represent a broad swath of Americans within the gallery’s walls.', 'One item on the list was a quote in a 2019 USA Today story about Black artists demanding representation in American artistic institutions: “We owe it to Americans to reflect them because we owe it to accurate history,” Sajet says. “I’m not interested in only having a museum for some people.”', 'The list also cited remarks Sajet has made in support of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, her criticism of Columbus Day and her rejection of one artist’s 2016 portrait of Trump as “too political.” It noted that Sajet had commissioned artworks about Mexican immigration and “the complications of ancestral and racial history.” It also criticized her 2013 decision to spend “50% of all money spent on art” to “support diverse artists and portrait subjects.”', 'Since its founding 179 years ago, the Smithsonian - which receives about 60% of its budget from federal appropriations and grants - has generally operated independently, though there have been controversies in which museums altered exhibitions in response to political pressure. Museum directors such as Sajet - holders of some of the most prestigious posts in American arts - are not paid with federal funds, but through the Smithsonian’s trust fund.', 'Hours after Trump’s post, Bunch told Smithsonian staff in an email obtained by The Washington Post that the White House also sent new details of proposed budget cuts, including a 12% reduction and the exclusion of funding for the Anacostia Community Museum and the forthcoming National Museum of the American Latino.', 'On Saturday, at the Portrait Gallery and SAAM’s joint family Pride celebration, a trio of visitors strolled through the central courtyard in neon vests that read “Hands off the arts” - closely monitored by a Smithsonian staff member nearby.', '“I’m outraged” by Sajet’s firing, said Karen Nussbaum, 75, of Washington. “There’s a place for a political expression in art, but not political control of art.”', '“I think the next step is controlling what artists think and do,” said Cynthia Cain, 60, of Washington, “and that’s not acceptable.”', '', 'Poll results are published every Monday in The Guam Daily Post.', '', 'Learn more about your privacy options', '', '', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXJiMkZvUmw5WGRpMVpUUzEyVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
