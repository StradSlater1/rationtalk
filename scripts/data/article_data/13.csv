The federal funding that supports local stations and public media is under threat.', '', 'Seung Min Kim, Associated Press', 'Kirsten Grieshaber, Associated Press', 'Geir Moulson, Associated Press', 'Leave your feedback', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace.', 'Watch in our video player above.', 'In an Oval Office meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump likened the war in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in early 2022 — to a fight between two young children who hated each other.', 'READ MORE: Trump says Putin told him Russia will respond to Ukrainian drone attack on airfields', '“Sometimes you’re better off letting them a fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” Trump said. He added that he had relayed that analogy to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their phone conversation on Wednesday.', '', 'Asked about Trump’s comments as the two leaders sat next to each other, Merz stressed that both he and Trump agreed “on this war and how terrible this war is going on,” pointing to the U.S. president as the “key person in the world” who would be able to stop the bloodshed.', 'But Merz also emphasized that Germany “was on the side of Ukraine” and that Kyiv was only attacking military targets, not Russian civilians.', 'READ MORE: Zelenskyy asks Western allies to boost air defense deliveries as Hegseth skips Ukraine meeting', '“We are trying to get them stronger,” Merz said of Ukraine.', 'Thursday’s meeting marked the first time that the two leaders sat down in person. After exchanging pleasantries — Merz gave Trump a gold-framed birth certificate of the U.S president’s grandfather Friedrich Trump, who immigrated from Germany — the two leaders were to discuss issues such as Ukraine, trade and NATO spending.', 'Trump and Merz have spoken several times by phone, either bilaterally or with other European leaders, since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a “decent” relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump’s relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in the Republican president’s first term.', 'READ MORE: Germany offers to help Ukraine develop long-range missiles to strike Russia', 'The 69-year-old Merz — who came to office with an extensive business background — is a conservative former rival of Merkel’s who took over her party after she retired from politics.', 'A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany’s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called “democratic backsliding,” saying the administration’s view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.', 'But Merz told reporters Thursday morning that if Trump wanted to talk German domestic politics, he was ready to do that but he also stressed Germany holds back when it comes to American domestic politics.', 'READ MORE: Zelenskyy wants face-to-face talks with Putin. Putin says there’s nothing to talk about after Ukraine’s attacks', 'Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.', 'In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”', 'Under Merz’s immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits.', 'WATCH: As Germany selects a new conservative chancellor, a look at the challenges he inherits', 'In his remarks on Thursday, Trump still left the threat of sanctions on the table. He said sanctions could be imposed for both Ukraine and Russia.', '“When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop … we’ll be very, very tough,” Trump said.', 'At home, Merz’s government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump’s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies.', 'The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark.', 'WATCH: German voters shift substantially to the right in landmark election', 'Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany’s armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027.', 'Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.', 'Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany’s economy, Europe’s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump’s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.', 'Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.', '“Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told reporters Thursday morning. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.”', 'The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.', 'Trump’s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.', 'There’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month.', 'One source of strain in recent months is a speech Vice President JD Vance gave in Munich shortly before Germany’s election in February, in which he lectured European leaders about the state of democracy on the continent and said there is no place for “firewalls.”', 'That term is frequently used to describe mainstream German parties’ refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished second in the election and is now the biggest opposition party.', 'Merz criticized the comments. He told ARD television last month that it isn’t the place of a U.S. vice president “to say something like that to us in Germany; I wouldn’t do it in America, either.”', 'Moulson reported from Berlin.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.', 'But Merz told reporters Thursday morning that if Trump wanted to talk German domestic politics, he was ready to do that but he also stressed Germany holds back when it comes to American domestic politics.', 'Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of “dictated peace” or the “subjugation” of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.', 'In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that “it is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.”', ""Under Merz's immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits."", 'In his remarks on Thursday, Trump still left the threat of sanctions on the table. He said sanctions could be imposed for both Ukraine and Russia.', '“When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop ... we’ll be very, very tough,” Trump said.', ""At home, Merz's government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump's first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies."", 'The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark.', ""Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany's armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027."", 'Merz has said that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.” He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.', ""Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a “locomotive of growth,” but Trump's tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025."", 'Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.', '“Germany is one of the very big investors in America,” Merz told reporters Thursday morning. “Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.”', 'The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.', 'Trump’s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.', 'There’s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs “benefit no one and damage everyone” while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union’s executive commission. Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month.', ""One source of strain in recent months is a speech Vice President JD Vance gave in Munich shortly before Germany's election in February, in which he lectured European leaders about the state of democracy on the continent and said there is no place for “firewalls.”"", ""That term is frequently used to describe mainstream German parties' refusal to work with the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished second in the election and is now the biggest opposition party."", ""Merz criticized the comments.

Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds. Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”', 'Trump blamed the war — not on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion — but on ‘hate’ between the two parties, suggesting both are to blame for the war stretching into its fourth year, with casualties on both sides exceeding one million. “There’s a great hatred between those two, between those two men, but between the warring parties, great hatred.”', '“I gave that analogy to Putin,” Trump said, referring to his two-hour-plus Wednesday phone call with the Russian leader. “I said, ‘President, maybe you’re going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot,’ because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart.', '“It’s a pretty known analogy,” Trump said. “You have two kids, they fight, fight, fight. Sometimes, you let them fight for a little while.”', 'TRUMP: ‘BETTER OFF’ LETTING PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY FIGHT BEFORE PULLING THEM APART', 'NOT TIME FOR SANCTIONS: While Trump expressed frustration with his inability to deliver on his promise to end the war quickly, he again cut Putin slack as Russian forces continued to rain hundreds of missiles and drones on Ukraine on a nightly basis, targeting almost exclusively the civilian population in cities, with apartment buildings being a favorite target.', 'Last night was no exception, with at least six regions across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv, targeted with more than 440 drones and missiles in one of Russia’s largest coordinated attacks of the war.', 'Trump says he has in mind when it might be time to “get tough” and perhaps impose sanctions. “Yeah. It’s in my brain, the deadline. When I see the moment where it’s not going to stop,” Trump said, again appearing to blame Ukraine for its dogged defense of its freedom and sovereignty. “We’ll be very, very, very tough. And it could be on both countries, to be honest,” he said. “You know, it takes two to tango. We’re going to be very tough whether it’s Russia or anybody else, we’re going to be very tough. That’s a bloodbath that’s going on over there.”', 'The latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War concluded that “the Kremlin continues efforts to falsely portray Russia as willing to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, despite Russia’s repeated refusal to offer any concessions.” It also noted, “Russian forces are reportedly sustaining an average of 1,140 casualties per day and suffering disproportionately high personnel casualties for marginal, grinding territorial gains.”', 'RUSSIA LAUNCHES AIRSTRIKE ON UKRAINE WITH ‘OVER 400 DRONES AND MORE THAN 40 MISSILES’', 'SCHUMER: ‘WHY IS HE ACTING LIKE A BYSTANDER?’: Frustrated by Trump’s attempts to stall a tough new sanctions bill that enjoys a veto-proof majority in the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor to excoriate Trump for his inaction.', '“Why is he acting like a bystander?” Schumer said. “Instead, Donald Trump is busy announcing Putin’s military plans like a press secretary …He’s the President of the United States. Donald Trump should show some backbone.”', 'Trump insisted he did implore Putin to exercise restraint but blamed Ukraine for provoking Putin with its “Spiderweb” sneak attack that humiliated Russia on its own turf. “They attacked pretty harshly. They went deep into Russia,” Trump said. “I said, ‘Don’t do it. You shouldn’t do it. You should stop it.’ But, again, there’s a lot of hatred.”', '“He said that we have no choice but to attack based on that and it’s probably not going to be pretty. I don’t like it.”', '“Here’s what President Trump should have said to Vladimir Putin. He should’ve said, ‘Vladimir Putin, end this war now. Stop killing Ukrainian civilians. Stop your illegal invasion,’” Schumer said. ', '“Here’s what the president needs to do: His administration has the power to help Ukraine defend itself with air defense systems, specifically ammunition for its Patriot systems that the U.S. or our European allies can provide,” Schumer said. “Ukraine has said these air defense systems are the best tools for protecting civilian life from Russian missile strikes. We have to do all we can to get them these very needed air defense systems ASAP.”', 'UKRAINE’S ‘SPIDERWEB’ SNEAK ATTACK OFFERS LESSONS FOR US AND RUSSIA', 'Good Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie.

Many agreed. He clearly had not met enough Americans.”', 'Hegseth read from Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s 1944 “Order of the Day,” reminding the troops of what was at stake.', '“You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hope and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.”', 'Hegseth said he was inspired by the bravery of the World War II generation and spent the morning working out with U.S. Army Rangers on Omaha Beach, where American troops went ashore 81 years ago.', '“As we ran on that beach this morning at 6:30, as the sun was rising about the same time those first landing crafts landed, it didn’t look much like the battlefield. It looked like a beach. I ran over more than a few sandcastles,” he said “That’s what those men fought for, that we may turn scenes of death into scenes of life.”', 'HEGSETH SAYS NATO ‘NEAR CONSENSUS’ ON 5% DEFENSE SPENDING', 'MERZ’S D-DAY MOMENT: The contrast between America’s resolve to liberate Europe in 1944 and President Trump’s insistence that Russia’s war of aggression against freedom-loving Ukraine is primary Europe’s problem, was not lost on German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met with Trump in the Oval Office yesterday.', 'Merz knew the drill. He would sit next to Trump while the president held court with reporters and wait for the few times he could make a point or two. Merz also knew he was supposed to show up with a gift and came bearing a gold-framed copy of the birth certificate of Trump’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who was born in Kallstadt, Germany, in 1869. Trump promised to “put it up in a place of honor.”', 'Merz attempted to use America’s commitment to Europe’s freedom in World War II to urge Trump to do more to end the war in Ukraine. “This is D-Day anniversary, when the Americans once ended a war in Europe,” he began before Trump interrupted.', '“That was not a pleasant day for you,” Trump said. “This was not a great thing.”', '“Well, in the long run, Mr. President, this was the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship,” Merz replied. “So we know what we owe you. But this is the reason why I’m saying that America is again in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war.”', '“So let’s talk about what we can do jointly, and we are ready to do what we can. And you know that we gave support to Ukraine, and that we are looking for more pressure on Russia, the European Union did, and we should talk about that.”', 'When Trump brought up the horrific death suffered by both soldiers and civilians, Merz managed to make the point that only the Russians were deliberately killing innocents. “This is only by Russian weapons against Ukraine. This had never happened with Ukraine weapons against Russia, never,” Merz said. “Ukraine is only targeting military targets, not civilians, not private, not energy infrastructure. So this is the difference, and that’s the reason why we are trying to do more on Russia, how to stop this war.”', 'AIR FORCE: ‘FREE’ AF1 WILL COST LESS THAN $400 MILLION: Democrats have been citing sky-high estimates for the cost of converting the “gift” luxury 747 jetliner from Qatar into an operational Air Force One, some citing figures as high as $1 billion for the “free” plane.', 'But Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told the House Armed Services Committee he expects the bill to be “significant” but less than half of that.', '“It’s probably less than $400 million to retrofit that aircraft,” Mink said, cautioning that many of the upgrades involve the addition of “classified, sensitive capabilities” that he can’t discuss in public. “We’d be happy to come down and talk to you in detail about it in a different environment.”', 'Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) questioned the cost, noting that the delivery of two Boeing Air Force One aircraft bought in 2018 was originally destined for a bankrupt Russian airline. The retrofit projects were also delayed by cost overruns and other problems.', '“And I would just say, based on the experience of the 2018 planes, we know that the contract for retrofit was $3.9 billion. Again, some of that was purchase of the planes from Boeing, roughly about $800 million, but again, if you just do the math, it was about $3 billion for retrofit,” Courtney said. “They had to strip those planes that were built for another purpose down to the studs …  There’s been issues — the contractor who was doing the interior work went out of business, and Boeing has had to kind of figure out a plan to do fitting out of the interior of the plane.”', '“You can’t retrofit a plane that’s built for another purpose for Air Force One and expect it to be a free plane,” Courtney said. “You’ve got to install encrypted communication technology. You have to harden the defenses. You have to put countermeasures in there … It’s a flying situation room.”', '“The sooner we just sort of rip the band-aid off and get that information out there, it would be helpful for us, in terms of deciding whether this is a smart path to go down,” he said.', 'HEGSETH PICKS AIR FORCE THREE-STAR TO LEAD US TROOPS IN EUROPE, NATO FORCES', 'THE RUNDOWN:', 'Washington Examiner: Russia launches airstrike on Ukraine with ‘over 400 drones and more than 40 missiles’', 'Washington Examiner: Trump: ‘Better off’ letting Putin and Zelenskyy fight before pulling them apart', 'Washington Examiner: Ukraine’s ‘Spiderweb’ sneak attack offers lessons for US and Russia', 'Washington Examiner: Hegseth says NATO ‘near consensus’ on 5% defense spending', 'Washington Examiner: Hegseth picks Air Force three-star to lead US troops in Europe, NATO forces', 'Washington Examiner: Pakistani captain found guilty in smuggling case tied to deaths of two Navy SEALs', 'Washington Examiner: DHS cuts contract for significantly delayed cutter, saving $260 million', 'Washington Examiner: Anatomy of a divorce: Trump-Musk relationship fractures in real time on social media', 'Washington Examiner: Israel concerned that Trump NSC, envoy shake-ups signal policy shifts', 'Washington Examiner: France floats ‘concrete steps’ to punish Israel over Gaza', 'Washington Examiner: Trump DHS expedites border wall construction in Arizona and New Mexico', 'Washington Examiner: DHS shutters TSA Quiet Skies Program that let government surveil airline passengers', 'Washington Examiner: Musk says he won’t decommission Dragon spacecraft after X user tells him to ‘cool off', 'Washington Examiner: What to know about the latest Trump travel ban affecting 19 countries', 'Washington Post: Frustration Mounts Over Missing Defense Budget, Lack of Clear Policy', 'SpaceNews: HASC Warns White House Over Delayed Defense Budget, Potential Cuts to Space Force Funding', 'SpaceNews: Senators Unveil Bipartisan Bill to Boost Space Cooperation with Indo-Pacific Allies', 'Inside Defense: MDA cancels Space-Based Interceptor industry event, halting Golden Dome momentum', 'Wall Street Journal: Iran Orders Material From China for Hundreds of Ballistic Missiles', 'Breaking Defense: Eyeing Risk of Radar ‘Delays,’ Lockheed Proposes New F-35 Fuselage Design', 'Breaking Defense: Hypersonics on the Hill: ARRW Back in Air Force Quiver, Army to Seek New Munitions', 'The War Zone: German F-35s Will Be Armed With Stealthy Joint Strike Missiles', 'The War Zone: Plan To Turn Ex-RAF E-3 AWACS Into E-6B ‘Doomsday’ Jet Trainer Abandoned By Navy', 'Washington Post: ICE officers stranded in Djibouti shipping container with deported migrants', 'Air & Space Forces Magazine: What Defense Tech Firms Can Learn From Formula One', 'THE CALENDAR: ', 'FRIDAY | JUNE 6', '9 a.m. — National Institute for Deterrence Studies virtual seminar: “Deterring the New Pacing Threats of Opportunistic and Coordinated Aggression,” with Matt Costlow, senior analyst, National Institute for Public Policy https://thinkdeterrence.com/events/deterring-the-new-pacing-threats', 'TUESDAY | JUNE 10', '9:30 a.m. G-50 Dirksen — Senate Armed Services Committee hearing: “The posture of the Department of the Navy in review of the Defense Authorization Request for FY 2026 and the Future Years Defense Program” http://www.armed-services.senate.gov', '10 a.m. H-140, U.S. Capitol — House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing: “Oversight Hearing — The Department of Defense,” with testimony from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

This in turn led Russia to launch one of the largest barrages of missiles and drones of the war at targets across Ukraine.', 'This does not look like “the 10th yard line of peace.”', 'It was against this backdrop that Trump has apparently come up with a new metaphor. The New York Times reported:', 'As Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, sat beside him watching in silence, President Trump compared Russia and Ukraine to two fighting children who needed to work out their differences for a while before anyone could intervene.', '“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', '“And I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday,” the Republican added. “I said, ‘President, maybe you have to keep fighting and suffering a lot, because both sides are suffering, before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart.’”', 'So, a few things.', 'First, comparing this conflict to a dispute among children on a playground is unhelpful, and Trump complaining about anyone engaging in juvenile behavior is unwise, given everything we know about his temperament and frequent tantrums.', 'Second, the idea that the White House is prepared to let Russia and Ukraine “fight for a while” overlooks the inconvenient fact that they’ve already been fighting for a while. Indeed, Russia invaded Ukraine back in February 2022 — more than three years ago — which Trump described at the time as “genius” and part of a “wonderful” strategy.', 'But let’s also not lose sight of the evolution of the American president’s thinking. Trump’s Plan A for the war in Ukraine was ending the conflict within 24 hours by way of a secret strategy he assured voters was real. When it became obvious that this strategy didn’t actually exist, Trump moved on to Plan B: He told Russia that if it failed to end the conflict quickly, the White House “would have no other choice” but to impose new economic sanctions.', 'When Putin ignored those threats and Trump failed to follow through, the American president floated Plan C (international economic penalties designed to force a ceasefire), Plan D (Trump-backed bilateral talks between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy) and Plan E (bilateral talks between Trump and Putin).', 'Plan F — White House passivity — is now increasingly coming into focus. Trump’s latest plan to end the conflict is apparently to stop trying to end the conflict.', 'This post updates our related earlier coverage.', 'This article was originally published on MSNBC.com']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNURRa2RCYjFsUU1GOHdlakZEVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQklKd2psMm9leFFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

""You see in hockey, you see it in sports.

Merz carefully sidestepped Trump\'s assertions and emphasized that the U.S. and Germany both agree on ""how terrible this war is,"" while making sure to lay blame squarely on Putin for the violence and make the point that Germany was siding with Ukraine.', '""We are both looking for ways to stop it very soon,"" Merz said in the Oval Office.

He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of ""dictated peace"" or the ""subjugation"" of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.', 'On Thursday, Trump also kept the threat of sanctions on the table — but for both Russia and Ukraine.

Trump interjected to the German leader when he referenced D-Day.', ""At home, Merz's government is intensifying a drive that his immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, began to bolster the German military after Russia invaded Ukraine. In Trump's first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies."", 'Ahead of Thursday\'s meeting, a White House official said the administration planned to stress to Germany that it should increase its defense spending and that the upcoming NATO summit in The Netherlands was a good opportunity to commit to Trump\'s 5% pledge. But during an exchange with reporters, Trump praised Berlin: ""I know that you\'re spending more money on defense now and quite a bit more money. That\'s a positive thing.""', ""Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany's armed forces — called the Bundeswehr — which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027. Merz has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure."", 'Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany\'s economy, Europe\'s biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a ""locomotive of growth,"" but Trump\'s tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.', 'Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.', '""Germany is one of the very big investors in America,"" Merz told German reporters Thursday morning ahead of his visit with Trump. ""Only a few countries invest more than Germany in the USA. We are in third place in terms of foreign direct investment.""', ""The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S. Trump's 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles."", 'There\'s only so much Merz can achieve on his view that tariffs ""benefit no one and damage everyone"" while in Washington, as trade negotiations are a matter for the European Union\'s executive commission. Trump hinted at that Thursday, saying the trade situation will mostly depend on the negotiations with the 27-country bloc.', '""We\'ll end up hopefully with a trade deal,"" Trump said.

Trump compares Ukraine-Russia war to kids’ brawl: ‘Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/politics/ukraine-war-trump-kids-fighting,"['', 'For months, President Donald Trump has voiced varying degrees of optimism that he – and only he – will be able to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.', 'But halting progress, ever-more deadly drone attacks and unmoving negotiating positions seem to have taken their toll. On Thursday, Trump used a striking analogy to concede the warfare was nowhere near over, and that he did not, at that moment, feel it was best to intervene.', '“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said in the Oval Office, with his German counterpart Friedrich Merz looking on silently. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', 'In this comparison — which Trump said he delivered directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their 75-minute phone call Wednesday — Trump is acting not as the man in the middle but as a referee letting an altercation play out.', '“You see it in hockey. You see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds,” he said. “Let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”', 'It was a frank admission for Trump, the verbal equivalent of throwing up his hands at a problem he cannot solve.', 'Trump’s evolution — from vowing to end the war in a day to comparing the warring sides to children allowed to spar on a hockey rink — has been, for him, a frustrating one.', 'He has wavered on applying new sanctions on Moscow, wary of pushing Putin further away from the negotiating table. He also hasn’t approved new military aid for Ukraine, hopeful a swift end to the war means it won’t be required.', 'A timeline he offered last week for determining Putin’s seriousness in wanting an end to the war — “two weeks” — hasn’t been repeated since, and there seems to be little expectation he’ll take action when the self-imposed deadline arrives on Monday.', 'His laissez-faire position will be tested over the coming weeks, as Trump embarks on a series of global summits where he’ll come under pressure from US allies to adopt a firmer position.', 'He’s likely to encounter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in person at the Group of 7 summit in Canada, scheduled for mid-June. For the past three years, the conference has acted as something of a steering committee for western support to Ukraine, with Zelensky attending as a guest to underscore his requests for aid.', 'This year’s conference promises to be very different. Trump’s aides say there is little expectation he’ll agree to new sanctions on Russia while in Alberta.', 'A NATO summit a few weeks later will similarly put American support for Ukraine under a spotlight. NATO’s leaders have designed the summit to be brief and heavily focused on increasing member state defense spending, hoping to avoid any open hostility from a US president who has questioned the alliance’s importance.', 'Still, for all the preparations hosts of both summits have made to appease Trump, his current position on Ukraine could pose existential questions for leaders eager to encourage Trump’s attempts at negotiating a ceasefire.', 'The stance Trump espoused Thursday may not be his final one. A few moments after his “fight for a while” comparison, he insisted he was “for stopping killing.”', 'Yet his comments nonetheless reflected a new degree of resignation for his prospects of ending the war, and detachment from the conflict he once vowed to resolve.', '“They fight, fight, fight,” he said. “Sometimes you let them fight for a little while.”', 'The dispassionate tone was similar to how he described his call with Putin on Wednesday, when he related — without comment — the Russian leader’s determination that he would have to retaliate to Ukraine’s audacious drone attack over the weekend.', 'Trump did not say whether he cautioned Putin or encouraged him to calibrate his response. Nor did he offer any particular view of Ukraine’s actions.', 'His visitor in the Oval Office on Thursday sought to encourage a more confident outlook. Merz cited the anniversary this week of the D-Day invasion of Normandy — a turning point in World War II — as an example of “when the Americans once ended a war in Europe.”', 'Trump was not, at first, moved by the comparison.', '“That was not a pleasant day for you,” he joked, referring to the defeat of the German Nazis.', 'Merz kept going, however, stressing the American intervention amounted to “the liberation of my country from Nazi dictatorship” that has parallels to today’s war.', '“We know what we owe you,” he said. “But this is the reason why I’m saying that America is, again, in a very strong position to do something on this war and ending this war.”', 'Trump did not seem particularly moved. He stopped short of promising new sanctions on Russia — something European leaders have been pressing him on for weeks — saying only he would know when the time is right, but that it hadn’t arrived yet.', '“It’s in my brain, the deadline,” he said.', 'He even suggested he’d be willing to apply new punitive measures on Ukraine if the war doesn’t end.', '“We’ll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest,” Trump said. “You know, it takes two to tango.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

In Trump’s first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence, and Trump is now demanding at least 5 percent from allies.', 'The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a “good opportunity” for Germany to commit to meeting that 5 percent mark.', 'During their meeting on Thursday, Trump described Merz as a good representative of Germany and also “difficult,” which he suggested was a compliment.

It was soon followed by Ukraine’s surprise drone attack that proved disastrous for Russia, and that jolted global perceptions. This in turn led Russia to launch one of the largest barrages of missiles and drones of the war at targets across Ukraine.', 'This does not look like “the 10th yard line of peace.”', 'It was against this backdrop that Trump has apparently come up with a new metaphor.

Indeed, Russia invaded Ukraine back in February 2022 — more than three years ago — which Trump described at the time as “genius” and part of a “wonderful” strategy.', 'But let’s also not lose sight of the evolution of the American president’s thinking. Trump’s Plan A for the war in Ukraine was ending the conflict within 24 hours by way of a secret strategy he assured voters was real. When it became obvious that this strategy didn’t actually exist, Trump moved on to Plan B: He told Russia that if it failed to end the conflict quickly, the White House “would have no other choice” but to impose new economic sanctions.', 'When Putin ignored those threats and Trump failed to follow through, the American president floated Plan C (international economic penalties designed to force a ceasefire), Plan D (Trump-backed bilateral talks between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy) and Plan E (bilateral talks between Trump and Putin).', 'Plan F — White House passivity — is now increasingly coming into focus.
