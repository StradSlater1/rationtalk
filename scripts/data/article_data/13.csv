The not-so-secret motive underlying Trump’s travel ban,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/the-not-so-secret-motive-underlying-trumps-travel-ban/,"['The new travel ban against mostly Muslim or African countries was not nearly the Trump administration’s first attack against immigrants, but Seattle’s Wazhma Samizay said, “This time, it’s hitting me a lot harder.”', 'Samizay, who is Afghan American and was born in the U.S. but lived in Afghanistan as a child, said unlike the regulations that go into effect Monday, the travel ban in the first Trump administration happened when there was “more balance of power and more pushback.”', 'Now, she said, the threats are on a whole new level.', 'Her parents fled Afghanistan due to the Soviet Union’s invasion in the early 1980s to seek safety and to build a life, as so many others have done before them. But even though she’s a citizen, she said, people like her — “because we’re brown, because we’re Muslim” — will never be considered “American enough.”', 'Samizay is one of the many people in the Seattle area whose family is reeling from the implications of having their countries of origin named in the latest travel ban, a list of 19 banned or partially banned countries so random they betray the absurdity — and racism — underpinning the whole endeavor.', 'In announcing the ban, Trump used the horrific firebomb attack by an Egyptian man in Boulder against people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages as justification, but Egypt is not on the list.', 'The administration tried to argue the list was based on countries with poor vetting and visa overstays, but as The New York Times pointed out, Spain in 2023 had far more overstays than all seven banned African countries combined. Spain, of course, is not on the list.', 'Just as he tipped his hand in a meeting during his first administration by calling Haiti and other African nations “shithole countries,” Trump said last week in announcing the ban that “we don’t want them” — with “we” and “them” doing a lot of heavy lifting.  ', 'Roxana Norouzi, the executive director of Seattle-based immigrant rights organization OneAmerica, said the latest travel ban is “an expansion of Trump’s racist and xenophobic agenda to other immigrants, to place blame on Black and brown people and to advance his cruel agenda of family separation.”', 'She said the targeting of these countries has deep effects on people in Washington. ', 'For example, Norouzi said her parents came to the U.S. on visas from Iran. If she had been born today, she said, her grandmother would not have been able to visit after she was born because Iran is also on the travel ban list. ', '“This is about invoking harm and pain and separation on people in our communities, on our neighbors,” she said. “And it is about blocking and demonizing the citizens of certain countries.”', 'Many of those countries are already enduring unfathomable hardship and suffering. Sudan, another country on the list, is in the midst of a civil war and facing what the United Nations called “the most devastating humanitarian and displacement crisis in the world.” But instead of looking for ways to provide support and aid, the U.S. has slammed the door shut.', 'Mubarak Elamin, a Sudanese American community member from Bellevue, wrote on Facebook last week that he was deeply shaken by the new travel ban and its targeting of Muslim and African countries.', '“It tells us that our pain, our lives, and our futures are less valuable. This action revives a policy that has historically singled out Muslims and Africans under the false guise of national security. It is discriminatory, xenophobic and deeply unjust. The effects will ripple through Seattle’s Muslims, Sudanese and East African communities, many of whom are already reeling from separation, trauma and isolation.”', 'Unlike the protests that erupted at airports after the Muslim ban was announced during the first Trump administration, the public reaction to Travel Ban 2.0 has been more muted. Sometimes I fear that part of the administration’s strategy is to normalize cruelty so effectively that it’s no longer remarkable.', 'But we can’t let ourselves become desensitized to what our government is doing in our name.', 'Norouzi said while it might be easy to feel complacent and hopeless right now, we can’t succumb to that feeling. She said people can publicly show their rejection of the administration’s approach, but they can also start talking to their neighbors and friends about the commonalities that connect so many disparate communities. ', 'Samizay has a lot of worries now. The administration’s targeting of birthright citizenship has her feeling more fearful. How will we protect each other? Will we even try?', 'Though efforts, including the travel ban, are designed to pit groups against each other, she said some common truths connect us all. ', '“Everybody wants peace. Everybody wants their children to grow up happy and thrive and have an education and have an opportunity,” Samizay said. “That’s what everybody wants. I don’t care where you are in the world or what language that people speak. That is a universal thing.”']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVdVRXBZTmpZNWIyMVhjekJIVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQjBJakRTdVNLY1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

The president also personally turned the Oval Office into a screening room for bigoted conspiracy theories when he invited the president of South Africa to the White House and then bombarded him with false allegations of “white genocide” being committed in his country.', 'Needless to say, this hasn’t helped the U.S. build on its rapport with African nations.', 'Needless to say, this hasn’t helped the U.S. build on its rapport with African nations. And fundamentally, what that could mean for the U.S. is that a continent full of countries that American officials have pinpointed as crucial partners in our geopolitical strategies related to security and commerce could drift further toward our adversaries.', 'That’s certainly the vibe given off by the African Union Commission and its dozens of member states, which denounced Trump’s travel ban and warned about its potential impacts.', '“The Commission remains concerned about the potential negative impact of such measures on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades. Africa and the United States share mutual interests in promoting peace, prosperity, and global cooperation,” the commission said in a statement, adding: “The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the U.S. Administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned.”', 'University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers identified one clear way that Trump’s travel ban could harm the American economy.', '“One obvious economic implication of the latest travel ban is that genuinely international conferences will no longer be held in the U.S.,” he wrote on X.', 'And that may just be the tip of the iceberg.', 'It’s also true that the materials used to make batteries in everything from cutting-edge cars to phones and computers most often come from African mines. Which is to say: Trump’s cold shoulder toward African nations could have dire consequences for America’s future, particularly with regard to the economy and U.S. national security.', 'Ja’han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

But it arrived with no immediate signs of the chaos that unfolded at airports across the U.S. during Trump’s first travel ban in 2017.', 'Vincenta Aguilar said she was anxious Monday as she and her husband, both Guatemalan citizens, were subjected to three different interviews by U.S. officials after arriving at Miami International Airport and showing tourist visas the couple received last week.', '“They asked us where we work, how many children we have, if we have had any problems with the law, how we are going to afford the cost of this travel, how many days we will stay here,” said Aguilar, who along with her husband was visiting their son for the first time since he left Guatemala 22 years ago.', 'She said they were released about an hour after their flight landed, greeting their waiting family members in Florida with tears of relief. Guatemala is not among the countries included in the new ban or flagged for extra travel restrictions.', 'The new proclamation that Trump signed last week applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Trump’s new travel ban: the countries chosen and how it differs from the last one,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/what-is-trump-travel-ban-countries,"['President’s sweeping proclamation targets citizens of many countries and would dramatically reshape US border policy', 'Nearly five months into his second term, Donald Trump announced a new sweeping travel ban that could reshape the US’s borders more dramatically than any policy in modern memory. The order, banning citizens of 12 countries, came into effect at 12am ET in a move Trump said would protect the country from “foreign terrorists”.', 'The proclamation represents one of the most ambitious attempts to reshape the US’s approach to global mobility in modern history and potentially affects millions of people coming to the US for relocation, travel, work or school.', 'A travel ban restricts or prohibits citizens of specific countries from entering the US. These restrictions can range from complete visa suspensions to specific limitations on certain visa categories.', 'Trump’s day one executive order required the state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.', 'His travel ban proclamation, signed 4 June, referenced the previous executive order, as well as the recent attack by an Egyptian national in Boulder, Colorado, upon a group of people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.', 'A presidential proclamation is a decree that is often ceremonial or can have legal implications when it comes to national emergencies.', 'Unlike an executive order, which is a directive to heads of agencies in the administration, the proclamation primarily signals a broad change in policy.', 'The following countries were identified for total bans of any nationals seeking to travel to the US for immigration or non-immigration reasons:', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'Republic of the Congo', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Trump is also partly restricting the travel of people from:', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'The proclamation broadly cites national security issues for including the countries, but specifies a few different issues that reach the level of concern for the travel ban.', 'For some countries, such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Venezuela, the proclamation claims that there is no reliable central authority for issuing passports or screening and vetting nationals traveling out of the country.', 'For other countries, such as Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan, the proclamation cites a high rate of immigrants overstaying their business, tourist and student visas in the US.', 'Finally, there are several countries that are included because of terrorist activity or state-sponsored terrorism, including Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and Cuba.', 'In the draft travel ban plans that were leaked in March, the original list contained 43 nations across three tiers of restrictions. Now the ban has been filtered down to 19 countries.', 'Among the puzzling inclusions is Venezuela, which the White House says lacks competent document-issuing authorities. Trump has recently pursued a thaw in relations with the country that has proven useful to his deportation initiatives – though the country’s inclusion is likely tied to Venezuelans already in the US who have been a clear target for the White House.', 'The 2017 ban initially targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries before expanding to include North Korea and Venezuela. This new proclamation is broader and also makes the notable addition of Haiti.', 'During his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump amplified false claims made by his running mate, JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the pets of the people that live there”. The proclamation falsely claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration” and this “influx harms American communities”. In fact, about 200,000 Haitians were granted temporary protected status, which gives legal residency permits to foreign nationals who are unable to return home safely due to conditions in their home countries.', 'Also notable are the restrictions on Afghans, given that many of the Afghans approved to live in the US as refugees were forced to flee their home country as a result of working to support US troops there, before the full withdrawal of US forces in 2021. The agreement with the Taliban to withdraw US troops was negotiated by Trump during his first term.', 'Last month, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced “the termination of temporary protected status for Afghanistan”, effective 20 May.', 'The restrictions will be reviewed every 180 days for potential modification.', 'Current visa holders remain largely protected: the restrictions only apply to people outside the US without valid visas as of 9 June. No existing visas will be revoked, the White House said.', 'But new visa applications from people from these countries will be suspended or severely limited, with some exceptions for diplomatic visas, immediate family members and cases involving US national interest – one such example being the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.', 'For employers, the ban threatens significant workforce disruptions across the tech, healthcare and education sectors, with companies unable to hire from the 12 countries targeted by a full ban. For the seven countries on a partial ban, employers can still hire on some work visas but cannot sponsor green cards, and visas will have reduced durations.', 'The impact could be particularly severe for international Stem talent, medical professionals and academic recruitment.', 'The education and health industries alone employ about 5.5 million foreign-born workers.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVdVRXBZTmpZNWIyMVhjekJIVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQjBJakRTdVNLY1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

Donald Trump's travel ban is more 'sad news' for immigrants in Michigan,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/06/06/donald-trump-travel-ban-michigan-immigrants/84053215007/,"[""President Donald Trump's travel ban that restricts people from 19 nations is being criticized by immigrant advocates and two congresswomen from Michigan. The ban, which goes into effect Monday, June 9, is aimed at several countries, most of them in the Arab world and Africa."", '""It\'s very unfortunate, sad news,"" Abdulhakem Alsadah, president of the Dearborn-based National Association of Yemeni Americans, Behavioral Health & Community Social Services, told the Free Press on Thursday, June 5, the day after Trump signed the executive order banning entry.', 'Alsadah said he wasn\'t surprised, that he ""knew it was coming"" based on Trump\'s earlier statements he would issue another travel ban like he did during his first term. But ""it\'s still a headache"" for many in Michigan, he said.', ""Trump's ban, announced late Wednesday, June 4, prohibits people from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially restricts and limits the entry of people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela."", 'Yemeni Americans — who are the largest Middle Eastern group in Detroit, Melvindale, Coldwater and Hamtramck, census data shows — already face challenges because of the war in Yemen that led to the shutdown of all U.S. embassies and consulates. Trump\'s travel ban ""will only add to this misery,"" Alsadah said.', ""Metro Detroit, which has the highest percentage of Arab Americans among regions in the United States, became an epicenter for challenges to Trump's first travel ban, often referred to as the Muslim travel ban since most of the nations were Muslim-majority nations. Nabih Ayad, a Detroit attorney, filed a federal lawsuit in Detroit in January 2017, shortly after Trump's first ban, on behalf of Muslims unable to travel to the United States to be with family members. There were several rallies held by Muslims and progressive groups in Michigan, including one at Detroit Metro Airport in Romulus. A federal court ruled in their favor the following month and they got a federal injunction blocking the ban, which was later rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in January 2021 shortly after he took office."", '""I think its sends the wrong message, that America is not open to democracy and freedom,"" Ayad, the founder and board chairman of the Dearborn-based Arab American Civil Rights League, said of Trump\'s latest travel ban. It also violates the constitution and will impact families in metro Detroit, he said.', 'In making his announcement of the travel ban, Trump started his remarks by talking about the firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1 that injured 15 people taking part in a rally for Israeli hostages. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an immigrant from Egypt who overstayed his visa; he was charged June 5 with 118 criminal counts.', '""The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,"" Trump said from the White House. ""We don\'t want them. In the 21st century, we\'ve seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places all over the world.. ... In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil. We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America.""', ""But critics said Trump's reasoning has more to do with which countries the United States favors in its foreign policy rather than protecting Americans. Ayad noted that the man who carried out the June 1 attack in Boulder was from Egypt, which is not included in the travel ban."", '""It has nothing to do with national security,"" Ayad said.', 'U.S. Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Detroit, said the travel ban is rooted in racism.', '“It should come as no surprise that Trump’s racist travel ban overwhelmingly targets Black and brown people from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean,"" Tlaib said in a statement. ""These policies are rooted in white nationalism and will only increase hate, xenophobia, and Islamophobia in our country.""', 'Tlaib described Trump as “the white-supremacist-in-chief"" who ""has once again issued an unconstitutional travel ban"" around the time that Muslims are celebrating a major holiday on Friday, June 6.', '""This comes as Muslims in our communities and around the world prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha,"" the Detroit congresswoman said. ""It is a shameful expansion of his hateful Muslim and African ban from his first term.""', 'U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, who used to live in Dearborn, also released a statement, saying ""Trump’s renewed travel ban will not make us safer, it will create more division. It\'s based on bigotry and xenophobia, just like the last one. U.S. policy should not be guided by hatred. This travel ban should not stand, and we must fight against it.""', 'Under Trump\'s latest travel ban, there are exceptions to the restrictions. People who are still allowed from the 19 nations include: permanent residents of the United States known as green card holders, some immediate family members of U.S. citizens, ""ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran,"" Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war with the Taliban, and athletes participating in the ""World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State,"" the order reads.', 'The latest order is more detailed in its rules, which is helpful, but the problem in many cases is implementation, advocates said. Individual officials may not understand the details of the ban and apply a broad brush.', 'Some officials ""are not well trained, especially overseas at embassies in specific countries,"" Alsadah said. ""So it\'s going to be hard for everybody.""', 'Christine Sauvé, the head of community engagement and communication for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, agreed with Tlaib that the ban is discriminatory.', '""The ban again targets Black, brown, and Muslim people who have recently fled places experiencing insecurity and strife,"" she said. ""Many Michiganders have ties to the affected countries and it will sadly affect thousands of innocent people who are trying to reunite with loved ones, travel for college studies, or visit family for the holidays.""', 'Sauvé said the ban is the latest move by the Trump administration that cracks down on immigrants in Michigan and other states that is hurting communities and affecting local economies.', 'USA TODAY contributed to this report.', 'Contact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com, X @nwarikoo or Facebook @nwarikoo']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVdVRXBZTmpZNWIyMVhjekJIVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQjBJakRTdVNLY1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

The administration is also imposing partial restrictions, which will prevent people from coming to the U.S. to immigrate or study but will allow tourist travel, on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.', 'The administration says it implemented the ban in order to prevent future terror attacks in the aftermath of Sunday’s anti-Semitic terrorist attack on a rally in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza. “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” Trump said in a video announcing the new ban.', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVdVRXBZTmpZNWIyMVhjekJIVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQjBJakRTdVNLY1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

Rochester Somali Community Center reacts to White House’s new travel ban,https://www.kttc.com/2025/06/09/rochester-somali-community-center-reacts-white-houses-new-travel-ban/,"['ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – Monday marked the first day of the White House’s ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 countries. This proclamation, signed by President Donald Trump last week, affects citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.', 'In the United States, Minnesota is home to the highest population of Somali residents with more than 80,000 Somali residents living in the state. The White House included Somalia in the travel ban, stating the following reasons:', '“Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects. A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia’s territory. The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven. Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations. Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States. The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement.  Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. The entry into the United States of nationals of Somalia as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.”', 'Rochester Somali Community Center, a nonprofit that opened its doors in November 2023, works to break barriers for Somalis in America who are committing a fresh start in the country. According to the organization, the travel ban impacts Somali Americans and their families.', '“As a proud U.S. citizen of Somali origin, I believe it is time for a constructive and compassionate dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the travel ban that has affected many Somali families,” RSCC Executive Director Said Hussain wrote. “I strongly feel that the ban may not have originated from his personal views, but rather from the advice of others—and that his stance could change with the right information and engagement.“', 'Hussain stated many Somalis have close family members in the Somalia and in refugee camps who have already gone through extensive vetting and are awaiting reunification with loved ones who are U.S. citizens.', '“This situation is heartbreaking for families who are simply seeking to be together in peace and safety,” he said. ”The United States and Somalia have a long-standing relationship. The Somali people hold deep respect and gratitude for the support the U.S. provided during and after the civil war. While many wealthy, neighboring countries in the Muslim world did not offer help, the United States extended its hand—and we will never forget that.“', 'Hussain added Somalis have no animosity toward the U.S. He wrote, “On the contrary, we admire and appreciate this nation and all it represents. We simply hope that the spirit of compassion, fairness, and family unity will prevail, and that the U.S. will continue to be a beacon of hope for those in need. Thank you, America. We are grateful for all you’ve done, and we remain hopeful for a future where our families can be reunited once again.”', 'The new ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the U.S. even after the ban takes effect.', 'Find stories like this and more, in our apps.', '', 'Copyright 2025 KTTC.

RESTRICTING THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN NATIONALS TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES FROM FOREIGN TERRORISTS AND OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/restricting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety-threats/,"['BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n \nA PROCLAMATION', 'During my first Administration, I restricted the entry of foreign nationals into the United States, which successfully prevented national security threats from reaching our borders and which the Supreme Court upheld.  In Executive Order 14161 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), I stated that it is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes. ', 'I also stated that the United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or our national interests.  More importantly, the United States must identify such aliens before their admission or entry into the United States.  The United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the United States do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists or other threats to our national security.', 'I directed the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to identify countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  After completing that process, the Secretary of State determined that a number of countries remain deficient with regards to screening and vetting.  Many of these countries have also taken advantage of the United States in their exploitation of our visa system and their historic failure to accept back their removable nationals. ', 'As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.  I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks.  Nationals of some countries also pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States, which increases burdens on immigration and law enforcement components of the United States, and often exacerbates other risks related to national security and public safety.', 'Some of the countries with inadequacies face significant challenges to reform efforts.  Others have made important improvements to their protocols and procedures, and I commend them for these efforts.  But until countries with identified inadequacies address them, members of my Cabinet have recommended certain conditional restrictions and limitations.  I have considered and largely accepted those recommendations and impose the limitations set forth below on the entry into the United States by the classes of foreign nationals identified in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation.', 'NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.  I therefore hereby proclaim the following:', 'Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks and other national security or public-safety threats.  Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with visa adjudications and other immigration processes play a critical role in implementing that policy.  These protocols enhance our ability to detect foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism, or otherwise pose a safety threat, and they aid our efforts to prevent such individuals from entering the United States.', '(b)  Information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices of foreign governments are important for the effectiveness of the screening and vetting protocols and procedures of the United States.  Governments manage the identity and travel documents of their nationals and residents. They also control the circumstances under which they provide information about their nationals to other governments, including information about known or suspected terrorists and criminal-history information.  It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to take all necessary and appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices and to regularly share their identity and threat information with the immigration screening and vetting systems of the United States.', '(c)  Section 2(b) of Executive Order 14161 directed the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, within 60 days of the date of that order, to jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, a report identifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the entry or admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).', '(d)  On April 9, 2025, the Secretary of State, with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, presented the report described in subsection (c) of this section, recommending that entry restrictions and limitations be placed on foreign nationals of several countries.  The report identified countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full suspension of admissions and countries that warrant a partial suspension of admission.', '(e)  In evaluating the recommendations from the Secretary of State and in determining what restrictions to impose for each country, I consulted with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, appropriate Assistants to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  I considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals.  And I further considered various factors, including each country’s screening and vetting capabilities, information sharing policies, and country-specific risk factors — including whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals. ', 'I also considered the different risks posed by aliens admitted on immigrant visas and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas.  Persons admitted on immigrant visas become lawful permanent residents of the United States.  Such persons may present national security or public-safety concerns that may be distinct from those admitted as nonimmigrants.  The United States affords lawful permanent residents more enduring rights than it does to nonimmigrants.  Lawful permanent residents are more difficult to remove than nonimmigrants, even after national security concerns arise, which increases the costs and aggravates the dangers of errors associated with admitting such individuals.  And although immigrants are generally subject to more extensive vetting than nonimmigrants, such vetting is far less reliable when the country from which someone seeks to emigrate maintains inadequate identity-management or information-sharing policies or otherwise poses risks to the national security of the United States.', 'I reviewed these factors and assessed these goals, with a particular focus on crafting country-specific restrictions.  This approach was designed to encourage cooperation with the subject countries in recognition of each country’s unique circumstances.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are, in my judgment, necessary to prevent the entry or admission of foreign nationals about whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose to the United States.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are necessary to garner cooperation from foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives.', '(f)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries:  Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.', '(g)  I have determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries:  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants. ', '(h)  Sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation describe some of the identity-management or information-sharing inadequacies that led me to impose restrictions.  These inadequacies are sufficient to justify my finding that unrestricted entry of nationals from the named countries would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and many such details are classified.', 'Sec. 2.  Full Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.  The entry into the United States of nationals of the following countries is hereby suspended and limited, as follows, subject to the categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers described in section 5 of this proclamation:', '(a)  Afghanistan', '(i)   The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan.  Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Fiscal Year 2023 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”), Afghanistan had a business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visa overstay rate of 9.70 percent and a student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay rate of 29.30 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Afghanistan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(b)  Burma', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Burma had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent.  Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Burma as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(c)  Chad', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent.  According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent.  The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.  ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Chad as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(d)  Republic of the Congo', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.14 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of the Republic of the Congo as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(e)  Equatorial Guinea', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 70.18 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Equatorial Guinea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(f)  Eritrea', '(i)   The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea.  Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals.  Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.43 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Eritrea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(g)  Haiti', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Haiti had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05 percent.  Additionally, hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.  This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.  As is widely known, Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Haiti as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(h)  Iran', '(i)   Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.  Iran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Iran as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended.', '(i)  Libya', '(i)   There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya.  The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Libya as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(j)  Somalia', '(i)   Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects.

Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.  The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement.  Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Somalia as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(k)  Sudan', '(i)   Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Overstay Report, Sudan had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 26.30 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 28.40 percent. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Sudan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(l)  Yemen', '(i)   Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  The government does not have physical control over its own territory.  Since January 20, 2025, Yemen has been the site of active United States military operations.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Yemen as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', 'Sec. 3.  Partial Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.', '(a)  Burundi', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Burundi had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Burundi as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Burundi to the extent permitted by law.', '(b)  Cuba', '(i)    Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.  The Government of Cuba does not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with the United States.  Cuba has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 18.75 percent.', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Cuba as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Cuba to the extent permitted by law.', '(c)  Laos', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent.  Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who has also lived in Kuwait. Neither of these countries is on Trump’s list of banned countries.', 'In a Truth Social post, Trump blamed “[former US President Joe] Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said the suspect in the Boulder incident had overstayed a tourist visa, without naming Soliman.', 'A fact sheet published by the White House stated a specific justification for the exclusion of each country on the new travel ban list.', 'These justifications included that large numbers of citizens had overstayed their visas, that the countries had a poor record of cooperating with the US to receive their citizens back if they had overstayed in the US, or that the countries were affected by war.', 'According to the most recent figures from the US Department of Homeland Security, nationals of Chad had the highest overstay rate, at 49.5 percent of those arriving in the US on a visa. Others with high overstay rates were Equatorial Guinea (22 percent), Eritrea (20 percent) and Yemen (19.8 percent).', 'On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order, calling on his state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”. He referred to this order in his video announcement of the travel ban.', 'The travel ban will take effect on June 9 at 12:01am EDT (04:01 GMT).', 'Yes, Trump enacted a travel ban – dubbed the “Muslim ban” as all but one of the countries on the list at that time were Muslim-majority – during his first term in 2017.', 'In his Wednesday Truth Social video, Trump said: “In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil.”', 'However, Mittelstadt from the Migration Policy Institute said: “We are unfamiliar with any prior evidence or public statements by the US government that the first-term travel bans prevented any terrorist attacks on US soil.', 'She explained that while much of intelligence and counter terrorism work is never made public, the first-term travel bans were criticised by some former, high-level intelligence and diplomatic officials who had served in both Republican and Democratic administrations.', 'In 2017, they issued a joint declaration, filed in the legal challenge to the original travel bans. In this declaration, they said that “banning travel from the original countries did not enhance national security and might even undermine counterterrorism efforts”, Mittelstadt said.', 'That earlier ban went through several revisions. It was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018. In 2021, Biden repealed this ban, calling it “a stain on our national conscience”.', 'Yes. In his Truth Social video announcement, Trump said “the list is subject to revision based on whether material improvements are made.', '“Likewise, new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world.”', 'The African Union, which includes seven of the 12 nations on the full travel ban list, said the ban would harm “people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and broader diplomatic relations” that were built with the US over past decades.', '“The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the US administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned,” the bloc said in a statement.', 'Chad responded by suspending visas for US citizens. In a Facebook post on Thursday, President Idriss Deby said: “I have instructed the government to act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity and suspend the issuance of visas to US citizens.”', '“The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws,” Trump’s proclamation stated.', 'Other African nations were more conciliatory, however. Dahir Hassan Abdi, the Somali ambassador to the US, said in a statement that Somalia is ready to work with the US. “Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised,” he said.', 'Trump’s proclamation described Somalia as “a terrorist safe haven” and stated: “Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.”', 'Similarly, Sierra Leone’s information minister, Chernor Bah, said: “Our attitude to this is what more can we do?

Trump’s travel ban could cement racism as his most dangerous legacy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/trump-travel-ban-policy-racism,"['From his so-called ‘Muslim ban’ to slashing DEI measures, the US president has turned taboo behaviour into norms', 'This month marks exactly 10 years since Donald Trump coasted down an escalator at Trump Tower, declared his run for US president and accused Mexico of sending drugs, criminals and rapists into the homeland. The past decade has been exercise in normalising.', 'When Trump threatened to terminate Elon Musk’s government contracts, and Musk linked Trump to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, all because of a petty clash of egos, people were riveted but unsurprised. Likewise, when Trump ordered a travel ban on a dozen countries, many reacted with a collective shrug: well, of course he did.', 'There was little sign of the collective uprising and airport protests that greeted Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” – an executive order that barred travel to the US for 90 days from seven predominantly Muslim countries – in January 2017. The president’s spectacular blow-up with Musk ensured the attention cycle quickly moved on.', 'Yet travel ban 2.0 is no less pernicious. The proclamation signed by Trump last Wednesday bans the citizens from many of the world’s poorest nations, supposedly to protect the US against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.', 'The countries affected are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The entry of people from seven other countries – Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela – will be partially restricted.', '“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,” Trump said.', 'He cited the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a man tossed a gasoline bomb into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators as an example of why the new curbs are needed.', 'An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Yet Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits, nor is Syria, whose Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by Trump as a “young, attractive guy” after their recent meeting.', 'Alex Berrios, a co-founder of Mi Vecino, a community empowerment organisation, and the son of a Cuban immigrant, said: “Trump targeted countries with Black, Brown and Muslim populations. There is no clear national security basis for the ban, but there is a clear pattern of targeting people of color. Latino and immigrant communities recognize this as a racist policy, plain and simple.”', 'Indeed, the list points to a 78-year-old president who continues to view large swaths of the world as drug-dealers, criminals and rapists, who finds new and ingenious ways to play white identity politics, whose “Make America great again” mantra is coded nostalgia for an era of American apartheid.', 'In 1973, Trump and his father, Fred, were sued for discriminating against Black applicants by refusing to rent apartments to them in predominantly white buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. The case was settled with no admission of guilt but a requirement that the Trumps change their practices.', 'In 1989, after five Black and Latino teenagers were accused of assaulting and raping a white jogger in New York’s Central Park, Trump took out full-page ads in several newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. The Central Park Five were convicted and later exonerated but even last year Trump continued to assert they were responsible for the crime.', 'From 2011 to 2016, Trump was a leading proponent of the debunked “birther” theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore was ineligible to be president. After Obama released his birth certificate, Trump admitted the truth but never apologised and continued to refer to Barack “Hussein” Obama.', 'After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counter-protester was killed, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides” and blamed “many sides” for the violence. He later tweeted: “I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!”', 'In a 2018 White House meeting on immigration, Trump reportedly asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”, referring to Haiti and African nations, and suggested more immigrants from places such as Norway.', 'During 2020 protests over George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, Trump sent national guard troops to Washington and deployed federal officers to Portland, Oregon, leading to injuries. He also called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”, linked by critics to a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes.', 'At last year’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, he falsely claimed that Kamala Harris “turned Black” for political gain, questioning the vice-president’s heritage. And on the campaign trail, Trump said immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.', 'Since returning to the White House, Trump has issued executive orders that aim to restrict or eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He even baselessly blamed DEI for undermining air safety after an army helicopter pilot was involved in a deadly midair collision with a commercial airliner.', 'With the help of Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Trump has slashed foreign aid and gutted the development agency USAID, causing death and devastation for people in Africa and elsewhere.', 'Meanwhile, the immigration crackdown has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students and deport others.', 'The US granted refugee status to around 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”. Trump ambushed South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, who is Black, with a video that falsely portrayed “burial sites” and articles that included an image of body bags from the Congolese city of Goma.', 'He has also repeatedly singled out “Congo” in Africa for emptying its prisons and sending criminals to the US. During a meeting last month with Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, he said: “Many, many people come from the Congo. I don’t know what that is, but they came from the Congo.”', 'Factcheckers have found no evidence to support this claim. Trump’s travel ban includes the Republic of Congo but not the much bigger Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is currently negotiating a minerals deal with Washington. The Republic of Congo said the country’s inclusion was a “misunderstanding”.', 'Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, says: “This is just another page from the catalogue of racism, bigotry, hate and white supremacy that Trump flips to and uses as his guide so often.', '“He needs to keep putting coins in the rightwing machine because that is what keeps them going. In many ways he has to do this in order to stay true to who he is and his candidacy and Trumpism, because one of the key ingredients of Trumpism is racism, and we’ve seen that confirmed over and over again.”', 'After a decade of Trump dominance, none of it comes as a surprise any more. What was once outrageous and taboo is now routine.

Trump travel ban hits immigrant family coming to U.S. amid bloody civil war in Myanmar,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/trump-travel-ban-myanmar-civil-war-visa-rcna211500,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She’d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother’s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.', 'The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn’t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country’s active civil war.', 'With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.', '“It’s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,” said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a “rug got pulled out from under us in an instant.”', 'White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump’s policy is in the “best interest of the American people and their safety.”', '“His commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,” Jackson said. “The restrictions fulfill the President’s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.”', 'The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.', 'According to Trump’s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed “unacceptable.” A few countries lacked “the competence of the central authority” for issuing passports, the proclamation said.', 'Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.', '“Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,” the proclamation said.', 'However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.', 'Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.', 'The new travel ban comes as Myanmar’s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.', '“Junta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,” Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. “More than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.”', 'Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there’s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump’s immigration policies.', ""“It’s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn’t do their job or didn’t believe that their visa was true,” the woman's husband said. “It’s quite frankly terrifying.”"", 'For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.', '“Their circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,” the woman said. “My brother was concerned for his children’s future and education.”', ""Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn’t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother’s kids had aged out of the system."", 'According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.', 'At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar’s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.', '“The reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,” the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. “Now, it’s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.”', 'Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of “the engine of Trump’s mass deportation machine.”', '“It’s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole — especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,” Dinh said.', 'Rather than protecting individuals’ safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump’s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.', '“It perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who’ve been separated,” Dinh said.', 'She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.', ""“We’ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,” the woman's husband said. “Now, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries … without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They’ve done nothing wrong.”"", 'Kimmy Yam is a reporter for NBC Asian America.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVdVRXBZTmpZNWIyMVhjekJIVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrQjBJakRTdVNLY1FF=-w280-h168-p-df

What are the reasons and who is exempt?', 'This time, it\'s not a new executive order but a presidential proclamation that has caused a worldwide stir. The policy signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday is entitled ""Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats"" and takes effect on June 9.', ""Like executive orders, presidential proclamations are one of the instruments with which a US president can implement the administration's will, particularly regarding national security and immigration."", ""Unlike laws, these documents do not require the approval of Congress. However, they must be based on powers granted by law. In terms of content, Trump's new proclamation ties in with previous travel bans imposed during his first term as president, which the Supreme Court upheld in 2018."", 'The proclamation bans entry to the US for all nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, regardless of their reasons for travel, unless the State Department deems their entry into the US to be in the national interest.', 'In addition to these 12 countries, people from seven additional nations will face partial restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Stricter visa checks and restrictions will apply, but these will also be case-dependent.

According to the US Department of Homeland Security, he had overstayed his tourist visa. Egypt is not listed in Trump's newest proclamation."", 'In the proclamation, the Republican president argues that the countries affected by the new travel ban do not provide enough information on their nationals to assess potential security risks. Some of the countries listed — Iran and Cuba, for example — have been designated by Washington as ""state sponsors of terrorism."" This new ban will tighten up already existing measures.', 'The Trump administration has criticized the fact that some countries do not take back their nationals when the US requires them to leave.', 'However, critics have speculated that the ban has political and economic reasons, pointing out that Saudi Arabia and other countries, with which the Trump family has close business ties, will not be affected.', 'If not exempt, nationals from the banned countries will no longer be able to enter the US from June 9 for business trips, educational travel or family visits. The decision is also likely to have economic repercussions. The poorer countries on the list in particular, such as Haiti and Yemen, have benefited from trade ties with the US, as well as remittances sent by people living and working in the US.', 'Human rights groups have slammed the travel ban as being racist and discriminatory, pointing out that refugees and asylum-seekers from conflict regions will now lose access to protection programs in the US.
