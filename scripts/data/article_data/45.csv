"‘Ballerina’ Director Len Wiseman on the Film’s Most Killer Set Pieces, from an Ice Skate Melee to a ‘Snowball Fight’ with Grenades",https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/ballerina-director-len-wiseman-interview-ana-de-armas-1235129005/,"['', 'Director Len Wiseman is no stranger to action franchises, having helmed the first two “Underworld” movies as well as the fourth entry in Bruce Willis‘ John McClane saga, “Live Free or Die Hard.” Stepping into the universe of “John Wick” to direct “Ballerina,” a film about a new character (neophyte assassin Eve Macarro, played by Ana de Armas), Wiseman knew he had a formidable tradition to live up to — and the best way of doing so was to take the action in an entirely new direction.', '“I didn’t want to replicate what ‘John Wick‘ did in terms of the fighting style,” Wiseman told IndieWire. “I wanted Ana to have her own energy and voice.” To that end, Wiseman kept a close eye on de Armas’ progress while she was training with the 87eleven stunt designers who have been a key part of the “John Wick” franchise since the beginning.', '', ""“During rehearsal, I would be planning with my production designer, and I’d get updates saying things like, ‘Ana is really good at kicks,'” Wiseman said. “So we would build that into her language.” During prep, Wiseman began conceptualizing set pieces designed to capitalize on de Armas’ strengths and to convey that this is an assassin at a very different stage in her career from John Wick."", '', '“She’s a new assassin, so it was much more survival action than attack action,” Wiseman said. “She’s jumping into a world where she’s up against a lot of very seasoned assassins.” Keeping this in mind, Wiseman and the 87eleven team went to work on action sequences in which Eve would improvise, using anything and everything around her to fight off the onslaught of trained killers.', 'That led to some extremely entertaining and original set pieces, like one where Eve fights off a series of attackers by wielding a pair of ice skates as weapons. Wiseman’s first draft of the sequence began in his garage, where he typically creates rough sketches of his action scenes using models and action figures that he shoots on his iPhone. “I have a very elaborate setup with different scales of cars and other things,” he said. “I work and search around for the scene and that gives me a pretty good idea going in of what the edit is going to be.”', 'For a sequence involving ice skates, Wiseman began with a pair he picked up from a sporting goods store. “I put blood all over them and shot a few moves in my garage where she would use them like gauntlets on her hands,” Wiseman said. He then shared his concept with the 87eleven team, who helped him build on top of the original moves to develop the set piece. “They took it to a place where she used the shoelaces and swung the skates like a mace.”', '', 'Because scenes like the ice-skate fight grew organically out of character, de Armas could act while fighting in a way that gives each action sequence in “Ballerina” added intensity and urgency. “Sometimes, the more complicated the action gets in terms of the choreography and how much there is to remember, the acting takes a back seat,” Wiseman said. “Ana just will not allow that to happen. There’s so much emotion and passion being performed during the action.”', 'One of the pleasures of “Ballerina” for audiences is the way that it tweaks action movie conventions. You may have seen flamethrowers in films before, but here there’s an out-and-out flamethrower gunfight between de Armas and a foe. Another sequence finds de Armas wiping out an entire team of assassins with grenades in an elaborately choregraphed series of exhilarating camera moves. “I thought, what about a snowball fight, but with grenades,” Wiseman said, adding that executing the idea was one of the movie’s biggest directorial challenges.', '“I wanted to shoot that sequence in longer takes so you never get a chance to breathe, so we had a lot of trap doors and hidden sections of the set.” The action was carefully planned so that bad guys would fall out of frame just before the explosives were detonated, because Wiseman wanted the pyrotechnics to be practical and not added during post. “The timing of it was really challenging, but I like that. I don’t necessarily want to make a movie where there are no challenges, no pressure.”', '', 'Throughout the film, Wiseman looked to Ted Kotcheff’s original “First Blood” for inspiration. “This was my opportunity to pay a little bit of homage to the movie 15-year-old me loved,” he said. “As the series went on it got a little more superhero-esque, but in ‘First Blood,’ you felt for Rambo because he was having to search and survive and turn everything he could into a weapon. And that’s what I was picturing with Eve, who has no arsenal. She just has to live by her wits.”', 'Another highlight in “Ballerina” comes when Eve has to fight John Wick, and Wiseman synthesizes the two fighting styles — “John Wick” and “First Blood” — in one scene. “Working with Keanu Reeves and having John Wick come into the ‘Ballerina’ world was a really memorable moment for me,” Wiseman said. “Often, you fantasize about a scene and it doesn’t really come off, but the scene between them in the snow was exactly what I imagined, and it was something I had been picturing in my head for a long time.”', '“Ballerina” marks Wiseman’s return to feature films after over 10 years working in the world of episodic television, though he stresses that while he might not look busy to the outside world, he’s never left movies behind him — he just got a little pickier, and some of the projects he chose didn’t come to fruition. “For four years I was working on what was supposed to be the last John McClane movie,” Wiseman said. “It was such a cool script and such a cool idea. Other movies would pop up, and I’d be like, ‘No, this is going. We’re close.’ There were four years where I thought that movie was happening and then it didn’t.”', '', 'The McClane project was shut down for good after Bruce Willis’ aphasia diagnosis, and Wiseman was thrilled to get back to big-screen action after a sojourn directing pilots for series as varied as “Hawaii Five-O,” “Lucifer,” and “Swamp Thing.” Those shows’ tighter schedules and budgets helped Wiseman hone his ability to think on his feet, but “Ballerina” reminded him of what he’d been missing.', '“I had great collaborators on TV, but it’s just, get as much action as you can and move on,” Wiseman said. “I missed the time and respect you get when you’re making an action movie. It’s a whole different mentality. If audiences are leaving their house for it, it has to be good. It has to be at a certain level. And you need to take the time.”', '“Ballerina” opens in theaters June 6.', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"The John Wickification of Movies Is Underway, but ‘Ballerina’ Is a Worthy Spinoff",https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/06/movies/john-wick-movies-ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-keanu-reeves,"['My life can be divided into two phases: Before Baba Yaga (BBY) and After Baba Yaga (ABY). When the first John Wick hit theaters in 2014, I was a senior in college, tagging along with my friend who was assigned to review the film for our student newspaper. When I say I knew nothing about John Wick, I mean nothing—never watched a trailer, read about the premise, or even saw a poster for it. Keanu Reeves was 15 years removed from The Matrix, and his career had mostly floundered since. There was little reason to believe a movie about some guy named John would move the needle—for Reeves, for the action genre, for anything, really. ', 'That I had zero expectations going into John Wick made everything that happened in the film hit that much harder. At first, you’re emotionally destroyed by the death of Wick’s adorable puppy at the hands of Russian gangsters, a risky way to set the tone for a movie without alienating viewers. But then you find out that these goons unknowingly pissed off the Steph Curry of headshots, and John Wick is off to the races. Wick exacting revenge in brutal, balletic fight sequences? Soul-nourishing. A criminal underworld with a byzantine set of rules, its own form of currency, and an international hotel chain that serves as neutral territory for assassins? Unimpeachable. Don Keefer from The Newsroom showing up as a cop who’s completely terrified that Wick has been coaxed out of retirement and doesn’t even consider arresting him for murder? Iconic. By the time Wick wiped out the Russian mafia and adopted a new dog, I was already scheduling an appointment to get my entire back tattooed in the Baba Yaga’s image. ', 'All told, John Wick delivered everything you’d want from an action movie (a capable lead who lets their fists do most of the talking; jaw-dropping fight scenes) and some things you didn’t even know you needed (knowingly over-the-top world-building; a villain so freaked out by the protagonist that he basically tells his failson to make funeral arrangements). Also worth celebrating: John Wick was a wholly original concept, the sort of mid-budget swing that’s become increasingly lost in the shuffle of Hollywood IP. The cultlike following for John Wick inevitably led to sequels, each one raising the bar when it comes to action, incorporating everything from horses and motorcycles to pencils and library books in Wick’s seemingly never-ending quest to kill hundreds of henchmen. (And who can blame him? I’d go to war for this dog.)', 'Of course, the real influence of John Wick can be appreciated through the slew of imitators that’ve emerged in its wake. It’s an easy template to follow: a solitary hero trying to move on from their violent past before some harrowing incident compels them to seek vengeance. On Netflix alone, there’s an entire cottage industry of movies meant to scratch the Wick itch, including Gunpowder Milkshake, Polar, Kate, and The Mother. Theatrical releases, meanwhile, have repurposed the John Wick premise as star vehicles for Bob Odenkirk, Dev Patel, Ke Huy Quan, and [checks notes] Santa Claus. Now, the Wickification of the action genre has come full circle: Friday marks the release of Ballerina, the first spinoff film in the franchise, taking place between the events of John Wick: Chapter 3—Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. ', 'Fresh off nearly stealing No Time to Die out from under Daniel Craig during the movie’s kick-ass detour to Cuba, Ana de Armas is Eve Macarro, a ballerina-cum-assassin trained by the Ruska Roma, the Belarusian syndicate that holds a seat at the franchise’s Illuminati-esque High Table. You’re gonna have a hard time believing this, but Eve is out for revenge. She’s hell-bent on avenging her father’s death and learning more about her mysterious past, no matter who stands in her way—even the Baba Yaga himself. ', '', '', 'While de Armas is an intriguing lead for a John Wick spinoff, the franchise has sputtered of late: The 2023 prequel series, The Continental, was a bizarre misfire that swapped out the beloved Reeves for, of all people, Mel Gibson. As for Ballerina, it underwent extensive, monthslong reshoots last year under John Wick director Chad Stahelski, indicating that the action originally helmed by Len Wiseman wasn’t up to snuff. Throw in Lionsgate’s implementation of a controversial embargo where members of the press could share “spoiler-free enthusiasm” in May but had to avoid “critical social sentiment and formal reviews” until Wednesday, and Ballerina had all the makings of a shit show. ', 'As it happens, Lionsgate caused a big fuss for no damn reason. Ballerina isn’t quite at the level of the mainline John Wick films, but it’s a worthy extension of the universe. The plot is threadbare, but you’re here for the action, and it delivers more of what we’ve come to expect. While a character does tell Eve during her assassin training that she shouldn’t be afraid to “fight like a girl,” in this case, it means employing the franchise’s standard gun fu choreography with the occasional crotch shot thrown in. (Not a complaint, to be clear.) When it comes to breaking the wheel, Ballerina’s greatest addition to the franchise is a climactic set piece involving multiple characters firing flamethrowers at one another—a moment that, for an action sicko like myself, was akin to a religious experience. (I wouldn’t be surprised if Ballerina set a Guinness World Record for the most stunt performers set on fire in a film.) Wick, meanwhile, is utilized like a closer, arriving in Ballerina’s final stretch to remind audiences that he’s one of one.', 'It’s certainly encouraging that John Wick hasn’t lost its fastball on the big screen, especially when there’s another spinoff film in the works—this time centered on Donnie Yen’s blind assassin, Caine—as well as John Wick 5. (“It will be really different, and everybody [will] see the trailer and go, ‘Holy fuck … I gotta see that,’” Stahelski said of the fifth John Wick. My body is ready.) It’s been a much different story, however, for the John Wick imitators. The Netflix Wicks (motion to call them the Netwicks?) have all underwhelmed, while the theatrical releases have been trending in the wrong direction. The Quan-led Love Hurts was flimsy and one-dimensional, far and away the worst movie I’ve watched this year—and I saw Captain America: Brave New World. As thrilling as it was to experience Bob Odenkirk: Action Star, I doubt many people were clamoring for a Nobody sequel where his protagonist goes on a bloody vacation. ', 'The genre has become overstuffed with these types of films, leading to an encroaching feeling of John Wick action fatigue. With Ballerina, the John Wick movies themselves remain unimpeachable, but the imitators are just that—imitators. I’d see my favorite artist in concert as many times as I could; I wouldn’t do the same for a cover band. The hope is that, The Continental notwithstanding, John Wick can continue to avoid diminishing returns—that every extension meets the high bar set by the franchise’s action sequences. But the longer that John Wick goes on, the greater the risk is that these movies will hit a wall that even the Baba Yaga can’t overcome. (It took months of reshoots for Ballerina to stick the landing, after all.) The Wickification of action cinema only exacerbates the issue.', 'Of course, this predicament isn’t exclusive to John Wick: As we’ve seen with the superhero genre, when something makes bank, every major studio will follow suit and flood the market. Now, Wick-style fight choreography is no longer a novelty in Hollywood—it’s been strip-mined to the extent that Santa Claus stabbing goons with a candy cane fails to make a lasting impression. Since watching the first John Wick in college—a moviegoing experience I’ll cherish for the rest of my life—the franchise has earned enough goodwill that I’ll gladly follow it every step of the way. But just as superheroes are finally reckoning with audience fatigue after years of prosperity, the rest of the action genre could, in both a figurative and literal sense, use some fresh blood.\nEnd of article', 'Yep, we have one too', 'By submitting, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.', 'Most Read', 'The Knicks Ran Out of Gas—So They Lit the Car on Fire', 'The 2025 NBA Finals Entrance Survey', 'Lane Kiffin Crossed a Line.

Ballerina,https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/john-wick-ballerina-movie-review-2025,"['Reviews', '“Ballerina” is a halfway decent action movie that will suffer because it lives in the massive shadow of John Wick, one of the best modern franchises. It struggles to escape the spectacular, no-misses Keanu Reeves quadrilogy, especially when its weaknesses are matched up specifically with the strength of Chad Stahelski’s films. Yet, this young assassin has also learned a thing or two from her mentor. Much like “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” the first half of “Ballerina” requires more patience than the second, when action does the talking and even the editing/choreography tightens up. The last third of “Ballerina” is basically one extended, truly goofy action sequence, and it’s the kind of unpretentious fun that one wants from a movie subtitled “From the World of John Wick.”', 'Allegedly set between “John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum” and “John Wick: Chapter 4”—although, man, the timeline is weird given Wick’s appearances in this film and how 3 & 4 roll right into each other, but whatever—“Ballerina” features a character seen briefly in the first act of “Parabellum,” a dancer-assassin named Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas). After her father was murdered by a team of assassins led by the mysterious Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne), she was taken in by Winston Scott (Ian McShane) and delivered to the mysterious Director (Anjelica Huston), the head of the Ruska Roma, a tribe of assassins/bodyguards who can also do a plié.', 'The early action scenes in director Len Wiseman’s vision will be dispiriting for fans of a franchise that has redefined clean, tightly edited, long-shot action, avoiding the filmmaking traps that “Ballerina” falls into early on. Editing on the hits and swaying the camera to increase a sense of chaos are just two tricks designed to hide mediocre fight choreography and stunt work, and “Ballerina” uses those in ways the other four “Wick” films never did. To be fair, cinematographer Romain Lacourbas keeps his camera at a distance so we don’t lose track of the geography. But Jason Ballantine’s editing and that swinging camera stand out in the first few sequences, especially if you’ve seen a “Wick” film recently.', 'After a brief set-up in which Eve proves her worth in the field, “Ballerina” finally kicks in for real with a vengeance quest for the murder of her father. When she spots an assassin with the same mark as one of the men who killed her dad, she gets the kind of simple objective around which these films are built. It’s another tale of revenge: John Wick was going to make people pay for his dog; Eve Macarro is going to set the world on fire for her dad. She crosses paths with a severely underutilized Norman Reedus at a Prague Continental, who points her back to the Chancellor. As she burns his entire empire to the ground (often literally), the Director calls in Wick himself to shut her down.', 'Once Byrne’s Chancellor re-enters “Ballerina,” the loose elements of the plotting and even the action choreography tighten up significantly. There’s a sequence in a snow-covered restaurant that’s spectacularly entertaining, filled with the type of unexpected fight choreography and stunt work that people love from the Wick films. It follows not long after the film’s funniest beat, in which a TV cycles through some comedic influences on these films, including Buster Keaton and The Three Stooges. One can feel the energy of the film shift to such a degree that I wondered if Stahelski was on set that day, or at least in the editing bay. It’s tight, funny, and clever.', 'And “Ballerina” largely keeps that momentum for the last third of the film. The Wick return that’s been spoiled in the previews is a bit of a misstep—it feels more like fan service than anything the movie needs at that point—but Reeves has a bigger part in this film’s endgame than you might expect, and he still rules. As for performance, de Armas is capable without being overly memorable. One of the things that’s so great about how Reeves approaches the role is that you can see Wick struggle in combat (Reeves is 60 after all), which adds just enough flavor of realism to ground the Gun Fu flights of fancy. De Armas sometimes seems almost too fluid in the fight scenes, but she handles the dramatic beats well without trying to oversell them. On that note, the dialogue in Shay Hatten’s script is more eye-rolling than the rest of the franchise, often leaning into clichés when there isn’t time between action sequences to develop character. The Wick films use action (and a bit of mythology) to define their characters—we don’t need cheesy lines like “When you deal in blood, there must be rules.” Uh-huh. Sure. Whatever you say.', 'The dumbed-down nature of the dialogue extends to some aspects of the action, too. Dozens of masked, armed men in this movie just run through doors like they have targets on their faces. In one scene, they attack Eve in an armory! It’s maybe not the best tactical advantage to try to take out an assassin in a room full of grenades.', 'Of course, none of this matters when “Ballerina” is clicking, which it eventually does. Without spoiling, the final act of the film features Eve being hunted by an entire European village of people who want her dead. It’s fun, chaotic stunt work staged by silent comedy fans. Maybe this shouldn’t be seen as something outside of the shadow of John Wick, but a bridge from one film in that franchise to the next. In that sense, it’s sturdy enough to get us there.', 'Now streaming on:', 'Brian Tallerico is the Managing Editor of RogerEbert.com, and also covers television, film, Blu-ray, and video games.

According to the initial assessments, Ballerina could end up surpassing the domestic opening numbers of 2017’s John Wick: Chapter 2.', 'As per reports shared by Deadline, Ballerina, which boasts a reported production budget of $80-90 million, should conclude its first three-day run at the box office with a collection in excess of $30 million domestically. If the spin-off film manages to match the predicted number, it will beat the opening weekend numbers of the first two John Wick movies.', 'John Wick and John Wick: Chapter 2 raked in $14.4 million and $30.4 million, respectively, in their debut weekends in theaters.

Does 'John Wick 5' Come Next After 'Ballerina'?,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/does-john-wick-5-come-200000799.html,"['', '', '', '', '', '""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""', ""THE JOHN WICK franchise is going strong. Now spanning five movies and a TV series (and counting), it's clear that this is not only a violent, unique, and action-packed world, but one with just about endless possibilities. In fact, the latest film, From the World of John Wick: Ballerina (or, as we'll refer to it to avoid that clunky title, Ballerina) is proof that the franchise can explore new ground and succeed even without the titular Mr. Wick himself. Sure, Keanu Reeves is in the movie, but the main character is Ana de Armas's Eve—and watching her kick ass in a Wick-esque manner should fill any Keanu-size holes in your heart in the meantime."", ""It's clear that the Wick franchise will continue from here—it's just unknown in what direction. This is a series and brand that's now been making Lionsgate lots of money for over a decade, and with multiple recognizable stars in the fold, there are a bunch of ways things could go. For example, we know that we could do another John Wick movie, and now it seems more than possible that we could do another Ballerina movie. But there's also a spinoff film coming on the John Wick: Chapter 4 character Caine, played by Donnie Yen, which will also star Rina Sawayama's Akira (Yen will also direct)."", ""We've already gone down the road of a prequel; the little-watched limited series The Continental focused on the exploits of a younger Winston (Ian McShane). So that's probably not a road that will particularly be gone down, though Wick director Chad Stahelski and McShane don't think particularly highly of it. So maybe don't rule out some kind of re-do."", 'Again: the possibilities do feel kind of endless. But we know the primary question that everyone is going to be asking after Ballerina—will we be getting John Wick 5? And at this time we do seem to have a pretty definitive answer.', 'From the World of John Wick: Ballerina is set between the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. It picks up the character of ""The Director,"" played by Angelica Huston, who was introduced in Chapter 3, and, perhaps most notably, includes Keanu Reeves as played by John Wick. This is the key part of the equation, considering John Wick dies at the end of Chapter 4.', ""That would seem to signify a closed book, right? But as we've established, the possibilities in this world are pretty endless."", ""Most likely. Despite the titular character's death at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, Lionsgate officially announced that John Wick 5 was in the works at this year's CinemaCon back in April."", ""That being said, director Chad Stahelski is still a little apprehensive that the film will actually get made—because he wants to make sure it's as good as it can possibly be."", '""Look, everybody seems to want it,"" he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ""It’s a matter of whether we crack it. We’re actively working on it. It’s just … is it going to be satisfying?""', ""Throughout the conversation Stahelski repeatedly suggested that while they're early in the process on John Wick 5, it's still just that—early in the process. And that he hasn't even officially brought the idea to Reeves yet. Stahelski is meticulous, and holds himself to a high standard. And so he doesn't want to proceed with something until it's actually ready to proceed."", '""If we go down the road of John Wick 5 and build this story and decide this isn’t right, there are probably going to be 10 other things we’ll discover that we’ll use for other things,"" he says.', 'Which implies it still could not happen.

And it seems like for now the Caine spinoff, which has Donnie Yen attached to star and direct, Rina Sawayama attached to reprise her Akira character, and Mattson Tomlin attached to write, is much further along in production, and will certainly come first.', ""Now that much truly remains to be seen.

Ballerina Ruins John Wick's Bulletproof Mystique,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a64981689/ballerina-john-wick-keanu-reeves-cameo/,"['Discover Entertainment', 'The first spin-off of the John Wick franchise turns a mythical figure into an action toy.', ""Last October, a friend convinced me to download Fortnite. After dragging my feet for weeks—the thought of playing with and against anyone too young for a driver's license gives me hives—I caved. On my first night in the game, John Wick showed up in Fortnite's shop of rotating cosmetics. Turns out, Fortnite officially collaborated with the John Wick franchise to present a playable character that has the Point Break star's striking likeness. Anyone with $20 to burn could make their in-game avatar look like Keanu Reeves's vengeful antihero. And burned $20 I did. Because pissing off middle schoolers with the face of John Wick was worth every penny, failing economy be damned."", ""Fortnite, if you're unfamiliar, is a violent battle royal video game where players scavenge for weapons—guns, primarily—and kill each other until only one remains. It's an experience that rewards selfish survival, accomplished via pinpoint aim and luck. It's also a lucrative opportunity for branded collaboration. John Wick makes sense for Fortnite. But Lady Gaga, Superman, and Eleven from Stranger Things? Maybe less so."", ""But a funny thing happened on my way to victory royale: I realized John Wick is out of place, too. Never mind the guns and one-versus-all gameplay, all of which feel tailor-made for Wick. Looking through you sniper scopes and seeing your target is a muscular cat or a dude in a banana costume while you are John Wick is a jarring experience, hilarious as it may be. Mr. Wick is the square peg in the round hole that is Fortnite's memescape, if you will. I relished my time as John Wick, but the cartoonish environments made me stick out more than the man's blacked-out tailoring."", ""In short: An experience that feels right for John Wick doesn't mean that it is right for John Wick. Few places can welcome Mr. John Wick so easily, and that includes his own spin-offs. Yes, I'm talking about Ballerina, officially titled From the World of John Wick: Ballerina. It's the latest movie in the John Wick franchise and its first theatrical spin-off. (The less said about The Continental on Peacock, the better.) Taking over Reeves's spot on the posters is Ana de Armas as Eve, a fresh-faced graduate of the Ruska Roma, the underworld mob of assassins who both operate a ballet company as a front, and raised and trained John Wick. While on her own road to revenge, Eve is eventually pitted against Wick, who is basically on a side quest during John Wick: Chapter 3. For Ballerina, Reeves reprises his sharp-dressed killer in a part that lands awkwardly between gratuitous cameo and supporting lead."", ""Ballerina is a perfectly imperfect action movie. It's a franchise spin-off that exists in the shadow of its older sibling and just barely upholds the crushing weight of expectations. Ana de Armas doesn't exactly prove to be our generation's action heroine—that title still belongs to Charlize Theron—but she kicks plenty of butt, and she's never boring. Anybody itching for more John Wick (especially after his death in Chapter 4) will find their hunger pangs satisfied. But ironically, John Wick is Ballerina's Achilles' heel, and his sleepy cameo is a symptom to an even larger ailment: Our heroes just aren't special anymore."", ""It's hard to remember in hindsight, but John Wick was a cultural sensation. During its release in October 2014, it was a surprise mega-hit that revitalized Reeves's career to rewrite the language of big-screen action for the next decade at least. While its tactical fight choreography had audiences buzzing, its popularity cemented John Wick, the character, as an era-defining figure. Not since Clint Eastwood has there been an onscreen protagonist who radiates mystique and keeps it that way even through many installments bearing his name. John Wick had the goods from the moment some dumbass mobsters cracked his dog's neck."", ""It's been nothing short of a miracle how the four John Wick films have maintained its protagonist's appeal. Of course, dilution through lesser sequels is a fate suffered by many of John Wick's predecessors, from Rambo to McClane. (Perhaps the continuity of authorship has been key; ex-Reeves stuntman Chad Stahelski has thus far directed all of the series' main movies.) It matters is that each Reeves-led effort has maintained is exceptional standard in an era of Hollywood's obvious desperation for stability. No one expected John Wick to be a franchise. That's why its transformation into one has felt more natural than any failed would-be cinematic universe."", 'But Ballerina is the first time John Wick doesn\'t seem bulletproof. Watch Ballerina and it\'s painfully obvious where and when it pivots to be ""more like"" its sibling franchise. The isolation of de Armas and Reeves in a snow-frosted graveyard comes out of nowhere—a left turn on a track that had only been swerving right the entire time. There\'s nothing wrong about the scene itself, but simply adding more John Wick to artificially sell a standalone movie is a maddening IP play from a franchise that\'s gone to great lengths to seem better than that.', ""I know the movie business is harder now than ever. Too many modern moviegoers demand assurance that the thing they've paid money for has the scent of familiarity. But if we actually care about the integrity of stories and the power of characters, someone would have stopped and said: Now hold up, John Wick is dead. His words of advice to get the hell out of the Ruska Roma would have, and should have, been enough. Instead, we're treated to more John Wick. Unfortunately, just like his predecessors, more is less."", 'I don\'t know if John Wick should stand on a pedestal. Nothing ought to be so sacred—not even fictional movie characters. But isn\'t it goddamn annoying? Isn\'t it silly when graves are desecrated, and finality means nothing? In 2008, I wept when wrestling legend Ric Flair was kicked in the face by Shawn Michaels to end his career. When Flair turned up in 2022 for another event billed as his ""final match,"" I only rolled my eyes. In 2017, I felt the gravity of Hugh Jackman leaving the X-Men behind in the masterpiece that was Logan. In 2024, I sat stone-faced during Deadpool & Wolverine.', ""We have worse problems as a society, but a refusal to accept the end is nigh is one of them. As of this writing, a fifth John Wick film is on the (high) table, but even Keanu Reeves hasn't been clued into what it's about. The arrogance of green-lighting a film without knowing the story is how we reached this sorry state of popular cinema in the first place. This is how beloved characters become plastic action figures.

Ballerina: a lifeless John Wick spin-off,https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/reviews/ballerina-lifeless-john-wick-spin,"['Starring Ana de Armas as an assassin, the latest addition to the John Wick universe features lacklustre action, heavy-handed storytelling and underwhelming performances.', '“Fight like a girl,” the heroine of Ballerina is instructed. Apparently, taken to its logical conclusion (to the extent that any movie set in the John Wick universe can be said to have a logical conclusion) this imperative means duelling with flamethrowers and using ice skates like bayonets, impressively inventive bits of carnage in a movie whose body count is in triple digits before the end of the first act. The only thing more extreme than the violence in Len Wiseman’s film – the second Wick spin-off after the underwhelming series The Continental (2023) – is the blitheness with which it gets dished out; if it’s possible for a film to be both bloody and bloodless, Ballerina sticks the landing. ', 'The only bit of gore that really hurts in Ballerina is the first: a close-up on the mutilated toes of Eve (Ana de Armas), the revenge-minded orphan introduced – under a different name and played by a different actress – in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019). That film’s director, Chad Stahelski, reportedly oversaw extensive reshoots on Ballerina, which may be why it feels so of a piece with its predecessor – a victory in and of itself. Over-elaborate, fan-service backstory is the lingua franca of 21st-century franchise filmmaking, and it’s amusing how much exposition is required to fill in the literal blank of de Armas’s stoic, dead-eyed character. ', 'Our Eve is grieving the murder of her father, a seemingly good dude despite his shady connections (he was planning on going straight right before catching a bullet). Rescued by Winston Scott (again played by Ian McShane) and offered sanctuary at the Continental Hotel (neutral ground for the criminal underworld), she’s swiftly recruited by the Ruska Roma and their mercenary matriarch the Director (Anjelica Huston), who wants to cultivate the kid’s killer instinct. ', 'Cut to Eve’s decade-plus of training, a montage smartly juxtaposing different ways to discipline and weaponise one’s body. Meanwhile, as a symbol of lost innocence, Eve carries around a music box that plays Tchaikovsky – a wry overture for an aspiring literal nut-cracker. At first, Eve does as the Director tells her, bumping off various mobsters en masse and earning her stripes in the form of tattoos. When one of her many (many) vanquished henchmen turns out to have a connection to the underworld kingpin (Gabriel Byrne) who presided over her dad’s death, Eve sees red and goes rogue, cutting ties with the Director and stocking up on weapons in the armouries that serve, videogame like, as save points in a relentlessly sidescrolling adventure. Ostensibly, she’s seeking out Byrne’s Chancellor, who’s up to his old habits of trying to kidnap little girls, although the real intrigue lies in whether or not Eve will come face to face with you-know-who. ', 'Given the movie’s marketing, it’s not a spoiler to say that Keanu is indeed on hand, contributing a short but welcome cameo that serves as a sort of certificate of authenticity. He’s there to pass the torch, but Eve already has her flamethrower. ', 'The funniest thing about the John Wick movies – the way that they take place in a twilight world where seemingly every other person on the street is a member of some kind of secret society with its own clandestine codes and forms of currency – gets doubled down on in Ballerina. In the final act, the action migrates to a remote Alpine town whose inhabitants are all packing heat: not just the local Swat team, but bakers, barmaids, you name it. The tension between the material’s inherent goofiness and the story’s pushy sentimental beats gets gruelling, and so, frankly, does the close-quarters fight choreography. It’s always nice to see Byrne, who’s been scarce since Hereditary (2018), but he doesn’t have much juice as a Big Bad, while Huston chews her dialogue desultorily, like a bored kid playing with her food. ', 'Ideally, Ballerina would vibrate with a sense of urgency, but the prevailing vibe is closer to obligation. Ultimately, the only things at stake here are continuity and the possibility of the series’ continuation. The late image of Eve’s name written next to an outrageous sum of money succinctly sums up the ruthless and self-reflexively mercenary nature of the entire enterprise.', '► Ballerina is in UK cinemas from 6 June.', 'News, reviews and archive features every Friday, and information about our latest magazine once a month.', ""On the cover: A world exclusive interview with Tom Cruise \n\nInside: The latest edition of Black Film Bulletin, Wes Anderson on The Phoenician Scheme, the career of Mai Zetterling, the legacy of the Film Society, archive of the story of Japan's new wave, Andres Veiel in conversation, BFI’s Film on Film festival"", 'By Tara Judah', 'By Francesca Steele', 'By Nicolas Rapold', 'We are a cultural charity, a National Lottery funding distributor, and the UK’s lead organisation for film and the moving image.', '©2025 British Film Institute.

And I remember they asked me to rehearse the day before filming and I was like, ‘No, that's not necessary.

The John Wick spin-off Ballerina adds some fresh moves to the series’ formula,https://www.polygon.com/review/603959/ballerina-review-john-wick-formula-ana-de-armas-keanu-reeves,"['Keanu Reeves steps back and Ana de Armas steps up in a John Wick series installment that tries to back-burner John Wick', 'BY TASHA ROBINSON', 'Deep into the action of Len Wiseman’s action-thriller Ballerina, there’s a moment that clearly places the action within the continuity of the John Wick movies, starring Keanu Reeves as a former assassin who tries and fails to get out of the killer game. Ballerina protagonist Eve (Ana de Armas) eavesdrops as her patron (Anjelica Huston, credited only as “The Director”) meets with John Wick, who’s seeking sanctuary and aid, in a sequence seen from his point of view in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. “All this, and for what? Because of a puppy,” The Director tuts. “It wasn’t just a puppy,” John Wick grouses.', 'It’s a winking reminder of how far this series has come from the simplicity of Chad Stahelski’s 2014 franchise-starter John Wick, a stripped-down vengeance thriller where the dude on a roaring rampage of revenge is avenging the beagle pup his dead wife left him, after a gangster (Alfie Allen, rarely sleazier) kills it in a smirking act of cruelty. John Wick still holds up today as a slick, simple kill-’em-all actioner, mostly notable for its spirit of unrelenting cool and its “stunt man becomes director, goes ham on stunts” approach to sleek, stunning fight choreography.', 'A decade-plus later, that straightforward thriller has spawned three sequels, a prequel TV series, multiple video games and comics, and an in-the-works anime project, along with the “set in the world of” side project Ballerina. The series’ lore has become ridiculously baroque. The action sequences keep getting more elaborate and ambitious. In an endlessly expanding franchise setting centering most specifically and directly on the combat skills of one man — either John Wick or Keanu Reeves, depending on who you ask — Wiseman and the Ballerina team had their work cut out for them in finding a corner of this world that another character could definitively own, and in pushing that character to the forefront of the story.', 'Ballerina may not satisfy all the John Wick stalwarts — in part because it doesn’t center on the stone-faced dude who wants it known that he wasn’t just defending a puppy, and in part because plenty of fans are going to go in dubious about the movie’s long development, production delays, and Stahelski stepping in for what news outlets have called extensive reshoots, and Wiseman has called “additional photography.” But the movie does have its own satisfying angles, thanks to two things the filmmakers do radically differently from the rest of the franchise — and one thing they take straight from the series’ heart.', 'Ballerina’s primary distinction in the Wickiverse is that Eve isn’t an assassin: If anything, she’s an anti-assassin, trained to protect innocent targets from the kinds of thugs, goons, and elegant hired killers who seem to make up 98 percent of the Wickiverse’s citizens around the world. After some of those thugs-and-goons, led by one of those elegant killers (Gabriel Byrne, similarly credited as “The Chancellor”), murder Eve’s father when she’s still a child, franchise regular Winston (Ian McShane) takes her to The Director to train as a kikimora — mythologically, a Slavic house spirit, but in this setting, a capable killer of killers who go after helpless targets.', 'In practice, at least, the Wikiverse difference between “assassin” and “anti-assassin” is little more than notional. Eve is trained to protect her targets and shepherd them through dangerous situations, but she’s also seen behaving like any other hired killer, using the same network the rest of them use to pick their targets, and accepting payment after a hit. And Eve herself almost immediately abandons her duties to go seek revenge on the group that killed her father. But while Ballerina doesn’t lean hard enough into the kikimora concept, the idea of an entire shadow organization of anti-assassins who actually value life brings something new into this franchise — characters who might pass as heroes instead of anti-heroes. The distinction also adds a little more soul and vulnerability to Eve, making her something other than just a gender-swapped Joanna Wick.', 'Ballerina’s second big twist on the franchise standards is in foregrounding Eve’s physical weakness in almost every face-off, from her training bouts to her first real mission to the near-nonstop action of the third act. It’s inescapably obvious that Eve, trained as a ballerina alongside all the other female kikimora (for reasons never explained within this movie), is thin and slight compared to most of her adversaries, and can’t match their strength. Sometimes this means she gets creative about holds, throws, and dodges, climbing her opponents like Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in the MCU movies, all in order to throw her full weight into unbalancing them. Sometimes it just means she gets the stuffing kicked out of her.', 'That latter element is mirrored from the John Wick movies, but it plays differently when a notably unkillable assassin in a bulletproof suit takes some brutal hits, and when the same thing happens to a woman who clearly shows the pain she’s fighting through in every sequence. Eve doesn’t have John Wick’s stoicism or air of exasperated weariness — she comes across as vulnerable emotionally as well as physically. When John Wick fights in his movies, he’s trying to survive. When Eve fights, she’s trying to survive — and prove to herself and her trainers that she isn’t a failure.', 'Those two distinctions — Eve’s characterization and her place in this world of contract killers — gives Ballerina some distinctive flavor to balance out all the ways in which it’s just another familiar revenge movie, full of questionable or casually glossed-over plot hooks, waves of exposition that doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny, and what sometimes sounds like first-draft dialogue that no one scanned over for continuity. (Regarding the “cult” that killed Eve’s father, The Director says they obey none of the rules that the rest of this world’s clans follow. Then she immediately starts speechifying about the rules that keep the cult and her clan, the Ruska Roma, separate from and safe from each other.)', 'But while Ballerina’s wafer-thin plot leaves a thousand open questions about how this world could possibly work (honestly, another Wickiverse trademark), and several of the plot beats make no sense (like Winston casually breaking the rules of his vaunted, beloved assassin-safehouse hotel The Continental), in the end, most audiences are only really going to care about, and remember, Ballerina’s fight sequences. And while they aren’t all stunning — particularly in the draggy first act, as Eve learns to fight — the movie builds up to some sequences that stand out among the franchise’s most ambitious, wild efforts.', 'In particular, an extended third-act sequence involving multiple flamethrowers — and eventually, an improvised anti-flamethrower weapon — counts among the most brutal, surprising, and at times thrilling sequences the John Wick movies have ever seen. Again, there’s significant irony to positioning Eve as an altruistic protector of the innocent in a movie where she stalks screaming, burning, fleeing victims in order to blast them over and over with sheets of fire. (Technically, you can argue that she’s doing it on behalf of an innocent child nearby, but she rarely seems particularly concerned with her charge’s safety; the kid is an absolute afterthought compared to Eve’s revenge.)', 'And Ballerina certainly focuses in on the kind of close-quarters vicious brawling that’s been the franchise’s hallmark since the first John Wick, whether Eve is sliding around on a sheet of ice, fighting an opponent with improved ice-skate nunchucks, or going blow for blow in a lower-stakes, fairly comic moment where she and an enemy smash plates over each other’s heads, trying to find the one that’s covering a dropped pistol.', 'Ballerina doesn’t hold up to much scrutiny. Its additions to John Wick’s story throughout his extended cameos are minimal, and fans will certainly be arguing whether his behavior makes much sense. The film’s expansions on the Wickiverse mythology are delivered with intense sincerity, but they’re contradictory and halfhearted. Its plot holes are many and manifest.', 'Even so, it’s hard to believe at this point that anyone really goes to a John Wick-related movie to learn more about this world’s many far-flung factions and how they intertwine. There’s a glib, self-satisfied baddie, an absolute horde of minions with different fighting styles, a vendetta, and fight after fight after fight.

With the advent of digital filmmaking, this is a much easier task than it was in the days of actual film.', 'That’s right, reshoots have been around since the industry began, and they can be done for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they’re done in the name of “making the film better.” Sometimes they’re done because of situations no one could control. There can be other reasons, but those are the usual main ones. Yet, no matter the reason, the results have always been a mixed bag.', 'Surprisingly, great films have come of this. Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo lost its original lead actor to illness and had to reshoot all his scenes. Tarkovsky’s Stalker had to scrap everything when it was discovered the footage was developed incorrectly. Back to the Future originally starred Eric Stoltz, and we all know how that turned out.', 'Of course, where there’s good, there’s bound to be bad. The prequel film to The Exorcist was disliked by the studio so much that they commissioned a totally new one with a different director, and when that one failed they tried to save face by releasing the first one. Jaws 2, Wes Craven’s Cursed, the 2015 Fantastic Four are all examples of reshoots failing to save the final product. I barely want to mention it, but the most infamous has to be the debacle surrounding the two versions of Justice League.', 'The new spin-off from the John Wick franchise, Ballerina, was also caught up in “making the film better” reshoots. Let’s see if they succeeded.', 'When Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) was a little girl, she watched her father die at the hands of a group of men with X scars on their wrists, led by the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne).

While on a job, she is attacked by men with the X scar. When the Director refuses to tell her which tribe this represents, Eve goes on her own mission to find the man responsible for her father’s death.', 'Ballerina is credited to director Len Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free or Die Hard), but it’s been reported that producer Chad Stahelski (also director of the four John Wick films) took over and reshot a big portion of the film to punch it up, which delayed the release by about a year.', 'The result? This time it appears to have been a good decision, because Ballerina is an all-out banger of an action film. While it has to abide by the rules firmly set by the universe created around the Wick films, it does a stand-up job of standing out as its own thing.', '(In case you’re wondering, Ballerina is set between Wick 3 and 4, which explains Keanu’s appearance…sort of.

Everyone else is there to be exactly the character they’ve either played before for us, or play what is needed for their characterization, such as with Byrne’s villainous turn. Even though he has very little screen time, it was really nice, and bittersweet, to see Lance Reddick in his final filmed role.', 'With it being a Wick franchise entry, you know the action is going to big, bombastic and exciting, especially in a scene that feels like it was totally conceived to top the great moment in John Wick 4with the flame-spewing shotgun.

Ballerina's Director Made Sure That Flamethrower Fight Was As Real As Possible [Exclusive Interview],https://www.slashfilm.com/1873769/ballerina-director-explains-flamethrower-fight-interview/,"['', 'I admittedly had doubts about ""Ballerina"" going in, and for the first few minutes of the movie, I was very worried. The film stumbles out of the gate, but thankfully, it eventually finds its footing and settles into a nice groove. Overall, it\'s not nearly as operatic as the main ""John Wick"" movies have become; Chad Stahelski infuses those films with such an idiosyncratic assortment of influences that they\'ve become these epic, larger-than-life tales that sometimes feel more like myths than movies. ', '""Ballerina,"" directed by Len Wiseman, is more of a down-and-dirty, back-to-basics revenge tale. It feels more zeroed in on its protagonist — more personal, less mythological — and Ana de Armas, who plays a member of the Ruska Roma out for her own vengeance, proves she can not only hang with ""John Wick"" franchise star Keanu Reeves (who appears in a supporting role), but she kicks so much ass that it makes her appearance in ""No Time to Die"" look like child\'s play. There are a couple of action scenes that are among my favorites in the entire franchise, and as a lifelong action movie junkie, I can safely say there are things here I\'ve never seen before in any other action film.', 'A few weeks ago, I caught up with Wiseman over Zoom to talk about those action scenes (including a flamethrower fight he says was ""practical"" and used ""real fire""), what movies influenced the ""Ballerina"" aesthetic, that report claiming Chad Stahelski came in and reshot a huge percentage of the film, and more.', 'Note: This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity, and contains spoilers for ""Ballerina.""', '', ""I would love to hear you talk about the visual aesthetic of this film, which is very different than what we've seen from other films set in this universe."", 'Len Wiseman: The aesthetic was, it was twofold. There were some elements and scenes that directly cross over to ""Parabellum,"" the third film. So in that, I wanted that to feel of the same world, because literally looking at different perspectives, recreating sets to see some iconic moments from a different perspective. ', 'Then aside from that, being able to create other looks and experiences through also the locations that we\'re choosing. So we\'ve never seen a snow-heavy sequence in ""John Wick,"" so my DP and I took a lot of time about how you do keep a kind of noir, neo-noir feeling in snow. Snow is white, it\'s bright. We\'re shooting some of the stuff in the daytime. So what we\'re doing with the color balance of that to make it still feel like it\'s part of the world, whereas, say, a Bond film is a very different snow-looking aesthetic than ""Ballerina."" So that was also a challenge, to also make it look daunting. It\'s a beautiful city, and then you cover it in snow and it looks like a winter wonderland. So bringing mood into that city. A lot of tricks and elements. Also shooting with the elements, the spotlights became a large portion of just our source for how it backlights. But the goal there was how to give a noir, sexy, cool feeling to bright white snow, was a challenge.', 'Did you look at any movies specifically that did the kind of thing you were going for?', 'I did. It was actually, it was the second movie to, oh, what\'s the ... ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?""', 'Oh yeah.', 'The other one. There were some snow sequences there. I checked out ""30 Days of Night,"" just to see what they did with that. Yeah, so I dive in. I get to a point where, when I\'m making a movie, the movies that I do watch are always some form of research. So I have a lot of movies to actually catch up on now that this is done, because I just don\'t feel like — why would I watch a movie? I know entertainment and I love movies, but I always, I\'m so in it, [in] the world [of making my film], that every movie I watch has some form of research involved in it.', '', 'So there was a report that came out a while back that claimed that Chad Stahelski came in and reshot most of this movie. And I was just curious if you could talk about what happened from your perspective.', 'Yeah. One, there weren\'t reshoots. They were additional shoots that we went out to Budapest. The studio saw the film, loved the film, and we had cut out some of the action sequences from the original script just because we couldn\'t fit them in the schedule. So once they saw the movie and really believed in it, they were like, ""Why don\'t we take a look at bringing those sequences back in?"" So a large part of what we shot was what was in the script originally. And yeah, no, the rumors are rumors. I\'ve known Chad for a long time, and I ended up, I got sick. I had a health scare, so I had to take off for a couple of weeks and go to the hospital, and so he covered the scenes that we were working on, and kind of thank God that he was there with the team for that, so. And then after my stay in the hospital, I jumped back in, but that\'s actually what the personal story is.', ""Gotcha. Okay. Well, thanks for sharing. There's a pretty lengthy sequence where Eve is fighting with a guy who's using a flamethrower and she's using a flamethrower, and it looks like there's actual fire being used there. I especially enjoyed the moment where the guy purposefully catches his leg on fire so he can kick her with it."", 'Oh yeah, so he can kick her? Yeah. It\'s just a tough move. It\'s like, it doesn\'t need to happen, but it\'s just an extra level of, ""You know what, f*** it. Let me just do this."" [mimics kicking] But it is real fire. That\'s a practical sequence.', ""I was wondering about that. Because people can do amazing stuff with CG, but there's something about fire where you can tell when it's real, and it certainly looked real. So aside from the safety angle, what kind of conversations went into the creation of that scene?"", 'Well, one of the things that was really [important] is always striving to do something different, something that we haven\'t seen. So we\'ve seen a flamethrower in an action movie here and there, but never as a gun battle, a close-quarters, indoors, just a gun battle with flamethrowers. Never seen it. So it really comes from that, of that conversation of how to take a weapon that ... there\'s only so many weapons to play with. So it\'s really about, what\'s the clever idea? What is the clever situation, location, of how to make that difference? Much like what we were also doing with the grenades. Yes, we\'ve seen grenades in action movies before, but I pitched this as, ""What if it was a snowball fight, but with grenades? Also indoors, close-quarters."" So then it creates a scene that is entirely new. I don\'t think we\'ve seen anything like that. We haven\'t seen anything like the flamethrowers. So it\'s really coming from that perspective: How do we make this different?', '', 'Man, I love that grenade scene so much. How many different variations of the choreography do you guys go through once you settle on, ""Okay, we\'re only using grenades""? You\'re limited in terms of like, ""What can I actually do where my protagonist is not going to be obliterated by this?"" So how many different variations did you end up going through there?', ""I mean, one, it was a lot of fun building that dynamic because they are grenades, so even the set and the setting, the steel doors, it was built out of, it's all a rock-based underground bunker. So you start from there where you could actually shelter yourself just behind a door. But I just went kind of nuts on the lobbing, almost volleyball aspect of just a hot potato kind of sequence. So the set itself, we built with a lot of — because [we also have] a lot of continuous takes, so there were a lot of trap doors in the set. So like when the guy gets pushed behind the door, we don't cut. Ana pushes the door closed, and he goes through a little magic trap door right before the explosion goes off, because it's a real explosion. So it's a bit, I felt like it was almost like little theater tricks that we would do as we're blowing people up."", ""That's really cool. So there are several other extended fight sequences here that I think action junkies are just going to really enjoy and I wanted to run through a few of them with you in a lightning round format and see if you could just tell me any stories from the set or moments that you discovered during editing or really anything that jumps out to you about these. So there's this hard-hitting fight scene that takes place in an ice club, which again was something that I'd never seen before. So what do you remember about that?"", 'I mean, that\'s something that was, in terms of using elements that are there, of what would be in an ice club? Part of it is just grabbing weapons, because when she comes in, she can\'t have a real gun, so she has to use the rubber bullets. So that was a unique idea too of, again, taking something like, say she had a gun. Say she had a gun in the club. It would feel like something we\'ve seen before, outside of the ice club [aspect], but using the rubber bullets established this idea of, with metal detectors, you just can\'t go there. So what do we do? So using the rubber bullets, what she practiced with in the Ruska Roma, that becomes a different kind of sequence. So it\'s almost like punching with bullets. Just driving and just pop, pop, pop, you\'re having to drive them back as if you\'re hitting them. So that became a new thing. ""What about if we\'re punching with bullets, what would that look like?""', ""That's great. And then there's also this scene that takes place in this kind of lodge environment, which we've never really seen in a John Wick movie before. What do you remember about that one?"", 'We had a great time with it, and I really wanted this, I had this image early on of a silhouette samurai, just wild Ana, wild Eve, just getting out all of her anger in one tableau of her going to town. So using the fire specifically — having the grenade that goes off, but then it does roll by the fireplace, so I needed the place to be on fire, mainly because I wanted that silhouette shot. So that\'s kind of how you go through it. You have these ideas, I go, ""Okay, so the cabin has to be on fire because I want this tableau shot.""', '', ""The last big one that I wanted to talk about is Eve's fight against Keanu as John Wick. What was shooting that like? Because Ana and Keanu had worked together before, they had a previous acting relationship. So what was it like from your perspective, putting that scene together?"", 'One, I was thrilled that we got it because at [one] time, we weren\'t sure how extensive we could go with it. But I\'ve got to say, they\'re both so committed. Also, again, it was a practical location. It is freezing. All the breath and the fog and everything is all real. And I had a great time. They were very, I think they enjoyed it. So, it\'s hard. It\'s all hard. It\'s all very hard work. But that one was really enjoyable, and it was also the first scene that I had directed, first fight scene that I had directed with Keanu. So that was just a thrill for me as a fan, as a filmmaker, to go, ""All right, today, we\'re playing around with John Wick."" It was wonderful.', 'Awesome. Okay, so I think I have time for one more question, and I want to go back to the very first time that you read the script. Was there a specific scene or moment on the page that you were especially excited to tackle?', ""The town, I think. The town was the thing, because a lot of the action I will restructure and build myself, so the thing that I really took from it was that the town and the tribe felt much more like a cult than any tribe we've seen in this world. That their code is different. That fascinated me. I come from a religious background, and if my family's [reading], it just wasn't for me. But there's elements of, it's treated more like a religion than it is an assassin tribe. And so, not to say that I grew up in a cult, but there's a cult aspect to it. I said it's almost if David Koresh was running an assassin congregation."", '""Ballerina"" is in theaters now.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5UWHBpZWs5a1lUWnZOMjR4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhVko1NW9HZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

I think it's, you know, for the most part, the training is more focused on the fights. You know, the physical fights and the choreos and knives and guns and all that. But I never got to practice with a flamethrower, and I definitely [...] the fire. It's a scary thing. And I remember they asked me to rehearse the day before filming and I was like, ‘No, that's not necessary.

Ana de Armas improvises weapons and her own take on Wick-world in winning spin-off Ballerina,https://www.avclub.com/ballerina-review,"['The dumbest move in Ballerina, an action-movie spinoff from the John Wick series, comes when a scene from John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum plays out within earshot of Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas). It’s not that this moment constitutes the lazy fan service some might have feared upon realizing that Ballerina really would involve the limited participation of Keanu Reeves playing the “Baba Yaga” assassin himself. In fact, the shoehorning is kind of cute, like when the Marty McFly of Back To The Future Part II sees a scene from the earlier movie play out in front of him. No, the problem is that when the audience and Eve overhear the Director (Anjelica Huston), the forbidding headmistress of a school for murderous ballerinas, mention Wick’s original motivation (“All this over a puppy?”), there’s an immediate jolt of recognition around how pedestrian Eve’s in-progress backstory has been by comparison.', 'It doesn’t seem that way to Eve, of course. Early in her life, her father attempts to take her away from the mysterious, cult-like organization with ties to her already-dead mother; he’s killed in the process, leaving Eve alone and grieving. Winston (Ian McShane), the owner of the underworld-friendly New York Continental Hotel, steers her toward the Director’s school, where she is trained to dance, fight, and kill. (Within the school’s walls, at least, it’s the dancing that looks the bloodiest.)', '', 'The reasons behind any and all of that training remain murky. The ballet company’s repertoire seems limited to ballets that the filmmakers imagine the average moviegoer has heard of (so, mostly just Swan Lake). Their more clandestine operations are vaguely described as protection gigs, like they’re bodyguard version of the contract killers Wick used to run with, but who hires them, how much leeway they’re given with their deadliness, why they need the ballet-company front, and whether they are unionized are among the questions that go unanswered. When Eve’s mentor urges her to shift her strategy to “fight like a girl,” the movie seems too cautious to fully define what that means for the characters. Eventually, a possible working definition emerges: Maybe it’s a cross between Jackie Chan prop work and slasher-style gimmick kills? Eve does maintain a certain scrappiness when she’s backed into a corner; it’s not panic, exactly, but she betrays a little more desperation than the precision grace of Wick (who, yes, does pop up again later in this film, which by that point has improved enough that it doesn’t really need him). Ultimately, though, the movie doesn’t give much thought to the gendering of its action, and the line is mainly fodder to inspire the lyrics for one of two (!) end-credit Evanescence songs.', 'Evanescence isn’t the only Elektra-coded element of Ballerina. It shares with that movie and so many other lady-centric action pictures a conviction that the softer, more feminine side of ruthless ass-kicking must involve an imperiled child. When attempting to track down the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne), the leader of the group that killed her father, Eve comes across his latest victim—another potentially orphaned young girl—ostensibly to give her mission of revenge greater emotional heft. Yet none of this stuff, largely but not exclusively confined to a rote opening 30 minutes or so, works as well as the seemingly lower-stakes but far more evocatively handled saga of John Wick’s dog. The rest of the series builds out from that groundwork in the first film so that Wick, no matter how superhuman his abilities may seem, feels like some kind of a human being; Eve, by comparison, mostly feels like a character in a vengeful-woman action movie.', '', 'Ah, but as such a movie, Ballerina has the necessary chops; it’s not quite Atomic Blonde, but it outdoes the straight-to-streaming actioners that already tried for a daughter-of-Wick feel. The film underwent some reshoots and/or additional photography last year, reportedly to pump up its action sequences; whether director Len Wiseman or Wick overseer Chad Stahelski ultimately spent more time behind the camera, they’ve engineered a great bunch of them, sending de Armas through a gauntlet of shoot-outs, flamethrower duels, and kitchenware melees, accented with plenty of snowflakes, explosions, and neon club lighting. Stahelski productions may have a familiar bag of tricks at this point, but their variations are blessedly well-crafted; anyone sick of low-contrast color schemes and hazy lighting in big-budget fantasies should take refuge in -world.', '', '', '', '', 'GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.', '', 'Sign Up', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Paste Media Group.

One of its stars, Ian McShane, confirmed in an interview that Stahelski came onboard to ""protect the franchise.""', ""He did what he could. Whenever the movie is in hyper-violent action mode, it's a lot of fun.

Keeping with franchise tradition, it does appear that Ana de Armas does a lot of her own fighting and stunt work, and it looks great.', 'While the reshoots clearly added the fluid action that works, they also added in John Wick himself in a way that felt unneeded, taking away from the lead character’s story.', 'I guess the writing was on the wall when the title changed from Ballerina to From the World of John Wick: Ballerina.', '🍿 What critics are saying: Don\'t come for the storyline! Variety\'s Owen Gleiberman called the plot of Ballerina ""pure trash,"" with the Los Angeles Times\'s Amy Nicholson calling it ""a snooze."" That said, the fight scenes get high marks.

Let me explain: Jai Courtney plays a serial killer, and his method of killing people is to feed them to sharks. He films these killings because to him, the “greatest show on Earth” is watching sharks, one of the ocean’s most majestic creatures, do what comes naturally to them when a warm, bloodied human body is lowered into the waters.', 'The movie mostly focuses on the final girl trapped on his boat as she tries to free herself before the next feeding. What more do you need to know?', '🍿 What critics are saying: The reception has been largely positive; Kristy Puchko at Mashable says Jai Courtney is a ""rip-roaring force of nature"" and praises the film as ""a satisfying, sick, and devilishly smart thriller.""

Yes, it’s a vampire movie, but it takes half the film to get there — extreme From Dusk Till Dawn vibes — and before that, it’s a period piece gangster movie that patiently sets up the stakes of its story.', 'In the end, what’s revealed is that the movie works entirely on its own terms as a spectacle — about a bunch of people holing up in a single location and warding off invaders — but it also works on an entirely different level: as a metaphor about its director’s feelings on making art as a Black man in an industry that’s eager to exploit his perspective. Calling it a musical is a stretch, but it has a blues element that pays off well.', 'Sinners is a hell of a swing, and even if things occasionally get messy or certain elements feel pushed to the side, its vision comes through so strong that it’s an incredibly impressive feat.', '🍿 What critics are saying: Sinners is also one of the best-reviewed films of the year and has a great shot at Oscar gold. David Sims at the Atlantic said it ""had [him] cheering for every thrill and spill, all while mulling the deeper concerns threaded through it"" and AP\'s Jocelyn Novek wrote, ""by far the most creatively ambitious, culturally layered, artistically bold twin-led cinematic outing yet — if this sentence feels like a lot, get ready for the movie!""', '👀 How to watch: Sinners is now available to rent or purchase on digital and on-demand.', ""Rent or buy 'Sinners'"", '🤔 If that’s not for you...', 'The Surfer: A Nicolas Cage-led, laugh-out-loud funny but also quite stressful descent into madness that recalls the Ozploitation classic Wake in Fright.

It's an anthology film that feels inspired by any number of viral tweets suggesting, “We need a Predator movie set in feudal Japan,” because that’s exactly what we get here."", 'We get three separate stories — one set in Viking times, one in feudal Japan and another set during World War II that’s essentially one long dogfight between U.S. soldiers and a huge terrifying Predator ship. The premise is quite simple. In each short, we learn about some badass who is the most badass fighter of their time, and then a Predator shows up to fight them.', 'The action is incredible, unencumbered by the limits of live-action and fully embracing the fact that it’s a cartoon, delivering everything you’d want to see in a Predator movie. There’s one sequence that legitimately may be the best scene in any one of these movies, period.', 'The stories do also come together in a very satisfying way.

Henson stars as a single mother facing a series of painful events in Tyler Perry's new movie, out now on Netflix. Netflix did not provide a review copy for critics."", 'My recommendation: Becoming Led Zeppelin', 'Why you should watch it: This one’s an easy sell: it’s a documentary about Led Zeppelin, featuring interviews with the surviving members of the band about their origins and their meteoric rise. It also features fantastic concert footage, much of which has never been seen before.', 'It’s a treat for Led Heads, even if the movie doesn’t get into any of the dirty details about the animosity between them that necessitates all members being interviewed separately over the course of the film and, of course, the fact that they haven’t played a show together since 2007. It’s a fun, rocking trip down memory lane; if you missed it in IMAX theaters, it’s now streaming on Netflix.', '🍿 What critics are saying: The reception has been largely positive; Steve Pond at the Wrap correctly notes that it ""offers glimpses of the band we’ve never seen before, but it also withholds a lot."" Joshua Rothkopf at the Los Angeles Times asks, ""Why are these guys so boring?"" and also laments that ""no other voices have been allowed,"" knocking the lack of historical context.', '👀 How to watch: Becoming Led Zeppelin is now streaming on Netflix.', 'Stream on Netflix', '➕ Bonus recommendation: Presence', 'Why you should watch it: Presence isn’t the horror movie it’s being marketed as, but it’s absolutely haunting and chilling in a different way.', 'Here, the camera is the ghost that’s haunting a house, and the entire movie takes place from that perspective. The viewers are along for the ride, limited to what the ghost knows and doesn’t know, as the lost soul tries to solve the case of its own death and figure out why it’s haunting this', 'What unfolds is a compelling family drama with moments of pure terror. It hits you on a deeper level and stays there rather than leave you screaming over a loud noise or a jump scare. It’s certainly a horror movie, just not the register we’ve come to expect from the premise of “family moves into a haunted house.” It cleverly ends up being a movie about parenting, among other themes.', 'Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter David Koepp are more interested in the dynamics between the family inhabiting the house than delivering cheap thrills, and it pays off with a gut-punch of an ending. The entire cast is great, but it’s particularly nice to see Lucy Liu again.', '🍿 What critics are saying: Critics love Soderbergh, and this time is no different. Stephanie Zacharek at Time writes, ""it’s so compact, smart, and elegant that it feels quietly momentous. Without handing everything over, it gives you all you need,"" though the Telegraph\'s Tim Robey was more mixed, writing that it\'s ""certainly not a bad time"" while taking issue with certain elements.', '👀 How to watch: Presence is now streaming on Hulu.', 'Stream on Hulu', '🤔 If those aren’t for you...', 'The Accountant 2: If you thought The Accountant was silly, hold on to your briefcase and pocket protector! Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal both return in the much, much goofier sequel, which leans into not only the humor but also becomes more of a hangout movie than you’d expect. Any grounding in reality is gone here, so your mileage may vary, even if you dug the first one. Now streaming on Amazon Prime.', ""Neighborhood Watch: Jack Quaid continues his streak of being in yet another movie where he’s out to save a kidnapped woman, This time, he plays a mentally ill man who teams up with his neighbor Jeffrey Dean Morgan to solve an abduction he witnesses. It's pretty fun! Now streaming on AMC+"", 'The Ballad of Wallis Island: This is a sweet and nice movie about a a lottery winner who lives alone on a remote island who dreams of getting his favorite musicians back together. His fantasy turns into reality when the bandmates and former lovers accept his invitation. Carey Mulligan is in it! Now streaming on Peacock.', 'The Alto Knights: The selling point of this movie is not only that Robert De Niro is returning to the mob movie genre, but that he\'s playing two distinct leading roles in it. The problem is, the characters are not related, so it\'s just a strange gimmick that never really makes sense outside of ""wouldn\'t it be fun to see De Niro play against himself?"" The movie is a familiar bore, but it\'s now on HBO Max, so if you\'re curious, it won\'t cost you anything extra. Now streaming on HBO Max.', ""What an exhaustive week!

Ballerina review – Ana de Armas racks up the kills as she pirouettes into John Wick spin-off,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/04/ballerina-review-ana-de-armas-racks-up-the-kills-as-she-pirouettes-into-john-wick-spin-off,"['De Armas is fun as a feisty assassin trained in ballet and martial arts, combining delicacy and violence in her quest for vengeance, with a cameo from Keanu. She doesn’t wear a tutu to fill goons with lead though', 'T\nhat title could cause confusion. The film might accidentally tap into the Frozen customer-base, and millions of wide-eyed little girls in sparkly tutus and tiaras will show up at cinemas with their mums and dads to watch Keanu Reeves let a heavy-set gangster have it in the chops with a round from his specially customised Glock. Well, the confusion is deliberate. Here, the delicacy of ballet and the violence of martial arts are conflated. In this new spin-off feature from Keanu’s John Wick action franchise – an auxiliary episode on the timeline, between Wick episodes Three and Four, when JW was lying low, recovering from injuries – a mysterious new action-slash-classical-dance heroine called Eve now grands-jetés her way into the franchise, played by the always stylish Ana de Armas. JW veteran Shay Hatten writes the screenplay and Len Wiseman directs.', 'The central idea returns me an old maxim of mine: people who call action scenes in films “balletic” have never seen a ballet, or indeed a fight, in their lives. Yet I was sort of hoping that de Armas’s ballerina Eve Macarro would put the smackdown on a couple of dozen goons while up on pointe. Sadly no. But I do have to admit that de Armas carries off the essential silliness of Ballerina and, after her performance as Paloma in No Time to Die opposite Daniel Craig’s 007, she proves again she can do action, in both couture and daytime wear; she can also carry out the time-honoured lightning-fast choreography of removing a clip from an automatic weapon, inspecting its contents, smacking it back into position with the heel of her palm and then filling someone full of lead.', 'Eve is inducted into the way of violence as a little kid, like Natalie Portman’s badass moppet in Luc Besson’s Léon, or indeed like John Wick himself; she is secretly trained in weaponry and martial arts at the same time as she is schooled in ballet, the rigour and discipline of which are considered to be complementary to those of beating the jeepers out of someone. It happened after her dad was whacked by a mysterious cult led by a dead-eyed creep called the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne), and the plucky orphan is taken in by the Ruska Roma group led by Anjelica Huston’s implacable Director, and grows to womanhood in this strange, dysfunctional ballet-plus-violence organisation whose income apparently derives from assassination fees. But Eve has always nursed a desire for revenge against the weird tribe who killed her dad.', 'Four John Wick films with Keanu fetishising his guns and sporting his increasingly werewolfy facial hair have been increasingly heavy going but now de Armas mixes things up and she is a smart screen presence. As for the ballet, the emphasis is on Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake; nothing wrong with that, of course, but if the Ballerina sub-franchise continues, let’s hope that different works are chosen and we see de Armas actually getting out there on stage in a tutu as opposed to simply racking up the kills.', 'Ballerina is out on 6 June in Australia and the US, and on 7 June in the UK.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5UWHBpZWs5a1lUWnZOMjR4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhVko1NW9HZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

"In fiery 'Ballerina,' Ana de Armas is more than 'a female John Wick'",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/05/john-wick-ballerina-movie-ana-de-armas/83922609007/,"['LAS VEGAS – Ana de Armas sobbed the first time she set a guy on fire.', 'Her assassin character in the “John Wick” franchise spinoff “Ballerina” (in theaters June 6) uses all manner of weaponry when dealing with various villains, including a flamethrower. Before filming a rather fiery sequence, de Armas had a harrowing moment rehearsing with a stuntman where she felt the reality of the fiction they were creating.', ""“He’s standing in front of me and I'm like, ‘OK, easy. Just going to do it,’ and, of course, he's performing,” de Armas recalls. “But I dropped the thing and started crying because he is burning. It was not a good image."", '“I had to unzip the (fireproof) onesie that they put on me and go for a walk. He came and showed me he was OK. But the first impression was really intense. I was not prepared for that. And then I burned like 106 people,” she adds with a proud smile.', 'After ""little tastes"" of action in “Ghosted” and “The Gray Man,” plus one memorable sequence in the James Bond movie “No Time to Die,” de Armas, 37, wanted more in her movie career. The Oscar-nominated actress got way more with “Ballerina.”', 'In the film, Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) is brought up as a dancer and killer in the criminal Ruska Roma organization after the tragic death of her father when she was a child. Eve is unleashed on the underworld, but when she discovers the cult that killed her dad, she goes rogue on a violent mission of vengeance that ultimately puts her at odds with Wick (Keanu Reeves) himself.', ""“This is a character with a very strong conviction, or you could say also she's very stubborn,” de Armas says of Eve. “Most of the movie’s about revenge, but then in the end, there's a beautiful twist about trying to change someone else's life.”"", ""Franchise regular Ian McShane sees the addition of de Armas to the “Wick” world as “a gift. She's lovely, she's talented and she can act. What more can you ask?” And Reeves loves watching her “be heroic” as Eve, like John, fights powers beyond her control. “It's cool to see Ana have that opportunity to have the John Wick challenge of 'Against all odds!’ and 'Another kind of revenge!’ ” he says."", ""However, it was extremely important to both de Armas and director Len Wiseman that Eve not be “a female John Wick.” The filmmaker wanted her to be dynamic but also deal with the fact that de Armas isn't going to look unstoppable going up against, say, a 6-foot-3 assassin."", ""“We wanted to play the reality. Unless she's thinking more clever about how that fight unfolds, she is going to get her ass kicked,” Wiseman says. “You see action movies where a female lead is just plowing through all these huge dudes, and me as an audience member just loving action, I go, ‘Really?’ So I was glad that Ana's like, ‘Oh, no. Yeah, I should get thrashed.’ ”"", ""That meant coming up with a signature style for Eve: In the Ruska Roma, she’s taught to “fight like a girl,” which means she needs to adapt, to improvise and to cheat. “We thought about that line a lot, and it's like, are people going to take it right?” de Armas says."", ""In creating the character's action choreography, de Armas leaned into her disadvantages. “I wanted every kick and every punch, and every time I get slammed against the wall or whatever's happening, it hurts,” the actress said. “She gets tired and she's overwhelmed and they keep coming at her. And the only thing that keeps her going is the motivation that she has.”"", 'But Eve is also extremely crafty and can make any object dangerous. She uses dinner plates, forks and candleholders in brawls, duct tapes a knife to a gun (so she can stab one bad guy while shooting another in the face) and, in the super-cool flamethrower faceoff, does damage with a firehose. (Which needed no extra practice, for the record. “That I did on the spot on the day,” de Armas reports.)', ""Wiseman came up with one of de Armas’ favorite off-the-wall weapons: an ice skate that Eve sticks her hand in and uses like a boxing glove on an enemy. “That could either be really lame and stupid or really cool and brutal,” the director says. The actress recalls the pitch: “I was like, ‘What did you just say?' ” she says with a laugh. “It was really crazy when he thought of it, but then it all made sense. It's painful to even watch it.”"", ' De Armas “never imagined” that her acting career was going to take this action-packed path, she says, and with “Ballerina,” she got what she asked for – and more. “After going through this, I was pretty satisfied.”']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5UWHBpZWs5a1lUWnZOMjR4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhVko1NW9HZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

Ballerina timeline explained – how does it connect to John Wick?,https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/john-wick-order-ballerina-timeline-explained/,"['Ana de Armas leads the latest entry in the hit action franchise.', 'New film Ballerina – or to use its rather long-winded full title, From the World of John Wick: Ballerina – is the fifth entry in the hit action franchise, arriving just over two years after John Wick: Chapter 4 ended in tragedy for the title character.', 'It is also the first instalment not to be led by Keanu Reeves as the deadly hitman, with the main role instead going to Ana de Armas – who plays Eve Macarro, a ballerina assassin training in the ways of the Ruska Roma.', 'But Reeves is not absent from the film entirely.

They discussed Wiseman’s directorial style, working with Bruce Willis on the fourth Die Hard film, and gave an answer to the rumored Ballerina reshoots by Chad Stahelski on this upcoming action film.', '“Taking place between the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and Chapter 4, Eve Macarro, a ballerina-assassin, begins to train in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma and sets out to exact revenge for her father’s death,” reads the synopsis.', 'Ballerina arrives in theaters on June 6, 2025.', 'Jonathan Sim: So I was reading the press notes for this movie, and Len, you said something very interesting where you said that Norman is so cool because he doesn’t think that he’s cool. So, Norman, I want to give you a chance to respond: what makes Len Wiseman cool?', 'Norman Reedus: Wow. I’ve worked with him before.', 'This is a Hawaii Five-O reunion, right?', 'Reedus: Yeah. I always knew he was cool. He’s easy to work with. He’s got great ideas, and he makes the set comfortable, which is cool. There’s a lot of things about Len that’s cool. You should see his pre-development for projects.', 'Len Wiseman: I call it mini-vis. We have pre-vis, we have fight vis, and I’ve created this. I used to do miniatures before I was doing props. So instead of doing storyboards, I do, I build these miniature action figures, shoot it, send to Norman for a good laugh.', 'Reedus: They’re crazy. They’re so good.', 'Len, I wanna say that you directed a movie previously that I think is very underrated, which is Live Free or Die Hard. I’m a huge, huge fan of that movie.', 'Wiseman: Thank you.', 'When you’re operating in these long-existing franchises, how do you bring your own directorial voice into a franchise that’s existed for a long time, especially when you’re directing actors like Bruce Willis as John McClane, or Keanu Reeves as John Wick?', 'Wiseman: It has to come from a very, very passionate place for me. So like, with Die Hard, I made a Die Hard movie in my backyard when I was 14. That was one of the most influential movies on me in terms of action. In fact, when Bruce Willis found out about that ’cause here I am, I think at that time, I mean, I was quite young. It was my first studio movie. I think I was 32. I don’t know. But anyways, he would call me “kid” a lot. Yeah. And he’d been through it many times. And when he found out that I did a Die Hard movie when I was 14 in my backyard, it just kind of connected with him. He’s like, “You did a Die Hard movie in your backyard, and now you’re directing a real one. You’re like, this is for real for you.” So long way to say, a passionate place to where you don’t really look too much at the pressure of it, the everything. I always take a look at being such a fan. If I was not directing this film, what would I want to see? And try to keep that present in my mind.', 'I gotta say, this might be my favorite movies of yours. I absolutely loved Ballerina. Iknow that there were some rumors that that there were Ballerina reshoots, but I wanted to ask, because I’ve seen the movie now, what portions of it were perhaps shot by Chad? Because to me, it truly felt like it was your vision the entire time.', 'Well, well, it is. We took a break, but when we did the first cut, the studio loved what they saw. There were scenes that we had to cut out of the script as budgetarily scheduled. Then when they saw the film and really loved it, embraced it, [they said] “How about we go and shoot those scenes that I know you were passionate about that you really love that we had to take out?” So it wasn’t reshoots, as it was additional shooting. Then Chad was always involved in terms of, I was trying to, at one point, wanted him to come in and do second unit, and I’ve known Chad for a long time. We’ve worked together quite a few times.', 'But in terms of the rumors and things that are out there, which are just, I guess, it turns into what it is. The personal thing for on the second leg of the shoot, I had a a health situation, I had to go into the hospital. So luckily Chad was there and we talked through in terms of some of the stuff that he’d be shooting until I got back and I’m back. I’m healthy and alive.', 'Thank you to Norman Reedus and Len Wiseman for discussing From the World of John Wick: Ballerina and its reshoots.', 'The post Ballerina’s Norman Reedus & Director Set Record Straight on Reshoot Rumors | Interview appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5UWHBpZWs5a1lUWnZOMjR4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhVko1NW9HZ28=-w280-h168-p-df

We’ll say no more.', '“Ballerina” knows we’re here for the nonstop action, and you don’t have to wait long until the next battle begins. ', 'Still, the film’s emotional beats almost all fall flat, and it’s not for lack of opportunities. Eve’s family tree should supply some human interest between the gun fights, but a key subplot fizzles.', 'Another possible connection disappoints when Eve meets a young girl in the Chancellor’s crosshairs.

The imperfect John Wick spin-off Ballerina didn’t need the Keanu cameo,https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/ballerina-john-wick-review-keanu-reeves-b2760911.html,"['', '', 'There’s such great action in this Ana de Armas vehicle, but it’s undercut by generic plotting and ‘female assassin’ stereotypes', ""From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'If it feels like you’ve already seen Ballerina – the new John Wick spin-off in which Ana de Armas plays a pirouetting assassin –you’re likely thinking of 2018’s Red Sparrow, in which Jennifer Lawrence stars as a Russian ballerina-turned-spy. It’s that, or maybe the flashbacks in Black Widow of the Marvel superhero’s childhood in the nefarious (and also Russian) Red Room, in which regular time at the barre formed part of the programme’s deadly curriculum.', 'It’d be nice if someone in Hollywood could try out a different metaphor for lethal feminine strength. But, for now, we’re here, where Armas’s Eve Macarro is raised by the same Ruska Roma (once again, Russian) clan that transformed Keanu Reeves’s Wick into the feared Baba Yaga, trained in the art of both murder and pliés. She’s seeking revenge against the man (Gabriel Byrne’s the Chancellor) responsible for her father’s (David Castañeda) death, all while trying to dodge a constant volley of “female assassin” stereotypes.', 'Her mentor, Nogi (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), at one point looks her dead in the eye and tells her to “fight like a girl” – a sentiment then echoed in the film’s closing credits, in a track by Evanescence and musician K Flay. It’s as if Nike’s suddenly rocked up with a van full of moisture-wicking polyester leggings to sell. When Eve crosses paths with Norman Reedus’s character and his adorable little daughter, the narrative develops an odd push-and-pull effect where it can’t decide whether her cold heart has been melted by awakening maternal urges, or whether she’s simply mystified that everyone’s assumed that for her.', 'It’s a little frustrating that Ballerina is even tempted by such bog-standard trademarks of the genre, since it’s all neatly countered by how rough, nasty, and deviously imaginative Eve is when she fights. She takes a kick and a punch as well as Wick does. She goes ham with a box full of grenades and a flamethrower.', 'There’s a moment in which a television set changes channel every time Eve punches someone. Briefly, we rest on the famous scene in Steamboat Bill, Jr, where the facade of a house falls down around Buster Keaton. It’s a nice homage to how much the Wick franchise is, in reality, a kind of violent, beautiful slapstick (and Ballerina has plenty of it, though nothing quite as poetic as Wick falling down all those Parisian stairs in Chapter 4).', 'Eve doesn’t “fight like a girl”; she fights like an actor one-upping her brief spin as a Bond girl and proving herself as a viable action star. Armas is fully aware that there’s probably something of her turn as Marilyn Monroe still knocking about in people’s heads – her trick isn’t to subvert it, but to keep it upfront and just push the anger up behind it. It works like a charm.', 'In practice, Ballerina is the fractured but occasionally genius result of a rocky production history. It started out as an original script by Shay Hatten that was retroactively adapted to fit into the Wick universe, with some uncredited contributions from Saltburn’s Emerald Fennell. And while officially directed by Len Wiseman, it underwent extensive reshoots reportedly steered by the main franchise’s director, Chad Stahelski.', 'It does, in its DNA, certainly feel like a part of the Wickiverse, even if Reeves’s inevitable cameo feels forced. And while it doesn’t add much depth to the world, it at least gives credence to the amusing suggestion that these films do, in fact, take place in an alternate dimension where every person on the planet is a professional assassin. If that’s the case, could the next spin-off at least expand the pool of women’s side gigs? Maybe an assassin dog walker?', 'Dir: Len Wiseman.

After sharing a meal together, Stahelski, who’s now helmed four chapters involving Keanu Reeves’ taciturn assassin, quickly endorsed Wiseman’s hiring to Lionsgate and producing partner, Thunder Road. ', 'The John Wick brain trust ultimately made the right call, as Wiseman’s actioner starring Ana de Armas now boasts his strongest reviews since Die Hard 4, including a rave from The Hollywood Reporter. He also received a kind word from one Tom Cruise after the star gushed about the film on a Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning red carpet. ', '', '“It was wonderful. He reached out to me as well, and he’s very kind. I love his energy of supporting other people’s work. I think we need more of that, quite honestly,” Wiseman tells THR in support of Ballerina‘s June 6 theatrical release.', 'In October 2024, THR spoke to Stahelski for the 10th anniversary of John Wick (2014) before he eventually addressed the online chatter surrounding Ballerina’s rumored creative overhaul. The franchise shepherd was well aware and visibly annoyed by the Internet’s claims that he conducted several months of “reshoots,” ultimately rejecting such notions by detailing the two weeks’ worth of additional photography he oversaw with Wiseman. He noted that Wiseman’s film did not have anywhere near the time or money of the recent John Wick films, and that he ran out of runway (and proper weather) to capture the entirety of Shay Hatten’s script. (Hatten wrote the original Ballerina script on spec before it was purchased by Lionsgate and retrofitted for the Wick world.)', '', 'Wiseman is now raising the same points about resources, something the studio was willing to furnish upon seeing an early version of Ballerina and knowing that they were on the right track. Understandably, the online narrative bothered the director as well. ', '“[Chad and I] were both frustrated about it. It’s a really frustrating thing [to hear such claims], and it happens more today than it did back in the day. There was additional shooting because the studio loved the movie,” Wiseman clarifies. “We had to take out some scenes from the script originally because we just didn’t have the resources or the schedule. So it was an exciting opportunity to go back and add more to the film. But when the press hears about that and the reports become whatever they are, it always has a negative connotation.”', 'One particular sequence that was scripted but never filmed during principal photography due to budget limitations is the extended opening in which young Eve Macarro (Victoria Comte) has to bear witness to her father’s death at the hands of the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne) and his cult that serves as the collective villain of the story. Essentially, Eve needed her visible source of vengeance à la John Wick’s murder of John’s cherished puppy, Daisy, which was a posthumous gift from his late wife.', '“It was in the script, but we just didn’t have the time and the schedule and everything needed to do that,” Wiseman says. “So that was one of the scenes that we went back to do, and I was absolutely thrilled that the studio was so supportive of us going back to get what we wanted.”', '', 'The newly orphaned Eve is then mysteriously recruited by franchise mainstay Winston Scott (Ian McShane), the owner of New York City’s assassin hotel, The Continental. He introduces Eve to Anjelica Huston’s the Director, who reprises her role from John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. Fueled by pain, Eve decides to join the Director’s crime syndicate, Ruska Roma, that doubles as a New York City ballet company. John Wick himself was also raised by the Director, and after a 12-year time jump, grown-up Eve encounters the man they call the “Baba Yaga” during his desperate return home in Chapter 3. ', 'Wiseman went to great lengths to not only extend existing Chapter 3 moments, but also create new scenes from Eve’s point of view during that timeline. With the movie taking place in between the third and fourth chapters of the series, Eve’s revenge tale once considered even more potential story beats that would run parallel to Chapter 3. ', '”As a fan, there were potential moments that I was really excited to work into the movie. In the scene where Eve first arrives at the Continental, you’d see a bunch of motorcycles speeding in the background of the city on the bridge,” Wiseman recalls. “That would’ve been cool for anyone who’s really paying attention to detail. ‘There’s the samurai and John on motorcycles [from Chapter 3].’”', 'Ballerina also once ended with Eve checking into the Continental, and Wiseman’s one-time wish was to then conclude the film on another angle from Chapter 3.', '', '“Right after Eve checks into the Continental, she’d go up to her room, and we’d see a view of the hotel to where we think the movie is ending,” Wiseman shares. “Then we’d hear a screech, and the camera pans down just in time to catch two motorcycles [John and Mark Dacascos’ Zero] crashing at the base of the Continental.”', 'Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Wiseman also discusses the other franchise characters that were briefly considered for returns, before explaining why his design of the grenade snowball fight is especially meaningful to him.', '***', 'Tom Cruise paid Ballerina quite a compliment. That must’ve been a welcome message to receive during your press tour. ', 'It was wonderful, yeah. He reached out to me as well, and he’s very kind. I love his energy of supporting other people’s work. “Let’s go back to the movies!” I think we need more of that, quite honestly.', 'My positive, and equally impactful, reaction to the film came out amid this commotion over the embargo language, and so I went back and checked what I was originally sent. And the messaging that I received didn’t have the wording that raised eyebrows. It was standard “spoiler-free social reaction” language. Anyway, were you pretty frustrated by that miscommunication? ', 'Yeah, of course. I’ve been so busy with the premieres that I don’t really even know much about it. I know [the miscommunication] was on [publicity’s] part. The other thing I knew is that they’re really not wanting to give away spoilers of any kind. There’s quite a few mysteries and such, but I can’t even really speak to it because I don’t actually know.', '', 'The road to Ballerina began with Live Free or Die Hard. John Wick co-creator Chad Stahelski worked for you on that set?', 'Yeah, Chad got killed [as an uncredited FBI agent and credited stuntman]. He pops up in there with a friend of mine [Brad Martin] that I grew up with; Brad was also working with that team as stunt coordinator. We shot that Baltimore sequence, and it was supposed to be the first action scene when Timothy Olyphant’s character does an onslaught on McLane [Bruce Willis] and Farrell [Justin Long]. Chad and Brad are the two FBI guys that have a firefight with the helicopter gunman. So Chad’s got a glorious death scene, and we’ve known each other for quite a long time just by coming up in the business together.', 'You’ve made action films in the 2000s, 2010s and the 2020s, so you’ve seen trends come and go. Now that you’ve worked inside it, do you fully understand why the Wickian brand of action has set the bar the last 11 years?', 'When you really can see that it’s your actor doing the action, there’s truly a different kind of feeling. A lot of people talk about the longer takes, and then there are longer takes that add stitches to make them even longer. Personally, that feels more like the director showing off his long take, as opposed to the longer takes in Wick that I’m a fan of. You don’t give the audience a second to take a breath, and it becomes more of an investment, especially if it’s actor-driven action. [Writer’s Note: In two of our previous chats, Stahelski has also railed against stitched oners.]', '', 'So there’s many reasons why I think John Wick set the bar in terms of choreography, but its very specific tone of action is really important too. You never want to laugh in the face of the character action that’s happening because then the stakes are gone. It could be a really fun sequence and tone, but if the action doesn’t have stakes and danger to it — and the characters are cracking jokes within the danger — as an audience member, you go, “If you’re not going to be afraid, then I’m not going to be afraid for you.” ', 'So there’s many levels, but if I had to really boil it down, it’s actor-based action that’s really had an impact. That’s what Keanu and Chad together brought to it. There’s something about staying in the shot with the actor. There’s a difference between watching a cool action scene and watching a cool action scene and going, “Holy shit, that’s him,” or, “That’s her.” It gives you a different kind of reaction.', 'Did No Time to Die essentially serve as Ana de Armas’ audition for Eve Macarro?', 'No, not at all, but that sequence was absolutely fantastic. I would love to see that character show up again; it was just too brief. We had already gotten involved with Ana. I had Ana in mind for quite a while before that. I went and saw a private screening of No Time to Die, and that confirmed her casting even more. So I was excited when I saw that cool moment, but she was already involved in the whole process.', 'Ballerina takes place between the third and fourth John Wick films. You revisit the events of John Wick: Chapter 3, using a Rashomon-type approach to show Eve’s point of view on John’s return to Ruska Roma. How challenging was it to expand Chapter 3 and maintain continuity?', '', 'It was definitely a challenge and an excitement. I love a challenge. It gives me fuel to be creative. So I had a really fun time taking a different perspective on certain elements of Chapter 3, and I was really into it. Early on, the moment that I thought would resonate and people would remember is when John comes to meet the Director [Anjelica Huston]. We’re now looking at it from Eve’s point of view before he mentions, “It wasn’t just a puppy.” It took a lot of time to recreate the sets exactly. I wanted to really recreate those moments from a different perspective so that we weren’t just using footage from the existing film. ', 'I watched the scene again for the timing and spacing, and there’s a little detail when John and the Director walk down the stairs. John looked [to his left] in that moment where they stop on the stairs, and so there was space to add a piece where he looks up slightly and sees Eve. And so we got to see that moment from her side. I love that stuff. I’ve done sequels and remakes, and Ballerina just doesn’t feel that way. In fact, I actually think the word spinoff is misleading for this.', 'John meets Eve before she goes on to complete her first contract, and then you jump ahead two months. Does that mean John returns to the movie after Winston (Ian McShane) shot him off the roof at the end of John Wick: Chapter 3?', 'Yes.', 'So it’s after he’s recovered a little bit? I just want to get the timeline right.', 'Yes.', 'Did Keanu’s days on set have the same electricity that his mythical boogeyman character has in the story? ', '', 'He really does have that effect. It’s such a contradiction too because he’s one of the nicest, most generous — forget actors — humans that we have. So there is a reverence when he walks on set in the suit. He is John Wick, even when he’s just walking around on set. It’s similar to when Harrison Ford puts on the hat and carries the whip. It’s pretty awesome, and it gives you chills.', 'Did Keanu have you trim his dialogue at all? He tends to have a “less is more” mindset with Wick.', 'He did! He’s very collaborative. I had a really great experience getting into his head about the character. We got together at the hotel before shooting, and we essentially did that. He absolutely is the guy who is like, “I don’t need to say that. What if I don’t say this, and I just do it with a look?” So, yeah, there was a culling of dialogue.', 'Daniel Bernhardt plays a “Scarred Eye Assassin,” and I bring this up because he played a notable character who John Wick killed in the first movie. Is the scar meant to imply that his original character survived? Or is the scar supposed to signal that he’s an entirely new character? [Note: Bernhardt also did stunt work on the second and third Wick films. Fans spotted someone in Chapter 4 that resembles him, but it’s still uncredited and unconfirmed.]', 'We had a lot of talks about how much we should cover Bernhardt’s face. It’s an ambiguous, fun gag as to what people make of him. But in the scope of my story, I’m treating him as a different character. At the same time, I wanted people to recognize him.', '', 'Rooney (Unity Phelan) was the first ballerina we met at Ruska Roma in Chapter 3. Was there ever a discussion about bringing her back? Or would that have been too confusing in the middle of Eve’s own introduction? [Note: Rooney is the name of the main character in Shay Hatten’s original Ballerina script, before it was retrofitted for the Wick franchise.]', 'There absolutely was very early on, but you’re exactly right. I thought it would cause confusion. She’s the one highlighted ballerina character that we see in Chapter 3, and it just would have caused a hiccup of clarity.', 'It was bittersweet to see Lance Reddick’s Charon one final time. Knowing that this was the last of Lance’s footage, did you repurpose or recontextualize anything just so you could use it all?', 'Honestly, no. Everything that we did is very important to the film. Everything that we shot is in there, and it’s in there for the story and the movie. I’m so happy that I got the chance to actually work with him and have him in this film. Lance would say this, but there aren’t really any good guys in the Wick universe. It’s a universe of all bad guys in a sense, but I do believe that Lance’s character, Charon, is the heart and soul of the series.', 'I love that you perpetuated the running gag involving the Continental. Every movie introduces a new room or wing that we didn’t know was there previously, and the dimensions never align with the exterior of the building. ', '', '(Laughs.) I remember talking to Chad about it. He showed me the production designer’s side view of all the Continental’s levels and what could be underground. But they decided to just keep it as a running gag, like you said. If you look at that building, it’s the tallest, skinniest structure. This is a weird reference, but it’s like The Man with Two Brains. Steve Martin walks into that small condo door only to see a castle interior, and he’s like, “From the outside, it does not look this roomy.” (Laughs.) So it’s almost like you enter a door, and you cross over into this slightly heightened world with all these rooms. So I think it’ll continue to grow now that it’s been destroyed. You’ll find more of the underground sections of it.', 'I spoke to Chad for the 10th anniversary of John Wick, and we eventually discussed Ballerina’s additional photography. He quickly expressed a bit of frustration that the “couple of weeks” of extra shooting that you guys did was so blown out of proportion. Ultimately, are you just glad that the studio backed the movie to such a degree that you could add more firepower to it? ', 'A hundred percent. We were both frustrated about it. It’s a really frustrating thing [to hear such claims], and it happens more today than it did back in the day. There was additional shooting because the studio loved the movie. We had to take out some scenes from the script originally because we just didn’t have the resources or the schedule. [Lionsgate] then really believed in the [early cut of the] movie after we put it together, so it was an exciting opportunity to go back and add more to the film. But when the press hears about that and the reports become whatever they are, it always has a negative connotation. But I’m just so glad that we were able to go back. ', '', 'For instance, it was really important to me that we showed Ana’s character as a little girl, and we didn’t have that opening before [additional photography]. It was in the script, but we just didn’t have the time and the schedule and everything needed to do that. So that was one of the scenes that we went back to do, and I was absolutely thrilled that the studio was so supportive of us going back to get what we wanted. [Note: Wiseman has noted elsewhere that Reeves was not involved in additional photography.]', 'To name a few, the grenade fight, the car crash in the alleyway and the flamethrower sequences are so impressive. ', 'Thank you.', 'What are your individual highlights from each?', 'I love all their different stories. The grenade sequence means a lot because it was the first action sequence that I wrote up a while ago. (Laughs.) When we were developing the script from stage one, I asked, “What if there was a snowball fight with grenades? What would that be like?” The process of shooting it was a fun one to design. There were a lot of trap doors for our stunt players to go through before the pyrotechnics went off, and that allowed us to stay in the one shot with Ana. So it was just something that I had not seen before. ', 'There’s only so many weapons available to create an action sequence, and having an actual gunfight with flamethrowers has never been seen on-screen. If you’re pitching an action sequence to a studio and you want to put together a rip reel or an example for them to watch, it’s a good thing when you can’t find examples or references. That’s when you know you’re onto something unique.', '', 'I know there’s some VFX involved, but I just don’t understand how you can execute the flamethrower fight without burning the set down and inflicting third-degree burns on the entire cast and crew.', 'We worked with the best stunt team around in 87eleven, so it was a really safe set. And there were very limited visual effects. It’s essentially a practical sequence despite some enhancements. So it was controlled, but it absolutely was dangerous, especially being inside with both of those flamethrowers going off at the same time. ', 'I’ve done action sequences with helicopters, and helicopters at close range are terrifying on set. They sound terrifying. If you get on a helicopter, it feels dangerous, especially when it’s doing stunts that are coming in low to your cameras and everything. The flamethrowers have that same effect, and I’ve never utilized a weapon that had that much of a dangerous vibe about it. But it’s unlike anything that I’ve seen, and that’s the goal of every sequence.', '[Note: The following section contains very mild spoilers, primarily who did not appear and what did not happen in Ballerina.]', 'The movie ends with the audience wanting to know what’s next for Eve. Do you know what’s next for her? ', 'In fantasy-type thinking, yes, but I really just concentrated on this film. I wanted this film to be the best that it could possibly be, but it’s hard not to wonder. Often, when I am asked that, I’ll say, “No, I want to wait and see what happens.” And that’s true to a point, but when you’re developing something and you get so immersed in a character, you have to build out what their story is before and after the movie you’re making. That’s how you really understand the character, so that’s always on my mind. ', '', 'The movie ends a bit ambiguously on purpose. Who’s putting the contract out on her? I’d like to hear theories about where it goes. I definitely have my theory. I would love it if it were to continue, and I think it would surprise people where we would go with it. So we’re just waiting for what the reaction is to this one, but yes, I totally have fantasy plans about where Eve would go.', 'So no one ever said, “Hey, tee this ending up for John Wick 5 to pick up where you left off”?', 'No, not at all.', 'There’s a cool scene at a table where Eve has to assemble and fire a weapon before someone else does. Was there ever a draft that had her on the other side of that table? ', 'Oh, interesting. No. ', 'That’s where I thought the movie was heading. She’d be forced to come back to Ruska Roma and sit on the other side.', 'When the other character says to Eve, “I’m you in ten fucking years,” let’s see what happens in ten fucking years. (Laughs.) Eve is still going on her path, and it’s a brutal world. We see a darker side to the Director’s character in this one, and the rules are in place for a good reason. They abide by their code and their rules, and even if you’re a surrogate mother role like the Director, you have to protect your tribe. I remember talking to Anjelica about putting a darker slant on her character, and her eyes lit up.', 'Did you consider any other franchise cameos? ', 'Laurence Fishburne’s Bowery King was discussed early on as we were fine tuning the timeline, and then there was a discussion about Caine [Donnie Yen] at one point. It’s really finding what fits the story best. Ruska Roma was our base, so it allowed us different windows of crossing over into the parallel timeline.', '', 'But there weren’t just characters considered. As a fan, there were potential moments that I was really excited to work into the movie. In the scene where Eve first arrives at the Continental, you’d see a bunch of motorcycles speeding in the background of the city on the bridge. You always have to make the timeline work, but that would’ve been cool for anyone who’s really paying attention to detail. “There’s the samurai and John on motorcycles [from Chapter 3].”', 'That would’ve been cool.', 'Yeah, at one point, before the timeline became exactly what it is, there was another idea that I liked at the end. Right after Eve talks to Winston and checks into the Continental, she’d go up to her room, and we’d see a view of the hotel to where we think the movie is ending. Then we’d hear a screech, and the camera pans down just in time to catch two motorcycles [John and Mark Dacascos’ Zero] crashing at the base of the Continental. Fucking cool, right?', 'You should add those details to your special edition of Ballerina in ten years.', 'I know! I love stuff like that. Some people might go, “What’s going on?” But for the people who are in on it, they’d be like, “That’s just cool.”\n\n***\nBallerina is now playing in movie theaters nationwide.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Get the scoops first!

Ballerina’s Second Half Does John Wick Proud,https://www.vulture.com/article/ballerinas-john-wick-ana-de-armas.html,"['', '', '', 'Ballerina is a movie about Eve Macarro, an assassin played by Ana de Armas who embarks on a bloody quest for revenge. It is also a movie about what makes the John Wick series work, though I have a feeling that was not part of the original pitch. A spinoff that takes place, somewhat confusingly, against the backdrop of the third Wick installment, , pivots out from the sequence in the 2019 movie in which John (Keanu Reeves), on the run from the underworld he’s been unable to escape from, pays a visit to his old stomping grounds with the Ruska Roma, the Romani crime family of which he was once a member. He demands safe passage from its steely Director (Anjelica Huston), and she takes him back through halls filled with tattooed dancers and grappling wrestlers in training — pupils who, the Director intones, had to be disabused of their wish for “a life free of suffering.” This, it’s implied, is where John first learned to be John, and it’s where Eve is turned into a professional killer after her father is murdered in front of her. The first half of Ballerina, which is a real drag, takes us through this origin story while insisting that the essence of the franchise, in addition to nightclub fights and bisexual lighting, is lots of talk about the baroque rules that delineate its underworld of warring criminal clans.', 'Then the second half makes the case that actually, all that stuff is just set dressing, and the Wicks live and die on the very particular mix of verve and humor that has made their action sequences so distinctive. It’s so much better than the first half that it might as well be a whole different movie. Maybe it is. While innocuous hack Len Wiseman is the credited director, reports of major reshoots prompted producer Chad Stahelski, the director of the original John Wick films, to downplay how much he took over in an interview that actually had the opposite effect. Whatever the behind-the-scenes facts, the reality onscreen is that, an hour into this 125-minute picture, there’s a set piece involving grenades in which the takes get longer, the choreography more creative, and the basic framing of the action more thoughtful, and from that point on, the movie blossoms in a flourish of arterial spray. This bifurcation makes Ballerina a wildly uneven viewing experience, but that second hour is so thrilling that the first doesn’t really matter.', 'Or, rather, it matters only as yet another cautionary tale about overstretched IP. There’s a Ship of Theseus dilemma built into franchises: At which point after replacing the lead, the director, the writer, and the narrative does the thing you’re making still count as the thing everyone originally loved? The first John Wick, which came out over a decade ago now, owed its excellence to the alchemy of its elements — to the ruefulness of Reeves (who was starring in plenty of unmemorable shit at the time), the stunt backgrounds that Stahelski and his collaborator David Leitch brought to the filmmaking, and the film’s understanding that its elaborate mythology shouldn’t be taken too seriously. Watching Ballerina trudge through its blown-out opening act, there’s plenty of time to think about how generic the component parts — revenge, assassins, codes, criminal clans — are on their own. The more we learn about the day-to-day of the Ruska Roma, who train up the girls to be “kikimora,” supposed protector figures for hire whose work in practice doesn’t seem all that different from killing for hire, the less interesting the organization and its existence in this larger world becomes.', 'Eve herself is not that interesting — pursuing professional death-dealing simply to prove she can and opting not to ask questions about what she can look forward to in terms of a future. De Armas, who lit up her small action-heavy part in the 2021 Bond film No Time to Die, acquits herself well in the fight scenes while being unable to transcend the limitations of Eve as just another broken-doll type. There wasn’t all that much to John in his first movie, either, but Reeves found something wry in his character’s reluctant un-retirement from life in the suburbs and return to being a notorious badass, while de Armas just defaults toward the dour. It’s only when the movie gets funny around her that Eve is able to build some momentum, after she restarts her quest to track down the group who killed her father and finds her way to an idyllic small town in Austria where the residents turn out to all be assassins. There, beside an iced-over lake, around and through stone buildings climbing a hill, Ballerina ditches the overexplaining and the brooding and gives way to a joyous orgy of wintry violence (and a small but key appearance from Reeves).', 'I didn’t think the sight of de Armas whipping around a pair of ice skates by the laces like nunchucks could be topped, but then she and a henchman engage in a duel using flamethrowers, exchanging and ducking around gouts of fire as they make their way down a snowy street. It’s absurd, and thrilling, and gorgeous, and I don’t know what got us there, but while Ballerina doesn’t start off as a real John Wick movie, it sure ends as one.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU5UWHBpZWs5a1lUWnZOMjR4VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhVko1NW9HZ28=-w280-h168-p-df
