As a result, a number of Ozempic NAION lawsuits have since been filed as a result by patients who say they suffered vision loss due to the drugs’ side effects.', 'Lawyers are pursuing Ozempic lawsuits, Wegovy lawsuits and Mounjaro lawsuits over gastroparesis or stomach paralysis, which can leave users with long-term gastrointestinal side effects', '', 'In January 2025, another study was published in medRxiv, which led the Danish Medicines Agency to officially request an investigation into Ozempic NAION risks by the European Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee.', 'PRAC’s press release indicates that the agency has analyzed data on semaglutide NAION cases from studies, clinical trials and post-market surveillance, determining that it is a rare side effect of the drug that may affect up to one in 10,000 users.', '“Results from several large epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to semaglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes is associated with an approximately two-fold increase in the risk of developing NAION compared with people not taking the medicine,” the press release states. “EMA has therefore recommended that the product information for semaglutide medicines is updated to include NAION as a side effect with a frequency of ‘very rare’. If patients experience a sudden loss of vision or rapidly worsening eyesight during treatment with semaglutide, they should contact their doctor without delay.”', 'The European regulators also noted that if doctors confirm a NAION diagnosis, use of Ozempic, Wegovy or Rybelsus should be halted immediately.', 'The process now requires that the PRAC send its recommendations and assessment to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which will likely adopt PRAC’s opinion.

The conclusion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) affirms two studies that suggested the link back in December 2024.', 'The EMA’s safety committee said that non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is indeed a rare safety risk of semaglutide, which is marketed as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for diabetes. The committee said the side effect occurs in up to one in 10,000 people who take semaglutide.', 'Given the evidence, based on non-clinical studies, clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance and medical literature, the committee has recommended that semaglutide’s labels be updated to include the “very rare” risk, according to the Friday announcement.', 'Breaking down the risk further, the EMA committee explained that the studies it reviewed showed that adults with type 2 diabetes who took the drugs had an approximately twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION, with an estimated two cases of the condition per 10,000 patient years of treatment. A patient year corresponds to one person taking semaglutide for one full year.', '“If patients experience a sudden loss of vision or rapidly worsening eyesight during treatment with semaglutide, they should contact their doctor without delay,” the EMA committee said. “If NAION is confirmed, treatment with semaglutide should be stopped.”', 'In December 2024, the Danish Medicines Agency announced a plan to review the new eye safety risk that had been seen in several patients taking Ozempic. Two studies conducted in the country suggested that patients who receive the GLP-1 medicine have an increased risk of developing NAION.

Ozempic and blindness: Is vision loss a side effect of this weight loss drug?,https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/link-between-ozempic-and-blindness/,"['There is a lot of curiosity around Semaglutide, which is sold under different brands, including Ozempic. It may help to control blood sugar levels and support weight loss. But the medicine, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for type 2 diabetes management, may also cause nausea and diarrhea. These common side effects may disappear once your body gets used to the weekly jabs. However, there are also studies that have linked this medicine to vision loss. Is there any connection between Ozempic and blindness? Let’s find out.', 'Ozempic (semaglutide) is an injectable medication classified as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. “GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that plays a major role in glucose regulation, especially after eating,” says endocrinologist Dr Dheeraj Kapoor. Administered once weekly via subcutaneous injection, the medicine is primarily used along with a healthy diet and exercise to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. It is also used for weight loss.', 'Here are some of the benefits of Ozempic:', 'Ozempic and blindness don’t have a direct link. However, there are a few potential indirect links:', 'For people with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina, rapid improvements in blood sugar control, such as those seen with medications like Ozempic, can sometimes be associated with a temporary worsening of retinopathy. “This is a known phenomenon in diabetes management, not exclusive to Ozempic. This temporary worsening could potentially impact vision if not monitored,” says Dr Kapoor. In a two-year trial involving people with diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more cases of diabetic retinopathy complications were seen in participants treated with Ozempic (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%), as per the US Food and Drug Administration.', 'There are studies that have suggested a possible association between Ozempic and blindness. A link between semaglutide and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) was found during a 2024 study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. “It is a condition involving sudden vision loss due to a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve,” says Dr Kapoor. A new review, published in JAMA Ophthalmology in January 2025, showed that nine people taking semaglutide and tirzepatide either experienced NAION, papillitis or paracentral acute middle maculopathy. These conditions lead to vision loss.', 'If vision changes were related to a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy due to rapid glycemic improvement, vision might stabilise. “It may improve over time, regardless of whether Ozempic is continued, as the overall glucose control improves,” says the expert. If the vision changes were linked to other factors, such as NAION, the outcome would depend on the nature and extent of the optic nerve damage. “In NAION or other eye conditions, vision loss is often permanent, although some people may experience partial recovery,” says the expert. So, the reversibility of vision changes after stopping Ozempic depends entirely on the underlying cause of the vision issue.', 'The link between Ozempic and blindness may not be obvious, but there are side effects that you can expect. The side effects of Ozempic primarily involve the gastrointestinal system:', 'Less common, but potentially more serious side effects of Ozempic can include:', 'Preventing potential eye issues and other side effects while on Ozempic involves:', 'It is important to note that Ozempic and blindness are not usually connected, and vision loss is not a commonly reported or an expected side effect of this weight loss drug.

The medication also introduces pancreatic cells to secrete insulin in response to increased glucose content. GLP-1 RAs are one of the most widely used treatments in the world for diabetes and obesity.2', 'However, GLP-1 RAs have also exhibited adverse events. In two major phase 3a trials, GLP-1 RAs were associated with a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and a .8% higher proportion of DR cases compared to placebo. Additionally, recent studies have posited that rapidly lowering blood glucose because of GLP-1 RAs may lead to a hypoxic state in the retina, promoting further abnormal angiogenesis.1', '“Given that the underlying pathogenesis of nAMD involves abnormal and excessive angiogenesis, we aimed to evaluate this hypothesis by investigating an association between systemic exposure to GLP-1 RAs and the incidence of nAMD using data from a population-based study,” Reut Shor, MD, department of ophthalmology and vision sciences, University of Toronto, and colleagues wrote.1', 'Shor and colleagues collected data on adult patients ≥66 years with diabetes from 2020-2023. Patients who were followed up for <12 months or were diagnosed with nAMD before or at the time of diabetes diagnosis were excluded. A total of 1,069,140 patients with diabetes were collected – of these, 72,755 (6.8%) had been exposed to GLP-1 RAs for ≥6 months. 996,385 patients (93.2%) had no prior exposure.1', 'Of the individuals exposed to GLP-1 RAs, 93 patients (.2%) were newly diagnosed with nAMD by the end of the study. By comparison, 88 patients with no prior GLP-1 RA experience were newly diagnosed with nAMD. Univariable Cox proportional analysis indicates that patients with diabetes exposed to GLP-1 RAs had a substantially higher incidence of diagnosis than those who were not (.2% versus .1%; difference, .1%; 95% CI, .08%-.12%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.58-2.82).1', 'In addition to GLP-1 RAs, the study also indicated that increased age and a history of cerebrovascular accident were associated with a significantly increased risk of nAMD (age: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18; cerebrovascular accident: HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.15-3.34).1', 'Shor and colleagues noted that these results are consistent with the growing body of literature questioning the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, the use of which has been dramatically increasing in recent years. However, they do indicate a few limitations, including a lack of stratification by GLP-1 RA prescription type, inability to account for dose, route of administration, or frequency of administration of GLP-1 RAs, and an inability to account for other variables like smoking and sun exposure.1', 'In a related editorial, Brian VanderBeek, MD, MPH, department of ophthalmology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, supports the research, stating that these findings are critical to contextualize the potential risks of mis- or overusing GLP-1 RAs.3', '“GLP-1 RAs have had a tremendous role in the care of patients with diabetes and now those needing additional help with weight management,” VanderBeck wrote. “However, the adage that ‘there is no such thing as a free lunch’ remains true.

Signs and symptoms of nAMD include blurred vision, difficulty seeing at a distance or doing detailed work, blind spots developing in the line of sight, difficulty distinguishing between colors and edges, and straight lines appearing wavy.

This observation has led to the hypothesis that the rapid reduction in blood glucose levels caused by GLP-1s might create a hypoxic state in the retina, potentially fostering abnormal blood vessel growth. Given that the development of nAMD involves similar abnormal blood vessel proliferation, the researchers conducted a population-based study that investigated the potential link between systemic GLP-1 exposure and the incidence of nAMD.1', 'This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2020 to November 2023 with a 3-year follow-up, including investigated data from Ontario, Canada, which was provided by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.

They help reduce blood sugar levels, slow digestion and reduce appetite.', 'But a study by Canadian scientists published in Jama Ophthalmology has found that after six months of use GLP-1 RAs are associated with double the risk of older people with diabetes developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared with similar patients not taking the drugs.', 'Academics at the University of Toronto examined medical data for more than 1 million Ontario residents with a diagnosis of diabetes and identified 46,334 patients with an average age of 66 who were prescribed GLP-1 RAs. Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.', 'The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.', 'Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.', 'The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.', 'Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.', 'Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.', '“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”', 'In an accompanying editorial, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.', '“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.', 'VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”', 'A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.', '“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”', 'Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary. On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.”']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZVM1U0UWxGMGRIaG5ibEpUVFJEZ0F4aUFCU2dLTWdZVlE0eHBKUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Why there is a higher risk remains unknown, however.', 'While a rapid systemic reduction in glucose, including in the retina, may induce a temporary hypoxic state after use of GLP-1 agonists, the study authors reasoned that a prolonged increase in risk is more likely related to a mechanism of increased chemokine CXCL12 levels triggering vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.', '""The adage that \'there is no such thing as a free lunch\' remains true. While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur,"" according to Brian VanderBeek, MD, MPH, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.', 'In an adjoining editorial\nopens in a new tab or window\n, he cited the early clinical trials that tied GLP-1 receptor agonists to diabetic retinal disease.', '""This seemed counterintuitive, since nearly all other diabetic endpoints improved with these medications. Researchers then theorized that these results were not specific to GLP-1 RA [receptor agonist] use, but rather an effect of a disproportionate number of patients experiencing [diabetic retinal disease] paradoxical worsening after rapid blood glucose control -- an effect that was not expected to occur in the placebo group,"" VanderBeek wrote.', '""Additional ocular concerns have been raised with recent reports of an increased occurrence of nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy\nopens in a new tab or window\n(NAION) associated with GLP-1 RA use,\nopens in a new tab or window\n"" he added. ""Again, the pathophysiologic mechanism is not clear, but it may be related to lower optic nerve head perfusion due to autonomic vascular dynamics and overall lower systemic blood pressure induced by GLP-1 RA use.""', 'The editorialist stressed the need to assess whether other GLP-1 drugs can show a more favorable benefit-risk profile\nopens in a new tab or window\n, while the researchers cautioned the findings should not be generalized to specific brands -- in the study, semaglutide users accounted for 97.5% of the GLP-1 agonist use, the small remainder having used the discontinued lixisenatide (Adlyxin).', ""For their study, Shor and colleagues relied on data from Ontario's health system for 2020 to 2023. Individuals with diabetes ages 66 and older exposed to GLP-1 receptor agonists for 6 months or more were matched 1:2 to unexposed peers, resulting in a study cohort of 139,002 patients."", 'Altogether, the mean age was 66 years across the two groups, and 47% were women. The average duration of diabetes was just over 6 years, and 64% had hypertension.', 'According to the results, risk for nAMD was higher in those who had used the GLP-1 drugs for more than 30 months (adjusted HR 3.62, 95% CI 2.56-5.13) or 18 to 30 months (adjusted HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.49-3.45) versus those who had used them for 6 to 18 months (adjusted HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53-1.65).', '""Although not impossible, it seems unlikely that a person would progress from no AMD [age-related macular degeneration] to nAMD within 3 years. This would suggest there was an already at-risk group of patients with non-neovascular AMD within the cohort,"" commented VanderBeek.', '""Future work should focus on controlling for the baseline level of AMD to determine if it is, in fact, this subgroup driving the results seen,"" he urged. ""Next, work needs to be done to determine if this is an adverse effect only in patients with diabetes or if those using GLP-1 RAs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk.""', ""Shor's group acknowledged that the present study could not stratify risk by the different GLP-1 drugs and it did not account for factors such as dose, route of administration, and frequency of administration."", 'Randy Dotinga is a freelance medical and science journalist based in San Diego.', 'Disclosures', 'Shor reported research funding from the Silver Target Foundation.

The study also found that the longer subjects were treated with these medications, the greater their risk of developing wet AMD.', 'Neovascular age-related macular degeneration, commonly known as wet AMD, is the less common but more aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration, and a leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older adults in the United States.', 'The findings, published on June 5 in JAMA Ophthalmology\n, suggest that doctors and patients should be aware of the potential risks, even though the chance of developing the condition remains relatively low.', 'GLP-1 drugs, a class of blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs sold under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, have surged in popularity in recent years. They offer a range of substantial benefits, including weight loss, improved blood sugar levels, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk.', 'Despite these benefits, ophthalmologists say the impact of GLP-1 drugs on eye health is not well understood. Studies have identified an association between the medications and other eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).', 'While the findings don’t establish a clear causal link between GLP-1 drugs and eye disease, experts say there’s still reason for caution.', '“The dose-response effect we observed — where longer GLP-1 receptor agonist exposure was associated with higher risk — strengthens the argument that this association may reflect a true biological effect rather than being due to confounding factors,” said study co-author Andrew Mihalache, MD(C), of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Canada.', '“Seeing a graded relationship like this suggests that prolonged exposure could play a causal role in increasing risk. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies,” he told Healthline.', 'Drawing on health records from Ontario, Canada, researchers at the University of Toronto analyzed nearly 140,000 adults with type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible link between GLP-1 use and wet AMD. The retrospective study tracked patient outcomes over a three-year period, using data collected between 2020 and 2023.', 'Roughly one-third of participants — about 46,000 people — had been prescribed a GLP-1 drug for at least six months.

A retrospective 2024 study evaluated nearly 700 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were taking a GLP-1 drug and found no association between GLP-1s and worsening retinopathy.', 'Also in 2024, researchers found that patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide were at greater risk of NAION compared to those who weren’t. NAION is a condition that causes sudden blindness, typically just in one eye, due to a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve.', 'The mechanism for why GLP-1 drug use may lead to wet AMD is not well established, but a predominant theory is that lowering blood sugar rapidly leads to a lack of oxygen in the retina.', '“When you make the retina more hypoxic, which is what the GLP-1s do, it basically pushes it further over the threshold, causing more abnormal blood vessels to grow,” said Linda Lam, MD, MBA, an ophthalmologist with Keck Medicine of USC, who wasn’t involved in the research.', 'Abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye is the hallmark of wet AMD.', 'While GLP-1s offer many health benefits, eye disease risk must be considered in some populations, Lam told Healthline.', '“In this particular group of patients who are older, who are diabetics, I really would caution against the extended use of GLP-1s,” she said.', 'Lam reiterated the importance of annual eye exams for the general population, but in particular for those with diabetes, to identify and diagnose eye disease early on.', 'People with type 2 diabetes, especially those taking a GLP-1 drug, should be aware of the signs and symptoms of vision loss and consult with their doctor immediately.

GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Exposure Linked to Neovascular AMD in Patients With Diabetes,https://www.endocrinologyadvisor.com/news/glp-1-receptor-agonist-exposure-linked-to-neovascular-amd-in-patients-with-diabetes/,"['HealthDay News — For patients with diabetes, exposure to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) is associated with an increased risk for incident neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) development, according to a study published online June 5 in JAMA Ophthalmology.', 'Reut Shor, M.D., from the University of Toronto in Canada, and colleagues examined the risk for developing nAMD associated with GLP-1 RA use in patients with diabetes in a population-based, retrospective cohort study. Patients aged 66 years or older with a diagnosis of diabetes and a minimum follow-up period of 12 months following initial diabetes diagnosis were included in the study. A matched cohort of 139,002 patients was created, with 46,334 patients exposed to GLP-1 RAs and 92,668 unexposed patients.', 'The researchers found that the exposed cohort had a higher incidence of nAMD than the unexposed cohort. Both unadjusted (crude) and adjusted models estimated hazard ratios for nAMD development of greater than 2.0 among patients exposed to GLP-1 RAs (crude hazard ratio, 2.11; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.21).', '“While these findings align with the existing literature favoring a hypoxic-dependent mechanism of nAMD, diabetic retinopathy, and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy exacerbation, further research is needed to determine if there is a true cause-and-effect relationship in the association identified in this investigation and to understand the tradeoffs between the benefits and risks of GLP-1 RAs,” the authors write.', '“We want to know what the effects of these drugs are because we know that there are receptors for GLP-1 in the retina, and so it’s reasonable to try to figure out what that might mean,” said Talia Kaden, M.D., from Northwell Health in New York City, who was not involved in the study. “When you take into account all of the benefits that we know people have when they’re on these medications, I don’t think that this slight increase that we may be seeing in this particular cohort … should be a reason for people to not be on these drugs.”', 'One author disclosed ties to Alcon, Apellis, AbbVie, Bayer, Bausch Health, and Roche.', 'Abstract/Full Text (subscription or payment may be required)', 'Editorial (subscription or payment may be required)', 'Sign up\nfor the latest news, education, & treatment resource information', 'Endocrinology Advisor, a trusted source of medical news and feature content for healthcare providers, offers clinicians insight into the latest research to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.', 'Copyright © 2025 Haymarket Media, Inc.

"GLP-1 Drug Can Cause Rare, Potentially Blinding Side Effect, EMA Warns",https://www.medpagetoday.com/ophthalmology/generalophthalmology/115938,"['by Kristen Monaco, Senior Staff Writer, MedPage Today\nJune 6, 2025 • 2 min read', 'A potentially blinding condition is a very rare side effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded\nopens in a new tab or window\n.', ""Following a review of all available data, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee determined that semaglutide increases the risk for non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)."", 'As a result, the agency recommended a product information update to include NAION as a ""very rare"" side effect. This means it could affect up to one in 10,000 people taking semaglutide.', '""If patients experience a sudden loss of vision or rapidly worsening eyesight during treatment with semaglutide, they should contact their doctor without delay. If NAION is confirmed, treatment with semaglutide should be stopped,"" the EMA urged.', 'The announcement comes on the heels of mounting evidence linking GLP-1 receptor agonists with eye conditions\nopens in a new tab or window\n, including age-related macular degeneration\nopens in a new tab or window\n.', 'One such study\nopens in a new tab or window\non NAION risk found that diabetes patients taking semaglutide had more than a fourfold higher risk for developing the condition compared with patients not on a GLP-1 agonist over 3 years. Those prescribed semaglutide for overweight or obesity had a more than sevenfold higher risk for NAION.', ""In EMA's announcement, the drug regulator cited several large epidemiological studies that suggested a roughly twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION for patients with type 2 diabetes taking semaglutide compared with the general public."", 'The FDA has not issued a warning about NAION in relation to any GLP-1 drugs, but is actively monitoring reports of adverse events. A recent study\nopens in a new tab or window\nusing data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System showed a disproportionately higher rate of NAION among semaglutide users versus users of other GLP-1 agonists.', 'Kristen Monaco is a senior staff writer, focusing on endocrinology, psychiatry, and nephrology news.
