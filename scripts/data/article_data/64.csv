"Danger! Not One, But Two Asteroids Could Hit Earth in the Next Century",https://www.yourweather.co.uk/news/astronomy/danger-not-one-but-two-asteroids-could-hit-earth-in-the-next-century.html,"['Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a less than 3% chance of colliding with Earth. But another, much larger asteroid could hit us head-on. This is the real probability.', 'There’s already 2024 YR4, an asteroid that astronomers are monitoring because it could collide with Earth in 2032. The asteroid was named in part because it was discovered in December 2024, it’s nearly 60 meters in diameter and, on its own, could devastate an entire city. Scientists estimated that there was a 3% chance of this happening within 7 years.', 'After carefully studying their models, as well as data from the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers ultimately reduced the risk percentage. 2024 YR4 will graze the Moon but won’t head directly toward Earth as initially predicted. Whew! Except... another asteroid, much larger, could impact us!', 'It was first identified and observed in 1999 and was named Bennu. The celestial object—or rather, its trajectory (its orbit around the Sun is approximately 1.2 years)—is being closely monitored by scientists because ""it is one of the potentially hazardous asteroids, like many other so-called near-Earth objects,” reveals Jean-Pierre Luminet, astrophysicist and author of the book *Unusual Celestial Bodies: The Latest Astronomical Discoveries*.', 'Esse é o asteroide Bennu, que pode atingir a Terra no ano 2135. pic.twitter.com/lLWyQyIlTR', 'This celestial body is much larger than its counterpart, 2024 YR4. “With a diameter of approximately 500 meters, calculations indicate that it is likely to collide with our planet between the years 2175 and 2199 with a probability of 1 in 3000,” admits the researcher. While the risk of a collision with Earth is low, if it did occur, the consequences would be devastating. Researchers from Pusan National University in South Korea simulated the impact effects.', 'Results: in the worst-case scenario, up to 400 million tons of dust would be propelled into the stratosphere. There would be a global temperature drop of 4°C, greater in the Northern Hemisphere due to the lack of sunlight blocked by the stratospheric dust. These consequences would occur if the asteroid struck Earth in the Western Hemisphere and in January.', '#Asteroid 2024_YR4 may collide with the Moon .\nIts nominal trajectory, based on updated observations, shows a lunar impact on Dec 22, 2032.\nBut the odds of collision remain low. pic.twitter.com/ayg7KgfZXp', 'The impact would not destroy Earth, but the consequences would be felt globally, with 15% less precipitation, a 32% drop in stratospheric ozone (i.e., greater UV exposure at the surface), decreased agricultural productivity—which would lead to global food insecurity—and even significant population migration, which would also cause health and social problems.', 'Bennu also has a scientific upside: its age! In fact, the asteroid is of particular interest to the scientific community because it could help answer the question of the origin of life on Earth. At 4.5 billion years old, Bennu is an “intact remnant of the formation of the Solar System,” explains Jean-Pierre Luminet.', 'He continues: “In 2018, the OSIRIS-Rex space probe visited it and collected 250 grams of samples. Placed in a capsule, the dust grains were recovered on Earth in 2023 for analysis. Rich in carbon, Bennu could contain primitive molecules present during the emergence of life on Earth.” The first results were published this past January and revealed traces of salty water and complex organic compounds.', '- LeFigaroSciences', '2025 Meteored.
