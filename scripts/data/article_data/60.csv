SiO and a super-stellar C/O ratio in the atmosphere of the giant exoplanet WASP-121 b,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02513-x,"['We use essential cookies to make sure the site can function.

This provides an opportunity to quantify the amount of refractory material accreted during formation, along with volatile gases and ices. However, simultaneous detections of refractories and volatiles have proved challenging, as the most prominent spectral features of associated atoms and molecules span a broad wavelength range. Here, using a single JWST observation of the ultrahot giant planet WASP-121\u2009b, we report detections of H2O (5.5–13.5σ), CO (10.8–12.8σ) and SiO (5.7–6.2σ) in the planet’s dayside atmosphere and CH4 (3.1–5.1σ) in the nightside atmosphere. We measure super-stellar values for the atmospheric C/H, O/H, Si/H and C/O ratios, which point to the joint importance of pebbles and planetesimals in giant planet formation. The CH4-rich nightside composition is also indicative of dynamical processes, such as strong vertical mixing, having a profound influence on the chemistry of ultrahot giant planets.', 'WASP-121\u2009b is an ‘ultrahot’ giant planet with dayside temperatures exceeding ~2,000\u2009K, high enough to prevent refractory elements from condensing. Provided the refractories are not cold-trapped on the cooler nightside, this makes it possible to constrain the refractory and volatile contents of the atmospheric envelope by measuring the dayside gas composition1. When combined with key elemental ratios such as the C/O ratio, the derived refractory and volatile abundances can provide insights into the planet’s formation history2. A practical challenge is that the wavelength coverages of available spectrographs have typically allowed detections of either refractory or volatile species, but not both, with the same observation. This is because the strongest spectral features of major refractory species—including Fe, Mg, Ca, SiO, TiO and VO—are at near-ultraviolet (near-UV) and optical wavelengths, whereas those of major volatile species such as H2O and CO occur at infrared wavelengths3,4.', 'We have used JWST to observe a ‘phase curve’ for WASP-121\u2009b, in which thermal emission from the system was continuously recorded as the planet completed an orbit around the host star5. As expected, the infrared wavelength range spanned by the measurement provides sensitivity to important volatiles such as H2O and CO in the planetary atmosphere. The precision of JWST also allows us to detect a relatively weak SiO band, delivering abundance constraints for a key refractory species. In addition, the complete orbital phase coverage enables separate characterization of the planet’s dayside and nightside temperature profiles and chemical compositions. This, in turn, allows us to explore how dynamical processes shape the global atmospheric chemistry, which can be driven out of equilibrium with local thermobaric conditions if gas transport occurs on sufficiently short timescales6,7,8,9.', 'We observed WASP-121\u2009b using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the G395H grism, covering the wavelength (λ) range 2.73–5.17\u2009μm. The observation lasted 37.8\u2009h and encompassed two consecutive secondary eclipses and a primary transit. We generated 349 wavelength-dependent ‘spectroscopic’ phase curves by binning each measured spectrum into 10-pixel-wide bins along the dispersion axis, translating to spectroscopic bin widths of Δλ\u2009=\u20096.7\u2009nm and a mean spectral resolving power of λ/Δλ\u2009≈\u2009600 across the G395H passband. Further details of the observation and data reduction are provided in ‘Observations and data reduction’ in Methods.', 'To fit the spectroscopic phase curves, we adopted a spherical harmonic dipole to describe the planetary brightness map and a quadratic limb-darkening law for the host star. A linear polynomial in time and the pixel coordinates of the target spectrum on the detector was simultaneously fitted to account for drift in the instrument baseline. We extracted the following three observables to characterize the planetary atmosphere from each spectroscopic phase-curve fit: the ratio of the disk-integrated planetary brightness to the disk-integrated stellar brightness (Fp/F⋆) as a function of orbital phase (ɸ); the phase offset of the planetary brightness map (Δɸ); and the effective planetary radius (Rp). Further details of the phase-curve fitting are given in ‘White phase-curve fitting’ and ‘Spectroscopic phase-curve fitting’ in Methods.', 'We binned the measured Fp/F⋆ values into 36 phase bins that avoided the two eclipses and transit, with each phase bin covering 46\u2009min of the planetary orbit (Extended Data Fig. 1). By doing this for each spectroscopic phase curve, we were able to obtain the planetary emission spectrum as a function of orbital phase (see ‘Generating the phase-resolved emission spectra’ in Methods). Figure 1 shows the resulting emission spectra for the phase bins immediately preceding the secondary eclipse and primary transit, when the dayside and nightside hemispheres of WASP-121\u2009b were maximally visible, respectively. To verify the robustness of these spectra, we confirmed that they were in good agreement with those produced by a second independent analysis (see ‘Independent data reduction’ in Methods). Emission spectra for the full set of orbital phase bins are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2.', 'a, Dayside planet-to-star emission based on n\u2009=\u20095,000 posterior samples from each of the 349 spectroscopic phase-curve fits.

We adopted widely used parametric forms for the dayside and nightside pressure–temperature (PT) profiles and assumed thermochemical equilibrium. We allowed the elemental abundances of carbon, oxygen and silicon to vary individually as free parameters, following tests that indicated molecules comprising these atoms accounted for the spectral features in the data. We set the relative abundances of all other heavy elements equal to the solar values and allowed them to vary collectively in the retrievals via an additional metallicity parameter. Further details are given in ‘Atmospheric retrieval analyses’ in Methods.', 'The outputs of these retrieval analyses are shown in Fig. 2. The PT profile for the dayside hemisphere exhibits a thermal inversion, in line with previous measurements for WASP-121\u2009b10. We find that the temperature increases from approximately 2,600 to 3,200\u2009K over the 10−1 to 10−3\u2009bar pressure range. Across the same pressure range, the inferred nightside PT profile cools from approximately 1,400 to 1,100\u2009K. To interpret the retrieved abundances for carbon, oxygen and silicon, we compared them to updated elemental abundances of the host star obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy (see ‘Stellar abundances and relative planetary abundances’ in Methods). For the dayside spectrum, we measure planetary ratios relative to the equivalent host-star ratios of \\({({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{H}})/({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{H}})}_{\\star }={23.96}_{-4.75}^{+6.13}\\), \\({({\\rm{O}}/{\\rm{H}})/({\\rm{O}}/{\\rm{H}})}_{\\star }={12.19}_{-2.24}^{+2.78}\\) and \\({({\\rm{Si}}/{\\rm{H}})/({\\rm{Si}}/{\\rm{H}})}_{\\star }={9.89}_{-2.89}^{+5.99}\\), where quoted values are the medians with 1σ uncertainties defined by the 16th and 84th percentiles (68% credible interval). The abundances for all three elements are super-stellar, with (C/H)/(C/H)⋆\u2009>\u200911.92, (O/H)/(O/H)⋆\u2009>\u20097.27 and (Si/H)/(Si/H)⋆\u2009>\u20092.49 at 99.99% probability. We derive a C/O ratio of \\({0.92}_{-0.03}^{+0.02}\\), which is >1.63 times the stellar ratio of (C/O)⋆ = 0.47\u2009±\u20090.06 at 99.99% probability. We also determine upper limits for the volatile/refractory ratios of (C/Si)/(C/Si)⋆\u2009<\u20098.07, (O/Si)/(O/Si)⋆\u2009<\u20094.02 and ((C\u2009+\u2009O)/Si)/((C\u2009+\u2009O)/Si)⋆\u2009<\u20095.24 at 99.99% probability. Posterior distributions for these elemental abundances and the derived ratios are shown in Fig. 3.', 'a, PT profiles inferred from the retrieval analysis for the dayside (red) and nightside (blue) atmospheres assuming thermochemical equilibrium.

The metallicity regulated the abundances of heavy elements besides C, O and Si, as described in the text. Vertical dashed lines indicate the corresponding values measured for the host star using high-resolution spectroscopy.', 'The abundances for different chemical species implied by the retrievals are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding contributions to the dayside and nightside emission spectra are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 3. On the dayside, the data trace out spectral features of H2O, SiO and CO in emission, with the H2O and SiO features muted considerably owing to thermal dissociation (Fig. 2). The measured amplitudes of the H2O and CO dayside emission features are comparable to those predicted by three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model (GCM) simulations for WASP-121\u2009b published in ref. 11 (Fig. 1), although the GCM spectra do not show an SiO feature. On the nightside, the data exhibit spectral features of CH4 in absorption, rather than H2O in absorption as had previously been reported for WASP-121\u2009b on the basis of HST observations at shorter wavelengths12. Using ‘free chemistry’ retrieval analyses that did not enforce the requirement of thermochemical equilibrium (see ‘Atmospheric retrieval analyses’ in Methods), we obtain statistically significant detections of dayside H2O (5.5–13.5σ), dayside CO (10.8–12.8σ), dayside SiO (5.7–6.2σ) and nightside CH4 (3.1–5.1σ).', 'We have obtained a conclusive detection of SiO in the atmosphere of WASP-121\u2009b. Evidence of SiO had previously been reported in the atmosphere of WASP-121\u2009b and another ultrahot gas giant, WASP-178\u2009b, on the basis of absorption signals measured at near-UV wavelengths13. However, these near-UV data could also be explained by Mg\u2009I and Fe\u2009II absorption, preventing an unambiguous identification of SiO. With NIRSpec, we are now able to verify the presence of SiO in the atmosphere of WASP-121\u2009b and, due to its properties as a strong absorber of shortwave radiation13, the important role that it is likely playing in driving the dayside thermal inversion. Furthermore, silicon is expected to be one of the primary cloud constituents in hot (~1,000–2,000\u2009K) atmospheres14 and can provide valuable information about the overall formation history of a planet, as it allows the volatile/refractory ratio to be constrained1,2. By delivering a robust measurement of a planetary atmosphere’s silicon abundance, our SiO detection stands out from previous detections of atomic silicon15,16 and silicate clouds17,18 that lacked abundance constraints.', 'A GCM simulation for WASP-121\u2009b that assumed solar metallicity and included SiO opacity was presented in ref.\u200919. The predicted dayside spectrum did not show the 4–4.3\u2009μm SiO band, as it was obscured by overlapping H2O and CO bands. Our NIRSpec observation demonstrates that in reality this will not always be the case, particularly if an atmosphere is enriched in silicon and oxygen, as we find for WASP-121\u2009b. It raises the possibility of further SiO detections with JWST in the future, which would complement efforts at UV wavelengths while being far less hampered by interstellar dust extinction and low UV fluxes of host stars.', 'Our finding that the C/H, O/H and C/O ratios of WASP-121\u2009b are all super-stellar provides evidence that the planet accreted most of its volatiles as gas that was enriched by inward-drifting pebbles20,21,22. The super-stellar C/O and C/H ratios in particular may indicate that WASP-121\u2009b accreted most of its gaseous envelope beyond the H2O ice line but within the CH4 ice line, where the gas-phase carbon abundance could have been locally elevated by the evaporation of inward-drifting CH4-rich pebbles22. If WASP-121\u2009b instead accreted most of its volatiles as icy planetesimals between the H2O and CO ice lines, the oxygen-rich composition of these planetesimals should have produced a sub-stellar C/O ratio23. Alternatively, a sub-stellar volatile inventory would be expected if the volatiles were accreted from gas that had not been enriched by evaporating pebbles21.', 'While gas accretion seems to have delivered the bulk of volatiles, our finding of a super-stellar Si/H ratio (Fig. 3) suggests that there was also substantial enrichment by refractory solids following accretion of the gaseous envelope24,25. We calculate that our measured silicon abundance is consistent with the addition of approximately \\({21.2}_{-6.6}^{+11.8}\\,M_{\\oplus}\\) (where \\(M_{\\oplus}\\) is the mass of the Earth) of rocky material to the atmosphere (see ‘Accretion of rocky material’ in Methods), which is comparable to predictions of planetesimal accretion models26,27. By contrast, it may not be possible for pebbles to deliver this quantity of refractory material, as the accretion of solid pebbles should largely cease once the pebble isolation mass is reached28. After this point, the planet would continue to accrete volatile-rich gas and obtain an atmosphere that has a sub-stellar silicon abundance or a higher volatile/refractory ratio than we have observed (Fig. 3). For example, in the pebble accretion simulations of ref.\u200924 that produced super-stellar C/H, O/H and C/O values, the (C\u2009+\u2009O)/Si ratio rises to at least ten times the stellar ratio.', 'Super-stellar C/O constraints have recently been obtained for WASP-121\u2009b using ground-based spectroscopy3,4, underscoring the robustness of this particular result. Combined with their own measurement of a super-stellar volatile/refractory ratio, the authors of ref.\u20094 proposed a broadly similar formation scenario to the one that we have outlined, with WASP-121\u2009b accreting most of its atmospheric envelope in a volatile-rich environment beyond the H2O ice line. In contrast, the authors of ref.\u20093 recovered a sub-stellar volatile/refractory ratio, which they interpreted as evidence for formation within the H2O ice line and accretion dominated by refractory-rich planetesimals rather than volatile ices. Ultimately, these tensions between available datasets will need to be resolved to uncover a clearer picture of how WASP-121\u2009b formed.', 'We also stress the broader difficulties in linking a planet’s observed composition to its formation history. Various complications are reviewed in refs.\u20091,2,22,29 and include: accretion from compositionally distinct regions within the protoplanetary disk due to orbital migration; unknown dust opacity and self-shadowing affecting the thermal structure and associated chemistry of the disk; time-dependent chemical and physical evolution of the disk; and erosion of the planetary core raising the heavy element content of the atmospheric envelope. Further investigation of such effects will be required to rigorously assess the basic qualitative picture we have presented here for the formation of WASP-121\u2009b.', 'Regarding the chemistry of the atmosphere, the evidence we have uncovered for CH4 on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b was not anticipated. One reason for this is that models of hot giant planet atmospheres have tended to assume atmospheric C/O ratios close to the solar value of approximately 0.55 (ref.\u200930). This leads to dayside and nightside spectra sculpted by H2O and CO, as seen for the GCM of ref.\u200911 (Fig. 1). When the C/O ratio is increased from 0.55 to our measured value of 0.92, the nightside CO abundance changes little, but the CH4 abundance increases by 2–4 orders of magnitude and the H2O abundance decreases by a similarly large amount (Extended Data Fig. 4). Sequestration of oxygen into the various oxygen-bearing condensates shown in Fig. 2 can further reduce the H2O abundance31. As a result, the atmospheric opacity becomes dominated by CH4, explaining why H2O, CO and SiO are not detected on the nightside (Extended Data Fig. 3). Although the CO opacity is stronger than the CH4 opacity within narrow line cores across the 4–4.5\u2009μm wavelength range, the effect this has on the emission spectrum is too subtle to be detected at the resolution of the data (Fig. 1).', 'When the dynamics of the atmosphere are taken into account, a high C/O ratio by itself cannot easily explain our measured abundance of CH4 on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b. Simulations of hot giant planets find that horizontal winds with speeds of ~1–10\u2009km\u2009s−1 advect gas between the dayside and nightside hemispheres at pressures below ~1\u2009bar (refs.\u20098,19,32,33). This would mean that gas traverses the nightside hemisphere of WASP-121\u2009b on typical timescales of ~104–106\u2009s, which is substantially shorter than the timescales required to reach chemical equilibrium. Specifically, we find that the nightside infrared photosphere coincides with pressures of ~102–10−4\u2009bar and temperatures of ~1,200\u2009K (Fig. 2), where the timescales for CH4 and CO to reach their local equilibrium abundances would be ~1010\u2009s and ~1015\u2009s, respectively9,34. Conversely, on the dayside, high temperatures translate to chemical reaction timescales that are shorter than dynamical timescales throughout the observable atmosphere, allowing chemical equilibrium to be established. If horizontal winds dominate the transport of gas throughout the observable atmosphere8, we would expect gas to reach equilibrium with the dayside conditions and then be quenched as it travels across the nightside, preserving its CH4-poor composition.', 'We propose instead that vertical mixing on the nightside hemisphere is efficiently transporting CH4-rich gas up to the infrared photosphere from deeper layers of the atmosphere that are in chemical equilibrium. To test this hypothesis, we performed 1D model calculations for the nightside chemistry with vertical mixing parameterized by an eddy diffusion coefficient (Kzz). We adopted the retrieved nightside PT profile shown in Fig. 2 but started with the dayside chemical composition. The latter can be thought of as a conservative assumption, equivalent to instantaneous advection of gas from the dayside to the nightside. We then evolved the composition of the gas over timescales ranging from 104–106\u2009s for a range of Kzz values between 109\u2009cm2\u2009s−1 and 1013\u2009cm2\u2009s−1 using a C–H–N–O–S non-equilibrium chemical network35. Figure 4 shows the resulting CH4 abundances predicted at the infrared photosphere. We find that the measured CH4 abundance can be reproduced with Kzz values of ~109–1012\u2009cm2\u2009s−1, which are consistent with available constraints36,37. The predicted CH4 abundance is also higher than the H2O abundance, in line with our detection of CH4 and non-detection of H2O on the nightside. Similar results were obtained when we repeated the calculations using the PT profiles from the GCM simulation of ref.\u200911 (Extended Data Fig. 5). From these analyses, we deduce that gas mixed vertically from deeper layers of the atmosphere is setting the composition at the infrared photosphere, rather than horizontally quenched CH4-poor gas transported from the dayside, as is often seen in dynamical simulations7,8.', 'a, Pressure-dependent VMR profiles for CH4, H2O and CO assuming equilibrium chemistry (dashed lines) and non-equilibrium chemistry (solid lines). The non-equilibrium chemistry calculations adopted Kzz\u2009=\u20091011\u2009cm2\u2009s−1 and were evolved over a timescale of 105\u2009s.

The orange shading is the same as in a. The dashed grey line shows the retrieved CH4 VMR for the dayside, which was adopted as the starting abundance.', 'Vertical mixing also offers a natural explanation for why silicon is not cold-trapped on the nightside hemisphere of WASP-121\u2009b, as demonstrated by our detection of SiO on the dayside. Recent microphysical modelling has found that cloud formation should occur rapidly in hot giant planet atmospheres on timescales of ~1\u2009s (ref.\u200938). We thus expect clouds of silicates to form efficiently on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b at pressures of ~10−1–1\u2009bar, where the measured temperature profile crosses the condensation curves of MgSiO3, Mg2SiO4 and SiO2 (Fig. 2). As mentioned above, iron and magnesium have also been detected in the atmosphere of WASP-121\u2009b, along with numerous other refractory metals such as vanadium, chromium and nickel39,40,41. The same mixing that we hypothesize is transporting CH4 upwards to the observable atmosphere is likely preventing these refractory species from condensing on the nightside and becoming permanently cold-trapped in the deep atmosphere. A notable exception is titanium, for which non-detections provide strong evidence of being efficiently cold-trapped40,41. However, despite conditions being favourable for the formation of various refractory clouds on the nightside, we find that models including clouds do not appreciably improve the fit to the available data (see ‘Discussion of the retrieval analyses’ in Methods). At the same time, we are unable to rule out clouds at pressures above ~10−1\u2009bar, as such clouds would not necessarily produce an observable signature (Extended Data Fig. 6).', 'GCM simulations will be valuable for further investigating the potential role played by nightside clouds. For example, existing cloud-free GCMs predict nightside temperatures that are warmer than we measure, particularly at pressures >10−2\u2009bar (Extended Data Fig. 5), resulting in strong emission peaks between absorption bands that are not observed in the data (Fig. 1). Nightside clouds may help to reduce this discrepancy by blocking emission from the deepest, warmest layers of the atmosphere42,43,44,45. Other effects, such as magnetic influences through Lorentz forces, could also play an important role in lowering nightside temperatures by reducing the efficiency of day–night heat recirculation46,47,48.', 'The WASP-121 system was continuously monitored for 37.8\u2009h on 2022 October 14–15 using the Bright Object Time Series mode of the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. The observation began 145\u2009min before secondary eclipse ingress and finished 105\u2009min after egress of the following secondary eclipse. As the planet is obscured during secondary eclipses, this allowed us to calibrate the brightness level of the host star at both the start and end of the observation. Light received from the WASP-121\u2009b system was dispersed across the two 2,048\u2009×\u20092,048 pixel HgCdTe detectors at the NIRSpec focal plane by the G395H grism. The two detectors, denoted NRS1 and NRS2, provide continuous wavelength coverage between 2.70–3.72\u2009μm and 3.82–5.15\u2009μm, respectively. For each integration, 2,048\u2009×\u200932 pixel subarrays were read from both detectors using the NRSRAPID readout pattern with 42 groups per integration, translating to individual integration times of 38.8\u2009s. A total of 3,504 integrations was acquired over the full observation. There were five high-gain antenna movements during the observation, which caused small, but noticeable, deviations in the measured fluxes for five of the integrations. We retained these impacted integrations in our analysis, as we expect them to have a negligible effect on the overall results.', 'To analyse the data, we started by using the FIREFLy code49 to extract the source spectrum from each integration. Further details of our FIREFLy reduction can be found in ref.\u20095. From the resulting time series of spectra, separate ‘white’ phase curves were generated for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors by summing the spectra from each detector across the full wavelength range. We also binned the spectra into narrower 10-pixel-wide channels along the dispersion axis, producing 349 spectroscopic phase curves.', 'Before fitting the spectroscopic phase curves, we refined our estimates for various system parameters by performing a joint fit to the higher-signal-to-noise white phase curves. For each white phase curve, our model Π took the form Π\u2009=\u2009α\u2009×\u2009β, where α is the astrophysical signal and β is the instrument baseline.', 'We used the starry package50 to model the time-dependent astrophysical signal α. starry accounts for emission from both the star and the planet, as well as primary transits and secondary eclipses. We adopted a degree \\({\\mathcal{l}}=1\\) spherical harmonic expansion for the planetary brightness map and a quadratic limb-darkening profile for the star.', 'For the instrument baseline β, we investigated three forms. First, a linear trend with respect to time t:', 'Second, a linear trend with respect to t and the xy pointing jitter coordinates described in ref. 5:', 'Third, a linear trend with respect to t, plus an exponential function:', 'We note that β3 allows for an initial settling of the telescope following a new pointing. Baselines of this form have mostly been used for analyses of JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) light curves, which tend to exhibit prominent ramp-like systematics lasting ~30–60\u2009min at the beginning of an exposure51.', 'In the fitting, the following parameters were shared across both the NRS1 and NRS2 white phase curves: stellar mass (M⋆); planet mass (Mp); orbital inclination (i); logarithm of the stellar radius (log10R⋆); and deviation in the orbital period (ΔPorb) from the value of Porb =\u20091.27492504\u2009±\u20091.5\u2009×\u200910−7\u2009days reported in ref.\u200952. We fitted the following parameters separately for each detector: the logarithm of the planetary radius (log10Rp); the deviation in the transit mid-time (ΔTmid) from the value of Tmid\u2009=\u20092,459,867.64297\u2009±\u20090.00027\u2009BJDTDB predicted by the ephemerides of ref.\u200952; the relative planet-to-star luminosity (A); the coefficient of the Y1,0 spherical harmonic (y1,0); the phase offset of the planetary brightness map (Δɸ); the coefficients of the stellar limb-darkening profile (u1 and u2); the instrument baseline parameters (c0, c1, cx, cy, r0 and r1); and a high-frequency systematics noise term (σsyst), explained below. We also tested more elaborate planetary brightness maps comprising combinations of the Y1,0, Y1,1 and Y2,0 spherical harmonics, with the associated coefficients treated as free parameters in the model fitting. However, we found that a planetary brightness map described by Y1,0 alone was favoured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).', 'For each white phase-curve fit, a multivariate normal distribution was adopted for the likelihood function and marginalized using affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo, as implemented by the emcee package53. We used 150 walkers and took 5,000 steps to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, following an initial burn-in phase of 500 steps. Note that when evaluating the likelihood function, the error bar on the ith data point was taken to be the quadrature sum \\({\\sigma }_{i}=\\sqrt{{\\sigma }_{\\text{Poiss},i}^{2}+{\\sigma }_{\\text{syst}}^{2}}\\), where σPoiss,i was the estimated Poisson noise for the ith data point returned by the instrument pipeline and σsyst was a free parameter allowing for additional high-frequency systematics.', 'This overall methodology for fitting the white phase curves is similar to that used in ref.\u20095, but with a few variations. First, we adopted different priors for a subset of parameters. In particular, normal priors were adopted for M⋆ and Mp based on a radial velocity analysis of the G395H data54. Normal priors obtained using the exoTiC-LD package55 were also adopted for the wavelength-dependent limb-darkening coefficients (u1 and u2). Details of all adopted priors are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Second, we allowed ΔTmid to vary separately for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, whereas ref. 5 adopted a shared transit mid-time for both detectors. Third, although the beginning of the exposure was not visibly affected by strong systematics, we discarded the first 45\u2009min of data before fitting. This precautionary step was taken to provide ample time for the telescope to settle into its new pointing, while still retaining 100\u2009min of pre-eclipse baseline.', 'Of the three instrumental baselines tested (β1, β2 and β3), we found that β2 gave the lowest BIC. The results of the corresponding fit are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1, and are generally consistent with those reported in ref. 5 to within 1σ. However, >1σ differences are observed for a subset of parameters, namely: Δɸ for NRS1 is 3.7σ lower; Δɸ for NRS2 is 2.3σ lower; y1,0 for NRS1 is 1.7σ lower; σsyst for NRS1 is 1.5σ lower; and σsyst for NRS2 is 3.3σ lower. These differences could arise from one or more of the analysis variations noted above. For example, the adoption of exoTiC-LD priors for the limb-darkening coefficients seems to have driven u1 and u2 away from the values found in ref. 5, which adopted substantially broader priors for those parameters. Nonetheless, the primary purpose of the white phase-curve fit was to refine the values of M⋆, log10R⋆, Mp, ΔPorb and i in particular, as these parameters were subsequently held fixed for the spectroscopic phase-curve fits (see next section). The updated values for the latter all agree to better than 0.8σ with those reported in ref. 5 and ref.\u200956.', 'We also note that for the maximum a posteriori model—which in general we refer to as the ‘best-fit’ model—the root mean square (r.m.s.) of the residuals is found to be 126\u2009ppm for the NRS1 phase curve and 153\u2009ppm for the NRS2 phase curve, compared with Poisson uncertainties derived from the data reduction pipeline of 92 and 137\u2009ppm, respectively. The scatter in the residuals bins down more slowly than expected for uncorrelated noise (Supplementary Fig. 2), which suggests that our instrument baseline model has not captured all of the systematics in the data. This should be inconsequential for the final atmospheric spectra that we obtain for WASP-121\u2009b, as the white phase-curve fit is only used to refine our estimates for M⋆, log10R⋆, Mp, ΔPorb and i. Our posterior distributions for these parameters are fully consistent with the priors (Supplementary Fig. 1), which were adapted from the independent measurements cited above and in ref.\u20095. The sole exception is i, for which our refined value of \\({{87.97}_{-0.15}^{+0.17}}^{\\circ}\\) is significantly lower than the prior value of 88.49\u2009±\u20090.16° taken from ref.\u200952. However, even if this ~0.5° difference between the prior and posterior for i is caused by uncorrected systematics in our white phase-curve fit, this would have a negligible effect on the final atmospheric spectra that we derive from the spectroscopic phase-curve fits described in the next section.', 'The spectroscopic phase curves were fitted in a similar fashion to the white phase curves. The main difference was that for each spectroscopic phase-curve fit, a subset of model parameters that are not expected to vary with wavelength were held fixed to the best-fit solution from the white phase-curve fit reported in Supplementary Table 1, namely: M⋆, log10R⋆, Mp, ΔPorb and i. All other parameters were allowed to vary separately in each spectroscopic phase-curve fit, including ΔTmid and Δɸ. As for the white phase-curve fit, emcee was used to marginalize the posterior distribution for each spectroscopic phase curve, with 150 walkers, 500 burn-in steps and 5,000 sampling steps.', 'Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a selection of spectroscopic phase-curve fits spanning a range of fit qualities as measured by the χ2 statistic. We find that the fit residuals are well-behaved and consistent with white noise. This is conveyed in the bottom panels of Supplementary Fig. 3, which provide a summary of the noise properties for the spectroscopic phase-curve fit residuals. The bottom left panel shows that the histograms of residuals taken across all wavelength channels are very close to normally distributed, with means close to zero and standard deviations within 2% of the pipeline Poisson noise. The bottom right panel shows the Allan deviations for the phase-curve residuals, with the r.m.s. of the residuals reducing at a rate of \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) where N is the number of data points per bin.', 'To extract the phase-resolved planetary emission spectra, we started by randomly selecting 5,000 posterior samples from each spectroscopic phase-curve fit. For each of these posterior samples, we generated the corresponding systematics baseline (β) and divided the associated data by this baseline to give a ‘corrected’ phase curve. We then binned the corrected data into 36 phase bins, each of 46\u2009min duration. In defining the locations of the phase bins, we were careful to avoid the secondary eclipses and primary transit. Our chosen bins are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1, along with simplified representations of the relative fractions of the dayside and nightside hemispheres of the planet that were visible at each phase. The bin numbers are denoted nɸ, which increases in chronological order from nɸ\u2009=\u20091 for the first phase bin to nɸ\u2009=\u200936 for the last phase bin. In each phase bin, we took the median of the binned values generated from the 5,000 posterior samples as our measurement of Fp/F⋆. To calculate the uncertainty, we took the quadrature sum \\(\\sqrt{{\\sigma }_{{\\rm{r}}}^{2}+{\\sigma }_{{\\rm{s}}}^{2}}\\), where σr denotes a random component and σs denotes a systematic component. For σr, we calculated the standard deviation of the model residuals in a given phase bin, then divided by \\({\\sqrt{N_j}}\\), where Nj is the number of data points in the phase bin. We repeated this for all of the 5,000 posterior samples and took the median of these values as σr. To calculate σs, we first binned the phase-curve models (α) computed from each of the 5,000 posterior samples into the 36 phase bins. We then took the standard deviation of these binned α values in each phase bin as the σs value for that phase bin. This process was undertaken separately for each of the 349 wavelength channels to generate the full set of phase-resolved, wavelength-dependent Fp/F⋆ measurements with uncertainties.', 'We repeated this process for independent sets of spectroscopic phase-curve fits performed using each of the instrument baselines (β1, β2 and β3). We found that the resulting emission spectra obtained with β1 and β2 were consistent to within 1σ in all wavelength channels. The emission spectra obtained with β1 and β3 were consistent to within 1σ in all but one of the wavelength channels, with the values obtained for the latter channel still being consistent to within 1.2σ. β1 was favoured by the BIC over β2 and β3 in 322 and 345 of the 349 wavelength channels, respectively. For the subset of channels in which either β2 or β3 was favoured by the BIC, the emission spectrum value obtained for each channel was always consistent to within 1σ of the corresponding value obtained with β1. Given the overall BIC preference for β1, along with the consistency of results obtained for each of the baselines tested, we adopt the emission spectra obtained using β1 from this point onwards in our analysis.', 'As a check, we performed a second data reduction using the Eureka! pipeline57. The steps we took were similar to those of ref.\u200958, with a few modifications. For Stage 1, we set the up-the-ramp jump-detection threshold to 10σ, rather than the default 4σ, to avoid pixels being erroneously flagged as outliers. We corrected 1/f noise at the group-level within Eureka!’s Stage 1 by masking the trace and performing a column-by-column subtraction. For each column, we determined the offset to be subtracted by first excluding outliers >3 times the median of the unmasked pixels and fitting a zeroth-order polynomial to the remaining pixels in the column. We also applied a scale factor for the bias correction of each integration and both detectors using a smoothing filter calculated from the first group. Before extracting the spectrum from each integration, we corrected for the curvature of the G395H trace using the method described in ref.\u200958 and performed a column-by-column background subtraction. For the background subtraction, we fitted a flat line to the pixels more than seven pixels away from the central row of the trace in that column. Before fitting to the background pixels, we performed two iterations of outlier masking, adopting outlier thresholds of 5σ along the time axis and >5 times the median along the spatial axis. The time-series spectra were then extracted from the background-subtracted integrations using optimal extraction59 with an aperture of 7 pixels.', 'We generated phase curves from the Eureka! time-series spectra and fitted them using the same methodology described above for the FIREFLy data. Supplementary Fig. 4 compares the resulting nightside (nɸ\u2009=\u200918) and dayside (nɸ\u2009=\u200934) spectra to those obtained from the FIREFLy analysis. For the dayside and nightside, the pairs of spectra agree to within 1-σ for 344 and 341 of the 349 wavelength channels, respectively. Of the remaining channels, the agreement is better than 2σ for seven of the nightside channels and four of the dayside channels. This leaves a single channel of each spectrum for which the difference between the two analyses is >2σ. Namely, we obtain a 3.5σ difference for the 2.755\u2009μm channel of the nightside spectrum, which is close to the short-wavelength edge of the NRS1 passband, and a similar 3.4σ difference for the 3.860\u2009μm channel of the dayside spectrum. As these >2σ discrepancies are restricted to a single channel at each phase, they should not affect the interpretation of the spectra, which overall exhibit excellent agreement (Supplementary Fig. 4).', 'To characterize the dayside and nightside hemispheres of WASP-121\u2009b, we performed retrieval analyses using five independent codes: ATMO60,61,62,63,64, NEMESIS65,66, CHIMERA67, HyDRA68,69,70 and PETRA71. The varying set-ups used for each of these codes are described below. Opacity sources considered by the retrieval codes72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Further details of each retrieval code can be found in previous studies that have used them for exoplanet emission retrieval analyses, of which we cite a number of relevant examples here: ATMO was used in ref.\u2009109 and ref.\u2009110 to analyse the dayside emission of WASP-121\u2009b measured with HST and Spitzer; NEMESIS was used in ref.\u200951 to analyse the dayside and nightside spectra of WASP-43\u2009b measured with JWST; CHIMERA was used in ref.\u2009111 to analyse the dayside and nightside spectra of the warm sub-Neptune GJ1214\u2009b measured with JWST; HyDRA was used in ref.\u2009112 to analyse the dayside emission spectrum of the ultrahot giant planet WASP-18\u2009b measured with JWST; and PETRA was used in ref.\u200971 to analyse the HST and Spitzer emission spectra of the hot giant planets HD 209458\u2009b and WASP-43\u2009b, as well as a synthetic JWST emission spectrum for the ultrahot giant planet KELT-9\u2009b.', 'For this study of WASP-121\u2009b, we have restricted our retrieval analyses to the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 and nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectra, which are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen in Extended Data Fig. 1, the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectrum corresponds to the phase bin immediately preceding the second secondary eclipse, while the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum corresponds to the phase bin immediately preceding the primary transit. In practice, we chose the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 and nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectra to characterize the dayside and nightside hemispheres, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1). However, it is important to note that retrieval results can potentially be biased if the measured emission at a given phase is modelled without allowing for inhomogeneous properties across the visible hemisphere113,114. This is particularly relevant for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 phase bin, where the nightside hemisphere dominates the fractional area coverage of the planetary disk, but the thin crescent of visible dayside hemisphere may still contribute meaningfully to the measured emission. We took two approaches to investigate how contamination by the dayside crescent affected the retrieval results for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum. The first approach, taken for the NEMESIS retrieval, was to explicitly model each spectrum as a weighted sum of dayside and nightside contributions. The second approach, taken for the CHIMERA and HyDRA retrievals, was to include an additional free parameter in the form of the ‘dilution factor’ described in ref.\u2009114.', 'The retrieval analyses presented in the following sections were performed on the 349-channel spectra (grey points in Fig. 1) and provided excellent fits to the data. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows histograms of the residuals for the best-fit models from each retrieval. In all cases, the residuals closely follow normal distributions. The reduced chi-squared values (\\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}\\)) are also printed in each panel. For the ATMO equilibrium chemistry retrievals, we obtain \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}=1.12\\) for the dayside spectrum (nɸ\u2009=\u200934) and \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}=1.09\\) for the nightside spectrum (nɸ\u2009=\u200918). The \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}\\) values for all of the free chemistry retrievals (NEMESIS, PETRA, HyDRA and CHIMERA) fall between 1.04 and 1.10. Unless stated otherwise, reported results are median values with 1σ uncertainties defined by the 16th and 84th percentiles (68% credible interval).', 'We used ATMO to perform independent retrievals for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 and nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectra. For each of the two retrievals, a single PT profile was assumed. Specifically, we adopted three-parameter115 and five-parameter116,117,118 analytical forms to model the PT profiles for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 and nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectra, respectively. The five-parameter PT profile was adopted for the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectrum to allow more flexibility in capturing the shape of the dayside thermal inversion. We fixed the internal temperature to 500\u2009K based on the results of ref.\u2009119. By adopting a single PT profile for each phase, we did not explicitly allow for the possibility of temperature inhomogeneities across the visible hemisphere. However, as described below, additional tests performed with NEMESIS, CHIMERA and HyDRA demonstrate that this should not notably bias the final results.', 'For the chemistry, we allowed the carbon, oxygen and silicon abundances to vary as separate free parameters, while the relative abundances of all other heavy elements were held fixed to the solar values and varied jointly via an additional ‘metallicity’ parameter. ATMO adopts the solar abundances of ref.\u2009120, except for C, N, O, P, S, K and Fe, which are taken from ref.\u200930. Given the PT profile and elemental abundances, the abundances of chemical species were then calculated assuming thermochemical equilibrium, which was done by minimizing the Gibbs free energy. The adopted priors for each model parameter are listed in Supplementary Table 3. The posterior distribution was sampled using nested sampling121.', 'The results of the ATMO retrieval are shown in Figs. 1–3. As already noted in the main text, spectral features of H2O, CO, SiO and CH4 allow the carbon, oxygen and silicon abundances to be constrained, as well as the atmospheric PT profile (Fig. 1). We confirm the dayside thermal inversion and infer a nightside PT profile that cools with decreasing pressure (Fig. 2), in agreement with previous studies of WASP-121\u2009b10,12. For the dayside (nɸ\u2009=\u200934), we obtain VMRs of \\({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{H}}={\\mathrm{8,036}}_{-1,442}^{+1,771}\\,{\\mathrm{ppm}}\\) and \\({\\rm{O}}/{\\rm{H}}={\\mathrm{8,741}}_{-1,516}^{+1,897}\\,{\\mathrm{ppm}}\\), and derive a tight constraint for the atmospheric C/O ratio of \\({0.92}_{-0.03}^{+0.02}\\) (Fig. 3). We also obtain \\({\\rm{Si}}/{\\rm{H}}={491}_{-138}^{+244}\\,{\\mathrm{ppm}}\\) for the dayside, which, combined with the C/H and O/H measurements, allow us to derive \\({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{Si}}={15.78}_{-4.69}^{+7.22}\\), \\({\\rm{O}}/{\\rm{Si}}={17.07}_{-4.74}^{+7.49}\\) and \\(({\\rm{C}}+{\\rm{O}})/{\\rm{Si}}={32.84}_{-9.42}^{+14.73}\\). For the nightside (nɸ\u2009=\u200918), we obtain \\({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{H}}={\\mathrm{6,794}}_{-5,083}^{+10,399}\\,{\\mathrm{ppm}}\\), which is consistent with the dayside constraint, but relatively weak owing to the lower signal-to-noise of the nightside emission. As described below for the free chemistry NEMESIS, PETRA, HyDRA and CHIMERA retrievals, we do not detect any O-bearing or Si-bearing species on the nightside, preventing us from obtaining useful constraints on the absolute O/H and Si/H abundances. However, we are able to constrain the relative nightside abundances to be C/O\u2009>\u20090.72 and C/Si\u2009>\u20090.74 at 95% probability, which are consistent with the dayside results.', 'The pressure-dependent VMRs for H2O, CO, CO2, SiO and CH4 derived under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium are shown for the nightside and dayside atmospheres in Fig. 2. At a pressure of 10−2\u2009bar on the nightside, we obtain base-10 logarithmic VMRs of \\({-2.25}_{-0.44}^{+0.14}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CH4 and \\({-2.73}_{-0.73}^{+0.29}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CO. The equivalent logarithmic VMRs at a pressure of 10−2\u2009bar on the dayside are \\({-12.38}_{-0.12}^{+0.10}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CH4 and \\({-2.00}_{-0.10}^{+0.10}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CO. For H2O, CO2 and SiO, thermal dissociation reduces the dayside abundances at pressures below approximately 10−2\u2009bar for H2O and CO2, and below approximately 10−3\u2009bar for SiO. Note that photodissociation—which was not modelled—may further reduce molecular abundances at pressures below 10−5\u2009bar (ref.\u2009122). Deeper in the dayside atmosphere at a pressure of 10−1\u2009bar, where neither thermal dissociation nor photodissociation reduce the abundances, the logarithmic VMRs are \\({-3.57}_{-0.16}^{+0.18}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for H2O, \\({-6.13}_{-0.25}^{+0.24}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CO2 and \\({-3.12}_{-0.14}^{+0.18}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for SiO. The nightside SiO abundance is weakly constrained, but nonetheless consistent with the inferred dayside abundance, while the nightside abundances of H2O and CO2 are found to be less than 1\u2009ppm and 1\u2009ppb, respectively.', 'Although abundances for many other species are predicted by the ATMO retrievals under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, we focus on H2O, CO, CO2, SiO and CH4 because (with the exception of CO2) they are the only ones that the free chemistry retrievals find direct evidence for in the data (see below). The detection of these molecules is also supported by the wavelength-dependent contribution functions for the ATMO retrievals, which are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. The dayside contribution function traces out spectral features of H2O, SiO and CO, while the nightside contribution function exhibits the distinctive spectral signature of CH4. Supplementary Fig. 6 highlights the dayside SiO emission signal in particular, as it is relatively subtle compared with the dayside H2O and CO signals. We discuss the nightside CH4 signal in more detail below. From the contribution functions, we also note that the data seem to be probing a greater range of pressures on the nightside than the dayside. The absolute gradient inferred for the nightside temperature profile is much lower than that inferred for the dayside (Fig. 3), meaning that a relatively large range of pressures must be sampled to reproduce the spectral features observed in the nightside spectrum.', 'Extended Data Fig. 5 compares our retrieved PT profiles to those of various models that self-consistently treat the radiative transfer and chemistry of the atmosphere. Specifically, we show PT profiles for a range of dayside and nightside longitudes from published MITgcm11 and Exo-FMS19 3D GCM simulations, as well as 1D radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium models computed with ATMO for internal temperatures of 100\u2009K and 500\u2009K, assuming the elemental abundances derived from the retrieval. Although the 3D models adopted solar elemental abundances, it is still interesting to make a preliminary comparison between the thermal profiles that they predict and those that we infer from the data. On the dayside, the retrieved PT profile is broadly consistent with the temperatures spanned by the self-consistent 1D and 3D models across the ~10−1 to ~10−3\u2009bar pressure range probed by the data (Fig. 2). On the nightside, the retrieved temperatures are similar to those predicted by the MITgcm simulation for pressures below ~10−2\u2009bar, but cooler at higher pressures. The Exo-FMS simulation predicts considerably warmer nightside temperatures at all pressures compared with our retrieved temperatures.', 'We used NEMESIS to perform a joint retrieval for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 and nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectra. We considered the measured Fp at each phase to be the weighted sum of dayside and nightside components:', 'where Fday and Fnight denote the emission from the dayside and nightside hemispheres, respectively, and w is a geometric term giving the fraction of the visible hemisphere at orbital phase ɸ taken up by the dayside hemisphere123. For the latter, we used:', 'and fixed Δϕ\u2009=\u2009−3°, namely, the measured phase offset for the planetary brightness map rounded to the nearest degree (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). We also allowed for the difference in the average emission angle from the dayside segment between the two phases. This could be particularly important for the dayside segment of the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum, which will be limb-darkened or limb-brightened in different spectral regions depending on the PT profile. We calculate the weighted-average emission angle of the dayside segment to be 76° at nɸ\u2009=\u200918 and 45° at phase nɸ\u2009=\u200934, and took these differences into account when computing the measured emission at each phase according to equation (1). We did not consider a similar correction for the nightside segment of phase nɸ\u2009=\u200934 to be necessary, because it makes a very small contribution to the overall spectrum measured at that phase.', 'We adopted a free chemistry approach for the NEMESIS retrieval, in which abundances of select chemical species were allowed to vary as free parameters without requiring thermochemical equilibrium to be satisfied. The chemical species considered were H2O, H−, CO, CO2, CH4 and SiO. Abundances for these species were varied separately for the Fday and Fnight model components. We allowed for the possibility of H2O being thermally dissociated on the dayside by varying its abundance with P according to Pτ above some base pressure level P0, which has been shown to provide a reasonable approximation for the effects of thermal dissociation11. In addition to the H2O abundance for P\u2009>\u2009P0, we varied τ and P0 as free parameters in the retrieval. All other abundances—including the nightside H2O abundance—were assumed to be uniform in pressure. We adopted separate six-parameter PT profiles124 for the dayside and nightside. Priors for each model parameter are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Posterior sampling was performed using the pymultinest125 implementation of MultiNest121,126 nested sampling.', 'As with the ATMO retrieval, the NEMESIS retrieval recovers a thermal inversion on the dayside and a temperature profile that cools with decreasing pressure on the nightside (Supplementary Fig. 7). Tight abundance constraints indicate the presence of H2O, CO and SiO on the dayside, and CH4 on the nightside (Supplementary Fig. 7). We infer logarithmic VMRs of \\({-3.31}_{-0.26}^{+0.23}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for the deep-atmosphere H2O, \\({-1.29}_{-0.19}^{+0.13}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CO and \\({-2.66}_{-0.21}^{+0.16}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for SiO on the dayside and \\({-1.75}_{-0.66}^{+0.44}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CH4 on the nightside. We also find that the inferred dayside and nightside spectra extrapolate well to the other orbital phases (Extended Data Fig. 2).', 'To evaluate the significance of the CH4 detection, we performed two nightside-only NEMESIS retrievals, with CH4 included and with CH4 removed. In these additional retrievals, we also included C2H2, HCN and NH3, to ensure that the signal we observe really is due to CH4. By comparing the Bayesian evidence for this ‘null hypothesis’ retrieval without CH4 (\\({{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{0}\\)) to the Bayesian evidence of the model that included all of the molecules (\\({{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}\\)), we obtain a log Bayes factor (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}/{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{0}\\)) of \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=10.4\\). Under numerous empirically calibrated evidence scales, this corresponds to the highest band of evidence in favour of a CH4 detection127,128,129. Following refs.\u2009130,131,132, we can also translate our \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}\\) value into an equivalent frequentist detection significance, as is common in the exoplanet literature. Using this approach, we obtain a detection significance of 4.9σ for CH4 on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b. Similar dayside-only retrievals were performed to obtain decisive detections of H2O (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=88.3\\), 13.5σ), CO (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=56.0\\), 10.8σ) and SiO (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=14.5\\), 5.7σ). Plots of the best-fit NEMESIS retrievals with and without each molecule are shown in Supplementary Figs. 8–11.', 'We additionally used NEMESIS to fit for a nightside cloud layer using the cloud parameterization of ref.\u2009133, as was done previously in ref.\u2009134. We fitted for the top pressure of an opaque, grey cloud (Ptop), and a scattering power-law index (γ) and opacity scaling (σ0) for a ‘haze’ above the cloud. From this retrieval, we are only able to provide a weak constraint for the cloud-top pressure being >10−3\u2009bar, while the remaining cloud parameters are effectively unconstrained.', 'We used CHIMERA to perform free chemistry retrievals for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum, focusing on characterization of the nightside atmosphere only. The chemical species considered were H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, HCN and NH3. We assumed that all VMRs were uniform with pressure, as the temperatures on the nightside are too low for thermal dissociation to be important. We performed separate retrievals adopting widely used three-parameter115, five-parameter116 and six-parameter124 functions for the PT profile. The three-parameter profile was the same as that used for the ATMO nightside analysis, the five-parameter profile was the same as that used for the ATMO dayside analysis and the six-parameter profile was the same as that used for the NEMESIS analyses. We also performed retrievals with and without the dilution factor described in ref.\u2009114 to account for contribution to the observed spectrum from the visible dayside crescent. The priors used for each model parameter are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Posterior samples were drawn using pymultinest125.', 'The retrievals performed for each PT profile support the presence of CH4, with \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=5.60\\) (3.8σ) for the three-parameter profile, \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=9.32\\) (4.7σ) for the five-parameter profile and \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=11.0\\) (5.1σ) for the six-parameter profile. The inferred PT profiles are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 7 and all cool with decreasing pressure across the 1–10−3\u2009bar pressure range. The six-parameter profile is essentially identical to the NEMESIS six-parameter profile and is also in good agreement with the HyDRA six-parameter profile (see below). The three-parameter profile is fully consistent with the ATMO three-parameter profile. Interestingly, the five-parameter profile exhibits an inversion for pressures below approximately 10−3\u2009bar, producing a narrow CH4 emission spike at 3.35\u2009μm while the broader CH4 features remain in absorption, which marginally improves the fit to the data (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, on the basis of the evaluated Bayesian evidence values, we do not find a clear preference for any one of the profiles in particular. Specifically, we obtain \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-192.72\\pm 0.07\\) for the three-parameter profile, \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-190.39\\pm 0.08\\) for the five-parameter profile and \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-191.56\\pm 0.06\\) for the six-parameter profile. A comparison of the CHIMERA best-fit models with and without CH4 for the five-parameter profile is shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.', 'As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, the corresponding logarithmic VMRs for CH4 are found to be \\({-2.43}_{-1.67}^{+0.91}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) (three-parameter), \\({-3.73}_{-0.57}^{+0.49}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) (five-parameter) and \\({-1.73}_{-0.78}^{+0.48}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) (six-parameter). Besides CH4, no evidence is obtained for any of the other chemical species that were considered. We also find that the inclusion of a dilution factor does not significantly affect the results and is not justified by the Bayesian evidence.', 'We used HyDRA to perform separate free chemistry retrievals for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 and nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectra. The chemical species considered for the dayside (nɸ\u2009=\u200934) were H2O, CO, CO2, SiO, SiO2, HCN, H−, OH, FeH, TiO and VO. For the nightside (nɸ\u2009=\u200918), we considered H2O, CO, CO2, SiO, SiO2, HCN, H− and CH4. Thermal dissociation was modelled for the dayside abundances of H2O, TiO, VO and H− using the methods of ref.\u200911. The deep abundances of each of these species were free parameters in the retrieval, while their pressure- and temperature-dependent abundance profiles were calculated using the coefficients in table 1 of ref.\u200911 as inputs to equations (1) and (2) of the same work. All other VMRs were assumed to be uniform in pressure. The six-parameter function124 was used to model the PT profiles at both phases. We tested the inclusion of clouds in the retrievals, which were parameterized by a modal particle size (ac), the cloud base pressure (Pc), a pressure exponent (ε), the cloud particle abundance (fc) and the cloud covering fraction (ψc). The cloud particle abundance was assumed to be zero at pressures greater than Pc, and to decrease at pressures less than Pc, such that at pressure P the abundance was fc(P/Pc)ε. We assumed an MgSiO3 cloud composition, and used the cloud absorption cross-sections from ref.\u2009135. The priors adopted for each model parameter are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Posterior sampling was performed using pymultinest125.', 'The HyDRA retrieval again recovers a thermal inversion for the dayside and a cooling PT profile for the nightside. On the dayside, decisive detections are made for CO with \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=78.7\\) (12.8σ), SiO with \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=17.5\\) (6.2σ) and H2O with \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=13.4\\) (5.5σ). The inferred logarithmic VMRs for CO and SiO on the dayside are \\(-{2.17}_{-0.37}^{+0.35}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) and \\(-{3.17}_{-0.34}^{+0.33}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\), respectively, while the logarithmic VMR for the deep atmosphere H2O is found to be \\(-{4.24}_{-0.32}^{+0.35}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\). We caution that the inferred SiO abundance may be biased, as it was assumed to be uniform in pressure, but in reality should be thermally dissociated (Fig. 2). On the nightside, the detection significance for CH4 is found to be \\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{B}}}_{10}=3.3\\) (3.1σ), with an inferred logarithmic VMR of \\({-2.05}_{-0.81}^{+0.55}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\). However, we also ran a separate retrieval analysis for the nightside spectrum with CH4 as the only opacity source and compared the Bayesian evidence to that obtained for a simple blackbody fit. In this restricted scenario, HyDRA decisively favours a model with CH4 absorption over a blackbody with \\(\\mathrm{ln}{B}_{10}=31.5\\) (8.1σ). Plots of the best-fit HyDRA retrievals with and without each detected molecule are shown in Supplementary Figs. 13–16. We additionally find that a dilution parameter is not statistically justified in either the dayside or nightside retrievals, nor are clouds.', 'We used PETRA to perform free chemistry retrievals for the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectrum, focusing on characterization of the dayside atmosphere only. The chemical species we considered were H2O, CO and SiO. Only the H2O abundance was allowed to be affected by thermal dissociation, following a similar approach to that used in the NEMESIS and HyDRA free chemistry retrievals. The PT profile was modelled with the same five-parameter function used in the ATMO, CHIMERA and HyDRA retrievals. The priors used for each model parameter are listed in Supplementary Table 7. Posterior sampling was performed using differential-evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo136,137.', 'As for all other dayside retrievals, the inferred PT profile exhibits a strong thermal inversion (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, the thermal inversion inferred by PETRA starts at a pressure of ~10−3\u2009bar, which is higher in the atmosphere than the thermal inversions inferred by the other retrievals. For the chemical abundances, we obtain logarithmic VMRs of \\({-2.03}_{-0.36}^{+0.32}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for CO, \\({-3.15}_{-0.28}^{+0.29}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for SiO and \\({-3.92}_{-0.27}^{+0.28}\\,{\\mathrm{dex}}\\) for H2O. We note that the lower edge of the 68% credible interval (16th percentile) for the H2O abundance decreases with increasing pressure for pressures above approximately 10−2\u2009bar. This corresponds to solutions where the thermal dissociation exponent is negative (τ\u2009<\u20090) and indicates that the data are not constraining the H2O abundance for pressures >10−2\u2009bar in the PETRA retrieval.', 'The four retrievals that considered the nɸ\u2009=\u200934 spectrum (ATMO, NEMESIS, HyDRA and PETRA) recover dayside PT profiles with thermal inversions and fit the data with emission features of H2O, CO and SiO. The exact shapes of the inferred PT profiles differ somewhat and appear to be correlated with differences in the inferred pressure-dependent abundances, particularly that of H2O. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, NEMESIS and PETRA favour the dissociation of H2O at pressures <10−3\u2009bar, resulting in thermal inversions at lower pressures than those obtained by ATMO and HyDRA, for which H2O dissociation is found to occur at pressures of ~10−2\u2009bar. These results emphasize how challenging it can be to model pressure-variable abundances with free chemistry retrievals in a purely parametric manner, even when constrained by JWST-quality data. Despite the variation in absolute abundances and thermal inversion pressures, the inferred C/O, C/Si and O/Si ratios are found to be highly consistent across all the retrieval analyses (Supplementary Fig. 17).', 'Each of the retrieval analyses that were performed for the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum (ATMO, NEMESIS, HyDRA and CHIMERA) return nightside PT profiles that cool with decreasing pressure and find evidence for CH4 absorption features. The PT profiles and absolute CH4 abundances are in good overall agreement across the retrievals (Supplementary Fig. 7). The one mild exception is the CHIMERA retrieval that adopted the five-parameter PT profile, which finds a low-pressure inversion that is not seen in the other retrieval analyses. As noted above, because this inversion occurs at low pressures it only has a minor effect on the appearance of the emission spectrum. Otherwise, the CHIMERA five-parameter PT profile broadly resembles those of the other analyses, but shifted to higher pressures. This reflects the relatively low CH4 abundance inferred by CHIMERA for the five-parameter PT profile (Supplementary Fig. 7), which has the effect of moving the photosphere to a higher pressure than for the other retrieval models.', 'In assessing the detection significances for each molecule, we report the corresponding range of values obtained from the various free chemistry retrievals: 5.5–13.5σ for dayside H2O; 10.8–12.8σ for dayside CO; 5.7–6.2σ for dayside SiO; and 3.1–5.1σ for nightside CH4. Within these ranges, we favour those detection significances obtained by the retrieval codes that used the latest line list for the corresponding molecule (Supplementary Table 2). For H2O, HyDRA uses the HITEMP line list of ref.\u200974, which is based on the earlier ab initio line list of ref.\u200972, while both NEMESIS and CHIMERA use the more recent ExoMOL line list of ref.\u200973. For CO, NEMESIS uses the ExoMOL line list of ref.\u200979, while HyDRA and CHIMERA use the earlier HITEMP line list of ref.\u200974. For SiO, HyDRA uses the latest ExoMOL line list of ref.\u200982, which superseded the earlier line list of ref.\u200981 used by NEMESIS. For CH4, CHIMERA uses the recent HITEMP line list of ref.\u200978, whereas NEMESIS and HyDRA use the earlier ExoMOL line lists of refs.\u200975,76,77. On the basis of these line lists, our favoured detection significances are therefore 13.5σ for dayside H2O (NEMESIS), 10.8σ for dayside CO (NEMESIS) and 6.2σ for dayside SiO (HyDRA). For nightside CH4, we favour the detection significance of 4.7σ from the CHIMERA retrieval performed with the five-parameter PT profile, which gave a higher Bayesian evidence (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-190.39\\pm 0.08\\)) than the three-parameter (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-192.72\\pm 0.07\\)) and six-parameter (\\(\\mathrm{ln}{{\\mathcal{Z}}}_{1}=-191.56\\pm 0.06\\)) PT profiles.', 'We note that the lowest detection significance of 3.1σ obtained for nightside CH4 by the HyDRA retrieval may be overly conservative. Higher detection significances of 5.1σ and 4.9σ, respectively, were obtained by the CHIMERA and NEMESIS retrievals for the same six-parameter PT profile adopted by HyDRA. We suspect that the difference in detection significances may be due to HyDRA using the early ExoMOL line lists of refs.\u200975,77 for CH4, whereas NEMESIS uses the expanded ExoMOL line list of ref.\u200976, and CHIMERA uses the more recent HITEMP line list of ref.\u200978, which (unlike the ab initio ExoMOL line lists) is largely based on experimental data. Differences in the adopted H2O line list could also potentially affect the inferred CH4 detection significance, given that H2O and CH4 have broad features at similar wavelengths within the G395H passband. As noted above, NEMESIS and CHIMERA both use the H2O line list of ref.\u200973, which is more recent than the line list of ref.\u200974 used by HyDRA. Indeed, the dayside H2O detection significance obtained by NEMESIS (13.5σ) is considerably higher than that obtained by HyDRA (5.5σ), as would be expected if the H2O line list used by NEMESIS is better suited for the conditions of the WASP-121\u2009b atmosphere than the older line list used by HyDRA. Furthermore, the fact that NEMESIS obtains lower detection significances than HyDRA for the other molecules (that is, CO and SiO on the dayside) demonstrates that NEMESIS does not systematically overestimate detection significances relative to HyDRA.', 'In addition to the formal detection significances, there are several other reasons that we favour nightside models including CH4. First, when CH4 is removed from the free chemistry retrievals (NEMESIS, HyDRA and CHIMERA), a thermal inversion at pressures >10−3\u2009bar is required to reproduce the observed nightside spectrum with emission features of H2O and CO. A thermal inversion this deep in the non-irradiated nightside atmosphere is not expected, on the basis of state-of-the-art GCM simulations (Extended Data Fig. 5). It would also be in tension with HST measurements that have previously revealed a decreasing PT profile on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b12. Second, the inference of an atmospheric \\({\\rm{C}}/{\\rm{O}}={0.92}_{-0.03}^{+0.02}\\) from the dayside spectrum (ATMO) is a robust result (Fig. 3). With an atmospheric C/O ratio this high, equilibrium chemistry predicts a logarithmic VMR above −4\u2009dex for CH4 at the temperatures of the nightside (Extended Data Fig. 4), which is broadly consistent with the abundances inferred by the free chemistry retrievals (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although horizontal quenching of CH4-poor gas from the dayside could in principle dominate the nightside composition, this nonetheless demonstrates that the CH4 abundances we have inferred are physically plausible. We also reiterate that we did allow for dayside contamination of the nɸ\u2009=\u200918 spectrum using two approaches: including a dilution factor as a free parameter (HyDRA and CHIMERA) and by explicitly modelling the dayside contribution (NEMESIS). The evidence for CH4 and a decreasing PT profile on the nightside persists with both of these approaches.', 'We do not make a statistically significant detection of CO on the nightside, despite equilibrium chemistry predicting a CO abundance that is comparable to the CH4 abundance (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 4). This is because the abundance-weighted CO opacity is only higher than that of CH4 within narrow line cores across the ~4–4.5\u2009μm wavelength range. At the spectral resolution of the nightside data, the corresponding opacity enhancement provided by CO over CH4 is quite modest (Extended Data Fig. 3) and we find that the inclusion or exclusion of CO has only a minor effect on the spectrum relative to the measurement uncertainties (Fig. 1). In particular, when we simply switch off the CO opacity in the best-fit ATMO model shown in Fig. 1, the χ2 increases from 370.6 to 372.4, corresponding to a negligible \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}\\) increase from 1.087 to 1.092. Consequently, the nightside CO abundance is only weakly constrained by the free chemistry retrievals, while the CO abundance displayed in Fig. 2 primarily reflects the chemical equilibrium constraint imposed for the ATMO retrieval.', 'We also do not find evidence for clouds on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b, based on the Bayes factor computed from the HyDRA retrievals performed with and without clouds, as well as the lack of cloud constraints obtained by NEMESIS. This is despite the inferred nightside PT profile crossing numerous condensation curves of refractory species (Fig. 2), including silicates, which are expected to be the dominant source of cloud opacity on the hot nightsides of planets like WASP-121\u2009b14. However, as noted in the main text, our non-detection of clouds does not necessarily imply the absence of nightside clouds. In particular, the inferred PT profile for the nightside hemisphere crosses the MgSiO3, Mg2SiO4 and SiO2 condensation curves at pressures of ~1\u2009bar, whereas the data are only sensitive to pressures below ~10−1\u2009bar (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 6). It therefore remains possible that a thick cloud layer composed of silicates and/or other refractory species, such as Fe, is present on the nightside of WASP-121\u2009b at pressures >10−1\u2009bar.', 'We derived photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters for the WASP-121 host star using the algorithm described in ref.\u2009138. For our isochrone fitting, we included multiwavelength photometry from the UV to the near-infrared: Tycho-2 BT and VT139, Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2)140,141,142,143, the G, J, H and Ks bands from the Two Micron All Sky Survey All-Sky Point Source Catalog144 and the W1 and W2 bands from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer AllWISE mid-infrared data145,146. We also included the Gaia DR3143 parallax-based distance to the WASP-121 system147. We included the extinction AV inference based on 3D maps of extinction in the solar neighbourhood from the Structuring by Inversion the Local Interstellar Medium programme148,149,150.', 'For the spectroscopic-based inferences, we used the equivalent widths of Fe\u2009I and Fe\u2009II atomic absorption lines. The equivalent widths were derived from a spectrum of the WASP-121 host star measured with the ESPRESSO instrument on the Very Large Telescope. The spectrum is available from the European Southern Observatory archive under programme ID 106.21QM.001. It was taken on 2021 September 6 and has a signal-to-noise ratio of ~150 at 5,000\u2009Å. To measure the equivalent widths, we used the splot task of IRAF (IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of the Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation). The atomic data and measured equivalent widths for each line are reported in Supplementary Table 8. We adapted the atomic data from ref.\u2009151 and assumed photospheric solar abundances from ref.\u2009152.', 'We used the isochrones package153 to fit the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks154,155,156 library to our photospheric stellar parameters, as well as our input multiwavelength photometry, parallax and extinction data using pymultinest125. Further details of our approach are provided in ref.\u2009138. The adopted stellar parameters are given in Supplementary Table 9.', 'We inferred elemental abundances of C\u2009I, O\u2009I, Na\u2009I, Mg\u2009I, Al\u2009I, Si\u2009I, S\u2009I, K\u2009I, Ca\u2009I, Sc\u2009II, Ti\u2009II, V\u2009I, Cr\u2009I, Cr\u2009II, Mn\u2009I, Fe\u2009I, Fe\u2009II, Co\u2009I, Ni\u2009I, Cu\u2009I, Zn\u2009II, Y\u2009II, Zr\u2009II, Ba\u2009II, Ce\u2009II, Nd\u2009II and Sm\u2009II using the equivalent-width method, including isotopic/hyperfine splitting details where needed. We measured the equivalent widths by fitting Gaussian profiles with the splot task in IRAF. We also used the deblend task to disentangle absorption lines from adjacent spectral features whenever necessary. We assumed the solar abundances of ref.\u2009152 and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and used the 1D plane-parallel solar-composition MARCS model atmospheres157 and the 2019 version of the LTE radiative transfer code MOOG158 to infer elemental abundances based on our equivalent widths. Our abundance inferences and uncertainties are reported in Supplementary Table 10. Where possible, we updated our elemental abundances for departures from LTE by linearly interpolating published grids of non-LTE corrections. Specifically, non-LTE corrections taken from the tables of refs.\u2009159,160,161,162 were applied to the carbon, oxygen, aluminium, calcium, silicon, potassium and iron abundances.', 'We highlight the stellar abundances derived for C\u2009I, O\u2009I and Si\u2009I in particular, with reference to the abundances in the standard A(X) format. Here A(X)\u2009=\u2009logNX/NH\u2009+\u200912, where NX is the number density of species X and NH is the number density of hydrogen.

The non-LTE and LTE abundances are consistent to well within the 1σ uncertainties for both C\u2009I and Si\u2009I. However, the non-LTE abundance for O\u2009I is significantly lower than the LTE abundance. This results in an upward revision of the stellar C/O ratio from 0.203\u2009±\u20090.050 (LTE) to 0.470\u2009±\u20090.061 (non-LTE).

Given that Earth has a mass of 5.9723\u2009×\u20091024\u2009kg, this equates to 9.5557\u2009×\u20091023\u2009kg of silicon in the Earth. Adopting μSi\u2009=\u20090.028\u2009kg\u2009mol−1 for the molar mass of silicon, the total number of silicon atoms in the Earth then works out to be approximately nSi,⊕\u2009=\u20092.06\u2009×\u20091049. Therefore, we estimate that \\({n}_{{\\mathrm{Si}},\\upvarepsilon }/{n}_{{\\mathrm{Si}},\\bigoplus }={21.2}_{-6.6}^{+11.8}\\), implying that the accretion of approximately 15–33\u2009M⊕ of rocky material with an Earth-like composition can explain the silicon enrichment we have measured for the atmosphere of WASP-121\u2009b.', 'As noted above, this calculation assumes that the planetary envelope started out with a silicon enrichment equal to the host star. However, the gas accreted by the planet at formation may have been depleted in silicon, as silicon would have condensed out of the gas phase throughout the protoplanetary disk2,24. If we repeat the above calculation assuming that all of the silicon observed in the atmosphere was acquired through the accretion of rocky material by setting nSi,env/nH,env\u2009=\u2009nSi,ε/nH,env, then we estimate the quantity of accreted rocky material to be \\({n}_{{\\mathrm{Si}},\\upvarepsilon }/{n}_{{\\mathrm{Si}},\\bigoplus }={23.7}_{-6.6}^{+11.8}\\), or approximately 17–36\u2009M⊕.', 'Supplementary Fig. 18 shows the atmospheric transmission spectrum of the day–night terminator region given by the inferred values for Rp as a function of wavelength. The data exhibit a downward slope between 2.75\u2009μm and 4\u2009μm, then increase sharply and peak at around 4.5–4.8\u2009μm, before dropping off again towards longer wavelengths. These wavelength-dependent variations in the transmission spectrum indicate that the data are precise enough to identify key absorbing species at the day–night terminator. Predictions from models published in ref.\u20091 and ref.\u2009167 are also shown in Supplementary Fig. 18, both of which were fitted to optical and near-infrared data obtained with HST. Neither model provides a good fit to the longer-wavelength JWST data. Further analysis of the transmission spectrum will be presented in an accompanying paper168.', 'Wavelength-dependent values for u1 and u2, ΔTmid and Δɸ are also shown in Supplementary Figs. 19–21. We find that the posterior values for u1 and u2 closely match the exoTiC-LD priors. For ΔTmid and Δɸ, we do not see any clear evidence for variations as a function of wavelength that can easily be explained. A flat line fitted to the ΔTmid values gives \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}=1.00\\), as would be expected if there are no wavelength-dependent variations. However, a higher \\({\\chi }_{\\upsilon }^{2}=1.74\\) is obtained when a flat line is fitted to the Δɸ values, indicating possible evidence for wavelength-dependent variations that should be investigated further in future studies.', 'The data used in this paper are associated with JWST programme G.O. 1729 (P.I., T.M.E.-S; co-P.I., K.T) and are publicly available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescope at https://mast.stsci.edu.

Astronomers use the Webb Telescope to study WASP-121b,https://www.techexplorist.com/astronomers-webb-telescope-study-wasp-121b/99636/,"['', '', 'Ultrahot giant planets have atmospheres that contain elements like iron, magnesium, and silicon. Scientists can use these elements to estimate how much solid material these planets gathered during their formation, along with gases and ices. However, detecting both solid and gaseous elements simultaneously is challenging because their unique signals are spread across a wide range of wavelengths.', 'Using the JWST, a team of astronomers offers new clues about the origin of exoplanet WASP-121 b. Scientists using a telescope detected key molecules—water vapor, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane—in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot giant planet WASP-121b. This allowed researchers, including Dr. Joanna Barstow, to measure the levels of carbon, oxygen, and silicon present in the sample.', 'The discovery of methane suggests strong winds on the planet’s cooler nightside, a factor often overlooked in previous models. WASP-121b orbits its star very closely, completing one orbit in about 30.5 hours. Its dayside reaches scorching temperatures of 3000°C, while its nightside is much cooler at 1500°C. Dr. Barstow developed methods to study both temperature extremes simultaneously.', 'Scientists examined how different compounds in WASP-121b’s atmosphere evaporate at varying temperatures, offering insights into how the planet formed and evolved.', 'International team of astronomers observe changing weather patterns on exoplanet', 'Dr. Joanna Barstow developed a model that separates the planet into two distinct regions: a scorching dayside dominated by thermal emissions from carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide and a much cooler nightside, where methane absorption plays a key role. This model accurately fits observations at all phases, confirming that WASP-121b truly has two contrasting faces.', 'Silicon in WASP-121b’s atmosphere was detected as silicon monoxide (SiO) gas, but it originated from rocky material, such as quartz, carried by planetesimals—small asteroid-like objects. Since planetesimals take time to form, this likely happened during the later stages of the planet’s development.', 'Planet formation starts with tiny icy dust particles sticking together to form pebbles. These pebbles attract gas and other particles, growing into larger bodies. As they move inward toward the star, their ices evaporate in the warmer regions of the protoplanetary disc.', 'Young planets can become large enough to create gaps in the disc, stopping the inward movement of pebbles but still gathering gas to build an atmosphere. For WASP-121b, methane pebbles evaporated, enriching its atmosphere with carbon, while water pebbles stayed frozen, trapping oxygen. This led to WASP-121b accumulating mostly carbon-rich gas, shaping the final makeup of its atmosphere.', 'Exotic water cycle and metal clouds discovered on Jupiter exoplanet', 'Scientists expected the amount of molecules like methane and carbon monoxide in WASP-121b’s atmosphere to change with temperature. Since methane becomes unstable at the extremely high temperatures of the planet’s dayside, it was expected to be nearly absent.', 'Because atmospheric gases circulate between the hot dayside and cooler nightside faster than they can adjust to temperature changes, researchers thought methane would also be scarce on the nightside. However, they found an unexpectedly large amount of methane there.', 'To explain this, scientists suggest that strong vertical winds must constantly pull methane up from lower atmospheric layers, where cooler temperatures and a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio help maintain methane abundance.', 'Scientists used the JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) to observe WASP-121b as it completed a full orbit around its star. Because the planet rotates, different parts of its atmosphere receive varying levels of heat, allowing researchers to analyze the conditions and chemical makeup of both its scorching dayside and cooler nightside.', 'They also studied the planet as it passed in front of its star, where some starlight filtered through its atmosphere.

JWST reveals the origin of ultra-hot exoplanet WASP-121b,https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/jwst-reveals-the-origin-of-ultra-hot-exoplanet-wasp-121b/193518/,"['Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have shed light on the formation and origin of the exoplanet WASP-121b. The detection of key molecules, including water vapour, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and methane, suggests the planet formed in a region analogous to the Solar System’s gas and ice giant domain and subsequently migrated to its current, extremely close orbit around its host star.', 'A team of astronomers, led by Thomas Evans-Soma and Cyril Gapp, analysed the atmospheric composition of WASP-121b using JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). The presence of water vapour, carbon monoxide, silicon monoxide, and, notably, methane, allowed them to determine the abundance of carbon, oxygen, and silicon. The detection of methane also indicates strong vertical winds on the planet’s cooler nightside, a phenomenon often overlooked in current exoplanet models.', 'According to Evans-Soma, dayside temperatures are so high that typically solid compounds can exist as gaseous components of the planet’s atmosphere. This makes WASP-121b a unique laboratory for studying planetary atmospheres.', 'WASP-121b is an ultra-hot gas giant orbiting its star at a distance only twice the star’s diameter, completing an orbit in just 30.5 hours. This proximity results in extreme temperature differences between its hemispheres: the dayside reaches over 3000 degrees Celsius, while the nightside cools to 1500 degrees Celsius.', 'By analysing the abundance of compounds that evaporate at different temperatures, the team inferred that WASP-121b likely formed in a region cold enough for water to freeze but warm enough for methane to exist as a gas.', 'In our Solar System, this zone lies between the orbits of Jupiter and Uranus. This suggests that WASP-121b formed far from its current location and later migrated inward.', 'The presence of silicon monoxide (SiO) indicates that the planet incorporated rocky material, like quartz from asteroids, later in its development. Planet formation begins with icy dust particles that grow into pebbles, attracting gas and smaller particles. These pebbles migrate inward, and their ices evaporate in the warmer regions. When a planet grows large enough, it can create gaps in the protoplanetary disc, halting the inward drift of pebbles.', 'In the case of WASP-121b, the planet appears to have formed where methane pebbles evaporated, enriching the surrounding gas with carbon, while water remained frozen. This explains the higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio observed in the planet’s atmosphere compared to its host star.', 'The detection of methane on WASP-121b’s nightside was unexpected. At the planet’s high temperatures, methane should be unstable. The team proposes that strong vertical currents rapidly replenish methane from lower atmospheric layers, which are rich in methane due to the cooler temperatures and high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. This finding challenges existing exoplanet models and suggests the need for revisions to account for strong vertical mixing.', 'JWST’s NIRSpec instrument allowed the team to observe exoplanet WASP-121b throughout its orbit, characterising the conditions and chemical composition of both its dayside and nightside.

Silicon monoxide – clouds of vaporized rock. Using JWST, a team of astronomers identified the molecule in the exoplanet's atmosphere, in addition to water, carbon monoxide, and methane."", '""The relative abundances of carbon, oxygen, and silicon offer insights into how this planet formed and acquired its material,"" explains astronomer Thomas Evans-Soma of the University of Newcastle in Australia, who led the research.', ""Tylos is around 1.75 times the radius but only 1.16 times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting a yellow-white star named Dilmun that's 1.5 times the radius of the Sun, on a breakneck orbit of just 30 hours. It's so close to the star that it's literally evaporating, its atmosphere puffed up by the intense heat."", ""As it whips around Dilmun, Tylos passes between us and it, which means it's in the perfect configuration for study. Some of the star's light passes through the exoplanet's puffy atmosphere and becomes altered by the molecules therein as it goes. Astronomers can painstakingly study these tiny signals to figure out which molecules are responsible for the alterations."", ""Tylos is what is known as a hot Jupiter – gas giant worlds in bogglingly close proximities to their host stars. They're something of an open question: they can't form in those close orbits, because the radiation and winds from the star would stop the gas from accumulating. The leading explanation is that they form farther away and migrate inwards."", ""The first detection of silicon monoxide in an exoplanet's atmosphere was described in a paper published in 2022. It's a very difficult and rare molecule to detect. But it's the combination of molecules in the atmosphere of Tylos that helped Evans-Soma and his team figure out the exoplanet's birthplace."", ""Stars are born from dense clouds of molecular gas. As they spin, material arranges itself in a disk that spools into and feeds the growing star. Once the star is powerful enough to push away the material with its winds, its growth is cut off, and the material that's left in the disk clumps in small pebbles of dust and ice that stick together and grow to form planets."", 'At closer proximities to the host star, ice sublimates into gas. This is known as the ice line or the snow line, and different ices have different sublimation points.', 'Studying the ratios of the molecules in the atmosphere of Tylos, the researchers concluded that the exoplanet formed at a distance from its star where methane was in its vapor form, but water ice remained frozen.', ""In the Solar System, that distance is out between the orbits of Jupiter and Uranus. Dilmun is hotter than our Sun, so the distance would be even greater for Tylos – suggesting that it had to migrate a long way to get to its current position. It's also some of the best evidence yet for how hot Jupiters form and evolve."", ""But there's another mystery. The methane was detected on the exoplanet's nightside, which faces permanently away from Dilmun. Methane is unstable at high temperatures, and would be undetectable on the scorching dayside. As it moves around into the nightside, it's expected to remain undetectable at the same altitude."", ""The plentiful abundance, therefore, of methane high in the nightside atmosphere of Tylos suggests some interesting atmospheric processes going on. The researchers think it's vertical mixing – strong updrafts carrying methane from deep in the atmosphere to the upper atmosphere, where it can be detected by JWST."", '""This challenges exoplanet dynamical models, which will likely need to be adapted to reproduce the strong vertical mixing we\'ve uncovered on the nightside,"" Evans-Soma says.', ""Although we've peered at Tylos more than most of the nearly 6,000 exoplanets confirmed to date, the strange, melting world still has a lot to teach us about planets in the Milky Way."", 'The research has been published in Nature Astronomy.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVFXVXBUTW5nMVdrOVdPVXBZVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdrQm80cE9PYVc0RXdF=-w280-h168-p-df

Consequently, the planet captured carbon-rich, oxygen-poor gas, accounting for its higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio than its host star.', 'Methane shouldn’t survive at the high temperatures of WASP-121b’s dayside. It breaks down quickly under such heat.', 'Scientists expected the same for the nightside, where, despite cooler temperatures, gas circulation from the dayside would typically prevent methane from accumulating.', 'However, they found abundant methane on the nightside, which came as a surprise. To explain this, the researchers propose that strong vertical currents are rapidly lifting methane from deeper, cooler atmospheric layers.', '“This challenges exoplanet dynamical models, which will likely need to be adapted to reproduce the strong vertical mixing we’ve uncovered on the nightside of WASP-121b,” said Evans-Soma.', 'This discovery highlights the need to rethink how scientists model atmospheric behavior on extreme planets.', 'Astronomers made the observations using JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec). The team monitored WASP-121b over its entire orbit, capturing how the heat signature of the planet changed as different parts of its atmosphere rotated into view.', 'The experts also gathered data during the planet’s transit in front of its star. During this transit, some starlight passed through the planet’s atmosphere, leaving distinct spectral signatures.', '“The emerging transmission spectrum confirmed the detections of silicon monoxide, carbon monoxide, and water that were made with the emission data,” Gapp explained. “However, we could not find methane in the transition zone between the day and nightside.”', 'The absence of methane in the transition zone further supports the idea that vertical mixing is confined to the nightside, a detail that current models fail to predict.', 'The full study was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.', 'Image Credit: T.

Astronomers looking through the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have cracked the chemical narrative of WASP-121b, a hot gas planet with two opposing extremes. The world orbits its star with such proximity that it takes 30.5 hours to finish a cycle, scorching one side and freezing the other.', ""JWST's high-resolution image discovered water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide churning around in its atmosphere. These gases provided scientists with hints about the planet's early days. Scientists created a map of carbon, oxygen and silicon levels in WASP-121b's atmosphere based on this data.
