""That\'s kind of [what] most people have talked about. Not much detail on why. Just it\'s long and the rough is impossible, and you can end up hitting 50-yard pitches trying to get up and down for par on every hole, something of that nature.""', ""It's the 10th time Oakmont is hosting the U.S. Open, and there's a reason the United States Golf Association keeps going back -- to give golfers their most difficult test of the season."", '""I would say all of the rumors and everything are pretty on point,"" added Justin Thomas, who played a practice round at Oakmont two weeks ago.', ""Here's a look at the field, including the contenders, sleepers, qualifiers and amateurs:"", '', 'Jump to a section:\nThe clear favorite | Guys who can win | If everything goes right\nMiracles happen | Happy to make the cut | Qualifiers | Amateurs', ""It's Scottie Scheffler's world once again in men's professional golf, and everyone else just seems to be witnessing what he'll do next. After capturing last month's PGA Championship to go with his two Masters victories, Scheffler can complete three-fourths of the career Grand Slam with a victory on Sunday."", '', 'Scottie Scheffler', ""Yeah, forget about Scheffler being off to a slow start. The world No. 1 golfer heads to Oakmont Country Club on another epic heater, having won in three of his past four starts (by a whopping 17 strokes combined!), including his 16th PGA Tour victory at the Memorial Tournament. He's turning into Mariano Rivera during the second nine on Sunday, converting each of his past seven 54-hole leads."", ""He has fond memories of Oakmont; he carded a 1-under 69 in his first round in a major in the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont as a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Texas. He missed the cut by one stroke after posting an 8-over 78 in the second round. If he's accurate off the tee, he'll be difficult to beat."", '', 'Here are the legitimate contenders to win the U.S. Open. They have the game, guts and nerves to handle four pressure-packed rounds on a setup that is traditionally the most difficult among the majors.', 'Bryson DeChambeau', ""DeChambeau captured his second U.S. Open title at Pinehurst, despite missing nearly half the fairways (57%) over four rounds. He won by outdriving everyone else (310.9-yard average), hitting greens and putting lights-out. He'll have to be more accurate off the tee at Oakmont, and he wasn't happy with his iron play at the Masters and PGA Championship. Still, he has finished tied for sixth or better in five of the past six majors."", 'Rory McIlroy', ""Rory will try to exorcise his demons from last year's U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, where he squandered a 2-stroke lead with five holes to play and missed short putts on Nos. 16 and 18. He lost to DeChambeau by 1 shot. McIlroy missed the cut in his only start at Oakmont nine years ago. He doesn't seem to have much confidence off the tee right now; he missed the cut at last week's RBC Canadian Open after hitting only 13 of 28 fairways in two rounds. McIlroy planned on testing several new drivers over the weekend to find one he likes."", 'Collin Morikawa', ""The two-time major champion is a two-time runner-up this season, at the season-opening Sentry and the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Morikawa hasn't won in more than 19 months; his last victory on tour came at the Zozo Championship in Japan in October 2023. That drought has to end sometime soon. He's extremely accurate off the tee (72.9%) and is a world-class ball striker (67.6% greens in regulation)."", 'Jon Rahm', 'The LIV Golf League star got himself into the mix against Scheffler on the second nine of the final round of the PGA Championship but collapsed down the stretch. Rahm, who won the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, finished in a tie for 12th or better in four of his past five starts in the tournament. He was wildly inaccurate off the tee at Quail Hollow, which would spell disaster for him this week.', 'Russell Henley', ""Henley collected his fifth PGA Tour victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and followed that with a tie for eighth at the RBC Heritage and for fifth at the Memorial. He tied for seventh in the 2024 U.S. Open at 1 under. Henley ranks 16th on tour in strokes gained: approach (.538) and 11th around the green (.393). He's tied for 12th in driving accuracy (67.7%), which will help at Oakmont, too."", 'Sepp Straka', ""Straka is one of the more underrated golfers on tour, having already won twice this season at the American Express and Truist Championship. He also has piled up five top-10s and 11 top-25s in 13 starts, all but securing his spot on the European Ryder Cup team. He'll look for a better showing this week after missing the cut at the Masters and PGA Championship. He doesn't miss fairways (68.5% fairways hit), leads the tour in greens in regulation (71.4%) and is 17th in strokes gained: putting (.427)."", 'Xander Schauffele', ""Schauffele's putter seems to be warming up, which was about the only thing holding him back since his return from a rib injury.

Still, his game seems tailor-made to win a U.S. Open.', 'Hideki Matsuyama', 'The 2019 Masters champion missed the cut at the PGA Championship, which ended his streak of playing on the weekend at 19 straight majors.

He's still an exceptional iron player and hits enough fairways, but will his short game and putting hold up on Oakmont's diabolical green structures?"", 'Aaron Rai', ""If keeping the ball in the fairway is a prerequisite for contending at Oakmont, no one on tour does it better than Rai, who leads in driving accuracy (73.4%). He'll have to do a better job on the greens, too."", 'Tyrrell Hatton', ""USGA setups don't seem to fit Hatton's eye. He finished in the top 10 only once, tying for sixth in 2018 at Shinnecock Hills in Long Island, New York. He has played like one of the best golfers in the world for a while now."", 'Corey Conners', 'The Canadian golfer hits most fairways (68.8%) and greens (70%) and is putting better this season. He tied for ninth at Pinehurst last season.', 'Ben Griffin', ""It's hard to believe that the former North Carolina star was working as a mortgage loan officer four years ago and nearly walked away from the sport. Griffin and Andrew Novak captured the team event in New Orleans, and then Griffin picked up his first individual title at the Charles Schwab Challenge.

Gil Hanse Talks Oakmont Renovation Ahead of 125th U.S. Open,https://www.usopen.com/2025/articles/gil-hanse-oakmont-renovation-125th-us-open.html,"['U.S. OPEN', '', 'By David Shefter, USGA', 'The 2023 renovation of Oakmont C.C. ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open was just the latest major project for architect Gil Hanse. (USGA/Don Liebig)', '', '', 'Gil Hanse hasn’t officially been given the nickname “Open Doctor” – in fact, he shies away from such acknowledgement – like his predecessor Rees Jones, but the Philadelphia-based architect certainly has gained a reputation for his restorations/renovations of some of golf’s greatest championship venues. Hanse’s work includes Winged Foot Golf Club (2020 U.S. Open) The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. (2022 U.S. Open), The Los Angeles Country Club (2023 U.S. Open), past/future U.S. Open sites Oakland Hills Country Club and Merion Golf Club, past U.S. Open sites Baltusrol Golf Club, The Olympic Club and Southern Hills Country Club, past U.S. Women’s Open site Plainfield C.C. and past U.S. Amateur site Ridgewood Country Club. Two years ago, Hanse completed a restoration of Oakmont Country Club outside of Pittsburgh, Pa., which will host the U.S. Open for a record 10th time in June. USGA Senior Staff writer David Shefter talked to Hanse about his work at Oakmont in preparation for the 125th U.S. Open. ', 'Question: How long did it take to complete the project?', 'Hanse: We started the project in March of 2023, and it was completed by Halloween. We did it in sections. We closed the front nine in the spring and reopened all 18 by early summer. We closed the back nine on Labor Day and finished by the end of October.  ', 'Question: Oakmont is considered one of the “cathedrals” in golf, and some believe it is the greatest U.S. Open test. So, when you’re asked to do a restoration at such a championship venue, how do you go about developing your game plan?', 'Hanse: It was very different than any other restoration plan that we’ve done because the Fownes family (specifically Henry and his son William) was so prevalent in the founding and creation of Oakmont [in 1904]. But they also were the architects and were actively involved in altering the golf course over a 40-year period. So, it wasn’t like [A.W.] Tillinghast who built a golf course in 1924 and that’s pretty much what it was. They literally changed the golf course every year.', 'What we decided to do was look through all the archives for the period that either Henry or William Fownes were alive and actively involved in the club. Look at the first hole. In our opinion for the modern game, the 1927 iteration was the best version. And then maybe the 1935 iteration was the best version for the second hole. The Fownes family was always involved in whatever the design revisions were, so we spanned the entire history of their involvement to come up with different ideas. So, it’s a little bit of an eclectic design as opposed to going back to a certain point in time.', 'The Fownes’ were good players, and they were adamant to protect that golf course, and like I’ve said before, it is unapologetically difficult, and that is what they wanted.', 'Queston: When you are tasked with restoring/renovating a layout such as Oakmont, are you almost afraid to touch it? Is it kind of like asking an artist to upgrade the Mona Lisa or the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?', 'Hanse: With the research and the thorough study, I think we come into it with a certain confidence. Yeah, there’s always an excited nervousness because … it’s one of the [game’s] cathedrals. But you understand that the game has evolved, and that golf course has evolved dramatically, so it’s not like we are the first ones to ever put our fingers on it. Armed with the confidence of the research and with the knowledge that it has evolved more than any other championship golf course, we felt okay with making some significant recommendations, which are all historically based.', ""Gil Hanse's renovation of Oakmont C.C. included restoring green complexes and bunkers, and widening a couple of fairways to insure the venue remained one of the most challenging in golf. (USGA/John Mummert)"", 'Question: When players arrive on site, what will be the biggest thing they notice about the changes since the U.S. Open was last contested at Oakmont in 2016?', 'Hanse: There’s only going to be about a dozen of them [or more] who played in 2016. The turnover is frightening when you think [it’s only been nine years]. The green expansions. There’s going to be a lot of new hole locations. The edges of the greens now are more like tabletops as opposed to having build-up along the edges. I think they are going to feel a little bit more difficult to hit into. We’ve managed to find a little bit more length (approximately 250 yards), so I think they’re going to feel that as well.', 'Question: Of the green expansions/restorations that you did, what are some of the more noticeable changes?', 'Hanse: [The green on] No. 2 has always been a tricky one to find hole locations. We’ve expanded it to restore some hole locations. No. 3. The removal of the front-left bunker … and just the way that green sits up on that hill. It’s more daunting to look at, and the new hole locations on the front-left will be very challenging. And 13 (182-yard par-3) is definitely the biggest change on the golf course. It’s different than any other green out there. It’s got so much contour in it and so many different pockets, which I think is appropriate being it’s the shortest par 3. The premium on accuracy there will be very high.', 'Question: Why was No. 13 one of the biggest changes? Did you enlarge the green? Did you alter the bunkering?', 'Hanse: It’s the ridge that cuts into the green from the right-hand side. Sort of back middle. And that plays into the new back hole location that plays over this ridge. If you get out of position on this green, there’s some real interesting putts that you might have to hit, which they all were. But the character in them [now] is quite interesting.', 'Question: Is it just a matter of time that greens begin to erode and start to shrink?', 'Hanse: That and the sand build-up from the bunkers. If you look at any of the photographs from 2016, the edges of the greens were almost all bowled up. So, they were retaining shots. Shots were staying on greens that if you look at the old, original photographs, those balls were rolling into bunkers. By eliminating those flare-ups on the edge, we’ve expanded the ability to put hole locations, and we’ve also made the bunkers more in play.', 'Architect Gil Hanse continues to make a major impact in golf with his restorations/renovations of historic U.S. Open venues. (USGA/Jason E. Miczek)', 'Question: Speaking of bunkers, you and your team did a lot of work on them at Oakmont. Was it more for drainage and aesthetics? Was it to make the course more challenging or a combination of both?', 'Hanse: Mostly for a practical standpoint. They hadn’t been rebuilt since before the 2007 [U.S. Open]. It was time. Drainage was failing. Sand was old. Then when we knew we had to get in there from a practical standpoint, it became a matter of how we make them stylistically better.', 'Question: Even the famous Church Pew Bunker between Nos. 3 and 4 was not immune to the project, correct?', 'Hanse: Both ends. Just again trying to get them more in play [to combat distance] for tee shots on 3 and 4…I think it was one or two pews on each end, so probably like 10-15 yards.', 'Question: Is that one of your biggest challenges as a modern-day architect? To combat the prodigious distances from the elite professional/amateur golfers?', 'Hanse: We can address it to some degree by adding tees. But where you can’t go back, you need to adjust the bunkers, the [penalty areas] to put them more in play.', 'Question: A few of the fairways were also widened in spots to create more strategy and options off the tee. What holes were affected?', 'Hanse: No. 2 for sure. No. 7, the tee shot is back to an [older] version of the hole. It’s much more strategic, but definitely wider. What we’re trying to do is look at the overall strategy of the golf course and provide different options … but also recognizing that it’s a members’ golf course and we want to make sure for the shorter-hitting members, there’s an opportunity for it to be a little bit wider. If they want to hit it a little shorter off the tee, they are going to have more room.', 'Question: But at Oakmont, the members are not bashful about their love of such a tough layout, correct?', 'Hanse: They are very proud of that. I think there and Winged Foot are the two places they feel like every day they set it up to host a U.S. Open.', 'Question: All these great courses that you have renovated/restored, is it a thrill to have the opportunity to make these championship layouts even greater?', 'Hanse: There are definitely pinch-me moments when you walk out there. It’s really amazing. I use the word a lot, but it’s great to be entrusted with being the stewards and helping to restore. It’s a big responsibility and one that we don’t take lightly, but it’s one where we feel comfortable in that role.', 'Question: Is there any internal pressure each time you get contracted to work on these classic gems?', 'Hanse: Obviously, these clubs have been very, very successful through the years and the membership understands and appreciates it. When the players come, they are vocal. They definitely have opinions, so you definitely want to cover that base as well.', 'Question: What kind of feedback have you received from the Oakmont hierarchy?', 'Hanse: Overwhelmingly positive. The directive when we left the Town Hall meeting when we presented the plan was: “It better not be easier when you’re done,” which is different. That obviously shows you the DNA of the club. And what I hear is it’s not easier.', 'Question: Such a daunting project requires great teamwork. Who were the key people who assisted?', 'Hanse: We had a great contractor. The two guys working with me on site were Kye Goalby (son of 1968 Masters champion Bob Goalby) and Matt Smallwood. They were terrific. Kevin Murphy from our office was great. Great contractors (Total Turf) from an irrigation standpoint and a golf course standpoint. Mike [McCormick], the superintendent, is a rock star. The Oakmont crew really helped a lot. When you have everyone pulling in the same direction together, it can come together that quickly. It had to be really well thought out and well-planned. Mother Nature cooperated, which is always the big unknown.', 'More From the 125th U.S. Open', 'Apr 17, 2025', 'Jun 05, 2025', 'Jun 03, 2025', 'Previous', 'Jun 05, 2025', 'Next', '19 hrs ago', 'USGA Partners', '', '', 'FOLLOW US', '© 2023 United States Golf Association.

"2025 U.S. Open picks, odds, field: Surprising predictions from top-rated golf model that nailed 15 majors",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-u-s-open-picks-odds-field-surprising-predictions-from-top-rated-golf-model-that-nailed-15-majors/,"['', ""The anticipation for the 2025 U.S. Open is ramping into high gear as the third major of the year inches closer. The U.S. Open 2025 begins on Thursday, June 12, and will be played at Oakmont Country Club for the 10th time in its history. Bryson DeChambeau is the defending champion and will look to become the first golfer since Brooks Koepka (2017-18) to successfully defend his title. Should DeChambeau be included in your 2025 U.S. Open bets, or should you look elsewhere on the PGA odds board for value? The latest 2025 U.S. Open odds list Scottie Scheffler (+280), DeChambeau (+700), and Rory McIlroy (+550) as the top three 2025 U.S. Open favorites. They're followed by Jon Rahm (+1200), Xander Schauffele (+1700) and Ludvig Aberg (+1800). Before locking in your 2025 U.S. Open picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine."", ""SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament."", 'This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters - its fourth Masters in a row - and the 2025 PGA Championship.

', 'Now that the 2025 U.S. Open field is taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.', 'One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2025 U.S. Open: Rory McIlroy, a past U.S. Open champion and the third-favorite at +1100, stumbles and falls all the way out of the top five. McIlroy was the talk of the golf world in April when he won the Masters, finally breaking through to complete his career grand slam.', ""There hasn't been much to like about his game since that point, however. He and Shane Lowry finished T12 at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans the next week despite being substantial favorites. McIlroy then finished T7 at the Truist Championship, T47 at the PGA Championship and then missed the cut at last week's RBC Canadian Open. He's not a strong pick to win it all at this number, and there are far better values in the 2025 U.S. Open field. See who else to fade here.  "", ""Another surprise: Collin Morikawa, a 22-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. Morikawa is a two-time major champion, so he knows what it takes to win on golf's biggest stage. The 28-year-old also has two runner-up finishes this season and secured a top-15 finish at the U.S. Open in 2024. Morikawa's game should benefit from the tough conditions expected at Oakmont. He enters the third major of the year ranked second in driving accuracy (72.87%), sixth in strokes gained: approach to green (0.710) and fifth in putting average (1.698). With seven top-five finishes in 22 career major starts, the model expects Morikawa to make another serious run at the leaderboard when he tees it up at Oakmont. See who else to pick here.

"U.S. Open power rankings: Every player at Oakmont ranked, Nos. 1-156",https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/u-s-open-power-rankings-every-player-at-oakmont-ranked-nos-1-156,"['Treacherous, lightning-fast greens.', 'Deep, juicy rough.', 'A brilliant design.', 'There’s no doubt about it: Oakmont is going to be a beast.', 'The best players in the world will take on the Henry C. Fownes masterpiece for this week’s U.S. Open. It’s the 10th time Oakmont has hosted this national championship – and the first time since 2016, when Dustin Johnson took advantage of Shane Lowry’s Sunday misfortune to win his first of what is now two major titles.', 'If there’s ever a course to test every club in the bag, it’s Oakmont, a par-70 layout that will tip out at 7,372 yards and features poa greens, bent and poa fairways and Kentucky bluegrass rough.', '“The Fownes’ were good players, and they were adamant to protect that golf course,” said Gil Hanse, who led the 2023 renovation of the course. ""... It is unapologetically difficult, and that is what they wanted.”', 'The most noticeable changes from 2016 will be larger greens with more hole locations and more penal edges, some additional fairway width in spots to encourage more options, rebuilt bunkers that could see more balls end up closer to lips, and even a bigger church-pew bunker between Nos. 3 and 4 (about 15 yards).', 'And what about the trend from the 2021 U.S. Amateur, where players were driving it into adjacent fairways for better angles? About 5 inches of rough should deter most of that, along with added length on No. 11 and a later start to the 11th fairway, which will make it tough to avoid the rough if hitting it left off No. 10.', 'Statistically, it’s hard to go wrong with total strokes gained. But diving deeper into the metrics, look for players who hit fairways (length shouldn’t be a prerequisite, though if you’re long and straight, you’ll do well anywhere), are strong approach players, scramble well and have good speed on the greens (approach putting). Guys also always have a ton of meaningful putts, usually for par or worse, between 4-8 feet at U.S. Opens. My model also uses a fair bit of gut feelings, too.', 'Scottie Scheffler will be the pre-championship favorite for good reason, but what about everyone else? Let’s rank them all:', '1. Scottie Scheffler: Has collected three trophies in his last four starts. Leads Tour in strokes gained off the tee, strokes gained approach, proximity and bogey avoidance. He’s also third in rough proximity.', '2. Jon Rahm: Starting to get his major groove back – T-14 at Masters, T-8 at PGA. Should be considered among the three or four best in the world off the tee, plus arguably one of the best short games as well.', '3. Bryson DeChambeau: Even with frustrating iron play of late, he’s managed some great results, including a T-5 at the Masters and co-runner-up at the PGA. I could see some dialed-back version of the bomb-and-gauge style that he employed at Winged Foot working at Oakmont.', '4. Keegan Bradley: Hear me out on this one! He’s essentially top 20 in several important metrics, including 17th in total driving, 12th in strokes gained approach and fourth in approach putt performance. And he’s riding back-to-back top-10s.', '5. Si Woo Kim: Another name that popped insanely high on my model. Great at finding fairways and an elite short game. Plus, he was recently T-8 at the PGA.', '6. Collin Morikawa: Second on Tour in driving accuracy with a top-10 approach game. He’s built to win this championship. I just wish he had some better finishes coming into this week.', '7. Sepp Straka: Another great fit for Oakmont as he’s top 3 in strokes gained approach and proximity, and top 6 in rough avoidance off the tee and bogey avoidance. The MC at Quail was an anomaly, as he sandwiched that with a win at Truist and solo third at Memorial.', '8. Corey Conners: He’s cracked the top 25 in 10 of his last 19 major starts. Nothing better than T-6, but with his ball-striking and his surprisingly decent speed on the greens, Conners could challenge that this week.', '9. Joaquin Niemann: Also T-8 at Quail, his first-ever top-10 in a major championship. That could be just what the LIV star needs to kick the door down at Oakmont.', '10. Jordan Spieth: He’s just outside the top 70 in strokes gained approach, but he’s basically top 30 in the other key areas. He’s also No. 1 in approach putting and is coming off a top-10 at the Memorial.', '', 'Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images', '', '11. Shane Lowry: Ranks third in strokes gained approach and proximity, and he should be able to give himself lots of looks from the fairway. He’d be ranked higher on this list if he wasn’t prone to the odd blow-up here and there. And remember his final-round 76 in 2016?', '12. Daniel Berger: Top 15 in total driving and proximity. Would be top 10 on this list if not for back-to-back missed cuts.', '13. Rory McIlroy: Somewhat controversial leaving Rory outside the top 10, but I’m just not feeling the attitude lately. Yes, he and Scottie are far and away the best drivers of the golf ball on Tour, but remember, this is a new driver in the bag, and McIlroy also isn’t hitting it particularly close with the irons this year. I’d go with the other big names before McIlroy this week. (I wrote this before his missed cut by miles in Canada, so this may be validated now.)', '14. Patrick Cantlay: Top 10 in strokes gained approach and approach putting, and he’s nearly top 30 off the tee. This is his major, too, as he has four straight top-15s, including a T-3 last year at Pinehurst.', '15. Xander Schauffele: He’s had plenty of rounds to get the stats up, and we’re still seeing him ranked outside the top 120 in strokes gained off the tee. Schauffele excels on these impossible setups, so we can’t drop him too far.', '16. Robert MacIntyre: Top 25 in strokes gained off the tee and approach, plus he’s really reliable on those 4- to 8-footers that everyone will have for par. Also just hasn’t played bad in a long time.', '17. Justin Thomas: Top 10 in strokes gained approach and one of the best iron players out of the rough, too. Always like JT to embrace these classic setups – he was nearly top 30 here back in 2016. I’m just concerned about the driving – outside the top 90 in strokes gained off the tee – plus he’s kind of cooled off in recent starts.', '18. Bud Cauley: The first final qualifier on the list. Top 10 in total strokes gained this season with the ball-striking a huge reason for that.', '19. Patrick Reed: Hard to measure strokes gained toughness, but Reed is one of the best in that category. Third at the Masters before missing the PGA cut, but he’s made seven straight U.S. Open cuts with four top-20s during that streak.', '20. Tommy Fleetwood: Sneakily ranks sixth in total strokes gained this year. And he’s finished outside the top 25 just twice in his past 22 starts. That’s insane.', '', 'Raymond Carlin III-Imagn Images', '', '21. Russell Henley: He’s really let us down in the majors with MCs at both this year. His lack of length shouldn’t be as big a deal at Oakmont, and we love that his top 12 in driving accuracy and second in proximity.', '22. Harris English: Has top-12s in three of his last four starts, including a T-2 at the PGA. Also has three top-10s in his last five U.S. Open appearances.', '23. J.J. Spaun: We’ve rolled with him in each of the year’s first two majors, and he’s done OK. Top 20 in total driving and fifth in strokes gained approach has him high in the model, but he gets bumped down a little until he proves it more in majors.', '24. Chris Gotterup: Another qualifier. Hits it forever but struggles to find fairways, so this is risky. But he’s also top 10 in bogey avoidance and he’s posted five top-20s in his last seven starts.', '25. Ben Griffin: He’s in elite form right now, just nothing statistically jumps out to say he’ll contend in a U.S. Open, especially his debut.', '26. Aaron Rai: No has hit more fairways or at a higher percentage. And though he’s missed two straight cuts, he’s been solid in the major this year – T-27 at Masters, T-19 at PGA.', '27. Tyrrell Hatton: Scrambling and finding fairways have kept Hatton right around the top 25 in recent U.S. Opens. That’s probably where he ends up again.', '28. Taylor Pendrith: Pendy has been hot since his T-5 at Quail. He’s fifth in total driving and nearly top 30 in strokes gained approach.', '29. Tony Finau: Trending similarly to last year when he was T-3 at Pinehurst. He’s turned around the iron play and his short game has been a real weapon, too. Plus, we know he can send it.', '30. Brooks Koepka: Just waiting for Major Brooks to return. It’s been a while – no top-20s since the 2023 U.S. Open. He’s just not putting well.', '', 'Dan Hamilton-Imagn Images', '', '31. Carlos Ortiz: A win and a couple other top-10s in his last four LIV starts. He’s kind of like LIV Spieth with a worse short game.', '32. Sungjae Im: Top 8 in both driving accuracy and strokes gained around the green. The big concern is he’s missed three straight U.S. Open cuts.', '33. Viktor Hovland: Top 10 in strokes gained approach and nearly top 30 in total driving should have him higher, but the short game and putting speed continue to hamper him.', '34. Ludvig Aberg: Was T-12 in his U.S. Open debut last year, but he’s still ranked outside the top 115 in strokes gained approach. Still, top 25 in total driving and top 15 in proximity, so a top-20 isn’t a terrible bet.', '35. Michael Kim: He’s cooled bit, and it’s been because of a combination of different things. But Top 20 in strokes gained around the green and bogey avoidance, and I’ve always thought his game set up well for these classic U.S. Open tests.', '36. Gary Woodland: He’s not been better than T-49 in his last eight major starts, but top 25 in total driving and proximity. The rough won’t bother him.', '37. Maverick McNealy: A good bet to lead the field in strokes gained putting this week. Just needs to hit more fairways and scramble better.', '38. Hideki Matsuyama: Might be the lowest I’ve ever ranked Hideki. A couple top-6s in his last three U.S. Open starts, and though I love his short game, he’s just not striking it well right now.', '39. Sam Burns: Has four top-20s in his last five starts, and he’s rolling his rock right now. Different grasses at Oakmont, sure, but Burns’ T-9 last year at Pinehurst was promising. I just need to see it more.', '40. Nick Taylor: He’s missed nine of his last 10 major cuts. Gulp. But he’s top 20 in a bunch of stats – driving accuracy, strokes gained approach, bogey avoidance. Get him on a course where distance isn’t necessarily king, and I like him here.', '', 'Raymond Carlin III-Imagn Images', '', '41. Min Woo Lee: He’s simmered since winning in Houston. But there’s a lot to like if he can hit fairways. Granted, that’s a big if.', '42. Ryan Gerard: Ranks 20th in total strokes gained – and that’s with a putter that’s been frustrating over recent months. T-8 at PGA should give him some major confidence, too.', '43. Erik van Rooyen: Sixth in total driving, though he must hit his irons better than he did at Quail. Three straight MCs at the U.S. Open, but he was T-23 at Winged Foot in 2020.', '44. Thorbjorn Olesen: Doing everything above average right now, which explains why he’s 13th in total strokes gained. His play in Canada gives me extra confidence. I’d rank him higher if his major record was better.', '45. Emiliano Grillo: The iron game has really flashed of late as he’s posted four top-25s in his last six starts. Could another Argentine contend at Oakmont?', '46. Brian Harman: Since his T-2 at the 2017 U.S. Open, he’s not missed a cut at this championship.', '47. Akshay Bhatia: Top 25 in strokes gained approach and proximity, though outside the top 125 in total driving. Some of that is distance related. Also, his short game has been uncharacteristically poor of late. But he was T-16 at Pinehurst last year, and if he figures it out, has the game to win one of these someday.', '48. Cameron Smith: Not the same guy who posted five top-10s, including a win, in a nine-major span a few years ago. Has missed three straight major cuts as he just doesn’t drive it well enough to contend.', '49. Andrew Novak: Breakout year, and he’s done most of his work on the better designed courses on the Tour rota. Good short game and speed on the greens. He’ll make his first major cut this week.', '50. Brian Campbell: He will rank last in the field in driving distance, but not many will find more fairways and display a better short game.', '', 'Jim Dedmon-Imagn Images', '', '51. Adam Scott\n52.

"2025 U.S. Open Bettors’ Roundtable: Favorites, Sleepers, Props and Best Bets for Oakmont",https://www.si.com/golf/2025-us-open-bettors-roundtable-favorites-sleepers-props-and-best-bets-oakmont,"['The U.S. Open is set for one of the most revered venues in all of golf: Oakmont. Here to break it down we have once again convened a panel of Sports Illustrated golf writers and editors: Bob Harig, John Schwarb, Max Schreiber and Jeff Ritter, along with Iain MacMillan, Cody Williams and Brian Giuffra, three betting experts from our partners at SI Betting and FanSided. On to the Open.', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf:  Yes. It’s difficult to envision a scenario where anyone is close to Scheffler going in given his play over the past month including a victory in his last start. Oakmont seems perfect for his game, too.', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: Based on his performance over the last two months, and even dating back to last year, yes, he’s priced appropriately. I hate those odds. I wrote about how they’re in Tiger Woods territory. But you can’t argue against them being so short given the way he’s lapping the competition right now or his history at the U.S. Open. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: Looks absurd—+260 to win a golf tournament—but we’ve seen that before in the Peak Tiger Era and Scheffler is just about in that zone now. Wouldn’t think we’d have seen McIlroy at this high of a price after winning the Masters but the PGA and Canadian Open are cause for concern.', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: Scheffler is certainly priced correctly. If anything I’d argue he should be even more of a favorite based on how he’s played lately and how difficult Oakmont will be for the majority of the field. Rory McIlroy, in my opinion, should have much longer odds. His form has fallen off since winning the Masters and a missed cut at a non-signature event, the Canadian Open, the week before Oakmont is a bad sign.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf:. McIlroy’s game fits Oakmont well, however, his recent driver change has added a wrinkle to that statement. Scheffler is for sure the best player in the game at the moment and should be the heavy favorite. And there’s a good case for DeChambeau over McIlroy. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Scheffler’s spot well clear of the field atop the odds board is correct. There’s a case to be made that he might be putting together a better statistical season than what we saw last year, as absurd as that sounds. The upside with Rory at Oakmont is there but the form, especially with a squirrely driver since the PGA, is a bit worrisome. I second Max’s assertion that Bryson is a warranted challenger to McIlroy as the second favorite in my book.', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: McIlroy’s MC in Canada is a big, bright red flag, and not the one with a maple leaf in the center. I think he’s still the second choice behind Scheffler, but like the rest of this group I like Scottie’s chances much more.', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: If Bryson gets his irons dialed in—an issue for him so far this year—he absolutely has a great chance to repeat. It would probably help more if he hit a lot of fairways. Even brawny Bryson is going to have trouble out of the fearsome Oakmont rough. While he is LIV’s best hope, Jon Rahm is not to be discounted, and one of these days Joaquin Niemann is going to make a run at a major championship.', ""Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: It’s all about his iron game and it’s impossible to tell how dialed they are based on his performances on YouTube and LIV. That’s the one thing holding him back from being on Scottie’s level. At Oakmont, loose shots like he hit at Augusta and Quail Hollow will be punished at a much higher level. If you remember at Pinehurst last year he got away with some loose irons on Sunday with some unbelievable recovery shots. He won’t be able to do that at Oakmont. Not with the greens running that fast and the rough that thick. This is a ball striker's paradise. DeChambeau better come with the goods, but I’m fading him this week. "", 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: Not judging a player’s chances off a YouTube video, but I enjoyed Bryson’s recent trip around Oakmont (2.2 million views and counting) and the respect he gave the place. His game worked at Pinehurst and there’s no reason why it can’t at Oakmont if he’s driving it well. Jon Rahm isn’t to be forgotten either after contending at the PGA. ', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: Oakmont is going to test every skill a golfer has and if there is a single weakness, the course is going to exploit it. That’s why I have little faith in Bryson this week. His irons have not been up to standard in 2025 and that’s going to cause him trouble at Oakmont. Instead, I’d lean more toward Jon Rahm, who while he hasn’t been excellent yet this season, he’s been consistent in every aspect of his game. If his form can take one step forward this week, he has the best chance to take down Scheffler.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf:. There are a few LIV players who could make a run (Rahm, Niemann, Koepka), but DeChambeau has a great chance to repeat if he keeps up his recent form in majors. It would be no surprise if he’s holding the trophy Sunday night. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: I think you’d be crazy to not give Bryson some serious credence this week. His ability to overpower a golf course will be put to the test by a place like Oakmont but he’s also developed beautifully as a blend of power and smarts, which was on full display at Pinehurst. He’s a deserved top threat for LIV this week, but don’t count out Jon Rahm or Joaquin Niemann.', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: DeChambeau is LIV’s best hope entering the week but that rough is foreboding. Can he keep it in the fairway? Like a couple guys mentioned, Jon Rahm has been sneakily consistent this season and he got reacclimated to major pressure at last month’s PGA. He’s my No. 2 betting choice this week behind Scottie and I’m all over him at 12-1.', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: Guys who are hitting it poorly off the tee are tough to back this week. That’s what makes Rory McIlroy so compelling. As good as this venue looked for him when he won the Masters, it looks terrible now given his driver woes. ', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: I’m focused on ball striking and, specifically, recent ball striking. That’s why Rory and Bryson are a fade for me this week. They’re not as dialed as I want them to be on a course like this. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: With Oakmont’s greens I’d like to say I would handicap from the green back to the tee, but there’s no getting around the need to be long and straight this week. If you’re not in the fairway consistently you’ll be lucky to see Saturday, never mind Sunday afternoon.', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: I’m going to completely discount the majority of the field. Any Tour golfer can realistically win at an easy course if they get hot enough, but at a course where mistakes get compounded, any golfer not in the top 10 in the world has little to no shot. Big dogs only this week.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf:. Will this setup be too challenging that we get a random winner? Certainly possible, but anyone who bombs it off the tee and can keep it in the fairway has a chance this week. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Iain might’ve said it best with, to paraphrase, this is a big-dogs-only type of golf course. Nothing is impossible, but it’s definitely less likely than normal that we get any kind of dark horse or sleeper coming out of nowhere to win a major this week. Beyond that, play from the rough and/or length-plus-accuracy off the tee will be getting a lot of attention from yours truly.', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: In terms of win bets, I’m deleting everyone outside the world’s top 30, re-adding Rahm and going from there. Nice time-saver.', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: It’s right up there, and has been given anchor site status by the USGA, which is understandable. But the best U.S. Open venue is Pebble Beach. The scenery, the lack of rain (usually) in the summer, the history (Nicklaus, Watson, Kite, Woods were the first four winners) all make for a special place. You could argue that the USGA should treat it like the R&A does St. Andrews and bring it to Pebble Beach every five years.', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: Shinnecock is my favorite course in the U.S. Open rotation. Similarly as tough as Oakmont, but in a totally different way, the green designs and layout there are simply breathtaking. The clubhouse and history certainly add to that, but vs Oakmont, that’s a bit of a wash. I like seeing players in trouble on tight runoffs better than thick rough, plus I think the piece of land is a bit more appealing, so I’m excited for next year. That said, Oakmont is my second favorite. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: Yes, Oakmont is the best. Of its nine U.S. Open winners, only Sam Parks Jr. didn’t win multiple majors, and the course is straight out of central casting for the USGA. It’s not just the pros who take a beating, the members like it to be major-championship hard for everyday play.  ', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: Yes, it’s my favorite right next to Pinehurst. The U.S. Open has made a brand of itself of being the most difficult test in golf and Oakmont is the course best suited to do exactly that. While places like Pebble Beach are historic, Oakmont checks every box you want for a U.S. Open.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf: It’s certainly one of the most iconic and boasts abundant history, as do many U.S. Open venues. However, I’m a fan of trying places we don’t see very often. Sometimes it works (The Country Club), and sometimes it doesn’t (LACC). But I’m O.K. leaving out venues that we see every year on Tour, like Torrey Pines and (hot take) even Pebble Beach. For historical purposes, we need U.S. Opens at Pebble, but Gary Woodland winning at 13 under in 2019 did not provide the carnage that many USO viewers want. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Especially when it comes to the US Open, I want to see the best players in the world have to grind. Oakmont delivers that type of test and, as a result, it’s certainly near the top of my personal list. ', ""Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: Pebble looks the best on TV and it's my second choice, but for my money Oakmont is the best Open venue because it just embodies everything the championship stands for. "", 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: Will the winning score be under par? Given all the hype around the difficultly of Oakmont and the rough, this seems a fun question. I’d go with yes because there is rain in the forecast and the softer conditions will allow someone to shoot low at least once.', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: I’ll probably bet the winner without Scottie Scheffler market and wager on Collin Morikawa, but the one I like is the anytime hole-in-one at +135 on DraftKings. I know the par 3s are tough here, but with so many great players playing so many holes I think one of them gets it in there and I like the plus odds. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: DraftKings has the over/under winning score at 278.5, shaded to the over as carnage is expected. And there will be, don’t get me wrong, but I think the winner (cough, Scottie, cough) can get to 2 under if not a hair better. And I’ll get +105 for my belief.', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: I’m going to bet on Rory McIlroy to miss the cut. His form has been off since winning the Masters and he wasn’t even close to making the cut at the Canadian Open which had a relatively weak field. There’s not enough time for him to turn his game around before this week’s tournament and his driver issues are likely to persist. ', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf:. All but two U.S. Open champions have been American in the last decade. I think that trend continues. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Lucas Glover is even money to miss the cut at Oakmont and, with all due respect to the 2009 U.S. Open champion, I’m all over that. Glover not only lost 4.67 strokes on approach and 8 strokes overall at the Memorial, but he’s been largely a non-factor in this major over the past decade plus. Throw in a course fit that seems questionable at best, I don’t see him playing the weekend.', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: Iain swiped my idea of taking McIlroy to MC. But look, it’s the Open and anyone—anyone—can get lost in the rough and suddenly make a couple doubles and a quad before they know it. Scottie Scheffler feels like too much of a favorite, and so his odds to miss the cut are also a bloated +750. At that price, why not take a shot? ', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: Wyndham Clark. Can a U.S. Open champion just two years removed really be 100-1? Clark has not been great, but he’s also more than capable if he gets his tee shots in play.', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: I don’t see a long shot winning this week. That doesn’t mean I won’t bet the market, but the cream tends to rise to the top at this course, and I don’t see many opportunities for a long shot to win, though I’m sure many will compete. That said, the guy I’m betting on this week is Keegan Bradley at +10000. His ball striking metrics are all outstanding and his history at the U.S. Open also stands out. The U.S. Ryder Cup captain would punch his ticket to playing at the Ryder Cup with a win too. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: Harris English at 100-1 (DraftKings) looks tasty. He was T12 at the Masters and T2 at the PGA and loves tough courses. He’s 46th on Tour in strokes-gained off the tee and 20th in strokes-gained putting—I’ll take 100 to 1 on those stats, thankyouverymuch.', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: Without taking anything away from Wyndham Clark’s U.S. Open win, Los Angeles Country Club wasn’t what I would call a true USGA venue. It played relatively easy and even in his win, Clark hit plenty of wayward drives that didn’t penalize him too much. Now, he’s in much worse form at a much more difficult course. 100-1 odds are completely warranted in this case.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf:. Matt Fitzpatrick. Though his game has fallen since winning the 2023 RBC Heritage, he showed some life with a T8 at the PGA Championship. He has lost some yards off the tee the past few years, but he can still bomb it, and he’s above average on Tour in driving accuracy. Plus, he’s won a U.S. Open before. I’d take a flyer on him. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Am I rushing to bet Corey Conners at 65-1 (FanDuel)? Probably not — but I can absolutely see the vision. Because of the elite ball-striking with his irons, it often goes overlooked how accurate Conners is off the tee. If he can put that together and not bleed strokes with the short game, which he’s done a good job of late with, he has the chops to contend. ', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: Viktor Hovland is undeniably streaky and maybe even a bit of a head case. But he’s one of the only guys down the board with an A game that would be good enough to win at Oakmont. It would also be a heck of a way to get off the BPWAM list. At 60-1 all you want is a chance, and Hovland has one.', 'Bob Harig, SI Golf: Scottie Scheffler. Not much to think about here. It’s never easy, and Scheffler didn’t have a great U.S. Open last year. But the schedule set up nicer for him this time. He’s coming off a great win at the Memorial and his PGA triumph. Time to get the third leg of the career Grand Slam.', 'Brian Giuffra, SI Betting: It’s probably Scottie, but where’s the fun in that?! The guy I’m targeting this week is Collin Morikawa. He’s got a great history at the U.S. Open with two Top 5s and two Top 15s. He’s one of the most accurate players on tour and his approach game is sublime. The reason I like him this week is that he’s gained shots with the putter in his last three events. You can get him at +2500 at DraftKings. ', 'John Schwarb, SI Golf: Scottie Scheffler. I can’t overthink this one, he is simply on another level from everyone else in the game. ', 'Iain MacMillan, SI Betting: I hate picking the square and obvious guy, but this is Scottie Scheffler’s week. Someone else would have to bring their A++ game to take down the No. 1 golfer in the world. The more difficult the course, the better suited for Scottie and no other golfer excels in every aspect of the game like Scheffler does right now. I’d be shocked if he doesn’t win.', 'Max Schreiber, SI Golf: It’s boring, I know, but Scottie Scheffler is playing too well right now to go against him. Then, we’ll enter the British Open talking about whether he can complete the career Grand Slam. ', 'Cody Williams, FanSided/SI Betting: Honestly, I probably lean Scheffler as well. But let’s dig a little deeper and go with Viktor Hovland to get it done. His short game woes have long been mitigated when the rough makes everything a bit of a dart throw around the greens and he’s been top 5 in the world on approach over the last few months. This feels like a good spot for him to get his maiden major victory.', 'Jeff Ritter, SI Golf: I have hunch Jon Rahm has fully resettled himself after a bumpy move to LIV Golf, and after fading to Scheffler on Sunday at Quail Hollow he’ll be ready for his next turn in the major spotlight. This time he shocks Scheffler and wins career major No. 3.', ""Jeff Ritter is the managing director of SI Golf.

"2025 U.S. Open predictions, picks: Five trends to identify this year's winner at Oakmont Country Club",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-u-s-open-predictions-picks-five-trends-to-identify-this-years-winner-at-oakmont-country-club/,"['', 'OAKMONT, Pa. -- The third major championship of the season has arrived, and if the 2025 U.S. Open is anything like the first two, one can expect to see the normal candidates atop the leaderboard and a few surprises intertwined. While those tournaments were respectively won by Rory McIlroy (Masters) and Scottie Scheffler (PGA Championship), the first two majors were nearly in the hands of a couple of unusual suspects.', 'At Augusta National, it was Justin Rose who posted the clubhouse lead and narrowly lost in a playoff to McIlroy. While Scheffler scorched the earth at Quail Hollow, the leaderboard just beneath him included names such as Harris English, Davis Riley and Jhonattan Vegas, who led for most of the early portion of the championship.', ""Majors seem to be falling in favor of the world's best players now more than ever. The last six have gone to four of the best players in the world -- Scheffler (twice), Xander Schauffele, (twice), McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau -- but a couple bounces here and there, and the stories being told are completely different."", 'That is where these trends can come in hand. They can identify those names that might be getting overshadowed. They can reveal the unlikely source of an underdog. They can add an unlikely character into a championship which many believe only five players can win.', ""Those five players can certainly win -- and one of them may wind up finding the winner's circle Sunday in Pennsylvania -- but let's remember this is golf, and this is a U.S. Open where anything can still take place -- particularly at a test like Oakmont Country Club."", 'Not all of the 156 contenders accumulate OWGR points given where they play the bulk of their golf, but the system does remain accurate for those that do. Each of the last 10 winners have been inside the top 50 in the OWGR -- in fact, only one of the last 53 major champions has been outside that mark with that being Phil Mickelson at the 2021 PGA Championship. Similar to the PGA, the top-50 cutoff for those players on circuits that do accumulate OWGR seems like a good starting point.', 'Eliminated: Non-LIV Golf players outside the top 50 of the OWGR, notably Tom Kim, Cameron Young, Matt Fitzpatrick, Si Woo Kim, Michael Kim, Jhonattan Vegas, Davis Riley', 'The U.S. Open makes the trek up to the suburbs of Pittsburgh for a record 10th time, but not all those in the field will be familiar with Oakmont when they step onto the property. Veterans may have a slight leg up but not a large one given the changes to the golf course since the last time the U.S. Open was held in 2016. Regardless, quality has proven to be an important barometer at this championship in particular as nine of the last 10 champions had a top-25 finish to their name with Wyndham Clark being the outlier.', 'Eliminated: Sepp Straka, Maverick McNealy, Ben Griffin, Robert MacIntyre, J.J. Spaun, Nick Taylor, Ryan Fox, Andrew Novak, Sahith Theegala, J.T. Poston, Tom Hoge, Richard Bland, Jose Ballester, Jinichiro Kozuma, Carlos Ortiz', 'Major champions rarely pop up out of the blue. Before his win at Pinehurst No. 2, DeChambeau was in the mix at the Masters and nearly won the PGA Championship only to be clipped by a single stroke on the 72nd hole. While DeChambeau had not won in 2024 before raising the U.S. Open trophy, he continued a trend of all 10 of the last winners claiming at least one podium finish in the same season before their victories.', 'Eliminated: Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood, Patrick Cantlay, Keegan Bradley, Wyndham Clark, Aaron Rai, Taylor Pendrith, Adam Scott, Tony Finau, Byeong Hun An, Denny McCarthy, Jordan Spieth, Max Greyserman, Cameron Smith, Dustin Johnson', 'The last 10 champions all averaged at least +0.75 strokes gained per round in the three months leading up to their victories. Spieth (2015) headlined the group with +2.80. Koepka (2018) and Jon Rahm (2021) also checked in north of +2.00 strokes gained per round, while Fitzpatrick (+1.96), Clark (+1.93) and DeChambeau (+1.90) settled in right around the +1.95 average of the last 10 winners -- the number we will be using as our benchmark, much to the dismay of many recent major champions and many potential contenders.', 'Eliminated: Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Ludvig Åberg, Russell Henley, Hideki Matsuyama, Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Harris English, Justin Rose, Sam Burns, Sungjae Im, Brian Harman, Daniel Berger, Akshay Bhatia, Min Woo Lee, Thomas Detry, Jason Day, Lucas Glover, Stephan Jaeger, Mackenzie Hughes, Tyrrell Hatton, Marc Leishman, Brooks Koepka, Patrick Reed, Phil Mickelson', 'Our field of 156 players has been trimmed to five, but with what Oakmont demands, one final hurdle will need to be jumped by competitors. Driving competence may never be more important than it is this week. Johnson was gaining +1.27 strokes off the tee per round in the lead up to his win at Oakmont, and a similar output is likely to be required from the eventual champion. The last 10 winners have averaged +0.84 strokes gained off the tee, which will be the cut-off point for our purposes.', 'Eliminated: Corey Conners, Joaquin Niemann', 'Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm', 'Well, no surprises here. DeChambeau and Rahm have been the two best drivers of the golf ball over the last three months, and that showed at various stages of the PGA Championship. DeChambeau would be the first since Koepka to successfully defend his U.S. Open, while Rahm would add his second title belt as well.', ""The concern for both players lie on approach as both are experiencing down years in that strokes-gained category while Scheffler continues to thrive. The world No. 1 is the heavy favorite, and it is for good reason as he is the most well-rounded player in the game (not necessarily always the case). He'll need to rebound from his T41 finish a season ago at Pinehurst No. 2 where he entered with high expectations, but I wouldn't be betting against that."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Soggy start to U.S. Open week as Jordan Spieth among early Oakmont arrivals,https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/soggy-start-to-u-s-open-week-as-jordan-spieth-among-early-oakmont-arrivals,"['OAKMONT, Pa. — Players began arriving at Oakmont on Sunday with umbrellas and expectations for a U.S. Open to live up to its reputation as golf’s toughest test.', 'Jordan Spieth was among the early arrivals, playing the front nine on Saturday and 11 holes on Sunday in a light, but steady rain. Turns out the USGA had a policy that no one could start on No. 10. Spieth went down the first, back up the ninth and headed to No. 10.', 'It was long. And it was wet. The area got pounded with rain on Friday, and heavy rain was expected again Sunday afternoon. As if Oakmont wasn’t already tough enough.', '“This course is built to be like this,” Spieth said. “So they’re not doing a whole lot different to the golf course. You hit a good shot, you get rewarded for it here. And if you don’t, you’re in big trouble. It’s pure golf, no funny business about it.”', 'Spieth was keeping score on this day — he gave himself an 18-inch birdie putt after a 50-yard chip on the short par-4 17th and was 2 under for the day. He also did plenty of chipping and putting. On one hole, he had his caddie throw him golf balls down into the bunker. The grass was so thick it gobbled up the balls before they reached to the sand.', 'The rough was as advertised, mainly the sheer density of it, and it was made even more difficult considering how wet it was.', 'Spieth wasn’t worried so much about the grass off the fairway — everyone has to deal with that at some point during the U.S. Open. It was what followed.', '“It magnifies once you make a mistake if you don’t play the right shot,” he said. “It’s not like making a mistake is the end of the world. It might cost you half a shot. You just have to take what it gives you.”', 'More than 60 players in the U.S. Open field were at the Memorial two weeks ago, which also featured rough that was longer and thicker than normal. Growing grass has not been an issue in the Ohio Valley this year. The difference is the speed of Oakmont’s greens — reputed to be the fastest in the land — and not many forced carries.', '“This test here, because they give you more runways to try to run it up to the green, it entices you to think you can do more than you should,” Spieth said. “That will be the biggest challenge this week — swallowing pride. Bogeys don’t hurt you. Anything more will.”', 'The forecast was for more scattered showers on Monday, and then a break from the rain until the weekend.', 'Oakmont is hosting the U.S. Open for a record 10th time, and its reputation is strong enough that even the best can expect a strong test. First impressions, of course, can be misleading.', 'Shane Lowry recalls seeing it for the first time on the Sunday before the 2016 U.S. Open. He started on No. 10, played five holes and walked in, wondering how he could ever manage a decent score around Oakmont. A week later, he went into the final round with a four-shot lead.', '“It was firm and fast when I played it that Sunday, and it was windy. We got a bit of rain that week, which helped us,” Lowry recalled.', 'The flip side was Adam Scott. He first played Oakmont the week before 2007 U.S. Open with Geoff Ogilvy, who was the defending U.S. Open champion that year.', '“I played really great that day and Geoff didn’t, so I was feeling really chipper about myself,” Scott said. He returned a week later feeling confident as ever.', '“I hit six greens in two days and flew back to Australia,” he said. “It really hit me hard.”', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Check back for more updates when they do get revealed to the public in the coming days.', 'Odds courtesy of BetMGM as of Monday, June 9', ""Analysis: It's not hard to explain why Scottie Scheffler is the massive odds-on-favorite at +275.

This includes his last time out at the Memorial Tournament at the beginning of the month on June 1 and took home his first ever PGA Championship last month."", ""Scheffler's victory at Quail Hollow was the third major win in his career, still chasing the career grand slam as he as yet to claim a victory in the U.S. Open and the Open Championship, which will take place from July 17-20 from Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland."", ""Behind Scheffler is last year's winner DeChambeau at +750, who has had the aforementioned recent success in this tournament with two victories in the last four years."", ""Mcllroy comes in tied with fellow Masters winner Jon Rahm at 11/1 (+1100), with those four golfers as the clear favorites in the oddsmakers minds.

"2025 U.S. Open odds, favorites: Scottie Scheffler firmly atop field featuring Bryson DeChambeau, Rory McIlroy",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-u-s-open-odds-favorites-scottie-scheffler-firmly-atop-field-featuring-bryson-dechambeau-rory-mcilroy/,"['', 'The 125th U.S. Open has arrived, and the thoroughbreds are at the gates of Oakmont Country Club. Welcoming 156 players to the outskirts of Pittsburgh, Oakmont plays host to the 2025 U.S. Open for a record 10th time.', ""Nine years ago, when Oakmont last hosted, it was world No. 3 Dustin Johnson who reigned supreme, continuing a run of dominance atop the sport. Nearly a decade later, the game's top players have created an even wider gulf as this edition of the national championship approaches."", 'That is due, in large part, to world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, now a three-time major champion who has captured the first two legs of the career grand slam (in order). Arriving in Pittsburgh with three wins across his last four starts, including victories at the PGA Championship and the Memorial, Scheffler seeks to become the first golfer since Jordan Spieth in 2015 to win back-to-back majors. ', 'Scheffler is going off as a heavy 11/4 favorite -- a number not seen at a major championship since Tiger Woods in his prime. However, Scheffler stumbled in a similar position last year at Pinehurst No. 2, and it was a pair of his counterparts in Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy who picked up the pieces, ultimately contending for the title.', ""DeChambeau, the reigning U.S. Open champion, has jumped past McIlroy on the odds board in recent weeks as his play continues to impress as McIlroy's continues to decline. No matter, these three men have won three of the last four majors with the only other belonging to Xander Schauffele, who rounds out the short list of names below 20-1."", ""Let's check out the full list of odds for the 125th U.S. Open as presented on FanDuel Sportsbook."", 'The five players on top hold nearly 60% of the win probability, and it is tough to argue with the oddsmakers. Granted, about half of that comes from Scheffler, who is surging into the U.S. Open, but another reason for the disparity -- despite the 156-man field -- is the recent resurgence of 2021 champion Jon Rahm.', ""Rahm has now finished inside the top 15 across his last three majors, and he posed as Scheffler's greatest threat down the stretch of the PGA Championship. While he limped to the finish line, the two-time major champion is not one to be trifled with and may hold the best value at 12-1."", ""There are some players among the contenders who have not won in quite some time -- Morikawa, Fleetwood and Cantlay, most notably. There are some others who have multiple victories this year alone. Let's side with the latter crop that includes Niemann -- fresh off his fourth LIV Golf title of the year and his best major championship result of his career at the PGA -- as well as Straka, who has already won in Pennsylvania this year."", ""Straka's blend of accuracy off the tee and precision into the greens -- he ranks second only to Scheffler in terms of iron play -- seems like an ideal combination at Oakmont. His short game will need to come up big and he will need to end a mini skid in majors as he has missed the cut in both in 2025."", ""If this group seems like no man's land, well, that's the perfect way to describe it. Some serious name value here that could be worthy of wagers and some others that will make you look stupid. Matsuyama has been sensational in U.S. Opens throughout his career with eight top-21 finishes in 12 appearances, but he is without a top 10 since the first week of January."", 'Spieth could surprise given his driving acumen, while the most in-form player of this bunch (Griffin) makes his championship debut. Conners and Henley have two of the higher floors but their ceilings are not as high as major winners like Koepka.', 'Truthfully, these names are more attractive then those listed above despite being clear sleepers at 100-1 and worse. Bradley, Reed and English are the three players that have been circled. The U.S. Ryder Cup captain comes into the U.S. Open fresh off back-to-back top 10s at the PGA Championship and the Memorial.', 'Meanwhile, English is one of only a few players to finish inside the top 15 in both major championships this season; he has acquitted himself nicely in U.S. Opens throughout his career. Reed seems like a wildcard at first glance, but he has actually been quite steady in this championship with only one career missed cut and four top-20 finishes in his last seven appearances.', 'As we make our way through the rest of the odds below, consistent runner-up Phil Mickelson (270-1) appears set to be making his last U.S. Open start this year. He comes in with some form having just contended at LIV Golf Virginia. The nostalgics may throw some coin on Lefty, but the more prudent option may be someone like Davis Thompson (200-1) and Rasmus Hojgaard (300-1). These young players have tremendous upside and could find their way onto the first page of the leaderboard if the stars align.', ""Who will win the U.S. Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard and best bets, all from the model that's nailed 15 golf majors, including the past four Masters.

The duo has applied their wisdom to numerous top-shelf properties around the world, Oakmont included. In a project that lasted about eight months in 2023, they spearheaded what easily is classified as a restoration, but more distinctly could be labeled as a recapturing of what Henry Clay (H.C.) Fownes and his son, William, designed over time once they began shifting and shaping the earth just after the turn of the 20th century.', 'Oakmont is the only course that the Fowneses ever designed, but they didn’t stop redesigning it. So, per the assignment, Hanse & Co. dug into the records and emerged with what is their all-star lineup of holes selected from a variety of years when the Fowneses were busy. In other words, preeminent designers of current day applied a collective keen eye with the highest respect for yesteryear for what arguably is the strongest representation of the founding fathers’ best ideas in the aggregate on what is widely the most respected venue for the national championship in the United States. That’s all.', 'In comparison to how it presented nine years ago, Oakmont is 153 yards longer, so it now tips at 7,372 yards, although five par 4s with increases ranging from 18 yards to 36 yards comprise 122 yards of that bump. What were already large greens are even larger and average 8,500 square feet. And that’s entirely necessary given that many are segmented by undulations and that the Poa annua surfaces once again are expected to exceed 14 feet using the Stimpmeter.', 'The size of the targets further eases some of the sting of drives that come to rest in 5-inch rough, but there’s much more reward in finding the shortest of the grass off the tee. This is the U.S. Open, after all.', 'In addition to reintroducing options off tees and retaining blind shots, the latest project yielded a reduction of 42 bunkers. There are now 168, including, of course, the iconic ""Church Pews"" shared by the par-4 third and par-5 fourth holes.', 'Of the 156 qualifiers, 31 competed in the 2016 U.S. Open. That includes Dustin Johnson, who led the field in distance of measured drives, greens in regulation and scrambling en route to victory at 4-under 276. He also ranked T18 in fairways hit. Shane Lowry (T2) and Jason Day (T8) are the only two others inside that top 10 who are back this year.', 'Mother Nature will behave until after the cut of low 60 and ties after two rounds. Dry conditions and light winds will allow everyone on site to feel the 80-degree air on Thursday and Friday, but she may have something to say about the flow of the weekend when rain and the potential of storms enters the equation.

Paulie's Picks: Best Longshot Odds for the 2025 U.S. Open at Oakmont,https://www.thefriedegg.com/articles/2025-us-open-oakmont-longshots-betting-odds,"['Three undervalued players who can help you win your office pools and fantasy contests', 'In my previous article, I talked about what it takes to succeed at Oakmont Country Club and made the case for a few of the favorites. Now let’s dig into three longshot players who can help you win your office pools and fantasy contests.', 'Ben Griffin is the definition of riding the hot hand. His win back in April at the Zurich Classic with Andrew Novak really opened the floodgates of success. In his last three starts, he finished eighth at the PGA Championship, won at the Charles Schwab Challenge, and finished runner-up to Scottie Scheffler at the Memorial. His success hasn’t been lucky, either, as he gained strokes in all four main categories in each of those three events. He is firing on all cylinders right now in every facet of his game, so 75/1 seems too good to pass up for a player who comes into this championship in the best form of anyone not named Scottie Scheffler.', 'Harris English has made the cut in all nine of his U.S. Open appearances, including top-eight finishes in three of the last five years. He already won earlier this year at Torrey Pines and finished runner-up at the PGA Championship. He also finished 12th at both the Memorial and the Masters. He ranks 19th in the field off the tee and has gained strokes in each of his last four events. English could be one solid finish away from virtually locking up his place on the U.S. Ryder Cup team at Bethpage.', 'Aaron Rai is one of only eight players in the field to rank in the top 20 in approach and off the tee. His Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee is all based on accuracy, as he leads the PGA Tour in fairways hit. This could be a pivotal week if Rai wants to make a push for inclusion on Team Europe at Bethpage later this year. He finished 19th at last year’s U.S. Open, his first U.S. Open since 2017. Similar to Collin Morikawa, this is probably one of the best U.S. Open venues for him. He can just play his game and plod along with pars and stay in contention the whole week while others fall by the wayside.', ""Paulie is Fried Egg Golf's resident gambling expert (not to be confused with PJ Clark, who is our resident PGA Tour Champions gambling expert)."", '*Our readers make more birdies', 'Sign up to our newsletter for fresh takes Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXNUVGM1V1RKV1JWcE5XbkJNVFJEUEFoaVVCeWdLTWdhMVE0aFJKUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Fresh off his Masters win in April, McIlroy joined an elite group as just the sixth golfer in history to complete a career Grand Slam. He previously claimed the U.S. Open crown in 2011, his first career major victory, and enters this year's tournament with three wins on the season despite a lackluster T-47 finish at the PGA Championship. McIlroy is +1100 (risk $100 to win $1,100) in the latest 2025 U.S. Open odds. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, fresh off a win at the 2025 PGA Championship, is the betting favorite at +280, while defending champion Bryson DeChambeau is +700."", 'Should you back McIlroy or Scheffler when making 2025 US Open picks? Should you target potential longshots like Jordan Spieth (+6500), Jason Day (+6500), or Dustin Johnson (+8000) in 2025 U.S. Open betting? Before locking in your 2025 U.S. Open picks or entering any PGA DFS tournaments on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.', ""SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament."", 'This same model has also nailed a whopping 15 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- and the 2025 PGA Championship.

Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.', ""One shocker the model is calling at the U.S. Open 2025: Rory McIlroy, a five-time major champion, stumbles this week and doesn't even crack the top five. McIlroy's win at Augusta was his third of the PGA Tour season and puts him at 44 worldwide victories for his career. However, he's played a limited schedule since completing the career grand slam and has struggled mightily of late."", ""The No. 2 player in the OWGR has only played three solo events in the two months since his emotional victory in the 2025 Masters, finishing t-7th at the Truist Championship, t-47th in the PGA Championship and then missing the cut entirely last week at the RBC Canadian Open. McIlroy blew up with a second-round 80 in Canada's national championship and now he'll have a game that is faltering tested by brutal conditions at Oakmont, where he missed the cut at the 2016 U.S. Open."", 'The model has also locked in its projection for Scottie Scheffler, who is coming off a dominant win at the PGA Championship. Scheffler got off to a slow start in 2025 (by his lofty standards) as he recovered from a hand injury, but quickly turned things around. In 11 starts in 2025, Scheffler has racked up eight top-10 finishes and two outright wins, and has now held the World No. 1 ranking since May 2023, a stretch that now spans more than 100 weeks.', ""When it comes to major championships, the U.S. Open has arguably been his most challenging. It's where he has the fewest top-25 finishes (three) and the most missed cuts (two) compared to the other majors. Still, when Scheffler is at his best, he's always in the mix, with two top-three finishes in his last three U.S. Open appearances. Scheffler has limited course history at Oakmont, having played it just once during his major debut at the 2016 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut as a 19-year-old amateur."", ""Meanwhile, the model has examined Bryson DeChambeau's chances of repeating as champion. With a victory this week, DeChambeau will become the first golfer to successfully defend his U.S. Open title since Brooks Koepka (2017-18). He's been red-hot in majors thus far in 2025, securing a T-5 finish at the Masters and a T-2 finish at the PGA Championship. He was in the final pairing with McIlroy at the Masters before a final-round 75 put him out of contention. "", ""DeChambeau has also finished inside the top six in five of the six majors since the start of 2024. No other golfer has more than three top-six finishes in majors during that span, so he knows what it takes to compete on golf's grandest stages. See the full U.S. Open projections from the model here."", ""The model is also targeting five golfers with odds longer than 25-1 who will make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big.

Oakmont is going to play like a tougher version of Muirfield Village, and that’s why I like Thomas to turn some heads.

In Bryson’s last eight major starts, he has only lost strokes to the field with his putter or short game ONCE. These are by far the toughest tests these guys play all year, and DeChambeau has proven he can close on and around the greens.

One of the last times he shot over par in the past three years, he was arrested the day before. The fact is, Scheffler is somehow getting better. Over his past five starts, Scheffler is gaining an average of 14 strokes on the field. How can you compete with a player who is 3.5 strokes better than you per round? Scheffler is on an amazing run, and the only thing missing is the ability to string a couple of wins together.

He finished 14th at the Masters and eighth at the PGA Championship, and was in contention late at Valhalla before stumbling on Sunday.', 'Rahm is already a US Open champion and is built to handle what Oakmont demands: Elite tee-to-green play, touch around the greens and confidence with the short putts that will define this week. He has that extra gear that few players possess, and his salary offers some leverage.', 'Patrick Cantlay ($9,300)', 'It’s been a frustrating run for Cantlay backers at majors, and a missed cut at the PGA added fuel to the fire . Still, he bounced back with a 12th at Memorial and remains one of the most consistent drivers on Tour, even without elite distance.', 'His around-the-green game has been shaky — he’s lost strokes in that category in six straight events — and that’s a concern at Oakmont. But Cantlay does have a strong US Open record, including a third place last year and four straight top-15s at this major. As a DFS play, he’s a solid second or third piece in balanced builds, and his ownership will likely reflect his volatile profile.', 'Tommy Fleetwood ($8,800)', 'Fleetwood continues to defy logic with how often he contends without ever closing the deal. That said, he’s always been most comfortable in major championship conditions — especially at the US Open.', 'He’s gained on approach in seven straight starts, and his streaky putting can provide the necessary upside. While he must avoid the blow-up holes like everyone else, Fleetwood’s overall consistency and US Open pedigree make him a strong option in all formats.', 'Tyrrell Hatton ($7,600)', 'Here is another LIV player on the list but one with real potential. Hatton was excellent at Augusta, finishing 14th despite a poor putting week. His experience on tough Euro Tour tracks (wind, firm conditions, hazards galore) gives him a real edge in chaotic setups like Oakmont.', 'His US Open record is a mixed bag, but the mid-$7,000 price makes him a high-upside value. If he makes the cut, he’s the type of grinder who can climb the leaderboard with a steady weekend.', 'Cameron Young ($6,500)', 'This one’s risky — but risk is necessary if you’re playing Scheffler or loading up at the top.', 'Young nearly won last week in Canada, falling just short in regulation after bogeying the par-5 18th. Still, he showed his game is trending in the right direction. His distance off the tee is a major asset, but it won’t be enough alone — he must improve the irons and avoid a cold putter.', 'The good news is Young’s putting has been trending better, and $6,500 is a fantastic price. He’s likely to be popular after his near win, but he remains one of the strongest low-end tournament values on the board.', '', '(Weather updates TBD early in the week — monitor forecasts daily.)', 'Oakmont can play even tougher with wind, firm conditions or rain-impacted rough.

"2025 U.S. Open odds, favorites: Why you should cheer, consider picking these nine golfers at Oakmont",https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2025-u-s-open-odds-favorites-why-you-should-cheer-consider-picking-these-nine-golfers-at-oakmont/,"['', 'The 2025 U.S. Open returns to one of its most iconic venues: Oakmont Country Club. It is a course that was quite literally built to be as difficult as possible, which makes it the perfect fit for the major championship that prides itself on providing the toughest test to one of the largest fields in golf.', 'You will hear a lot about the rough (planned to be 5 inches, sticking straight up), green speeds (running over 14 on the stimpmeter) and bunkers (well over 100 on the property) this week, all of which make Oakmont the challenge it has positioned itself to be. The players are well aware of what awaits them, and they also know that after a run of low scores winning U.S. Opens since 2019, fans want to watch them ""suffer"" this week. ', 'The player who ultimately emerges as the winner will have undoubtedly earned their title as a major champion, and as we get set to enjoy the carnage, I wanted to highlight some names near the top of the field worth cheering throughout the week.', 'From major champions looking to make some history to players that have been knocking on the door, here are nine players deserving of your rooting interest at Oakmont. Odds via Caesars Sportsbook', ""1. Bryson DeChambeau (15/2): Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler have combined for six wins and the first two major championships of the season. A Dechambeau victory at Oakmont would make this one of the all-time great years of major golf. We constantly talk about DeChambeau's length off the tee , and it will be a weapon once again this week, but the reason he won his second U.S. Open last year at Pinehurst No. 2 was his short game improvement. He's elite on and around the greens now, and on Oakmont's lightning fast greens, that touch will be just as important as his abilities off the tee. A third U.S. Open win would put DeChambeau in rarified air alongside Tiger Woods, Hale Irwin, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Bobby Jones and Willie Anderson as the only three-time victors at this event. "", ""2. Scottie Scheffler (11/4): Golf fans have always been drawn to dominant players, and Scheffler appears poised to become the next one. He's won three of his last four starts (T4 in the lone loss) and enters Oakmont as the strongest favorite in a major since Tiger in 2009. If he can live up to that status and win his fourth career major, he'll move even closer to that all-time top 10 (seven) while still being just 28 years old. He'd also move an Open Championship away from the career grand slam, setting up quite the storyline going into Royal Portrush this July. There isn't a golf course that's not a good fit for Scheffler, but Oakmont's demands of accuracy and precision seem to play right into his strengths. "", ""3. Ludvig Åberg (25-1): It's been an odd year for Åberg as he looked dominant early before struggling from The Players through the PGA Championship, but now, he seems to be rounding back into form. He looks poised to be the next young star in the game, and it's hard to think of a better place to make a statement with your first major win than Oakmont. When Åberg is at his best, he's one of the most accurate ball-strikers on the planet. If that version of the 24-year-old Swede can show up at Oakmont (as he did last year at the Masters and U.S. Open), he will be a real threat. "", ""4. Sepp Straka (40-1): Few players have had a better 2025 season than Straka, who has two wins (including a signature event at the Truist), three other top 10s and six other top 20 finishes this season. He's also coming off a third-place finish at the Memorial, which is the closest thing players will get to a U.S. Open test on the PGA Tour schedule. He's second to Scheffler in strokes gained total on the PGA Tour this season, incredibly accurate off the tee and phenomenal with his irons on approach. We'll see if he's got the gear needed to win a U.S. Open, but don't be surprised if he's on the first page of the leaderboard all weekend."", ""5. Jon Rahm (12-1): For 69 holes, Rahm had a phenomenal PGA Championship. The final three holes saw him implode and somehow not finish in the top 5 (a horrific bad beat for T5 betters), but after the final round, he said it was the most fun he's had on the golf course in a long time. Rahm will be chasing that high again at Oakmont, which will be a different test than the Torrey Pines course he won his U.S. Open on in 2021, but he knows how to navigate a USGA setup ,and I think he had the fire lit under him again by getting in the mix at Quail Hollow. "", ""6. Ben Griffin (66-1): The hottest golfer on the PGA Tour this side of Scheffler, Griffin is looking to ride this wave into Oakmont and contend once again. He's got two wins since the Masters (one being a team event with Andrew Novak), a top 10 finish at the PGA for his best career major result and hung with Scheffler for most of 72 holes at the Memorial last week. I'd love to see Griffin and his massive aviators rolling through Western Pennsylvania this week with a chance to win late Sunday. "", ""7. Tyrrell Hatton (50-1): Watching Hatton this week will be exciting as golf's most mercurial player will be contesting the world's hardest golf course. That's going to be absolute cinema. Nothing about the Hatton experience this week would shock me. He could legitimately win this golf tournament or he shoot a score in the 80s and break three clubs on his way into the clubhouse. It's all on the table, and for that reason, you should be paying attention to him this week, even if you're partially rooting for a meltdown. "", ""8. Collin Morikawa (25-1): All week we are going to be talking about accuracy because the rough at Oakmont is arguably the most penal rough of any course in the world. Morikawa is second on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy, hitting nearly 73% of fairways, which should give him a leg up on most of the field. The constant question for Morikawa is if he can make putts, but it seems he does better on tougher, faster greens -- perhaps in part because it's hard for anyone to make long putts. Some of his best putting rounds in recent years have come at Augusta National, and Oakmont's greens are even faster. "", ""9. Shane Lowry (33-1): The last time the U.S. Open was played at Oakmont, Lowry held a four-shot lead thru 54 holes before shooting a 6-over 76 in the final round to lose to Dustin Johnson by three. It was the first of many gutting losses for the Irishman, who did get his breakthrough at the 2019 Open that will make him a major champion forever. Still, his trophy shelf should be fuller, and he's been playing some really good golf again this year without any hardware to show for it. He's accurate off the tee and has the ball-striking and putting to get it done; it's just a matter of putting four complete rounds together. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

U.S. Open 2025: 5 players who will help you win your pool,https://www.golfdigest.com/story/us-open-2025-pool-picks,"['', 'BETSPERTS GOLF', ""Editor's Note: This article is published in partnership with Betsperts Golf, a Golf Digest content partner."", 'Michael Reaves', 'The 2025 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club promises to be a brutal test of golf. Narrow fairways, thick rough and lightning-fast greens await the field. To win your U.S. Open pool, you need players who thrive under pressure and fit Oakmont’s demanding setup. This article highlights five golfers who I believe can boost your chances: Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, Russell Henley, Harris English and Emiliano Grillo. Each brings unique strengths to tackle this major.', 'Let’s dive into why these players stand out and how to leverage their skills for your U.S. Open pool.', 'Oakmont is a beast. Known for its punishing layout, it rewards precision and mental toughness. Every piece of content we’ve seen about this place has been adding to the level of fear these golfers should have coming in. The rough will be unwieldy and the greens fast and firm. Nothing will come easily.', ""RELATED: U.S. Open 2025: Which course is the best U.S. Open venue? Our 'definitive' ranking"", 'Your pool strategy should prioritize players with strong tee-to-green games and U.S. Open experience. Why? Oakmont punishes mistakes. A single wayward drive can lead to bogeys or worse. These five players have the tools to navigate the challenge.', ""RELATED: U.S. Open 2025: Oakmont's church pew bunkers, explained"", 'This article was published in partnership with Betsperts Golf, one of the leading data-analyzing tools in the industry.

Now's a great time to use it—so you can win your U.S. Open pools with some advanced stats!"", 'Alex Goodlett', 'Rahm’s a proven winner who ranks second in the field in Total Driving (a metric that combines driving distance with accuracy) in 2025. With the nasty rough, accuracy will be a must for anyone looking to score and keep themselves within striking distance of the top. So far this year, Rahm’s short game seems to be in order, too, gaining on the field at both Augusta and Quail Hollow with his putter.', 'It’s tough to bite the bullet and grab some of the LIV golfers who we don’t get to see as much, but Rahm has been able to handle tough courses in the past. While he hasn’t been able to add another major since his win at Augusta in 2023, he has four top-10 major finishes since—plus three consecutive top-15s at golf’s biggest events.', 'Listen to Golf Digest\'s weekly betting podcast, ""The Loop,"" (above) where we interview the industry\'s leading experts (and sometimes tour pros) to help you make your bets and pick your fantasy lineups. And be sure to subscribe to ""The Loop"" wherever you get your podcasts!', 'Harry How', 'Fleetwood might not win golf tournaments, but he excels on tough tracks, and in contest play, you’ll need some golfers who simply have a high floor. Fleetwood’s accuracy off the tee suits Oakmont’s narrow fairways. His iron play is equally sharp, with a decent enough Greens in Regulation percentage to consider him a threat just based on his ball-striking.', 'What makes him a U.S. Open pool gem? Fleetwood’s consistency. In just major championships over the past five years, he has more top-five finishes (4) than missed cuts (3). With a T-4 at Colonial and a T-16 at The Memorial, Fleetwood’s coming in with some nice form, making him a nice grab in the secondary tier.', 'RELATED: U.S. Open 2025: This device will be all the rage at Oakmont. So what is a Stimpmeter anyway?', 'Michael Reaves', 'Russell Henley is built for Oakmont and will always be a model darling when looking at approach play. His iron play is elite. No matter how you sort it, he’s going to be around the top 10 in most metrics that measure second shots. He’s got a win this year and has a few nice finishes in majors so far in his career.', 'It’s been an inconsistent past few months with missed cuts at the Masters and PGA Championship, but I’m fine buying low on his skill set. Oakmont rewards players who hit greens, and Henley’s GIR% ranks sixth in the field over the past six months. Maybe not a threat to get his second win of the year here, but Henley is certainly a nice dark horse to compete and bolster your U.S. Open picks.', 'RELATED: U.S. Open 2025: Matthew Vogt quit his college golf team and stopped competing for 7 years. His journey back to Oakmont is as unlikely as it gets', 'Icon Sportswire', 'Harris English is back in form and playing much better than he’s maybe getting credit for. After injuries, he went out and posted a T-2 at the 2025 PGA Championship. It’s hard to say that his game will continue to translate on such a tough track, but he’s not only been very accurate off the tee, he’s been putting incredibly well this season. Short game is always important, but especially at an event where grinding for par is so vital.', 'Over his past 12 rounds, he’s gained 1.47 strokes over the field per round, not losing in any of the major categories. English might be another nice name down the board that can sneak into the top 10 here.', 'Minas Panagiotakis', 'Grillo is a sleeper pick just based on his recent form. While his putting is a bit suspect, he’s near-elite in ball-striking and has been on a bit of a tear of late (for someone this far down the board). While some of his finishes were at “lesser” events, it’s hard to say that his approach play won’t translate here.', 'Again, his short game leaves something to be desired, but when you’re making your final selections for a pool contest, you’re usually looking through a big list of flawed players. Grillo might not have all the skills needed to win this, but he certainly has enough to play all four days and make a run up the board on Sunday.', 'The No. 1 rule of pool strategy is always to tailor your approach to the size of the contest. If you’re playing with eight guys from work, you may want to throw out most of what you just read and just pick one of the three biggest names in each tier.', 'A larger contest field requires a bit more nuance, with the winners finding value picks down the board and avoiding the extremely popular names in each tier. Payouts should also be part of the calculus as a contest where the winner takes all should lend an even riskier strategy, as playing it safe and placing high pays the same as flaming out.', 'Best of luck in all your contests, and enjoy Oakmont! This might be a week where even par takes home a trophy on Sunday afternoon. Don’t be afraid to adjust and change your strategy based on the weather or course conditions as we get closer to Thursday morning.', ""Golf Digest readers can get access to Betsperts' leading data tool, the Rabbit Hole, for just $5 this week by using the promo code GDWEEKLY.

(Rick Stewart/Getty Images)', 'A', 'Change Text Size', 'The 125th U.S. Open sets up shop June 12-15 at famed Oakmont Country Club, just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Here are nine things to know about the championship.', 'Oakmont has hosted 17 USGA championships, second only to Merion Golf Club’s 19. The 2025 U.S. Open will be the 10th for the club, following those in 1927 (won by Tommy Armour), 1935 (Sam Parks Jr.), 1953 (Ben Hogan), 1962 (Jack Nicklaus), 1973 (Johnny Miller), 1983 (Larry Nelson), 1994 (Ernie Els), 2007 (Àngel Cabrera) and 2016 (Dustin Johnson).', 'Previous majors include two U.S. Women’s Opens, in 1992 (Patty Sheehan) and 2010 (Paula Creamer). Toss in six U.S. Amateurs (1919, ’25, ’38, ’69, 2002 and 2021) and you have a club that’s bred for majors.', 'Oakmont has also been the scene of three PGA Championships, in 1922 (won by Gene Sarazen), 1951 (Sam Snead) and 1978 (John Mahaffey).', 'Future plans for Oakmont call for U.S. Opens in 2033, 2042 and 2049, the U.S. Women’s Open in 2028 and 2038, a Walker Cup in 2032, and a U.S. Women’s Amateur in 2046.', 'Oakmont owes its legendary diabolical character to the intent of its founder, Pittsburgh steel magnate Henry Fownes (1856-1935). A mid-life convert to golf whose enthusiasm was stoked by turn-of-the-century trips to St. Andrews, he set out in 1903-04 to build the most difficult golf course in Pittsburgh. He found 191 acres of ideally rolling farmland 14 miles northeast of downtown. There, Fownes employed 150 laborers to dig vast pits for bunkers and to drain the land with lateral trenches that served double duty as hazards. A fine golfer who played in five U.S. Amateurs, he would serve Oakmont dutifully as club president until his death in 1935.', 'Oakmont was Fownes’ “one-hit wonder,” the only course he ever designed – and certainly one of the greatest in the American golf landscape.', 'The Fownes family’s oversight of Oakmont continued in the hands of the founder’s son, William Clark Fownes Jr. (1877-1950). He was one of the state’s finest amateur golfers, having won eight Western Pennsylvania Amateur Championships, two Western Pennsylvania Opens, four Pennsylvania Amateur title and competed in 19 U.S. Amateurs. In 1922, he was the winning U.S. player captain of the first U.S. Walker Cup and served as USGA president from 1926-27. After serving 24 years as Oakmont’s green chairman, he became club president, holding the post from 1935-1946.', 'Truly, Oakmont in its foundational years was a Fownes family affair.', '1962: Nine U.S. Opens produce a lot of memorable moments. Among the most symbolic for the game overall was the virtual “changing of the guard” in 1962. That’s when a 31-year-old Arnold Palmer (with five majors to his credit and status as the reigning king of golf) faced off against 22-year-old PGA TOUR rookie Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus shot a 71 and won by four strokes to claim the first of what would become a record setting 18 professional majors.', '1973: Johnny Miller was still relatively new to the golf world when he teed off in the fourth round, two hours ahead and six shots back of co-leaders Arnold Palmer and Julius Boros. Neither of his two previous PGA TOUR wins prepared anyone for what was about to happen that afternoon. A driving range swing adjustment that saw him open his stance slightly produced, in his mind, much better ball-striking. Birdies on the first four holes set the tone, and despite a three-putt bogie on the long par-3 eighth hole, four more birdies on the back led to a U.S. Open-record-closing 63 and a two-shot win. The panache by which Miller pulled off the win launched him into the upper reaches of the PGA TOUR stardom, with a reputation as someone who could go theatrically low.', '2016: Dustin Johnson’s breakthrough major win came after two previous disappointments. At the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, he squandered a third-round lead with a very messy second hole; and later that year he was assessed a two-stroke penalty for grounding his club in a bunker at the 72nd hole, dropping him out of a playoff. But at Oakmont in 2016, he finally fulfilled his major promise by overcoming a four-shot deficit with a closing round 69 that saw him defeat Jim Furyk, Shane Lowry and Scott Piercy. The drama of his win was enhanced by the lingering tension of a one-shot penalty hanging over his head from his golf ball having moved on the fifth green just before he putted out – a penalty that was finally assessed after the round, before he signed his scorecard. In part because of that incident, the USGA ultimately changed the rule so that it would no longer be an infraction.', 'Part of what made Oakmont such a notoriously difficult course were two techniques deployed by the club’s famed greenkeeper, Emil Loeffler Jr., who presided at Oakmont from 1916-48. Among his devilish devices was a special water-filled, 750-pound greens roller used to smooth out the putting surfaces; they were forerunners of the modern hydraulic rollers now widely used on golf courses. Perhaps more diabolical was deployment of a heavy-tined bunker rake that created 2- to 3-inch-deep sand furrows in the bunkers – considerably complicating recovery and not abandoned as a standard tool of championship set up at Oakmont until the 1953 U.S. Open (when they were eliminated for fairway bunkers) and finally for the 1962 U.S. Open altogether.', 'The bunkers are still hazardous. Befitting Oakmont’s reputation as a “survival of the fittest” torture chamber, there were bunkers everywhere, allegedly as many as 350 of them at one point, though the oblique angle of historic aerial photography does not allow for visual confirmation of quite that many. In any case, there are wild bunkers everywhere, including a 13-row ""Church Pew"" hazard straddling the third and fourth holes, and a smaller seating of nine rows for the Church Pew bunker on the 15th hole.', 'Jordan Spieth plays a shot from the Church Pew bunkers on the 15th hole during the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club. (Christian Petersen/Getty Images)', 'Oakmont was initially planned as an “inland links.” Trees were not an issue during its first half century. But that changed following stinging criticism of the course in 1953 by respected golf writer Herbert Warren Wind. He termed Oakmont an “ugly old brute of a course.” The judgment resonated with the members, who then embarked on an aggressive tree planting program for the next three decades, to the point where, by the 1994 U.S. Open, Oakmont was densely tree-lined, with each hole encased in its narrow corridor of leafy canopies.', 'That started to change in the late 1990s, with the maintenance crew selectively peeling back trees in the earliest of morning, before anyone would notice. A decade and a half later the process accelerated so that by the 2016 U.S. Open, Oakmont was back to its original look: nearly treeless, except for one specimen American Elm on the far side of the golf course.', 'In 2023, Oakmont partially shut down in the spring and fall (while allowing play to proceed all summer under some restrictions) as it was treated to a complete, head-to-toe restoration by Gil Hanse and his partner Jim Wagner. Every green was expanded back out to its earlier shape.', 'The bunkers were all rebuilt, with the new arrangement of hazards conforming to what Hanse and Wagner could identify as the most characteristic of the Fownes era, 1903-47. Sometimes that meant conforming to 1938 imagery, other times to 1925 or even earlier. The total number of bunkers actually decreased slightly, to “only” 168 – which is still over nine per hole. But their size, position and variety were altered totally, with the average bunker having grown by one-third, from 1,474 sq. ft. to 1,964 sq. ft. That’s a lot of sand: 330,000 sq. ft. in total, or 7.6 acres worth. In some cases, strategic bunkers were moved downfield; in most cases the original strategic complexity of the multiple paths from tee to green were restored.', 'The course also got about 125 yards longer. And crucial for a course of Oakmont’s pedigree, the greens were restored to their original expanse, 8,100 square feet on average, about 20-percent larger than they had been before the restoration.', 'Oakmont once again sports its network of drainage ditches that the Fownes’ originally built into the course. They stretch alongside half the holes, totaling 1.1 miles in length, and pose a looming threat as lateral hazards immediately adjacent to fairway landing areas – mainly on drives, but also on the occasional approach shot or bail out from rough.', 'The additional greens surface area that Oakmont will present for the 2025 U.S. Open creates the potential for some precipitous hole locations that are closer to the edge of doom than ever before.', 'The slick putting surfaces here have always been a central element of Oakmont’s ferocity. Measurements from 1977 show that even then, the course measured 2 feet faster on average in terms of Stimpmeter speed than any tournament course in the country. At 9.8 then it outranked Augusta National by 2 feet. The measured mowing height of the Perennial poa annua greens surface is less than one-tenth of an inch – 0.84-inch, to be precise. To steel a quotation from legendary L.A. Dodgers announcer Vin Scully in describing a close play at first: “If you sliced beef that thin, you’d starve to death.”', 'Oakmont members and officials like their greens running very fast – allegedly, 14 to 15 on the Stimpmeter. The story goes that this is one of those clubs where USGA set-up officials slow down the course from normal play for a national championship.', 'A view of the 18th green during the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club. (David Cannon/Getty Images)', 'Compounding the complexity of these putting surfaces is that a number of them fall away from the line of play, making it very hard to get approach shots to stop on the surface – unless they have been landed short and run in. Players will notice right away at the long par-4 first and 10th holes this feature of a front to back slope. It is also the case on the long par-5 12th hole and the long par-4 15th.', 'On all these holes, the green surface follows the natural contour of land, which is itself a continuation of the long slope forming the fairway. And the issue here is that when you play a middle- or short-iron approach to a fallaway green, your stance on approach is itself downhill, which leads to a de-lofting of the iron, which in turn makes the shot fly at a lower-than normal trajectory – and thus harder to stop because it’s flighted lower (and stronger) than your standard shot with that club. Practice rounds will be important in mastering this part of Oakmont. To steal a quotation from 2006 U.S. Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, who is an unusually astute observer of golf architecture: “Gravity is the real enemy at Oakmont.”', 'Oakmont is unusual among top-ranked courses in the world in that its property is bisected by a major road – the multi-lane Pennsylvania Turnpike. The sunken roadbed, which isolates hole Nos. 2-8 from the rest of the property, requires access via two considerable pedestrian bridges of some 300-feet in span to carry golfers and spectators across.', 'The property offers ideal rolling land, with 70 feet of elevation change – all of it in play from tee to fallaway green on the long par-5 12th hole.', 'The fairways at Oakmont are not wide – 28-yards across on average, though the PGA TOUR-distance landing zones tend to get pinched and protected (or pocketed) by those gnarly bunkers. Miss the fairway and the rough is unforgiving – a 4- to 5-inch long thick mishmash of Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass and poa annua. This is not a course for “bomb and gouge,” because there is no way to control an approach shot muscled out of such thick rough onto greens like these that roll every which way down and out.', 'Also to be noted is the dual character of the par 4s. The five shortest holes (Nos. 2, 5, 11, 14 and 17) average only 369 yards long and have greens on the smaller side. By contrast, the seven longer par 4s (Nos. 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 15, 18) average 482 yards and have larger greens that tend to run away from the line of play. There’s no letup either way, but the shorter par 4s certainly are no picnic, though it will help players considerably here if they lay up off the tee for position with a wedge in to the greens.', 'In fact, there’s not a moment here at Oakmont where players can consider taking a breather. Not with only two par 5s, an average length 622 yards and tightly bunkered all the way. And certainly not with four par 3s that average 227 yards long.', 'No. 1, 488 yards, par 4: The alarm bells start ringing right away. The opening hole calls for a semi-blind drive to a fallaway fairway that provides no wiggle room for tee shots to land between nine looming bunkers. The hole tumbles 60 feet from tee to green, more than half of it on the approach shot alone – and to a green that further falls away another 4 feet from front to back. For the 1983 U.S. Open, this approach – and all the others – were heavily watered by a set-up team determined to make things impossible for players. (I know, because I caddied in that U.S. Open and watched the morning watering). The new USGA approach is more enlightened. They let a firm, tight surface (fairways cut at one-third of an inch, approaches cut at one-fifth of an inch) do the devil’s work.', 'No. 8, 289 yards, par 3: You think 289 is long for a par 3? For the 1953 U.S., the hole played 253 yards, which was longer than the average drive on TOUR that year. There’s an approach fairway here to land fairway woods on for run-up purposes, though this year Hanse has added a reef bunker spotted on a 1925 aerial that modestly reduced the landing zone. Expect at least once during the week that the hole will actually play over 300 yards – from to a back tee placement to wayback hole location. Somewhat facetiously, Paul Goydos once called this a hole where you could simultaneously hold a long-drive contest and play closest-to-the hole.', 'No. 17, 312 yards, par 4: Don’t be surprised if this hole is set up to play shorter than the eighth hole, at least in terms of yardage. The shortest par 4 at Oakmont, it is also the most exciting in terms of potential gain or loss. From the tee to green, the hole climbs 48 feet – the steepest on the course. But with sharp dogleg left, it can also be cut short – enough so that some players will drive it, only 305 guards from tee to green. The problem isn’t reaching the green; it’s staying on it. The putting surface is the smallest on the course, only 5,371 sq. ft. It is also convex (like an upside-down soup bowl) and vice-gripped by five very deep bunkers, the most conspicuous of which, front right, is known as “Big Mouth.” Hanse’s restoration opened up the front left approach area, thereby making it more tempting to play driver off the tee; as for a safe layup with an iron to the right. It then calls for a delicate shot over “Big Mouth” to a green that offers little depth or support for a wedge approach. This modest-looking hole will bring a wide variety of scores into play, from 2s to 7s.', 'View All News', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2025 PGA TOUR, Inc.

Bounce Back: Scottie Scheffler’s little-known superpower could win him U.S. Open,https://www.pgatour.com/article/news/latest/2025/06/09/scottie-scheffler-little-known-superpower-that-could-win-him-the-u-s-open-oakmont-major-championship-driver-swing,"['', '', 'Search', 'Menu', '', '', '', 'RBC Canadian Open ', '', '-18', '', '-18', '', '-17', '', '-16', '', '-16', '', '-15', '', '-15', '', '-15', '', '-14', '', '-14', '', '-14', '', '-14', '', '-13', '', '-13', '', '-13', '', '', '', '', '', '', '8 Min Read', 'Latest', '', '', '', 'Players on Scottie Scheffler’s mistake-free style of golf', 'A', 'Change Text Size', 'Scottie Scheffler’s lead was gone, and suddenly the PGA Championship coronation that appeared pre-ordained was slipping away.', ""Scheffler had just dropped another shot, this time at Quail Hollow Club's difficult par-4 ninth. He began Sunday three ahead, but now saw himself tied with a surging Jon Rahm entering a volatile back nine, a chance at major No. 3 slipping away."", 'Those stakes, with a major winner in hot pursuit, are enough for even the game’s best to falter. Scheffler has shown himself particularly adept at handling these exact turning points. He’s the best in the game at many things, but one that helped him win the PGA – and will be crucial to his chances at the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club – is what he did next.', 'Calmly walking to the par-5 10th tee, caddie Ted Scott joked that Scheffler should start aiming more right – he was missing most of his shots left on the front nine – which settled Scheffler’s mind as he pumped a tee shot down the middle. His approach landed around the green, and Scheffler got up-and-down for birdie to retake a lead he didn’t give up the rest of the way. In a vacuum, it was a simple birdie on a gettable par 5, but the larger context is emblematic of Scheffler’s brilliance: He bounced back. Again, a simple concept – but one Scheffler has mastered. He’s done it better than anyone over the last three years. At Quail Hollow, Scheffler was 7 under on holes immediately following a bogey.', 'Scheffler has a way of making the sport, one of the least predictable in the world, look scripted. “Video game golf,” as Ben Griffin coined it during the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday last month, the site of Scheffler’s latest triumph.', 'When Scheffler is rolling, he’s inescapable and unpreventable. To call it fate would be discounting the talent and mentality that fosters this air of inevitability. Scheffler is our video game protagonist – unkillable and unrelenting with a seemingly never-ending stock of lives. Make a mistake? No bother. He will have a chance to correct, and Scheffler does it immediately.', '', '', '', 'Players on Scottie Scheffler’s mistake-free style of golf', 'Here lies the tension this week at Oakmont – the final boss of championship venues. No venue has proven more difficult this century. Angel Cabrera won the 2007 U.S. Open at Oakmont at 5 over, a winning score that’s only been matched once in the last 50 years. The scoring average of +5.6 over-par is the highest of any U.S. Open venue since 2000. When the championship returned to Oakmont in 2016, it was considered to be as easy as it could play, given washout conditions during the week. Yet, Dustin Johnson won at 4 under. Every U.S. Open since has featured a lower winning score. Bogeys are inevitable here. How you bounce back and avoid compounding errors will be central to whoever emerges victorious. And Scheffler’s better than anyone else in the world at that.', 'It’s a little-talked-about reason that might just be the decider in this week’s U.S. Open. Let us explain.', 'Scheffler makes very few bogeys as it is. In 2025, he’s made the fewest on TOUR, carding a bogey on just 10% of the holes he played. He finished second in bogey avoidance in 2024 and led the TOUR in the stat in 2022-2023. But when Scheffler does make a mistake, he hardly ever compounds it. Quite the opposite.', 'He’s better than anyone at getting the stroke right back. Scheffler leads the TOUR in what’s known as “Bounce Back,” the percentage of time a golfer makes a birdie or better immediately after a bogey or worse. Scheffler’s Bounce-Back percentage is 35.80%. In other words, more than a third of the time that Scheffler bogeys a hole, he birdies the next. His normal birdie rate is 25.90%, meaning he’s 10% more likely to make a birdie if he has bogeyed the previous hole. At the PGA Championship, Scheffler’s Bounce-Back rate was 60%. Only five times this season has Scheffler carded back-to-back bogeys.', ""“Just bogey the holes before the easy holes, I guess,” Scheffler said, laughing, when asked about the stat. “Going back to junior golf, I think I didn't handle things as good as I could have, and I feel like I've always battled to handle things the best way I can."", '""I\'m going to make plenty of mistakes over a 72-hole tournament, but it\'s more important for me not to let the mistakes bug me and to continue to bounce back and keep fighting out there. I mean, I feel like my attitude has gotten better over the years, and I feel like that\'s why that statistic would be, I guess, one of my stronger ones.”', 'On holes after a bogey, Scheffler makes more birdies than his average and hits more fairways and greens than his average. Scheffler has hit 64.5% of his fairways this season. He’s hitting 73.5% of his fairways on holes after bogeys. He’s hitting 76.5% of his greens on bounce-back opportunities, up from his overall average of 70.25%.', 'This is a modal window.', '', '', 'Scottie Scheffler bounces back after double bogey with birdie at the Memorial', 'That Scheffler somehow becomes better after making a bogey is a stat that seems shocking until you realize it’s a perfect capsule of what makes Scheffler great – a confoundingly elite mix of talent and mentality.', 'With a home-grown swing that emphasizes using his athleticism, rather than swinging perfectly on plane, Scheffler is quickly able to snap back into form and focus. His swing could feel off, as it did through nine holes at the PGA Championship, but it doesn’t take long to self-correct.', ""“I'm not going to sit here and say that I've ever had the kind of ball-striking or consistency that he's had,” said three-time major winner Jordan Spieth. “What impresses me the most is his club face control is elite. It's maybe the best there's ever been as far as club face control. So his consistency is ridiculous."", ""“Then that just leads to his distance control being phenomenal,” Spieth continued. “There's a shot in and the worst he's going to do is 15 feet, and most guys are going to hit a good (one) there, but for him that was, like, the worst shot. … So it's elite consistency, and it's because of his tempo and club face control yields these kind of results.”"", 'Moreover, what elevates Scheffler in these moments is what Shane Lowry said is mentality. Scheffler admits bogeys actually sharpen his focus, which can wane over the slog of 72 holes of competitive stroke play. Like a boxer, a quick punch to the face can re-center him to the task at hand. It emboldens the competitive fire in him, driving him to stop any negative momentum. It doesn’t push him to be more aggressive in rectifying his mistakes, it just forces him to hone back in on his process, take it one shot at a time and block out what others are doing around him – all the cliches that don’t make headlines but lead to his success.', '“He plays the right shot at the right time, over and over and over again,” said Rory McIlroy, who admitted earlier this year he was trying to play like Scheffler in that way, prioritizing patience and avoiding compounding errors.', 'When Scheffler caught a mudball and made double-bogey at Quail Hollow’s brutal 16th during the first round of the PGA, he didn’t technically bounce back. But pars at 17 and 18 – the closing parts of the treacherous ""Green Mile"" – felt like birdies and kept his round from spiraling out of control. He hit both greens. For the tournament, he hit 90% of his greens on bounce-back opportunities.', 'Scheffler bogeyed the 10th hole during the final round of the Memorial, his lone dropped shot of the weekend, which cut his lead to just one shot. You can guess what he did next. He birdied the 11th, extended his lead to two shots and eventually won by four strokes. His Bounce-Back rate was 80%. Only three other golfers had a rate of 50% or above.', '“He doesn’t make big mistakes,” said Shane Lowry. “We all have tendencies to make big mistakes, and he’s got one of the best golfing brains that I’ve ever seen.”', 'How will Scheffler’s brain attack and cope with Oakmont, which will land its fair share of jabs no matter how well Scheffler is playing?', 'In 2007 at Oakmont, there were 60 rounds in the 80s (reminder that Oakmont is only a par 70) and just eight under-par rounds. The winner, Cabrera, made 18 bogeys for the week. The field made a total of 2318 bogeys, 381 double bogeys and 64 triple bogeys or worse. No holes played under par.', 'Scheffler struggled to adjust to last year’s U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and the unpredictable lies off the fairway. A miss off the tee could lead to a perfect lie in the waste area or a totally screwed shot against a tuft of wiregrass. That messed with Scheffler, who prides himself on knowing where the optimal miss is.', 'Oakmont will punish players differently. The course is right in front of the players. There are no tricks or gimmicks. It’s brutally difficult, but it’s not unpredictable or unfair. Who better to believe in than the man who makes bogeys at the lowest rate and bounces back at the highest?', 'Amidst the carnage of this year’s U.S. Open, remember this: Scheffler has all the cheat codes.', 'View All News', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2025 PGA TOUR, Inc.

The U.S. Open could be a pivotal data point in the PGA TOUR Player of the Year race between Scheffler and McIlroy, and it’s another opportunity for Scheffler to move one step closer to the career Grand Slam – which McIlroy achieved in emotional fashion at this year’s Masters.', 'A strong week at Oakmont would benefit those on the bubble for a Ryder Cup spot, as the American and European teams begin to take shape in advance of this fall’s matches at Bethpage Black. There’s also the matter of the FedExCup Playoffs – as just 10 events remain before the 70-player starting field is finalized. With a newly introduced format where all 30 TOUR Championship qualifiers will start the FedExCup Playoffs finale at even par, it’s as true as ever that all FedExCup Playoffs qualifiers will have a legitimate chance to win the FedExCup.', 'In the meantime, the golf world turns its gaze to western Pennsylvania and the season’s third major championship on a historic venue where par is usually a pretty good score. The rough is thick and the greens are slick. Would you expect anything different?', 'Here’s everything you need to know for the 125th U.S. Open.', 'FIELD NOTES: World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler arrives at Oakmont on the strength of three wins in his last four starts – an eight-stroke triumph at THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson, a five-shot win at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, and a four-shot win at the Memorial Tournament presented by Workday. The three-time major winner is still seeking his first U.S. Open title; he has notched three top 10s in seven starts at his national open. … World No. 2 Rory McIlroy struggled mightily at last week’s RBC Canadian Open, missing the cut by 12 shots with rounds of 71-78, and he intended to fine-tune his driver (and perhaps switch drivers) over the weekend leading into the U.S. Open. McIlroy has notched six straight top-10 finishes at the U.S. Open after missing three straight cuts from 2016-18; he has credited the addition of the RBC Canadian Open to his schedule (the week before the U.S. Open) to his uptick in results. McIlroy, who won the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional, finished runner-up to Bryson DeChambeau a year ago at Pinehurst No. 2. DeChambeau will defend his title this week. … Ryan Fox qualified for the U.S. Open in last-minute fashion, winning the RBC Canadian Open in a playoff over Sam Burns to move inside the top 60 on the Official World Golf Ranking and punch his ticket to Oakmont. … A bulk of the U.S. Open field is composed of players who advance through 36-hole Final Qualifying, otherwise known as ""Golf’s Longest Day."" Ten of 13 Final Qualifying sites were contested June 2, with the first three played May 19. Notables to advance through Final Qualifying included Cameron Young (who survived a 5-for-1 playoff in Columbus, Ohio, that included Max Homa, Rickie Fowler and Eric Cole), two-time TOUR winner Erik van Rooyen, TOUR veterans like Justin Lower and Mark Hubbard, former 35-year-old Bud Cauley who fulfilled a TOUR medical extension earlier this year to complete an inspiring comeback after being sidelined for three-plus years due to injuries stemming from a car crash, 17-year-old high school junior Mason Howell, and Indiana dentist Matt Vogt. … This marks the final U.S. Open into which Phil Mickelson is exempt via his win at the 2021 PGA Championship. Mickelson has completed three legs of the career Grand Slam, but a U.S. Open title eludes him. He has notched six career runner-up finishes at the U.S. Open.', 'SIGNATURE EVENT STORYLINES: The Aon Next 10 for the Travelers Championship will be finalized after the U.S. Open. The Aon Swing 5 for the Travelers is comprised of top FedExCup points earners, not otherwise exempt, across the ONEflight Myrtle Beach Classic, Charles Schwab Challenge and RBC Canadian Open. The Aon Swing 5 for the Travelers currently consists of Matti Schmid, Kevin Yu, Bud Cauley, Mackenzie Hughes and Harry Hall. Although the events for the Aon Swing 5 have been completed, the qualifiers are not yet finalized, as Ryan Fox (currently No. 9 on the Aon Next 10) could conceivably be bumped from the Aon Next 10 and into the Aon Swing 5, which would remove Hall from the Aon Swing 5.', 'COMCAST BUSINESS TOUR TOP 10 UPDATES: The top nine spots on the TOUR TOP 10 remained unchanged at the RBC Canadian Open. Both of this season’s three-time winners, Scheffler and McIlroy, hold the top two spots on the TOUR TOP 10, respectively, into the U.S. Open. Sepp Straka, a two-time winner this season, holds the No. 3 spot. He’s followed by a quintet of Americans in Justin Thomas, Ben Griffin, Russell Henley, Andrew Novak and Maverick McNealy, respectively, with just 10 events remaining before the FedExCup Playoffs. Canada’s Corey Conners is No. 9, with Sweden’s Ludvig Åberg jumping one spot to No. 10 with a T13 at the RBC Canadian Open; Harris English fell from No. 10 to No. 12. The TOUR TOP 10 emphasizes player performance by rewarding the top 10 finishers in the FedExCup Regular Season standings (finalized after the Wyndham Championship), offering a shared $40 million total in bonus money.', 'FEDEXCUP: Winner receives 750 FedExCup points.', 'COURSE: Oakmont Country Club, par 70, 7,372 yards. This will mark the 10th U.S. Open contested at Oakmont, the most of any host club. The 1903 Henry Fownes design is a staple on the U.S. Open rotation and sometimes described as the most difficult golf course in the United States (maybe hyperbole, maybe not). Fownes spent a year building the course on former farmland adjacent to the Allegheny River Valley; the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which was constructed in the late 1940s, passes through part of the course. It was the only course designed by Fownes, a Pittsburgh steel magnate. Oakmont, which was the United States’ first golf course to be recognized as a National Historic Landmark, recently underwent a bunker restoration project with Gil Hanse. Its wild bunkers are the stuff of legend, notably the “Church Pew” bunker that straddles the third and fourth holes. Oakmont was originally conceptualized as an “inland links,” then became densely tree-lined by the 1990s before returning to its treeless look for the 2016 U.S. Open. There’s plenty of history here, and players relish it – even if the challenge can be overwhelming at times.', 'Dustin Johnson won the last U.S. Open contested at Oakmont in 2016 with a winning score of 4-under 276. That’s also the lowest 72-hole total score in a U.S. Open at Oakmont to date.', '72-HOLE RECORD: 268, Rory McIlroy (2011 at Congressional Country Club)', '18-HOLE RECORD: 62, Rickie Fowler (Round 1, 2023 at Los Angeles Country Club), Xander Schauffele (Round 1, 2023 at Los Angeles Country Club)', 'LAST TIME: A year ago, DeChambeau earned his second U.S. Open title at Pinehurst No. 2, saving par from a greenside bunker at the 72nd hole to post 6 under, one stroke clear of McIlroy, who missed two short putts down the stretch, including a slippery 4-footer for par at the 72nd hole. Patrick Cantlay and Tony Finau shared third place at 4 under, with Matthieu Pavon in solo fifth at 3 under. It looked to be a breaking point in McIlroy’s decade-long chase to earn his fifth major title, the most crushing of several close calls in recent years, and his exasperated face in the scoring area told the story. Revisiting that heartbreak could have been a central storyline in the lead-up to this year’s U.S. Open, but McIlroy made amends at this year’s Masters to complete the career Grand Slam and notch that long-awaited fifth major. Thankfully for McIlroy, he’ll no longer field questions about the major drought.', 'NOTE: The USGA, who owns and operates the U.S. Open, controls all digital streaming and broadcast rights to this event.

As well as the greens, every U.S. Open build-up fascinates around the rough and its length. Rough here at Oakmont has been described as treacherous and expect tough, non-graduated rough along the fairways. In essence there’s a semi cut of around 1.5 yards before balls hits the genuine 5 inch long grass.', 'Oakmont contains the longest par-3 in U.S. Open history with the 8th playing 289 yards. It also includes two +600 yard, par-5s.Freshly extended to 7,372 yards by the Hanse and Wagner restoration which was unveiled in 2024, this is a long Par 70, but this won’t be a Major Championship dictated by the length of the course.', 'Oakmont Country Club, Oakmont, Pennsylvania: Designer: Henry Fownes 1903 with Tom Fazio re-design 2006; Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner Renovation 2023; Course Type: Classical, Technical, Long; Par: 70; Length: 7,372 yards; Holes with Water Hazards: 0; Number of Sand Bunkers: 168; Acres of Fairway: 27; Fairways: Bentgrass with Poa Annua; Rough: Kentucky Bluegrass with Perennial Ryegrass and Poa Annua 5+”; Greens: 8,500 sq.ft average featuring Poa Annua; Tournament Stimp: 13-14ft.', 'Oakmont Country Club Fairway Widths (yards): Below are the fairway widths for Oakmont and how they compare to recent courses that we’ve seen on Tour:', 'Course Designer Links: For research purposes other Gil Hanse PGA Tour designs are listed below:', 'Course Overview: Oakmont Country Club will undoubtedly be a stern test in 2025 in its lengthened guise. At 7,372 yards – up circa 150 yards from 2016 – it’s obvious that in today’s modern game the course’s defence is not overall length.', 'Oakmont is defended by clever course design which includes the fastest Poa Annua putting surfaces on the circuit, severely canted green complexes with extreme false fronts, 170 bunkers of the deep variety, sloping fairways, a number of blind or semi-blind tee-shots, and traditional US Open-style Kentucky Bluegrass with Perennial Ryegrass and Poa Annua rough – 5 inches in length.', 'Another aspect of the course which deserves note is its tactical usage of length. Oakmont contains the longest par-3 in U.S. Open history with the 8th playing 289 yards. At its maximum this hole is on the edge of the shorter players’ driving distance ranges. It also includes two +600 yard, par-5s. It will be interesting to see if Rory or Bryson or Min Woo can even attempt to reach in two.', '170-odd bunkers add bite and it’s interesting that one of the few changes from 2016 is the fact that rough has been reduced around those bunkers to maximise the number of captures.', 'Gil Hanse has made the bunkering even more difficult – Oakmont is famous for its Church Pews bunker set between Holes 3 and 4 – with fairway bunkers now getting on for an automatic 1 shot penalty. Oakmont is also known for ditches which criss-cross the property. In 2016 the USGA carved out those ditches to where players could get in there and play. In 2025 that won’t be the case with 12 to 18 inch high native grasses making recovery shots a nightmare.', 'Other changes to note that will ratchet-up the difficulty include the rough. We always discuss the length of the rough at each and every U.S. Open, and in recent years we have seen graduated rough in-play to alleviate the concerns of the players. That won’t be the case at Oakmont in 2025. The wet Pennsylvania spring has made it particularly thick, with the USGA topping it off at five inches – it will be higher as the championship progresses.', 'Key areas of change from the Gil Hanse renovation include the addition of more than 24,000 square feet of green surface, so greens are 8,500 sq.ft on average featuring fast Poa Annua.', 'Encouraged by a vocal club membership who are well known to want their course to play as difficult as possible, Hanse’s work has made the notoriously fast greens even harder. Expect far more pin locations and as Grounds Superintendent Mike McCormick says, “The greens are the No. 1 defence on the course. Oakmont, in today’s world, it’s not a crazy-long golf course. There are several holes out here where the players will be hitting wedges into and it puts even more of an emphasis on the greens.”', '', 'US Open Winners: 2024: Bryson DeChambeau (-6); 2023: Wyndham Clark (-10); 2022: Matt Fitzpatrick (-6); 2021: John Rahm (-6); 2020: Bryson DeChambeau (-6); 2019: Gary Woodland (-13); 2018: Brooks Koepka (+1); 2017: Brooks Koepka (-16); 2016: Dustin Johnson (-4); 2015: Jordan Spieth (-5); 2014: Martin Kaymer (-9); 2013: Justin Rose (+1); 2012: Webb Simpson (+1); 2011: Rory McIlroy (-16); 2010: Graeme McDowell (E); 2009: Lucas Glover (-4).', 'OWGR of U.S. Open Winners: 2024: DeChambeau 38; 2023: Clark 32; 2022: Fitzpatrick 18; 2021: Rahm 3; 2020: DeChambeau 9; 2019: Woodland 24; 2018: Koepka 9; 2017: Koepka 22.', 'Datagolf Ranking U.S. Open Winners: 2024: DeChambeau 10; 2023: Clark 11; 2022: Fitzpatrick 10; 2021: Rahm 1; 2020: DeChambeau 12; 2019 Woodland 20.', 'Path to Victory: Below are end of round positions for the winners of the US Open since 2010:', 'Shots From the Lead: Below are the US Open winners since 2010 and where they were positioned in terms of shots from the lead during the tournament:', 'Incoming Form of U.S. Open winners since 2010:', 'Stats: We’ve published some key player statistics for this week’s event that are well worth a look.

Over 40 mm – approaching 2 inches – fell over the weekend, with more forecast on Monday, so the course is lush, the fairways will be soft and the rough will be long.

This is one place you really need to control your golf ball. You’ve got to control your spin and where you want the ball to land, so obviously, it’s a premium to hit the fairways because the rough’s thick and deep. You can get a decent lie every once in a while, but the majority of them, they sit down, and it’s tough to control it. And then the fairway bunkers are almost a penalty stroke too because they’re so deep, and the ball, you never really get that good of a lie. So I really think it’s important to hit the fairways here.', 'My bag doesn’t really change no matter what course I’m playing. I put a 2 iron in every once in a while, and I’ll take a wedge out. But this week, I’m going to play a 2 iron and just three wedges. Sometimes I go just driver, 3 wood, 3 iron, and then four wedges, just depending on the course. But this week, I do have a 2 iron in.', 'The greens. They’re so hard to putt. No matter how close you are to the hole, it’s just, they’re tough to putt. I mean, I hit so many good putts today that I thought were going in, and burned the edge or lip out. But that’s just how it goes. I mean, these greens are tough.', 'You’ve just got to hit the fairway on 15 and 18. Then 16 is a really tough par 3. And then 17, you know, it’s a short par 4, but it’s difficult. You’ve just got to kind of wherever the flag is, you’ve got to kind of have a game plan and stick to it. Today, with the back flag, I went for it and hit it in the right bunker, hit a great, you know, hit a good bunker shot. Got to eight feet, just short of it, which was fine, and lifted out from there. This morning, the pin was on the front just over the bunker and I laid up. So it just depends on how I’m feeling, which way the wind’s blowing. Just all depends.”', 'Phil Mickelson (2016): “The reason why I’m optimistic about Oakmont is that it doesn’t require me to hit a lot of drivers. It requires me to get the ball in play off the tee, but when I’m not hitting drivers, if I’m hitting 3-woods, hybrids, I feel confident I’m able to do that a fairly high percentage of the time. I really think it is the hardest golf course we’ve ever played. A lot of golf courses, when it challenges you tee to green the way Oakmont does, it usually has a little bit of a reprieve on the greens, and you really don’t at Oakmont. They’re some of the most undulating, fast, difficult greens to putt. It really is the hardest golf course I think we’ve played.”', 'Jordan Spieth (2016): “It’s going to take an extreme amount of patience and discipline off the tee. A lot of people talk about Oakmont’s greens but the most important thing I think for this year’s U.S. Open will be driving the golf ball. You don’t have to hit it very far. It will be helpful to hit it far and straight as it is anywhere, but you are going to have discipline to take iron off the tee, knowing you can hit 3-wood and still be ok. You just have to give yourself shots out of the fairway into a lot of these greens, given they slope front to back with false fronts. So you have to be coming out of the fairway with the right amount of spin. Your depth is thrown out on a lot of these holes because it’s well bunkered. Whether it’s an approach shot or a tee shot, there are some bunkers that you think are green-side, or you think you can fly them and actually it’s completely the opposite.”', 'First Round Leader Analysis: First round leader(s), their wave and winning score since 2010. Full First Round Leader stats are here.', 'For the record, here’s the breakdown of pure Poa Annua and Bentgrass/Poa Annua mix PGA Tour victors in the field since 2008:', 'Recent U.S. Open history features a new breed of champions with first-time Major winners galore. Indeed, going back to 2009, 12 of the last 16 champions had never captured a Major title. So for me it’s interesting to look at the prices of first-time Major winners going back to Danny Willett wining the 2016 Masters:', 'Overall it’s well worth noting that the average price for U.S. Open winners for the past 5 renewals is 30/1. Jordon Spieth won at 9/1 in 2015, fresh from a Masters win, and since then the winning prices have been 16/1 (2016 – Johnson), 45/1 (2017 – Koepka), 25/1 (2018 – Koepka), 80/1 (2019 – Woodland), 25/1 (2020 – DeChambeau), 10/1 (2021 – Rahm), 25/1 (2022 – Fitzpatrick), 66/1 (2023 – Clark) and 20/1 (2024 – DeChambeau).', 'Take the Wyndham Clark win out of the equation and that average odds price falls to 20/1, highlighting that we should expect a quality winner this week at Oakmont, where Dustin Johnson was 16/1 in 2016.', 'BRYSON DECHAMBEAU 4PTS WIN ONLY 15/2 WITH BETFRED', 'You have to pick a lane this week at the U.S. Open. World Number 1 Scottie Scheffler is the kind of short price we have only seen in golf betting for the likes of Tiger Woods for Majors. His chances are obvious and his game seems perfectly suited to the demands of Oakmont Country Club. He’s the right price and the obvious winner-in-waiting.', 'But let’s to try to get him beat. The most obvious rival for Scheffler is defending champion Bryson DeChambeau. Like him or loathe him, DeChambeau is good for golf and it’s a crying shame that we don’t see the likes of DeChambeau, Rahm and Niemann playing more regularly with Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele. These 6 are the very best in the game right now.', 'From a Major Championship rota perspective, of the US-based Majors it’s crystal clear that the U.S. Open is the most suited to the 31 year-old Californian. Slowly but surely getting his head around Augusta National – 6th (2024) and 5th (2025) – long, parkland, classical golf courses are where DeChambeau is really in his element. The 2020 (Winged Foot) and 2024 (Pinehurst Number 2) U.S. Open Champion, DeChambeau’s record at the PGA of America-organised PGA Championship is not too shabby either. 4th (2020 TPC Harding Park), 4th (2023 Oak Hill), 2nd (2024 Valhalla) and 2nd (2025 Quail Hollow) is top-notch. Soft fairways and damp rough early doors will only suit Bryson’s power even further in my opinion.', 'A 12-time PGA Tour / LIV Tour winner, 10 of which have been on greens that have featured Bentgrass or Bentgrass Poa Annua mix, DeChambeau also has a stellar record in these geographical climes. 9 of his professional wins have come in Illinois (x2), New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio (x2) and West Virginia. Those wins were the 2016 DAP Championship (Korn Ferry), 2017 John Deere Classic, 2018 Memorial Tournament, 2018 Northern Trust, 2018 Dell Technologies Championship, 2020 Rocket Mortgage Classic, 2020 U.S. Open, 2023 LIV Greenbrier and 2023 LIV Chicago.', '✅ New UK customers: Bet £10 Get £50 in free bets for new customers using code BETFRED50 and this qualifying link\n✅ For further details read our Betfred promo code> page\n✅ Odds compiler takes a different view of many events meaning value can be found\n✅ Flexible each-way terms available with 5, 7, 8 and 10 place options to choose from', 'Betfred New Customer Offer: New customers only.

Of the big names on the PGA Tour, Rory McIlroy has gone into the standard post-Green Jacket winning slump, Xander Schauffele is nowhere near the player we saw in the summer of 2024, and Collin Morikawa is just as likely to finish 50th as he is to contend for the full 72 holes. Ludvig Aberg hardly inspires either, throwing in one quad and 4 double bogeys in his last 8 rounds – hardly ideal for Oakmont. The fact that Scheffler’s nearest challenger when he won at the Memorial Tournament was Ben Griffin highlights how badly many of the best on the PGA Tour are playing currently.', 'Rahm though seems to be on the up. 7th at the 2024 Open Championship, 14th at The Masters and 8th at the PGA Championship across his past 3 Majors is positive. The PGA Championship is actually a great point to raise as Rahm at the start of the back-9 got to within a shot of Scheffler and was the only player putting the Texan under pressure. When Scottie birdied 14 and 15, Rahm showed his elite mentality by not settling for runner-up, instead going for broke – the win was all important to the 30 year-old Spaniard. Yes he undoubtedly ‘bust’ on the final 3 holes, but you have to admire the fact that he went for the win. Hidden away on LIV – yes it was his decision – I get the feeling he wants to prove a point at the moment and that could be the difference this week.', 'A month down the road and I genuinely think that Oakmont will suit the Datagolf Ranked Number 4 far more than Quail Hollow. A glance at my Poa Annua and Bentgrass/Poa Annua PGA Tour victors in the field list (in the article above) highlights that Rahm has 5. Only Dustin Johnson has more (11) and he wasn’t too bad around Oakmont in 2016!', '8th last week at LIV Virginia played on Robert Trent Jones Golf Club which featured Poa Annua within the greens. Jon ranked 6th for Driving Distance, 16th for Driving Accuracy, 3rd for Greens in Regulation, 4th for Total Driving, 8th for Total Accuracy and 2nd for Ball Striking.', 'He was also the low amateur here at Oakmont in 2016 – finishing 23rd. Starting with a Thursday 76, Rahm proceeded to shoot 69-72-70 for a +1/211 final 54-hole total, which was T9 in the field and just 2 shots behind Dustin Johnson.', '✅ New UK customers: Bet £10 Get £50 in free bets for new customers using code BETFRED50 and this qualifying link\n✅ For further details read our Betfred promo code> page\n✅ Odds compiler takes a different view of many events meaning value can be found\n✅ Flexible each-way terms available with 5, 7, 8 and 10 place options to choose from', 'Betfred New Customer Offer: New customers only.

The winner last week at LIV Virginia played at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, he played some super golf. With both Jon Rahm and latterly Bryson DeChambeau more than present in contention on Sunday afternoon, Niemann shot a superb -8/63 to take the title. It’s easy to overlook LIV Golf League victories, but this was his 6th in total and interestingly his first in the United States.', 'Joaquin knows how to win – indeed this was his 8th professional title in his last 35 starts (23% success rate). Take a shorter snapshot and the 26 year-old Chilean has won 5 of his last 12 starts (42% success rate) going back to the Saudi International in December 2024. Yes it’s undoubtedly at a lower level, but Niemann is a super-elite talent – no question.', 'It’s also more than clear to see that Joaquin is starting to feel more comfortable in Majors. 29th at The Masters and a breakthrough 8th at the Quail Hollow hosted PGA Championship highlight real progress at the top level.', 'The location and make-up of some of his victories also supports the fact that Oakmont could suit. Pennsylvania borders West Virginia, where Niemann landed his maiden PGA Tour title at the 2019 A Military Tribute at Greenbrier played at TPC Old White. 2007 Oakmont winner Angel Cabrera won the same tournament in 2014. Joaquin then pulled off a huge victory at the loaded 2022 Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club. 2016 Oakmont winner Dustin Johnson has a superb record around “Hogan’s Alley” – a stretching, difficult, classical course that features Bentgrass/Poa Annua greens. It’s also noticeable that the Chilean’s most recent wins on the LIV Golf League have come on a couple of courses in Chapultepec (Mexico City) and RTJGC (Virginia) that feature Poa Annua grassed-greens.', 'Ranking 4th in my published Predictor Model, he’s undoubtedly long enough and consistent enough with his iron play to contend in a U.S. Open and Niemann ticks the box when it comes to the fact that 5 of the last 6 U.S. Open winners (excludes Wyndham Clark) finished in the top 8 at the previous PGA Championship.', '✅ Bet £10 get £30 in free bets for new customers\n✅ Bonus code SPORT30 can be used, but does not change the offer amount in any way\n✅ For further details read our bet365 new customer offer page\n✅ Early odds available each week on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour\n✅ ‘Each Way Extra’ promotion where you can choose between 3, 8, 10 or 12 places each way\n\nbet365 New Customer Offer: Bet £10 & Get £30 in Free Bets for new customers at bet365.

G-Mac was 80/1, Simpson (2012) was 80/1, Kaymer (2014) was 40/1, Koepka (2017) was 45/1 and Gary Woodland as recently as 2019 was an 80/1 chance backed at the time by my Golf Betting System podcast colleague Barry O’Hanrahan. 2023 also saw Wyndham Clark win at 66/1. I know in this world of Scottie Scheffler it feels remote, but longer mid-prices can and do win the U.S. Open.', 'In Sepp Straka we have a player who has really stepped up to world elite level in 2025. A winner of The American Express in January, the University of Georgia graduate, who moved from Austria to Georgia when he was 14, has already become a lynchpin of Luke Donald’s Team Europe Ryder Cup squad, with his consistent high-level of play on the PGA Tour. 7th at Pebble Beach, 5th at Bay Hill, 14th at TPC Sawgrass and 1st at Philadelphia Cricket Club highlights a player who has been more than comfortable at Signature event level on the PGA Tour. Naturally his Truist Championship win was the biggest of his career to date.', 'This preceded 3rd on his last outing at Jack Nicklaus’ Memorial Tournament. Naturally Scottie Scheffler took all the plaudits, as did Ben Griffin who was the World Number 1’s biggest threat throughout. But 32 year-old Straka played very nicely. His -8/136 Final 36 Hole total was best in the field and 2 shots better than Scheffler. His -7/209 Final 54 Hole total was second – by a single shot – to Scottie and 2 shots clear of anybody else in the field.', '1st for Driving Accuracy, 10th for Greens in Regulation, 9th for Total Driving, 8th for Ball Striking and 1st for All-Round in old money equated in Strokes Gained parlance to 1st for Off the Tee, 15th for Approach, 7th for Tee to Green, and intriguingly 3rd for Putting, given Oakmont’s fearsome greens.', '7th at the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill in New York State and 2nd at the 2023 Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, I think Sepp has a super chance of mixing it at Oakmont this week.', '✅ Bet £10 get £30 in free bets for new customers\n✅ Bonus code SPORT30 can be used, but does not change the offer amount in any way\n✅ For further details read our bet365 new customer offer page\n✅ Early odds available each week on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour\n✅ ‘Each Way Extra’ promotion where you can choose between 3, 8, 10 or 12 places each way\n\nbet365 New Customer Offer: Bet £10 & Get £30 in Free Bets for new customers at bet365.

He’s no superstar we know that, but the sort who resides outside of the glare of the golf media who can really play. A U.S. Open Average Score of 71.81 ranks him above the likes of Justin Thomas, Joaquin Niemann, Shane Lowry, Russell Henley, Jordan Spieth, Tyrrell Hatton, Justin Rose, Jason Day, Corey Conners and Keegan Bradley – many of whom are way shorter in this week’s betting market. 4th at Winged Foot (2020) which is a superb comp course, 3rd at Torrey Pines (2021) and 8th at Los Angeles Country Club (2023), Harris has undoubtedly mixed it on recent U.S. Open assignments.
