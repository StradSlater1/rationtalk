Potential AFC under-the-radar stars in 2025: One player from each team who could make a surprising impact,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/potential-afc-under-the-radar-stars-in-2025-one-player-from-each-team-who-could-make-a-surprising-impact/,"['', ""Offseason workouts are in full swing across the NFL. Teams are wrapping up OTAs and opening up minicamp before they head out for one last summer break before reconvening for training camp in late July. And then it's full speed ahead toward the regular season. "", ""Of course, these workouts are pieces to the foundation that these teams are beginning to lay down, and it allows us to take a look at the roster and give our educated analysis for who we think could shine in 2025. In that spirit, we're going to identify one player on each team in the AFC who we believe is flying a bit under the radar at the moment, but could burst onto the scene this season and blossom into a key contributor for his franchise. A sleeper, if you will. "", ""Ready? Let's get to it!"", 'With Khalil Shakir inking a four-year extension this offseason and the Bills signing Josh Palmer in free agency, folks may be forgetting Coleman. The 2024 second-round pick had a solid rookie season but is primed to break out in 2025. While the Bills added Palmer, they also let fellow wideout Mack Hollins leave in free agency, which opens the door for Coleman to adopt some of his 50 targets from last season, adding to what should be a growing amount of volume from Josh Allen. Coleman showed his big-play ability, averaging 19.2 yards per reception last season. Given that Allen has one of the best arms in the NFL, this duo could make some serious splashes.', ""Miami selected Wright in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Tennessee and he is currently in line to be the No. 2 running back behind starter De'Von Achane. That's a pretty advantageous spot given Achane's durability concerns, so Wright could see starting reps at some point this season. Even if Achane remains healthy, however, Mike McDaniel's offense has proven that it can have multiple running backs produce at a high level. During Achane's rookie season, when he totaled 997 yards from scrimmage and 11 touchdowns, Raheem Mostert (who is no longer with the team) had 1,187 total yards and 21 touchdowns. It's not out of the realm of possibility that Wright flirts with Achane's rookie numbers and comes close to 1,000 scrimmage yards."", ""When New York selected Corley in the third round in 2024 out of Western Kentucky, there was plenty of buzz. However, that buzz never materialized into an on-field impact in what was a forgettable rookie season, which was headlined by mental mistakes like letting go of the ball before crossing the end zone against Houston. That said, Corley does have an opportunity for redemption and to get his career off the ground, especially with a new coaching staff in town. The Jets also don't have the deepest receiver room behind Garrett Wilson, so there is an opportunity to climb the depth chart if he can endear himself to Aaron Glenn and Co."", ""Despite signing a three-year, $43.5 million deal with the Patriots in March, Landry has sort of been lost in the shuffle of New England's busy offseason. However, his addition shouldn't be overlooked. New England was dead last in the NFL in sacks in 2024 and had the fourth-lowest pressure rate. Landry comes to Foxborough with a prior history working under coach Mike Vrabel due to their shared time with the Tennessee Titans. Vrabel was at the helm when Landry posted a 12-sack season in 2021, and it wouldn't be surprising to see him reach that Pro Bowl level this year with his new squad. "", 'For a six-week stretch during the 2023 season, Mitchell was a lightning rod. The back averaged 8.4 yards per rush and 10.5 yards per reception. However, that run ended when he suffered a torn ACL that also put a dent in his 2024 campaign. Now, Mitchell is back healthy and noted recently that he feels ""like I\'m back better than when I first got"" to Baltimore. Of course, Derrick Henry will carry the bulk of the work out of the Ravens backfield, but Mitchell could prove to be a change-of-pace option with home run ability for what is already one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL. ', ""Wilson, a third-round pick in 2024 out of NC State, was quite productive during his rookie season. He totaled 78 tackles over 17 games, but only started four games for Pittsburgh and played 45% of the defensive snaps. That's about to change in 2025. With Elandon Roberts departing this offseason, there is a starting spot open for Wilson to ascend opposite Patrick Queen. If Wilson fends off Malik Harrison and Cole Holcomb this summer, he could be in a position where he's among the top tacklers in the NFL. "", 'The Bengals selected Murphy with the 28th overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, but that pick has yet to truly provide dividends. The defensive end posted just three sacks during his rookie season and zero over 13 games played in 2024. Yuck. However, Murphy is slated to replace Sam Hubbard, who retired this offseason, giving him more opportunity to make an impact. And his possible Year 3 breakout would be a welcome sight for Cincinnati, especially with the uncertain status of Trey Hendrickson. ', ""Of course, Cleveland's quarterback situation still needs to be sorted out with an array of options on the roster. That said, there is an interesting collection of pass catches within the Browns offense, including Tillman. The 2023 third-round pick should start opposite Jerry Jeudy and, even as Cleveland deploys two tight end sets, he should still see the field quite a bit. At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, Tillman is an athletic, big-bodied receiver who has the tools to break out. "", ""Yes, the Texans have Nico Collins atop the depth chart and double dipped at the receiver position in the NFL Draft, but don't forget about Kirk. The former Jaguars wideout was traded to Houston this offseason and should be a key factor in the target share from C.J. Stroud. The 28-year-old was limited to eight games last season due to a broken collarbone, but looks to be all systems go for the 2025 season. When healthy, Kirk has proven to be a crisp route runner and a dangerous deep threat, giving him a pretty high ceiling as he now joins the Texans. "", 'When it comes to the Colts, the entire summer will be engulfed with the quarterback battle between Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones. While that certainly warrants the bulk of the attention, Latu entering his second season is another storyline worthy of your attention. Latu was the first defensive player taken in the 2024 NFL Draft and put together a solid rookie season with four sacks and three forced fumbles. That said, there is plenty of room to grow for the former UCLA Bruin, and he could be primed for a breakout sophomore campaign. ', ""Travis Hunter and Brian Thomas Jr. are the main pillars of Jacksonville's offense. However, I think Strange is on the verge of a breakout season. This offseason, Jacksonville released Evan Engram, who averaged 102 targets per season with the franchise. Now, Strange is set to adopt the bulk of those looks from Trevor Lawrence and will play in an offense led by first-year coach Liam Coen. Last year, Coen was the OC for the Buccaneers and helped Cade Otton emerge as one of the better tight ends in the league. Could Strange be the latest to emerge under Coen? "", ""The fourth-round rookie has been impressing throughout the early portions of OTAs. If he can keep that up, he could crash the party inside Tennessee's wide receiver room. Currently, Calvin Ridley, Tyler Lockett, and Van Jefferson make up the top of the receiver masthead, but Lockett and Jefferson could easily be unseated, especially if someone like Ayomanor bursts onto the scene. "", ""When the Chiefs drafted Suamataia in the second round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of BYU, it was hoped that he'd be able to come in and blossom into Patrick Mahomes' left tackle. That never came to fruition, and Kansas City has since drafted Josh Simmons to fill the blindside tackle role. All isn't lost for Suamataia, however, as he is now being looked at as the in-house replacement at left guard after the team traded away Joe Thuney. If Suamataia can make this transition, it'll only further help the Chiefs' offensive line problems that were utterly apparent in their Super Bowl loss to Philadelphia. "", ""Los Angeles' secondary was silently overhauled this offseason. The club let Kristian Fulton leave in free agency and hasn't been in a rush to re-sign Asante Samuel Jr., who remains on the free agent market. While the Chargers did sign Donte Jackson to a two-year, $13 million contract, their willingness to let those players go may also indicate they are comfortable with the likes of Still ascending into a bigger role in the secondary. Still was a fifth-round pick out of Maryland in 2024 and was solid during his rookie season. He started in 12 of his 14 games played, totaled 62 tackles, 10 pass breakups and four interceptions. "", ""Denver spent the offseason adding the likes of tight end Evan Engram and running back RJ Harvey to its offense, but Mims could be the straw that stirs the drink for Sean Payton. Midway through last season, it felt like the Broncos unlocked Mims. From Week 10 to Week 18, Mims caught 32 of his 37 targets for 447 yards and six touchdowns. If you were to project that out over a full season, Mims would be looking at a season where he finished with 68 catches, 950 yards, and an eye-popping 13 touchdowns. And that's even mentioning Payton giving him a couple of touches as a runner as well. "", ""Koonce missed the entire 2024 season due to a torn ACL, but is back on the field for offseason workouts. The last time we saw the 2021 third-round pick, he piled up eight sacks in 17 games (11 starts) during the 2023 season. If Koonce can return to form, he'll be an extremely valuable addition for the Raiders pass rush. Playing opposite of Maxx Crosby should also open up more lanes to the quarterback for Koonce as well.

"Seven NFL enigmas in 2025: Kyler Murray, Kyle Pitts, Bryce Huff among a confounding group of players",https://www.nfl.com/news/seven-nfl-enigmas-in-2025-kyler-murray-kyle-pitts-bryce-huff-among-a-confounding-group-of-players,"['NFL.com Analyst', ""Former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks knows the ins and outs of this league, providing keen insight in his notebook. In today's installment, he explores seven of the game's most confounding players ..."", 'In the NFL, there are established superstars and role players, rising youngsters and declining veterans. But there are also guys who exist in a sort of purgatory state between good and bad, young and old. These are the enigmas -- players who tease us with flashes of brilliance but lack the consistency to stamp themselves as standouts. Heading into the 2025 season, here are seven individuals who fit the bill.', ""The former No. 1 overall pick is a gifted playmaker with a pair of Pro Bowls and the 2019 Offensive Rookie of the Year award on his résumé. At times, Murray has played at a high level and captivated the football world as an electric dual-threat quarterback. However, the seventh-year pro sports a 36-45-1 career record and lacks a playoff win as the Cardinals' QB1, having thrown two picks and posted a 40.9 passer rating in his lone postseason appearance. Though his early accomplishments prompted Arizona to sign him to a blockbuster extension (five years, $230.5 million) back in the 2022 offseason, the Cardinals need him to provide more consistent excellence to justify the return on their investment in a league that measures quarterback success by wins and rings."", ""The big-play specialist has terrorized opponents during stretches as a vertical playmaker with exceptional size, length and leaping ability. Over his first three NFL campaigns, Pickens averaged a whopping 16.3 yards per catch and scored 13 touchdowns despite playing on a team lacking competent quarterback play. And yet, Pittsburgh still traded for DK Metcalf this offseason before dealing Pickens to Dallas. Clearly, the Steelers chafed at the 24-year-old's immaturity and inconsistency, ultimately preventing the team from committing to Pickens as the No. 1 option. But with the Cowboys, Pickens could be the perfect WR1/WR2 hybrid to share the marquee with CeeDee Lamb. Considering the number of 1-on-1 chances Pickens will receive in an offense that is committed to pushing the ball down the field with Dak Prescott at the helm, Dallas' newest pass catcher could take a major step forward in a contract season."", 'As the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Thibodeaux was expected to take the league by storm as an explosive pass-rushing threat off the edge. Though the fourth-year pro has amassed 21 sacks, six forced fumbles and 46 quarterback hits in 43 career games, the polarizing defender has not blossomed into the game changer some envisioned when the Giants added him to a front that desperately needed an impact player on the edge. With Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and 2025 No. 3 overall pick Abdul Carter poised to command significant attention from opponents this fall, Thibodeaux will have plenty of chances to show off his pass-rushing prowess against favorable 1-on-1 matchups at the point of attack.', 'The supersized cover corner earned Pro Bowl honors as a rookie in 2022, but he has been unable to sustain that stellar level of play over the past two seasons, sending him into a contract year as something of a question mark. With injuries and inconsistent technique preventing him from dominating on the island, the Seahawks are playing the ""wait and see"" game before determining whether to sign the former fifth-round pick to a long-term deal. If the 6-foot-4, 210-pounder can regain the focus and form that helped shine as a lockdown defender early in his career, Seattle could build around an ultra-athletic corner with the length and explosiveness to shut down elite WR1s on the perimeter.', 'The 6-6, 250-pound tight end has failed to play up to the gold jacket projections that accompanied his arrival in Atlanta as the fourth overall pick in the 2021 draft. Sure, he made the Pro Bowl as a rookie, eclipsing 1,000 yards receiving in Year 1, but the production since has been underwhelming. Despite possessing receiver-like route-running ability and ball skills, Pitts has not created or exploited the mismatches many envisioned when evaluating him coming out of Florida. In a contract year with big-armed quarterback Michael Penix Jr. under center, can Pitts showcase ""take over the game"" ability?', 'The sixth-year pro has teased scouts with his explosive athleticism and pass-rushing prowess. In 2023, Huff looked like an ascending star after notching 10 sacks and leading the NFL with a 21.8% pressure rate (min. 250 pass rushes, per Next Gen Stats) during his final campaign with the Jets. Though he flopped with the Eagles after inking a three-year, $51 million deal as a marquee free agent last offseason, a trade to the 49ers reunites the edge rusher with his former coach (Robert Saleh), which could help him regain his swagger in San Francisco. Given a chance to play opposite a premier pass rusher who commands extra attention in Nick Bosa, Huff could remind the football world of his disruptive ability this season.', 'As a freak athlete with exceptional range, Walker is a tackling machine in the middle of the Packers\' defense. A first-round pick back in 2022, he has started 43 games and piled up 100-plus tackles in each season. While his 341 total tackles rank second among all defenders from the 2022 draft class (behind only Devin Lloyd\'s figure of 355), the Packers declined his fifth-year option. Walker has struggled with mental mistakes and has let his emotions get the best of him at times (SEE: two game ejections and a number of inexcusable penalties). He also hasn\'t produced many turnovers (three forced fumbles, one fumble recover and one pick over three years). Perhaps another season in Jeff Hafley\'s ""see ball, get ball"" defense will fully unlock his talents and motivate Green Bay to re-up him on a lucrative extension.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 NFL Enterprises LLC.

10 second-year players poised for bigger roles in 2025,https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-second-year-players-bigger-roles-2025,"['2YHEE6K Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, November 10, 2024, San Francisco wide receiver Ricky Pearsall #14 makes a run resulting in a touchdown at Raymond James Stadium. (Photo Credit: Marty Jean-Louis/Alamy Live News', 'Estimated Reading Time: 14 minutes', 'Every year, rookies across the NFL come in and make immediate impacts for their respective teams. Last season alone, seven ranked among the top 10 at their respective position in PFF overall grade: cornerbacks Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell, quarterback Jayden Daniels, running back Bucky Irving, wide receiver Malik Nabers, edge defender Jared Verse and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper.', 'While these players have already established themselves in the NFL, it’s important to point out that most rookies do not have the same success. For some, the learning curve from college to the pros is steeper. For others, injuries and/or depth chart hurdles make it difficult to get on the field. ', 'With this in mind, let’s look at 10 second-year players who could step into bigger roles in 2025.', 'The Dolphins selected Paul in the second round (55th overall) in the 2024 NFL Draft, a move that had 2025 and beyond in the thought process as Terron Armstead’s replacement. Armstead recently announced his retirement but was excellent in his final season, finishing the year as a top-five tackle (89.4 PFF overall grade) and playing his most snaps since 2020.', 'Paul appeared in 10 games, three of which he logged two snaps or fewer in, but struggled in his first season, finishing the year with a 44.9 PFF overall grade. In Paul’s defense, he was tasked with coming off the bench to block All-Pro Myles Garrett in Week 17 and played out of position (right tackle) in Week 18 against the Jets to close out the season, two games that accounted for more than 30% of his total snaps for the season.', 'The pressure will be on Paul to solidify the left tackle position in 2025 as the clear starter coming into camp. It’s not realistic to expect the second-year pro to have the same kind of season Armstead is coming off, but he must develop into a reliable tackle for the team to have any chance of making the playoffs.', 'A second-round pick out of BYU, Suamataia was thrust into action to open the 2024 season as Patrick Mahomes’ blindside protector. Things didn’t go well for the rookie early on, as he finished his second game as a pro with a 26.4 PFF pass-blocking grade against the Bengals. He allowed two sacks in the contest and was benched the following week.', 'Suamataia played sparingly the rest of the year but did get an opportunity at left guard later in the season against Denver, impressing in run blocking (75.2). He will enter camp this year as the favorite to start at left guard, but it will be a battle to watch with Mike Caliendo leading up to the season.', ""Philadelphia's defensive line will look a lot different this year after the team parted ways with Josh Sweat (free agent), Milton Williams (free agent), Brandon Graham (retirement) and Bryce Huff (trade). The Eagles are still stout along the trenches, thanks to their ability to draft and develop players better than any other franchise."", 'Hunt, a former no-star recruit and safety at Cornell, made the switch to edge rusher at Houston Christian in 2022 and dominated the competition. He was a difference-maker for the Eagles’ Super Bowl-winning roster last year, finishing with a 69.0 PFF overall grade as a rookie across his 343 defensive snaps.', 'Coming into Year 2, the expectation is that Hunt will see significantly more playing time on the league’s best defense as the Eagles look to make it back to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years.', 'Pearsall missed the first six weeks of the season after recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest just before Week 1. He had a productive second half of the season after his return, catching 31 of 44 targets for 400 yards and three touchdowns.', 'First career TD for Ricky Pearsall\n\nLove to see it 🙌\npic.twitter.com/Yxz79AkO4j', 'The 49ers traded wide receiver Deebo Samuel to the Washington Commanders in March, creating a path for Pearsall to step into a bigger role in 2025. Samuel graded out no lower than 70.9 in his six years with the team, so San Francisco will be counting on Pearsall to produce in a big way moving forward.', 'The Lions drafted Mahogany in the sixth round (211nd overall) in last year’s draft, a move considered a steal at the time for the 106th-ranked prospect on the PFF Big Board. A guard only and a powerful run-blocker for a team that aims to establish itself on the ground, he was a natural fit along the Lions’ dominant offensive line.', ""Mahogany served as a backup in the regular season, but when starting right guard Kevin Zeitler went down with a hamstring injury in Week 18, he was inserted into the starting lineup for the Lions' wild-card playoff game against the Washington Commanders. Mahogany dominated in his spot start, earning an elite 92.2 PFF overall grade, the highest for any offensive player that night."", 'Zeitler signed with the Tennessee Titans in free agency, and long-term center Frank Ragnow announced his retirement earlier this week, leaving one of the top offensive lines in the league with some questions along the interior. Mahogany and 2025 rookie Tate Ratledge will be counted on to fill the void for the NFC North favorite Lions.', ""The Dolphins traded up to draft Wright in the fourth round (120th overall) in the 2024 NFL Draft. He didn’t get much playing time as a rookie in a crowded backfield behind De'Von Achane and Raheem Mostert, seeing just 171 snaps over 15 games."", 'Wright was productive in his limited action, ranking among the top 20 qualifying running backs in yards after contact per attempt (3.25) and missed tackles forced per attempt (0.24). He also earned an 87.9 PFF overall grade in Week 5 against New England, his only game with 10-plus rushing attempts all season.', 'Wright’s outlook for 2025 is promising, with Mostert now a member of the Las Vegas Raiders and the Dolphins likely looking to scale back Achane’s workload this year after a 203-carry season. Achane also sees a lot of work as a receiver, as he led all running backs in receptions (78), receiving yards (598) and touchdowns (six) in 2024, and that could scale up in 2025.', 'Wilson had a rookie season to forget in 2024, as he suffered an ankle injury in the Steelers’ first padded practice and missed most of the remainder of camp and the preseason. His NFL debut in Week 6 lasted just five snaps before a hamstring injury ended his campaign for good.', 'In his final season at Michigan in 2023, Wilson accounted for 48 receptions, 789 yards and 12 touchdowns. He displayed strong hands (just one drop) and big-play ability, catching 12 passes 20-plus yards downfield.', 'Moving forward, Wilson has an opportunity to step up into a bigger role. With George Pickens being traded to Dallas, Pittsburgh has very little depth at wide receiver behind recently acquired D.K. Metcalf, and the team will need his production to contend in a tough AFC North division.', 'Like Patrick Paul, Fisher was a second-round pick (59th overall) who struggled in his rookie season (44.7) but enters Year 2 as a clear starting offensive tackle option. Offensive line is a position of concern for the Texans following their trade of Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil to Washington, so it’s important that Fisher develops into a solid starter.', 'Fisher was a consistent player in college at Notre Dame, grading out at 72.9 in 2022 and 71.8 in 2023 and playing 1,584 snaps over that span. ', 'Allen impressed in his rookie campaign with the Jets, earning an 82.0 PFF rushing grade across 92 rushing attempts, and he did so as the youngest active player (20 years old) in the NFL. Breece Hall is expected to remain the lead back in New York, but the arrow is pointing up on Allen’s outlook this season.', 'Braelon Allen finds the endzone for the lead! pic.twitter.com/V5tUmJgvHk', 'Ball security is always a big factor when it comes to playing time for running backs. Last season, Allen didn’t fumble once, whereas Hall was charged with six. Although Hall’s production is above average, it has steadily declined over the past two seasons when it comes to yards per carry and yards after contact per attempt after an electric start to his career.', 'With Hall set to become a free agent in 2026, it would not be a surprise to see the Jets give Allen a bigger role in his second season. First-year offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand worked under Ben Johnson in Detroit and figures to bring his run-first mentality to the Jets, something that bodes well for Allen in his second season.', 'Robinson was the 27th overall pick in last year’s draft but was limited to just six games (184 snaps) due to a nagging calf injury and a bereavement period away from the team. He struggled to make much of an impact when on the field, generating just two pressures on 120 pass-rushing snaps.', 'Admittedly, the path for Robinson to earn playing time may be less clear than others on this list. The Cardinals signed future Hall-of-Famer Calais Campbell (the highest-graded interior run defender in 2024) and Dalvin Tomlinson (67.4 PFF overall grade) and spent their 2025 first-round pick on Ole Miss defensive tackle Walter Nolen. They also bolstered their edge unit by signing free agent Josh Sweat after his Super Bowl run with the Philadelphia Eagles.', ""It’s hard to believe Robinson won’t have every opportunity to earn snaps with his play during camp, just one year removed from being a first-round pick. With that said, it’s fair to assume that his leash may be shorter, given the team's newfound depth along the defensive line."", 'SIGN UP', 'Our exclusive database, featuring the most in-depth collection of NFL player performance data.', 'Available with', 'Unlock the 2024 Fantasy Draft Kit, with Live Draft Assistant, Fantasy Mock Draft Sim, Rankings & PFF Grades']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTZWbk5XUlVjeVozVm1jMDVGVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZbGhvanN1UVE=-w280-h168-p-df

Eight young NFL players whose development could propel their teams in 2025,https://www.nfl.com/news/young-nfl-players-whose-development-could-change-their-teams-trajectories-in-2025-season,"['NFL.com Columnist', ""The trade that sent wide receiver George Pickens from Pittsburgh to Dallas created ample speculation about the Cowboys' impending future. Dallas went from being a team that had little chance of making any noise to one that had legitimate playoff aspirations again. The arrival of Pickens meant that much to the perception around them. As long as the mercurial receiver can avoid the immaturity that plagued him with the Steelers, he has a chance to significantly shape the way this season plays out."", ""Pickens, by the way, isn't the only young veteran who could seriously impact the league by taking a huge leap in the development process. Every year, there's a discussion about potential breakout stars in various places, but only so many can do things that truly alter a team's trajectory. This edition of The First Read plans to focus on those players who are positioned to do just that. These are the ones we all might be talking about at season's end if they blossom like their respective teams hope ..."", ""There was so much expected of Williams in his rookie season that we sometimes forget he wasn’t a complete disaster. He did some impressive things for a player who had never played pro football, throwing for 3,541 yards with 20 touchdowns and six interceptions and rushing for another 489 yards. Legends like Peyton Manning and John Elway would’ve loved to have produced those kinds of numbers as rookies. The problem for Williams, the top pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, was that he was supposed to be a generational talent, then didn’t create much magic for a Bears team that finished 5-12 and imploded in epic fashion. The Bears quarterback heads into Year 2 with plenty of reasons to believe better days are coming. His new coach, Ben Johnson, is one of the most innovative minds in football. Bears general manager Ryan Poles retooled the interior of an offensive line that was largely responsible for a league-high 68 sacks and added two more pass-catchers in the draft (tight end Colston Loveland and wide receiver Luther Burden III) to an already deep group of skill players. The Bears had to do all this not only to help their second-year quarterback prosper. They’re also playing in the NFC North, which has turned into the toughest division in football. There isn’t a team in that division that shouldn’t be thinking about winning it and making a deep playoff run. If Williams does his part, it wouldn't be crazy for the Bears to dream the same thoughts."", 'There was a lot of buzz around McCarthy heading into last year, until a preseason knee injury opened the door for Sam Darnold to become the Vikings’ starting quarterback. McCarthy impressed the coaches and front office with his intangibles -- his charisma, his leadership and his ability to learn quickly -- and the expectation is that essentially taking a redshirt year will end up being beneficial to his development. McCarthy also is walking into the same situation that helped Darnold prosper in 2024. The supporting cast on offense remains stellar, particularly with All-Pro wide receiver Justin Jefferson at his disposal. The defense should be strong once more, especially with lineman Jonathan Allen joining a unit that tied for fourth in the NFL with 49 sacks in 2024. The key is whether McCarthy has the maturity to go out and not do too much. He was only 21 years old when he entered the league as the 10th overall selection, so that year on the sidelines wasn’t a bad deal for him. He’s also going to benefit from a coaching staff that is one of the best in the league at working with quarterbacks. Head coach Kevin O’Connell, offensive coordinator Wes Phillips and quarterbacks coach Josh McCown have proven their ability to maximize the strengths of the signal-callers that come under their tutelage. Those talents will be essential in helping McCarthy blossom. The Vikings won 14 games last year while he watched from the sideline. At the very least, he should be able to lead Minnesota back to the postseason. If he’s as good as advertised, this team could go on a deep playoff run.', ""Yes, the Chiefs must fix their offensive line problems, with left tackle being a major priority. They also need to see Worthy, their first-round pick in the 2024 draft, continue the development he displayed throughout last year and into the postseason. We still don't know whether or not Rashee Rice will serve a suspension because of his involvement in a car crash in Dallas last spring. Rice also is returning from a major knee surgery, and the Chiefs' third receiver, Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, has a history of dealing with injuries (he missed 14 games last year with a shoulder/collarbone injury). Worthy was the player who emerged when those setbacks occurred, and there likely will be stretches when he’s the top receiving option this fall (especially with star tight end Travis Kelce turning 36 in October). Worthy proved that he was more than a speedster who could stretch defenses, as head coach Andy Reid put more responsibilities on him with each passing week. He finished the season with 59 receptions, 638 yards and six touchdowns, but his postseason contributions were far more notable. He led the team with six receptions for 85 yards and a touchdown in an AFC championship win over Buffalo. He also was one of the few positives in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LIX, as he finished with eight catches for 157 yards and two scores, most of which came in garbage time. Those efforts indicated how much Worthy grew over the season, and how high his ceiling could be moving forward. Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes have had little success at returning that offense to its more explosive ways over the last two years. The emergence of Worthy would help that cause immensely."", 'There’s been a lot of speculation about the factors that could keep the Eagles from repeating as Super Bowl champions, and most of it tends to revolve around the losses along their defensive front. Along with the departure of defensive end Milton Williams in free agency, the Eagles also watched edge rushers Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham (retired) leave the franchise. That means new faces must emerge to impact the quarterback, and Smith will be one of the most important pieces on the outside. He’s always had the talent, as his 4.39-second time in the 40-yard dash at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine helped turn him into a first-round pick that year.', '', ""Last season, Smith showcased his ability to transform potential into production. He went from playing a limited role as a rookie to amassing 6.5 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures in his second year. Smith also had four sacks in three playoff games leading into Super Bowl LIX before adding a couple of quarterback hits in that win over Kansas City. Smith has spent the last two seasons playing behind more accomplished pass rushers. This is the season when he must take that next step and prove he’s more than just a nice rotational weapon. Philadelphia’s schedule is filled with prolific offenses and athletic quarterbacks, both outside the NFC East (like Mahomes, Buffalo’s Josh Allen and Green Bay’s Jordan Love) and within it (Washington’s Jayden Daniels and Dallas’ Dak Prescott). The Eagles' ability to defend those opponents won’t just come down to their strong secondary. They’ll need more disruptive players up front, and that’s where Smith needs to deliver."", 'There were high expectations for Kincaid after he produced 73 receptions as a rookie in 2023. But last year wasn’t nearly as much fun for him. His contributions decreased (he only had 44 catches in 13 games), and he dropped a desperation pass from Josh Allen in what became the final play of the Bills’ season in an AFC Championship Game loss to Kansas City. There were plenty of questions about Kincaid’s slippage, but it seems that health played a role in that, as the tight end dealt with a collarbone injury and injuries to both knees. So if he returns to form in 2025, there’s every reason to expect Kincaid to look more like the ascending talent he was in his first season. The Bills will still be relying on an assortment of pass-catchers to support Allen and fuel this offense. Plenty of targets will go to wide receivers like Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Josh Palmer, but the usage rate of Kincaid also should be a critical aspect of what Buffalo hopes to accomplish on that side of the football. The Bills envisioned him as a matchup nightmare when they made him a first-round pick two years ago. If he becomes that, then this offense certainly goes to another level, with Allen’s improvisational skills, a couple of running backs who can create problems in the pass game (James Cook, Ty Johnson) and one of the best offensive lines in football. The Bills have been trying to get over the hump -- by that, we mean the Kansas City Chiefs -- in the AFC for the last five years. Kincaid becoming a dominant weapon is something this team definitely needs to see happen.', ""The Packers have made it known they want to do a better job pressuring opposing passers. They’ve also made it clear they think they have the necessary people in the building, which means there’s confidence in Van Ness showing marked improvement in his third season. Lofty expectations have hovered over him since Green Bay selected him 13th overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, but the results have been mixed. So far, he’s produced eight sacks and 17 quarterback hits in his career (including playoffs), which is not nearly enough for a player selected that high. Part of the problem might be circumstances. Van Ness has played for two different coordinators in two seasons, as he lined up as an outside linebacker in Joe Barry's 3-4 defense as a rookie before switching back to the role of down lineman in the 4-3 system current coordinator Jeff Hafley installed last offseason. It’s possible that Van Ness hasn’t been as productive because he’s had to learn a lot of things on the fly. Of course, the Packers don’t want to think about the other possibility, which is that he just might not be good at bringing quarterbacks down. The Packers enjoyed obvious improvement in Year 1 with Hafley, especially when it came to creating turnovers. However, harassing opposing signal-callers is vital to surviving in the NFC North. The Detroit Lions had the best offense in football last year. Their former offensive coordinator, Ben Johnson, is now the head coach of a Chicago Bears team that has loaded up on offense to help Caleb Williams thrive. The Vikings are relying on J.J. McCarthy to be an improvement over Sam Darnold. Even with all those challenges, the Packers can win that division. However, it’s not going to happen unless they can make life difficult for all those quarterbacks, and Van Ness needs to play a huge role in that."", 'Penix was a hot topic at this time last year because nobody really understood how the quarterback situation in Atlanta would play out. After all, the Falcons used the eighth overall pick in the draft on him nearly two months after giving Kirk Cousins $100 million in guaranteed money in free agency. The belief was that Cousins would hold the job for at least a couple of years, until Penix was ready to play. Now Cousins is trying to figure out where his career is heading after being benched for the last three games, and Penix is the player tasked with helping the Falcons break a seven-year playoff drought. Penix didn’t do anything breathtaking in his three starts -- he completed 58 percent of his passes for 737 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions as Atlanta went 1-2 -- but he also didn’t do anything to make people think he couldn’t mature into a reliable leader.', '', 'There is still plenty to like about the situation that Atlanta is dropping him into this fall. The Falcons have a strong backfield (Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier), talented receivers (Drake London produced 100 receptions in 2024, while Darnell Mooney amassed 992 receiving yards) and a solid offensive line. These are the types of assets franchises need to put around young quarterbacks, and the Falcons invested heavily in their defense by drafting two edge rushers in the first round in April. Penix is basically in a situation similar to Williams and McCarthy. He doesn’t have to morph into Patrick Mahomes. He just needs to avoid the devastating turnovers that plagued Cousins in the second half of last season and lead this team into the postseason.', 'Harrison produced a solid rookie season with the Cardinals, finishing with 62 receptions for 885 yards and eight touchdowns. Unfortunately for him, he suffered from the same issues that haunted Caleb Williams: The expectations were much higher for him when he entered the league. Some people talked about Harrison as if the Cardinals had just found their next Larry Fitzgerald when he became the fourth overall pick in last year’s draft, a foundational receiver who would dominate for years to come. Harrison still has ample time to deliver on his potential, and a breakout season this fall would make the Cardinals turn the corner on becoming playoff contenders. This team was sitting at 6-4 in early November, with a four-game win streak inspiring optimism about the Cardinals playing meaningful football in January. They ultimately lost five of their last seven games, and Harrison failed to reach 65 receiving yards in six of those contests. That can’t happen in his second season. Harrison displayed flashes of what he could become at multiple times last year (including a 130-yard effort in a 41-10 win over the Rams and a 111-yard day in a comeback victory at Miami). He just needs to do more of that, which isn’t a ridiculous goal, now that he’s had a full offseason to work with quarterback Kyler Murray. It’s rare for gifted wide receivers from Ohio State to fail, as we’ve seen talents like Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Chis Olave produce 1,000-yard seasons within their first two years in the league. Harrison was considered better than all those guys when he arrived. The Cardinals need him to prove as much this fall.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 NFL Enterprises LLC.

"Make-or-break candidates: James Cook, Justin Fields among players at crossroads in 2025 NFL season",https://www.nfl.com/news/make-or-break-candidates-james-cook-justin-fields-among-players-at-crossroads-in-2025-nfl-season,"['Around The NFL Writer', ""With rosters continuing to take shape as we move closer to the start of training camp, it's clear that the 2025 NFL season could be a career-defining campaign for certain players."", ""Some are clinging to past glory, while others are out to prove they're worth big-time money in 2026 and beyond."", ""Below, I've identified 17 of the most prominent players who must deliver in 2025, presented in alphabetical order."", 'With Andrews entering the final year of his contract after surviving an offseason of uncertainty, now is the time for the 29-year-old to give the team overwhelming evidence that it should retain him beyond 2025. From a roster-building perspective, it might make more sense for Baltimore to invest in younger TE Isaiah Likely, whom head coach John Harbaugh is expecting big things from in 2025. But Andrews has held an important place in this era of Ravens football. A monster season -- capped, perhaps, by some clutch postseason plays a year after his meltdown contributed to the team’s playoff exit -- would help his cause. A strong campaign will fetch quality offers elsewhere, too, but if Andrews wants to spend his entire career in Baltimore, he could make that a reality by crushing it in 2025.', ""The 2022 first-round pick spent on Burks -- once envisioned as the replacement for A.J. Brown -- has not come anywhere close to paying off. He's made 53 catches for 699 yards and only one touchdown in three seasons. Tennessee declined his fifth-year option last month and set up a prove-it season. If first overall pick Cam Ward can breathe life into the Titans’ passing game, perhaps Burks will prove his worth. But given what we've seen in his first three seasons, it will be surprising if Burks suddenly blossoms, even with a more talented quarterback now under center."", 'The Chiefs moved on from Joe Thuney this offseason, shipping out the most trustworthy member of the left side of their line. Caliendo got a chance to start at left guard late last season after Thuney moved to left tackle, but now he has a chance to win the job at left guard outright -- although he’s battling against 2024 second-round pick Kingsley Suamataia for the gig. In fact, the whole left side of the line is auditioning, with free-agent addition Jaylon Moore looking to fill the void at left tackle and 2025 first-round pick Josh Simmons set to compete when he’s healthy enough to do so as he returns from a torn patellar tendon. However, Caliendo is facing the pressure of being in a contract year. Oh, and he also must protect Patrick Mahomes, the superstar face of a perennial Super Bowl contender.', ""Cook enters the new season with uncertainty long-term. He’s made clear his desire for a new contract, but the Bills don’t appear to have budged, even after his second straight 1,000-yard season, in which he averaged nearly five yards per carry and rushed for a league-high 16 touchdowns. So, Cook is staying away from voluntary OTAs. To fully convince Buffalo to invest in him with a new deal, Cook will almost certainly need to outperform his production over the last two years, which means posting something like 1,200-plus rushing yards and double-digit rushing touchdowns, along with 300-plus receiving yards and a handful of receiving scores. That's a high bar for a back who has already done enough to deserve consideration for an extension. If Buffalo doesn't pay Cook, somebody else will, given that he maintains the performance he's demonstrated over the last two seasons."", ""Darnold dominated headlines last season by helping Minnesota win 14 games and earned a lucrative deal from Seattle, a franchise that willingly jettisoned Geno Smith to Las Vegas in favor of a philosophical change built around the mind of new OC Klint Kubiak and Darnold's strengths. It's a calculated risk that will attract plenty of attention this fall. The calculated part, though, shows in Darnold's contract. If the veteran can't produce at an acceptable level in his first season in Seattle, the Seahawks can cut him (after June 1) and save $27.5 million of his $33.9 million cap number in 2026 -- giving themselves an exit plan if they need one."", ""Etienne registered back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in 2022 and 2023, but his workload diminished significantly in 2024. His carries dropped from an average of 243.5 per year over those first two campaigns to 150 last season, when he missed two games due to injury. Backup Tank Bigsby emerged as the more viable option in what was generally a dreadful Jaguars offense last year. In fact, Bigsby finished with a higher rushing total (766 yards) than Etienne (558 yards). Entering the 2025 draft, many believed the Jaguars would select Boise State star Ashton Jeanty with the fifth overall pick and replace Etienne entirely, but when they instead traded up to take Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter at No. 2, Etienne received a new lease on his Jaguars life. That hasn't come without skepticism, of course; on Monday, new head coach Liam Coen quelled trade rumors involving Etienne. But what we should truly take from all of this is one simple fact: Etienne, entering a contract year, has one more chance to prove he should be in Jacksonville's long-term plans, and that opportunity arrives in 2025."", ""Fields signed a two-year, $40 million deal to become the Jets' chosen new starter in 2025, but if we look at what it might cost them to get out of said deal after the coming season, it's clear this is a one-year tryout. A post-June 1 trade next offseason would clear all but $3 million of his $23 million cap number in 2026, per Over The Cap. Fields must prove he's worth keeping in 2025 because, generally speaking, it feels as if the NFL's intrigue regarding the fifth-year pro is starting to run out. That curiosity convinced the Steelers to add him via trade last offseason, but their stubborn commitment to Russell Wilson in the final weeks of the season -- when they lost five straight, including to rival Baltimore in the Wild Card Round -- told us how Pittsburgh felt about Fields. If the former first-round pick is going to prove his most ardent supporters correct, he needs to start doing so now. "", 'Jones was effective at right tackle in his rookie year, replacing the injured Jack Conklin and posting some impressive numbers as a pass protector. The same was not true in 2024 before an injury ended his campaign in Week 11. His Pro Football Focus grade dropped precipitously and led to questions about whether his rookie season was an aberration. Cleveland is going to figure it out once and for all in 2025, because Jones is penciled in as the replacement for the still unsigned Jedrick Wills at left tackle. Time to deliver.', ""This is about earning the final year of his contract. Lattimore moved to Washington as a coveted trade acquisition but struggled to find the same form with the Commanders, posting some truly dreadful Pro Football Focus grades in the postseason. There's reason to believe a full year with Dan Quinn will fix things, and Lattimore is under pressure to do so this fall because the Commanders can cut ties with zero financial penalty in 2026. However, Lattimore has not joined the team for the offseason program, per defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. At 29 years old, Lattimore could still earn decent money on a new deal, but the main goal is to prove himself as a trusted corner for a team that aims to build on its surprise run to the NFC Championship Game last season. If he does that, he'll be much easier to keep or at least consider for a contract restructure that's friendlier to the team's salary cap."", ""Football can be a cruel game sometimes. Take the recent turn in Milano's career, for example. He finally received All-Pro recognition in 2022, only to follow it up with two injury-plagued seasons that limited him to a combined total of nine games in that stretch. He's in the final year of his contract and turns 31 years old in July. His inclusion on this list isn't so much about preserving or capitalizing on significant earning power, but it is tied to returning strong with the only NFL team he's ever known -- a team that has Super Bowl ambitions."", ""A player as talented as Olave shouldn't be in this position, but he's suffered a series of concussions going back to his days at Ohio State (including two such injuries last season) and has reached a point in his career where he needs to prove he can stay healthy. New Orleans picked up his fifth-year option this offseason, a move that showed the team’s confidence in the former Buckeyes star. But after two 1,000-yard seasons, Olave played in just eight games in an injury-plagued 2024, finishing with 32 catches for 400 yards and one score. New Orleans' instability at quarterback hasn’t helped him, but Olave can do himself a lot of good by staying on the field in 2025. While his fifth-year option essentially ensures he'll be with the Saints through 2026, there's no guarantee it's a precursor for an extended career in the Big Easy."", ""Phillips is another case of bad injury luck. After two strong seasons to begin his NFL career (with a combined 15.5 sacks), Phillips suffered an Achilles injury in the Black Friday game in 2023, then suffered a season-ending knee injury early in the 2024 campaign, marking two straight years in which he was robbed of the chance to play a full slate. As a player who overcame plenty of health challenges in college -- he medically retired from football in 2018 before returning in 2020 -- this is nothing new to Phillips, but his mettle will truly be tested in 2025. He’s in the final year of his rookie deal with a Dolphins team that is feeling the pressure to succeed. If he can stay healthy, perhaps he can get back on track. He'll have to do so while knowing it is a make-or-break year for him."", ""Fantasy owners know Pitts' paradox all too well. The uber-athletic tight end began his career with great expectations, posting a 1,000-yard rookie season. However, he’s tallied just 128 catches for 1,625 yards and nine touchdowns combined in the three seasons since. He's in the final year of his rookie deal, with a very uncertain future ahead of him. Pitts has watched other first-round talents at his position thrive for other clubs, and while he's been dealt a somewhat-unfair hand with Atlanta's revolving door at quarterback, the time is now to prove he's worth keeping around beyond 2025. Some extra time spent with QB Michael Penix Jr. might help those efforts, especially after he saw just 74 targets in his first season in offensive coordinator Zac Robinson's scheme, but Pitts is currently dealing with an injury that has kept him off the field during OTAs."", ""First, let me note that while he's accomplished plenty in his career, Patriots WR Stefon Diggs' 2025 season is also a make-or-break campaign because New England can essentially move on from him after a year with little financial penalty. Now that we've handled that, let's turn our attention to one of the most underwhelming receivers from the 2024 draft class. While Brian Thomas Jr. and Malik Nabers were torching defenses elsewhere, Polk resided in the shadows as a rookie, catching just 12 passes for 87 yards and two touchdowns in an offense that was desperate for a pass catcher to separate from the pack. Polk needs to take a big step forward in 2025 to prevent the Patriots from finding a replacement for him, because while they're not on a title-chasing timeline right now, they need reliable producers for QB Drake Maye."", ""A quick rehash of the Richardson career arc leaves us with two main themes: He's an incredibly gifted athlete with sky-high potential, and he’s also lacked the consistency to hold down the Colts’ starting job. Indianapolis' patience ran thin with Richardson in 2024, so the team added competition for him this offseason with the signing of Daniel Jones. As the fourth overall pick of the 2023 draft, Richardson was an expensive investment. Such investments don't guarantee long leashes, though, which Richardson has already learned. We'll see if the pressure has inspired improvement, or if Richardson will be usurped by another former first-rounder in Jones."", '', ""EDITOR'S UPDATE: Richardson is dealing with a shoulder injury and will not participate in the team's minicamp next week, head coach Shane Steichen told reporters on Thursday. Steichen added that the QB sustained the injury in his throwing shoulder last week during OTAs."", ""Swift has two years remaining on his existing deal and has been reunited this offseason with his former offensive coordinator in Detroit, new Bears coach Ben Johnson. That might not be the most encouraging news, though: Swift ran for just 542 yards and five touchdowns in his final season in Detroit before leaving for Philadelphia, clearing the way for the Lions to rebuild their backfield with David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs. Swift will need to produce a better season under Johnson's direction in 2025 than he did back then, especially because the Bears can save all but $1.3 million of his $8.8 million cap number in 2026 by cutting him. With plenty of eyeballs on Chicago in Johnson's first season at the helm, now is the time for Swift to prove he deserves to stick around."", ""Williams fizzled out in Denver and ended up accepting a one-year, $3 million deal to headline Dallas' underwhelming backfield. The sizzle he once brought to the Broncos faded before 2024, but he has a rare opportunity to regain it for a Cowboys team that should boast some offensive firepower, with CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens at receiver. If Williams is going to command a starting job anywhere in the NFL from here on out, it must begin in Dallas."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTZWbk5XUlVjeVozVm1jMDVGVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdZbGhvanN1UVE=-w280-h168-p-df
Bryce Young ranked best potential breakout player for 2025 NFL season,https://www.si.com/nfl/panthers/bryce-young-carolina-panthers-nfl-best-breakout-candidate-2025,"[""No quarterback finished the second half of the 2024 NFL season on a better trajectory than Carolina Panthers starter Bryce Young. It didn't happen all at once, but Young made strides each week after returning to the lineup midseason following a six-week benching. That apparently was exactly what Young needed, because he was a totally different athlete and competitor by the end of the year than the one we saw at the beginning."", 'Where Young was timid and uncertain even in clean pockets in Weeks 1-2, Young was confident, even cocky at times by Week 18. Best of all, Young flashed a high-level deep ball - throwing frequently, accurately and aggressively on 20+ yard passes.

In fact, one analyst at Last Word on Sports says he's the best potential breakout player in the NFL this year."", '""Young finished the final ten games of the season, throwing for 2,104 yards, 15 touchdowns, and six interceptions, showing glimpses of why he was chosen first overall.  Young will look to build on that in 2025, and the Panthers are doing what they can to add support after having drafted standout wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan eight overall.""', 'In addition to glowing up the wide receiver room with McMillan and Jimmy Horn Jr., the Panthers also built on the continuity their offensive line had going and added pass-catching weapons at tight end (Mitchell Evans) and running back (Trevor Etienne) in the draft.', ""If head coach Dave Canales can get Young going at a similar level compared to the end of last season, it shouldn't take long for Young to take the next step with a little more experience - which would put him in solid Pro Bowl candidate territory."", ""Then again, every season offers unique challenges and nothing is guaranteed in this league. There's always a chance that Young could regress back into the version of himself we saw his rookie year, or worse. While remote, that potential regression would represent a nightmare scenario for this franchise because without another significant step forward from Bryce Young, all their good offseason work is likely to go to waste."", ""One way Young can help prevent that scenario is to develop a more well-rounded attack. Escaping pressure and thowing deep are great attributes to build on, but those are somewhat unsustainable and in any case not enough to make a living at this level in the long run.
