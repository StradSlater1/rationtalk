Kennedy Jr. said Monday afternoon.', 'Kennedy announced the change in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal, claiming that the “committee has been plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.”', 'Such a claim is ""deeply insulting to the many scientists who contribute countless hours to the process,"" said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious disease expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""We are, in fact, a model for the rest of the world.""', '""This is manufactured chaos,"" O\'Leary said.', 'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known more commonly as ACIP, consists of medical and public health experts — including pediatricians, epidemiologists and geriatricians — who make recommendations to the CDC about who should get certain vaccines, including the schedule for childhood vaccinations. Several times a year the committee holds public meetings where data is presented and reviewed.', ""The committee reports the data to the CDC director, who then reviews the recommendations and can choose whether to adopt them. The CDC director isn't required to do so but usually goes along with the ACIP recommendations."", 'Members of ACIP, who undergo an extensive vetting process before they are appointed, are required to disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from voting on vaccines for which conflicts exist. The CDC released a database in March of some members’ previous work on clinical trials or vaccine research funded by drug companies, but much of the information was already public. Many public health experts argue that past associations with the pharmaceutical industry are relevant and valuable expertise for ACIP members, as long as conflicts are disclosed.', ""“To claim that you are doing this to restore faith in CDC is a special form of gaslighting,” said a CDC employee, referring to Kennedy's comments. The employee did not want to speak on the record for fear of retribution."", 'Dismantling the committee is among Kennedy’s most aggressive actions so far to reshape U.S. vaccine policy. Kennedy, who rose to prominence as a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement, has made a variety of specious and debunked claims about vaccine harms. Since he aligned himself with President Donald Trump and became head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has overseen a series of steps that have undercut vaccine access, including the pullback of funds to distribute vaccines to children of lower-income families.', 'In an interview, Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director, said: “Secretary Kennedy’s unprecedented action spreads confusion and casts doubt on transparent public health processes that protect Americans. I’m deeply concerned for families trying to navigate how to keep their loved ones safe.”', 'Kennedy’s decision to fire ACIP members “should erase any remaining doubt that he intends to impose his personal anti-vaccine agenda on the American people,” Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the CDC and current president of the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said in a statement. He added that Monday’s action will “make it far more difficult for pediatricians and other providers to care for their patients,” since they rely on ACIP’s guidance to make their own vaccine recommendations.', 'In his editorial, Kennedy called for a “clean sweep” of ACIP but did not say whom he planned to appoint to the vacant positions or provide a timeline for filling the roles. HHS said in a news release that ACIP will convene its next meeting from June 25 to June 27.', '“What I think Kennedy is doing here is attempting to replace career civil servants with scientific expertise with those who may be more amenable to his and the Trump administration’s agenda,” said Matt Motta, an assistant professor of health law and policy at Boston University’s School of Public Health.', 'Motta said firing ACIP members is “an unequivocally clear attempt to break the promise” that Kennedy made during his confirmation hearings to not limit vaccine access. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in February that Kennedy had promised to maintain ACIP “without changes.” Cassidy said Monday on X that he will continue to talk with Kennedy to ensure ACIP is not “filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.”', 'The U.S. is experiencing a rise in vaccine-preventable outbreaks, including measles and whooping cough.

Kennedy wrote Monday that “without removing the current members, the current Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028.”', 'The move further degrades the federal government as a trusted source on vaccines and could force consumers, doctors and insurers to look elsewhere for expert guidance on vaccines, according to one ACIP member.', '“The clear implication is that CDC will no longer be credible in the space of vaccination,” said the ACIP member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer does not allow them to speak to the media. “Insurers and other funding agencies will have to turn to the professional associations for recommendations about vaccines.”', 'Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.', 'Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

Cohen,', 'Senior Contributor.', 'Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services, during a Make America Healthy Again ... More', 'Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is making good on his promise to radically reshape the vaccine policy landscape as he ousts the entire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. In a press release issued by the Department of HHS on June 9th, Kennedy says he’s doing this in order to restore the public’s trust in vaccine science in America. It’s unknown who Kennedy will hire to replace committee members, but it’s possible they may share his skeptical views of vaccines. In turn, this could have the effect of increasing the public’s vaccine hesitancy.', 'ACIP advises the director of the CDC on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. For decades, ACIP’s guidance has been based on an independent, non-politicized review of the peer-reviewed scientific research as well as a debate among experts. ACIP’s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood immunization schedules.', 'Neither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC’s messaging, fire and hire ACIP committee members and revise vaccination scheduling.', 'Moreover, the Secretary of HHS together with heads of agencies under his oversight can pursue changes in guidance that restructure regulatory pathways for vaccine development and revise recommendations to the public on who should get vaccinated.', 'In a major policy shift last month, Food and Drug Administration officials proposed requiring new clinical trial research with respect to the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in healthy people under 65, including pregnant women, before issuing an updated approval for a broader population.', 'And we observed a preview of the new FDA approach when the agency made an unusual decision in May to limit the approval of the nation’s only non-mRNA coronavirus vaccine, Novavax’s nuvaxovid, for use only in adults 65 and older or those 12 to 64 who have at least one health problem that puts them at increased risk from COVID-19. And on May 31st, Moderna won approval for its latest COVID-19 vaccine with a similar set of limits.', 'To be indicated for a broader population, the FDA plans to require that vaccine makers conduct booster trials to demonstrate effectiveness in people under 65 or without certain risks. These trials could take a year to complete, according to a STAT report. As such, it’s not something that can be accomplished prior to the autumn, even if Novavax, Pfizer, or Moderna, wished to pursue this pathway.', 'Changes are also occurring at CDC in terms of its messaging on vaccines. While all the standard childhood and adult vaccines are still on the website, the messaging in some instances incorporates more of an “informed consent” approach than a recommendation. Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed.', 'The Prompt: Get the week’s biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.', '', '', '', 'All of the changes we’re seeing shouldn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy’s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he told the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines “are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” he also maintained that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” In March, he commissioned a large-scale study to investigate debunked theories that link autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. And, amid an outbreak of measles this year that started in Texas and spread to surrounding states and cost the lives of three people, Kennedy appeared at times to downplay its severity.', 'Kennedy has also been outspoken about the existing organizational framework within his department, in which he says that with respect to vaccines there are conflicts of interest. In announcing today’s purge of the entire ACIP committee, Kennedy cited the pharmaceutical industry’s close relationship with government agencies and ACIP that advises them. But it’s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice.', 'Kennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no more strict vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he criticizes are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.', 'From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring. To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination—measles, mumps and rubella—shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “sterilizing,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.', 'The American public is already increasingly vaccine-hesitant around standard childhood immunizations. This is likely to lead to more outbreaks and preventable severe illness and death. Should Kennedy appoint like-minded vaccine skeptics to the ACIP committee, that could undermine the public’s trust in vaccines even further.', 'One Community. Many Voices.

But another panel member, Noel Brewer at the University of North Carolina, said he and other committee members received an email late Monday afternoon that said their services on the committee had been terminated but gave no reason.', '“I’d assumed I’d continue serving on the committee for my full term,” said Brewer, who joined the panel last summer.', 'Brewer is a behavioral scientist whose research examines why people get vaccinated and ways to improve vaccination coverage. Whether people get vaccinated is largely influenced by what their doctors recommend, and doctors have been following ACIP guidance.', '“Up until today, ACIP recommendations were the gold standard for what insurers should pay for, what providers should recommend, and what the public should look to,” he said.', 'But Kennedy already took the unusual step of changing COVID-19 recommendations without first consulting the committee — a move criticized by doctors’ groups and public health advocates.', '“It’s unclear what the future holds,” Brewer said. “Certainly provider organizations have already started to turn away from ACIP.”', 'Kennedy said the committee members had too many conflicts of interest.
