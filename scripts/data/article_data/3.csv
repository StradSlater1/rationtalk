Khalil described.', '""I listened to her pain, trying to comfort her while 70 other men slept around me. When I heard my son\'s first cries, I buried my face in my arms so no one would see me weep.""', 'Khalil described that the first time he saw his son was through a window, and the first time he held him was in an immigration courtroom, to which his wife had to travel ten hours to reach, with their newborn.', '""I speak to her as often as possible, but these conversations are not private, everything is monitored by the government,"" Khalil said, which makes it impossible for them to comfortably speak freely.', '""We leave so much unsaid, and that silence weighs heavily on both of us.""', 'Khalil said that not only has the situation been ""devastating"" for him, but that his wife has dealt with harassment since his arrest. Khalil further described the anguish of seeing Trump administration officials post statements and photos of him on social media that he purports as ""accompanied by inflammatory language, grotesque and false accusations, and open celebration of my deportation.""', 'Khalil expressed concern for his future as well. He said he was hired by the nonprofit equality-focused Oxfam International group only days before his arrest as a Palestine and Middle East/ North Africa policy advisor, and was scheduled to start work in April, but the job offer was formally revoked. He says ""I strongly believe"" his arrest and continued detention is the reason for this.', 'He added that should the charges against him stand, ""the harm to my professional career would be career-ending.""', 'Khalil further worried his arrest would result in a lifetime of ""being flagged, delayed, or denied when traveling, applying for visas, or engaging with consular authorities anywhere in the world,"" and not just him, but his wife and son.', 'His mother had also applied for a visa in March to visit the United States to see their child be born, and although that was approved, the U.S. embassy returned her passport without a stamp, and now her case is under ""administrative processing,"" and remains unapproved. Khalil\'s elderly father, whom he describes as ""severely disabled,"" lives in Germany, and he ponders whether any country allied with the United States will ever grant him entry should the charges stand.', 'Khalil detailed the allegations under which he has been held for deportation, which not only did he deny as testimony at his May immigration court hearing, at which he purports ""The government attorneys did not ask me any questions regarding these issues.""', 'However, Khalil maintained his greatest concern of all is a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio based on a law that an ""alien"" can be deported should his presence in the United States ""have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.""', '""I understand that the Rubio Determination is not only a ground for deportation, but it is also a bar to entry,"" said Khalil.', '""In other words, no matter what happens to the other charge against me, it is the Rubio Determination that will make this country, the country of my wife and child, a country I cannot return to in the future.""']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTZPUzFhZEVaRGEzZENXRWd5VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhbGhZek9zUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

His detention also comes as Columbia has opted to acquiesce to the Trump administration’s demands over issues including campus security. Khalil has been one of the most high-profile examples of the White House targeting legal immigrants over their speech.', 'Khalil is a lawful permanent U.S. resident and faces no criminal charges.', 'For now, Abdalla said, she has no idea when she’ll see her husband again. Although a federal judge ruled Wednesday that his detention was likely unconstitutional, he also determined that Khalil could remain in detention. In a second case, an immigration court is weighing the government’s arguments for Khalil’s deportation.', '“We don’t know if Mahmoud’s going to be deported,” Abdalla told The Cut, adding that she’s preparing a passport for their 1-month-old child just in case. “We don’t want to end up needing it and not having it,” she said.', ""For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Friends, observers, and journalists had been lining up for hours outside the imposing Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse to witness the standoff between the US government and Khalil, a thirty-year-old former graduate student at Columbia University who faced deportation because of his support for Palestinians’ rights. A vastly larger crowd formed across the street, waving Palestinian flags and signs that read “STOP US/ISRAELI GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIANS NOW!” and “HANDS OFF OUR STUDENTS.”', 'The previous weekend agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, part of the Department of Homeland Security, had come for three Columbia students. The agents showed up in plain clothes, some obscuring their faces with makeshift masks. At first glance it was unclear whether they represented the US government at all. Ranjani Srinivasan, a Fulbright recipient from India, had learned that week that her student visa was no longer valid; she didn’t answer her door on March 7 when the agents came knocking. A few days later she fled to Canada. Yunseo Chung, a green card holder from South Korea who has lived in the US since age seven, learned that agents visited her parents’ home in search of her. She went into hiding.', 'On Saturday, March 8, when Khalil and his wife, Noor Abdalla, returned to their Columbia-owned apartment building from an iftar around half past eight, two agents appeared and followed them into the lobby. Another two approached from inside the building, identifying themselves as DHS officers. One of the men told Khalil that his student visa had been revoked. Abdalla, who was eight months pregnant, rushed to their apartment to grab documents while Khalil called his lawyer, Amy Greer.', 'Greer had been in touch with Khalil in the months prior to navigate disciplinary hearings at Columbia over inflammatory speech that was misattributed to him. At the end of a working Saturday, she had just kicked up her feet and queued an episode of Ted Lasso when her phone rang. Khalil’s voice was low, and he spoke quickly. “They’re here to detain me,” she recalled him saying.', 'One of the agents grabbed Khalil’s phone, and Greer demanded to know why they were taking him. Did they have a warrant? The agent mumbled some vague answers, and soon the line went dead. (It later emerged that they did not have a warrant at that time.) Greer burst into tears; she contacted a fellow defense attorney, and together they called Khalil.

Khalil has been detained in Louisiana for nearly three months, in what Azmy calls one of “our immigration gulags.” Khalil’s legal team is now challenging the State Department’s determination that his presence in the United States harms the country’s foreign policy interests.', 'AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask you about one of your clients, the detained Columbia student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil, who came up in New York City’s mayoral debate last night ahead of a primary election this month. This is one of the leading contenders, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani.', 'ZOHRAN MAMDANI: He should be set free. He should be at home with his wife Noor and their young child. And the fact that he is still in Louisiana is an abomination. It’s an attack on our First Amendment. And it is clear, another example of Donald Trump weaponizing the very real issue of antisemitism to then throw Palestinian New Yorkers into detention facilities and not even tell us what the crime is that they’re charge with.', 'AMY GOODMAN: That’s Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who’s currently polling second to former New York [state] Governor Andrew Cuomo, who notably echoed Mamdani and agreed Mahmoud Khalil should be released from detention and, quote, “shouldn’t have been detained in the first place,” unquote. This is a change from Cuomo’s response to Khalil’s detention in March, when he didn’t call for the Trump administration to release him and also criticized what he called the antisemitic agitators at Columbia. Tell us the latest. You represent Mahmoud Khalil. Talk about what’s happening in immigration court in Louisiana and federal court in New Jersey.', 'BAHER AZMY: Yeah. Thanks, Amy, for bringing this up.', 'Yeah, Mahmoud Khalil is one of a number of student protesters who were targeted by ICE. And we’re nearing, almost to the day, the three-month anniversary of his arrest and abduction by ICE officers in front of his eight-month — then-eight-month-pregnant wife and spirited off to our immigration gulags in Louisiana, a private detention facility in the middle of Louisiana, five hours from New Orleans and 1,500 miles from his family.', 'We have a team of lawyers challenging his detention in two forums. In the immigration court, where the Department of Homeland Security is suggesting he is detainable and can be deported because the secretary of state, Rubio, has determined, in an utterly conclusory fashion, that his presence in the United States would be adverse to the foreign policy interests of the United States, and when that charge became vulnerable, they added some pretextual and made-up charges suggesting some misrepresentation on his application. In the immigration court, it appears that the Homeland Security has all but abandoned the claim of misrepresentation, because it’s factually preposterous, and it’s just doubling down on this really chilling Rubio finding that he and other students are deportable just simply on the Dear Leader’s say-so, a kind of Soviet-style diktat.', 'And so, separately, we are in federal court in New Jersey challenging the legality, that the unconstitutionality of the Rubio determination is a violation of the First Amendment, and because it’s so void — so vague that no — that it violates basic principles of due process. A district court judge last week found that the Rubio determination as applied to Mahmoud is likely unconstitutional. It’s so vague and indecipherable that it, you know, can’t stand constitutional muster, and invited his lawyers to submit evidence on other questions before the court — namely, how is this causing him harm, and what is in the public interest? And last night, we filed an avalanche of evidence on those two points, that we’ll be making public later this afternoon.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Baher Azmy, we want to thank you for being with us. We’ll cover your 2 p.m. news conference, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which challenged the first Trump travel ban, along with others, part of the legal team representing Columbia student protest leader, still detained, Mahmoud Khalil.', 'When we come back, the U.S. has once again vetoed a U.N.

It has sought to revoke his green card and deport him based on a rarely-used provision of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which empowers Rubio to expel someone from the country if their activities and beliefs are considered adverse to U.S. foreign policy interests, which in Khalil’s case, pertains to U.S. support for Israel.', 'Khalil’s case in New Jersey challenging the legality of his detention is playing out separately from his immigration case in Louisiana.', 'In April, the immigration judge ordered his deportation in finding the government had met its burden, a decision he intends to appeal. The federal New Jersey judge, Michael Farbiarz, has said he cannot be deported while his habeas corpus matter plays out.', 'Agents from the Department of Homeland Security took Khalil into custody on March 8 as he arrived home to his Columbia-owned apartment with his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, from an iftar dinner. He was brought to lower Manhattan’s 26 Federal Plaza for processing, driven to a facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, overnight, and transported more than 1,000 miles away to Jena, Louisiana, the next morning, a Sunday, where he has since remained incarcerated at a detention center.', 'In a ruling last week, Farbiarz, who is yet to rule on the legality of Khalil’s detention, said the government’s reasoning for seeking to deport him is likely unconstitutional.', '“Our law asks about an ‘ordinary person.’ Would he know that [the rarely-used provision] could be used against him based on his speech inside the United States, however odious it might allegedly have been — speech that has not been affirmatively determined by the Secretary to have an impact on U.S. relations with other countries? The Court’s answer is no,” Farbiarz wrote.', 'In Khalil’s parallel immigration case, the judge, Jamee Comans, last month heard testimony from the student activist and several experts who said his deportation could result in his kidnapping, torture, or even death due to his prominent criticism of Israel.', 'Comans denied a renewed motion to end the deportation proceedings based on agents’ failure to provide a warrant upon his arrest, The New York Times reported, and reserved issuing a decision on his bid for asylum.', 'In the filings made public Thursday, Khalil’s lawyers asked for permission to file under seal an expert declaration outlining the extreme psychological harm he’s endured from the “shock of unjust arrest and continued detention and family separation,” which they say “will inevitably severely worsen absent release.” A judge gave government lawyers until Friday to object to filing the assessment under seal.', '“These harms include the loss of Mr. Khalil’s liberty; the chilling of his First Amendment protected activities; the separation from his family, particularly his wife and newborn child; and psychological harm specific to his arrest and detention,” Khalil’s lawyers wrote.', 'A Palestinian who was raised in a refugee camp in Syria, Khalil came to the U.S. in December 2022 on a student visa, married Abdalla, who’s from the Midwest, in November 2023, and became a lawful permanent resident in 2024.', 'He completed his Master’s degree at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs in December and would have graduated last month. Abdalla accepted his diploma on his behalf a month after giving birth to their first child, a baby boy.', 'With experience working for a British embassy and interning with the United Nations in New York, Khalil was selected to play the role of a mediator and negotiator between the university’s administration and students during campus protests last year against Israel’s war on Gaza and Columbia’s ties to the Israeli regime.', 'Donald Trump and his Cabinet members have repeatedly characterized Khalil’s advocacy and criticism of Israel in general as antisemitic and inherently supportive of Hamas. The Trump administration has since targeted hundreds of international students for their advocacy for Gazans and criticism of Israeli military activity.', 'Khalil has denounced antisemitism, and in his public-facing role speaking to media on behalf of protesters before his arrest, he repeatedly maintained that the movement should advocate for justice and equality for all groups, telling CNN in April 2024, “As a Palestinian student, I believe that the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand and you cannot achieve one without the other.”', '_____']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTZPUzFhZEVaRGEzZENXRWd5VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhbGhZek9zUVk=-w280-h168-p-df
