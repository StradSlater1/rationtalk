Try The Block’s hiring tool for free today.', 'It appears not everyone is happy with Circle’s overperforming initial public offering. According to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer for crypto asset manager Arca, the firm received a fraction of its intended investment in CRCL, the newly listed shares for the newly public firm Circle. ', 'Circle Internet Group listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, marking one of the best public debuts of the year. The firm and executives, including CEO Jeremy Allaire, sold 34 million IPO shares for $31 per share, raising over $1 billion. ', 'CRCL opened at a price of $69 per share and is currently trading at over $85, representing an increase of more than 175% over its listing price. CRCL traded as high as $90 on Thursday. ', 'Dorman said Arca placed an order to invest $10 million in CRCL IPO shares months ago on “Day 1” of Circle’s roadshow. However, the firm received “a measly” $135,000 allocation, or just 1.35% of its order, according to a post on X.', '“You decide to give fat allocations to TradFi mutual funds and hedge funds who likely didn’t even read your prospectus, have no wallets, and will never use your product,” Dorman wrote in a public letter — titled “F*ck you!” — posted to X. ', 'Circle’s round was oversubscribed and upsized at least twice. The firm initially intended to sell shares for around $25 and later said it would seek to sell 32 million shares for between $27 and $28. ', 'Typically, when funding rounds or public listings are oversubscribed, investors will not always receive their promised allocations. The Block has reached out to Circle and Arca for comment. ', '“I cannot believe our efforts to help you grow for years culminated in you giving us a joke, throwaway allocation. You are the first and only crypto company who has EVER treated Arca this way,” Dorman added. ', 'According to Dorman, Arca has been a longstanding customer and occasional partner of Circle, and even allegedly assisted the firm “through tough times like the March 2023 banking crisis” when USDC depegged from the U.S. dollar. ', 'Circle is the second pure-play crypto firm to go public in the U.S., following in the footsteps of the firm’s close partner, Coinbase, which pursued a direct listing in 2021. Circle had attempted to go public through a SPAC merger, which was called off during the 2022 market downturn. ', '""You and Coinbase deserve each other,"" wrote Dorfman, ""a match made in heaven of two incompetent management teams who were early, but screw up everything you touch.""', 'Dorman said Arca would close its current Circle accounts and begin using rival stablecoins, such as USDT.', '""If you want to see how irrelevant and generic your product has become, this is a decision that was easy to make and doesn’t affect our business one bit because there are perfect substitutes everywhere,"" he said.

As of reporting on Friday (June 6), Circle’s share price was up to $111.', 'What’s powering the rise? Among the key uses cases beyond crypto market trading, cross-border transactions may top the list from a proof-of-concept standpoint.', 'For instance, BVNK and LianLian Global have partnered to facilitate stablecoin-powered cross-border payments. Merchants can deposit stablecoins, which are then automatically converted to U.S. dollars and routed through LianLian’s extensive network, significantly reducing settlement times from days to minutes.', 'Similarly, Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins for international money transfers. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted their potential to reduce costs and improve efficiency in cross-border transactions, making them an attractive option for global operations.', 'PYMNTS covered how small banks can often face challenges in offering competitive cross-border payment services due to reliance on intermediaries and outdated infrastructure. Stablecoins and digital wallets offer a solution by enabling faster, lower-cost and more transparent international transactions.', 'Beyond consumer payments, stablecoins are making inroads into B2B transactions. As of early 2025, B2B stablecoin transactions accounted for $36 billion, surpassing peer-to-peer and card-linked uses.', 'The appeal lies in the speed, cost-efficiency and stability stablecoins can offer, particularly in regions where traditional banking systems are less reliable. In Latin America and Africa, businesses are leveraging stablecoins to sidestep currency devaluation and cross-border delays, replacing cumbersome wire networks with faster, more efficient alternatives.', 'See also: Making Stablecoins ‘Grandma-Friendly’', 'Large and global financial institutions are also eyeing the potential of stablecoins. Deutsche Bank, for example, is exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits.', 'Even mainstream consumer-facing platforms are joining the conversation. Airbnb is reportedly engaging in pilot discussions. And Apple and Google Cloud, while not launching tokens themselves, are participating in early-stage forums around how stablecoins might integrate with their cloud payment services.', 'On the regulatory front, the U.S. government is moving toward establishing a framework for these digital currencies. Legislation under consideration would require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, enhancing their legitimacy and potentially increasing demand for government debt.', 'In this model, money isn’t just a medium of exchange — it becomes a piece of software for business transactions.', 'Read also: Going From Zero to Crypto: How Banks and PSPs Can Approach Stablecoins', 'But the potential of this currency comes with equally sizable risk.

Market interest caused the stock to surge so much that it was paused for volatility shortly after being listed. CRCL’s share price ultimately closed at $83.23, pushing the company’s value north of $18 billion.', 'The stablecoin issuer’s direct listing sees it join other firms such as Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S.', 'But Circle’s debut represents more than a successful fundraising event.

While USDC’s scale is still dwarfed by Tether’s USDT, USDC is widely regarded as the more transparent and regulation-friendly option. That reputation has helped Circle build deep relationships with both FinTech upstarts and legacy institutions.', '“Our transformation into being a public company is a significant and powerful milestone — the world is ready to start upgrading and moving to the internet financial system,” said Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire.', '“From inception, we have been deeply focused on being trusted, transparent, compliant, ethical and well governed. Holding ourselves to the high standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and regulations further deepens those attributes.”', 'The company’s revenue model largely centers around interest earned on its reserve holdings. In 2024 alone, Circle reported $1.7 billion in revenue — a number driven by rising interest rates, increased adoption of USDC in global payments, and growing use among institutional clients.', 'The implications of Circle’s IPO are far-reaching. First, it lends unprecedented credibility to the stablecoin market. By successfully listing on the NYSE and attracting underwriters such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup, Circle has sent a strong signal to Wall Street: Stablecoins are not only here to stay, but they are also investable, scalable financial products with real-world utility.', 'This public listing offers increased transparency into Circle’s operations, governance and financials, which may set a new industry standard. Investors now have the ability to scrutinize Circle through quarterly reports, SEC filings and earnings calls — levels of visibility previously unavailable in the stablecoin space.', 'Read more: Crypto Rulemaking Has FinTech Rushing in, TradFi Waiting to See', 'One of the key advantages of going public is the enhanced regulatory clarity it affords. By becoming a publicly traded company, Circle must comply with a higher standard of regulatory oversight, including audits, disclosures, and governance practices. This alignment with U.S. financial norms could make Circle a preferred partner for banks, FinTechs and governments exploring stablecoin use cases.', 'Despite the fanfare, Circle faces several challenges. First, the stablecoin market is becoming competitive. Those very same blue chip banks that helped take Circle public are themselves considering becoming stablecoin issuers.

Late last month, it was announced that the Circle Payments Network (CPN) is now live, enabling stablecoin-powered cross-border payments.', 'At the same time, the integration of stablecoins into the mainstream financial system is not without friction. Issues around consumer protection, systemic risk, and monetary policy remain unresolved.', 'Ultimately, however, Circle’s IPO is not just a financial milestone; it’s a statement of intent.

It has expanded its stock offering for a second time and also raised the maximum offer price to $31. Circle and existing investors had planned to sell a combined maximum of 36.8 million shares but they expanded that by 2.3 million yesterday, including an underwriter’s option to buy 5.1 million. That means that the company and investors will raise up to $1.2 billion, which would give the company a market capitalization of just over $7 billion. Amid this good news there is a surprising finding that the company’s Chief Financial Officer, has chosen to cash out three quarters of his stock.', 'Update: By lunchtime on the opening day the price was around 85 cents compared to 31 cents, valuing the firm at more than $19 billion.', 'Circle is the second largest stablecoin issuer with its USDC having an issuance of $61.5 billion compared to market leader Tether with $153.7 billion. Currently these are the two dominant players, but they have very different market positions. Circle wants USDC to be onshore and regulated, whereas Tether is currently offshore and has withdrawn from the EU.', 'This market position, combined with the capital and acquisition flexibility that comes from going public, positions Circle to expand through acquisition. The stablecoin issuer doesn’t see its role as only fulfilling the basics. Apart from issuing its stablecoins on numerous blockchains, it provides a wallet solution and more recently launched the Circle Payments Network, aiming to provide banking on- and off-ramps, FX and currency liquidity. It’s a big step toward vertical integration. We can expect the company to use its newly listed stock as a means to flesh out that strategy.', 'While Circle positions itself for growth, the IPO has crystallized substantial personal wealth for its leadership team.', 'The company operates with two share classes, with Class B shares carrying special voting rights that account for 30% of all votes. Only founders Jeremy Allaire and P. Sean Neville hold Class B shares, with Allaire controlling 77.1% of this voting bloc. Despite selling $49 million worth of shares in the IPO, Allaire retains stock valued at $580 million.', 'Among the senior leadership team, President and Chief Legal Officer Heath Tarbert – former CFTC Chair under the first Trump administration – has built significant equity since joining Circle two years ago. His current holdings are worth $26 million, excluding stock options.', 'Chief Technology and Product Officer Nikhil Chandhok doubled his planned stock sale during the IPO process, ultimately selling shares worth $18.6 million and reducing his total holdings by 31%. His remaining stake is valued at $42 million.', 'The most dramatic selloff came from Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Green. While Circle’s prospectus initially indicated Fox-Green owned 1.6 million shares and planned to sell just 200,000, recent beneficial holdings disclosures reveal he actually sold approximately 1.2 million shares, representing three quarters of his total position.', 'The transaction netted Fox-Green roughly $37 million, which reduced his direct holdings to 405,000 shares. While it’s common for executives to sell portions of their stock during IPOs, Fox-Green’s actual sale was six times larger than his originally disclosed plan – a significant departure from stated intentions.', 'Copyright © 2018 - 2025 Ledger Insights Ltd.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVZOV3RsYm1SS01FTjBlVlZ5VFJDSEF4aVBCaWdLTWdrQkFJeXVzZVhJQVFN=-w280-h168-p-df
