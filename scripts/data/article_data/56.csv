Stars fire coach Pete DeBoer after losing in the West finals,https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45464246/stars-fire-coach-pete-deboer-losing-west-final,"['', '', '', 'Eight days after falling in their third straight Western Conference finals, the Dallas Stars announced Friday they fired head coach Peter DeBoer.', 'DeBoer, who had a year remaining on his contract, had his future with the franchise come under question after the Stars lost to the Edmonton Oilers in five games.', '""After careful consideration, we believe that a new voice is needed in our locker room to push us closer to our goal of winning the Stanley Cup,"" Stars general manager Jim Nill said in a statement. ""We\'d like to thank Pete for everything that he has helped our organization achieve over the past three seasons and wish him nothing but the best moving forward.""', 'The Stars opened Game 5 by watching franchise goaltender Jake Oettinger give up two goals on his first two shots to fall into a 2-0 deficit. DeBoer pulled Oettinger in favor of Casey DeSmith hoping it would wake the team up. The Stars pulled within a goal twice but lost 6-3.', '""Any time you pull a goalie the reasoning is to always try and spark your group,"" DeBoer said after Game 5. ""So that\'s for your first reason. We had talked endlessly in this series about trying to play with the lead, and obviously, we\'re in a 2-0 hole right away. I didn\'t take that lightly, and I didn\'t blame it all on Jake. But the reality is, if you go back to last year\'s playoffs, he\'s lost six of seven games to Edmonton.""', 'The statement led to even more questions about his relationship with Oettinger, who is one of the biggest reasons why the Stars have emerged as a perennial Stanley Cup favorite over the past three seasons.', 'Especially with Oettinger set to enter the first year of an eight-year contract extension that will see him go from earning $4 million to $8.25 million annually.', 'DeBoer doubled down on his decision to pull Oettinger two days later during the team\'s season-ending media availability. He said that there isn\'t ""a bigger fan"" of Oettinger than himself, later adding that he hadn\'t spoken to the 26-year-old netminder.', ""Oettinger, who didn't speak after Game 5, also spoke in the same availability."", '""The reality is if I make one or two or two of those saves, then I\'m still playing in the game,"" Oettinger said. ""The way I\'m looking at it is, how can I get better from that? How can I make those saves that I made all playoffs?""', 'Oettinger was also asked if he had any concerns about his relationship with DeBoer.', '""My job is to stop the puck. And I feel like I\'m one of the best in the world, when I\'m playing well, doing that. So that\'s all I\'m in a focus on,"" Oettinger said. ""All the extra stuff is just extra stuff to me. ... If I go out there next year and I\'m the best goalie in the world, it doesn\'t matter. One of you guys could be coaching, it doesn\'t matter. Just try to be the best I can be, learn from the experience.""', ""The Stars had no comment about DeBoer's handling of Oettinger, but the results are what they are. Dallas joined the 1975-77 Islanders as the only teams in the expansion era to lose in the round before the Stanley Cup Final for three straight seasons."", ""The Stars' need for a new coach will now reignite a coaching carousel that appeared to have come to a full stop Thursday with the Boston Bruins hiring former forward Marco Sturm."", 'The Stars now become the ninth team this offseason to seek a head coach in a cycle that saw Mike Sullivan leave the Pittsburgh Penguins to join the New York Rangers, Joel Quenneville sign with the Anaheim Ducks and Rick Tocchet depart the Vancouver Canucks for the Philadelphia Flyers.', ""Hiring a new coach also comes in an offseason in which PuckPedia projects the Stars will have $4.955 million in cap space to address a roster that has seven pending unrestricted free agents.

Stars Fire Pete DeBoer,https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/2025/06/stars-fire-pete-deboer.html,"['Pro Hockey Rumors', 'JUNE 6, 2025 AT 9:33 AM CDT | BY JOSH ERICKSON 45 COMMENTS', 'The Stars announced Friday they’ve fired head coach Pete DeBoer. He had one year left on his contract worth roughly $4MM, Tim Cowlishaw of the Dallas Morning News relayed yesterday. With no other head coaching vacancies after the Bruins filled theirs yesterday, they’ll be paying him to sit unless he lands a job with another club thanks to an in-season coaching change in 2025-26.', '“After careful consideration, we believe that a new voice is needed in our locker room to push us closer to our goal of winning the Stanley Cup,” general manager Jim Nill said in a team release. “We’d like to thank Pete for everything that he has helped our organization achieve over the past three seasons and wish him nothing but the best moving forward.”', 'If DeBoer sits at home for the entirety of next season, it’ll be the first NHL campaign without him leading a team’s bench since he first entered the league as head coach of the Panthers in 2008. He’s been a fixture for nearly two decades, and for good reason. DeBoer-coached teams have made the playoffs nine out of the last 10 seasons, and he’s advanced to the third round in six straight postseason appearances.', 'Those clubs, including Dallas for the last three years, have lost every one of those six Conference Finals/Semi-Finals, though. That’s the impetus behind today’s coaching change as the Stars look to get over the hump, although they were likely pushed in this direction by the specific circumstances of how their season ended in Game 5 of the Western Conference Final against the Oilers.', 'DeBoer pulled star goaltender Jake Oettinger from the game after two defensive breakdowns led to a pair of early Edmonton goals, and continued to justify his decision postgame despite his offense going completely dark for most of the series. Dallas scored 11 times in the five-game loss, but six of those goals came in a Game 1 blowout. They averaged just 1.25 goals per game as they lost four straight to end their season.', 'His decision to remove Oettinger from the game reportedly caused a high degree of frustration within the organization. If the relationship between DeBoer and Oettinger was fractured beyond repair, moving on from the former was the slam-dunk decision. Oettinger, who will presumably finish top-10 in year-end All-Star voting for the third year in a row, signed an eight-year, $66MM extension last October that doesn’t kick in until next season.', 'Goaltending drama aside, moving on from DeBoer is arguably the most seismic coaching move of the offseason, along with the Penguins’ dismissal of Mike Sullivan. The Stars had a 149-68-29 (.665) record in his three seasons as head coach, the best record in the league since his hiring. While Dallas didn’t convert on any of its WCF appearances, their streak of three straight third-round showings tied the franchise record set from 1998 to 2000.', 'With his Stars tenure now behind him, DeBoer is up to 17th on the NHL coach all-time wins list with 662. The 56-year-old has an all-time regular-season record of 662-447-152 (.525) across stops in Florida, New Jersey, San Jose, Vegas, and Dallas and has advanced to the third round in eight of his 17 years as an NHL head coach.', 'It’s unclear what DeBoer’s firing means for the Stars’ assistant coaches, particularly Misha Donskov and Steve Spott. The two have worked closely with DeBoer over the last several years and followed him from Nevada to Texas. He had not previously overlapped with the Stars’ third assistant, Alain Nasreddine.', 'Image courtesy of Jerome Miron-Imagn Images.', 'DALLAS STARS| NEWSSTAND\nPETER DEBOER', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Pro Hockey Rumors is not affiliated with National Hockey League, NHL or NHL.com', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNU1SV1ptV1VWWGFuRnJXV1IzVFJEcUFSaWdBeWdLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

In that game DeBoer pulled his starting goalie Jake Oettinger after the goalie allowed two goals on two shots, and did so in dramatic fashion during a timeout, before doubling down on his decision after the game.', 'After that loss Stars owner Tom Gaglardi told the Dallas Morning News that in his view, at that time, firing DeBoer wouldn’t make much sense and the coach was one of the top coaches in the NHL.', 'Shap Shots is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.', 'Then the Stars had a day to cool off after losing Game 5 and held exit interviews on Saturday. Players met with management, players and DeBoer also addressed the media, where we learned that since the pull, the Stars head coach had not yet had the time to speak with Oettinger.', 'To me, that was one of the most damning things, which I wrote about in D Magazine earlier this week.', 'Make no mistake, the 26-year-old is a professional. He won’t poison the water for DeBoer of his own accord. But there is a very real chance the coach just lost one of his most important allies heading into the final year of his contract, when he’ll be fighting to secure his own future in Dallas.', 'Maybe DeBoer was right to pull Oettinger. Maybe he wasn’t. But if someone else is coaching the Stars in 2027, the decision to change goalies won’t play a part in why. Everything DeBoer has done afterward might.', 'Around the same time we also started to see some smoke come out Stars camps.', 'There were reports that players were unhappy with DeBoer’s decisions and how he handled things.', 'I’ve since learned that Oettinger wasn’t the pushing any buttons to remover DeBoer, but his teammates looked at his public in-game crucification as a rallying point. Taking the shot at Oettinger and not taking the time to talk with him, opened up the floodgates for others to air their grievances.', 'It created a space where Stars GM Jim Nill was now in a spot to do something he’s never done during his time in Dallas — think about firing a coach for hockey-related reasons1.', 'Nill and Gaglardi met to discuss this on Wednesday, a meeting that we can assume tackled the question of “can Pete DeBoer win a Stanley Cup?”', 'And on Friday morning, we learned there answer.', '“After careful consideration, we believe that a new voice is needed in our locker room to push us closer to our goal of winning the Stanley Cup,” Nill said in the press release. “We’d like to thank Pete for everything that he has helped our organization achieve over the past three seasons and wish him nothing but the best moving forward.”', 'A coach getting fired tends to loosen lips for sources. So I want to tread carefully here, but there were multiple people familiar with the Stars coaching staff situation that opened up a bit after the move was made official.', 'DeBoer is a good coach, let’s not mince words there, but he’s a very stubborn one who wants things done his way. Steve Spott, who I assume will also be let go, is his “yes, man,” that has made a career out of helping DeBoer connect with other members of the staff.', 'DeBoer takes ideas from those he respects, but the problem is he often takes longer to develop that respect, and sometimes there’s even questions of how someone can earn his respect in the first place.', 'This can work to an extent and it’s why the Stars have been successful the past three seasons, but it’s also the reason that DeBoer can be exposed under the microscope. When the entire world is watching, and you are the smartest person in the room, it would probably help to listen to some additional opinions to help yourself.', 'Again, it’s easy for people to take potshots at a coach on the way out, but it’s also something that has bubbled under the surface and is reflective of DeBoer’s shelf life at other stops in his NHL career.', 'DeBoer is very similar to a task master manager in soccer, someone who can win and drive a team to the next step, but might not have the staying power because of his abrasiveness and how he wears on teams.', 'The question, which Nill will start addressing this afternoon in a press conference, is where do the Stars go from here.', 'There aren’t many “veteran” coaches that don’t fit the same profile as DeBoer. Gerard Gallant, for example, is just DeBoer in different skin, a veteran and abrasive coach that tends to have a shelf life.', 'The Stars also have a promising young coach in the AHL right now with Neil Graham, who currently has the Texas Stars in the Western Conference Final, but Graham has never coached an NHL game, even as an assistant, and doesn’t fit the “experience” profile that Gaglardi might want for a team that is still a legit Stanley Cup contender.', 'My first thought goes to Karl Taylor, currently the AHL coach for the Milwaukee Admirals, who is similar to Graham, but also doesn’t have NHL experience.', 'Former Dallas Stars coach Glen Gulutzan should also be considered. Gulutzan has been one of the NHL’s best assistants the past couple seasons and has helped eliminate the Stars in back-to-back years with the Edmonton Oilers.', 'Someone from the coaching world immediately texted me Friday morning banging the table for Gulutzan.', 'Current Stars assistant coach Alain Nasreddine could also get an interview.', 'The Stars should also at least call David Carle at the University of Denver, as any NHL team should do if they have an opening.', 'Either way, it’s a big decision for Dallas.

It was partly to spark our team and wake them up, but also knowing that the status quo had not been working. That’s a pretty big sample size.”', 'In three seasons with the Stars, the 56-year-old DeBoer recorded a 149-68-29 record in 246 regular-season games. He led the team to three consecutive Western Conference Final appearances, posting a 29-27 record in 56 playoff games.', 'Earlier in the playoffs, DeBoer became the first coach or manager in North American professional sports history to earn nine Game 7 victories, doing so after the Stars defeated the Colorado Avalanche 4-2 in Game 7 of their first-round matchup.

It’s always the cover-up or how you handle the challenge your actions created that gets you bounced in this business or almost any other.', '', 'In the news conference maybe a half hour after the final whistle, DeBoer said, “You know, he lost six of the last seven games to Edmonton,” a personal charge against his goaltender. It’s not that it wasn’t true, but DeBoer also lost those games and so did Miro Heiskanen and — not just Oettinger.

But it’s also a considerable risk to move on from a proven coach who led this team to three straight Western Conference finals, who manages to win every seventh game (9-0) his team faces. DeBoer leaves in a cloud of turbulence, but an element of his coaching had a calming aspect of its own that should not be readily dismissed.', 'The Stars could go any number of directions for his replacement, but a person close to the situation said it will not be a retread.

DeBoer’s fate was discussed but has not been resolved. That leads me to believe he’s not coming back. The owner said the day after the Stars’ 6-3 loss eliminated them from the playoffs that he couldn’t imagine having to make a decision on his head coach.', 'Things change.', ""Get the latest D-FW sports news, analysis and opinion delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, Kevin Sherrington's A La Carte."", 'Or with:', 'By signing up you agree to our \nTerms of Service\n and \nPrivacy Policy', 'All indications are that several players spoke out against DeBoer in their exit interviews. His benching of goaltender Jake Oettinger just seven minutes and two goals into Game 5 was their principal concern but not their only one. On top of that, DeBoer was almost flippant two days later when he said he hadn’t talked to Oettinger and asked if he needed to worry about his relationship with other players he might have benched or demoted at various times.', 'This, I’m afraid, is what is going to get DeBoer fired with a year remaining on his contract. I wouldn’t do it, but, somehow, I’m not in charge. In three seasons here, all he has done is guide the Stars to three conference finals. Right now there are raw feelings about losing in five games, about not getting past those conference finals one more time, but think about this for a second. Florida is the only other team that has made it to the conference finals each of the last three seasons. The Panthers are the reigning kings of hockey and we will soon find out if they can repeat against Edmonton.', 'Dallas is in the class right below these two teams. Third out of 32? I’ll take that along with some occasionally petulant behavior from my head coach 100 times out of 100.', 'The players might be mad at DeBoer today but he’s just the easy way out. What about looking in the mirror? What about the fact he’s not wrong about Oettinger’s three Western Conference finals — a 6-12 record overall and an .853 save percentage against the Oilers this year? What about the goal scorers who vanished and left the team hopeless in the final round?', 'Players are young. They move on. They care about other things. As for Oettinger, his eight-year $66 million guaranteed contract kicks into gear in October. If he still needs a little extra fuel for any reason, motivation to prove his coach made a terrible mistake has been used effectively in the past.', 'In the spring of 1996, my first year on the Stars beat, the club was eliminated from any playoff hopes with a loss in Winnipeg. They scored just 66 points as a last-place team, a far cry from the 100-plus that is anticipated here now. There was plenty of yelling in the locker room after the game, although those of us on the other side of the door could not hear exactly what was said. It was directed at their new coach, Ken Hitchcock. The players couldn’t stand him, didn’t respect him the way they had with Bob Gainey.', 'I couldn’t imagine that Hitch had much future in Dallas.', 'The next year they went from last to first in the division. The next three seasons they went at least to the conference finals and, of course, won the Stanley Cup in 1999. Some players never cared for Hitch the entire time although winning made it a secondary emotion.', 'Not every team wins with a player’s coach, although that is the popular route these days; players are more empowered than ever. DeBoer made a mistake by not going back to Oettinger after the first period of Game 5. The message would have been sent, the game was still 3-1 — who knows what might have happened? I suspect the Oilers would have won the game and certainly they would have still won the series, but there would be less sound and fury over the benching of the team’s beloved young goaltender.', 'I’m not saying that’s the only mistake DeBoer ever made with his team or with the media. But if I’ve got a guy who has coached in 101, 101 and 100 games the last three seasons, I’m not kicking him to the curb for an untimely decision, even in a big game. Let’s be honest, Edmonton was going to win that series no matter what anyone did on this side of the ice.', 'Players and coaches both can learn from mistakes. After Game 5 against Edmonton a year ago — another defeat but one that left the Stars with a game to play — DeBoer took out his wrath on a popular, decorated Dallas columnist (pardon the adjectives) and told him to write whatever the (heck) he wanted.', 'This year he took it out on Oettinger.

They also won six playoff series, defeating Colorado twice, Vegas and Winnipeg, but losing to Edmonton in each of the past two seasons.

I don’t think he handled that the way he wanted to. But you have to remember you’re under the duress of everything going on in that.”', 'Nill had postseason reviews with all of the players and said that helped make the decision.', '“What I do at the end of every season, players deserve to be heard,” Nill said. “I’ve been in the business a long time and I interview all of the players and tell them to be truthful with me. But I’ve also been around long enough to know that if a guy is only getting five minutes of ice time, he’s not going to like the coach. I understand that. I take it all in, analyze it and we talk about it internally. Some of it comes into play, some of it doesn’t. You have to really balance those things.”', 'DeBoer has one year left on his contract.

"Pete DeBoer, and how NHL coaches have been sapped of all authority",https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/pete-deboer-and-how-nhl-coaches-have-been-sapped-of-all-authority/,"['', '', '', '', 'There was an era when NHL coaches had all the power. They ran their teams like jockeys atop thoroughbreds, providing vague directional guidance and motivation. No carrots and all sticks. As the one doing the work, if you didn’t like a coach, your choices were either learn to like them or fall in line.', 'Players fell in line.', 'Coaches dictated ice time and linemates just as they do now, collectively known as “opportunity,” and so without their earned approval (and the reciprocal of those good slots), your career could end before it even started. They were in charge, and they treated players accordingly.', ""As player salaries ticked up, team owners were forced to see those players more as investments — superstars were the blue-chip stocks that could guarantee fans, wins and stable returns. Coaches' salaries didn’t rise at a commensurate pace, which led to what seemed to be a collective epiphany from owners that maybe the jockey matters less than the horses. Which, sure, they were right. When those two factions had a dispute, the jockey used to have the final say. But eventually, if the horse was good enough — and contentious enough — we started to see that change."", '', '', '', '', 'As the era of player empowerment has gone on, this has been a mostly good thing for teams and a purely good thing for the morale and treatment of the players. It’s gotten comfy. A few particularly stick-heavy coaches were forced to temper their behaviours (which is good!), many of that class found it tougher to gain employment, and more than anything, owners and GMs came to view them as disposable.', 'Years later, with the flat salary cap, the turnover would be comical if it weren’t so detrimental to teams. Players make so much money, and the flat cap has meant that moving players has been extremely challenging. And so, firing the coach has been the easiest way to make a change. With 31 teams now not winning the Stanley Cup, a lot of them want change. That’s brought us to the point where the average NHL coaching tenure lasts less than three seasons.', 'This has led to just about every coach being viewed as a lame duck before they pin up a calendar in their new office, regardless of their contract status. The players, not even just the stars anymore, have been able to steel themselves against some short-term punishments, knowing if they just dig in (and don’t change) for a half a season or so, that the guy they don’t like will likely be gone anyway. All the while, failing teams get to tell their fans “see, we’re trying” every time they fire the next coach.', ""And of course, that lame duck status has been brutal for coaches' ability to get results, particularly combined with the level of ego and entitlement seen from some of today’s young stars."", 'It’s been said for years that today’s players need far more explaining about why a coach is making decisions, as opposed to the days of my co-host on Real Kyper and Bourne, Nick Kypreos, where he explains that you got the what and that was the end of that. You just did as you were told if you wanted that coveted opportunity. I saw the shift over my own playing career, which ended in 2009, but I’d argue the need for the why — admittedly not entirely a bad thing — has ramped up threefold since then.', 'Where it is a bad thing is that players don’t just want things explained to them so they get the why. Many also have to agree on the why to buy in, which is crucial in finding team success. With just about every coach working from lame duck status, if they get players who don’t agree, things get challenging.', ""Pete DeBoer was fired by the Dallas Stars on Friday, and from the outside, it looks like a scapegoating, ego-coddling decision. Now, I specify that’s from the outside. Maybe DeBoer's firing had nothing to do with his handling of Jake Oettinger in Game 5 against the Edmonton Oilers, maybe it had nothing to do with his post-game comments, and maybe there is clear and justifiable behind-the-scenes reasoning for his firing."", 'Or, maybe it has everything to do with it.', '', '', '', '', ""Again, from the outside, it looks like the Stars fell short again, but they’ve also been one of the NHL’s best teams every year that DeBoer has been there. They also lost to an Oilers team that's been crushing everyone, including other well-coached teams. And so from the outside, it seems like they didn’t like how DeBoer handled their star goalie, who’s under contract for many years to come. Firing the coach also redirects the blame from the GM, who makes the statement that the roster isn’t the problem."", 'But this Oettinger thing, I’m sorry — a coach seemingly can’t pull his goalie who gives up two goals on two shots in an elimination game? Or maybe he can’t give an accurate reflection of his (accurate and just) thought process into why he made the move, post-game?', ""You may not agree with what he said, and maybe Oettinger didn’t like it, and maybe he shouldn’t have said that part out loud. But when did players get elevated so far beyond criticism from their head coach that they can't work together productively?"", '', '', '', '', 'You see it all around the league, including where I am in Toronto, where head coach Craig Berube didn’t criticize a star player a single time in the media, because apparently, honesty and criticism are boards from which they eventually build your plank.', 'All of which makes coaching like playing Jenga. When every attempt to curb behaviours and get players to fall in line is seen as the removal of a piece from the bottom and stacked teetering and tottering on the top, criticism becomes too perilous. To continue mixing metaphors, you’ve got jockeys trying to control thoroughbreds using Twinkies and Skittles.', 'This is about DeBoer, sure, but it’s about coaching more generally. What do we want that role to be in the NHL? While I recognize DeBoer hasn’t won the Cup, he’s been awfully successful. Paul Maurice, for instance, was no different than DeBoer if you go back in time just one calendar year. A great coach who hadn’t yet won.', 'I was struck, when going back over the most recent Stanley Cup champions, by the names of the coaches. Let’s go back 10 years. We’ve got:', '2015: Joel Quenneville (Chicago Blackhawks)\n2016: Mike Sullivan (Pittsburgh Penguins)\n2017: Mike Sullivan (Pittsburgh Penguins)\n2018: Barry Trotz (Washington Capitals)\n2019: Craig Berube (St. Louis Blues)\n2020: Jon Cooper (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n2021: Jon Cooper (Tampa Bay Lightning)\n2022: Jared Bednar (Colorado Avalanche)\n2023: Bruce Cassidy (Vegas Golden Knights)\n2024: Paul Maurice (Florida Panthers)', 'These are mostly men who are extremely accomplished, authoritative coaches. Their past resumes command respect (to varying degrees), and by and large, they had established themselves and were able to coach free from fear.', 'Maybe DeBoer is in that class of coach, who knows he’ll have another job waiting, which is why he felt comfortable enough to give an honest review of Oettinger’s play and why he pulled him. Maybe that comfort and honesty contributed to his demise in Dallas. And maybe this isn’t about him, but about how hard coaching is in today’s NHL, given the role has been sapped of all authority.', 'Too much power proved itself a problem, and needed scaling back, of course. But this new thing, where coaches can barely do their jobs with any effectiveness, isn’t any good either. Give the players some credit, I’m sure they can handle some tough love without wilting.', 'A coach needs to be free to direct criticism and bench players without backlash. Their players need to know the coach is going to be around, whether they like it or not. They need to be able to ask for more. Without that, players will value them less.', 'COMMENTS', 'When submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid posting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.
