This is a great time for you to revamp your image or pitch your ideas, so get into the manifesting spirit and start dreaming bigger."", 'This could be an especially heavy full moon for you, Capricorn, as it lands in your 12th house of closure, healing, and the subconscious.

However, it will be best seen at moonrise on Tuesday, June 10 as it appears in the east during dusk. It takes its name from the ripening of summer berries in North America during June. It’s also the lowest-hanging full moon not only of the year, but since 2006 because of a once-in-18.6-years occurrence called the “major lunar standstill.”', 'The full Strawberry Moon sets behind the Statue of Liberty before sunrise on June 4, 2023, in New ...

Know how to harness its energy, too.', 'In mere days, a full moon will illuminate the night sky with a magnetic force that few will be able to ignore. This full moon on June 11, 2025 will occur in the sign of Sagittarius, bringing with it a wave of expansive energy, revealed truths and a desire for freedom. On an astrological level, it is one of the most significant full moons of the year, capable of activating profound internal processes and triggering important personal and collective turning points. But what can we really expect from this powerful movement from the Moon?', 'At 10:33 a.m. (ET) on June 11, 2025, the Moon will peak in the fire sign of Sagittarius, opposing the Sun in Gemini. This astrological axis is that of thought, knowledge, communication, and the search for meaning in life. Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, represents expansion, idealism, and spiritual adventure; the Sun in Gemini, on the other hand, symbolizes the need for information, rapid connections, and dialogue. The tension between these two poles will bring to light conflicts between what we believe and what we know, between intuition and rationality, between distant horizons and everyday reality.', 'In this context, the full moon in Sagittarius invites us to look beyond the limits of habitual experience. It is the ideal time to take stock of ourselves, to ask ourselves: Where are we going? What is really guiding us? What are the deep truths that we want to affirm in our lives? Below, more on the astrology behind this happening, which zodiac signs will be most affected, and how to harness the energy from the strawberry moon.', 'The signs most involved in this full moon of June 2025 will naturally be Sagittarius and Gemini, but also Virgo and Pisces, who will experience the full moon in tension. For those born in Sagittarius it will be a moment of maximum emotional exposure: truths could emerge that will force them to redefine a path. Gemini, opposite to the moon , will feel the need to find coherence between mind and heart. Virgo and Pisces, involved in a square aspect, will be pushed to let go of rigidity and find a broader vision of reality.', 'On the contrary, the signs of Aries, Leo, Aquarius, and Libra could benefit from this energy, finding enthusiasm, new ideas and a renewed confidence in the future. Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio and Capricorn, on the other hand, will experience the full moon in a more neutral but no less significant way: for them it will be about subtle reflections, less flashy, but profoundly transformative.', ""Full moons are always great times to let go of what no longer serves us. With this Moon in Sagittarius, the dominant theme is the release of limiting beliefs. It's a time to break old thought patterns, abandon ideologies that no longer resonate with our growth, and open up to new worldviews."", 'A simple but powerful ritual is to write down on a piece of paper all the beliefs, ideas or situations that we feel are now outdated, and then burn it safely as a symbolic act of liberation. Moonlight meditation, combined with visualization or journaling techniques, can also help integrate the insights of this period.', 'Astrologically, this full moon will be free from hard aspects to the slow-moving planets, but will receive symbolic influences from Jupiter in Gemini, Saturn retrograde in Pisces, and Neptune still in its last degrees in Pisces. Jupiter, ruler of Sagittarius, is in the opposite sign, making the desire for truth even more urgent but also more difficult to grasp. We may feel torn between the need to know everything and the need to believe in something.', 'Saturn retrograde and Neptune in Pisces instead speak of blurred boundaries, illusions and spirituality. This tells us that the full moon will not only bring rational revelations, but also more subtle, visceral understandings, which may emerge through dreams, intuitions or synchronicities. It is a moon that asks us to trust our intuition as much as our analytical mind.', 'It is no coincidence that the full moon of June 11, 2025 falls precisely at a time when, collectively, many are seeking new directions. Sagittarius is linked to freedom of thought, philosophy, and global justice. This full moon could coincide with world events in which transparency and honesty are placed at the center of public debate, or in which the issues of travel, migration, education, and human rights become urgent.', 'It is also an ideal time to begin a course of study, plan a trip, or simply open up to cultures, spiritualities, and worldviews different from your own.

Download the app.', 'The full Moon brings powerful change and transformation. The brightest night of the lunar cycle, the full Moon leaves no shadows to hide in. This is your moment to release what no longer serves you. The upcoming full Moon in Sagittarius, specifically, is a time to release self-judgment and feel the adventure of living. It’s up to you to decide what you want to shift and allow the Moon to help you make these changes.', 'The upcoming full Moon, also known as the Strawberry Moon, takes place on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, at 12:44 am PT.', 'Sagittarius is the eternal student of the zodiac, forever in search of new knowledge and perspectives. It compels you to be curious and leave your comfort zone. It encourages you to open your mind to new perspectives and experiences. It also asks you to take the road less traveled.', 'The fire sign isn’t concerned with the familiar—it craves newness from every angle. Boredom is the death of Sagittarius. Routines and predictability have no place in this energy.', 'Sagittarius wants you to feel a little confused. It asks you to throw everything you know up in the air and allow the pieces to land where they may. It’s only by shuffling life into disarray that you can connect the dots in new ways, discovering connections you might have missed if you had kept everything tidy.', 'Sagittarius also represents hope. It compels you to take leaps of faith, trusting that the best will unfold. You don’t need to take the familiar road out of fear of the unknown. Sagittarius dares you to take a chance, even if you don’t know the outcome. It teaches you that you can always find the higher meaning in any situation, even those that don’t go according to plan. Sagittarius wants you to walk into unfamiliar territory with the inner confidence that the best-case scenario will occur, even if you have to search for it.', 'This full Moon in Sagittarius is a time to acknowledge where you’re making fear-based decisions. It’s a time to become aware of routines and ruts that you’ve formed to cling to the familiar. It’s also a time to face your fears of the unknown and take leaps of faith that help you grow. Throughout this full Moon, remind yourself that the Universe is always looking out for you and ask yourself how you can shake things up a bit.', 'Fear is an interesting emotion. It serves us well during crucial times but also blocks our growth when it governs all of our decisions. When feeling fear, ask yourself if it’s really warranted. Is there a genuine threat to your well-being or is your fear misplaced? Which fears are essential to keep you safe and which fears are blocking your expansion or preventing you from following your intuition?', 'The full Moon in Sagittarius has the power to help you understand which fears need to stay and which ones should go. It also opens you to believing the best can happen. We spend much of our time “what if-ing” ourselves and envisioning the worst-case scenario. This catastrophic thinking only blocks our ability to manifest and recognize best-case scenarios.', 'Worrying about the future doesn’t help you in any way. It may feel like you’re preparing yourself for different scenarios or controlling these outcomes, but you’re just depleting your energy. The best way to prepare for potentially negative situations is to stay fully present. When you remain present, you have your full energy and attention to respond to anything life hands you.', 'Being present and assuming the best will happen is key to working with the full Moon in Sagittarius. Challenge yourself to remain in this state of mind for at least the day. When intrusive thoughts enter, counter them with affirmations that state the opposite.', 'Creating a positive mindset doesn’t mean ignoring negative feelings or events. Sagittarius teaches us that there is nothing negative or positive on our journeys. There are only lessons.', 'You may come face-to-face with your own shadows during this time. Any internal blocks you’re experiencing become illuminated under this light. The full Moon in Sagittarius acts as your accountability partner by saying, “Remember those things you wanted to change? Today is the day.”', 'It teaches you that life is always handing you wisdom in different forms. You’re continually evolving. Some of these lessons may not be what you consciously want, and they may even leave you with negativity, but ultimately they help you become the person you’re meant to be in this life. Let this Full Moon help you find meaning and knowledge in every event in your life.', 'Of all the signs that oppose one another, Sagittarius and Gemini are the most similar. They each ask us to be curious, widen our perspectives, and connect with others to learn, unlearn, and evolve. When the Sun sits in Gemini and the full Moon sits in Sagittarius, we’re afforded the opportunity to release both Gemini’s and Sagittarius’s lower vibrations and embrace their higher ones.', 'Although you may not be a Gemini or Sagittarius Sun sign or Moon sign, each of us holds these energies and have the opportunity to work with these vibrations on the full Moon. Gemini governs our communication, exchange of information, and connection with the world around us.', 'When we align with the higher vibrations of Gemini, we remain open-minded and curious. We understand that our knowledge is limited and everyone is our teacher. Gemini helps us widen our perspective and consider things from different viewpoints and mindsets. Gemini’s highest vibrations are that of a researcher: inquisitive, nonjudgmental, and open to all possibilities.', 'Gemini’s energy moves quickly and allows us to immediately scan an environment, a project, or even an email for details. When we align with the opportunities Gemini presents, we become fascinated by the world around us, desiring to know everything we can about its mysteries. We become the observer, which in turn makes us less reactive to our emotions.', 'Gemini’s high side allows us to detach from our emotions while remaining present with them. When we’re less reactive to our feelings, they lose the power to control us and become merely information. This nonreactive state allows us to continue learning without closing our minds due to fear, misunderstanding, or anxiety. It also helps us perceive signs in the world around us.', 'Every energy has a low and a high side. Gemini’s low, or shadow, side includes judgment, close-mindedness, and being ungrounded. When we align with this side, our nervous energy takes over and we become fearful of the world around us. Our minds race from one thought to another. We react to our emotions either with anxiety or by numbing ourselves so we feel nothing.', 'In this state, we can’t correctly process our feelings, and they wreak havoc behind the scenes. Suppressed emotions can cause disturbances in sleep, eating, even the ability to digest food and ideas. In an attempt to balance this lower vibratory state of Gemini, we often overanalyze and overthink everything. To control the anxiety, we inundate ourselves and the people around us with questions while we look for answers. We ignore intuition and insist that logic is the only way. We also miss signs and messages that can give us information from the Universe. We disconnect from universal wisdom and inner knowledge.', 'If you find yourself aligning with the lower frequencies of Gemini on this full Moon in Sagittarius, or at any time, ground yourself through your breath and body. Do some yoga to connect with your physical energy and get yourself out of your head. Try to feel your emotions, even if they scare you. Rely on the communication Gemini offers to journal, talk to a friend, or just listen as someone talks to you.', 'Challenge yourself to open your mind and suspend judgment, even if for a moment. Feel your intuition guiding you and trust that all the answers you need in this moment will easily come to you. You don’t need to worry about the future or try to control it. You just need to be open to communicating with yourself and the world around you in the present moment.', 'Sagittarius, much like Gemini, encourages us to explore. This energy inspires us to travel, embrace different cultures, and open our minds to new realities. Sagittarius helps us find the positive, the lessons, and the growth in everything. The high side of Sagittarius is optimistic and full of joy. It sees the world as one integrated whole in which everything is connected. When we align with this higher vibration, we trust that everything will work out how it’s meant, even in the face of adversity.', 'Sagittarius’s high-side energy allows us to see life as a perpetual journey of unraveling truths. There is no endpoint, and we can never exhaust the world’s knowledge. There are always new truths to learn and new perspectives to incorporate into our own understanding. The high side of Sagittarius shows us the infinite potential of our consciousness and encourages us to expand it with every opportunity.', 'In this frequency, we become open to receiving new truths and taking leaps of faith. We trust the journey of life and know that even if we stumble, we’re still learning. Life becomes an evolving experience where there are no failures, no wrong turns, and no mistakes. There are just new realities to encounter that will expand our consciousness to new levels. With each level, we evolve our energy and broaden our connection with the Universe.', 'Sagittarius, in its shadow side, loses faith. When we align with this vibration, we lose trust in ourselves, our paths, and the Universe. We question the meaning of our existence and allow ourselves to fall into a downward spiral of questions that even the greatest philosophers cannot answer.', 'Sagittarius, in its lowest state, causes us to experience an existential crisis, preventing us from moving forward in life. We become stuck in an infinite loop of contemplation. We fail to launch into something new and question the point of everything. We question the meaning of our lives and the meaning of everything that has happened to us. We expect disappointment and take a pessimistic view of our journeys. Fear-based decisions control us and we may even start assuming worst-case scenarios, focusing on the negative. Life begins to feel pointless in this vibration.', 'If you find yourself in this frequency of Sagittarius, take even the smallest step forward into something new. Even if you can’t take a huge leap, find some way to bring different energy into your life. Takee a chance in any direction. Remind yourself of the higher meaning of your life and focus on the positive of a past event, even if it’s challenging to find. Take an expanded look at your life in the context of the cosmos and see the whole point of it all.', 'Another low side of Sagittarius is self-righteousness and judgment. When we align with this side, we assume our experiences have made us more knowledgeable than those around us. We seek to bestow our thoughts and opinions on others, even when unsolicited. We believe that everyone wants to hear our views because our views are the best.', 'This type of energy shuts down our ability to receive new information. It closes our minds and makes us judge anyone who doesn’t agree with us. It can also cause us to judge those who are different, seeing them not as teachers but threats to our understanding of the world.', 'If you find yourself aligning with this side, try on a different viewpoint. If you find yourself feeling judgmental, try to see the world from another perspective. You can also try a judgment detox. Write down all of your judgments, including those of yourself, and notice any patterns. What are your habitual ways of judging? Where do they come from? Next, identify how the way you judge yourself impacts the way you judge others.', 'Know that it’s okay to align with the lower frequencies of these signs. We all have experienced these vibrations to some degree. Notice if you’re judging yourself, and instead practice compassion for yourself. Take the opportunity this full Moon in Sagittarius  to notice any of these patterns in yourself and then shift them. It may feel uncomfortable to step into a new vibration. But know that, over time, the new frequencies you cultivate will eventually feel familiar.', 'The Strawberry Moon in Sagittarius comes with powerful cosmic alignments that influence our experience. These aspects create a unique signature that differentiates this full Moon from others in the same sign.', 'The Sun and Moon square the north node in Pisces during this full Moon in Sagittarius. This creates tension between our present moment awareness—Sun and Moon—and our collective destiny—north node. The north node in Pisces asks us all to embrace compassion, spiritual connection, and intuitive wisdom. The square aspect challenges you to release any rigid thinking that blocks your spiritual evolution. It’s pushing you to trust your intuition more fully, even when your logical mind resists.', 'The opportunity here is massive. When you work consciously with this energy, you can make quantum leaps in your spiritual development. Pay attention to your dreams and intuitive hits during the full Moon in Sagittarius. They contain messages. This aspect also highlights where you might be holding yourself back through overthinking or excessive analysis. The invitation is to drop into your feeling centers rather than staying locked in your head.', 'Saturn and Neptune form a powerful conjunction in Aries. This is one of the most significant astrological aspects of the year! Saturn represents structure, discipline, and life lessons, while Neptune governs dreams, spirituality, and the dissolution of boundaries. These two planets meeting in Aries, the sign of new beginnings and courageous action, asks: How can you turn your spiritual insights into concrete action? How can you bring discipline to your dreams?', 'The conjunction supports you in creating practical systems that help your intuitive guidance manifest in the physical world. You might feel called to establish new routines that honor both your need for structure (Saturn) and your desire for spiritual connection (Neptune). The key is finding the balance between discipline and flow.', 'Also, Jupiter, the planetary ruler of Sagittarius and this full Moon, has just entered Cancer. This placement makes Jupiter particularly influential. Jupiter in Cancer expands our emotional awareness and our connection to home, family, and roots. It brings growth through nurturing and emotional intelligence.', 'Jupiter forms a square aspect with Neptune in Aries during this Strawberry Moon, creating tension between your need for emotional security (Jupiter in Cancer) and your desire for spiritual freedom and new beginnings (Neptune in Aries). This aspect might magnify your emotions while also urging you to break free from emotional patterns that no longer serve you.', 'The opportunity here is to expand your emotional capacity while staying grounded in your truth. You might feel called to take a leap related to your home life or emotional well-being. Trust that Jupiter’s expansive energy is supporting you, even if the way forward feels uncertain.', 'As you work with this full Moon in Sagittarius, remember that these aspects are creating a cosmic environment that supports spiritual growth through practical action. The energy is asking you to trust your intuition, create structure around your spiritual practices, and expand your emotional awareness.', 'Take time to sit with these energies and feel how they’re showing up in your life. Notice where you’re being called to release old patterns and embrace new ways of being. The Sagittarius Strawberry Moon illuminates the path forward, while these aspects provide the cosmic support you need to take the next step on your journey.', 'Full Moons have a reputation for intensity, when everything feels amplified. While this might make you feel exposed and raw, remember there’s a silver lining to this intensity. When your challenges and uncomfortable feelings are amplified, so is your potential. Nothing exists in isolation.', 'The full Moon in Sagittarius brings powerful energy for facing and transforming fears. Fear has a way of living in our bodies. While it’s often at the forefront of our minds, it also subconsciously changes our perceptions and behavior. We hold fear in our physical, energetic, and emotional bodies.', 'Fear always has something to teach us. It brings wisdom and helps us understand ourselves more. It sheds light on blocks and obstacles. Your fear has something to say and wants to be heard. The best thing you can do is listen with an open mind. Once your fears are heard, they become less demanding and more easily moved away as they quiet down, knowing they’ve expressed their concerns.', 'When we embrace fear with an open mind, we can understand it. In that understanding, we take away its power over us. Fear may come, but we don’t have to let it change our course of action or derail our plans. We simply need to listen to it, acknowledge it, and move it out of our bodies. Through facing our fears, we begin to control them as well as our life’s direction.', 'Life doesn’t always have to be perfect—you learn either way. No matter if your experiences are challenging or amazing, they’re all part of the adventure and hold everything you’re here to learn. When you fully align with the opportunity each full Moon brings for change in your life, you can break through limiting barriers and shift your life in any direction you choose.', 'Learn more about the full Moon in Sagittarius, including additional astrological insights and journaling prompts, in the Sagittarius Full Moon workbook, from which the above is excerpted. You can also learn how to release perfectionism and experience clarity, confidence, and calm, one moment at a time, with the Moment app.', 'Ah the hour-long yoga class. It’s quite luxurious, isn’t it? But let’s be frank—some days, it seems impossible to carve out a large chunk of time for your practice. If you ever feel this way (and who hasn’t?) know this: even a few minutes of movement can make a huge difference in how you approach …', 'Join Outside+ to get access to exclusive sequences and other members-only content, and more than 8,000 healthy recipes.']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNDBTVmt5YUZKRE0xcEZkV3BmVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZbGhaRE5zUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Whether you grant yourself the grace to alchemize that discomfort into something wiser, softer, and more solution-oriented, that’s on you, bestie. You got this.', 'On June 11th, 2025 at 11:42 AM EST, the Moon in expansive Sagittarius opposes the Sun in inquisitive Gemini.

You’re breaking up with a former version of yourself, one whose values no longer align with the person you’re becoming. As your soul realigns, you may notice your old values lose their grip.

The Universe’s pressure on your growth may have shown up as disappointment or unmet expectations—but it’s all been leading you toward self-prioritization.

What triggers your feelings may be beyond your control, but how you choose to process them? That’s on you.', 'You’re allowed to play. To create. To be bad at something new and try anyway. No one who truly loves you expects you to be more—or less—than human. And in your case, human means aspirational. This Full Moon invites you to express your values through art. Start with what you already have. Believe in your weird brilliance.

In New York City, it will do so at 8:26 p.m. in the southeastern sky.

We can thank something called a lunar standstill for the deep dip. It occurs in an 18.6-year cycle and affects how high in the sky the moon ends up.', 'More generally, the moon mimics the sun but in opposition.

Moon names typically signify ongoing events at the time they appear in the year.', 'While the strawberry moon’s naming comes from Native American tribes — tied to the time of year the wild fruit ripens — the fact that it runs low in the sky also gives it increased odds of having a pinkish or orange hue.', 'That’s because the light from the moon has to pass through more of Earth’s atmosphere when it is low on the horizon. This impacts how the light is scattered, allowing more reddish hues while minimizing blues.', 'Wildfire smoke, dust from Africa and other similar particulates in the air can magnify the effect when they are present.', 'June is typically an excellent time for moon watching, as nighttime clouds tend to be fewer during summer in most locations, although the hazier conditions of summer can also sometimes linger.', 'In this case, it appears the cloudiest spots will run from the southern Plains of Texas across the northern Gulf Coast and into portions of the Southeast. Additional cloudier zones may include portions of the Rockies and northern Plains.', 'Much of the Lower 48 could be mainly in the clear for sky watching.', 'While clouds are a main determinant of how well the moon can be seen, it also helps to escape city lights, which allows increased views of the night sky.

Bonus: It pays well.', 'CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Be skeptical of advice that benefits the person giving it even if it sounds wise. For instance, the phrase “You have to spend money to make money” is a classic phrase often used by people who want you to “spend” money on them.', 'AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Don’t whisper in a stadium. You have something important to communicate today. Dramatic choices will do the heavy lifting if you let them, so step boldly forward. Take a risk. Be memorable. The world will reward your daring.', 'PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Is it noble to be so sensitive? Maybe. Is it useful? Definitely -- at least in today’s case.
