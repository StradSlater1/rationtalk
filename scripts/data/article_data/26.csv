"S&P 500 Poised for 6,200 as Wave Count Targets Final Stretch of Rally",https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-poised-for-6200-as-wave-count-targets-final-stretch-of-rally-200661684,"['While most were bearish in early April—and many still are—we have provided bullish updates for the S&P 500 (SPX), even though the Elliott Wave roadmap has slightly shifted. This is because we have yet to see five larger waves rise from that March 2020 low. Additionally, we presented a multitude of bullish signals, including the recent Zweig Breadth Thrust, which supported our optimistic stance.', 'Fast forward, and the SPX has gained another 7.6% since our last update. And we believe there’s more gas left in the tank. See Figure 1 below.', 'Figure 1. Our preferred short-term Elliott Wave count for the S&P 500.', 'The price action from the May 23 low supports a (blue) W-i, ii setup, provided it remains above the warning levels: blue (1st warning level for the bulls) at $5870, grey (2nd warning level) at $5841, orange (3rd warning level) at $5805, and red (final warning level) at $5762. Blue W-iii can target $6,125+/25, Blue W-iv $6,000+/-25, and W-v of the then-extended orange W-5 can ideally reach $6,150-6,200. From there, the market can decide whether to add the grey W-iv, v (preferred) or not. For now, we aim to ideally complete the grey W-iii/c, with a subdividing orange W-5 underway.', 'Returning to the shifted EW-based roadmap, and considering that there are still no five larger waves from the March 2020 COVID-19 low (see Figure 2 below), we observe the index at the starting gates of the red W-c of the black W-3: green W-1/a.', 'Figure 2. The SPX weekly chart has our preferred EW count.', 'Why label the current rally as (green) W-1/a? Because the ongoing bull market from the 2020 low can morph into an ending diagonal (ED). In that case, the (black) 3rd wave comprises three waves: red W-a, -b, and -c. And although C-waves often comprise five waves, due to the overarching ED structure we may only get three waves.', 'Namely, the April low was almost a 50% retracement of the October 2022 low to the February 2025 ATH rally. That is more typical B-wave behavior as 4th waves tend to retrace ~38.2%, which is why we were initially looking for the SPX to bottom around the $5,116 level. Moreover, the recent 2+ year rally can be counted as three (green) waves: red W-a.', 'Our ongoing objective analysis of the stock market’s price charts and related indicators has enabled us to clarify their status during these volatile weeks, avoiding bias and subjectivity. Consequently, we continue to sound the bullish horn during these uncertain times for as long as the index stays above its critical levels.', ""With valuations skyrocketing in 2024, many investors are uneasy putting more money into stocks.

', '', 'In the wake of the put buildup on the SPY, the SPY notched four winning sessions out of five. The bullish price action amid the put buildup is a scenario contrarians welcome, as it represents skepticism that could be money waiting to be deployed.', 'Last week’s rally produced another two-week “win” for bulls following the May 19 bullish “outside day” signal. Prior to the latest signal, the historical quantified results were in the bulls’ favor following such a candle as described in the header on the table below. Prior to the May 19 signal, the SPX rallied 86% of the time two weeks later with an average 3% return when positive.', 'The most recent signal helped the win rate for bulls, but the 0.1% return hurt the average win, with the average win now 2.8%, down from 3% prior to the May 19 bull signal.', '', 'Last week’s rally pushed the SPX above its pre-Inauguration close of 5,995 for the first time since closing below this level in late February. Additionally, the index moved above the 6,000-millennium mark, albeit barely, a level that marked a short-term top in mid-November when the SPX touched it for the first time ever. As such, the 5,995-6,000 area could prove to be a short-term challenge, with the SPX trading only about 150 points below its February all-time highs.', 'As a footnote to the significance of 6,000, both call and put open interest at the June 20th expiration SPX 6,000-strike is huge, about 240,000 and 220,000 contracts, respectively. This strike could have a “sticky” effect into June standard expiration, with the SPX not moving too far above or below this strike.', 'The 5,995 pre-Inauguration close and 6,000-millennium mark are in play amid a potentially bearish Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergence, as the SPX moved above its May highs last week but its RSI reading failed to register a higher reading than May.', 'The combination of not being “out of the woods” with respect to resistance in the 5,995-6,000 zone could signal a mild pullback, with the ascending 20-day moving average, currently at 5,900, a first level of potential support.

The recent low in this ratio marked short-term peaks for the SPX on multiple occasions during the past couple of years…, short interest on SPX components continues to build, with the SPX still in a longer-term uptrend.

As mentioned last week, it continues to turn higher from a low level and such action in this ratio has tended to precede weaker market environments, which is a risk to the bull case.', 'But with the increased put buying relative to call buying occurring as the SPX moves higher, the implications signal caution (yellow flag) at this time with the SPX trading in an area of potential resistance but also not experiencing major technical deterioration.  Should the SPX retreat below key support areas, the red flag will be waving as bears exert more control.', 'Not to be lost in the sentiment discussion is the put activity on the SPY that was predominant last week, which we like to see as contrarians if SPY traders are fighting the trend. And the shorts remain active, with short interest at multi-year highs with the SPX only about 2.5% below its all-time high, but trading near the high end of a volatile chop since early December.

The Stock Market Just Did Something for the 7th Time Since 1957. History Says It Signals a Big Move in the S&P 500 in the Next Year.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/01/stock-market-did-signals-big-move-sp-500-next-year/,"['', '', '', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', 'One of Wall Street\'s most famous aphorisms -- ""sell in May and go away"" -- proved patently false this year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.09%) skyrocketed 6.1% last month as investors cheered some good news: Unemployment remained low, and inflation continued to cool despite sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Trade tensions between the United States and China also eased.', 'Historically, the stock market has actually performed reasonably well in May, but the returns were unusually impressive this year. In fact, the S&P 500 has gained more than 5% in May only six other times since it was created in 1957. Interestingly, the index has always moved higher over the next year, often producing double-digit returns. Read on to learn more.', 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', 'As mentioned, the S&P 500 has returned more than 5% in May during seven different years (six, if the current year is excluded) since its inception in 1957. Following those incidents, the index has always increased during the next 12 months, and it notched double-digit gains five out of six times.', 'The chart below lists the years the S&P 500 returned at least 5% in May and how the index performed during the subsequent 12 months.', 'YEAR S&P 500 RETURNED 5%+ IN MAY', ""S&P 500'S FORWARD 12-MONTH RETURN"", '1985', '31%', '1986', '17%', '1990', '8%', '1997', '29%', '2003', '16%', '2009', '19%', 'Average', '20%', 'DATA SOURCE: CARSON GROUP.', 'As shown above, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 20% during the 12-month period after advancing 5% in May. Comparatively, the index has returned an average of 9% for all years since its inception in 1957. That means its performance has been much better than normal following strong results in May.', 'We can apply that information to the current situation to make an educated guess about the next year: The S&P 500 currently trades at 5,912, so the index will climb 20% to 7,086 in the next year if its performance aligns with the historical average.', 'President Donald Trump took office less than five months ago, and already his administration has shaken the status quo in Washington by imposing an aggressive tariff scheme. Currently, the average tax on U.S. imports is 12.1%, the highest level since the early 1940s, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.', 'Investors worry that tariffs will increase inflation and slow economic growth, possibly to the point of recession. Importantly, while the economy has so far remained resilient -- CPI inflation in April dropped to its lowest level since early 2021, and gross domestic product (GDP) is on pace to increase by 3.8% in the second quarter -- that could change as tariffs inevitably curb consumer and business spending.', 'Unfortunately, that puts investors in a somewhat challenging position. On the one hand, it makes sense to be very cautious in the current environment because the stock market is battling tariff-related headwinds not seen in decades. Meanwhile, the president seems to change his trade policies daily, which adds to the uncertainty about the future.', 'On the other hand, investors who stayed on the sidelines in early April, when the president paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, have missed significant gains. The same thing could happen in the coming months as the administration negotiates trade deals.', 'So, the most prudent course of action is to split the difference. Investors should build above-average cash positions in their portfolios so they can capitalize on future drawdowns. But investors should continue to buy high-conviction stocks at a modest pace when they trade at reasonable prices.', 'Trevor Jennewine has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Then, President Trump's tariff discussions put many investors on edge as he announced plans for taxes on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. That went into overdrive at the start of April, when Trump enacted significantly higher-than-expected tariffs on practically every country in the world. The announcement produced one of the worst two-day market crashes in history."", 'But after walking back the implementation of most of the tariffs (for now) and investors acclimating to this uncertain environment, the stock market has mostly recovered.

That said, investors who bought after the 9.2% rally in May of 1990 did have to sit through a three-month period from July through October when stocks fell almost 20%. Ultimately, however, those investors saw the index climb about 8% for the year after the May rally."", ""The month of June is already off to a strong start as of this writing. But if investors can expect 20% gains in the index for the next year, there's still a lot more growth to come."", ""While Detrick's data shows the market tends to keep climbing higher after abnormally strong Mays, investors shouldn't put too much weight into the historical data."", ""First of all, the sample size is minuscule. Six data points over 40 years don't give enough information for the basis of a financial decision."", ""Second of all, every market is different. The 1990 rally was fueled by falling interest rates. Indeed, the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond fell all the way from 9% to 8.6%. By contrast, the 2025 rally was fueled by easing trade tensions. In both cases, many investors expressed concerns about market valuations amid the rally.

The pause comes amid renewed trade tensions sparked by President Donald Trump’s proposal for sweeping tariffs on European Union goods. Initially slated to take effect on June 1, the 50% tariffs have now been postponed until July 9, as negotiators on both sides attempt to draft a compromise trade agreement.', 'This temporary relief, however, hasn’t eliminated market anxiety. The delay in tariffs was overshadowed by fresh concerns about potential levies on iPhones assembled overseas and new restrictions on semiconductor equipment exports to China. These developments have unsettled risk assets, especially tech stocks, which had previously led the charge higher.', 'Despite early weakness during Monday’s U.S. trading session, E-mini S&P 500 Index Futures staged a solid recovery, closing at 5,936 points. The intraday turnaround suggests underlying strength in risk appetite, even if momentum has moderated. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended in positive territory, reflecting a broader but tentative confidence across asset classes.', 'Cryptocurrencies, often treated as a barometer of global risk sentiment, surged in tandem, riding the wave of optimism fueled by expectations of further diplomatic progress and softened trade posturing.', 'June has historically been a tepid month for U.S. equities, and this week’s start reflects that seasonal caution. This slowdown follows the S&P 500’s strongest May in 35 years, during which it climbed nearly 10%. That rally was supported by strong earnings, tech-fueled tech enthusiasm, and improving U.S. growth data.', 'Nonetheless, a notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirming an extension of tariff exemptions under Section 301 until August 31 has offered a timely reprieve for markets. Additionally, the White House has hinted at a potential call between President Trump and China’s Xi Jinping later this week—an event that could ease market nerves or introduce fresh volatility, depending on tone and substance.', 'Beyond the economic sphere, geopolitical developments are also shaping risk sentiment. Russia and Ukraine concluded another round of negotiations in Istanbul, which reportedly inched the two adversaries closer to a framework for ending the war. A new prisoner exchange agreement is in the works, signaling incremental progress that markets are quietly welcoming.', 'The S&P 500’s path forward depends largely on how tariff developments unfold in the coming weeks and whether new geopolitical flare-ups disrupt the delicate investor optimism. If the current calm holds and no new tariffs are implemented, markets appear primed for a breakout above the 6,000 mark. Still, in an environment defined by headline sensitivity and fragile global diplomacy, volatility remains a near certainty.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNTNhM0ZSV1hkMlFXVkZhMmR2VFJDc0FoallCQ2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
