', 'Ever since President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff in April on all imported passenger vehicles, car experts have been concerned that the cost of new vehicles across the industry would take a massive hit. ', 'In May, the administration imposed a separate 25% tariff on auto parts such as engines, transmissions, power-train parts and electrical components.

Consumers who rushed to buy tariff-free vehicles helped fuel a sales boom this spring, but dealers now face constrained supply, especially on affordable models, and are paying more for trade-ins to restock their lots.', 'According to Cars.com data, the average new car price rose to $49,530 in April, up 0.8% year-over-year, as dealers began to run out of tariff-free stock. Automakers have already begun raising prices, particularly on vehicles manufactured in countries hit the hardest by the new import duties. For instance, Mexican-built models saw a $1,102 month-over-month price increase, and Canadian imports rose $267.

New-car inventory rose only 3.7% year over year in April, while available stock on dealer lots declined by 5.2% from the start of April to May.', 'Due to a limited number of new cars available, especially in the sub-$30,000 price range, many shoppers are now turning to the used car market. However, this segment is also facing challenges because of reduced production during the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant decline in lease returns.

That’s why shoppers rushed to purchase new cars when they saw tariffs looming, but what happens when that supply of pre-tariff new vehicles runs out? That’s a problem dealerships are hoping to solve in part with additional used inventory. If you have a good trade-in, dealerships are willing to pay more for it to pad out their offerings.', 'Related: Affordable Cars Under $30,000 Face the Biggest Threat From Trump’s Tariffs', 'Some automakers are already raising prices as a result of higher import costs, and consumers who may get priced out of the new vehicle they want but still need a car have to go somewhere. That somewhere is often the used side of the lot, and Cars.com’s latest data analysis shows exactly how these shifts are looking for consumers.', 'The supply of new cars to dealership lots has slowed down even as demand has been spiking, with many automakers still in “wait and see” mode over what tariffs on their supply chains and finished inventories will end up looking like. Some have even paused shipments from more heavily tariffed countries. As a result, new-car inventory grew just 3.7% year over year in April. This follows a booming period of double-digit increases in new-car inventory that lasted from September 2022 through January 2025. On the lots, it’s even grimmer, as dealers started May with 5.2% less inventory than they did at the beginning of April.', 'Meanwhile, demand for new cars continues to be strong, as consumers have been biting on those sweet, sweet tariff-free cars sitting on dealer lots. The rush to buy a car before tariffs started affecting pricing drove much higher sales of 17.8 million and 17.3 million in March and April, respectively. To put that in perspective, that includes the sixth highest number of March car sales in nearly 50 years, and we haven’t seen two consecutive months with over 17 million in sales since the post-COVID vaccine rush in 2021.', 'We’re already starting to see sales drop off a little as tariffs went into effect on automobiles and their key components, but that combination of booming sales, tariffs increasing production costs and less inventory making it onto dealers’ lots to meet demand sets up the perfect storm for higher new-car prices.', 'New-car prices have remained mostly steady for the past 19 months, with the average new-car price on Cars.com hovering around $50,000. Unfortunately for budget-conscious consumers, that average is expected to keep rising in the near future. The average new-car price creeped up for the second month in a row, rising 0.8% year over year in April to $49,530. Consumers looking to get ahead of tariffs flocked to affordable options in particular, drying up pre-tariff inventory of less expensive cars.', 'With many new cars under $30,000 relying heavily on less expensive labor in other countries to meet that price point, they’re particularly vulnerable to tariffs increasing their prices. Mexican-built vehicles are the most affordable ones on sale with an average price on Cars.com of roughly $42,000 in April, but that average reflects an increase of $1,100 from March. That trend continued into the first week of May, with Canadian import prices on Cars.com increasing by $267 month over month and Mexican imports shooting up $1,102.', 'One of the most significant casualties of the tariffs was the last new car available for under $20,000 (including both MSRP and destination fees): the base manual-transmission Nissan Versa. According to Nissan, it didn’t make sense to keep producing this variant of the ultra-low-cost Versa for the U.S. market due to low demand and increased import costs. Still, this feels like a grim sign all around, and not just for the fact that you need at least $20,000 to get a new car now. An automaker discontinuing its most affordable car at a time when everything is getting more expensive for consumers is a sign of tough times ahead.', 'On top of that, as tariffs stick around, some of the incentives that helped drive sales over the past few months are already being pulled back or discontinued, with more companies expected to follow suit as pre-tariff inventory gets exhausted.', 'Higher new-car prices push shoppers to consider used cars, and unfortunately, that’s a section of the lot that’s still struggling to recover from curtailed production during the pandemic. In fact, 2025 is expected to be the worst year for used-car inventory as a result of the smaller number of late-model vehicles that were leased and sold during the pandemic. Lease returns in particular are minuscule compared to pre-pandemic years, and as a result, used cars have been trending higher-mileage and older in recent years.', 'If you have a car to trade in, dealerships want it. Listings under $10,000 have grown sharply on Cars.com, but with a higher average of 135,000 miles, they aren’t as appealing to consumers and tend to sit on the lots longer as a result. The fastest-selling segment of used cars are those priced between $20,000 and $29,000, with many late-year, low-mile examples falling here. Prices are rising, though, as consumers consider used cars as alternatives to more expensive new ones and dealerships are paying more for trade-ins to help pad out their inventory.', 'How much more? Trade-in values rose by $820 year over year in April, which is the first time values rose in the month of April since the recent high-point for inflation in 2022. Trade-in values also had a month-over-month increase of $388 from March to April — the highest they’ve been since May 2023.', 'Unfortunately, higher trade-in values means used-car prices are likely to go up soon, so if you’re looking to buy one, start shopping now. If you have a trade-in that’s in good shape, though, it’s worth considering how much you can use that trade-in to lower what you’ll pay for its replacement.', 'More From Cars.com:', 'Don’t bank on lower interest rates or lease incentives to help you afford a new or new-to-you car. While the Fed did lower its rates by 1% in late 2024, it takes a while for that to be reflected in consumer lending rates.

A confluence of tightening inventory, older trade-ins and looming tariffs on new vehicles has put a renewed strain on used vehicle pricing, according to recent data from automotive publisher Edmunds.', 'The first quarter of 2025 began with encouraging signs. New-car inventory had largely recovered from the semiconductor shortages that plagued the early 2020s, and average transaction prices (ATPs) for new cars plateaued as manufacturers began reintroducing modest incentives.', 'However, the used market tells a different story. A dramatic slowdown in leasing during 2022 and 2023, compounded by fewer overall vehicle sales, has led to a sharp decline in the number of near-new vehicles entering the used market. The average age of trade-ins climbed to 7.6 years in the first quarter of 2025, the oldest since 2019, reflecting the diminishing supply of newer used vehicles. This scarcity is already impacting pricing trends.', 'For the first time since mid-2023, the average price of a 3-year-old used car surged past $30,000, hitting $30,522, a 2.3% increase from the same period last year. Alongside higher prices, used vehicles sat on dealer lots for an average of 38 days before sale, four days longer than a year ago and the longest turn rate since early 2021.', 'Dealers are adapting to the low-supply environment by holding out for higher offers, particularly on near-new models. As a result, the average age of used vehicles listed online jumped from 5.7 years in March 2024 to 6.1 years in March 2025.', ""A once wide price chasm between new and near-new vehicles is narrowing. The gap between ATPs for new and 3-year-old vehicles fell to $16,970 in the first quarter of 2025,  the first time it's dipped below $17,000 since late 2022. Edmunds said this subtle yet significant shift hints at deeper price volatility to come, especially if new car supplies are again constrained, this time by tariffs."", 'Much like the global chip shortage redefined resale value projections in 2022, 2025 may see similar disruptions — but this time, fueled by geopolitical policies. Emerging tariffs on foreign-built vehicles are beginning to shape both the new and used markets unevenly. Vehicles originally manufactured in countries like Canada and Japan are seeing resale values significantly outperform initial predictions.', 'For instance, U.S.-built vehicles had a predicted resale value of $26,719 for 3-year-old models, but actual resale prices have climbed to $33,572, a $6,853 difference. Canadian-built models saw an even larger variance of $7,760.

Just looking at the mechanical end of it. In which case, you have to get it up in the air and look,” Marone said.', 'He concluded that he’d advise buying the used car he inspected for News10 NBC. “This looks like a great car.

The seasonal adjustment slightly lowered the decline seen in the month, as non-seasonally adjusted values fell more than usual following the strong increase in April related to the tariff announcement. The non-adjusted price in May decreased by 1.5% compared to April, resulting in an unadjusted average price that was 4% higher year over year.', '', '“Wholesale appreciation trends were remarkably strong in April, but the market gave some of that strength back in May, though values remain well above last year’s levels,” said Jeremy Robb, senior director of Economic and Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. “Weekly wholesale depreciation trends were stronger than usual in the middle of the month but slowed down in the last week of May, with values aligning with the long-term run rates. The used retail days’ supply remains down 5% compared to last year’s levels, which is seasonally tighter than normal, as wholesale days’ supply at Manheim is also currently down 5%. While the market continues to digest the impact of tariffs, we could see a bit higher levels of wholesale depreciation over the summer. However, lower inventory levels may counterbalance those more aggressive depreciation trends in the coming months.”', 'In May, Manheim Market Report (MMR) values experienced price declines for each week of the month, with the lowest declines occurring in the last week.

According to new data from Edmunds, the average transaction price for a 3-year-old used vehicle rose to $30,522 in Q1 2025 — a 2.3% increase from the previous year and the first time this figure has exceeded $30,000 since Q2 2023.', 'The rising prices are accompanied by longer lot times, with used vehicles now spending an average of 38 days on dealer lots, up from 34 days in Q1 2024 and the highest level recorded since early 2021.', 'The longer lot times paired with higher average transaction prices show dealers are likely maintaining higher asking prices and demonstrating a willingness to wait for the right buyers given the lower supply.', 'The tightening supply of near-new vehicles stems largely from a sharp drop in leasing activity during 2022 and 2023, reducing the number of lightly used vehicles returning to the market. Edmunds reported the average age of trade-ins reached 7.6 years in Q1 2025 — the oldest on record since Q1 2019.', 'In parallel, the pricing gap between new and used vehicles is narrowing. The difference between the average transaction prices for new and 3-year-old used vehicles dipped to $16,970, the smallest spread since Q3 2022. This erosion signals a return of pricing pressure in the used market, especially with tariffs on new cars threatening to exacerbate new vehicle shortages.', 'Edmunds cautioned that resale value projections may become more volatile. “The 2020s in particular have proven just how impactful external influences can be on upending predicted resale values,” the release noted. As tariffs take effect unevenly across countries, trade-in values may rise unexpectedly for certain models, particularly those built overseas or in smaller volumes.', '“For shoppers with trade-ins, country of assembly — usually a nonfactor — now plays an unexpected and potentially significant factor in a vehicle’s resale value,” Edmunds said, encouraging consumers to seek multiple trade-in offers.', 'For dealers, the scarcity of new vehicles may increase reliance on used inventory to maintain sales volume and support certified pre-owned programs. Edmunds recommended reevaluating inventory sourcing strategies to manage through anticipated market turbulence.', 'While not as universal as the COVID-era chip shortage, targeted tariffs could introduce similarly disruptive dynamics, reshaping supply and pricing patterns in both the new and used vehicle segments.', 'READ NOW', 'Autobody News is a free monthly publication for the owners and managers of 36,000+ collision repair shops across the country.\nClick on the regional area of your choice or subscribe here.', 'Regional and national collision repair news your shop needs!', 'Copyright © 2025 Autobody News. is a publication of Autobody News, LLC Copyrights.

Tariff Uncertainty Is Already Shaking Up Car Buying Decisions,https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/edmunds-data-auto-tariffs-already-affecting-car-buying-decisions.html,"['', 'President Trump’s renewed push for tariffs in his second term has ignited uncertainty across the auto industry, bringing fresh challenges just as the market was finding its footing after years of pandemic-driven volatility. Recent court rulings have made it harder for consumers and industry players alike to interpret what’s unfolding and what the consequences mean for their wallets. ', ""So far, though, the actual impact of tariffs on the automotive market has been more muted than many expected. According to Edmunds data, key indicators like average transaction prices (ATPs) for new vehicles have largely stayed in line with seasonal norms: In April 2025, the ATP for new vehicles was $48,422, up 2.2% from April 2024's $47,385 and up 2.7% from March 2025's $47,148. While there have been some targeted moves — such as automakers adjusting suggested retail pricing on select models or limiting availability of certain vehicles — these actions haven’t yet translated into widespread disruptions."", ""While the numbers haven't moved significantly, car shoppers are already signaling that they’re preparing for change. If tariffs remain in place, broader market disruption may follow. "", ""In a recent Edmunds survey of in-market shoppers,1 44% said tariffs will definitely influence their purchase decision, and another 31% said tariffs will somewhat factor in. Just 17% said tariffs wouldn't impact their decision at all."", 'Beyond actual price changes, the perception of what might happen appears to be influencing behavior. Edmunds data shows that buying activity in March and early April was elevated relative to expectations, which suggests that some shoppers were motivated to accelerate their car-buying timeline in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes. Broader market indicators like the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) also showed a seasonal lift during this period. This kind of ""pull-ahead"" behavior isn’t unusual when consumers feel a shift is coming — even if that shift hasn’t fully materialized yet.', ""Many shoppers believe they have a good understanding of how tariffs will affect the market. According to Edmunds' survey data, 55% said they're somewhat or very confident in their understanding of how tariffs affect vehicle prices. Only 21% said they weren’t confident. Whether or not that confidence is well placed, this level of awareness could make consumer response even more turbulent in the weeks ahead."", ""One of the most immediate ways tariffs appear to be influencing consumer behavior is in purchase timing, which is particularly tricky right now given the uncertainty around how long these tariffs might last. The volatility of the situation is likely making it difficult for shoppers to know whether to act quickly or hold off. According to Edmunds' survey data, 37% of in-market shoppers say they plan to buy sooner because of tariffs, while 25% say they’re choosing to delay their purchase."", ""Edmunds' survey results show that shoppers are already reevaluating their options in light of tariff concerns: 58% of respondents said they’re more interested in used vehicles, and 46% of those said they're more inclined to consider certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles specifically."", 'Edmunds data shows there is a growing perception among shoppers that used vehicles could be less affected by tariffs, especially in a market where new vehicle prices have already climbed 29% since March 2019, even before tariff-related effects have fully taken hold. ', 'That sentiment appears to be surfacing in real car shopper behavior: Edmunds site data reveals a measurable uptick in new-car shoppers also browsing used inventory.', 'Shoppers’ movement into the used market isn’t unexpected, but it will likely add pressure to an already constrained environment. Increased demand will likely drive prices higher, creating a challenging market for both consumers and dealers. Compounding the issue is the limited availability of near-new used inventory, a lingering consequence of historically low leasing volumes during the height of the microchip shortage three years ago.', 'That shortage is now catching up to the used market, creating a tough situation for dealers who need more used vehicles to meet rising demand and for consumers who may now be priced out of both new and newer-used options. The used market may offer some relief from new-vehicle pricing pressures, but prices can still fluctuate due to current market disruptions. ', 'Buying a car is often a high-stakes financial decision, and for some shoppers, the added uncertainty around tariffs can introduce new stress. From the pressure to act quickly to the fear of paying more later, this environment could shift the emotional tone of the car-buying process. The typical sense of excitement may now be clouded by second-guessing and financial anxiety.', ""And it's not just shoppers who are likely to feel the impact — automakers and dealers are also navigating uncharted territory. Forecasting demand is likely becoming far more challenging when buying patterns are this disrupted. With so many consumers rethinking their timelines, traditional models built around seasonality and historical trends could start to lose their predictive power as well as the adjustments that will need to be made — or not made — to the vehicles themselves. "", ' 1Edmunds’ data for this report is based on a consumer sentiment survey conducted in May 2025 among car shoppers who have purchased a vehicle previously and have indicated they are planning on purchasing a vehicle in the next six months. N=500.', 'Tariff-related shifts go beyond pricing: They may be changing the psychology of the car-buying process in real time. And as legal challenges continue to test the boundaries of U.S. trade policy, consumers and dealers alike must stay agile in an environment where uncertainty could outlast the tariffs themselves. For automakers, the pressure runs even deeper: Those with the broadest global footprint and most efficient cost structures will likely be the best positioned to withstand the volatility of shifting policies, pricing dynamics and consumer demand.
