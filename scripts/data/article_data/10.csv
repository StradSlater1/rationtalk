Russia Executes Revenge Strikes Against Ukraine For Blowing Up Its Bombers,https://www.twz.com/news-features/russia-executes-revenge-strikes-against-ukraine-for-blowing-up-its-bombers,"['HOWARD ALTMAN', 'PUBLISHED JUN 6, 2025 1:23 PM EDT', 'VIA X', 'The TWZ Newsletter', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'Terms of Service and Privacy Policy', 'In one of the war’s largest cross-border exchanges, Ukrainian forces hit airfields, fuel depots and other military targets while Russia launched hundreds of drones and scores of missiles at cities across Ukraine that killed at least three and wounded dozens. The bombardment came just days after Ukraine launched a wide-scale, successful attack on long-range military aviation assets from within Russia. You can read more about that in our coverage here.', 'Ukraine launched “a preemptive strike” on several Russian military targets ahead of a looming Russian attack, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff claimed on Facebook. “On the eve of the massive enemy shelling, enemy airfields and other important military facilities were hit.” Russia said its barrage was retaliation for the destruction of its bombers.', 'A “successful strike was carried out on the Engels airfield in the Saratov region – a place of concentration of enemy aircraft remaining after the operation of the Security Service of Ukraine,” the General Staff added. “The Diaghilev airfield in the Ryazan region, where air tankers and escort fighters are based, which are used to provide missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, was also hit.”', '', 'In addition, “the Defense Forces of Ukraine attacked a number of important enemy facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine. In particular, the defeat of the logistics point of the 30th motorized rifle regiment of the 72nd motorized rifle division of the Russian Army near the settlement of Kulbaky, Kursk region, was recorded. The results of the defeat are being clarified. Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the complete cessation of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.”', 'The Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) downplayed the attacks, saying its “alerted air defense systems intercepted and destroyed 174 Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles over Bryansk, Rostov, Saratov, Voronezh, Kaluga, Kursk, Oryol, Ryazan, Tula, Belgorod, Tambov, and Moscow regions, and the Republic of Crimea.”', 'The MoD also claimed that “three Ukrainian Neptune-MD guided missiles were also destroyed over the Black Sea by air defense systems.”', 'The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims.', 'Videos and images emerged on social media showing the fuel depot at Engels, about 400 miles from the border, being struck and fully engulfed in flames.', '', '', '', 'The attack on Dyagilevo, about 300 miles from the border, was also captured on video.', '', 'The extent of the destruction at either facility is as yet unclear, though clearly the raging fires at Engels have caused significant damage. Saratov Gov. Roman Busargin acknowledged an attack, but downplayed the damage.', '“As a result of the UAV attack, there is a fire at one of the industrial enterprises in Engels,” he claimed on Telegram. “There are no preliminary casualties. All relevant services are working on the scene. Specialists are taking all necessary measures to eliminate the consequences.”', 'Satellite images we obtained of Dyagilevo appear to show little to no damage to the airfield operating area.', 'A closer view shows a Tu-95MS Bear-H long-range turboprop bomber and two Il-76 Candid transport aircraft, covered in tires, parked at Dyagilevo. A decoy outline of a Candid can also be seen.', 'Dyagilevo and Engels have been frequent targets for Ukraine. The former was attacked on June 1 during Ukraine’s audacious Operation Spiderweb that saw several Russian bombers and other aircraft destroyed or damaged by drones launched from trucks by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). While a high-resolution satellite image of Dyagilevo from Planet Labs, taken on June 2 and reviewed by TWZ, showed no obvious signs of damage to any aircraft there, some may have been hit by shrapnel, against which relatively thin-skinned aircraft are notably vulnerable, and this would not necessarily be visible even in higher-resolution imagery. You can see one image taken in the aftermath of Operation Spider Web below.', '', 'Engels was attacked three times in the month of December 2022 alone. On at least one of those occasions, the Russian Ministry of Defense said the air base was attacked by Soviet-made jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles modified by Ukraine to carry explosives. Those attacks — which also targeted Dyagilevo Air Base — resulted in damage to at least one Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bomber and apparently also to a Tu-95MS.', 'More recently, in March, ammunition and weapons storage bunkers at Engels were destroyed in a Ukrainian drone attack there. The attack resulted in a massive fireball and mushroom cloud. You can read our initial story about it here. In January of this year, we reported on a huge fire close to Engels Air Base, caused by what Russian officials described as a “massive” Ukrainian drone attack. The strike was on the strategically important fuel storage tank farm for Engels and the fire raged for several days after, as seen in the image in the embedded tweet below:', '', 'In addition to those bases, two Russian helicopters were struck by Ukrainian drones at the Bryansk International Airport, according to the ASTRA news outlet. That airport is located about 75 miles from the border.', '“According to ASTRA sources in the Russian Emergencies Ministry, as a result of the hits, an Mi-8 combat helicopter completely burned down, and its combat kit detonated,” ASTRA claimed on Telegram. “An Mi-35 helicopter was also partially damaged. In addition, the airport’s administrative building and the rescue service building were damaged. Several dozen employees were evacuated from the Ozon warehouse, not far from which the airport is located. There were no casualties.”', 'Video and images from the scene showed a massive explosion creating a large fireball at the airport.', '', '', '', '', 'Ukraine also reportedly attacked Tambov Oblast, about 250 miles northeast of the border.', 'The Supernova+ Telegram channel shared footage from Michurinsk in Tambov Oblast and claimed that drones struck the Progress plant there, which manufactures equipment for aircraft and missile control systems, as well as for gas and oil pipeline infrastructure. The Exilenova Telegram channel stated that the strike hit the central workshop, leading to a roof collapse. Images showed fire damage and signs of electronic warfare systems operating at the time of the strike.', '', 'Moscow’s mayor claimed that nine Ukrainian drones were shot down over his city, according to ASTRA.', '', 'There were also claims that Ukrainian forces hit a tower once used to extract gas from the Black Sea. ', '“A new mark of fires at sea has appeared on one of the platforms in the Karkinitsky Gulf near Crimea,” the Crimean Wind monitoring group claimed on Telegram, citing NASA fire data. “Our source reported a battle at sea last night. Let us recall that Russia is placing radar stations, signal repeaters for drones, and reconnaissance equipment on gas production platforms.”', 'A Neva radar system, storage facilities and a residential module on the tower were destroyed in an attack on May 19, according to Crimean Wind.', '', 'Though Ukraine said it carried out attacks designed to blunt a looming Russian attack, Russia was able to hit several regions last night. The Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) claimed the bombardment was retaliation for Operation Spiderweb.', '“Last night, in response to the terrorist actions of the Kyiv regime, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation carried out a massive strike with long-range air, sea, and ground-based high-precision weapons, as well as with strike UAVs against design bureaus, enterprises producing and repairing weapons and military hardware of Ukraine, attack drone assembly workshops, flight training centres, and AFU weapons and military hardware depots,” the MoD claimed. “The aim of the strike has been achieved. All the assigned targets have been engaged.”', 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russia struck civilian targets and that at least three people died and dozens were injured in a barrage across the country. Later claims put the death toll at four.', '“Russia doesn`t change its stripes – another massive strike on cities and ordinary life,” he stated on X. “They targeted almost all of Ukraine – Volyn, Lviv, Ternopil, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy, and Chernihiv regions. Some of the missiles and drones were shot down. I thank our warriors for their defense. But unfortunately, not all were intercepted. In total, over 400 drones and more than 40 missiles – including ballistic missiles – were used in today’s attack.”', '', 'In Kyiv, three members of the State Emergency Service in Ukraine were killed coming to the rescue of those injured during that attack, officials in Kyiv stated.', 'Videos of the destruction across Ukraine emerged on social media.', '', 'Lutsk, in western Ukraine, was one of those cities hit. The following video shows four Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles striking buildings there.', '', 'Another video shows those missiles emitting flares or chaff before striking, a tactic to confuse air defenses. At least five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to Mayor Ihor Polishchuk.', '', 'The Ukrainian Track and Field Team came under fire in Lutsk.', '', 'Ternopil’s military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday’s strike was the “most massive air attack on our region to date,” BBC reported.', 'The Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack while homes, schools and a government facility had been damaged.', '', 'The city of Chernihiv was hit by Russian Geran-2 drones as well as cruise and ballistic missiles, according to Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, spokesman for the Kherson Regional Military Administration of Ukraine.', '“A residential area came under fire: multi-story buildings, private homes, a kindergarten, a local business, infrastructure facilities, and civilians’ vehicles were damaged,” he said. “Due to the strikes on the energy infrastructure, around 40.000 consumers remain without electricity. As of now, four civilians have been reported injured. Three of them received assistance on site, while another man was hospitalized in moderate condition.”', 'Though Russia lost several Tu-95s during Operation Spiderweb, it still managed to use some in this latest onslaught. Russia fired 36 Kh-101 cruise missiles from Bears and Tu-160 Blackjack long-range supersonic bombers from the airspace of the Saratov region, over the Caspian Sea, according to the Ukrainian Air Force (UaAF). In addition, the UaAF said six Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles were launched from Kursk and Voronezh regions, one Kh-31P anti-radar missile was fired from a tactical aircraft over the Black Sea and two Iskander-K cruise missiles were launched from the Dzhankoy district of Crimea.', 'The extent of Russia’s response to Operation Spiderweb is still unknown, however, these attacks show that both sides seem to be locked into an escalation of cross-border bombardment.', 'Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com', ""The commander of Azov's Unmanned Systems Battalion shares the latest details about how tactics are evolving in the bloody Donbas region."", 'Some of the bombers were armed with cruise missiles when Ukraine’s drones rained down on them.', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN, TYLER ROGOWAY', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN, TYLER ROGOWAY', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By Signing Up You Agree To Our Terms Of Service And Privacy Policy.', '© 2024 Recurrent Ventures.

Four people were killed, including three emergency workers in Kyiv.', 'The Ukrainian president wrote in a social media post: “If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively.”', 'Missiles and drones hammered the Ukrainian capital leading fires to rage through residential buildings and forcing the local metro system to close after a train was hit.', 'It was part of a nationwide assault that ranks among the largest coordinated attacks in the three years of full-scale war, with 44 ballistic and cruise missiles and 407 drones launched. About 50 people were injured across the country.', 'Yurii Ihnat, the Ukrainian air force spokesperson, said Ukrainian forces had shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones.', 'Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had carried out the overnight attacks in response to what it called Ukrainian “terrorist acts” against Russia. The Kremlin later described its three-year invasion of Ukraine as “existential” for Russia, casting it as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia.', '“For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters, responding to remarks by Trump on Thursday comparing Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children.', 'Despite the efforts of Ukraine’s air defences, the authorities in Kyiv reported that three emergency workers had been killed and 20 people wounded, of whom 16 had been hospitalised. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing at several locations,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram.', 'According to the ministry of internal affairs, the three victims were firefighters from the state emergency service who died while responding to the attack. “They were working under fire to help people,” the ministry said in a statement.', 'Operation of the city’s metro transport system was disrupted after a Russian strike damaged a train travelling between stations, the city’s military administration said. The air attack also triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of Kyiv, authorities said.', 'A residential block in the Solomianskyi district took severe damage to the upper floors with entire windows, balcony frames, and parts of an outer wall blown away. More than 2,000 households in Kyiv’s eastern bank remained without electricity on Friday morning.', 'Russia had previously vowed to take revenge on Ukraine after Monday’s audacious drone attack, known as Operation Spiderweb, on its bomber fleet.', 'Initially, two TU-95MC and two TU-160MC bombers were deployed by Russia on Thursday night. This was a lower number than had been feared and may have been the result of the Kremlin’s resources being reduced by the events of 1 June. Kalibr missiles were also fired from Russian warships stationed in the Black Sea.', 'Putin informed the US president, Donald Trump, in a call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the operation that Ukraine has claimed damaged or destroyed 41 aircraft. “They went deep into Russia and [Putin] actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it’s probably not going to be pretty,” Trump had told reporters.', 'Trump said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” rather than pursue peace immediately. Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Istanbul on Monday with no headway to a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.', 'The barrage on Kyiv had begun with the buzz of Russian kamikaze drones followed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire.

He said Moscow’s attack injured 80 and targeted “almost all” of Ukraine, listing nine regions, from Lviv in the west to Sumy in the northeast.', 'Although Russia has pummeled Ukraine almost daily over three years of full-scale war, Ukrainians had been bracing for retaliation since Sunday, when Kyiv launched an audacious operation that struck more than a third of Russia’s strategic cruise missile carriers.', 'In a call with his US counterpart Donald Trump on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow would have to respond to Kyiv’s assault.', 'Russia’s Ministry of Defense said its strikes were in response to what it called Kyiv’s “terrorist acts.” It was not immediately clear if the attack was the extent of Russia’s pledged retaliation, or if Putin intends to escalate further. After the embarrassment of Kyiv’s operation, there was a chorus of bellicose calls from pro-Kremlin pundits for a severe – potentially nuclear – response.', 'Although Ukrainians had been buoyed last weekend by the news of Kyiv’s successful operation, many were wary of how Russia might strike back. But after Friday’s strikes, Kyiv residents told CNN they supported Ukraine’s strikes against the aircraft Moscow has used to bomb Ukraine for more than three years.', '“It didn’t break us at all. The morale is as high as it was.

Of those 452 projectiles, the air force said it had downed 406, including 32 of the cruise missiles and four of the ballistic missiles. The other two ballistic missiles did not reach their targets, it added.', 'The strikes also hit Chernihiv, near the border with Belarus, which was rocked by 14 explosions from drones and ballistic missiles, including cruise missiles and Iskander-M missiles, local officials said. Five others were wounded in strikes in the northwestern city of Lutsk, near the border with Poland. Footage geolocated by CNN showed at least four missiles slamming into the city, kicking up fiery explosions on impact.', 'The Russian Ministry of Defense said it had also intercepted and destroyed 174 Ukrainian drones from Thursday evening to early Friday morning and had destroyed three Ukrainian Neptune-MD guided missiles over the Black Sea.', 'All week, Ukrainians have been bracing for Russia’s retaliation to last weekend’s drone attack, which struck 34% of Moscow’s nuclear-capable bombers stationed at airfields as far away as Siberia.', 'On Tuesday, Ukraine also launched an attack on the Kerch Bridge, the only direct connection point between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula, with 1,100 kilograms of explosives that had been planted underwater.', 'After Trump’s call with Putin on Wednesday, the US president said that his Russian counterpart had told him that Moscow would have to respond to Ukraine’s assaults. Trump’s account of the call gave no indication that he had urged Putin to temper his response, to the dismay of many in Ukraine.', '“When Putin mentioned he is going to avenge or deliver a new strike against Ukraine, we know what it means. It’s about civilians,” Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko told CNN earlier this week. “And President Trump didn’t say, ‘Vladimir, stop.’”', 'Despite Trump’s support for recent peace talks in Istanbul between Ukraine and Russia, on Thursday he signaled that he may be adopting a more hands-off approach, likening the war to a brawl between children.', '“Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy,” Trump said in the Oval Office, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz looking on silently. “They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled. Sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Russia Conducts Largest Air Attack on Ukraine to Date,https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia-conducts-largest-air-attack-ukraine-date,"['Photo: Vladyslav Kravets/Suspilne Ukraine/JSC ""UA:PBC""/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images', 'Critical Questions by Yasir Atalan and Benjamin Jensen', 'Published May 29, 2025', 'Russia recently conducted its largest air attack on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and other regions in the country and killing over 15 people and injuring dozens. The attacks, which occurred over the weekend of May 25 during stalled negotiations, were an order of magnitude higher and more deadly than previous salvos. Russia launched a record number of Shahed drones, with 355 deployed on May 25 alone. Alongside these low-cost, long-range loitering munitions, there was a significant increase in the number of Iskander ballistic missiles fired at Ukraine. Typically averaging 1–2 launches per week, 23 were reportedly fired over just two days, accompanied by more than 60 reported air-launched cruise missiles, including models like the X-101 and X-555. In total, approximately 1,000 drones and missiles were launched during this roughly three-day period, demonstrating the use of air and missile power to coerce Ukraine.', 'This massive attack occurred during the prisoner swap deal and an increased push for peace talks between the warring parties. This intensive campaign shows that Russia’s stockpiling of missiles and drones is increasing. In fact, the Ukrainian government estimates that Russia has a stockpile of 500 ballistic missiles, which could be used in future salvos. Moreover, Moscow appears to be adapting its tactics. There were reports that the Iskanders used new radar decoys to defeat Patriot interceptors. The Shaheds also adopted new attack profiles, including using higher altitude attack vectors and more decoys. Last, Russia appears to be using new approaches to targeting, such as using Telegram to hire local Ukrainians to mark targets.', 'Q1: What does Russia’s record Shahed deployment signal about its evolving air attack strategy?', 'A1: The record number of Shahed drones signals Russia’s concept of coercive airpower:', 'overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and attack civilian targets and infrastructure to compel Kyiv to end the war. This approach also serves to wear down civilian morale and depletes resources by maintaining relentless pressure. By combining these low-cost drones with more sophisticated ballistic and cruise missiles, Russia is finding new ways to wear down Ukrainian air defenses faster than domestic or Western supporters can replenish them, thus compounding the political pressure each salvo generates.', 'Additionally, the attacks demonstrate Russia’s successful campaign to scale up of domestic production of these drones and decoy systems. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, since September 2024, Russia has dramatically increased its Shahed drone launches from around 200 per week to over 1,000 per week by March 2025, with salvos occurring almost every other day. Over the past seven months, there has not been a single uninterrupted three-day period without a mass Shahed drone launch—mass matters. Even though Ukraine has sustained its ability to shoot down the drones at around 80–85 percent, that means 67 drones got through and hit predominantly civilian areas.', 'Q2: How did Russia manage to scale up its drone launches?', 'A2: Russia managed to scale up its drone launches primarily through expanding its domestic production of Shahed-type drones, sometimes called “Geran” in Russia. While originally designed in Iran, these drones are now manufactured at large facilities within Russia, such as the plants in Alabuga and the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant (IEMZ Kupol). To support production, Russia sources key electronic components internationally, with China as a major supplier, and reportedly continues to use smuggled Western electronics as well. The initial drone campaign benefited from importing drones directly from Iran, which provided the time Russia needed to establish indigenous manufacturing capabilities. Recently, Russia has enhanced production capacity further, particularly at the IEMZ Kupol facility, and has developed advanced variants such as the Shahed-238 loitering munition, according to reports. What should concern U.S. defense officials is that Washington cannot scale long-range attack drone production to the extent seen in Russia—despite the United States having an economy more than 10 times larger than Russia.', 'Q3: How will these attacks affect peace talks?', 'A3: The only constant in the Kremlin’s playbook is violence. Moscow is buying time for further battlefield gains. Putin signals openness to diplomacy, including pointing out Istanbul as the venue for “direct” talks. But at the same time, he orders increased drone and missile attacks and conducts a diplomatic switch, sending a low-profile delegation to peace talks.', 'The pattern held over the weekend. Hours after President Trump’s phone call with Putin on May 19, Russia launched its biggest air raid on Kyiv to date. The strike was calibrated violence, a reminder that the Kremlin can raise—or lower—the pain threshold at will. Trump publicly condemned the attack, but the message from Moscow was unmistakable: Battlefield momentum underwrites bargaining power.', 'We can expect more of the same. After Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan visited Moscow, the Kremlin proposed a second round of direct talks. Although we can expect an increase in periodic meetings towards peace, there is no reason to assume a matching lull in missile salvos. In Putin’s strategy, sustained coercion is not a negotiating chip to be traded away as a goodwill gesture; it is the very leverage he intends to bring to the table.', 'Q4: How can Ukraine offset these drone attacks?', 'A4: Blunting Moscow’s drone blitz requires more than patchwork fixes—it demands a layered, offense-defense strategy. First is strengthening the shield. Battlespace needs more diverse interceptors: Patriot and IRIS-T batteries for high-end threats; mobile anti-drone teams and acoustic sensor grids for the low-slow flyers; and emerging capabilities like high-energy lasers to cheaply neutralize swarms. Western backers should support these efforts, along with codeveloping new capabilities with Ukrainian industry, like AI-enabled autonomous antiaircraft turrets.', 'Second, precision fires must reach deep—striking assembly plants, storage depots, and makeshift launch pads that power Russia’s Shahed conveyor belt. Third, Ukraine and its partners should focus on strangling the supply lines. Ukraine will need to work with allies to choke off the microelectronics trickling in from China and other enablers. Finally, disrupting the signal is critical. Increasing offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare is key so that even when a drone slips the net, its guidance goes dark, and it tumbles harmlessly from the sky.', 'Combined, efforts to cut supply lines and increase interception rates can blunt Russia’s coercive air and missile campaign. Even though Ukraine will not be able to stop every attack, it can reduce Moscow’s ability to use a punishment strategy as part of its larger “peace” negotiation playbook. That will make it easier for the United States and Ukraine’s other backers to create a framework for real dialogue and the type of direct talks needed to end the war.', 'Yasir Atalan is a data fellow in the Futures Lab at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.
