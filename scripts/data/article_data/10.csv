The unarmed activists will likely be transported to Israeli detention or “immediately deported,” says Ann Wright, a U.S. military veteran who has participated in four Freedom Flotilla journeys and now serves on the steering committee of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition.

Israeli soldiers in the early hours of Monday — they have not, the activists, been heard of or located since. Those detained include the renowned Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg; Thiago Ávila, who we just heard, from Brazil; Yasemin Acar from Germany — she was scheduled to join us on today’s broadcast, before she and the rest of the group were forcibly taken by the Israeli Navy.

Israeli commandos had intercepted the vessel, arranged by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, off the coast of Egypt overnight, detaining passengers including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.', '“The passengers are undergoing medical examinations to ensure they are in good health,” Israel’s Foreign Ministry said shortly after the arrival in port of the British-flagged Madleen.', 'It was the latest in a series of ships that have tried to break Israel’s years-long naval blockade of the Gaza Strip, where a devastating war has destroyed much of the territory and, experts warn, the population is at risk of famine. Most ships have been stopped by Israeli forces or been prevented from leaving their ports of origin.', 'The Foreign Ministry said the 12 passengers, including a French member of the European Parliament, “are expected to return to their home countries.” Israeli officials portrayed the journey as a publicity stunt, mocking what the Foreign Ministry described as a “tiny amount of aid” for people in the war-battered territory.', 'Follow World news', 'The Freedom Flotilla Coalition had said the amount of aid, including rice, baby formula and medical supplies, was symbolic.

That incident sparked international condemnation and a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Israel.', 'A United Nations report into the deadly 2010 incident found that while Israel’s naval blockade was a “legitimate security measure,” Israel’s decision to board the vessels with “such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning” was “excessive and unreasonable.” The panel also found that the flotilla had “no violent intentions” and was entitled to its political expression, but “acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade.”', 'In the latest attempt, members of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition documented their sea journey on social media, posting live updates tracking the Madleen’s location.

The crew said it was responding to a Mayday call and had a “moral and legal duty to protect those rescued at sea.”', 'Photos posted by Hassan showed several people swimming in the ocean from a small, overcrowded boat with what the group said was about 30 to 40 migrants.

I felt an enormous sense of responsibility and a little pride,” she says with a smile.', '“I’m grateful to these activists who have devoted themselves, left their lives and comforts behind, and stood with Gaza despite all the risks,” she says of the group of 12 activists, who include Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament.', '“This is the highest form of humanity and self-sacrifice in the face of danger.”', 'Khader sits on another sofa with six-year-old Sandy. He holds out his phone with a photo of the Madleen on it, flying the Palestinian flag.', 'Madleen has been fishing since she was 15, a familiar figure heading out on her father’s boat, getting to know all the other fishermen and also becoming well-known to international solidarity activists.', 'In addition to bringing home the fish, Madleen is also a skilled cook, preparing seasonal fish dishes that were so famously tasty that she had a list of clients waiting to buy them from her. Especially popular were the dishes made with Gaza’s ubiquitous sardines.', 'But now, she can’t fish any more and neither can Khader because Israel destroyed their boats and an entire storage room full of fishing gear during the war.', '“We’ve lost everything – the fruit of a lifetime,” she says.', 'But her loss is not just about income. It’s about identity – her deep connection to the sea and fishing. It’s even about the simple joy of eating fish, which she used to enjoy “10 times a week”.', '“Now fish is too expensive if you can find it at all. Only a few fishermen still have any gear left, and they risk their lives just to catch a little,” she says.', '“Everything has changed. We now crave fish in the middle of this famine we’re living through.”', 'After the air strike near the family home in November 2023, Madleen’s family’s first displacement was to Khan Younis, following Israeli army instructions that they would be safer there.', 'After searching for shelter, they ended up in a small apartment with 40 other displaced relatives, and then Madleen went into labour.', '“It was a difficult, brutal birth. No pain relief, no medical care. I was forced to leave the hospital right after giving birth. There were no beds available because of the overwhelming number of wounded,” she says.', 'When she returned to the shelter, things were just as dire. “We didn’t have a mattress or even a blanket, neither me nor the kids,” she said.', '“I had to sleep on the floor with my newborn baby. It was physically exhausting.”', 'She then had to tend to four children in an enclave where baby formula, diapers and even the most basic food items were almost impossible to find.', 'The war, she says, has reshaped her understanding of suffering and hardship.', 'In 2022, she and Khader were struggling to make ends meet between Israel’s gunship blockade and the frequent destruction of their boats. There was also the added burden of being a mother with small children and undertaking such physically taxing work.', 'But now, things have gotten far worse.', '“There’s no such thing as ‘difficult’ any more. Nothing compares to the humiliation, hunger and horror we’ve seen in this war,” she says.', '', '', '', 'Throughout the war, Madleen remained in touch with international friends and solidarity activists she had met through the years.', '“I would share my reality with them,” she says.', '“They came to understand the situation through me. They felt like family.”', 'Her friends abroad offered both emotional and financial support, and she is grateful for them, saying they made her feel that Gaza wasn’t forgotten, that people still cared.', 'She is also grateful for being remembered in the naming of the Madleen, but she worries that Israeli authorities will not let the ship reach Gaza, citing past attempts that were intercepted.', '“Intercepting the ship would be the least of it. What’s more worrying is the possibility of a direct assault like what happened to the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in 2010 when several people were killed.”', 'Regardless of what happens, Madleen believes the mission’s true message has already been delivered.', '“This is a call to break the global silence, to draw the world’s attention to what’s happening in Gaza.
