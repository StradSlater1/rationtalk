The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.', 'Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is ""treading water"" and ""worse than what the topline number says,"" Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\'s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .', 'Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\'s ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" could limit their growth, Flowers says.', 'The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.', 'Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could ""kill the golden goose, so to speak,"" Flowers says. ""Health care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.""', 'Leisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.', 'Tariffs are already ""starting to bite,"" Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. ""Going forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.""', 'The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.', ""Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter's latest job-seeker confidence index."", '""It\'s an insider vs. outsider labor market,"" Flowers says. ""If you have a job, it\'s actually pretty good."" Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But ""the job-finding rate is really slipping"" for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.', 'Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.', '\'We\'ve told young people in this country for decades, \'Go to college.\' And they did,"" Flowers says. ""Now all the jobs they want, whether it\'s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.""', '""We\'re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,"" Flowers says.', 'Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.', '""All Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,"" according to the report.

However, the guts of the report indicate that fissures may be spreading, some economists warn.', '“I don’t want to play Debbie Downer by just reading the headlines and concluding nothing to worry about,” Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon’s chief economist, told CNN. “In my opinion, we are starting to see an acceleration of labor market slowdown.”', 'Economists were expecting the economy to have added 130,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.', 'Friday’s report painted a picture of a “steady but cautious” labor market in the face of swelling economic uncertainty, said Ger Doyle, regional president for North America at employment firm ManpowerGroup.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDow jumps 550 points as Wall Street tries to cope with trade war, Trump-Musk spat', 'President Donald Trump’s sweeping policy moves, especially a whipsaw approach to massive import tariffs, have driven consumer sentiment lower, rattled markets and clouded businesses’ lines of sight.', '“This is not a freeze, but a temporary chill,” Doyle wrote in commentary Friday. “Employees are staying put, employers are holding steady, and everyone is waiting for clearer signs.”', 'While the pace of job growth remains fairly solid, this year’s gains were even softer than initially thought, Friday’s report showed.', 'March’s and April’s gains were revised down by a combined 95,000 jobs, resulting in employment increasing by an average monthly clip of nearly 124,000 jobs this year.', 'That may be above the 100,000 threshold (below which would be an indicator of potential weakness), but, excluding recession years, it’s the lowest average monthly gain for January through May in the past 30 years, an analysis of BLS data shows.', 'In the years following the economy-upheaving pandemic, job growth has slowed, but it has not collapsed. The gains have remained solid enough to fuel consumer spending and put the economy on track for a “soft landing” of reining in inflation without triggering a recession.', 'May’s jobs report marks the 53rd consecutive month that the US economy has added jobs, the second-longest streak of employment expansion on record (behind the post-Great Recession/pre-Covid market of late-2010 to early 2020), BLS data shows.', 'However, economists have warned that the Trump administration’s frenetic trade policy and other actions — including drastic cutbacks to federal spending, layoffs of government workers, and reductions in immigration — not only threaten those soft landing odds but also heighten recession risks.', '“The May jobs report still has everyone waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, wrote Friday. “This report shows the job market standing tall, but as economic headwinds stack up cumulatively, it’s only a matter of time before the job market starts straining against those headwinds.”', 'Not knowing the size and breadth of tariffs (but knowing they very well might change), for example, has hindered businesses’ abilities to operate and plan: They don’t know what their costs will be in three months, let alone three days from now; and it’s even more unclear whether consumers will keep spending.', 'Outlooks have quickly become opaque.', 'Scores of the largest public US companies have suspended their forecasts for future earnings, temporarily blinding analysts and investors.

Almost the entirety of the month’s employment gains (nearly 91%) was concentrated in just two sectors: health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality.', 'Half of all major industries added jobs in May (or lost jobs, if one’s a glass-half-empty type of person), according to the BLS’ employment “diffusion index.” Across manufacturing, only 41.7% of industries added jobs.', '“When manufacturing is losing jobs and the diffusion index suggests those losses are broad, it’s more indicative of an industry-wide phenomenon, and could warrant concern for the broader economy,” Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s senior economist, wrote in a note Friday.', 'Overall last month, the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs.', 'The largest job losses in May, however, occurred in the federal government, which saw its employment bloodletting worsen due to the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce and gut agencies and spending.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDOGE layoffs may have compromised the accuracy of government data', 'The federal government has posted job losses for four consecutive months, dropping 13,000 jobs in February, 11,000 in March, 13,000 in April, and another 22,000 in May.', 'There’s more to come on that front. The bulk of the losses to date likely reflect early retirements versus Department of Government Efficiency-driven layoffs, Swonk said. The losses from the latter could be spread out over many months to come: Not all federal workers were laid off immediately and other actions are being challenged in court.', 'The federal workforce represents a tiny share of overall employment; however, Trump’s federal cuts appear to causing collateral damage in the private sector, Swonk said, noting job losses at scientific labs.', 'BLS data shows that scientific, research and development services lost 3,900 jobs in May, which followed a 4,400-job loss in April. On a year-to-date basis, that industry is running in the red for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'The BLS’ monthly snapshot of the labor market is composed of two surveys: One of businesses (which measures employment, hours and earnings), and one of households (which provides demographic data and feeds into the all-important unemployment rate).', 'While the household survey tends to have more volatility, May’s readings from that particular wing of the report rang more alarm bells than usual.', 'The unemployment rate didn’t budge, but more workers left the labor market. The labor participation rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 62.4%. And while the labor force losses were broad-based, they were more heavily concentrated in women over the age of 55 and men of prime working age (25 to 54), Swonk said.', 'The household survey also indicated that more people who were not working were instead in school or training.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump met with Jerome Powell today to scold him about rates.

The report offered a sound snapshot of an economy facing headwinds, as consumer spending has slowed.', 'But the previous two months showed weaker growth than previously thought, with a combined 95,000 in downward job revisions.', '“The labor market is lukewarm,"" said Guy Berger, director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute. “So far, we’re adding enough jobs to prevent the employment from spiraling downwards. It won’t take a lot of further weakening for that to take a turn for worse.”', 'For months, economists have kept a close watch for signs that White House economic policies, including tariffs, federal government job cuts and frozen research grants, could trigger widespread job losses.

The decline partially reflects the exit of immigrants from the labor market. More than a million foreign-born workers have exited the workforce since March.', 'The bulk of job gains in May stemmed from a handful of service-based industries. Health care added some 62,000 jobs in May. Job creation also sped up in leisure and hospitality, with restaurants and bars adding 30,000 new jobs. Social assistance, which includes services for families, added 16,000 jobs.', 'Job growth was sluggish elsewhere. Some sectors showed signs of weakness that could be a response to higher trade levies. Manufacturing, retail, construction, transportation and warehousing lost or barely added jobs.', 'The federal government shed 22,000 jobs, a reflection of the Trump administration’s cuts, which have amounted to nearly 60,000 since January. The full scope of the cuts is still to be seen as many exiting employees remain on paid leave or severance, and are not yet counted as unemployment. State payrolls barely budged.', 'Temporary help services employment shed more than 20,000 jobs. Job loss is the industry is often seen as a bellwether for economic downturns.', 'Most white-collar sectors shed jobs — reflecting a tougher labor market for office workers, including recent college graduates.', 'Overall, the labor market remains on firm ground, policymakers say, likely giving the Federal Reserve ammunition to leave interest rates untouched. Since January, the Fed has been in wait-and-see mode amid a murky economic horizon and open questions about the impact of Trump’s policies, particularly on tariffs. So far, the overall economy has weathered the trade war.', '“This makes the Fed feel a little better this morning because they don’t want to cut rates with inflation pretty stubborn still,” said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America.', 'For years, the labor market propped up the broader economy, but in recent months, as consumers have begun to pull back their spending and businesses exercise caution, economists have watched the labor market with renewed vigilance. Applications for unemployment benefits have risen in recent weeks, reaching the highest level since October. The total number of Americans receiving jobless benefits has risen to the highest level since late 2021. The U.S. workforce, especially recent college graduates and those reentering the labor market, are facing longer spells of unemployment.', 'Lily Weinberg, an epidemiologist in Southern California, has been on a job hunt since last October and has applied for roughly 150 jobs without any offers.

U.S. employers cut about 93,000 jobs in May, a decrease from April, but a nearly 50 percent increase from the same time last year, according to a report released Thursday from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a global outplacement firm.

And factories lost 8,000 jobs last month.', 'Average hourly wages rose 0.4% from April and 3.9% from a year earlier – a bit higher than forecast.', 'Trump’s aggressive and unpredictable policies – especially his sweeping taxes on imports – have muddied the outlook for the economy and the job market and raised fears that the American economy could be headed toward recession. But so far the damage hasn’t shown up clearly in government economic data.', '“Even during peak trade uncertainty, the labor market remained fairly solid,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a commentary. “Payrolls are still robust territory and, although there are clearly cracks forming and employment data is likely to show clearer signs of softening towards the end of summer, this is not a labor market which is starting to fall apart at the seams.”', 'Economists expect Trump’s policies will have a toll on America’s economy, the world’s largest. His massive taxes on imports — tariffs — are expected to raise costs for U.S. companies that buy raw materials, equipment and components from overseas and force them to cut back hiring or even lay off workers. Billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed federal workers and cancelled government contracts. Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration is expected to make it harder for businesses to find enough workers.', 'For the most part, though, any widespread damage has yet to appear in the government’s economic data.', 'The U.S. economy and job market have proven surprisingly resilient in recent years. When the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve raised their benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, the higher borrowing costs were widely expected to tip the United States into a recession, which they did not.', 'Still, the job market has clearly decelerated. So far this year, American employers have added an average of less than 124,000 a month. That is down 26% from last year, down almost 43% from 2023, and a down whopping 67% compared with 2022.', 'The modest job gains and steady unemployment rate are likely to keep the Fed on the sidelines for at least the next few months, economists said. The central bank Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times last year.', 'Fed chair Jerome Powell and most other Fed policymakers have voiced concern that Trump’s tariffs could push up inflation later this year, which they would seek to counter by raising rates. The Fed is only likely to accelerate interest rate cuts if the job market sharply deteriorates, which didn’t happen last month.', 'Recent economic reports have sent mixed signals.', 'The Labor Department reported Tuesday that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly to 7.4 million in April — seemingly a good sign. But the same report showed that layoffs ticked up and the number of Americans quitting their jobs fell, a sign they were less confident they could find something better elsewhere.', 'Surveys by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, found that both American manufacturing and services businesses were contracting last month.', 'And the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level in eight months.', 'Jobless claims — a proxy for layoffs — still remain low by historical standards, suggesting that employers are reluctant to cut staff despite uncertainty over Trump’s policies. They likely remember how hard it was to bring people back from the massive but short-lived layoffs of the 2020 COVID-19 recession as the U.S. economy bounced back with unexpected strength.', 'Still, the job market has clearly decelerated. So far this year, American employers have added an average of less than 124,000 a month. That is down 26% from last year, down almost 43% from 2023, and a down whopping 67% compared with 2022.', 'Trump’s tariffs — and the erratic way he rolls them out, suspends them and conjures up new ones — have already buffeted the economy.', '“Employers have been hoarding labor in the face of massive corrosive uncertainty,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “We believe firms have been reluctant to lay off workers until they saw the extent of the Trump tariffs. Now that the tariffs are out in the open, we believe most firms see the writing on the wall and will start workforce reductions right now.”', 'America’s gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — fell at a 0.2% annual pace from January through March this year.', 'A surge of imports shaved 5 percentage points off growth during the first quarter as companies rushed to bring in foreign products ahead of Trump’s tariffs. Imports plunged by a record 16% in April as Trump’s levies took effect. The drop in foreign goods could mean fewer jobs at the warehouses that store them and the trucking companies that haul them around, wrote Michael Madowitz, an economist at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute.', 'Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.', 'Left: FILE PHOTO: Employees work inside a Nucor steel factory in Blytheville, Arkansas, U.S., March 28, 2025.

As it turns out, according to the new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the totals easily exceeded expectations. NBC News reported:', 'The United States added 139,000 jobs in May, more than expected but pointing to a labor market that continues to slow. The employment data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics exceeded forecasts for about 120,000 payroll gains but marked a decline from the revised 147,000 jobs added in April. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, remaining near historic lows.', 'Earlier this week, Donald Trump published a one-sentence statement to his social media platform, in which the president boasted, “Because of Tariffs, our Economy is BOOMING!”', 'The data suggests otherwise. There’s nothing especially wrong with the preliminary topline totals from May — 139,000 jobs is a mediocre number but hardly a disaster — though there are other signs of trouble. For example, the revised jobs totals from March and April were sharply lower, pointing to a job market that appears to be cooling.', 'Indeed, consider the broader context: Over the first five months of 2025, the latest data suggest the economy has added 619,000 jobs. Over the first five months of 2024 — when Trump said the economy was terrible — the total was nearly 898,000 jobs.

A variety of adjectives come to mind, but “BOOMING” isn’t one of them.', 'NBC News’ report added, “Even as the economy continued to add jobs at a relatively steady clip last month, the report showed other signs of a weakening labor market. The ratio of employed workers to the total population fell to 59.7%, the lowest rate since the pandemic. And an alternative measure of unemployment that includes ‘discouraged’ workers, or those who have stopped looking for work, returned to a post-pandemic high of 4.5%.”', 'In recent weeks, there’s been a lot of discussion in economic and finance circles about when and whether the White House tariffs and trade policies would start to affect the domestic job market.

Over the last twenty years, it has averaged 5.8%.', 'Official government reports on the labor market have shown it has been surprisingly resilient to tariff pressures. Still, economists and private sector reports indicate a rough road ahead.', 'Economists predict that higher tariffs will cause companies to pull back on their highest cost—labor. That could mean fewer new jobs or layoffs.', ""Uncertainty around tariff policies has already caused businesses to hold off on investments like hiring, according to anecdotal reports. But so far, that hasn't shown up in official government data.

Growth is moderating but not halting and is now supported by a narrower set of drivers including consumer services, AI capex, and broader infrastructure investment trends. Meanwhile, however, the labor market is still fundamentally tight: the unemployment rate is 4.2% today and has been pinned in the low-4% range for the past year. Slower net migration means that very little job growth is needed to hold unemployment at low levels. To us, this continues to add up to a backdrop where the Fed’s next move is still more cutting, but it will not be in a rush to do so. We continue to embed two cuts late this year.

"Washington DC, San Francisco, Orlando, and New York City Join with Las Vegas, Miami, Los Angeles, Florida, Nevada, Texas, and California as May Jobs Report Sparks Uncertainty for US Travel Industry",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/what-happened-to-us-job-market-with-travel-and-tourism-industry/,"['', '', 'Saturday, June 7, 2025', 'Washington DC, San Francisco, Orlando, and New York City now join with Las Vegas, Miami, Los Angeles, Florida, Nevada, Texas, and California in facing a rising wave of economic uncertainty. The May jobs report has sent shockwaves through the US travel industry. While the numbers show growth, the details reveal cracks beneath the surface. These iconic travel destinations—Washington DC, San Francisco, Orlando, and New York City—are not alone. Las Vegas, Miami, Los Angeles, and key states like Florida, Nevada, Texas, and California are all feeling the same pressure. Job gains are slowing. Layoffs are rising. Immigration curbs and tariff tensions are pulling the brakes on hiring. Now, hotel operators, airlines, and tourism boards are bracing for impact. Will this signal a travel downturn? Could summer’s momentum stall? As Washington DC and the rest of these top destinations watch closely, the question is no longer if the travel market will shift—but how fast.', 'The US economy added 139,000 jobs in May 2025, beating some expectations, but beneath the surface, trouble is brewing. For the American travel and tourism industry, the signs are becoming harder to ignore.', 'Advertisement', 'As employers grow more cautious, and layoffs rise in key sectors, the momentum that’s fueled record-setting travel demand could soon begin to fade. Tariffs, government job cuts, and a shrinking labor force tied to immigration policy are starting to ripple into airports, hotels, and hospitality businesses nationwide.', 'What was once a thriving post-pandemic rebound now faces a cloudy horizon.', 'With 22,000 federal jobs lost in May alone—and over 59,000 cut since January—the slowdown is real. The government’s sweeping job reductions are already affecting airport security lines, travel processing, and immigration checkpoints.', 'Meanwhile, tourism-rich cities like Washington D.C., San Francisco, Orlando, and New York City depend heavily on federal contracts and public infrastructure support. With fewer workers on the ground, service delays are rising, and maintenance backlogs are growing.', 'Moreover, President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies, including the 50% increase on steel and aluminum imports, are raising costs for airlines, hotel builders, and transport operators. Supply chains are tightening, investment is slowing, and tourism development projects face fresh hurdles.', 'Leisure and hospitality added 48,000 jobs in May, helping to keep the overall employment number steady. But the foundation may be more fragile than it looks.', 'Many hotels, theme parks, and restaurants are still hiring to keep up with summer demand, but employers remain cautious. With fewer immigrant workers and a narrowing labor pool, staffing gaps persist. Labor costs are climbing while customer expectations stay high.', 'In tourist hubs like Las Vegas, Miami, and Los Angeles, hotels report challenges finding qualified workers—especially for cleaning, food service, and front-desk roles. Some properties have reduced room availability just to maintain quality, even at the expense of lost revenue.', 'A key driver of travel-sector strain? Immigration policies.', 'The administration’s crackdown on work permits, visa renewals, and border enforcement has created ripple effects across service-based industries. From airport baggage handlers to hotel housekeepers, entire segments of the travel workforce are shrinking.', 'This has hit hardest in sectors that rely heavily on seasonal and migrant labor—like beach resorts, national parks, and airport concession operators. As visas go unrenewed and labor markets tighten, many employers are delaying expansion or scaling back operations.', 'Moreover, fewer immigrants entering the workforce means slower consumer spending—a trend that could reduce domestic leisure travel later this year.', 'Wages rose by 15 cents in May to an average of $36.24 an hour, with annual wage growth nudging from 3.8% to 3.9%. While that’s a mild uptick, it’s far from the steep increases seen in early 2022, when pandemic recovery drove labor shortages.', 'Still, with tariffs threatening to reignite inflation, the Federal Reserve is watching closely. For now, the Fed is holding interest rates steady, waiting to see whether trade pressures cool or flare.', 'If inflation rises again due to import costs, travel prices—especially flights and hotels—could spike in response, leading to weaker consumer demand in late summer or fall.', 'The May jobs report also revealed troubling losses in manufacturing and retail—two sectors closely tied to travel behavior.', 'Manufacturing lost 8,000 jobs last month, while retail dropped 6,500. These losses hint at softening consumer demand and reduced production of goods critical to travel, such as luggage, apparel, electronics, and transport equipment.', 'A slowdown in retail and manufacturing may also point to fewer corporate travel bookings, trade event cancellations, and a decline in business travel recovery that had started to rebound earlier this year.', 'States like Florida, Nevada, Texas, and California, which rely heavily on tourism dollars and service-sector employment, are particularly vulnerable.', 'In Orlando, some theme parks have paused hiring for seasonal roles. In Honolulu, hospitality groups are reporting higher turnover and growing reliance on short-term staffing agencies. Even in Denver, tour operators have begun delaying new investments in eco-tourism infrastructure due to rising materials costs.', 'Local economies tied to travel spending could see ripple effects by late summer if job growth continues to decelerate and inflation pressures mount.', 'With job growth slowing and confidence dipping, the second half of 2025 may challenge the travel industry’s resilience.', 'Travelers, facing higher prices and less certainty, may cut back on trips. Airlines may delay aircraft orders or trim schedules. Hotel operators could shift focus from growth to cost control. Meanwhile, tourism boards may redirect budgets from promotion to preservation.', 'Analysts warn that average monthly job gains may fall to 75,000 by year’s end—just enough to sustain, but not to grow. That means the U.S. travel industry, which has powered through two years of recovery, now stands at a delicate crossroads.', 'The U.S. travel industry has been a powerhouse of growth since bouncing back from the pandemic slump. Travelers have returned in record numbers, and planes, cruise ships, and hotels have been running at near-full capacity. But behind the scenes, a quieter story is unfolding—a story about jobs. In May and June 2025, the U.S. job market in the travel sector is showing signs of change, with hiring patterns shifting across hotels, airlines, cruise lines, and tourism boards.', 'From front desks to flight decks, the landscape is being reshaped by economic uncertainty, labor shortages, policy changes, and rising operational costs. Here’s a closer, human-focused look at how the U.S. job market is moving across key travel sectors.', 'Hotels across the U.S.—especially in tourist-heavy destinations like Las Vegas, Orlando, Miami, and New York City—are still seeing strong bookings as the summer rush builds. But when it comes to hiring, the pace is slowing.', 'Many properties are struggling to find enough qualified workers. Housekeeping, front-desk roles, and kitchen staff remain in high demand. However, hoteliers are increasingly relying on part-time or temporary staff due to ongoing concerns about wage inflation and rising operational costs.', 'Automation is also playing a growing role. Some major hotel chains are rolling out self-check-in kiosks and digital concierge services to ease the pressure on thin staffing levels. While this helps with efficiency, it also means fewer full-time roles are opening up.', 'For job seekers, this creates a double-edged sword. Opportunities exist, but they often come with tighter schedules, lower job security, and more competition.', 'The cruise industry is back at sea with strong passenger numbers and a healthy appetite for travel. Destinations like the Caribbean, Alaska, and Mediterranean are seeing a high volume of bookings. However, the onboard job market isn’t keeping pace with the customer demand.', 'Cruise companies have become more cautious about rehiring at pre-pandemic levels. While entertainment and hospitality roles on ships are gradually returning, there’s a noticeable lag in support staff and maintenance crew recruitment.', 'Part of the challenge lies in tightening immigration policies and fewer available work visas, especially for international crew members who typically fill these roles. As a result, many cruise lines are operating with skeleton teams, placing additional strain on existing staff.', 'This is affecting onboard service quality, and passenger satisfaction scores are dipping slightly in response. While hiring continues, cruise lines are focusing more on multi-skilled employees who can wear multiple hats at sea.', 'The airline industry remains in high gear, with airports across California, Texas, and Florida bustling with travelers. But the jobs fueling this movement—pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, and technicians—are increasingly under pressure.', 'In May 2025, several major airlines including American, United, and Southwest slowed their hiring of new flight attendants and support staff, citing rising maintenance costs and uncertainty around fuel prices tied to global trade policies.', 'Pilot hiring remains strong but highly competitive. Meanwhile, baggage handlers, ticket agents, and gate agents are in short supply at smaller regional airports. Airlines are also grappling with delays in aircraft deliveries due to supply chain bottlenecks, which is indirectly affecting crew scheduling and operational planning.', 'Despite packed planes, the mood in the aviation workforce is mixed—there’s pride in recovery, but concern over whether airlines are pushing staff too hard, too fast.', 'Local and state tourism boards are in a unique position. They’re tasked with promoting travel while managing growing strains on infrastructure, staffing, and sustainability.', 'In cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Honolulu, tourism boards are seeing record inquiries and event bookings. Yet, their teams are often smaller than before the pandemic. Budget constraints and public-sector hiring freezes have made it hard to keep up.', 'Hiring for marketing, public relations, and visitor support roles has slowed. Many tourism boards are relying on freelance contractors and partnerships with local businesses to fill gaps. Seasonal guides and event coordinators are still being hired, but often on a short-term or hourly basis.', 'This leaner staffing model is efficient on paper but can lead to burnout and slower response times—especially when dealing with spikes in visitor traffic during peak months.', 'Much of the hiring strain across the travel industry ties back to immigration policy shifts. In 2025, federal efforts to reduce work permits and temporary visas have had a direct impact on staffing across all sectors.', 'The ripple effects are most visible in hospitality and airport services, where immigrant labor has traditionally filled essential roles. With fewer visas issued, the labor pool is tightening. Employers are forced to raise wages, cut hours, or delay hiring entirely.', 'For travelers, this may mean longer wait times, slower service, or fewer available amenities. For job seekers, especially those already in the U.S., there may be more openings—but many come with intense workloads and reduced benefits.', 'Looking ahead to the rest of summer 2025, the U.S. travel job market stands at a crossroads.', 'Will demand remain high enough to justify new hiring surges? Can the industry navigate tighter budgets and a reduced labor pool? Will travelers feel the effects of a leaner, more stressed workforce?', 'The answers are still forming. But one thing is clear: the people behind the scenes—hotel clerks, cabin crews, dock workers, and destination marketers—are working harder than ever. And their stories are just as important as the places they help bring to life.', 'The May jobs report doesn’t signal collapse. But it does send a message.', 'The U.S. travel economy has shown strength, creativity, and determination through challenges. However, policy changes, economic pressures, and workforce shifts are starting to leave visible marks. If conditions tighten further, especially during the vital summer stretch, the industry could face its most complex season since 2021.', 'Travelers are still eager. Bookings remain strong. But behind the scenes, the engine is straining. It’s a moment that calls for smart decisions, strategic investments, and bold leadership from every corner of the tourism ecosystem.', 'Source: USA Today', 'Advertisement', 'Tags: airline hiring, American labor market, California, Dallas, Denver, Federal Reserve policy, florida, honolulu, hotel staffing, Immigration Impact, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, May 2025 jobs data, Miami, Nevada, New York City, Orlando, San Francisco, summer travel outlook, Texas, Trump tariffs, U.S. jobs report, U.S. tourism economy, United States, Washington D.C.', '', '', ""I want to receive travel news and trade event update from Travel And Tour World.

But many forecasters reckon the pullback will intensify in the months ahead.', 'Trump’s trade strategy lies at the center of the projected downshift. He paused the high double-digit tariffs he slapped on dozens of countries in April and in May agreed to slash levies on Chinese imports from 145% to a still-elevated 30%. China agreed to broadly similar concessions.', 'But the moves hinge on further U.S. deals with China and other countries.

Mortgage Rates to Reverse Recent Decline as Unemployment Holds Steady,https://www.redfin.com/news/may-jobs-report-unemployment-2025/,"['The official May jobs report remained strong on the surface and mortgage rates will reverse a decline from recent days following a weak ADP employment report earlier this week. Under the hood, however, there are clear warning signs in this report, even though the labor market has generally held up better than expected under high tariffs.', 'A surprisingly weak ADP jobs report on Wednesday drove a fall in mortgage rates, but the official May jobs report came in slightly stronger than consensus, which means mortgage rates are likely to reverse the earlier decline. There were 139,000 jobs created in May, slightly lower than last month’s gain of 147,000 jobs, but higher than the 130,000 expected. The unemployment rate increased only marginally from 4.19% to 4.24%. On the surface, the labor market is healthy so far, despite tariff volatility. Because immigration has declined so much over the past two years, the “break even” number of jobs needed to keep employment levels steady is now lower. That means job creation can decline without affecting unemployment.', 'However, under the surface there are clear reasons to suspect the labor market is softening. Federal government job decline is accelerating as the impact of the DOGE cuts become apparent. Manufacturing is shedding jobs and the bulk of the job creation is being driven by health and education, noncyclical sectors. Importantly, the unemployment rate only held because of the drop in household participation. Without that drop, the unemployment rate would be closer to 4.5%. That means people lost jobs and the unemployment rate only held steady because so many gave up and left the labor force. The way to reconcile this with 139,000 jobs created is that these numbers come from two different surveys. The payroll survey, which gives us the job creation number, has been consistently overstating job creation for a while. These numbers have been repeatedly downwardly revised in subsequent months. Indeed, this month, the report includes a downward revision of 95,000 jobs for the previous two months. And the QCEW, a lagging report from the Census that provides more accurate estimates, indicates that today’s payroll number is likely overstated.', 'Overall, however, the labor market is not showing as many cracks as expected under high tariffs. It’s possible that the economy and businesses are better equipped to absorb these tariff levels than anticipated. It is also possible that the economy will only hold up for so long. With tariff policies being so volatile, many businesses may be holding off on making major decisions on headcount and prices—hoping that the policies get unwound.
