The preview, which lasted less than an hour, showcased new and previously announced PS5 titles as well as a new controller."", 'The last State of Play was in February and featured previews of games from the studio behind Returnal, including Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, Lies of P: Overture and Saros.', ""This time, Sony released a few teasers for many of its most-hyped games, including Ghost of Yōtei, Silent Hill F, Pragmata, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remaster of the original Final Fantasy Tactics and even more levels from last year's fan-favorite hit Astro Bot. "", 'The trailer fest also included a reveal of a new official Sony fighting stick, which Sony has given the codename Project Defiant (a final name is forthcoming). While it doesn\'t have a release date or price, the company noted that it will have wired or ""ultra-low latency"" wireless connectivity, a durable design and a sling carry case included for easy transport.  ', 'State of Play streamed live on YouTube and Twitch starting at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET).', '007 First Light', ""We got our first look at the new James Bond game from Amazon MGM Studios, 007 First Light. From the trailer, it's clear that the game will cover the origins of the super-spy set in what seems like the groovy 1960s. Bond is young and eager, getting his start at MI6, with missions that will take him around the world. 007 First Light is coming in 2026."", 'The spiritual sequel to Ghost of Tsushima had a trailer that showed more vibes than gameplay, pretty much just teeing up a gameplay reveal stream coming in July. Ah well.', ""Ignore that word salad title -- this is a heretofore unlooked-for Marvel fighting game from Arc System Works, famed for the Guilty Gear and BlazBlue series as well as Dragon Ball FighterZ. While a little more grounded than Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 (where are my super jumps?), Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls will have 4v4 tag team battles, promising tight gameplay and fun new costumes for Marvel heroes. It's coming to PS5 and PC in 2026. "", 'A new game in the Lumines universe is coming from the creators of Tetris Effect: Connected, and you can see the impact with a synesthetic combination of music and visuals working together. Lumines Arise comes out in the fall of 2025 for PS5.', ""Our second big trailer for Pragmata, Capcom's next single-player adventure, shows even more of the relationship between the astrogear-wearing protagonist and the robot (looking like a small girl) with more capability than she seems. Pragmata comes out in 2026."", 'Romeo is a Dead Man, a new game from Grasshopper Manufacture, was created by noted game developer Suda51 (Killer7). The trailer opened with a bloody protagonist origin transitioning into gameplay of him, newly reborn, slashing and shooting his way through hordes of dead demon-like things. This game -- and whatever panoply of styles and oddball features suitable for Suda51 -- is coming in 2026.', 'Another trailer for the next Silent Hill game set in 1960s Japan, this game interspersed cutscenes with some gameplay of main character Hinako, a schoolgirl, fighting horrific mannequin-like monsters in schools and shrines across a mist-covered town. The game comes out on Sept. 25.', 'The next game in the Bloodstained series of Castlevania-likes is another side-scrolling, grim action game, which is coming out in 2026.', 'A new Digimon game from Bandai Namco, Digimon Story: Time Stranger is a story-rich RPG with a cel-shaded anime style set in a Japan invaded by monsters. The game comes out Oct. 3.', 'A remaster of the Final Fantasy Tactics classic, the game has two versions: the original game and the enhanced version with fully voiced dialogue, improved graphics and more. It will launch on PS5 and PS4 Sept. 30.', 'Described by one CNET colleague as ""open world QWOP,"" Baby Steps looks to be a surrealist adventure of a character with one goal: make it to the bathroom. It looks like a zany idea brought to life in Garry\'s Mod (and I meant that as a compliment). Baby Steps comes out Sept. 8. ', 'Hirogami is a beautiful-looking platformer starring protagonist Hiro, a master of origami folding themself into different forms to traverse the locations. It\'s got a unique animation look where your character moves ""on the 2\'s"", or with half the frame rate to give it the stylized look of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. Hirogami is out Sept. 3.', ""From the makers of the Blasphemous games comes the next side-scrolling action entry in the Ninja Gaiden series, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, featuring two heroes from rival clans who must team up to defeat evil. It's out July 31 on PS5 and PS4."", ""The upcoming climbing game Cairn got another trailer ahead of its release later this year. In Cairn, you climb using natural handholds, but it's more than just the ascent -- the main character, Aava, has her own personal journey to make in her ascents. Cairn comes out for PC and PS5 on Nov. 5. "", 'Over 20 different versions of the original Mortal Kombat games are coming to PS5 and PS4 later in 2025. Retro game restorers Digital Eclipse have bundled the first four Mortal Kombat games (as well as Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate) and more into the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, which will also let you challenge players online.', 'Another trailer for the remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, showed off more bosses and, curiously, a crossover with Ape Escape (capture the ape and get a robo-ape mecha to deploy?). Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out Aug. 28.', 'Nioh 3 is coming next year. The reveal trailer for the next entry in the samurai demon-killing game showed off its open-world design and a new ninja play style to complement its armored samurai fighting. The game has a PS5 demo out on Wednesday and will be released in early 2026.', ""A new game in the storied Thief franchise, Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow, is a PSVR 2-only game that follows in its predecessors' medieval stealth adventure footsteps -- except this time, players get a virtual reality hands-on perspective. Made by Vertigo Games, creators of Metro Awakening and Arizona Sunshine, Thief VR is coming later in 2025."", 'An oceanborne post-apocalypse game that looks like Waterworld by way of the wildly vibrant Sunset Overdrive, Tides of Tomorrow has another feature that could distinguish it from the crowd: a multiplayer story. Though its exact processes are hard to tell from the trailer, players can follow their friend or favorite streamer to see how their choices shape the collective story of the game. Tides of Tomorrow comes out on Feb. 24, 2026. ', 'Have you ever wanted to sail the seas as a puppet? Sea of Remnants seems like an even more colorful and zany single-player Sea of Thieves with some interesting color and combat mechanics. The trailer showed off dragons and massive floating crab bosses whose shells are coated in gold. Also, what looks like mermaid bosses? Sea of Remnants is coming in 2026.', ""Yes, Sony debuted a third sea-themed game at State of Play -- or rather, one mixing seas and deserts from game makers versed in both. Sword of the Sea is a new indie adventure game from Giant Squid, creators of the iconic games Journey, Abzu and The Pathless. And yes, we're getting another soundtrack from Austin Wintory.

The show is expected to run about 40 minutes, Sony said in a post on the PlayStation Blog.', 'Sony’s most recent State of Play aired in February, and featured games like Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. June’s State of Play could give us some updates on other titles revealed at that show, including Housemarque’s Saros, and upcoming titles like Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Marathon, and Ghost of Yōtei.', 'Of course, we’re still starved for information on Insomniac Games’ Wolverine, Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and Haven Studios’ Fairgames, so they’re possible candidates too.

Missed Sony's State of Play? Catch the Big Game Reveals With These 10 Top Trailers,https://www.pcmag.com/news/missed-sonys-state-of-play-catch-the-big-game-reveals-with-these-10-top,"['To save you time, I watched all the promotional videos to rank the most impressive titles from the PlayStation 5 game showcase.', '', ""Sony's State of Play showcase featured many exciting announcements ahead of IGN Live and Summer Games Fest. The most surprising reveal? Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, an impressive fighting game by Arc System Works, the developer behind the renowned Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear series."", ""However, many other titles—new and previously revealed—received trailer love, too. Some were admittedly a little flat, like Ghost of Yotei's teaser for a teaser. Still, if you missed the reveals, take a gander at the 10 most impressive game trailers from State of Play 2025, which I rank based on my elation, from most to least hype."", ""Sony saved the best reveal for last and rocked the fighting game world with this unexpected announcement. Not only is the newest Marvel fighting game not being developed by Capcom (Arc System Works is developing it), but it also shakes up the formula by introducing four-versus-four tag-team matches. I am thrilled to see Arc System Works working on this project, but what does this mean for a new Marvel vs. Capcom? We'll have to wait and see. Evo is just around the corner, after all."", ""Of all the Souls-style games, the Nioh series is by far my favorite, owing to its excellent combat and fantastic Japanese fantasy setting. Wrecking magical yokai in feudal Japan with tight stance-switching combos is a peak experience. Nioh 3 is set within the same tumultuous Sengoku-Edo period as previous games. It shakes things up by introducing elements from the more recent Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin titles, including jumping and parrying and an open-field environment. The action RPG has an alpha demo that's available until June 18."", ""Silent Hill is making a comeback, delivering all the horror and tension that's been sorely missed from mainstream survival-horror games. Protagonist Shimizu Hinako's quaint Japanese town has been consumed by an evil fog, leaving her to fend for herself in the twisted, monster-haunted ruins that were once her home. I love the Japanese setting for Silent Hill F, which is a nice change of pace from the uniquely American backdrop of previous series entries. The lead character's schoolgirl aesthetic gives Silent Hill F a familiar, Fatal Frame vibe."", ""With developer NetherRealms ending support for Mortal Kombat 1, I wondered what was next for the franchise. Had the studio burned itself out? Would it take a break from the series and work on something else? I don't know, but the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection feels like an excellent stop-gap between whatever it's working on next. Developed by Digital Eclipse, this compilation delivers all the Mortal Kombat games, including the arcade-exclusive Mortal Kombat 4 and the Game Boy Advance releases. There are still unannounced titles, too, so I'm keeping an eye on this collection."", 'Snake Eater was the last of the PlayStation 2 Metal Gear Solid games, and arguably the best in the series. Its goofy sci-fi villains, political intrigue, and a touching tale of loyalty and duty made it one of the most memorable stealth-action releases. Delta is a remake that radically overhauls the visuals, while preserving the gameplay I love.', ""I love Final Fantasy Tactics. However, I admit I fell for the PSP-port, War of the Lions, which purists consider the inferior version of the game due to its frame rate issues, altered gameplay systems, and rewritten translation. The Ivalice Chronicles gives you two versions of Final Fantasy Tactics: an overhauled remaster with cleaner visuals, more intuitive interfaces, and voice acting, and a classic version, which retains the original titles' sprites and gameplay mechanics."", ""Developer Suda51's games are wonderful nuggets of eccentricity and outlandish action. I love No More Heroes, I think Killer is Dead is grossly underrated, and I even love his free-to-play Souls-style action game, Let It Die. Romeo Is a Dead Man might just take the cake on the weirdness scale. You play as Romeo Stargazer, an undead, cyber-enhanced time-cop, and hunt down dangerous space-time fugitives in this bloody, ultraviolet action game. The gaming world needs more action and more dumb humor, and this promises that in spades."", 'Not every game needs a gripping story or cutting-edge visual fidelity. Sometimes I just want to dive into a cool-looking puzzle game and have a moment of zen with good music. Lumines Arise is coming for anyone who digs that puzzle-music experience. Developed by Monstars and Enhance (of Tetris Effect fame), this gorgeous puzzle game promises 30 stimulating stages of simple yet rich puzzle action.', 'This sci-fi shooter was teased back in 2020, and State of Play finally offered real gameplay and a 2026 release window. In Pragmata, you blast your way through a space adventure. I got Bioshock vibes from the interplay between the leads, Hugh and Diana, but the aesthetics have a cool Dead Space feel.', 'IO Interactive finally revealed the long-rumored 007 game. It looks promising, though I wasn’t blown away by the footage. A James Bond game by the Hitman developers makes a lot of sense, but the trailer focuses too much on story and flashy action to sell the concept. Bond has all the finesse of a wrecking ball, which is not quite what I was expecting from an espionage/stealth game. Still, I hope the devs lean into Hitman elements.', ""For more Sony hype, check out the best PlayStation 5 games you can play right now.

"PlayStation State of Play: packed with games, but lacking real star power",https://www.topgear.com/car-news/gaming/playstation-state-play-packed-games-lacking-real-star-power,"['New Bond and old Mortal Kombat made for a serviceable showing, but nothing more', 'You might well disagree with our assessment of last night’s State of Play, the latest in a series of Sony livestreams in which upcoming games strut around to catch your eye. Whether you do or not probably depends on how much you love James Bond, samurai swords and fighting games.', 'If you do like those things, you sound pretty hard, so we’re happy to just defer to whatever you think and then buy you a new pint. Sorry. Have a good evening.', 'To us, though, it felt like a decent showing that lacked a real hype machine. There was a big new IP reveal in the form of 007 First Light, some admirable screen time given to more niche propositions like Baby Steps and Grasshopper Manufacture’s Romeo is a Dead Man, and an exciting reveal from Nioh 3.', 'Still, if you find yourself watching an extended reveal of an official PlayStation fightstick at one of these livestreams, a nagging sense emerges that this probably isn’t one for the ages.', 'No, fair enough. 007 First Light has a bit of triple-A glitz and glamour about it. And handing that franchise over to Io Interactive, the Danish studio behind the Hitman games, makes all the sense in the world.', 'It was probably the biggest moment of the show, but seeing James Bond as a young floppy haired man who might easily have walked on from an Uncharted game left us neither particularly shaken nor stirred. Maybe we’re just being harsh because of what they’ve done to Thief.', 'You’ll want to take a seat: they’ve turned it into a VR game. No disrespect to the project or the platform, but this is a seriously respected series of immersive sims from the late Nineties to early Noughties we’re talking about.', 'The 2014 reboot suffered for having been pushed through the square hole of triple-A blockbuster conventions instead of being allowed to retain its aloof, slow-burning, hardcore qualities, so watching footage of someone waggling their hands cartoonishly around the screen while they pickpocket guards and shoot water arrows into fireplaces doesn’t exactly quell the fears that might happen again. It’s like hearing your favourite band have reformed, but only to appear on The Voice.', 'Quite right, those exist too. Romeo is a Dead Man is the latest project from Grasshopper Manufacture, the legendarily idiosyncratic studio who made No More Heroes, Let it Die, and, in a supreme act of irony, No More Heroes II & III.

How was it for you? I think it was a solid showing from Sony with a nice mix of old favorites returning along with some exciting new titles. Seeing Pragmata was a really nice surprise, but we didn’t see much from Sony’s western studios aside from Ghost of Yotei. There wasn’t Wolverine or a 2D God of War spin-off like many predicted, either. Still, a solid showing, and a nice appetizer for Summer Game Fest on Friday.', 'Thanks for tuning in! Until next time, happy gaming!', 'Enjoying our live blog? 🙏 The Shortcut is a reader-supported publication with over 154,000 subscribers. You can help support our work by becoming a free or paid subscriber. Just drop your details below! ⤵️', '5:53 pm ET: Will we get one more announcement before the State of Play ends? We’re getting pretty deep dive here so I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the closer. It does look incredible, to be fair.', '5:50 pm ET: A little backstory now on Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. It’s a PlayStation Studios published game so don’t expect to see this on rival platforms. Marvel has a huge pull, we all know that, so it seems like a smart play by Sony.', '5:48 pm ET: Next up is a new Marvel fighting game by the team behind Guilty Gear. It looks gorgeous, and lets you experience 4v4 battles with all the usual suspects. Now that PS5 fight stick makes more sense… The game is called Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. It’s coming to PS5 and PC in 2026.', '5:45 pm ET: Well, hello, Ghost of Yotei. Fans of Ghost of Tsushima will have high hopes for the sequel, as the first game was – in my opinion – one of the best PS4 games. It’s even one of the best PS5 games. We’re getting a deeper look in July.', '5:44 pm ET: Interesting, 007: First Light is coming first to PS5. A timed-exclusive, then. That’s a blow for Xbox fans.', '5:43 pm ET: A look at IO’s James Bond game now. You can definitely see the Hitman influence, as expected, but it seems a lot more action-based than Agent 47’s adventures. The game also seems a lot further on than we thought. 007: First Light is out in 2026.', '5:40 pm ET: Update for the PlayStation Classics catalog. Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4 are coming on July 15. Deus Ex for PS2 is also on the way. Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 are arriving later this summer.', '5:37 pm ET: This game is giving off big Journey vibes, in all the best ways. However, you’re also kind of skate boarding around, which isn’t a bad thing either! It’s another look at Sword of the Sea and it’s out August 19, 2025. It’s heading into the PS Plus Game Catalog along with Remedy’s FBC: Firebreak on June 17, 2025.', '5:36 pm ET: Another visually impressive game here where it’s unclear as to what’s going on gameplay wise. Is it turn-based? D&D? Multiplayer? I couldn’t tell you! What I can tell you is that it’s called Sea Remnants and it’s coming in 2026.', '5:35 pm ET: Astro Bot update! We’re getting new special bots and more challenge levels. The Astro Bot DualSense controller is also coming back in stock, but with a “slight twist”. Great chance to get one again if you missed out before.', '5:34 pm ET: Not sure what to make of this one. It’s called Tides of tomorrow and is out February 24, 2026. It looks visually impressive, but it wasn’t super clear how the game plays. One to watch, though.', '5:32 pm ET: A PlayStation VR2 game now, which is always a surprise as Sony hasn’t really shown much love for its headset since it released. However, a recent price cut means more people will have picked one up. And they can look forward to Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow this year.', '5:30 pm ET: The pace has really picked up for this State of Play. A new Team Ninja game is up next and it’s Nioh 3. It’s out early 2026 and a demo is available today.', '5:28 pm ET: Another look at Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater now. And yeah, it looks phenomenal. It’s out August 28, 2025. Can’t wait for this one.', '5:27 pm ET: And what’s this? New PlayStation hardware. Sony is making a fight stick. It’s called Project Defiant, which is a codename. Looks nice, though.', '5:26 pm ET: Next up is a new game collection of classic Mortal Kombat games. It features… all of the 2D fighters? It has online support with rollback, loads of cool extras. It’s out this year.', '5:24 pm ET: Ready for some retro-side scrolling action? Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is out July 31, 2025. The updates are coming thick and fast but we have seen most of these games before.', '5:22 pm ET: I like the look of this. Hirogami is out September 3, 2025. But wait, what’s this? YES! It’s Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots. It’s coming September 5, 2025. I love this series, okay?', '5:20 pm ET: Another look at Baby Steps now. Remember this game? You basically have to take one step after the other. It’s out September 8, 2025. Probably be popular on Twitch and YouTube.', '5:20 pm ET: Oh, yes. This is going to get a few cheers online. Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is out September 30, 2025. You can play two versions of the original PlayStation classic: enhanced or a faithful recreation of the original game.', '5:18 pm ET: I’ll be real with you. I’ve never played a Digimon game. I couldn’t name a single Digimon, but the games always look pretty decent. That goes for this latest entry. It’s called Digimon Story Time Stranger. It’s out October 3, 2025.', '5:16 pm ET: There’s a strong backing from Japanese studios so far, which is bound to please PlayStation purists. Something a little different now: a new entry in the Bloodstained series. No release date for this one.', '5:14 pm ET: Here’s a game we’ve seen before, but that’s not a bad thing. Captured on PS5 Pro, we’re getting another look at Silent Hill F, which looks super creepy. I haven’t played a genuinely unsettling horror game for a while, at least one that isn’t just about jump scares. Silent Hill F is out September 25, 2025.', '5:10 pm ET: Okay, next up is Romeo is Dead Man, a game that looks sort of like Dead Rising mixed with Devil May Cry, sprinkled with… No More Heroes? Ah, okay, it’s made by Suda51. That makes sense. Either way, it’s out in 2026 – maybe.', '5:07 pm ET: Nice way to kick off the show. There will be a free single-player demo in the future. Up next is a game we haven’t seen for ages. So much so, that it was looking like vaporware. It’s Pragmata, a game that regularly ranks highly in Famitsu’s most wanted list, with many believing it was just a joke by readers. Well, here it is, at long last! Pragmata is releasing sometime in 2026.', '5:03 pm ET: Is this a new Tetris Effect? It certainly sounds like it. Oh, cool. It’s Lumines Arise. It’s out Fall 2025 and is also coming to PSVR 2.', '5:01 pm ET: Okay gamers, let’s get this show underway! I’ll do my best to bring you the biggest announcements as we go. Fingers, don’t fail me now!', '4:57pm ET: Consider this your 5 minute warning! Empty your bowels, grab a snack and a beverage, and get ready to lock in. There’s currently nearly 200,000 watching the livestream. Expect that number to skyrocket once things begin in just a few minutes.', '4:42 pm ET: In less than 30 minutes time, we’ll have a better idea of how Sony’s PS5 line up is shaping up for the rest of the year. And you know what? Even though E3 is well and truly dead, this week is doing a good job at bringing those “feels” back. After today’s State of Play, there’s Summer Game Fest tomorrow, then the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday. And yeah, the Nintendo Switch 2 launches tomorrow!', '3:45 pm ET: There’s not long to go now, folks. Soon we’ll be able to feast our eyes on a bevy of new PS5 games, many of which – you’d hope – will be enhanced for PlayStation 5 Pro. Speaking of which, the console has seen its first price drop in the US. It’s still expensive at $649.99, but with all the craziness caused by the tariffs, it could end up costing much more than that soon. Look no further than the recent Xbox price rises if you don’t believe me!', 'Anyway, it’s uncouth to mention Microsoft’s console in a PlayStation live blog, so that’s the last time I’ll do it. Unless… we see some more Xbox games coming to PlayStation 5 in today’s State of Play. Honestly, I wouldn’t rule it out.', '12:00 pm ET: Hello, and welcome to The Shortcut’s State of Play live blog! I’m going to be bringing you all the latest and greatest announcements from PlayStation today (or this evening for me), as it promises to be a jam-packed show.', 'Sony has already said it’ll be sharing updates on the latest “must-play games coming to PS5”. But what can we expect? Well, there’s a certain Marvel character named Wolverine who could do with a reintroduction, and Sony will certainly want to show more of Ghost of Yotei, which is out on October 2, 2025.', 'Sony will also want to remind people that just because another Japanese is releasing a new console for the first time in eight years (of which the name escapes me), there’s plenty of reason to pick up a PS5 or PS5 Pro and to stick with PlayStation for the foreseeable.', 'While I could sit here and speculate all day long of what Sony might reveal, the show is only a few hours away. It also hasn’t been spoilt yet, which is refreshing rarity these days.', 'So, come and join me for 40 minutes of PlayStation-centric content. The State of Play takes place at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. Be there, or be Square, Circle, Cross, Triangle! *ahem*', 'Up next: PS5 Pro gets its first price drop, as analyst warns now is the time to buy', 'Adam Vjestica is The Shortcut’s Senior Editor.
