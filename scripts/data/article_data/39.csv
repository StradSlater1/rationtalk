Missed Sony's State of Play? Catch the Big Game Reveals With These 10 Top Trailers,https://www.pcmag.com/news/missed-sonys-state-of-play-catch-the-big-game-reveals-with-these-10-top,"['To save you time, I watched all the promotional videos to rank the most impressive titles from the PlayStation 5 game showcase.', '', ""Sony's State of Play showcase featured many exciting announcements ahead of IGN Live and Summer Games Fest. The most surprising reveal? Marvel TÅkon: Fighting Souls, an impressive fighting game by Arc System Works, the developer behind the renowned Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear series."", ""However, many other titlesânew and previously revealedâreceived trailer love, too. Some were admittedly a little flat, like Ghost of Yotei's teaser for a teaser. Still, if you missed the reveals, take a gander at the 10 most impressive game trailers from State of Play 2025, which I rank based on my elation, from most to least hype."", ""Sony saved the best reveal for last and rocked the fighting game world with this unexpected announcement. Not only is the newest Marvel fighting game not being developed by Capcom (Arc System Works is developing it), but it also shakes up the formula by introducing four-versus-four tag-team matches. I am thrilled to see Arc System Works working on this project, but what does this mean for a new Marvel vs. Capcom? We'll have to wait and see. Evo is just around the corner, after all."", ""Of all the Souls-style games, the Nioh series is by far my favorite, owing to its excellent combat and fantastic Japanese fantasy setting. Wrecking magical yokai in feudal Japan with tight stance-switching combos is a peak experience. Nioh 3 is set within the same tumultuous Sengoku-Edo period as previous games. It shakes things up by introducing elements from the more recent Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin titles, including jumping and parrying and an open-field environment. The action RPG has an alpha demo that's available until June 18."", ""Silent Hill is making a comeback, delivering all the horror and tension that's been sorely missed from mainstream survival-horror games. Protagonist Shimizu Hinako's quaint Japanese town has been consumed by an evil fog, leaving her to fend for herself in the twisted, monster-haunted ruins that were once her home. I love the Japanese setting for Silent Hill F, which is a nice change of pace from the uniquely American backdrop of previous series entries. The lead character's schoolgirl aesthetic gives Silent Hill F a familiar, Fatal Frame vibe."", ""With developer NetherRealms ending support for Mortal Kombat 1, I wondered what was next for the franchise. Had the studio burned itself out? Would it take a break from the series and work on something else? I don't know, but the Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection feels like an excellent stop-gap between whatever it's working on next. Developed by Digital Eclipse, this compilation delivers all the Mortal Kombat games, including the arcade-exclusive Mortal Kombat 4 and the Game Boy Advance releases. There are still unannounced titles, too, so I'm keeping an eye on this collection."", 'Snake Eater was the last of the PlayStation 2 Metal Gear Solid games, and arguably the best in the series. Its goofy sci-fi villains, political intrigue, and a touching tale of loyalty and duty made it one of the most memorable stealth-action releases. Delta is a remake that radically overhauls the visuals, while preserving the gameplay I love.', ""I love Final Fantasy Tactics. However, I admit I fell for the PSP-port, War of the Lions, which purists consider the inferior version of the game due to its frame rate issues, altered gameplay systems, and rewritten translation. The Ivalice Chronicles gives you two versions of Final Fantasy Tactics: an overhauled remaster with cleaner visuals, more intuitive interfaces, and voice acting, and a classic version, which retains the original titles' sprites and gameplay mechanics."", ""Developer Suda51's games are wonderful nuggets of eccentricity and outlandish action. I love No More Heroes, I think Killer is Dead is grossly underrated, and I even love his free-to-play Souls-style action game, Let It Die. Romeo Is a Dead Man might just take the cake on the weirdness scale. You play as Romeo Stargazer, an undead, cyber-enhanced time-cop, and hunt down dangerous space-time fugitives in this bloody, ultraviolet action game. The gaming world needs more action and more dumb humor, and this promises that in spades."", 'Not every game needs a gripping story or cutting-edge visual fidelity. Sometimes I just want to dive into a cool-looking puzzle game and have a moment of zen with good music. Lumines Arise is coming for anyone who digs that puzzle-music experience. Developed by Monstars and Enhance (of Tetris Effect fame), this gorgeous puzzle game promises 30 stimulating stages of simple yet rich puzzle action.', 'This sci-fi shooter was teased back in 2020, and State of Play finally offered real gameplay and a 2026 release window. In Pragmata, you blast your way through a space adventure. I got Bioshock vibes from the interplay between the leads, Hugh and Diana, but the aesthetics have a cool Dead Space feel.', 'IO Interactive finally revealed the long-rumored 007 game. It looks promising, though I wasnât blown away by the footage. A James Bond game by the Hitman developers makes a lot of sense, but the trailer focuses too much on story and flashy action to sell the concept. Bond has all the finesse of a wrecking ball, which is not quite what I was expecting from an espionage/stealth game. Still, I hope the devs lean into Hitman elements.', ""For more Sony hype, check out the best PlayStation 5 games you can play right now.

"PlayStation State of Play: packed with games, but lacking real star power",https://www.topgear.com/car-news/gaming/playstation-state-play-packed-games-lacking-real-star-power,"['New Bond and old Mortal Kombat made for a serviceable showing, but nothing more', 'You might well disagree with our assessment of last nightâs State of Play, the latest in a series of Sony livestreams in which upcoming games strut around to catch your eye. Whether you do or not probably depends on how much you love James Bond, samurai swords and fighting games.', 'If you do like those things, you sound pretty hard, so weâre happy to just defer to whatever you think and then buy you a new pint. Sorry. Have a good evening.', 'To us, though, it felt like a decent showing that lacked a real hype machine. There was a big new IP reveal in the form of 007 First Light, some admirable screen time given to more niche propositions like Baby Steps and Grasshopper Manufactureâs Romeo is a Dead Man, and an exciting reveal from Nioh 3.', 'Still, if you find yourself watching an extended reveal of an official PlayStation fightstick at one of these livestreams, a nagging sense emerges that this probably isnât one for the ages.', 'No, fair enough. 007 First Light has a bit of triple-A glitz and glamour about it. And handing that franchise over to Io Interactive, the Danish studio behind the Hitman games, makes all the sense in the world.', 'It was probably the biggest moment of the show, but seeing James Bond as a young floppy haired man who might easily have walked on from an Uncharted game left us neither particularly shaken nor stirred. Maybe weâre just being harsh because of what theyâve done to Thief.', 'Youâll want to take a seat: theyâve turned it into a VR game. No disrespect to the project or the platform, but this is a seriously respected series of immersive sims from the late Nineties to early Noughties weâre talking about.', 'The 2014 reboot suffered for having been pushed through the square hole of triple-A blockbuster conventions instead of being allowed to retain its aloof, slow-burning, hardcore qualities, so watching footage of someone waggling their hands cartoonishly around the screen while they pickpocket guards and shoot water arrows into fireplaces doesnât exactly quell the fears that might happen again. Itâs like hearing your favourite band have reformed, but only to appear on The Voice.', 'Quite right, those exist too. Romeo is a Dead Man is the latest project from Grasshopper Manufacture, the legendarily idiosyncratic studio who made No More Heroes, Let it Die, and, in a supreme act of irony, No More Heroes II & III. This one sees you fighting hordes of undead, Dead Rising-style, and the combination of slick combat and a hyperactive mashup of visual influences makes it punch through the noise. It ought to be a lot of fun.', 'Capcomâs Pragmata looks like some imaginative sci-fi action with a faint whiff of Death Stranding to it. And speaking tangentially of Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid Delta will be too, and although thatâs a rather more known quantity at this point (itâs MGS3 running in Unreal Engine), itâs a nailed-on part of our gaming diet this year when it arrives on 28 August.', '', 'Get all the latest news, reviews and exclusives, direct to your inbox.', 'Glad you noticed. Nioh 3 and Ghost of Yotei provided a one-two punch of feudal era Japan swordplay, and demonstrated two distinct approaches to that time, place, and activity. The Nioh threequel will offer more ultra-demanding duels that reward deft inputs and quick reactions, while Sucker Punchâs follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima will do that, but with a bigger health bar and more narrative choices.', 'Now that weâve had a cup of tea and put the Thief VR thing behind us, yes there is. The show might have been missing that âHold on, what?â reveal moment, but its smaller beats were very pleasing.', 'Like the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, which takes an archival approach to the first four classic beat âem ups plus their various spinoffs, bundling them all into one place where theyâre super complete â sorry, Komplete â and playable on modern hardware.', 'And Silent Hill f, a horror spinoff from the famously misty mainline series, which invites you to âfind the beauty in horrorâ. At first sight this one seems to be about the worries of a girl in adolescence made manifest as gore-drenched nameless horrors with blades all over them. ', 'Um, is it ok if we have a go at finding the beauty in that while the lights are still on and we keep pausing to decompress with restomod Tiktoks? Ok, deal.', 'This is only the start of all the big announcements and trailer-spamming though, with Summer Games Fest 2025 due to start in earnest on Friday 6 June.

Weâre getting new special bots and more challenge levels. The Astro Bot DualSense controller is also coming back in stock, but with a âslight twistâ. Great chance to get one again if you missed out before.', '5:34 pm ET: Not sure what to make of this one. Itâs called Tides of tomorrow and is out February 24, 2026. It looks visually impressive, but it wasnât super clear how the game plays. One to watch, though.', '5:32 pm ET: A PlayStation VR2 game now, which is always a surprise as Sony hasnât really shown much love for its headset since it released. However, a recent price cut means more people will have picked one up. And they can look forward to Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow this year.', '5:30 pm ET: The pace has really picked up for this State of Play. A new Team Ninja game is up next and itâs Nioh 3. Itâs out early 2026 and a demo is available today.', '5:28 pm ET: Another look at Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater now. And yeah, it looks phenomenal. Itâs out August 28, 2025. Canât wait for this one.', '5:27 pm ET: And whatâs this? New PlayStation hardware. Sony is making a fight stick. Itâs called Project Defiant, which is a codename. Looks nice, though.', '5:26 pm ET: Next up is a new game collection of classic Mortal Kombat games. It featuresâ¦ all of the 2D fighters? It has online support with rollback, loads of cool extras. Itâs out this year.', '5:24 pm ET: Ready for some retro-side scrolling action? Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is out July 31, 2025. The updates are coming thick and fast but we have seen most of these games before.', '5:22 pm ET: I like the look of this. Hirogami is out September 3, 2025. But wait, whatâs this? YES! Itâs Everybodyâs Golf Hot Shots. Itâs coming September 5, 2025. I love this series, okay?', '5:20 pm ET: Another look at Baby Steps now. Remember this game? You basically have to take one step after the other. Itâs out September 8, 2025. Probably be popular on Twitch and YouTube.', '5:20 pm ET: Oh, yes. This is going to get a few cheers online. Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is out September 30, 2025. You can play two versions of the original PlayStation classic: enhanced or a faithful recreation of the original game.', '5:18 pm ET: Iâll be real with you. Iâve never played a Digimon game. I couldnât name a single Digimon, but the games always look pretty decent. That goes for this latest entry. Itâs called Digimon Story Time Stranger. Itâs out October 3, 2025.', '5:16 pm ET: Thereâs a strong backing from Japanese studios so far, which is bound to please PlayStation purists. Something a little different now: a new entry in the Bloodstained series. No release date for this one.', '5:14 pm ET: Hereâs a game weâve seen before, but thatâs not a bad thing. Captured on PS5 Pro, weâre getting another look at Silent Hill F, which looks super creepy. I havenât played a genuinely unsettling horror game for a while, at least one that isnât just about jump scares. Silent Hill F is out September 25, 2025.', '5:10 pm ET: Okay, next up is Romeo is Dead Man, a game that looks sort of like Dead Rising mixed with Devil May Cry, sprinkled withâ¦ No More Heroes? Ah, okay, itâs made by Suda51. That makes sense. Either way, itâs out in 2026 â maybe.', '5:07 pm ET: Nice way to kick off the show. There will be a free single-player demo in the future. Up next is a game we havenât seen for ages. So much so, that it was looking like vaporware. Itâs Pragmata, a game that regularly ranks highly in Famitsuâs most wanted list, with many believing it was just a joke by readers. Well, here it is, at long last! Pragmata is releasing sometime in 2026.', '5:03 pm ET: Is this a new Tetris Effect? It certainly sounds like it. Oh, cool. Itâs Lumines Arise. Itâs out Fall 2025 and is also coming to PSVR 2.', '5:01 pm ET: Okay gamers, letâs get this show underway! Iâll do my best to bring you the biggest announcements as we go. Fingers, donât fail me now!', '4:57pm ET: Consider this your 5 minute warning! Empty your bowels, grab a snack and a beverage, and get ready to lock in. Thereâs currently nearly 200,000 watching the livestream. Expect that number to skyrocket once things begin in just a few minutes.', '4:42 pm ET: In less than 30 minutes time, weâll have a better idea of how Sonyâs PS5 line up is shaping up for the rest of the year. And you know what? Even though E3 is well and truly dead, this week is doing a good job at bringing those âfeelsâ back. After todayâs State of Play, thereâs Summer Game Fest tomorrow, then the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday. And yeah, the Nintendo Switch 2 launches tomorrow!', '3:45 pm ET: Thereâs not long to go now, folks. Soon weâll be able to feast our eyes on a bevy of new PS5 games, many of which â youâd hope â will be enhanced for PlayStation 5 Pro. Speaking of which, the console has seen its first price drop in the US. Itâs still expensive at $649.99, but with all the craziness caused by the tariffs, it could end up costing much more than that soon. Look no further than the recent Xbox price rises if you donât believe me!', 'Anyway, itâs uncouth to mention Microsoftâs console in a PlayStation live blog, so thatâs the last time Iâll do it. Unlessâ¦ we see some more Xbox games coming to PlayStation 5 in todayâs State of Play. Honestly, I wouldnât rule it out.', '12:00 pm ET: Hello, and welcome to The Shortcutâs State of Play live blog! Iâm going to be bringing you all the latest and greatest announcements from PlayStation today (or this evening for me), as it promises to be a jam-packed show.', 'Sony has already said itâll be sharing updates on the latest âmust-play games coming to PS5â. But what can we expect? Well, thereâs a certain Marvel character named Wolverine who could do with a reintroduction, and Sony will certainly want to show more of Ghost of Yotei, which is out on October 2, 2025.', 'Sony will also want to remind people that just because another Japanese is releasing a new console for the first time in eight years (of which the name escapes me), thereâs plenty of reason to pick up a PS5 or PS5 Pro and to stick with PlayStation for the foreseeable.', 'While I could sit here and speculate all day long of what Sony might reveal, the show is only a few hours away. It also hasnât been spoilt yet, which is refreshing rarity these days.', 'So, come and join me for 40 minutes of PlayStation-centric content. The State of Play takes place at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. Be there, or be Square, Circle, Cross, Triangle! *ahem*', 'Up next: PS5 Pro gets its first price drop, as analyst warns now is the time to buy', 'Adam Vjestica is The Shortcutâs Senior Editor.
