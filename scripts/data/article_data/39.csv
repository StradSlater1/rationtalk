Cole Escola Looked Like a Disney Princess at the Tony Awards,https://www.allure.com/story/cole-escola-2025-tony-awards-beauty-look,"['The 2025 Tony Awards did not disappoint. The performances? Phenomenal. The acceptance speeches? Moving. And the looks! Host Cynthia Erivo alone served up enough glamour to keep us fully locked in, as expected, but plenty of nominees and presenters provided beauty and fashion triumphs that could inspire their own Broadway-style musical medley. And perhaps the most memorable look of the night was that of Cole Escola.', ""The beloved actor and writer was nominated as both the author of Oh, Mary! and best actor, the latter of which they won, launching a standing ovation at both Radio City Music Hall and at Tony-watching homes around the world. (Well, that happened where I was watching with my grown-up-theatre-kid friends—I can't speak for everyone else.) And if you missed the red carpet, this much-deserved win gave you a fantastic opportunity to see Escola's amazing ensemble."", ""The entire vibe of the look, at first glance, was very Disney princess—the silvery-blue Cinderella-like hue of the off-the-shoulder gown, the prom-perfect curly updo, the sparkling eyes. But it's actually a theatre deep cut: They were inspired by the look Bernadette Peters wore to accept her Tony for Annie Get Your Gun in 1999."", ""The auburn tendrils are practically a carbon copy of Peters's hairstyle, and the dress, while not an exact recreation, very intentionally recalls her gown. “Cole wears a version of our classic lace-up ‘Wasp’ corset in pale blue taffeta, with draping at the chest and hips, fully hand-embroidered with metallic blue glass beads,” designer Jackson Wiederhoeft said in a statement. “The skirt is embroidered in the same glass beads, and an ornamental door motif cascades down the entire front of the look in silver glass beads, faceted crystals, and tarnished metal sequins — a nod to Bernadette's medals and the significance of the passage of time.”"", ""The color and crystals extended to Escola's manicure—perhaps the most modern twist on the homage. The base of each nail was painted in a blue shade that matched their dress, and they were completely covered in crystals and topped off with a crystal bow at the cuticle."", ""Escola's win is well-deserved, and so is the praise their glam squad gets on this stunning tribute to a Broadway icon—something Escola can call themselves now."", 'More celebrity beauty news:', 'Now watch Nicole Kidman break down her most iconic looks:', 'Follow Allure on Instagram and TikTok, or subscribe to our newsletter to stay up to date on all things beauty.', 'MORE FROM ALLURE THE BEAUTY EXPERT', 'CONTACT', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

Poor Mary has reason to be in a state of spiraling turmoil. Husband Abraham Lincoln (Conrad Ricamora), wary of Mary’s scandalous behavior, has placed her booze under lock and key.', 'The Civil War, which is jeopardizing his presidency, has turned him into an utter killjoy. Overcome with stress, he’s finding it harder than ever to resist his homosexual urges. He prays for willpower, but his assistant (Tony Macht) is all too willing to go above and beyond the call of duty.', 'The production, directed by Sam Pinkleton, plays this delirious situation to the comic hilt. Melodramatic tropes, from the striking of over-the-top poses to thunderous piano underscoring during moments of rising tension, situate “Oh, Mary!” in a bygone theatrical universe.', 'Escola’s Mary, dressed like a 19th century version of Wednesday Addams from “The Addams Family,” can’t contain herself. Don’t let the rouged cheeks and Shirley Temple curls fool you. That demonic glint in her eye isn’t a ruse.', 'Escola is part of a wave of comics, along with Megan Stalter, who built their fan bases by posting comic vignettes on social media during the pandemic. Both were crucial mental health resources during that dark time, and both found a wider embrace online for their niche comic sensibilities.', '“Oh, Mary!,” which had its premiere off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre last year, has become the mascot production of the Broadway season. It’s the unexpected hit that proves that, while there are no sure bets anymore on Broadway, success is more likely when artists are allowed the courage of their crackpot convictions.', 'I’m elated for “Oh, Mary!,” but I think it would be a mistake to reward the show’s giddy Broadway triumph with the Tony for best play. The category is too rich to be treated as a popularity contest this year. Artistic discernment is called for when deciding among works as good as these.', 'The race includes two plays that received the Pulitzer Prize, the 2023 winner, Sanaz Toossi’s “English” and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ newly awarded “Purpose.” Jez Butterworth, who won the 2019 Tony for his play “The Ferryman,” has outdone himself with “The Hills of California,” the fall season’s best (and most intricately woven) drama, magisterially directed by Sam Mendes. And “John Proctor Is the Villain,” Kimberly Belflower’s reconsideration of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible,” thrillingly staged by Danya Taymor, is perhaps the feat of playwriting that surprised me most in this group.', '“Oh, Mary!” ought to receive a special citation. Not only is it in a category of its own, but it doesn’t bear comparison with the other nominees. And this point of view has nothing to do with any bias against camp. In fact, it’s my deep affection for the genre that has compelled me to raise what I assume will be an unpopular opinion.', 'In her landmark 1964 essay “Notes on ‘Camp’,” Susan Sontag observed that the “whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to ‘the serious.’ One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.”', 'The silliness of “Oh, Mary!” shouldn’t be held against it. Artistic worthiness isn’t measured by gravity of subject matter. But there’s something mainstream about Escola’s outrageous flamboyance — it’s camp for “The Carol Burnett Show” crowd.', 'Sontag noted that camp functions as “a private code, a badge of identity even.” I wasn’t sure who “Oh, Mary!” was pitched to, but it didn’t seem intended for someone whose camp sensibility was forged watching the plays of Charles Ludlam at the Ridiculous Theatrical Company in Greenwich Village or the drag headliners of East Village bars and clubs that made such an impression on me in the 1980s and 1990s.', 'That was a bleak period to be coming of age in New York. The AIDS crisis left the gay community in a state of mournful siege. Camp offered sanctuary, a mode of performance that didn’t suffer hypocritical fools gladly. There was something transgressive and liberating about an aesthetic that inverted not only good and bad taste but also conventional and unconventional morality.', '“Oh, Mary!” is fearlessly raunchy but never is it truly dangerous. The show is both a novelty on Broadway and completely at home there. The audience members laughing the hardest on a recent visit to the Lyceum Theatre were the older married couples who found it risqué enough to enjoy but not so risqué that it might upend their thinking of right and wrong.', 'As a spoof of melodrama, it is sprightly, crisply executed and untaxingly entertaining. Part of the appeal of “Oh, Mary!” is that it just wants to give audiences a concentrated dose of hilarity. Escola recognizes the importance of not being earnest. But the mainstream success the show is enjoying is a sign of something more subversive being watered down.', 'The Tony nominating committee has demonstrated remarkable judgment this year. Let’s hope Tony voters follow suit and give one of the other four best play nominees the award. If forced to pick a winner, I would opt for “Purpose,” Jacobs-Jenkins’ engrossing family drama set in the household of a civil rights icon, whose personal and public morality haven’t always been aligned.', 'Any concise description of “Purpose” is bound to fail because the play is so multifarious and complex. Jacobs-Jenkins has written a domestic drama in the epic tradition of “Death of a Salesman,” “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and “August: Osage County.”', 'The playwright has pursued this line before in “Appropriate,” which won the Tony for best revival last year. But here the focus is on a Black family grappling both with the burdens and privileges of a father’s unique legacy and the difficulty of adapting to changing times and new frontiers of political struggle.', 'Whenever you think you know which way “Purpose” is heading, it veers off in an unexpected direction. The play leaves the mundane world to engage in spiritual questions between an old-school father (Harry Lennix) and his independent-minded youngest son, Nazareth (Jon Michael Hill), who left divinity school to become a nature photographer.', '“Naz,” as he’s known, serves as the play’s narrator. And as someone who identifies as asexual and is possibly on the spectrum, he brings a bracingly original perspective to the classic homecoming play, updating the genre for the 21st century.', '“Purpose” deserves an extensive life after Broadway, and a Tony would help its producing prospects. The Steppenwolf Theatre production at the Helen Hayes Theater, directed by Phylicia Rashad and featuring one of the best ensemble casts of the season, is intimidatingly good. (LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Lennix, Hill, Glenn Davis and Kara Young were all nominated for their work, but the company really deserves a collective award.)', 'It’s a long play (nearly three hours), and one you might not care to see performed with second-tier performers. A Tony would create more incentive for regional theaters to rise to the challenge, though with a Pulitzer, New York Drama Critics’ Award and Drama Desk Award, “Purpose” is hardly lacking in accolades.', 'There was a time not so long ago when the future of the Broadway play was in serious doubt. The threat hasn’t gone away, and Tony voters shouldn’t pass up an opportunity to honor true playwriting excellence.', 'The biggest entertainment stories', 'Get our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', '', 'Charles McNulty is the theater critic of the Los Angeles Times.

Cole Escola on Tonys Drama and Their Cinderella-Meets-Bernadette Peters Look at the Tony Awards 2025,https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/cole-escola-tony-awards-2025,"['No matter the outcome of the Tony Awards 2025 on Sunday, Cole Escola was destined for a Cinderella moment. It wasn’t enough that the playwright and star of Oh, Mary! had a sweeping powder-blue Wiederhoeft gown waiting for them Friday at their final fitting, when they burst into the designer’s atelier in New York’s Garment District about 10 minutes behind schedule, they were missing part of their shoe. Damsel, meet distress.', '“Sorry, my shoes, they just—fell apart,” Escola explained breathlessly, whipping off a pair of dark sunglasses. On the walk over, the outsole had peeled off one beige leather ballet-like flat, then the other. They were still wearing the shoes and seemed reluctant to toss them, even though they were holding the detached black rubber soles in one hand. “Of course, everything disintegrates.”', 'Actors Judi Dench, Martin Short, Bernadette Peters, and Brian Dennehy pose together with their Tony Awards on June 6, 1999.', 'All this happened before Escola had their belle-of-the-ball moment Sunday onstage in that same intricately beaded gown, which was inspired by the one Bernadette Peters wore at the 1999 Tony Awards to perform her number from Annie Get Your Gun, and then shortly thereafter to accept her best actress in a musical award for the role, having no time to change in between. Escola, dazzling in a dark auburn ringleted wig and with both shoes (Jimmy Choo, encrusted with glimmering rhinestones, including the soles) fully intact, clung to the best lead actor in a play statuette in seeming shock. Escola is the first openly nonbinary actor in Tonys history to win, and did it by playing a sauced, screeching, entirely historically inaccurate Mary Todd Lincoln, no less.', 'Escola was given the choice of which category they’d like to be considered for, neither gendered label a fit. “They asked me,” they told Vanity Fair Friday. “And I flipped a coin.”', '“Not a penny,” they rushed to add. “RIP.”', 'Escola “didn’t even think it was a possibility” they’d be nominated when the inquiry came last summer around the time of the show’s Broadway opening. But then when nominations were announced on May 1, there they were waking up without an alarm thanks to nerves. Once their name was read, right there with George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim and the rest, shock forced a system shutdown: “I went back to sleep because I was overwhelmed.”', 'When debating whether the Tonys should change the gendered categories, Escola had a few notes.', '“They should do it based on where you piss, and that’s what they should call it: Best performance by a person who uses a urinal. I sit down to pee, so I would go in that category, best performance by an actor who sits down to piss. I mean, that’s basically what they are now. Why don’t they call it that?”', 'There’s some mulling in the assembled group, which includes stylist David Moses, designer Jackson Wiederhoeft, and Escola’s friend and assistant, Ethan Fruist, about whether there should be a special Tony for those who might use a catheter.', 'The veer into catheter chat is a clear diversion: Escola says they “love surprises,” but they’re not a weeper. “I just go internal and shut down,” which is how they approached the possibility (turned reality at the ceremony Sunday) of actually winning. They hadn’t prepared a speech—and wouldn’t.', '“I just haven’t had time,” Escola said, then admitted, “And I don’t know, thinking about it makes me sick, so I think more about the dress and what I’m gonna wear. And now the dress is finished, so we gotta worry about the hair, the makeup. I really like Bernadette’s. She used to always love a coral lip, something peachy with that blue would be nice. I always love fake freckles, so I ask for fake freckles. Sun-kissed.”', 'For someone who has openly said they did “less than none” research about the real Mary Todd Lincoln for Oh, Mary!, and claimed Friday to VF that “I don’t love learning. I try not to,” their Tonys look is full of historical and personal references. There’s the sartorial and follicular nod to Peters (the final wig, created by John Novotny, scans as Peters-meets-Titanic-era-Kate Winslet), but also to Escola’s journey to Broadway and the Tonys. In the early aughts, when Escola was carving out their niche with web videos, they had a recurring bit doing an impression of Peters—one who was confident and glamorous and mugging for the audience, even when she had no idea what she was talking about. In 2009, there was Escola-as-Peters reviewing movies she hadn’t seen, and then vamping onstage as Peters a decade later while singing about “falling down outside again,” complete with sweeping hand gestures. The ongoing Peters bit maps well onto Escola’s dreams of becoming a theater legend themself, in their own mold.', 'When asked whether Peters has seen any of it, Escola says, “I hope not.” Peters has seen Oh, Mary!, however, and went backstage to meet Escola, who had joked in summer 2024 to reserve two house seats for her “for every show with a spotlight on them.” “I have a one-sided storied history with her,” they say now. Of that backstage meeting, they recall, “She was very gracious. I tried not to—I would understand if she wanted nothing to do with me, and I keep that in my mind. She just saw the show and was very kind.”', 'Escola’s gown replaces the medallions of Peters’ 1999 dress bodice with a heavily beaded silver motif inspired by embellishments on historical doors, an abstract reference to the passage of time and naiveté, Wiederhoeft said. He wanted the hand-beaded and hand-sewn corseted dress, which is the result of a team of 40–50 people, to look “very ancient, in a way. It just feels really magical, like this weird time traveling.”', '“The thing you said when we first tried it on,” Escola added, “was that it looked like it was resurrected from, like, a shipwreck.”', '“Like this has been at the bottom of the Titanic for 100 years and we’re restoring it,” Wiederhoeft agreed.', 'The group toyed with how to interpret the past through the lens of the present, the same way that Oh, Mary! does, and Hamilton and Annie Get Your Gun did (“it was the 1890s through the lens of 1990s,” Escola noted). Ultimately, Peters’s Tonys gown is reimagined through the fun house mirrors of time, gender, and detail.', 'But this isn’t a Peters obsession taken to an extreme. Or at least, it’s not just that. “The dress is really about the color,” Escola said. “I mean, of course, I worship Bernadette, but if anyone else had been wearing it, I’d still love it just as much.” Did teenaged Escola remember watching that performance and win in small-town Oregon? “I should say yes, so I’m gonna lie.” They joked that in 1999, “I was just a young 34-year-old in my dorm in my continuing education program, watching on my little 13-inch TV, and I said, ‘I gotta wear a dress like that to that exact awards show someday,’ and the rest is history.”', 'They are currently 38 years old, and they do remember watching Peters perform during the Tonys for Gypsy (2003), and “the years that Rosie O’Donnell hosted; I remember those fondly.”', 'More historical references abound in the look. They’ve reluctantly learned more about the real Mary Todd Lincoln, it seems, despite Escola’s proclamation that their favorite part of a childhood visit to Ford’s Theater, where Abraham Lincoln was fatally shot, was “this tree covered in gum” outside the historic site. With insincere apologies to the preserved bloodstained bedding across the street, they say, “That’s the Lincoln legacy: gum.” Escola wore a Georgian-era paste pendant around their neck, sourced by an ex of stylist Moses, who is an antique jewelry dealer. In the center of the ring of glimmer, underneath a stylized bejeweled bow, a black-and-white headshot of a woman in three-quarters profile gazed out: Laura Keene, the actor who was the star of Our American Cousin, the show Lincoln was watching when he was shot.', '“One of the things that happened after he was assassinated is [Keene] got, allegedly, blood on her sleeve,” they explained. As lore would have it, “She, like, cradled his head. Allegedly. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, like why would the star actress bring him water, but that’s the story. But so this sleeve is now, like, in a museum.”', 'Escola even had Coach make a pair of custom shoes ahead of attending their show in February 2025, featuring a motif shaped like the bloodstain. (“I had to email Coach and literally be like, ‘Hey, this is a picture of a blood-stained piece of fabric from Lincoln’s assassination. Can you design that?’” Moses recalled, laughing.) The team wanted to keep the Keene thread going through the Tonys, hence the prominent placement of her portrait. They considered putting the show’s namesake, Antoinette Perry, in the piece, “but I think Laura is more important.”', 'The pendant hung from a powder blue ribbon color-matched and created by Wiederhoeft, fussed over and adjusted at the fitting, and finally snipped to length with the final touch: two silvery beaded tassels, safety pinned to the ends for finishing before the show.', 'Escola sported jewel-encrusted nails for the ceremony, created by Naomi Yasuda, who also designs sets for Madonna. “I love saying that,” Moses said, holding a clear clamshell case containing several thumbnail options for optimal fit. The accessories for Escola’s look were kept minimal in number and maximal in sparkle, allowing the actor in the gown to be the main event.', 'Escola kept things brief and sly on the real hot-button questions, like the hubbub around whether Patti LuPone, whom they have been photographed with, should attend the ceremony after her statements about Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald in a recent interview prompted an open letter saying she should be banned. “I think it should be left up to the states,” Escola said. “Small government, local! ‘Run for something,’ that’s my message.” (The states, or LuPone herself, ultimately voted “no” on attending.) The other debate tearing the country apart, whether Ivy or Karen deserved the part of Marilyn Monroe in TV’s Smash—in which Escola had a one-line role (they were a coat check attendant, and recited their line Friday: “Hey, what are you doing in here?”), and the stage adaptation of which recently opened on Broadway—should also, according to Escola, be decided on the state level.', 'But there’s one thing they’re as sure of as the gratitude they will show to “Tebow from Grindr” in their acceptance speech: They aren’t going to play Mary Todd Lincoln forever. While currently doing their second spin in the role on Broadway—after taking a break and passing the hoop skirt to Betty Gilpin and then Tituss Burgess—they said, “I was always going to come back to close it, that was the plan. It just kept getting extended, and I was like, I need a break, but I’ll come back to close it. And now I’m back and it’s not closing, but I have to be done. I’m going to say goodbye to Mary.”', 'Mary Todd Lincoln, Escola said, “would love and admire and respect Bernadette Peters,” but “I think she would loathe and detest and abhor me. And I live with that every day.”', 'For now, however, the newly minted Tony winner is living the Cinderella dream with the gown to match. Before swapping out their ruined shoes at Moses’s urging, Escola looked back on how they got here—here, being both to this point in their career and to Wiederhoeft’s atelier—by comparing themselves to Carrie Bradshaw getting splashed in the opening credits of Sex and the City.', '“It’s my New York moment,” they said. “Like, I lost my shoe on my way to the fitting for my gown! And it’s Cinderella blue, my favorite blue.”', 'Gown: Custom Wiederheoft\nStyling: David Moses\nMakeup: Sasha Borax\nNails: Naomi Yasuda\nWig: John Novotny', 'See All the Fashion From the 2025 Tony Awards Red Carpet', 'Plus, the Complete List of Winners', 'An Exclusive First Look at Wicked: For Good', 'The Chaos Inside Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding', 'The 25 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now', 'Molly Gordon’s So Much More Than The Bear’s Dream Girl', 'The Dizzying Rise of MAHA Warrior Calley Means', 'From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide to the Kennedy Family', 'Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

The puzzle pieces of the universe fit perfectly together. A witch’s dusty spellbook — trapped in the highest tower of the oldest castle — flies open all on its own, turning its pages to an old incantation said to make everything okay again, if only for a few moments. With that, the die is cast, destiny is in motion and Mary Todd Lincoln gets her long-awaited Tony for her cabaret prowess.', 'Or, rather, her second Tony, as “Oh, Mary!” scribe and star Cole Escola so studiously noted as they accepted their Tony for best actor in a play at Sunday’s Tony Awards ceremony. “Julie Harris has a Tony for playing Mary Todd Lincoln,” Escola said as they started their speech, paying reverence to the stage legend’s 1972 play, “The Last of Mrs. Lincoln.” But in Escola’s relatively short time in their first starring role on Broadway, they’ve become something of a legend themself. “Oh, Mary!” is Escola’s debut on Broadway proper, after a throng of smaller (though no less hysterical) off-Broadway and independent cabaret and solo shows, and the play was a hit within minutes of its first preview’s curtain-raise in January 2024. The show imagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a hard-drinking, boisterous, wannabe cabaret star, beleaguered by her marriage to what Escola imagines is an obviously gay president. It’s not so much laugh-a-minute as it is laugh-a-second. When I saw the play during its initial off-Broadway run at Manhattan’s Lucille Lortel Theater in March 2024, the sold-out house practically shook with thunderous applause during the cast’s final bows. ', 'Writer/Star Cole Escola poses during a photo call for the Broadway comedy ""Oh, Mary!"" at The Players NYC on June 25, 2024, in New York City. (Bruce Glikas/Getty Images)', 'Escola didn’t catch up to the culture; the culture caught up to them. Their win and ongoing success are fate manifested, a testament to the power of hard work and uncompromising vision. Sometimes, the right things still happen.', '“Oh, Mary!” is the kind of instant sensation that’s all too rare these days, one so undeniable it immediately breaks through the crowd of theater savants to a wider audience of curious patrons. To longtime fans of Escola’s like myself, the show’s smash success is more of a reason to shed a tear than it is any surprise. Escola’s work has always been blissfully weird yet totally charming, hyper-confident in its discerning peculiarity. And “Oh, Mary!” is their long-gestating, brilliant brainchild, shepherded from an email Escola sent to themselves in 2009 all the way to the Tonys stage. It’s a theater of the politically absurd when every day of our waking lives is a theater of the politically absurd. But the convergence of Escola’s talents and our national nightmares wasn’t some stroke of luck. Escola didn’t catch up to the culture; the culture caught up to them. Their win and ongoing success are fate manifested, a testament to the power of hard work and uncompromising vision. Sometimes, the right things still happen.', 'Related', 'If you haven’t yet had the chance to see “Oh, Mary!” live, Escola succinctly describes the play in that 2009 email they sent themselves, as retold in their recent interview with “CBS Sunday Morning.” “What if Abraham Lincoln’s assassination wasn’t such a bad thing for Mary Todd?” the email read. But as Escola tells it, this kernel of a larger concept was too precious to let go of back then. “I loved this idea so much, I didn’t want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me,” Escola said in the interview. “To disappoint me, not just the audience, but me. There are certain ideas that you’re just like, ‘Oh, I don’t want to plant this seed, because what if it’s an ugly flower?’""', 'The fear is understandable, given the number of things that could go wrong in the process of turning one simple idea into a fully mounted Broadway production. But Escola has never been afraid of a little ugliness or a little grit. Their willingness to embrace the flawed, strange parts of life has long been part of their unique allure. Take something like “Pee Pee Manor,” their 17-minute “unaired television pilot that was too awful to air,” about a woman who moves into a cursed piece of broken-down real estate, posted directly to Escola’s YouTube channel. Like all of Escola’s work, it’s outrageous and unforgettable, showcasing a flair for character work unlike anyone else. Escola is preternaturally gifted when it comes to picking up on people’s eccentricities and molding them into a beautifully Frankensteined creation. When Donna, the short’s bouffant-styled main character, says her first line — “So eventually I just took the thing down, I said, ‘I’m sick of feedin’ humming birds, they oughta feed me for once!” — the viewer knows exactly who this woman is and what she’s all about. She’s our mother, our grandmother, our wacky aunt and the woman striking up a conversation with us in the checkout line at Kohl’s.', 'Start your day with essential news from Salon. Sign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'The same goes for Escola’s version of Mary Todd, who arrived fully formed by the time her loafers hit the stage of the Lucille Lortel for the first time. Mary is a whiskey-smuggling alcoholic and man-eating cabaret amateur, so dead bored in her marriage that she wishes her husband were dead himself. She yells, stomps her feet and raises her hoop skirt and petticoat to scandalous heights. Meanwhile, Abraham (Conrad Ricamora) has a pesky Civil War to deal with, so he leaves Mary in the care of her chaperone (Bianca Leigh) and teacher (James Scully). She loathes the former and lusts after the latter, and her heightened emotions and cabaret dreams swell to a magnificent, hysterical crescendo unlike Broadway has ever seen. In a way, “Oh, Mary!” is the anti-“Hamilton.” It’s not concerned with America’s founding principles but rather with the country’s spectacle. This is the way things have always been, which is to say: totally bananas. It’s no wonder the play hit when America’s political atmosphere feels its most ridiculous.', 'Cole Escola accepts the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play award for ""Oh, Mary!"" from Sarah Paulson and Jean Smart during The 78th Annual Tony Awards on June 08, 2025. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Tony Awards Productions)', 'Is that not the American dream, being born into one life or socioeconomic status and forging your way into whatever your picture of success looks like? Escola went from recording videos on a webcam to accepting the Tony for best actor; from imitating a legend to becoming one in their own right. ', 'It is a uniquely strange feeling to watch Escola’s success reach new, deserved heights as America falls off the deep end. I’ve been devouring Escola’s work for well over a decade, since I discovered the videos they were making online in the late 2000s, alongside their best friend, Jeffery Self. As scrappy, floppy-haired creators in YouTube’s nascent days, Self and Escola made short, terribly smart and timely videos under the moniker VGL Gay Boys. (“Very Good Looking,” as the acronym stands.) The videos’ modest success among the gay community landed the two a short-lived sketch show on Logo, “Jeffery and Cole Casserole.” Think of it like a proof-of-concept for something like “Broad City,” another show about two New York millennials that similarly went from web series to television — only “Jeffrey and Cole Casserole” had a much shorter lifespan. ', 'Things were far more hopeful back then. How could they not be? Barack Obama was pulling ahead in polling, and the cultural tides were starting to turn in favor of the late aughts’ flavor of liberalism. Don’t Ask Don’t Tell was on its way out and gay marriage was on the horizon! A new artist by the name of Lady Gaga was bursting onto the scene! “The Dark Knight” was making superhero movies cool again! It was a formative time for the newly out-of-the-closet, 14-year-old me, who recognized my sick and stupid sense of humor in Escola and Self’s videos. ', 'Perhaps my favorite of them all was a video called “VGL Gay Boys with Bernadette Peters,” the first selection of what would become an ongoing, go-to impression for Escola, who donned a curly, red wig and squeaky voice to parody the Broadway legend. The premise of the video is simple: Self and Escola were going to record a video review of the 2008 comedy “Get Smart,” but Escola insists on playing Bernadette Peters for the day. Unwilling to break character, Escola’s version of Peters has not seen the movie, so instead, the pair reviews “Home Alone 2,” which Peters can’t recall a single frame of either. The video is barely two minutes long, yet incessantly quotable, which any friend of mine for the last 17 years has learned at one point or another when they’ve been subjected to watching it.', 'Sam Pinkleton and Cole Escola at The 78th Annual Tony Awards held at Radio City Music Hall on June 08, 2025, in New York, New York. (John Nacion/Variety via Getty Images)', 'Seeing Escola on the Tonys red carpet, I couldn’t help but recall that video for the billionth time. Escola did, after all, show up to the ceremony in Bernadette Peters drag, now polished and elevated thanks to all of that Broadway box office record-shattering. Escola sported a curly updo and a gown that was an homage to the costume Peters wore accepting her Tony in 1999 for “Annie Get Your Gun.” Seeing Escola on that stage accepting their first Tony while honoring one of their formative inspirations, it struck me that this is the kind of heartening, full-circle moment we rarely witness. Is that not the American dream, being born into one life or socioeconomic status and forging your way into whatever your picture of success looks like? Escola went from recording videos on a webcam to accepting the Tony for best actor; from imitating a legend to becoming one in their own right. ', 'But for Escola, it seemed almost predestined, spoken into the universe so frequently it had to become true. Calling it a picture of the American dream would be reductive, diminishing all of the work that Escola has done to apply it to an outmoded path toward prosperity. “Oh, Mary!” might be a distinctly American show, but this is Escola’s dream, first and foremost, and it was going to come to fruition no matter what.', 'In that VGL Gay Boys “Get Smart” review video, Escola’s version of Bernadette Peters tells Self, “I haven’t seen any movie since 1999.” When Self asks why that year specifically, Escola replies, “That’s the year I won my Tony.” And at the mic, Tony in hand and dressed as Peters was in 1999, Escola took a moment to bring it back to where it all began. “To the most important people in my life, my friends, who are here tonight,” Escola said, before shouting out Self at the top of the list. And there in the audience was Self, shedding a tear for his friend, watching their dream come true.', 'Read more', 'about the latest on Broadway', 'Coleman Spilde is a senior staff culture writer and critic at Salon, specializing in film, television and music.

The puzzle pieces of the universe fit perfectly together. A witch’s dusty spellbook — trapped in the highest tower of the oldest castle — flies open all on its own, turning its pages to an old incantation said to make everything okay again, if only for a few moments. With that, the die is cast, destiny is in motion and Mary Todd Lincoln gets her long-awaited Tony for her cabaret prowess.', 'Or, rather, her second Tony, as “Oh, Mary!” scribe and star Cole Escola so studiously noted as they accepted their Tony for best actor in a play at Sunday’s Tony Awards ceremony. “Julie Harris has a Tony for playing Mary Todd Lincoln,” Escola said as they started their speech, paying reverence to the stage legend’s 1972 play, “The Last of Mrs. Lincoln.” But in Escola’s relatively short time in their first starring role on Broadway, they’ve become something of a legend themself. “Oh, Mary!” is Escola’s debut on Broadway proper, after a throng of smaller (though no less hysterical) off-Broadway and independent cabaret and solo shows, and the play was a hit within minutes of its first preview’s curtain-raise in January 2024. The show imagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a hard-drinking, boisterous, wannabe cabaret star, beleaguered by her marriage to what Escola imagines is an obviously gay president. It’s not so much laugh-a-minute as it is laugh-a-second. When I saw the play during its initial off-Broadway run at Manhattan’s Lucille Lortel Theater in March 2024, the sold-out house practically shook with thunderous applause during the cast’s final bows.
