Ohio Department of Youth Services, the high court tossed out a ruling by a federal appeals court that dismissed Marlean Ames\' claims because she failed to clear a higher bar applied to members of a majority group in order for her employment discrimination case to proceed. The justices concluded that a ""background circumstances"" requirement cannot be squared with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and sent Ames\' case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.', 'The background circumstances rule required plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence showing that their employer is ""unusual"" because it discriminates against the majority. Ames had argued that the requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman.', 'The ruling from the Supreme Court makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in 20 states and the District of Columbia that are covered by federal courts of appeals that still applied the standard.', 'Writing for the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that the Supreme Court\'s case law ""makes clear that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. ... The \'background circumstances\' rule flouts that basic principle.""', 'Jackson noted that the requirement uniformly subjects all majority-group plaintiffs to ""the same, highly specific evidentiary standard in every case.""', 'Ames sued her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, after she said she was turned down for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. She alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames accused the department of discriminating against her on the basis of sexual orientation.', 'A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services after finding that it offered ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons"" for passing Ames over for the promotion.

The ruling underscores the importance of ensuring your inclusive workplace culture emphasizes respect for all employees or else you risk being sued by many people in the majority like the plaintiff in this case, a heterosexual employee.', 'As SHRM President and Chief Executive Officer Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP, has noted, with diversity established as inevitable, creating a culture of inclusion becomes the greater — and more crucial — challenge.', 'In the case before the Supreme Court, the plaintiff, Marlean Ames, is a straight woman who said she was denied a promotion and later demoted in favor of less-qualified colleagues due to discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 over her sex\u202fand sexual orientation. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed her claim, ruling that she failed to provide “background circumstances” proving her employer discriminated against her.', 'But in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this higher evidentiary standard for members of a majority group.', '“As a textual matter, Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision draws no distinctions between majority-group plaintiffs and minority-group plaintiffs,” the court said. Instead, the court clarified, the disparate-treatment provision makes it unlawful to discriminate against any individual in employment.', 'In a statement, SHRM said, “The court’s ruling, alongside recent joint guidance from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, signals an evolution in how Title VII protections should be understood by employers and employees alike. By eliminating the need to prove ‘background circumstances’ for ‘majority’ plaintiffs, the court removes a procedural barrier, reshaping how lower courts assess discrimination claims and preventing premature dismissals.”', 'SHRM added, “For employers, this ruling carries significant implications. It reaffirms Title VII’s fundamental role in prohibiting workplace discrimination and reinforces that employment decisions cannot be based on an individual’s protected characteristics — regardless of who that employee is. This should prompt organizations to reassess how they approach employment decisions, including hiring, promotions, terminations, and other workplace actions.', '“Additionally, businesses should be diligent in maintaining proper documentation of these decisions to ensure compliance. While the long-term impact of this ruling remains uncertain, it undoubtedly challenges traditional understanding of workplace discrimination laws and may lead to an increase in litigation, particularly from plaintiffs historically considered part of the ‘majority.’ ”', '“As a result of the court’s decision, the legal construct of a ‘reverse discrimination’ claim no longer exists,” said Jonathan Segal, an attorney with Duane Morris in Philadelphia and New York City. “But the likely impact of the decision will be to accelerate what previously were referred to as reverse discrimination claims, that is, claims by individuals who are white and/or male and/or straight.”', 'Ames removes an obstacle to bringing majority-group discrimination claims in the six circuits that previously imposed a heightened burden on majority-group plaintiffs (6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and D.C.), Segal said.', 'While a rise in majority-group discrimination claims is possible following Ames, the SHRM ""Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services Workplace Impacts"" survey found that many HR professionals think it will have a minimal impact: 41% said the ruling would have a minimal impact, 27% said it would have a moderate impact, and 10% said it would have a significant impact.', 'However, more than three-quarters (77%) of surveyed HR professionals said their organizations’ workplace policies would be impacted.

Women currently represent 50.5% of the U.S. population — should they have a higher burden of proof than men to show discrimination, and if that percentage drops by 1%, should that burden be in flux?”', 'Any decision predicated on someone’s race or gender is impermissible, Braham emphasized.', 'That view is consistent with interpretations from the Trump administration and acting U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Andrea Lucas, said Julie Levinson Werner, an attorney with Lowenstein Sandler in New York City.', '“The Ames case is indicative of a larger trend in the current legal landscape around discrimination claims,” she said. “It is clear in 2025 that every employer is at risk of a discrimination claim from any employee, regardless of their specific characteristics.”', ""An organization run by AI is not a futuristic concept.

The ruling will make it easier to win such suits in some parts of the country.', 'Despite the politically divisive debate playing out over workplace diversity efforts – a fight that has been fueled by President Donald Trump – a unanimous coalition of conservative and liberal justices signed onto that decision. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a member of the court’s liberal wing, wrote the opinion for the court.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nSupreme Court backs Catholic Charities’ push to object to state taxes on religious grounds', 'The woman at the center of the suit, Marlean Ames, is challenging a requirement applied in five appeals courts that when members of a “majority” group raise discrimination claims they must demonstrate “background circumstances” to pursue their suit. A plaintiff might meet that requirement, for instance, by providing statistical evidence documenting a pattern of discrimination against members of a majority. Ames couldn’t do that and so she lost in the lower courts.', 'But Jackson said the Supreme Court’s past cases made clear that the requirements needed to bring a successful lawsuit under federal anti-discrimination law “do not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group.”', 'The “background circumstances” rule, Jackson wrote, “flouts that basic principle.”', 'Ames started working for Ohio’s state government in 2004 and steadily rose through the ranks at the Department of Youth Services.

But neither federal anti-discrimination law nor Supreme Court precedent speak to creating one set of requirements for a majority employee to file a discrimination suit and a different set for a minority employee. During oral arguments in the case in late February, it was clear Ames had widespread support from the justices.', 'Citing the “background circumstances” requirement, the Cincinnati-based 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Ohio. Federal appeals courts based in Denver, St. Louis, Chicago and Washington, DC, applied that same standard, according to court records.', 'The decision doesn’t necessarily mean that Ames – or other employees – will ultimately win their lawsuits. Rather, it wipes out a hurdle in such cases that barred some plaintiffs from demonstrating employers acted with discriminatory motive.', '“We wanted to make sure that the same laws and standards apply to everyone,” Xiao Wang, who represented Ames and who is the director of the University of Virginia School of Law Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, told CNN. “This Supreme Court ruling makes it easier for courts to root out unlawful discrimination in the workplace.”', 'Justice Clarence Thomas, a member of the court’s conservative wing, joined the majority but also wrote a separate concurrence to argue against what he described as “judge-made” doctrines. In a footnote in that opinion, Thomas slammed employers and for being “obsessed” with DEI initiatives.', '“A number of this nation’s largest and most prestigious employers have overtly discriminated against those they deem members of so-called majority groups,” Thomas wrote.', '“American employers have long been ‘obsessed’ with ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ initiatives and affirmative action plans,” he added.', '“Initiatives of this kind have often led to overt discrimination against those perceived to be in the majority,” he said.', 'Thomas’ argument was that the justification for the background circumstances requirement – that employers don’t usually discriminate against members of a majority group – is faulty.

Supreme Court rules for straight woman who claims she was subjected to reverse discrimination ,https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/06/supreme-court-rules-for-straight-woman-who-claims-she-was-subjected-to-reverse-discrimination/,"['The Supreme Court on Thursday sent the case of an Ohio woman who contends that she was the victim of reverse discrimination back to the lower courts. In a unanimous ruling by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the justices agreed that a federal appeals court in Cincinnati was wrong to impose a higher bar for the case brought by Marlean Ames to move forward than if Ames had been a member of a minority group. ', 'Ames had worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for 15 years, starting as an executive secretary in 2004 and eventually becoming a program administrator. In her 2018 performance evaluation, Ames’s new supervisor, who is gay, indicated that Ames met expectations in 10 categories and exceeded them in an 11th. ', 'The dispute began in 2019, when Ames applied for a new position within the department. Not only did she not get that job, but she was also demoted to a previous position, where her hourly salary was just over half of what she had previously been making. ', 'Ames filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that she had been the victim of employment discrimination based on her sexual orientation. The department had hired a lesbian for the position that she had sought, she contended, as well as a gay man to replace her after she was demoted. ', 'The United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit threw out Ames’s sexual orientation claim. Because Ames is straight, the court of appeals explained, her claim could not go forward unless she could show “background circumstances” to support her allegations of reverse discrimination – for example, evidence that a member of a minority group made the allegedly discriminatory decision or showing a pattern of discrimination against members of a majority group. But in this case, the court of appeals emphasized, the department officials who actually made the hiring and demotion decisions were straight, and there was no “pattern” of reverse discrimination. ', 'In a nine-page decision on Thursday, the court revived Ames’s claim and sent the case back to the lower court for another look under the proper standard. Federal employment discrimination law, Jackson explained, prohibits intentional discrimination based on “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” ', 'The Supreme Court has outlined a three-step test for discrimination claims. At the first step – the one at issue in Ames’s case – a plaintiff must produce enough evidence to support an inference that the employer intended to discriminate. This is generally, Jackson wrote, not a high bar: “A plaintiff may satisfy it simply by presenting evidence ‘that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.’” But the court of appeals in this case, Jackson continued, incorrectly added an additional requirement, directing Ames to “establish ‘background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.’” ', 'The 6th Circuit’s rule, Jackson wrote, is inconsistent with the text of the federal employment discrimination law, which bars discrimination against everyone – without distinguishing between members of a minority group and members of a majority group. “By establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’—without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group—Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.” ', 'The Supreme Court’s cases, Jackson added, also make clear that the test for showing discrimination in a case like Ames’s “does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group.” “The ‘background circumstances’ rule flouts that basic principle,” she concluded. ', 'Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion that was joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Thomas suggested that the three-step test that the court has developed to use in discrimination claims – known as the McDonnell Douglas framework – “lacks any basis in the text of” federal employment discrimination law “and has proved difficult for courts to apply.” “In a case where the parties ask us to do so,” he concluded, he “would be willing to consider” overruling it.

The first real surprise was that the rulings were unanimous. The second real surprise? Each of the court’s three liberal justices wrote one of the opinions.', 'Justice Elena Kagan, a Barack Obama appointee, wrote the opinion in Smith & Wesson v. Mexico, upholding the rights of U.S. gun manufacturers from Mexico’s attempt to sue them, blaming them for abetting cartel violence.', 'The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you. Donate now', 'Justice Sonia Sotomayor, another Obama appointee, wrote the opinion in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, defending a Catholic nonprofit from Wisconsin’s attempt to tax it.', 'Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the Joe Biden appointee, wrote the opinion in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, upholding the rights of a straight woman (Marlene Ames) who claimed her employer discriminated against her because she wasn’t gay.', 'The Supreme Court’s decision to release this trifecta of heartening rulings, each one unanimous and each one written by a different liberal justice, seems an intentional statement of solidarity, but I fear something else might be happening behind the scenes.', 'The justices don’t always see eye-to-eye, but in these cases, at least, they all agreed to uphold the plain text of the law, following the tenets of judicial originalism—or so it seems.', 'According to originalism, judges should interpret the law based on the original public meaning of the law’s text at the time it was passed. This theory conflicts with the “living Constitution” framework, where judges interpret the law based on their modern interpretation of the intentions of the original law. That looser framework led to court rulings such as Roe v. Wade, the now-overturned 1973 case in which the court claimed the Constitution protected abortion.', 'For instance, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled against the straight woman in the Ames case, applying a “background circumstances” rule that required a higher threshold for members of “majority groups” (versus minority groups) to prove that they had faced discrimination. This “background circumstances” rule wasn’t part of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurrence, noted that judges had created the rule, and Jackson’s opinion Thursday rightly struck it down.', 'Judges applying the “living Constitution” model would say that so-called reverse discrimination—where someone discriminates against a straight person for being straight at a time when most people in the society identify as straight—is a wrongful application of laws initially meant to grant more rights to minorities.', 'The court’s three liberal justices have routinely twisted the law to favor leftist causes, straining to find any excuse to uphold the claims of women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ people, or whichever leftist group is most relevant at the time.', 'Heritage Foundation Senior Legal Fellow Giancarlo Canaparo recently highlighted Jackson’s double standard when it came to participation in the political process.', 'In the case Allen v. Milligan, Jackson vociferously defended people’s right to participate in the political process. During oral arguments, she slammed the state of Alabama for failing to create an additional majority-black congressional district.', 'Yet in Libby v. Fecteau, Jackson voted against granting relief to Laurel Libby, a conservative member of the Maine House of Representatives. The Democrat majority had barred Libby from voting on any bills because she condemned a transgender policy allowing a boy to compete on a girls’ sports team. Jackson voted against granting Libby relief because she had “not asserted that there are any significant votes scheduled in the coming weeks [or] that there are any upcoming votes in which Libby’s participation would impact the outcome.”', 'In other words, Jackson seems to consider participation in the political process a fundamental right for a black group of voters but not a fundamental right for someone concerned about women’s sports. After all, this is the justice who strained to support racial preferences and refused to answer the question, “What is a woman?” during her Senate confirmation hearing.', 'While the Supreme Court issues many unanimous rulings, it is rare to see unanimous rulings on hot-button issues like guns and “reverse” discrimination.', 'Perhaps the Democrat-appointed justices truly believe that the gun companies, Catholic Charities, and Marlene Ames were in the right. Perhaps these rulings suggest those justices are finally willing to consider the law rather than use it to force their leftist preferences on us. Color me skeptical on that point.', 'I consider it far more likely that Kagan, the craftiest of the three, orchestrated this trifecta of rulings as a strategy. The next time conservatives fault Sotomayor, Jackson, or her for an ideologically skewed ruling, Kagan can point to these opinions as evidence of their “fairmindedness.”', 'Either that, or the liberal justices traded their votes in these cases in order to derail one or more of the remaining hot-button case decisions coming down the pike.', 'I celebrate these cases, but they also make me nervous.

"The Supreme Court’s rare moment of unanimity against a DEI rule, explained",https://www.vox.com/scotus/415556/supreme-court-ames-ohio-dei-ketanji-brown-jackson-unanimous,"['Ames v. Ohio was an easy case, even if it touched upon contentious issues.', 'by Ian Millhiser', 'On Thursday, the Supreme Court handed down a raft of mostly unanimous opinions, three of which reached a conservative outcome despite the fact that they were each written by Democratic justices. Sometimes, the law in a case is clear.', 'Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, authored by Biden-appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, was the first of these three cases. It involved a clearly illegal “background circumstances” rule. This rule imposes a slightly higher burden on members of majority groups — such as white people, straight people, or Christians — who allege workplace discrimination compared to members of minority groups who bring similar claims.', 'Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.', 'As Jackson writes in her opinion, this disparate treatment of majority-group plaintiffs is not allowed. She quotes the Supreme Court’s opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976), which held that the federal law governing employment discrimination prohibits “racial discrimination in private employment against whites on the same terms as racial discrimination against nonwhites.”', 'The plaintiff in Ames alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than race. Marlean Ames is a straight woman who was passed over for a promotion that was ultimately filled by a lesbian candidate. She was later demoted and replaced in her previous role by a gay man. She claims that she was discriminated against because she is straight.', 'Neither the lower courts that heard this case nor the Supreme Court, however, actually determined whether Ames is a victim of anti-straight discrimination. Instead, both the trial court and an appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, ruled against Ames because of an unusual rule applied by the 6th Circuit and a few other courts.', 'Under this rule, the plaintiff loses their case unless they can show, at a fairly early stage, “background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.” This obligation applies only to majority-group plaintiffs.', 'This rule is not consistent with federal law. In addition to quoting the McDonald opinion, Jackson also quotes the law banning workplace discrimination, which makes it illegal “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” due to factors including race, religion, sex, and more.', 'This language treats all plaintiffs exactly the same, regardless of their majority or minority status. In Jackson’s words, “by establishing the same protections for every ‘individual’ — without regard to that individual’s membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.”', 'Indeed, Ames is such a straightforward case that it is baffling that the 6th Circuit’s “background circumstances” rule, which has existed in some courts since 1981, survived as long as it did. McDonald, after all, has been the law for nearly half a century, and it was decided before any lower court embraced the “background circumstances” rule.', '', 'Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

And the court did so unanimously. And the person who wrote the unanimous opinion for the court was Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. I will now walk into the ocean.', 'What makes the whole situation even more galling to me is that it’s probably the correct decision. It’s right in terms of the law—even though the underlying facts in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services are a case study in white fragility in the modern age.', 'The plaintiff in this case is Marlean Ames, a straight white woman who worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Ames applied for a promotion, but didn’t get it. Instead, the promotion went to a man, and that man happened to be gay. That’s all I know about him from the court record, but I promise you that if the man happened to be a heterosexual white guy, this never would have reached the Supreme Court.', 'Ames claimed that hiring a gay man over her was an instance of “reverse” discrimination. She argued that the government (and remember we’re talking about the government of the state of JD Vance’s Ohio here) discriminated against her because she is straight. She filed a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits workplace discrimination.', 'Ames had every right to sue. Anybody, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation can sue under the Civil Rights Act, because anybody can be discriminated against in certain circumstances.', 'Ohio, however, is still governed by a rather archaic rule regarding workplace discrimination lawsuits. It requires people who are in the “majority” group (white people generally, or straight people in this case) to show that there are “background circumstances” at their place of work that suggest a pattern of discrimination against them. It places a “heightened burden” of evidence on members of the majority when they bring discrimination suits.', 'I think the rule makes sense. No matter what Stephen Miller or Chris Rufo tell you, white people have not been historically discriminated against in this country, and they are not now. Neither are straight people. It’s not too much to ask people in the majority to meet a heightened evidentiary standard before claiming that, all of a sudden, everybody hates them. They still can bring a claim, and win, but they should be forced to show something more than “OMG, they hired a gay man, a gay man, can you believe it? I am a victim of the gay agenda.”', 'Of course, I’m not white, and I’m not homophobic. Asking straight white people to acknowledge that they’ve had every advantage this world has to offer is not something we are allowed to do in this country. Instead, we live in a world where every time a white person doesn’t get something they think they’re entitled to, we’re supposed to assume they’ve been treated unfairly.', 'I did not expect the Supreme Court to buck the prevailing trend in this case. I predicted that this case would come down 9–0 in favor of Ames, as it has. At oral arguments, the conservatives were predictably incensed at the notion that white people should have to meet a heightened standard because of their privilege and power in this society, while the liberals were suspiciously silent.', 'In her unanimous opinion for the court, Justice Jackson analyzed the case in a conservative, textualist manner. She said (correctly) that Title VII makes no mention of special burdens or heightened standards based on one’s classification as a “majority” person. Congress could have written Title VII to include a heightened burden for white folks, but it didn’t. It could have amended Title VII to include an additional burden if it felt “reverse” discrimination claims were getting out of hand, but it hasn’t.', 'Jackson further argued (again, correctly) that the Supreme Court’s own interpretation of Title VII rejects the notion that its standards should change based on the race, gender, or sexual orientation of the litigants. Her reasoning in Ames is similar to Justice Neil Gorsuch’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, where Gorsuch ruled, over the objection of his conservative colleagues, that Title VII’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination includes a prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation.', 'If Jackson is right and the unanimous court is right and I agree that they’re right, then why am I so salty about the opinion? Well, it’s because I know what’s coming next. Reverse discrimination claims are on the march. White people, emboldened by Trump, are acting like every time a non-white person is hired or promoted for any job, anti-white discrimination is the culprit. Flooding the courts with reverse discrimination claims is literally part of the Project 2025 playbook. Straight white guys I know and am friends with have confessed that they at least wonder if anti-white discrimination played a role when they don’t get a job or a promotion. None of the white guys I know would actually sue over it (at least, they better not), but I’m not friends with a lot of white guys.', 'JEET HEER', 'AÍDA CHÁVEZ', 'JOHN NICHOLS', 'SASHA ABRAMSKY', 'The 9–0 opinion in this case is like hanging an “Open for Grievances” sign on every federal courthouse. We’re going to be inundated with this stuff, and most of these people will have nothing more than the fact that they, a white person, didn’t get what they wanted.', 'I’m not saying the liberals on the court should have considered all that while deliberating this case. I probably wouldn’t have if I were on the court. Even though I like the Ohio rule, it’s clearly at odds with the text and modern interpretation of Title VII. It would be very Republican of me to expect the justices to abandon key and obvious legal principles just to achieve a desired cultural effect.', 'But, I’m not on the court, so I still get to be pissy about this one.

Posed for a portrait, Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson look forward cool and defiantly, while the conservative appointees—Justices John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett—all look identical, because they all have President Donald Trump's face."", 'The gist is simple. That issue focused ""on what appears to many to be an existential threat to democracy,"" the magazine wrote, which is ""the far-right shift of the Supreme Court, and the conservative movement\'s plans to commandeer it.""', 'That critique has persisted for some time now. Some decisions today from the Court help show, once again, why it is neither fair nor accurate.', 'First up was Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, in which the justices reversed a lower court decision and sided with a woman who said she was the victim of reverse discrimination, ruling that members of a majority group do not have to clear a higher bar to prove such claims. The opinion, written by Jackson, was unanimous.', 'Next came Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc., et al. v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, the lawsuit brought by Mexico against gun manufacturers that the country said had contributed to an illegal flow of weapons across the border, exacerbating cartel violence. The Court concluded that the complaint did not ""plausibly allege that the defendant gun manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers\' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers,"" and thus blocked the suit. The opinion, written by Kagan, was unanimous.', 'Then there was Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc. v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, in which the Court confronted a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision that denied Catholic Charities Bureau a tax exemption available to religious organizations because the group is not ""operated primarily for religious purposes"" and serves multiple faiths, as opposed to just Catholics. The justices rejected that conclusion and said it violated the First Amendment. The opinion, written by Sotomayor, was unanimous.', 'Three remaining rulings also came down unanimously or near unanimously. That may be surprising to those who have heard over and over that the Court is hopelessly ideological and partisan. But agreement on contentious topics—or heterodox overlap in places you would not expect—is not a new phenomenon.', ""Perhaps most emblematic of that last year was the Court's decision in Fischer v. United States, in which the Court ruled 6–3 that many January 6 defendants had been improperly charged with obstruction."", '""Our commitment to equal justice and the rule of law requires the courts to faithfully apply criminal laws as written, even in periods of national crisis,"" wrote Jackson, who joined the majority. ""We recognize this intuitive fact—that there is a certain category of conduct the rule is designed to prohibit—because we recognize, albeit implicitly, that the drafters of this rule have included these particular examples for a reason. We understand that, given the preceding list of examples, this rule was adopted with a clear intent concerning its scope."" Barrett wrote the dissent.', ""There are many such examples. More recently there are the Court's rulings making clear that people Trump seeks to deport using the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to due process, a view that every one of Trump's appointees has taken. It may be more intoxicating to default to tribal lines and to picture each conservative justice as a Trumpian clone.

We have little doubt that some of these sales take place,"" she said, but the Mexican government ""has not sufficiently alleged that the gun makers not only participate in illegal gun sales but also want them to happen,"" which, she said, is what the law requires.', 'Reacting to the court\'s decision, Jonathan Lowy, president of the Global Action on Gun Violence, called the decision a ""get-out- of-court-free card"" that ""protect[s] the crime gun profits of the worst of the worst in the gun industry when they supply crooked gun dealers.""', ""And finally, in a case involving Catholic Charities, the court ruled that the state of Wisconsin violated the Constitution by refusing to give a Catholic social ministry group the same exemption as it gives to churches, so that they don't have to pay the state's unemployment tax.

Today’s decision did not change the ability or obligation to address those harms.”', 'This case came before the Supreme Court after Ms. Ames filed a lawsuit claiming her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, denied her a promotion for being a heterosexual woman.
