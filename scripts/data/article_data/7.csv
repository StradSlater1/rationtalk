We’ll go to Los Angeles after headlines.', 'In defiance of local officials, President Trump has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles after protests erupted in response to ICE conducting military-style raids in and around the city. This marks the first time since the 1960s a president has deployed the National Guard without a governor’s request.

He did not reach the distribution site and was shot.”', 'At least four people have died in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as Russia launched a major drone and missile attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city. At least 60 people were injured. Meanwhile, Russian forces are moving closer to the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy. A number of nearby villages have already fallen. This all comes days after President Trump compared Russia and Ukraine with children fighting in a park.', 'President Donald Trump: “Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other, and they’re fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don’t want to be pulled.

But instead of reuniting with his family, Kilmar was brought to a courtroom in Tennessee. On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi revealed a grand jury had indicted him for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S.', 'Abrego Garcia’s attorney criticized the government’s move.

This is an abuse of power, not justice.”', 'The chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nashville resigned in protest over the indictment. Ben Schrader had worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 15 years.', 'The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled the Trump administration’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency can have access to sensitive records held by the Social Security Administration about millions of people. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.

On Saturday, Salvadoran police arrested prominent constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya, who has publicly called Bukele a dictator. His arrest follows the recent detention of Ruth López, an anti-corruption lawyer with the organization Cristosal. Over the weekend, Cristosal warned that Anaya’s arrest marks a “disturbing escalation in the criminalization of those who defend the rule of law in El Salvador.”', 'Pope Leo has openly criticized nationalist political movements. He had made the comments on Sunday during Mass at the Vatican.', ""Pope Leo XIV: “Where there is love, there is no room for prejudice, for 'security' zones separating us from our neighbors, for the exclusionary mindset that, tragically, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms. … Let us invoke the spirit of love and peace, that he may open borders, break down walls, dispel hatred and help us to live as children of our one father who is in heaven.”"", 'The United Nations Ocean Conference has opened in the southern French city of Nice. Organizers are pushing for the ratification of the High Seas Treaty, which aims to protect 30% of the Earth’s land and sea by 2030. The treaty will only go into force after 60 countries ratify the treaty. This is Yann Laurans of WWF France.', 'Yann Laurans: “We have witnessed a lot of international conferences that eventually issue a very ambitious text, but with really no teeth. We want a text to have teeth to be able to really impose constraints and be accompanied with funding. We need funding. We need money to actually preserve the ocean. We need money to control. We need money to support the people that live out of the ocean. And that’s what we want. We’re not sure it will happen yet, so that’s why we are putting pressure on our governments.”', 'In climate news, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has revealed global carbon dioxide levels exceeded 430 parts per million last month.

He was released from custody Monday, after a brief court appearance, on a $50,000 bond.', 'Democratic officials, the union leader’s supporters and some legal experts criticized the decision to charge him as yet another instance of the Trump administration wielding the justice system to target outspoken critics. Huerta is among several officials — including a judge in Wisconsin and a New Jersey congresswoman — to face felony prosecution and the threat of prison time for alleged behavior in opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda.', '“It looks like the Justice Department wants to try and make an example out of him. Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California) told reporters, before attending Huerta’s court hearing Monday in Los Angeles. “But this is part of the Trump playbook. They selectively use the Justice Department to go after their adversaries. It’s what they do.”', 'Follow Trump’s second term', 'Charging documents made public before the proceeding described a tense standoff between protesters and agents carrying out the immigration raid Friday.

And when an officer “put his hands” on Huerta to move him, Huerta allegedly pushed back, the affidavit states.', '“What are you going to do?” Huerta shouted at the agents, according to the affidavit. “You can’t arrest all of us.”', 'Video of the incident appears to show the officer shoving Huerta, who stands with his hands on his hips near the front of the van. Huerta stumbles backward and eventually falls to the ground. Officers take him into custody.', '“Let me be clear: I don’t care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,” Bill Essayli, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, said in a post on X shortly after Huerta’s arrest.', 'On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

Bush, said that incidents like the one that ended with Huerta’s arrest left the impression that the goal of some of the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts is to engage in fights with protesters.', '“The problem here is really one of proportionality,” she said. “There was no effort at de-escalation. Good law enforcement understands that part of their job is to de-escalate, and I see none of that here.”', 'Paul Charlton, a former U.S. attorney in Arizona under Bush, said it would be unusual to see the specific conspiracy count with which Huerta was charged taken to trial as a felony — unless, Charlton added, “this administration was trying to prove a point.”', '“I would be very surprised if this wasn’t quickly turned around to a misdemeanor and resolved in that way,” he said. “It’s a resource issue, and then you have to have a charge that reflects the seriousness of the offense.”', 'No matter how the case is resolved, Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University who studies the erosion of democracies, saw a greater danger in the decision to prosecute Huerta and other administration critics in the first place — a risk that America is “sleepwalking” into what he described as a period of autocracy.', '“Americans still to this day — and I’m not talking about everyday Americans — I’m talking about politicians, CEOs, major civic leaders — they’re reading about union leaders and politicians getting arrested and they still don’t believe that it’s happening here,” Levitsky said.', 'Brianna Tucker in Washington and Molly Hennessy-Fiske in Los Angeles contributed to this report.
