Isaacman, with very close ties to Elon Musk, having purchased two space flights from SpaceX, conducting the first civilian space walk, among other things, owns a fleet of fighter jets, seemed kind of perfect for the job, went through his nomination hearings well, was well on his way to an up-vote in the Senate to become the next NASA administrator.', ""And then over the weekend, it got pulled by the White House. And the reason that's been given is that he has a history of giving to Democratic candidates over the years. I looked at the public records for that. He has indeed given to several Democratic candidates, also Republicans over the years, and he's not registered as a Democrat."", ""I'm told this information was known to the White House from day one, so it's rather mysterious why this nomination was pulled so suddenly this past weekend."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'And what do we know, Miles, about what his leadership would have meant for NASA?', 'Miles O’Brien:', ""It was a real generational shift.

The Trump administration’s request though would ramp down funding to just $600 million by 2028 before ending the program entirely.', 'According to the technical supplement for NASA’s 2026 budget request, the SLS would still be used for 2026 and 2027 missions before “an orderly phase out of the NASA SLS after Artemis III.” After the SLS is phased out, the supplement explains that “NASA will initiate a new procurement to obtain commercial transportation services to conduct later Artemis missions.”', 'Major Trump backer and record breaking donor Elon Musk seems poised to significantly benefit from this transition, due to his plurality share in commercial aerospace company SpaceX.

White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/proposed-federal-budget-would-devastate-u-s-space-science/,"['JUNE 4, 2025', '8 MIN READ', 'White House Budget Plan Would Devastate U.S. Space Science', 'Scientists are rallying to reverse ruinous proposed cuts to both NASA and the National Science Foundation', 'BY NADIA DRAKE EDITED BY LEE BILLINGS', 'Fog shrouds the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in this photograph from February 25, 2025.', 'Gregg Newton/AFP via Getty', 'Late last week the Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for fiscal year 2026 —a request that, if enacted, would be the equivalent of carpet-bombing the national scientific enterprise.', '“This is a profound, generational threat to scientific leadership in the United States,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a science advocacy group. “If implemented, it would fundamentally undermine and potentially devastate the most unique capabilities that the U.S. has built up over a half-century.”', 'The Trump administration’s proposal, which still needs to be approved by Congress, is sure to ignite fierce resistance from scientists and senators alike. Among other agencies, the budget deals staggering blows to NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which together fund the majority of U.S. research in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics and Earth science —all space-related sciences that have typically mustered hearty bipartisan support.', 'The NSF supports ground-based astronomy, including such facilities as the Nobel Prize–winning gravitational-wave detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), globe-spanning arrays of radio telescopes, and cutting-edge observatories that stretch from Hawaii to the South Pole. The agency faces a lethal 57 percent reduction to its $9-billion budget, with deep cuts to every program except those in President Trump’s priority areas, which include artificial intelligence and quantum information science. NASA, which funds space-based observatories, faces a 25 percent reduction, dropping the agency’s $24.9-billion budget to $18.8 billion. The proposal beefs up efforts to send humans to the moon and to Mars, but the agency’s Science Mission Directorate —home to Mars rovers, the Voyager interstellar probes, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Space Telescope, and much more —is looking at a nearly 50 percent reduction, with dozens of missions canceled, turned off or operating on a starvation diet.', '“It’s an end-game scenario for science at NASA,” says Joel Parriott, director of external affairs and public policy at the American Astronomical Society. “It’s not just the facilities. You’re punching a generation-size hole, maybe a multigenerational hole, in the scientific and technical workforce. You don’t just Cryovac these people and pull them out when the money comes back. People are going to move on.”', 'Adding to the chaos, on Saturday President Trump announced that billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman was no longer his pick for NASA administrator—just days before the Senate was set to confirm Isaacman’s nomination. Initial reports—which have now been disputed—explained the president’s decision as stemming from his discovery that Isaacman recently donated money to Democratic candidates. Regardless of the true reason, the decision leaves both NASA and the NSF, whose director abruptly resigned in April, with respective placeholder “acting” leaders at the top. That leadership vacuum significantly weakens the agencies’ ability to fight the proposed budget cuts and advocate for themselves. “What’s more inefficient than a rudderless agency without an empowered leadership?” Dreier asks.', 'MICHAEL L. WONG', 'LEONARD DAVID & LEE BILLINGS', 'LOUIS FRIEDMAN', 'NADIA DRAKE', 'During his second administration, President Trump has repeatedly celebrated U.S. leadership in space. When he nominated Isaacman last December, Trump noted “NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration” and looked to a future of “groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology and exploration.” More recently, while celebrating Hubble’s 35th anniversary in April, Trump called the telescope “a symbol of America’s unmatched exploratory might” and declared that NASA would “continue to lead the way in fueling the pursuit of space discovery and exploration.” The administration’s budgetary actions speak louder than Trump’s words, however. Instead of ushering in a new golden age of space exploration—or even setting up the U.S. to stay atop the podium—the president’s budget “narrows down what the cosmos is to moon and Mars and pretty much nothing else,” Dreier says. “And the cosmos is a lot bigger, and there’s a lot more to learn out there.”', 'Dreier notes that when corrected for inflation, the overall NASA budget would be the lowest it’s been since 1961. But in April of that year, the Soviet Union launched the first human into orbit, igniting a space race that swelled NASA’s budget and led to the Apollo program putting American astronauts on the moon. Today China’s rapid progress and enormous ambitions in space would make the moment ripe for a 21st-century version of this competition, with the U.S. generously funding its own efforts to maintain pole position. Instead the White House’s budget would do the exact opposite.', '“The seesaw is sort of unbalanced,” says Tony Beasley, director of the NSF-funded National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). “On the one side, we’re saying, ‘Well, China’s kicking our ass, and we need to do something about that.’ But then we’re not going to give any money to anything that might actually do that.”', 'How NASA will achieve a crewed return to the moon and send astronauts to Mars—goals that the agency now considers part of “winning the second space race”—while also maintaining its leadership in science is unclear.', '“This is Russ Vought’s budget,” Dreier says, referring to the director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an unelected bureaucrat who has been notorious for his efforts to reshape the U.S. government by weaponizing federal funding. “This isn’t even Trump’s budget. Trump’s budget would be good for space. This one undermines the president’s own claims and ambitions when it comes to space.”', 'Rumors began swirling about the demise of NASA science in April, when a leaked OMB document described some of the proposed cuts and cancellations. Those included both the beleaguered, bloated Mars Sample Return (MSR) program and the on-time, on-budget Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, the next astrophysics flagship mission.', '', '', 'The top-line numbers in the more fleshed-out proposal are consistent with that document, and MSR would still be canceled. But Roman would be granted a stay of execution: rather than being zeroed out, it would be put on life support.', '“It’s a reprieve from outright termination, but it’s still a cut for functionally no reason,” Dreier says. “In some ways, [the budget] is slightly better than I was expecting. But I had very low expectations.”', 'In the proposal, many of the deepest cuts would be made to NASA science, which would sink from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion. Earth science missions focused on carbon monitoring and climate change, as well as programs aimed at education and workforce diversity, would be effectively erased by the cuts. But a slew of high-profile planetary science projects would suffer, too, with cancellations proposed for two future Venus missions, the Juno mission that is currently surveilling Jupiter, the New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto and two Mars orbiters. (The Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan would survive, as would the flagship Europa Clipper spacecraft, which launched last October.) NASA’s international partnerships in planetary science fare poorly, too, as the budget rescinds the agency’s involvement with multiple European-led projects, including a Venus mission and Mars rover.', 'The proposal is even worse for NASA astrophysics—the study of our cosmic home—which “really takes it to the chin,” Dreier says, with a roughly $1-billion drop to just $523 million. In the president’s proposal, only three big astrophysics missions would survive: the soon-to-launch Roman and the already-operational Hubble and JWST. The rest of NASA’s active astrophysics missions, which include the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), would be severely pared back or zeroed out. Additionally, the budget would nix NASA’s contributions to large European missions, such as a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory.', '“This is the most powerful fleet of missions in the history of the study of astrophysics from space,” says John O’Meara, chief scientist at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and co-chair of a recent senior review panel that evaluated NASA’s astrophysics missions. The report found that each reviewed mission “continues to be capable of producing important, impactful science.” This fleet, O’Meara adds, is more than the sum of its parts, with much of its power emerging from synergies among multiple telescopes that study the cosmos in many different types, or wavelengths, of light.', 'By hollowing out NASA’s science to ruthlessly focus on crewed missions, the White House budget might be charitably viewed as seeking to rekindle a heroic age of spaceflight—with China’s burgeoning space program as the new archrival. But even for these supposedly high-priority initiatives, the proposed funding levels appear too anemic and meager to give the U.S. any competitive edge. For example, the budget directs about $1 billion to new technology investments to support crewed Mars missions while conservative estimates have projected that such voyages would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more.', '“It cedes U.S. leadership in space science at a time when other nations, particularly China, are increasing their ambitions,” Dreier says. “It completely flies in the face of the president’s own stated goals for American leadership in space.”', 'The NSF’s situation, which one senior space scientist predicted would be “diabolical” when the NASA numbers leaked back in April, is also unsurprisingly dire. Unlike NASA, which is focused on space science and exploration, the NSF’s programs span the sweep of scientific disciplines, meaning that even small, isolated cuts—let alone the enormous ones that the budget has proposed—can have shockingly large effects on certain research domains.', '“Across the different parts of the NSF, the programs that are upvoted are the president’s strategic initiatives, but then everything else gets hit,” Beasley says.', 'Several large-scale NSF-funded projects would escape more or less intact. Among these are the panoramic Vera C. Rubin Observatory, scheduled to unveil its first science images later this month, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope. The budget also moves the Giant Magellan Telescope, which would boast starlight-gathering mirrors totaling more than 25 meters across, into a final design phase. All three of those facilities take advantage of Chile’s pristine dark skies. Other large NSF-funded projects that would survive include the proposed Next Generation Very Large Array of radio telescopes in New Mexico and several facilities at the South Pole, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.', 'If this budget is enacted, however, NSF officials anticipate only funding a measly 7 percent of research proposals overall rather than 25 percent; the number of graduate research fellowships awarded would be cleaved in half, and postdoctoral fellowships in the physical sciences would drop to zero. NRAO’s Green Bank Observatory — home to the largest steerable single-dish radio telescope on the planet — would likely shut down. So would other, smaller observatories in Arizona and Chile. The Thirty Meter Telescope, a humongous, perennially embattled project with no clear site selection, would be canceled. And the budget proposes closing one of the two gravitational-wave detectors used by the LIGO collaboration—whose observations of colliding black holes earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics—even though both detectors need to be online for LIGO’s experiment to work. Even factoring in other operational detectors, such as Virgo in Europe and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Japan, shutting down half of LIGO would leave a gaping blind spot in humanity’s gravitational-wave view of the heavens.', '“The consequences of this budget are that key scientific priorities, on the ground and in space, will take at least a decade longer—or not be realized at all,” O’Meara says. “The universe is telling its story at all wavelengths. It doesn’t care what you build, but if you want to hear that story, you must build many things.”', 'Dreier, Parriott and others are anticipating fierce battles on Capitol Hill. And already both Democratic and Republican legislators have issued statement signaling that they won’t support the budget request as is. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, in a recent statement. And in an earlier statement, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations, cautioned that “the President’s Budget Request is simply one step in the annual budget process.”', 'The Trump administration has “thrown a huge punch here, and there will be a certain back-reaction, and we’ll end up in the middle somewhere,” Beasley says. “The mistake you can make right now is to assume that this represents finalized decisions and the future—because it doesn’t.”', 'NADIA DRAKE is a freelance science journalist who specializes in covering space science and space exploration.

NASA’s future in the balance,https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4999/1,"['At the end of last week, the space community was gearing up for more bad news. While there was no formal announcement, NASA was widely expected to release more details about its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal. The White House had released top-level details in a “skinny” budget released in early May (see “Budget cuts and the fraying of international partnerships”, The Space Review, May 12, 2025), but NASA would go into details about how the cuts in the skinny budget would be implemented: which missions and programs would be cancelled or scaled back, and which few lucky ones would be increased.', 'The release of the detailed budget would help illustrate the magnitude of the reductions to the space community as well as to members of Congress who, in the coming weeks and months will consider, or cast aside, the proposal as they craft appropriations bills. It was also shaping up to be the first major challenge for NASA incoming administrator—until it wasn’t.', 'Normally NASA budget rollouts are events. In recent years, NASA administrators have given “State of NASA” speeches the day the budget is announced, with a briefing later in the day to discuss what was in, or cut from, the proposal.', 'This year was different. There was no “State of NASA” speech, no briefing, no press release, and not even a formal advisory in advance. Instead, at about 4 pm EDT on Friday the 30th, NASA posted the documents on its website with zero fanfare.', 'Looking at the document, one can understand why NASA didn’t want to publicize it. The budget cancelled missions and programs right and left to achieve the $6 billion in cuts from the agency’s 2025 budget of about $24.9 billion.', 'Those cuts were most visible in science. According to The Planetary Society, 41 individual projects, both standalone missions and contributions to other missions, are slated for termination in the 2026 budget proposal. They range from Mars Sample Return (MSR), the multibillion-dollar program that the skinny budget already disclosed would be canceled, to many ongoing missions in extended phases whose annual budgets are in the low millions of dollars each.', '“It’s generally pretty much what we expected,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society, said in an interview shortly after the release of the budget. That was based on the overall budget reductions for science included in the skinny budget, which slashed science spending by 47% from 2025.', 'The skinny budget had listed only two missions, MSR and Landsat Next, for termination (Landsat Next, the document said, would be restructured in some way to lower its costs, with work continuing another line item.) The detailed budget showed how far-reaching the proposed cuts were,', 'Some of the missions slated for cancellation are large, like the Earth System Observatory line of missions, still largely in early phases of development. Also cancelled was the Astrophysics Probe program, also in its early phases now—NASA selected two concepts for further study last year—but which would have a full cost of about $1 billion.', 'The budget, released almost four years after NASA selected two Venus missions in its latest Discovery program competition, DAVINCI and VERITAS, would cancel them both. It would also cancel NASA’s contribution to EnVision, a European Space Agency mission to Venus launching around the same time.', 'However, small missions in development also got the axe, like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager as well as Ultraviolet Explorer missions in astrophysics. It also seeks to cancel NASA’s role in ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover mission to Mars, where NASA offered to provide thrusters for the landing platform, radioisotope heating units and a launch to replace components that Roscosmos had provided.', 'A wide range of missions already operating and in their extended phases would be terminated in the budget. The biggest of them is the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which a year ago NASA was considering budget cuts that astronomers warned were tantamount to cancellation. The new budget simply zeroes out the budget for Chandra. The Hubble Space Telescope would continue, but with some modest funding cuts.', 'The scale of those terminations surprised even Dreier. “I’d say some of the surprises were things like MAVEN, Juno, New Horizons; these really unique and arguably infrastructure-related assets,” he said. MAVEN, a Mars orbiter, is also used as a communications relay. Also terminated in the budget proposal is OSIRIS-APEX, the extension of the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission that will go to the asteroid Apophis just after its close Earth flyby in 2029.', 'He was also surprised that the budget would effectively end NASA support of plutonium-238 production needed for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and heating units. “The argument is that we no longer need a presence in the outer solar system, so we don’t need plutonium any more,” he said.', 'There was one bit of good news for science in the budget. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which leaked budget documents in April suggested would be terminated, is funded in the budget. However, it does do at a lower level than projected: $156.6 million for fiscal year 2025, versus a projected $376.5 million that NASA said last year the mission would need in 2026 as it worked towards a launch as soon as the fall of 2026.', '“NASA is actively evaluating cost-saving strategies and identifying schedule optimization opportunities to enable the mission to proceed with this reduced funding level,” the budget document said. But Dreier noted that the spacecraft is now nearly complete, with most of its overall budget already spent: “Cutting it in half and expecting to save money, that doesn’t make sense.”', 'Many of the other reductions in the NASA budget had already been telegraphed in the skinny budget: ending SLS and Orion after Artemis 3, cancelling the Gateway, potentially reducing the size of crew on the International Space Station, and slashing many space technology programs.', 'The skinny budget had hinted at new investments in Mars technology, and the budget does more than $1 billion for projects associated with human Mars exploration. That amount includes $200 million mission for “a near-term entry, descent, and landing demonstration for a human-class Mars lander” and another $200 million for commercial payload deliveries to Mars. The budget documents, though, provide few specifics about those new initiatives: the section on new Mars technology investments is less than a page.', 'The budget includes $864 million for a new “Commercial Moon to Mars (M2M) Infrastructure and Transportation Program”. That would go towards developing a commercial system to replace SLS/Orion as well as early work on “a space suit appropriate for use by astronauts on the Martian surface.” The program will also fund lunar and Martian relay satellites and be the new home of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, currently hosted by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.', 'With all those cuts come job reductions. A table tucked away in the back of the 462-page budget document notes that NASA has 17,391 civil servants in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2026, that would fall by a third, to 11,853. Some field centers would see even larger cuts: the Goddard Space Flight Center would lose nearly 50% of its civil servant workforce, while the Ames Research Center would lose nearly 40%.', 'The document, though, says little about those cuts. It makes only passing references to “workforce impacts” and “workforce reshaping efforts” without discussing how they would be implemented.', 'The budget proposal will likely face strong opposition from Congress. Some members, primarily Democrats, have criticized the budget. “This sick joke of a budget is a nonstarter,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement Monday. “Republicans need to join Democrats in fighting for the programs they once supported, and their communities thrive on.”', ""“We've heard from Republican offices that this is dead on arrival, absolutely deader than dead on arrival,” Dreier said."", 'For about 24 hours, the budget proposal appeared to be the first major challenge for NASA’s expected next administrator, Jared Isaacman. Just before the Memorial Day holiday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) filed cloture on Isaacman’s nomination, a procedural move intended to set up a vote on the nomination this week. By the end of this week, most expected Isaacman to be sworn in.', 'He would have faced strong questions about how much he supported this budget proposal, which would now be his. He had deflected questions about potential budget cuts during his confirmation process, stating that he was not involved in its development, but noted that a potential cut of neatly 50% to NASA science “does not appear to be an optimal outcome.” Did he still believe that now that he was running the agency and handed a budget with such a massive cut?', 'We won’t find out. While there had been no public issues that threatened his nomination, on Saturday afternoon Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist with some influence on the Trump Administration, posted that “Deep State operatives are trying to derail President Trump’s NASA Administrator pick” ahead of the confirmation vote, suggesting it was an effort to drive a wedge between Musk, who had lobbied for Isaacman to be nominated, and President Trump.', 'Within hours, the White House confirmed that Isaacman was out. “It’s essential that the next leader of NASA is in complete alignment with President Trump’s America First agenda and a replacement will be announced directly by President Trump soon,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement.', 'That statement, though, gave no reason for why the White House was withdrawing the nomination, and even left open the chance that Isaacman had decided to withdraw.', 'Trump provided a few more details later Saturday evening. “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,” he stated.', 'Those “prior associations” were not identified, but appear to be a reference to Isaacman’s past donations to Democratic candidates and party offices. Those donations, though, were publicly known for months, which led to speculation again that the decision was linked to fraying ties between Trump and Musk, as the latter exited his formal role in the administration just a day earlier.', 'Whatever the reason, the decision leaves NASA without a permanent leader just as it faces the steepest budget cuts in its history. That has demoralized the agency’s workforce and sent shock waves of concern through the rest of the space community.', 'Isaacman “ran into the kind of politics that is damaging our country. Republicans and Democrats supported him as the right guy at the right time for the top job at NASA, but it wasn’t enough,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), himself a former astronaut, in a post Monday. “It’s incredibly frustrating that this administration did this to him and his family but I know he’s not done yet and he has a lot left to offer space exploration and our nation.”', 'Isaacman himself took the high road in his own online comments about the withdrawal, saying the six months since Trump announced his intent to nominate Isaacman “have been enlightening and, honestly, a bit thrilling.” He added, “I’ll always be grateful for this opportunity and cheering on our President and NASA as they lead us on the greatest adventure in human history.”', 'But right now, few other people are cheering on NASA as the one-two punch of the budget cuts and withdrawn nomination create a dark mood unlike any seen at NASA outside of spaceflight tragedies. The agency’s future is at stake as it enters uncharted fiscal waters with no one at the helm.', 'Jeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

But the technical supplement to the proposed budget released Friday includes new details about how the administration would seek to reduce federal spending levels. NASA’s budget would be slashed by roughly a quarter — from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion — and would lay off nearly a third of its workforce — more than 5,500 people across its 10 staffed centers. The technical supplement said centers will use cross-mission retraining opportunities and offer buyouts to meet the staffing requests.', 'For NASA Langley, that includes a staffing cut from 1,730 people to 1,058.', 'NASA Langley spokesperson Brittny McGraw said Langley doesn’t have any additional context for how the cuts would work.', '“At this point, there are no decisions that have been made going forward about what things could look like,” McGraw said.', 'Another major shift proposed for Langley would be in its Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities. NASA currently operates 12 wind tunnels and propulsion test facilities, seven of which reside at Langley. The proposed budget would replace an 84-year-old vertical spin tunnel with a new flight dynamics research facility at Langley.', 'However, there’s a catch.

Now, Warner said that culture is in jeopardy.', '“That trickles through the economy, especially when we’re talking about this many folks laid off at NASA Langley, that has been our premier aerospace research facility in the country,” Kaine’s fellow Virginia Democrat said. “Many of those future scientists, you can make a lot more money working at a tech company, but they come and work for NASA because of the mission.

Space and Earth science missions would bear the brunt of the cutbacks, losing more than 53% of what was allocated to them in 2024.', 'If the budget is approved by Congress, opponents say, longstanding Nasa labs will close, deep-space missions, including many already under way, will be abandoned, and a new generation of exploration and discovery will never reach the launchpad.', 'Two of the most notable casualties will be the Mars sample return mission, which had been in doubt on cost grounds for a while, and the Davinci+ and Veritas projects. The latter two were announced during the Biden administration and planned for the early 2030s; they would have sent Nasa back to study Venus for the first time since 1989.', 'Advocates are highlighting the future discoveries that will not be made, as much as the loss of initiatives that were extensively planned years ago, as they ramp up their campaign to persuade Washington lawmakers to defy the president and preserve or even expand Nasa’s funding.', '“An extinction-level event is when something like an asteroid hits Earth and life that has been otherwise perfectly well-functioning, healthy ecosystems that have been balanced and functioning, are wiped out in large numbers. That’s functionally what this budget is,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, which is rallying Congress members to oppose the budget.', '“Projects that are functioning, that are on budget and on time, that are already paid for and returning good science, would be decimated. You’d see missions turned off mid-flight, extended missions put into hibernation or left to tumble in space. You’d see projects that could launch next year canceled summarily, and hundreds if not thousands of scientists and engineers and others laid off due to loss of research money and technology investments.', '“What this does is turn off the spigot of discovery, the investments we’re making now that are going to pay off in five years, 10 years, maybe 20 years, that may fundamentally reshape our understanding of our place in the cosmos, our origins.', '“Is Mars habitable for life? Is Venus? How many Earth-like planets are there? Those types of questions will not be answered because we just decided not to answer them. We’re abandoning literally decades of debate and discussion and justification.”', 'As well as the planetary missions, a significant number of other science projects that have been in the works for years face the axe. While the Trump administration proposes to slash Nasa’s overall budget, it also seeks to prioritize and grant extra funding to crewed spaceflight – particularly the first human missions to Mars, a stated focus of the president and his as-yet unconfirmed pick for Nasa administrator, the entrepreneur Jared Isaacman.', 'The advocates say a particularly acute loss to un-crewed science would be the $3.9bn Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, a successor to the James Webb and Hubble telescopes that have produced stunning images and unexpected insight into the origins of the universe.', 'If the telescope, which is nearing completion and set for launch before May 2027, is scrapped, 200,000 possible planets beyond our solar system may never be discovered, more than one billion galaxies might never be surveyed, and secrets of black holes, dark matter and dark energy may never be uncovered, the Planetary Society said.', 'Billions of dollars have already been spent on it, and killing it now would be “nuts”, astrophysicist David Spergel told Scientific American last month.', 'Other experts lament the distancing of the Trump administration from science, and believe it will allow other nations to catch or eclipse US leadership in space.', '“What’s happening now, and that’s beyond Nasa, is this general atmosphere of: ‘No, science is not important to us as much as it used to be,’” said Ehud Behar, a high-energy astrophysicist at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, and a former Nasa researcher.', '“Is the US going to be left behind? It might take time, this is not going to happen tomorrow, but China has enough people, they have enough scientists. If they are going to invest much more in science and technology development, they’re going to be more competitive, and they’re going to achieve things within five to 10 years that today maybe only Nasa can achieve.”', 'Behar also fears a “brain drain” of Nasa’s top talent.', '“There are a lot of good people in these agencies, and they’ve made a living of being innovative on a budget that was always limited. If somebody thinks that you walk into Nasa and you have boxes of dollars falling on your head, that’s not the case when you want to do a mission,” he said.', '“Even in the best years, you never had enough money to do everything you wanted. So these people are pretty well-trained to find ways with less funding to get the job done. You can count on these people as long as you hold on to them.', '“Hanging on to your best people is one of the main challenges when you have to cut the budget.”', 'Dreier said there had been “productive” conversations with congressional politicians on both sides of the aisle, and that a number of Republicans and Democrats were pushing for an increase to Nasa’s science budget in place of the cuts.', 'The argument to them, he said, is simple: why throw away so much of what has already been bought and paid for?', '“It’s just like we’re giving up and turning away. Instead of looking up, we’re turning down and inwards,” he said.', '“This is a budget of retrenchment, this is a budget of retreat.

Isaacman had broad support inside NASA, had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charity for cancer research and it was clear he was making efforts to reach out both to the private and public space community.', ""“So, I think there's just general disappointment,” Berger said. “Both for the fact that Isaacman was well liked, kind of younger, energetic, and really was coming to NASA at a time when it needed to take step forward, to modernize.”"", 'Additionally, NASA now faces a new uncertainty with the Turmp administration’s budget request – and no leader to advocate strongly for NASA.', ""Berger spoke with Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, ahead of the ninth test flight of the company's Starship spacecraft about the mission."", ""“I got the sense that he realizes that Starship is this, you know, hugely ambitious problem to solve, and that there are going to be setbacks along the way,” Berger said. “And I suspect he was hoping for more than what happened with the test flight, but at the same time, I think there's a recognition that they've still got a lot to learn and a lot of problems to solve before they really get a rapidly reusable rocket.”"", 'Just last week, SpaceX launched its mega-rocket Starship on its ninth test flight. There is some concern considering there are some fundamental issues that still need to be fixed, and NASA is counting on Starship for future moon landings.', ""“I think SpaceX is going to kind of go its own way,” Berger said. “You know, they do not need funding from NASA like they did five, 10, or 15 years ago, to survive. They're going to continue to work with NASA, but my sense is that Elon is going to be in a mode where he's ready to show the world what SpaceX can do. “"", 'NASA could face a significant budget cut—approximately 25%—under a new request from the White House, if approved by Congress.', 'If implemented, the budget would cancel about a third of NASA’s science portfolio.', 'Multiple solar system exploration missions including Juno at Jupiter, New Horizons in the Kuiper Belt, and various Earth and Mars expeditions would be discontinued.', 'Casey Dreier, the Chief of Space Policy for The Planetary Society, a science advocacy organization, anticipates that every single future science mission, as well as further development, will be canceled under this budget.', ""“And then, of course, major ramping down, ending the SLS and Orion programs, canceling the gateway Space Station, ending NASA's Education Outreach Program entirely,” Dreier said. “And then roughly, laying off about a third of NASA's remaining workforce. That's staggering.”"", 'This budget is similar to the 1961 budget, when adjusted for inflation.', ""“You have broad cuts to education, you have broad cuts to science, you have cuts to aeronautics. No one is excited about this,” Dreier said. “But again, will that be enough to be able to offset this if Congress itself broadly, and it's not because people like or dislike this budget, but the broader political trends, if they're unable to act in some coherent manner.”"", 'For the agency, this budget cut makes the process of moving forward for future missions even more of a challenge. With no permanent leader and this significant cut, NASA will have to struggle to move forward through these changes.', '“NASA will be at the mercy in the whims of the Budget Office or whomever else is creating these ideas and giving it to the space agency and saying, make it work.”']",Science,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNHdZWGxTYUZKdmVXOUJSRGRIVFJDZkF4amtCU2dLTWdZMWtvZ1N0UVU=-w280-h168-p-df

NASA's FY 2026 Budget Request has been Released,https://www.universetoday.com/articles/nasas-fy-2026-budget-request-has-been-released,"[""It's official. NASA's Fiscal Year 2026 Discretionary Budget Request (FY 2026) has been released, and the news is decidedly mixed. In a previous article, we examined the FY 2026 Budget Request (released on May 2nd) and its recommendations for the coming year. With the release of the FY 2026 Budget, what was previewed and the anxiety it caused for many have been confirmed. While the Budget bolsters funding for NASA's exploration programs for the Moon and Mars, it also contains deep cuts to many other programs and the cancellation of key elements in NASA's Moon to Mars architecture."", 'In addition to reducing NASA\'s overall funding for the coming year, the Budget calls for the cancellation of the Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion spacecraft, and the Lunar Gateway. It also contains deep cuts for environmental science, education and outreach, advanced research, and other areas deemed as ""low-priority."" Lastly, the Budget contains significant cuts to NASA\'s workforce, its information technology services, NASA Centers, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities.', '', ""The Budget is detailed in a series of documents that are available on NASA's website. These include a copy of the FY 2026 Discretionary Budget Request, a Budget Request Summary, a Technical Supplement, an Agency Fact Sheet, and Mission Fact Sheets. The priorities are spelled out clearly, with an emphasis on returning astronauts to the Moon sooner than China and beating them to Mars. Streamlining the budget is also emphasized, as is transitioning mission elements and technology to commercial space."", 'To break it down, the Budget allocates $18.8 billion to NASA for fiscal year 2026, a reduction of $6 billion (or about 25%) from last year. This includes $8,312.9 million for Human Space Exploration, an increase of $646.7 million from last year. For Space Operations, the budget for FY 2026 is $3,131.9 million, a 35% reduction from FY 2025. This includes $920 million for the International Space Station (ISS), a reduction of $320.5 million (or 35%) from last year. Space Transportation faces similar cuts, with a reduction of $452.3 million (35%) from last year. Space and Flight Support (SFS) faces even deeper cuts, with a 55% reduction ($359.3 million).', 'Only Commercial LEO Development will see a $43.9 million boost in funding (19%) compared to FY 2025. The cuts are especially deep for Space Technology, which faces a reduction of almost half (48%). This reflects the current administration\'s proposed cancellation of advanced propulsion research, which it identified as ""better suited to private sector research and development."" The same is true for Science programs, which face overall cuts of about 47%. This is spread between Earth Science (cut by 52%), Planetary Science (31%), Astrophysics (~65%), Heliophysics (46%), and Biological and Physical Sciences (62%).', 'Only the STEM Engagement program faces cancellation, with a 100% cut to its funding. This was previewed in the Discretionary Request, which characterized the program as an example of ""woke STEM programming and research that prioritizes some groups of students over others and have had minimal impact on the aerospace workforce.""', 'Of the $8.3 billion allocated to Human Space Exploration, over $7 billion is earmarked for the Artemis Program and lunar exploration. This is subdivided into $4,894.6 million for the Moon to Mars Transportation System (a 2% increase), $2,815.4 million for Moon to Mars Systems Development (a 1.5% increase), and $602.9 million for Human Exploration Requirements & Architecture (a 640% increase). The Budget also specifies that the SLS, Orion, and Gateway will be retired after the Artemis III mission.', 'Returning astronauts to the Moon and ahead of China (which plans to land the first taikonauts there in 2030) is emphasized repeatedly. Beyond this, the goal is to transition the Artemis program ""to a more sustainable, cost-effective approach to lunar exploration"" by devoting funding to ""next-generation commercial systems."" In short, NASA is being directed to discontinue work on the key systems it has been working on since 2010 (or earlier) and outsource its lunar exploration plans to commercial developers.', '', 'The Budget similarly emphasizes the need to send astronauts to Mars ahead of China. allocates $1.13 billion for Mars-related technologies that will enable crewed exploration missions in the coming decade and after. This includes $120 million to continue robotic missions and instruments that will help prepare for crewed missions, $200 million to develop a near-term entry, descent, and landing (EDL) demonstration for a crewed Mars lander, and $350 million to accelerate the development of Mars-related technologies.', 'Other allocations include $50 million to lay the groundwork for space suits tailored to the Martian environment and $80 million to accelerate development of computers, surface communications, advanced surface power generation concepts, and technology development prizes. Another $250 million is allocated for starting commercial payload deliveries and commercial partnerships with industry for human transportation systems.', ""Whereas most of these allocations continue programs that have been in progress for more than a decade, the allocation of funding for payload deliveries and human transportation systems is reminiscent of NASA's commercial programs that target the Moon. There too, the Trump administration has always preferred outsourcing capabilities to commercial partners, mainly SpaceX. This includes the contract for the Starship HLS and the launch of the Lunar Gateway's core elements, which became necessary due to Artemis' expedited timetable."", ""This latest allocation is clearly intended to advance the development of the Starship * and similar technologies. Similarly, the boost in funding for Commercial LEO Development is likely motivated by the need to construct orbital refueling capabilities, which are essential to the Starship*'s mission profiles. This includes transporting astronauts to the Moon as part of Artemis III and IV, and sending passengers and payloads to Mars."", '', 'Under the new budget, over 40 ""lower-priority"" missions will be eliminated, including the Mars Sample Return (MSR) and the Landsat Next mission. The proposed cuts to Astrophysics led to trepidation that certain advanced science missions would also be cut. Luckily, the Budget stresses that ""high-impact missions"" are safe, which includes the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the venerable Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (RST).', 'Similarly, the Dragonfly mission that will depart in 2028 to explore Saturn’s moon Titan is safe, as is the NEO Surveyor mission that will begin detecting potential hazardous asteroids and comets to Earth no earlier than 2027.', '> To achieve these objectives, the Budget would streamline the NASA workforce, information technology services, NASA Center operations, facility maintenance, and construction and environmental compliance activities. The Budget also terminates multiple unaffordable missions and reduces lower priority research, resulting in a leaner Science program that reflects a commitment to fiscal responsibility.', 'Further Reading:NASA', '', 'Matt Williams is a space journalist, science communicator, and author with several published titles and studies.

While the projected White House recommended financial reductions and face-lifting ideas for the civilian space agency are not unique – they are being viewed by many as a budgetary bombshell.', 'But first a little space history.', 'In the past, for instance, President Barack Obama’s administration made a similar move when it cancelled the NASA Constellation Program, rejecting plans to return to the Moon. In the early 1990’s US President George H. W. Bush’s sweeping and long-range Space Exploration Initiative suffered the same fate.', 'Moon first…Mars first…human treks to an asteroid. America’s space exploration agenda has been a flip-flop in space policy. Pre-empted in the process was a stick-to-it strategy.', 'But that was then.

Done away with is the Gateway lunar space station, considered by NASA as vital to support Artemis human missions to the Moon and help blueprint the first human mission to Mars and beyond.', 'Aced out in President Trump’s financial plan is the NASA-led Mars Sample Return mission, tagged in the White House budget as “grossly over budget and whose goals would be achieved by human missions to Mars.” The budget suggests refocusing NASA funding to assure “beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars.”', 'The budget being offered is one that proposes a 24.3% reduction to NASA’s top-line funding and slashing the space agency’s science budget by 47%.', 'On one hand, NASA’s budget is tiny.

Slashing it would barely influence national finances, but the outcome may well harm America's scientific prowess, advancement of high-tech via spinoff technologies, and well-earned prestige around the world for decades of space achievement."", 'Moreover, a negative upshot from the recently released budget outline is in training the nation’s future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. This troublesome trend given NASA space science budget decrease is feared loss of a generation of space scientists.', 'All this is prologue to a bottom line worth keeping in mind.', 'Human exploration, robotic science, technology development, and aeronautics supported by NASA all reinforce each other.

There’s a still to-be-determined outcome. Already there’s reaction from Congress and a reminder that the “could-be” budget is a step in a lengthy process, not final closure.', 'Prompted by the outbreak of angst by space researchers worried about NASA future budget, there’s also need to remember the quip often tied to Mark Twain, the American writer and humorist, that “the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”', 'The looming question is whether Congressional lawmakers will decree an emergency call-to-action, a crossing of a red line to push back where needed?', 'This is all uncharted territory, like space itself.', 'Leonard David is an award-winning space journalist who has been reporting on space activities for more than 55 years.
