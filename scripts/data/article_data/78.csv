Optic Neuropathy and Other Hidden Ocular Risks of GLP-1 RA Weight Loss Drugs,https://www.endocrinologyadvisor.com/features/naion-hidden-ocular-risks-of-glp-1-ra-semaglutide-weight-loss-drugs/,"['The popularization of anti-obesity drugs has affected nearly every medical specialty. With escalating use of these therapies to treat both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, there has been a greater focus on understanding their benefits as well as potential complications. ', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represent a major advancement in anti-obesity treatment, though formulations of this class of drugs continue to evolve. The first FDA approved GLP-1 RA was exenatide in 2005, a hypoglycemic agent used in the treatment of T2DM.1 In 2017, Novo Nordisk introduced semaglutide (Ozempic), a long-acting GLP-1 RA used to improve glycemic control, and later approved in 2021 under the brand name Wegovy as an injection to promote weight loss in individuals with obesity and overweight.2,3 ', 'Trends derived from patient-record data between 2011 and 2023 reveal exponential increases in prescription patterns and use of GLP-1 RAs in the United States. A 2024 study published in the British Medical Journal found that, spanning a 12-year period, 871,854 patients were cumulatively prescribed a GLP-1 RA – from 27,367 between 2011 and 2014 to 679,265 between 2019 and 2023.4 This dramatic increase in GLP-1 RA use is likely due to a number of factors. Compared to other anti-obesity drugs, GLP-1 RAs have other demonstrable benefits — such as cardioprotective and renoprotective qualities — and fewer known side effects. Furthermore, weight loss associated with GLP-1 RA use is fast and effective compared to alternatives.5 However, as with most therapies, GLP-1 RAs are not without their downsides. A growing body of research has shown that GLP-1 RAs may be associated with adverse effects in both the eyes and other distant organ systems. As the popularization of this class of pharmaceuticals continues, specialists must stay aware of the known – and unknown – risks associated with their use.', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a polypeptide secreted from the GI tract after food consumption. Following its release from enteroendocrine L cells in the ileum and colon, endogenous GLP-1 binds to GLP-1 receptors throughout the body.6 Receptors in the hypothalamus trigger satiety (i.e., to suppress appetite), whereas those in the pancreas lead to the endogenous secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. As an incretin hormone, GLP-1s reduce blood glucose levels through insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, and slowed gastric emptying.7 ', 'These mechanisms allow for GLP-1 RAs to be used as both hypoglycemic agents in the treatment of T2DM and BMI-lowering agents. The evidence supporting the use of GLP-1 RAs for achieving improved markers of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular benefits are promising and still ongoing for various formulations. ', 'As of recently, a number of studies have been published examining the impact of GLP-1 RAs on retinal health. Although some findings have been mixed, most studies recommend that physicians consider the specific drug formulations and individual patients’ clinical characteristics before starting them on GLP-1 RA therapies. Several studies show that GLP-1 RA use may have beneficial effects on retinal health and even protect against the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related ocular diseases.8,9 Additionally, clinical trials have shown that semaglutide use is associated with reductions in blood pressure, improved lipid levels, and decreased inflammation – all factors that play an important role in retinal health.1 ', 'On the contrary, a few studies have shown that GLP-1 RA use may be paradoxically associated with worsening retinal health and DR progression. Results of the SUSTAIN-6 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01720446) published in 2016 were among the first to suggest that there may be microvascular complications associated with GLP-1 RA use.10 In that study, 3297 patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to standard-care regimens or once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) injections for 104 weeks. While the rates of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke were significantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide, by the end of this study, another finding also emerged. Those taking semaglutide were found to be at a significantly greater risk of DR-related complications. Compared with a placebo, this cohort was at higher risk of developing vitreous hemorrhage, progressing to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and requiring treatments such as retinal photocoagulation and intravitreal injections.10 These findings raised concerns about the safety profiles of GLP-1 RAs, prompting a number of follow-up studies.', 'Since the SUSTAIN-6 trial, similar studies have emerged supporting an association between GLP-1 RA use and worsening retinal microvascular health. A 2024 used data from the TriNetX database to compare outcomes in 6481 patients on either GLP-1 RAs or sodium-glucose cotransporter protein-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors.11 Conversion to PDR was higher in the GLP-1 RA group at 1 and 3 years, along with high rates of DME at consistent time points up to 3 years.11 Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 randomized controlled trials with 60,077 patients showed that the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage was higher in patients with DR treated with GLP-1 RAs compared with placebo.12', 'Two large-scale population studies also suggested an increased risk of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) among individuals with T2DM using semaglutide.13,14 A case series of 9 patients published around the same time reported similar associations, however a causal relationship between the GLP-1 RA drugs and NAION has yet to be proven.15', 'Despite evidence of worsening retinopathy and ocular complications associated with GLP-1 RA use, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. A few hypotheses have resulted, with the most popular involving the concept of “early worsening” — a phenomenon well-documented in those starting on treatment with insulin.16 This theory suggests that rapid corrections of blood glucose, a well-documented effect of GLP-1 RAs, may lead to microvascular damage. Given that the most extreme drops in blood glucose typically occur within the first two months of use, physicians have trended towards starting with low doses and slowly titrating up as needed. ', 'Other hypotheses regarding mechanisms of microvascular damage include drug toxicity and unmasking pre-existing underlying retinopathy. The exact pathophysiology of GLP-1 RA-mediated microvascular damage is likely multifactorial; hence, future research should aim to elucidate the exact mechanisms at play.', 'Although studies on the safety of GLP-1 RAs have been well designed and offer meaningful insight, they should be interpreted with caution. Many of these studies have limitations that may impact their generalizability and clinical significance. While several editorials have expressed concern regarding the disproportionate reporting of retinal adverse events associated with GLP-1 RA use in specific studies, there remain a number of broad limitations. ', 'First, GLP-1 RAs are a novel hypoglycemic agent, popularized primarily within the past decade. Given their recent introduction, there is a paucity of longitudinal data or secondary endpoints for many studies. Without sufficient follow-up data, it will be difficult to answer a number of questions: are there actually beneficial or adverse longitudinal effects? Could early worsening overshadow later stabilization? Within the next decades, continuing to document observations and conduct clinical trials will be essential to determine whether there are longitudinal adverse effects.', 'Second, generalizability is limited by the patient demographics examined in many of these studies. Risk stratification for adverse effects associated with GLP-1 RAs is likely very complex and dependent on several factors, including age, DR staging at the time of initiation, existing comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and concurrent use of other hypoglycemic agents. For example, a randomized trial published in 2021 shows that patients older than 60 years of age who had a diabetes duration of 10+ years were at higher risk of DR progression specifically when using semaglutide.17 These results suggest that it may be too early to make broad, overarching generalizations about GLP-1 RA use without properly exploring the interplay between these variables and GLP-1–associated risks.', 'Last, studies have not yet quantitatively assessed retinal microvascular changes in those on GLP-1 RA therapy using imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). This limits the ability to measure objective indicators of retinal health such as areas of nonperfusion or vascular metrics such as perfusion density and vessel density. ', 'Given that most studies to date rely on clinical endpoints such as vitreous hemorrhage or the need for additional treatment such as intravitreal injections or retinal photocoagulation, subclinical changes may not be captured. Correlating quantitative metrics with clinical and patient-reported metrics will be essential to understanding the true adverse effects of GLP-1 RA use — if any.', 'The ocular safety profile of GLP-1 RAs remains uncertain until researchers can gather more robust, longitudinal, and quantifiable data. Moving forward, research investigators exploring this drug class should carefully choose and specify microvascular endpoints that can help discern the effects of GLP-1 RAs on the eye. Generally, the advantages of using these hypoglycemic therapies outweigh the potential adverse effects — especially since achieving glycemic control can prevent vision-threatening complications. ', 'However, the current body of literature suggests that ophthalmologists should still be vigilant about conducting a baseline retinal evaluation on patients prior to them starting a GLP-1 RA, as well as regularly monitoring their eyes. This applies even more to populations at higher-relative risk such as the elderly, those with pre-existing PDR or prolonged DM, individuals on multiple medications for their diabetes, and those who experience rapid reductions in either body weight or blood glucose.

The study also found that the longer subjects were treated with these medications, the greater their risk of developing wet AMD.', 'Neovascular age-related macular degeneration, commonly known as wet AMD, is the less common but more aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration, and a leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older adults in the United States.', 'The findings, published on June 5 in JAMA Ophthalmology\n, suggest that doctors and patients should be aware of the potential risks, even though the chance of developing the condition remains relatively low.', 'GLP-1 drugs, a class of blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs sold under brand names like Ozempic and Wegovy, have surged in popularity in recent years. They offer a range of substantial benefits, including weight loss, improved blood sugar levels, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk.', 'Despite these benefits, ophthalmologists say the impact of GLP-1 drugs on eye health is not well understood. Studies have identified an association between the medications and other eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).', 'While the findings don’t establish a clear causal link between GLP-1 drugs and eye disease, experts say there’s still reason for caution.', '“The dose-response effect we observed — where longer GLP-1 receptor agonist exposure was associated with higher risk — strengthens the argument that this association may reflect a true biological effect rather than being due to confounding factors,” said study co-author Andrew Mihalache, MD(C), of the Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Canada.', '“Seeing a graded relationship like this suggests that prolonged exposure could play a causal role in increasing risk. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies,” he told Healthline.', 'Drawing on health records from Ontario, Canada, researchers at the University of Toronto analyzed nearly 140,000 adults with type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible link between GLP-1 use and wet AMD. The retrospective study tracked patient outcomes over a three-year period, using data collected between 2020 and 2023.', 'Roughly one-third of participants — about 46,000 people — had been prescribed a GLP-1 drug for at least six months.

People who took GLP-1 drugs for longer experienced progressively greater risk. Those who had only taken their medication for 6–18 months actually had a slightly lower risk than those who didn’t take the medication.', 'However, at the 18–30 month mark, GLP-1 users’ risk of developing wet AMD more than doubled compared to non-users. And those taking the drugs for 30 months or longer had more than triple the risk.', '“This was definitely surprising, especially given the growing enthusiasm for GLP-1 receptor agonists for their cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. It really highlights the need for further investigation into their ocular safety profile,” first study author Reut Shor, MD, of the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada, told Healthline.', 'Despite the increase in risk, the absolute risk of developing wet AMD was still low: 0.2% among those taking a GLP-1 and 0.1% among those who didn’t.', 'Our free tip sheet highlights lifestyle habits you can adopt to help lower your risk and keep your eyes healthy.

Those findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.', 'However, other studies have provided conflicting evidence. A retrospective 2024 study evaluated nearly 700 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were taking a GLP-1 drug and found no association between GLP-1s and worsening retinopathy.', 'Also in 2024, researchers found that patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed semaglutide were at greater risk of NAION compared to those who weren’t. NAION is a condition that causes sudden blindness, typically just in one eye, due to a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve.', 'The mechanism for why GLP-1 drug use may lead to wet AMD is not well established, but a predominant theory is that lowering blood sugar rapidly leads to a lack of oxygen in the retina.', '“When you make the retina more hypoxic, which is what the GLP-1s do, it basically pushes it further over the threshold, causing more abnormal blood vessels to grow,” said Linda Lam, MD, MBA, an ophthalmologist with Keck Medicine of USC, who wasn’t involved in the research.', 'Abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye is the hallmark of wet AMD.', 'While GLP-1s offer many health benefits, eye disease risk must be considered in some populations, Lam told Healthline.', '“In this particular group of patients who are older, who are diabetics, I really would caution against the extended use of GLP-1s,” she said.', 'Lam reiterated the importance of annual eye exams for the general population, but in particular for those with diabetes, to identify and diagnose eye disease early on.', 'People with type 2 diabetes, especially those taking a GLP-1 drug, should be aware of the signs and symptoms of vision loss and consult with their doctor immediately.

In two major phase 3a trials, GLP-1 RAs were associated with a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and a .8% higher proportion of DR cases compared to placebo. Additionally, recent studies have posited that rapidly lowering blood glucose because of GLP-1 RAs may lead to a hypoxic state in the retina, promoting further abnormal angiogenesis.1', '“Given that the underlying pathogenesis of nAMD involves abnormal and excessive angiogenesis, we aimed to evaluate this hypothesis by investigating an association between systemic exposure to GLP-1 RAs and the incidence of nAMD using data from a population-based study,” Reut Shor, MD, department of ophthalmology and vision sciences, University of Toronto, and colleagues wrote.1', 'Shor and colleagues collected data on adult patients ≥66 years with diabetes from 2020-2023.

By comparison, 88 patients with no prior GLP-1 RA experience were newly diagnosed with nAMD. Univariable Cox proportional analysis indicates that patients with diabetes exposed to GLP-1 RAs had a substantially higher incidence of diagnosis than those who were not (.2% versus .1%; difference, .1%; 95% CI, .08%-.12%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.58-2.82).1', 'In addition to GLP-1 RAs, the study also indicated that increased age and a history of cerebrovascular accident were associated with a significantly increased risk of nAMD (age: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18; cerebrovascular accident: HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.15-3.34).1', 'Shor and colleagues noted that these results are consistent with the growing body of literature questioning the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, the use of which has been dramatically increasing in recent years.

They help reduce blood sugar levels, slow digestion and reduce appetite.', 'But a study by Canadian scientists published in Jama Ophthalmology has found that after six months of use GLP-1 RAs are associated with double the risk of older people with diabetes developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared with similar patients not taking the drugs.', 'Academics at the University of Toronto examined medical data for more than 1 million Ontario residents with a diagnosis of diabetes and identified 46,334 patients with an average age of 66 who were prescribed GLP-1 RAs. Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.', 'The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.', 'Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.', 'The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.', 'Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.', 'Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.', '“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”', 'In an accompanying editorial, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.', '“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.', 'VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”', 'A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.', '“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”', 'Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary.

Signs and symptoms of nAMD include blurred vision, difficulty seeing at a distance or doing detailed work, blind spots developing in the line of sight, difficulty distinguishing between colors and edges, and straight lines appearing wavy.

Ozempic and blindness: Is vision loss a side effect of this weight loss drug?,https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/link-between-ozempic-and-blindness/,"['There is a lot of curiosity around Semaglutide, which is sold under different brands, including Ozempic. It may help to control blood sugar levels and support weight loss. But the medicine, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for type 2 diabetes management, may also cause nausea and diarrhea. These common side effects may disappear once your body gets used to the weekly jabs. However, there are also studies that have linked this medicine to vision loss. Is there any connection between Ozempic and blindness? Let’s find out.', 'Ozempic (semaglutide) is an injectable medication classified as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. “GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that plays a major role in glucose regulation, especially after eating,” says endocrinologist Dr Dheeraj Kapoor. Administered once weekly via subcutaneous injection, the medicine is primarily used along with a healthy diet and exercise to control blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. It is also used for weight loss.', 'Here are some of the benefits of Ozempic:', 'Ozempic and blindness don’t have a direct link. However, there are a few potential indirect links:', 'For people with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina, rapid improvements in blood sugar control, such as those seen with medications like Ozempic, can sometimes be associated with a temporary worsening of retinopathy. “This is a known phenomenon in diabetes management, not exclusive to Ozempic. This temporary worsening could potentially impact vision if not monitored,” says Dr Kapoor. In a two-year trial involving people with diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, more cases of diabetic retinopathy complications were seen in participants treated with Ozempic (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%), as per the US Food and Drug Administration.', 'There are studies that have suggested a possible association between Ozempic and blindness. A link between semaglutide and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) was found during a 2024 study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. “It is a condition involving sudden vision loss due to a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve,” says Dr Kapoor. A new review, published in JAMA Ophthalmology in January 2025, showed that nine people taking semaglutide and tirzepatide either experienced NAION, papillitis or paracentral acute middle maculopathy. These conditions lead to vision loss.', 'If vision changes were related to a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy due to rapid glycemic improvement, vision might stabilise. “It may improve over time, regardless of whether Ozempic is continued, as the overall glucose control improves,” says the expert. If the vision changes were linked to other factors, such as NAION, the outcome would depend on the nature and extent of the optic nerve damage. “In NAION or other eye conditions, vision loss is often permanent, although some people may experience partial recovery,” says the expert. So, the reversibility of vision changes after stopping Ozempic depends entirely on the underlying cause of the vision issue.', 'The link between Ozempic and blindness may not be obvious, but there are side effects that you can expect. The side effects of Ozempic primarily involve the gastrointestinal system:', 'Less common, but potentially more serious side effects of Ozempic can include:', 'Preventing potential eye issues and other side effects while on Ozempic involves:', 'It is important to note that Ozempic and blindness are not usually connected, and vision loss is not a commonly reported or an expected side effect of this weight loss drug.

Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is the active substance in certain medicines used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity (namely Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy).', 'After reviewing all available data on NAION with semaglutide, PRAC has recommended that the product information for semaglutide medicines is updated to include NAION as a side effect with a frequency of ‘very rare’ (it may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people). If patients experience a sudden loss of vision or rapidly worsening eyesight during treatment with semaglutide, they should contact their doctor without delay. If NAION is confirmed, treatment with semaglutide should be stopped.', 'More information is available in EMA’s public health communication.', 'EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) is reviewing the known risk of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) with two varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, Varilrix and Varivax, following a report of a fatal outcome after vaccination with Varilrix.', 'Varilrix and Varivax are authorised for vaccination of adults and children from 12 months of age, and in certain populations from 9 months of age, against chickenpox. They contain live attenuated (weakened) varicella virus.', 'Varicella is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes shingles (herpes zoster). Varicella mainly affects children aged 2-8 years where it is usually a mild disease and children recover quickly. In some cases, varicella can cause complications including bacterial infection of the skin or blood, pneumonia (infection and inflammation of the lungs) and encephalitis. Encephalitis can also be caused by other viral or bacterial infections. While most people with encephalitis recover, the condition can be life-threatening.', 'This review was initiated by the PRAC following a case report in Poland of a child who developed encephalitis a few days after receiving the Varilrix vaccine. The patient died of the consequences of encephalitis several days later. As a precaution, the Polish medicines agency has suspended the distribution of vaccines from the batch in question. ', 'These vaccines are widely used across the EU, and encephalitis is listed as a side effect in their product information based on rare reports during post-marketing surveillance.', 'The committee will now assess all available evidence to better understand the risk of encephalitis and to determine if any regulatory action is necessary.', 'While EMA is investigating the issue, the vaccines can continue to be used in line with the approved product information.', 'Agenda of the PRAC meeting 2-5 June 2025', 'English (EN) (574.26 KB - PDF)', 'PRAC statistics: June 2025', 'English (EN) (33.18 MB - PDF)', 'Abbreviations used in EMA scientific committees and CMD documents, and in relation to EMA’s regulatory activities', 'English (EN) (434.08 KB - PDF)', 'Media enquiries', 'Tel. +31 (0)88 781 8427\nE-mail: press@ema.europa.eu', 'All other enquiries', 'please submit your request via the online form', 'Follow us on Bluesky(link is external)', 'Product emergency hotline', 'OUTSIDE WORKING HOURS', 'European Medicines Agency\nDomenico Scarlattilaan 6\n1083 HS Amsterdam\nThe Netherlands', 'Tel: +31 (0)88 781 6000', 'How to find us\nPostal address and deliveries\nBusiness hours and holidays']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUNhREE1T0dFdFVHY3pVVmRHVFJDcUJCaXFCQ2dLTWdZcE5JNlFNUVk=-w280-h168-p-df
