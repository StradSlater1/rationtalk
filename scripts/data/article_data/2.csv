"ENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY BY ADDRESSING
RISKS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY",https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/enhancing-national-security-by-addressing-risks-at-harvard-university/,"['BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n \nA PROCLAMATION', 'Admission into the United States to attend, conduct research, or teach at our Nation’s institutions of higher education is a privilege granted by our Government, not a guarantee.  That privilege is necessarily tied to the host institution’s compliance and commitment to following Federal law.  Harvard University has failed in this respect, among many others.', 'The Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) depends fundamentally on academic institutions’ good faith, transparency, and full adherence to the relevant regulatory frameworks.  This is for crucial national-security reasons.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries and competitors take advantage of easy access to American higher education to, among other things, steal technical information and products, exploit expensive research and development to advance their own ambitions, and spread false information for political or other reasons.  Our adversaries, including the People’s Republic of China, try to take advantage of American higher education by exploiting the student visa program for improper purposes and by using visiting students to collect information at elite universities in the United States.', 'Protecting our national security requires host institutions of foreign students to provide sufficient information, when asked, to enable the Federal Government to identify and address misconduct by those foreign students.  In my judgment, it presents an unacceptable risk to our Nation’s security for an academic institution to refuse to provide sufficient information, when asked, about known instances of misconduct and criminality committed by its foreign students.  This principle is one reason why SEVP regulations require foreign students to obey Federal and State criminal laws and require universities to keep records about foreign students’ studies in the United States — including records relating to criminal activity by foreign students and resulting disciplinary proceedings — and furnish them to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on request.', 'Crime rates at Harvard University — including violent crime rates — have drastically risen in recent years.  Harvard has failed to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus.  Given these facts, it is imperative, in my judgment, that the Federal Government be able to assess and, if necessary, address misconduct and crimes committed by foreign students at Harvard.', 'Despite the risks described above, Harvard University has refused the recent requests of the DHS for information about foreign students’ “known illegal activity,” “known dangerous and violent activity,” “known threats to other students or university personnel,” “known deprivation of rights of other classmates or university personnel,” and whether those activities “occurred on campus,” and other related data.  Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions.  Harvard’s actions show that it either is not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.  In my judgment, these actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government’s ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law.', 'These concerns have compelled the Federal Government to conclude that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.  When a university refuses to uphold its legal obligations, including its recordkeeping and reporting obligations, the consequences ripple far beyond the campus.  They jeopardize the integrity of the entire United States student and exchange visitor visa system, compromise national security, and embolden other institutions to similarly disregard the rule of law.', 'Harvard University has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign countries, including our adversaries.  According to The Harvard Crimson, Harvard has received more than $150 million in total contributions from foreign governments over the last 5 years, and over $1 billion from foreign sources.  Over the last 10 years, Harvard has received more than $150 million from China alone.  In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, “repeatedly hosted and trained members of a Chinese Communist Party paramilitary organization,” according to a probe by the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.  Harvard researchers have also partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization, according to the same probe.', 'Finally, Harvard University continues to flout the civil rights of its students and faculty, triggering multiple Federal investigations.  Harvard’s discrimination against disfavored races in admissions was so blatant that the Supreme Court decision ending the practice nationwide bears Harvard’s name.  Yet even after that Supreme Court decision, Harvard and its affiliated organizations on campus continue to deny hardworking Americans equal opportunities.  Instead of those Americans, Harvard admits students from non-egalitarian nations, including nations that seek the destruction of the United States and its allies, or the extermination of entire peoples.  It is not in the interest of the United States to further compound Harvard’s discrimination against non-preferred races, national origins, shared ancestries, or religions by further reducing opportunities for American students through excessive foreign student enrollment.', 'Considering these facts, I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.  Such restrictions are authorized under sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), which authorize the President to suspend entry of any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers.  Until such time as the university shares the information that the Federal Government requires to safeguard national security and the American public, it is in the national interest to deny foreign nationals access to Harvard under the auspices of educational exchange.', 'NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the entry into the United States of persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.

Operational Action to Implement this Order.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate to take all necessary and appropriate action to implement this proclamation.  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall also consider using their respective authorities under the INA to impose limitations on Harvard University’s ability to participate in the SEVP and the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.  Any such actions should include an exception for any alien whose entry would be in the national interest, as determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or their respective designees.', 'Sec. 4.

The fallout from Trump's war on Harvard will long outlast his presidency,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln9lexyedo,"['Donald Trump has had a busy seven days. On Monday, he threatened to redirect $3bn in Harvard research funding to vocational schools. On Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to federal agencies, instructing them to review the approximately $100m in contracts the government has awarded Harvard and ""find alternative vendors"" where possible. On Wednesday, he had more to say on the matter still.', '""Harvard\'s got to behave themselves,"" he told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. ""Harvard is treating our country with great disrespect, and all they\'re doing is getting in deeper and deeper and deeper.""', ""When combined with other administration attempts – freezing more than $3bn in research grants and suspending foreign students from enrolling in Harvard – Trump's directives represent a frontal attack on one of America's most prestigious, and wealthy, institutions of higher education."", 'Even if court challenges overrule some of these actions – some have already been put on hold – the impact is being felt across the landscape of American higher education.', '""They\'re doing multiple things every single day, some of those things are sneaking through,"" says Greg Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors. ""But more importantly, they\'re changing the culture. They\'re changing people.""', 'At Harvard\'s commencement ceremonies on Thursday, students said there was a ""palpable concern"" on campus.', '""People sort of knew Trump was trying some of these moves but [they were] shocked when it happens,"" admits one graduate, a British national who requested anonymity because he was concerned public comments could threaten his US work visa. ""It feels like the nuclear option.""', '""If this can happen to Harvard it can happen to any university in the country,"" he adds.', 'But the repercussions of this apparent Harvard-Trump fight run far deeper than the management of a single Ivy League university. Could the measures Trump is taking mark, as some suggest, the latest, albeit most ambitious, step by conservatives to erode some of the traditional pillars of support for the Democratic Party?', ""If that is the case, the campus has become a pivotal battle in shaping America's cultural and political landscape."", ""Trump and his administration have offered various explanations for their actions, including a perceived lack of conservatives among the ranks of Harvard's professors, along with suggestions of admitting too many foreign students and financial links to China."", ""But according to the White House, the most immediate cause has been the university's apparent failure to address antisemitism on campus, in the wake of anti-Israel protests at universities across the US since the start of the Gaza war."", 'In December 2023, three prominent university presidents - including the then-president of Harvard, Claudine Gay - struggled to answer whether calling for the ""genocide of Jews"" violated their student conduct codes on bullying and harassment, sparking a firestorm of criticism.', 'Dr Gay, who was asked the question at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses, answered that it depended on the context. She later apologised, telling the student newspaper: ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don\'t know how you could feel anything but regret.""', 'On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to cut off federal funding and government accreditation for colleges that he said were engaging in ""antisemitic propaganda"". Once Trump returned to the White House in January, he began following through on this.', 'Several universities - including Columbia, which saw some of the most high profile protests - agreed to sweeping changes in campus security rules and closer supervision of its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies departments.', ""In April, Harvard released the results of a university task force review (commissioned before Trump's election) of antisemitism and anti-Muslim prejudice on its own campus. It found that many Jewish and Muslim students faced bias, exclusion and alienation from the university curriculum and its community."", 'However, the administration\'s demands go well beyond calls to address antisemitism. In a letter to the university, its ""Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism"" laid out a laundry list of changes that Harvard must make, including terminating diversity programmes, reforming admissions and hiring, screening foreign students for views hostile to ""American values"", and expanding and protecting ""viewpoint diversity"" among students and faculty.', ""Trump's shock-and-awe strategy of rapid and aggressive pressure has stunned many in higher education, who never imagined the scope of the demands or the force behind them."", '""It\'s not about higher education,"" argues Mr Wolfson. ""Higher education is one of the levers they see as critical to transforming our society.""', ""But the potential for a long-term transformation could largely depend on whether the majority of American universities choose to accommodate the administration's demands - or whether it stands and fights, as Harvard is trying to do."", ""While Harvard has been the most prominent target of the administration's ire, and the most visible in its resistance, it is just one of many high-profile American universities that has received funding cuts or been subject of investigations."", 'Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have reported that the administration has suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in their research grants. The Department of Education has launched investigations of 10 universities for alleged antisemitism - and warned dozens of others that they could face similar inquiries. It is also investigating 52 universities for illegal race-based programmes.', 'To some, this all amounts to an across-the-board war on elite higher education by the Trump administration in an effort to reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image. To others, this is no bad thing.', '""Universities are not about the pursuit of knowledge, they\'re about the forceful pushing of a left-wing world view,"" Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, said in a Fox News interview last month. ""We\'re here to shake it up.""', 'Many on the right have long viewed American college campuses as hotbeds of liberal indoctrination, whether it has taken the form of left-wing anti-war radicalism in the 1960s, ""political correctness"" of the 1990s, Occupy Wall Street anti-capitalism of the 2000s or the Black Lives Matter movement and anti-Israel demonstrations in recent years.', ""Polling has illustrated a certain divide in beliefs between those who have and haven't attended college. In a recent survey by the polling company Civiqs, non-college graduates were split on the job Trump is doing in office, with 49% disapproving and 47% approving."", ""College graduates, on the other hand, had a significantly different view, as 58% disapproved of Trump's performance in office versus only 38% who approved."", '""I think a lot of this blowback is from the sense that they have become the universities of blue [Democratic] America, and that this is the consequence,"" says Rick Hess, senior fellow and director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.', 'In recent years, according to Mr Hess, American higher education has become more closely tied to the government and more reliant on government funding.', 'He says that the new Trump team has simply adopted levers of control over higher education employed by recent Democratic administrations – including civil rights investigations, federal anti-discrimination laws and control over funding.', '""In classic Trump form,"" he added, ""it\'s absolutely the case that these levers have been turned up to 11.""', 'And there are fewer procedural and legal safeguards than there were under the Joe Biden and Barack Obama presidencies.', '""It\'s both an evolution and a revolution,"" says Mr Hess.', ""But it is one, he argues, that universities have brought on themselves by being overtly political during Trump's first term and making elite school the face of American higher education."", '""The price for collecting billions a year in tax dollars is that institutions should both honour the promises they make, such as enforcing civil rights law, and hew to a mission in which they explicitly serve the whole nation,"" says Mr Hess.', 'Withholding federal funding from universities may be a new challenge for higher education, but to some this is just the latest in a long effort by conservatives to undercut key traditional pillars of liberal power.', 'Through a combination of legislation and court rules, the influence of labour unions – which had provided the Democratic Party with volunteer personnel and funds – had diminished long before Trump succeeded in winning over white working-class voters in his three presidential runs.', ""State-level lawsuit reforms have also curtailed the vast sums that trial lawyers could contribute to Democratic coffers. And ongoing efforts to shrink the government workforce – which reached a peak with Elon Musk's Doge reductions – have eroded another traditionally Democratic bloc."", ""However, Mr Wolfson fears that something greater could be lost if some of the Trump administration's measures are enforced."", '""The fact that we have multiracial, multicultural, multinational universities is a boon to our universities,"" he says. ""It creates really diverse communities, really diverse intellectual thought.""', ""Harvard - perhaps best known for its renowned law school - has turned the courts into its principal tool to resist Trump's pressure."", ""On Thursday, a federal judge indefinitely suspended the administration's attempts to prohibit foreign students from receiving visas to attend the university."", 'The university has also sued to prevent the Trump administration from terminating more than $2.2bn in federal grants, although that case is pending.', '""The trade-off put to Harvard and other universities is clear,"" Harvard wrote in its complaint filed with a Massachusetts federal court. ""Allow the government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardise the institution\'s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions.""', 'Harvard\'s president, Alan Garber, has also defended his university, saying that Harvard would be ""firm"" in its commitments to education and truth, during an interview with NPR.', '""Harvard is a very old institution, much older than the country,"" he continued. ""As long as there has been a United States of America, Harvard has thought that its role is to serve the nation.""', 'Trump, meanwhile, has shared strong words of his own. ""Harvard wants to fight,"" he said on Wednesday. ""They want to show how smart they are, and they\'re getting their ass kicked.""', ""Opinion polls show that Trump's political base supports his efforts, and the underlying message. Yet those same polls suggest a majority of the general population support American universities and don't approve of his proposed funding cuts."", ""And opinion aside, the practicality of achieving such a fundamental reordering of America's system of higher education, even with all the tools at the federal government's disposal, is a daunting task."", 'According to Mr Wolfson, however, repairing what he says is the damage being done to academic independence will be equally challenging.', 'A growing number of members of the American Association of University Professors fear the consequences of expressing political views or conducting disfavoured research.', '""The destruction is real,"" argues Mr Wolfson. ""Even if the courts step in, there will still be a massive undermining of the higher education project in this country due to Trump\'s reckless, reckless moves.""', ""Mr Hess, who has pushed for conservative education reform for years, is less concerned. He believes that Trump's chaotic, scattershot approach - including last week's comments - could end up less effective than a more methodical restructuring of American universities."", '""This is all an ambitious experiment,"" Mr Hess said. ""Whether it\'s a strategy that\'s going to work is very much an open question.""', ""One thing seems clear, however. Even if American universities resist - or outlast - Trump's efforts, they are no longer insulated from the scorched-earth warfare of American politics. The walls of the ivory tower have been breached, regardless of whether one believes it is the barbarians - or liberators - at the gate."", 'Top image credit: Getty Images', 'BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

International Students Hit With Back-to-Back Orders,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/06/06/trump-proclamations-escalate-international-student,"['Trump issued two orders Wednesday night that could deal a major blow to international enrollment. One targets Harvard; the other restricts travel from more than a dozen countries, raising alarms across higher ed.', 'By  Liam Knox', '', 'Photo illustration by Justin Morrison/Inside Higher Ed | Andrew Harnik/Getty Images | A Mokhtari/DigitalVision Vectors/Getty Images', 'President Trump issued two directives targeting international students just hours apart on Wednesday night. One is a ban on entering the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and heightened visa restrictions for those from another seven. The other bans all international students, researchers and other “exchange visitors” from Harvard University.', 'The orders represent another escalation of the Trump administration’s simultaneous, and sometimes overlapping, campaigns to both punish Harvard and curtail the number of foreign students studying in the U.S.', 'Chris Glass, a professor of higher education at Boston College and a member of the college’s Center for International Education, said the combination of the travel ban and the Harvard order are part of the administration’s “flood the zone” strategy for its higher education agenda. He added that the timing of the dual orders, following on the heels of a “seemingly indefinite” pause on student visa interviews and a promise to “aggressively revoke” Chinese students’ visas, seems intended to cause the most chaos possible.', '“The timing couldn’t be worse … this is when 70 percent of international students are getting or renewing their visas,” he said. “It injects catastrophic uncertainty, and the uncertainty is the strategy from my perspective.”', 'On Thursday evening, Harvard filed a legal challenge to the proclamation targeting the university and asked a judge to issue a temporary restraining order against the administration. Judge Allison Burroughs from the District of Massachusetts quickly granted that request and extended the current restraining order issued last month. She set a hearing for June 16.', 'The last time Trump instituted a travel ban, in his first term, it threw colleges into chaos and left students and researchers stranded for months in the middle of winter break, sending colleges scrambling to find ways to bring them back. Higher ed has been bracing for a repeat of that travel ban since Trump was elected in November; many institutions told their international students to return to campus before the inauguration to avoid the same fate.', 'The new ban is not as drastic as many predicted; when the White House initially proposed another travel ban in March, officials rolled out a list of 43 potential target countries. But it is more expansive than the 2017 ban—it affects 19 countries instead of eight—and, combined with the administration’s barrage of attacks on international students over the past three months, could be even more damaging to international enrollment.', 'The full ban applies to Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen—largely Middle Eastern and African countries with substantial Muslim populations. Trump also restricted visas from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The travel ban doesn’t immediately affect students currently in the U.S. or who have already been approved for visas. But with many admitted international students still languishing in a visa process that the State Department halted two weeks ago, it will likely prevent thousands of students from attending in the fall and upend institutions’ projected enrollments.', 'The countries on the list send a relatively small number of students to U.S. colleges. Of the affected countries, Iran has by far the most students studying in the U.S. It is the 15th most common origin country for international students, with 12,430 studying at American colleges and universities as of fall 2024, according to the latest report from the Institute for International Education.', 'Still, the order is likely to compound the uncertainty and fear that has grown among international student populations, leading to signs of a large decline in student visa applications. Glass’s research, along with more recent reports, shows a double-digit decline in student visas from March 2024 to this March alone; the latest moves could double that, he said.', '“[The] COVID [pandemic] was a disruption of 15 percent,” he said. “This looks like it could be more significant than COVID, if the pause is extended and the uncertainty continues.”', 'In his proclamation announcing the travel ban, Trump wrote that the targeted countries had “deficient” vetting and screening processes for visa applicants, or had “taken advantage of the United States in their exploitation of our visa system and their historic failure to accept back their removable nationals.”', 'Sarah Spreitzer, vice president and chief of staff for government relations at the American Council on Education, said the rationale outlined in the travel ban—that students pose a unique national security threat and have been overstaying their visas—doesn’t align with reality.', '“If this is for national security concerns, our students are some of the most vetted visas out there,” she said. “And I don’t know if our students actually overstay their visas very often.”', 'Fanta Aw, the president of NAFSA, an association of international educators, echoed Spreitzer and said that international students are already “among the most tracked individuals entering the United States.”', '“Actions such as halting student visa issuance and implementing nationality-based travel bans do not enhance national security,” she wrote in an email. “Instead, they weaken it—undermining our economy, diminishing our global competitiveness and eroding our country’s ability to effectively engage with the global population.”', 'The 2017 travel ban was amended twice after being challenged in the courts and eventually exempted nonimmigrant visas, including student and exchange visas. Spreitzer said the administration’s outsize focus on student visa holders over the last few months makes that outcome less likely, but only time—and the courts—will tell.', 'The travel ban came on the heels of another White House proclamation Wednesday night, this one banning foreign students and scholars from attending Harvard.', 'Trump restricted visa applicants from entering the country “solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard,” claiming that allowing foreign students on campus would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers.”', 'A Harvard spokesperson wrote that the proclamation is “another illegal retaliatory step taken by the administration in violation of Harvard’s first amendment rights” and that the university “will continue to protect its international students.”', 'The proclamation is the latest jab in a weeks-long fight over international students on Harvard’s campus. Last month the Trump administration attempted to revoke Harvard’s Student Exchange and Visitor Program certification, which would have banned the university from enrolling international students altogether, affecting not just visa applicants but also foreign students and researchers currently on campus. Harvard challenged the effort in court, and a judge swiftly granted the university an injunction; on Monday, the Trump administration lost its appeal to overturn that decision.', 'Harvard amended that lawsuit to include a challenge to the newest proclamation, calling it “an unlawful evasion of the Court’s order.”', '“When the Court enjoined the Secretary [of State’s] efforts to revoke Harvard’s certifications and force its students to transfer or depart the country, the President sought to achieve the same result by refusing to allow Harvard students to enter in the first place,” the amended suit reads.', 'Unlike the SEVP decertification attempt, Trump’s executive proclamation doesn’t immediately affect international students currently enrolled at Harvard, only those who have yet to secure visas—though it does instruct the State Department to determine whether current students “should have their visas revoked.”', 'The proclamation runs through a gamut of justifications for its international student ban. Trump cites data on increasing campus crime rates in the interest of student safety, alleges discrimination in the admissions process that he claims foreign students exacerbate and points to academic partnerships and financial contributions from countries like China that he says endanger U.S. national security interests.', 'Notably, Trump also says Harvard has failed to cooperate with the administration’s demands for student misconduct records; the university has provided data on “only three students,” which Trump wrote was evidence that “it either is not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.”', 'Glass said the move is almost certainly an attempt to work around the court injunction using executive powers rather than the visa bureaucracy. And making the issue about constitutional authority in the national security realm—rather than whether the proper SEVP decertification process was followed—could change the legal calculus in court.', '“That’s what’s going to set a precedent for generations,” Glass said. “Will the precedent of autonomy and academic freedom at Harvard win in the courts? Or will the precedent of national security powers for the government win the day?”', '(This story has been updated to correct the list of banned countries to include Republic of the Congo.)', 'In April, unexpected changes to students’ SEVIS statuses required staff to manually check on them each day.', 'In April, unexpected changes to students’ SEVIS statuses required staff to manually check on them each day.', 'After a series of court losses spurred Trump officials to change course on their international student agenda, they’v', 'The Trump administration’s latest effort to revive its student deportation campaign could drastically curtail the lar', 'Build an institutional culture that embraces innovation in teaching and learning.', 'Subscribe for free to Inside Higher Ed’s newsletters, featuring the latest news, opinion and great new careers in higher education — delivered to your inbox.', 'View Newsletters', 'Copyright © 2025 Inside Higher Ed All rights reserved. | Website designed by nclud', '4/5\nArticles remaining\nthis month.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNUtSVEIxVUd0alNFeG1RbWhvVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdrUkFJem5EV3dHVHdF=-w280-h168-p-df

Harvard could beat Trump in court but lose the war with his administration,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/05/trump-harvard-battle-unwinnable-visas-students/,"['The university added a complaint Thursday to its lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke its ability to enroll international students.', 'When the Trump administration tried to take away Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students, the university filed a lawsuit, and a federal judge blocked the order the next day.', 'But even as that case — and another lawsuit the university has filed against the administration — winds through the courts, President Donald Trump had already made his next move, with a proclamation Wednesday aiming to keep international students out of Harvard.', 'And by Thursday afternoon, Harvard had gone back to court. The university’s lawyers filed an amended complaint in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, arguing Trump’s action is unlawful and unconstitutional.', '“The proclamation,” the university’s lawyers wrote, “is a patent effort to do an end-run around this Court’s order.”', 'Hours later, Harvard asked the court to block Trump’s proclamation, filing a motion for a temporary restraining order, and it was swiftly granted. Thousands of international students have been admitted and are expected to come to campus for the summer and fall terms, lawyers wrote, and about a quarter of the student body is at risk of having their visas revoked and being subject to deportation, including nearly half of all graduate students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.', 'Harvard may prevail in court. But the escalating feud has some experts predicting that even if the school wins every case, it won’t escape unscathed.', 'Follow Trump’s second term', 'That’s because even if judges continue blocking Trump’s action the administration holds enormous power over how visas are actually granted, experts said. The Trump administration has shown a willingness to try aggressive and untested tactics. The administration’s relentless attack on Harvard is having a chilling effect on current and prospective students and faculty, raising questions about whether the school will lose top talent as the battle continues.', 'There is more than one way, experts said, to punish Harvard.', '“Harvard can win everything in the courtroom and still lose in the long run,” said Allison Wu, a 2022 Harvard Business School graduate who leads the 1636 Forum, a group of Harvard alumni that has pressured the university to change.', 'It is not just the fight over international students. The Trump administration also has frozen more than $2.2 billion in research funding to Harvard, threatened to revoke the university’s tax-exempt status and initiated federal investigations in an effort to force change at the school.', 'Harvard filed a sweeping lawsuit, challenging the administration’s withholding of federal funding as a means to control academic decision-making at the school.', 'Yet, even if the contracts and grants are restored, the administration can still deny future grants and contracts. Last month the education secretary froze all new grants to Harvard.', 'The practical impact of losing those funds — combined with the ongoing drama — may push away top student and faculty prospects, Wu said. There is a meaningful difference between attracting excellent students and those at the very top, she said, such as someone who might win a Nobel Prize. Harvard, Wu said, may start losing those very top prospects.', '“The sheer level of uncertainty really increases the risks that people leave Harvard or are poached by other institutions or don’t come,” she said.', 'At the same time, the administration has the power to reverse its campaign against Harvard, and the president has been known to shift gears on important policy matters, sometimes abruptly.', 'But for now, Harvard is pushing ahead with legal challenges, and the administration’s actions could weaken what has long been seen as one of America’s premier universities.', 'Administration officials have argued that they are taking necessary steps to protect national security and ensure campuses are safe and welcoming for Jewish students.', 'On Thursday, Trump predicted success as he spoke about the administration’s demand that Harvard turn over information about any foreign students’ illegal, dangerous and violent behavior. “They’re going to be giving us the list now,” he said at the White House. “I think they’re starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth.”', 'On Thursday, Harvard President Alan Garber told the campus community that the school had amended its lawsuit and would ask the court to immediately halt the enforcement of the proclamation. Contingency plans were being developed to ensure that international students and scholars can continue to pursue their work at Harvard this summer and through the coming academic year, he said.', 'Harvard’s international students and scholars make outstanding contributions, Garber said, adding: “We will celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights.”', 'Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard’s certification to enroll foreign students, saying the university had allowed “anti-American, pro-terrorist” foreigners “to harass and physically assault” people and that the university had worked with a Chinese Communist Party paramilitary group. Harvard challenged the action the next day, and within hours a federal judge had blocked it.', 'On Wednesday, Trump tried again. He issued the proclamation that sought to suspend for six months the entry of international students planning to attend Harvard, and it called on the secretary of state to consider whether current students should have their visas revoked.', 'The State Department has enormous authority over who is granted a visa. Consular officers “can refuse a visa on any grounds,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. They are not required to explain their reasoning, she said, and those who are rejected generally have no power to challenge the decision.', 'Applications also can be put into “administrative processing,” she said, describing this as a “black hole” that has no timeline and where applicants have no clue what is happening with their cases.', 'Visa officers at the State Department have been directed to scrutinize applications from Harvard students. “I suspect that we’re going to see a much higher visa denial rate for incoming Harvard students, even though Harvard may win the litigation battle,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired professor of immigration law at Cornell University.', 'For students, Dalal-Dheini said, the result is that they may not get a decision until the semester has begun. She added that switching to another school is difficult and often too late by the time one finds out their application is in limbo.', 'That means students and researchers may stop choosing Harvard because of the uncertainty, several people said.', ""And it’s not just Harvard. “I would imagine would-be students all over the world are reconsidering whether the United States is as desirable a destination as they thought,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the Migration Policy Institute's U.S. immigration policy program."", '“I’m really worried,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, a lobbying group that advocates for colleges and universities. “It’s so much easier to break things than it is to repair them.”', 'Even as Harvard faces these headwinds, its legal case is strong, many experts said. Harvard argues that the denial of visas amounts to “direct retaliation” against the university for refusing to cede control of its academic prerogatives.', 'On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Harvard said Trump’s proclamation was “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.” Harvard would continue to protect its international students, the spokesperson added.', 'Some saw Trump’s proclamation as a tacit acknowledgment that the earlier attempt by DHS was legally defective.', '“Most competent lawyers don’t want to defend a hopelessly losing case,” said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University. He called the original ban “blatantly contrary” to regulation and procedure. With the proclamation, the administration is looking for a do-over, Super said.', 'Unlike executive orders, presidential proclamations typically do not have the force and effect of law, unless the president is given the authority by the Constitution or federal law, according to the Library of Congress.', 'Trump’s proclamation cites several immigration statutes to justify its restrictions on international students. But those laws don’t fit what the administration is attempting to do, Super said. For instance, one of the statutes covers prohibitions on how people can enter the country, but “has nothing to do with who enters and certainly not what educational institution they go to,” Super said.', 'The proclamation also alleged that Harvard’s international students pose a national security threat because they could be used by foreign countries or businesses to steal or exploit American research or spread misinformation. It linked Harvard to China and alleged that China was exploiting the student visa program. And it painted the university’s admission of international students as denying opportunity to American applicants, which it labeled a form of discrimination.', 'Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, was also skeptical of the alleged national security concerns cited in the proclamation. “That could be a tough road to convince judges that international students at one of our most selective colleges in the country present a threat,” she said.', 'The school’s decision to fight has been celebrated by many students, faculty and alumni. Even if the university does suffer damage from the battle, much of the Harvard community is bolstered by its willingness to defend its academic independence.', 'Another of Trump’s targets, Columbia University, took a different tack. It has been in talks with the administration for months and has made numerous changes that align with its demands. Despite that, it hasn’t had its research funding restored. And on Wednesday, not long before Trump issued his proclamation about Harvard, his education secretary announced another strike on Columbia: They notified the school’s accrediting body that it did not meet standards because it was allegedly in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.', 'The support for Harvard’s approach was evident at the school’s commencement last month, when Garber was greeted with a sustained standing ovation.', '“When we all received that email from President Garber saying that Harvard was not going to capitulate to the Trump administration’s demands, we felt really buoyed,” said Elisabeth Stelson, a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of epidemiology at Harvard T.H.

Campbell filed an amicus brief in support of Petrova two weeks ago, calling for her release.', '“The Trump Administration’s policy of punitive immigration enforcement — whether through seizing and detaining students whose political views it disagrees with, like Ms. Öztürk; detaining academics who fail to declare nontoxic substances, like Ms. Petrova; or effecting mass terminations of student records, which the administration could not even defend — is unlawful and creates an atmosphere of fear amongst all immigrants, including students and academics, in Massachusetts,” Campbell wrote.', 'Other Massachusetts officials have also criticized President Donald Trump’s spat with Harvard’s international community, including Senator Elizabeth A.

This also affects TUM students.', 'She wishes to remain anonymous. Others who are currently studying or working at Harvard University no longer respond to inquiries. This is understandable, as attracting negative attention from the U.S. government could result in the loss of one\'s visa. The young woman talking to us is studying in a master\'s program at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology. Until a few days ago, she was a visiting researcher as part of a study program at Harvard Business School. She came to the USA at the beginning of the year with a ""J1 Student Internship"" visa, i.e. a residence permit for a student internship. Harvard had already recommended that she entered the country before Trump\'s inauguration on January 20. ""It was anticipated early on that there could be difficulties.""', 'However, when entering the country, it also depends on which border officials you meet. The TUM student left and re-entered the country once over Easter. ""The border officer was very friendly and congratulated me on Harvard."" But she had also heard of completely different experiences. She has since left the country, a plan she had already made earlier.', 'Since Trump took office, there has been a great deal of uncertainty on campus, particularly among students from countries that the president deems hostile, including China, communist countries, Muslim countries, and some African countries. Then, at the end of May, the bombshell came: According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Harvard would no longer be permitted to enroll new international students. Those already enrolled would have to transfer to another university or risk losing their residence status. The university has filed a lawsuit against this decision. However, the U.S. government is not backing down. According to U.S. media outlets, the government has ordered checks of the online activities of all visa applicants to study at Harvard. This would affect researchers and guest speakers as well. And most recently, the US administration imposed an entry ban for all international students at Harvard. A court has blocked this decision, but uncertainty remains.', 'Many do not know if they can legally remain in the country for the foreseeable future. They are looking for alternatives and trying to have a plan B in place. ""In addition to uncertainty, there is, of course, also despair and sadness at missing out on a great opportunity that has been worked toward for a long time,"" says the young TUM student who spent a few months in Cambridge. She is also in contact with full-time German students at Harvard via WhatsApp groups, where she observed downright panic. ""If an immigration officer gets hold of your cell phone and you haven\'t deleted your social media accounts, it\'s too late,"" says another TUM student who also wishes to remain anonymous because she might want to continue working in the U.S. She is conducting research at a hospital that sponsored her visa and the rules against Harvard don´t apply to her. However, she has friends who have already had their residence permits revoked because they applied for them through the university.', 'The Harvard International Office supports international students and researchers by providing updates, informational calls, and legal advice. The office recommends that students and researchers avoid conspicuous behavior, such as participating in protests, posting criticism on social media, or committing traffic offenses, so as not to attract the attention of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office. The German Academic Exchange Service also offers support.

Judge halts Trump’s proclamation to suspend new international student visas at Harvard hours after university filed amended lawsuit,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-trump-proclamation,"['A federal judge has halted President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to block international students from coming to Harvard University.', 'The temporary restraining order issued late Thursday by US District Judge Allison Burroughs came hours after the university urged the judge to step in on an emergency basis to block a proclamation Trump signed a day earlier that suspends international visas for new students. Foreign students make up roughly a quarter of the student body.', 'The brief order from Burroughs said if she didn’t intervene now, the school would “sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties” over the challenge to Trump’s edict. The judge said her order “shall remain in effect until further order of this Court.”', 'Burroughs, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, set a hearing for mid-June to hear arguments over whether she should block Trump’s proclamation indefinitely.', 'Despite the judge’s order, the State Department has ordered all US Embassies and Consulates around the world to deny visas to Harvard international students, according to a diplomatic cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio obtained by CNN.', 'Harvard’s request to block Trump’s ban amended an existing lawsuit over the administration’s move to end Harvard’s ability to enroll international students, which initially prompted the judge to stop the administration from revoking Harvard’s student visa program.', 'The amended lawsuit claimed Trump’s proclamation violated the First Amendment by temporarily blocking the entry of nearly all new international Harvard students under visas most use to study at US universities or participate in academic exchange programs.', 'Trump’s proclamation directed the secretary of state “to consider revoking” the visas – known as F, M and J visas – for current Harvard students who meet the proclamation’s “criteria,” the White House said in a statement.', '“With the stroke of a pen, the DHS Secretary and the President have sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission and the country,” the amended complaint reads.', '“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” it says.', 'Trump signs proclamation to suspend visas for new Harvard international students', 'The visa program, which allows international students “to enter the United States on nonimmigrant visas to enroll at Harvard and thousands of other schools, have boosted America’s academic, scientific, and economic success and its global standing,” the lawsuit says.', 'In its amended lawsuit, Harvard rebutted claims by the White House that the proclamation is an attempt to “safeguard national security” and said it represents “a government vendetta against Harvard.”', '“It escalates and intensifies the campaign of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment,” the amended suit reads. “… Just as the revocation unconstitutionally intrudes on academic freedom, the Proclamation unconstitutionally intrudes too.”', 'Trump’s proclamation hinges on a statute that gives the president authority to protect the nation from “any class of aliens whose entry would be detrimental” to the interests of the US, according to the document. But Harvard argues Trump is not suspending entry for any such class: “To the contrary, nonimmigrants may enter the country unabated, as long as they do not attend Harvard,” the lawsuit reads.', 'Trump’s proclamation accused the Ivy League institution of failing to address antisemitism on campus as well as persistently “prioritizing” diversity, equity, and inclusion – designed to advance racial, gender, class and other representation in public spaces – that Trump decries as “illegal and immoral discrimination.”', 'In a statement to the university community on Thursday, Harvard President Alan Garber said the proclamation is “yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard.”', 'Harvard’s international community, Garber said, “make outstanding contributions inside and outside of our classrooms and laboratories, fulfilling our mission of excellence in countless ways.” The institution will “celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights,” he added.', 'CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.', 'Harvard’s initial complaint pushing back against the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict foreign students, filed May 23, argued the revocation of its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program by the Department of Homeland Security was “clear retaliation” for its refusal of the government’s ideologically rooted policy demands.', 'Hours after the initial complaint was filed, Judge Burroughs temporarily blocked DHS’ decision to drop Harvard from SEVP, which would have made it impossible for the university to host any international students. Last week, the judge ordered the Trump administration not to make any changes to Harvard’s international student visa program indefinitely.', 'Attacks on Harvard by Trump administration have built for months. A timeline of the dispute', 'The amended complaint says the proclamation “is a patent effort to do an end-run around” the judge’s order. “What the DHS Secretary has purported to take away on the back end by revoking Harvard’s certifications to host foreign students, the President purports to take away on the front end by preventing the students and scholars invited to Harvard from gaining entry into the country in the first place,” the complaint reads.', 'Garber, in his statement, said Trump’s proclamation “circumvents” the judge’s temporary restraining order, adding he hopes the court “will act swiftly” in halting its enforcement. The Harvard International Office will be in direct contact with students and scholars who may be affected by Trump’s travel ban issued the same day, Garber wrote.', 'While Harvard has argued in legal filings that White House orders were behind the DHS move to revoke its ability to host international students, Wednesday’s proclamation marked the first time Trump became directly involved in the dispute at the center of his broader battle against elite US academics.', 'Harvard is battling the White House on two fronts – both of which are being overseen by Burroughs. The university filed its first lawsuit against the Trump administration for cutting more than $2.2 billion in federal funds and threatening billions more, as well as Harvard’s tax-exempt status. That money remains frozen as the case is pending in court, scheduled for arguments next month.', 'On the same day Burroughs said in her order that she wanted to “preserve the status quo” of Harvard’s international program as the case plays out, the State Department sent new instructions to diplomatic outposts around the world.', '“Effective immediately, adjudicating officers must refuse under INA 212(f) any qualified and otherwise eligible F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa applicants traveling to begin study or begin participation in an exchange visitor program at Harvard University,” reads a cable signed by Rubio and sent to US Embassies and Consulates. Although the cable was dated Friday morning, a source tells CNN officials received it Thursday night, shortly before Burroughs’ order.', 'The cable said that further details on exceptions to the rule in cases of “national interest” would be sent later. As of Friday afternoon, there had been no further guidance retracting the instructions in light of the judge’s order.', 'CNN reached out to Harvard and the State Department on Friday for comment on the new cable.', 'The judge had raised concern at a court hearing last week about reports that people seeking visas to study at the university in recent weeks had some trouble getting papers at US embassies but has not asked further questions about it.', 'Trump signs proclamation to ban travel from 12 countries', 'In its updated lawsuit, Harvard complained Thursday that another cable which was issued last week as Burroughs temporarily blocked a ban on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students had required increased scrutiny for prospective Harvard international students.', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio had justified last week’s cable by pointing to the DHS determination that Harvard failed to “maintain a campus environment free from violence” and antisemitism, the complaint says, citing the language in the cable.', 'The cable directed consular and diplomatic officers to conduct a “complete screening of the online presence” of any nonimmigrant visa applicant for Harvard, the complaint says, including “prospective students, students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakersk (sic), and tourists.”', 'Even if the applicant is “otherwise eligible” for the visa status, the cable informed recipients they must “refuse the case,” inform the applicant that their online presence is subject to review and they should make their social media accounts public, the complaint says.', 'But applicants who don’t have any social media platforms or those who set their accounts to private could be “reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant’s credibility” and be refused, according to the complaint.', 'CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the timing of the latest cable from the State Department.

The proclamation bans immigration to the United States, with some exceptions, from 19 countries. Lawful permanent residents sponsoring family members will be most affected. The measure will reduce legal immigrant admissions and lower the number of visas issued for tourists, students and exchange visitors from the identified countries. The action against Harvard represents another blow to the university and international students seeking to enroll at the school.', 'On June 4, 2025, Donald Trump issued a proclamation banning immigrant and temporary visas from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The proclamation also bans immigrant visas and visas for tourists and business travelers, students and exchange visitors for an additional seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The proclamation contains an exception for the spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens, known as immediate relatives, which limits the personal impact for many Americans. Among the other exemptions are for adoptions, Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans, visas for most athletes and “immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran.” These exceptions will not help most people who previously could have entered the country on temporary visas from the 19 countries or through other immigration categories.', 'While the Trump administration framed the proclamation as necessary for national security, it did not offer evidence that the travel ban enacted in Donald Trump’s first term enhanced security or that the Biden administration removing the travel ban diminished America’s security. Analysts noted the proclamation suspending refugee admissions was also framed as a security measure, even though refugees are the most vetted and screened individuals to enter the United States.', 'According to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis, the proclamation will likely block approximately 25,000 legal immigrants a year from the 19 countries. Family-sponsored immigrants will be the most affected by the proclamation, with the burden falling primarily on lawful permanent residents in the United States who sponsor close family members, particularly from Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Yemen.', 'A lawful permanent resident can sponsor a spouse, minor child or an unmarried adult child. Employment-based immigrants from the 19 countries unable to adjust status inside the United States will also be prevented from immigrating. Individuals from the 19 countries will not be allowed to immigrate via the Diversity Visa lottery.', 'Based on FY 2023 data, approximately 100,000 fewer B1/B2 visas for tourism or business, 10,000 F-1 student visas and 2,400 J-1 visas for nationals of the 19 countries will be issued annually due to the proclamation, according to an NFAP analysis. The proclamation would prevent growth in those numbers. The ban applies to visas to enter rather than people already inside the country, unless they leave and need a new visa to reenter.', 'CEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.', '', '', '', 'The administration sought to justify the bans on student and other visas by citing figures from the DHS annual overstay report. However, analysts note the DHS reports do not accurately measure overstays. “The DHS figures represent actual overstays plus arrivals whose departure could not be verified,” according to demographer Robert Warren. In other words, the report includes many unrecorded departures that may not be actual overstays.', 'DHS has problems with its systems correctly identifying individuals who changed status inside the U.S. or left the country, which renders its reports inappropriate for policy purposes. That is particularly the case with students, and it’s a long-standing problem. The “suspected in-country overstay” rate for student and exchange visitors in FY 2018 dropped by 60% over the course of a year, from 2.11% to 0.84% 12 months later, according to DHS, as the agency’s systems caught up.', 'The problem is most evident when a student obtains a different immigration status, such as a green card, and the student is withdrawn from the SEVIS system. In March 2025, when DHS arrested a pro-Palestinian protest leader, Mahmoud Khalil, agents thought he was on a student visa even though Khalil was married to a U.S. citizen and had been a lawful permanent resident for months.', 'The proclamation selectively cites overstay data. It omits Venezuela’s low overstay rate of 2.7% for F-1 student and exchange visitor visas. Iran’s low rate for F-1 student and exchange visitor visas is also not listed in the proclamation.', 'The proclamation criticizes Haiti, Venezuela and Afghanistan for lacking a reliable or functioning government even though the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status for the three countries and claimed it is safe for Haitians, Venezuelans and Afghans to return.', 'A view of the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In retaliation, the Department of Homeland Security removed Harvard’s ability to enroll international students through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. A federal judge blocked the Trump administration and will need to decide the legality of attempting to accomplish the same goal via a presidential proclamation.', '“They first tried to suspend SEVP and that failed, so now they are using an unsubstantiated threat to national security to halt the issuance of visas,” said Jonathan Grode of Green & Spiegel. “So, it is like, if we cannot stop you from issuing I-20s to students, then we will stop the State Department from issuing them visas.”', 'Attorneys and educators expect the latest administration move to have a further chilling effect on international students seeking to attend U.S. universities.', 'Although the latest salvo against Harvard may have multiple objectives, the travel ban proclamation has one primary goal.

But this year was different.', 'Alan Garber, the president of Harvard University, received a standing ovation and welcomed graduates “from down the street, across the country and around the world”, drawing applause for the last words: “Around the world – just as it should be.”', 'It was a nod, subtle but firm, to the international students who are part of the lifeblood of Harvard but now a target for Donald Trump: his administration is seeking to revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll students from overseas. It is just one front in an escalating battle between a US president with authoritarian ambitions and the country’s oldest, wealthiest and most prestigious university.', 'Since taking office more than four months ago, Trump has used executive power to take aim at Congress, law firms, media organisations, cultural institutions and leading universities. Some have resisted but many have capitulated. In Harvard, the man who urged his supporters to “fight, fight, fight” faces a resilient foe unlike any he has taken on before.', 'Its emergence as a bulwark of the opposition to Trump was summed up by this year’s Class Day speaker at Harvard, the former basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: “After seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the US constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom.”', 'Harvard was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1636, a century and a half before the nation itself. Its alumni include the former presidents John F Kennedy and Barack Obama, supreme court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, tech entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, actors Matt Damon and Natalie Portman and writer Margaret Atwood.', 'Now it is in Trump’s crosshairs. The administration claims its actions are aimed at tackling issues such as antisemitism on campus, discrimination – particularly against white, Asian, male and straight individuals – foreign influence from China, and perceived “woke” or “leftist” ideology in academia.', 'The administration launched its offensive in April, sending a letter to Harvard demanding that it make far-reaching changes in how it operates. The list included external audits of campus viewpoints, achieving “viewpoint diversity” as determined by the government and potentially terminating certain programmes.', 'Garber publicly rejected the demands, stating they amounted to ceding control of the university to the government and were an unconstitutional attack on academic freedom.', 'Within hours, the Trump administration announced it was freezing more than $2bn in federal contracts and grants with Harvard, which mostly fund scientific and medical research. This has since risen to a total of $3bn. Harvard is fighting the funding cuts in court.', 'In May, Trump turned the screws further. He said he was considering taking previously awarded grant money for scientific and engineering research away and giving it to trade schools. The White House urged federal agencies to cancel any remaining contracts with Harvard, worth an estimated $100m.', 'The administration also announced that it would revoke Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and force current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal immigration status. In a chilling statement, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”', 'More than a quarter of Harvard’s students come from outside the US and serve as a vital revenue source at the Ivy League school. Critics warned that Trump’s actions would represent a spectacular own goal, driving the world’s best talents away from the US and into the arms of its competitors.', 'Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, wrote on Substack: “Had Trump’s anti-foreign student policies been in place decades ago, Oxford grad Elon Musk would have built Tesla in the United Kingdom, Tsinghua University alum Jensen Huang would have built Nvidia in the People’s Republic of China or Taiwan, and Moscow State University grad Sergei Brin would have built Google in Russia.”', 'Harvard sued the administration and won an emergency block on the action. This week, a judge said she would extend the order as the two sides continue to thrash it out in court.', 'Trump is also using the tax system as a cudgel. Most universities, including Harvard, are exempt from federal income tax because they are deemed to be charitable organisations operated exclusively for public educational purposes. The administration is now threatening Harvard’s tax-exempt status, which experts say saves the school hundreds of millions of dollars each year.', 'Trump’s huge spending bill before Congress would drastically hike taxes that Harvard and other elite schools pay on the profits their massive endowment investments make. Critics say that would weaken the ability of Harvard and other rich schools to provide generous financial aid packages to poorer students.', 'What are the White House’s motives? Some observers detect the hand of JD Vance and the deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. In 2022, Vance told Vanity Fair magazine: “I tend to think that we should seize the institutions of the left and turn them against the left. We need like a de-Baathification programme, a de-woke-ification programme.”', 'And on Thursday, Miller told Fox News: “Harvard has engaged in decades of invidious, unlawful and illegal race-based discrimination against American citizens ... The Democrat party’s philosophy right now is for foreigners, everything – for Americans, nothing.”', 'Jason Johnson, a political scientist at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, said: “Their goal is to intimidate and break down institutions of higher learning in America because that is where most of the resistance to their authoritarian tendencies is going to come from.', '“They figure, if we can bankrupt Harvard, if we can embarrass Harvard, if we can put Harvard in a position of weakness or at least get them to bend the knee, then all the other institutions in America will follow. That’s why they’re doing this.”', 'Johnson warned: “Trump is not going to meet his match because he has the entire resources of the federal government at his disposal. Regardless of what Harvard does, there will be other universities who simply see the attack and comply in advance, and that ultimately would still be a victory for the Trump administration.”', 'Other commentators detect an element of class warfare. Trump won election last November with a base drawing largely on non-college-educated white men. Now he is stoking hostility towards the ivory towers of the US’s most elite university.', 'Brendan Boyle, a Democratic representative who graduated from Harvard in 2005, said: “Part of Trump’s political skill is figuring out how to portray himself as this working man’s populist hero even though he’s a billionaire who pisses in gold toilets.', '“Beating up on Harvard will probably help him among some in his base, but I do think most Americans recognize this for what it is: an attempted government takeover of higher education. That’s something that should actually worry all of us.”', 'The onslaught against Harvard is typical of an administration that, in its opening weeks, sought to overwhelm opponents with shock and awe. Columbia University made sweeping concessions, hoping to claw back $400m of withdrawn federal grants.', 'But Harvard’s substantial $53bn endowment provides it with greater capacity to withstand pressure and engage in legal battles compared with less well-endowed institutions. It has refused to buckle to Trump’s demands. Instead, it has challenged the administration’s actions in court and achieved some temporary victories.', 'Boyle, who spoke with Harvard’s Garber recently, said: “I personally expressed to him how proud I am to see Harvard standing up and not backing down from this fight the way, unfortunately, some other universities had backed down. In standing up to this administration, Harvard is waging a battle not just for the future of Harvard but for the future of American higher education.”', 'Asked whether he was confident that Harvard will win, Boyle replied: “Harvard has been around for hundreds of years before Donald Trump and it will be around for hundreds of years after Donald Trump.”', 'Trump has long styled himself as a fighter. He waged legal battles during his business career. He has feuded with celebrities ranging from Rosie O’Donnell to Taylor Swift to Bruce Springsteen. He has railed against media outlets such as CNN and the New York Times. In the political arena, he took on the entire Republican party establishment and won. He also waged bitter campaigns against Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.', 'But both Trump’s first and second presidential terms have run afoul of a robust judiciary finding many of his actions unconstitutional. This week, a federal court blocked him from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. He won a temporary reprieve from an appeals court a day later but his signature set of economic policies remains in doubt.', 'Academics at Harvard trust that the rule of law will prevail in their own case. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law emeritus, said: “I think we’re going to win the battle in the courts. These are open-and-shut cases.', '“In fact, in the federal courts in the month of May, there were a lot of battles involving Trump against various individuals and institutions, and you know what his record was? He lost 96% of them. The percentage that he lost was not very different depending on which president appointed the judge, because these are easy legal questions.”', 'Holding firm is crucial, Tribe believes, because Trump is trying to pick off universities one by one, just as he did with law firms. At stake is a stand against authoritarianism and the hope that courage will be contagious.', '“If they can’t control the university, they want to disband it because the first thought of a tyrant is to suppress the power of reason and the citadel of freedom,” Tribe said. “That is the university. It’s been true since the Middle Ages. Harvard has an emblematic significance that makes it stick in Donald Trump’s craw. Its motto ‘veritas’ must irritate the hell out of him because truth is his enemy.”']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNUtSVEIxVUd0alNFeG1RbWhvVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdrUkFJem5EV3dHVHdF=-w280-h168-p-df

Some 4,000 student workers represented by unions at Harvard who would be impacted.', '“The Trump’s administration’s threat to international scholars is a huge attack on thousands of UAW-represented workers on Harvard’s campus. We are seeing escalations against immigrant workers across the country and this is no different,” said the director of the United Auto Workers Region 9A, Brandon Mancilla. “The labor movement must see these attacks as what they are – an attempt to divide workers and create false enemies in a time of rampant corporate greed.”', 'Sudipta Saha, a fourth-year PhD candidate in population health sciences at Harvard who holds citizenship with Canada and Bangladesh, and is a member of the executive board of the Harvard Graduate Students Union, explained the fears the move has instilled in international student workers on campus who are worried about their visa status, education and research.', '“Even if Harvard wins this particular case, the broader authoritarian turn that this represents is still being successful, because a lot of people are worried about whether they can actually speak out,” said Saha. “International students who have been asking me, have been asking each other, is it safe to go on the record? Is it safe to even write an op ed? And I think when people are asking questions like that, that kind of shows how already, how successful this kind of crackdown has been.”', '“We do a lot of vital work.

An Update on Supporting Our International Students and Scholars,https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/an-update-on-supporting-our-international-students-and-scholars-2/,"['Dear Members of the Harvard Community,\n \nLast night, the White House issued a proclamation suspending entry to the United States for any international student studying at Harvard University on an F or J visa. Singling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard.\n \nAs you know, we recently obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining the Administration’s illegal revocation of Harvard’s Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) certification. Last night’s proclamation circumvents that court order. Today, we have amended our lawsuit and will ask the court to immediately halt the enforcement of the proclamation. We hope the court will act swiftly.\n \nWhile the court considers our request, contingency plans are being developed to ensure that international students and scholars can continue to pursue their work at Harvard this summer and through the coming academic year. School leadership will provide updates on this planning. In addition, the Harvard International Office will be in touch directly with students and scholars who may be affected by the proclamation, also issued last night, banning travel of citizens from certain countries to the United States.\n \nEach of us is part of a truly global university community. We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable. International students and scholars make outstanding contributions inside and outside of our classrooms and laboratories, fulfilling our mission of excellence in countless ways. We will celebrate them, support them, and defend their interests as we continue to assert our Constitutional rights.\n \nSincerely,\nAlan M.
