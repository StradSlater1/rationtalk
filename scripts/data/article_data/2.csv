Tensions escalated further after President Donald Trump said he would deploy 2,000 California National Guard troops to the city—over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom.', 'The unrest was initially sparked by an ICE raid outside a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District, where federal officials alleged the employer used fictitious documents for workers.', 'As ICE agents conducted arrests, protesters attempted to block their vehicles and later gathered at a downtown federal building, where they believed detainees were being held. Protests quickly spread to Paramount and Compton, where additional operations were reportedly underway.', 'The president ordered the National Guard to operate under federal command to ""address the lawlessness,"" bypassing the traditional authority of the state\'s governor. The troops were tasked with supporting ICE operations rather than engaging in direct law enforcement, though their presence on city streets has added to the confrontational atmosphere around protest sites.', 'Some groups within the crowd set fire to property and defaced vehicles, including multiple autonomous Waymo cars, which were torched near Pershing Square, their windows smashed and exteriors spray-painted. Protesters also surrounded and defaced a KTLA news van.', 'Videos and photographs showed tear gas deployed outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, where federal troops faced off with protesters on Sunday.', 'The chaos marked one of the most forceful uses of National Guard troops in a major U.S. city in recent years, highlighting the widening rift between federal and state leadership over immigration policy and protest management.', 'The Trump administration defended its immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles, which it said was aimed at detaining undocumented individuals with outstanding deportation orders or criminal records. ICE confirmed a multi-day, citywide sweep involving tactical teams that began late Thursday.', ""In his deployment of the National Guard, Trump has overridden Governor Newsom, who would typically retain authority over California's troops under standard protocols."", '""If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can\'t do their jobs, which everyone knows they can\'t, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!"" the president wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.', 'City leaders have warned that further protests may follow.

How burning Waymos became the image of the LA protests,https://www.theverge.com/google-waymo/682932/la-protest-waymo-fire-destroy-ice-police,"['For supporters of the protests, the robotaxis are a surveillance risk. To the right wing and even some liberals, their destruction is evidence of violence.', '', 'Is there a more potent image from the current anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles than a row of driverless Waymo vehicles covered in anti-ICE slogans and engulfed in flames?', 'At least five Waymos were destroyed during the protests over the weekend, CNN reports. And the company tells us that it has suspended its service in certain parts of the city under direction from the Los Angeles Police Department.', 'As we’ve seen before, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles have a way of turning into collateral damage during times of civil unrest. They are often sitting ducks, lacking an innate ability to avoid the scene or flee when surrounded by a group of people. Unlike Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they won’t run over protesters who stand in their way — their programming forbids it. And their presence likely adds fuel to a volatile situation, where protests against ICE and billionaire oligarchs are in coexistence. Waymo insists the protests aren’t related to its service, but it seems clear the robotaxis represent a change that a lot of people are unhappy about.', 'While the protesters aren’t rallying in opposition to the Alphabet-owned company, others watching from afar can’t help but draw some conclusions about the tech industry in general’s role in society today.', 'Critics note that Waymo’s robotaxis are festooned with cameras, which they use to perceive their environment and detect obstacles. But the cameras are also recording their surrounding environment and storing the footage. The company has been known to share that footage with law enforcement agencies, including the LAPD, when requested or subpoenaed. So it makes sense, these critics theorize, that protesters who are worried about their identities being revealed by rolling “surveillance devices” would seek to destroy them.', 'Waymo is a project of Google, whose CEO, Sundar Pichai, attended Donald Trump’s inauguration. And the company’s effort to replace human drivers with robots is a threat to blue-collar jobs — to say nothing of its work on AI and all the societal implications on labor and education that entails.', 'The destruction underscores a serious obstacle to Waymo’s future. By all accounts, most people in Los Angeles like the driverless cars. LA hasn’t experienced the same fierce objections to Waymo as San Francisco. Most of the time, the company has an incredible ability to coast on good vibes and customer delight. The novelty is powerful, and Waymo’s ability to avoid most dangerous situations, while other autonomous vehicle companies have been less lucky, has helped propel it to the front of the pack in the robotaxi race.', 'But some residents still feel left out of the technological revolution, and those feelings are laid bare during civil unrest like what’s unfolding in LA. They see the gleaming, futuristic robots rolling down the street, with their spinning sensors and all-seeing cameras, and they ask, Why? Did they consent to taking part in an experiment by Big Tech to see if robots can be trained to be better drivers than humans? Will this serve their communities? They point to the examples of blocked intersections, low-speed collisions with pedestrians or cyclists, or minor traffic infractions, and they ask whether this technology is really as ready as the company claims.', 'The burning Waymos rankle plenty of people, too, even those who support the cause of the protesters. Liberals, especially, often decry the destruction of property and worry that the images of flaming vehicles fuel the right-wing narrative about “lawless cities” and “radicals” or “paid protesters” facing off with law enforcement officers just trying to do their jobs. And they urge protesters to avoid falling into the trap that the right has set for them.', 'The burning Waymos rankle plenty of people, too.', 'But of course, it’s never so simple. If Waymo continues to expand to new cities, it will naturally come into conflict with protests, just as it does with street festivals, sports victories, and other situations in which the destruction of property is occasionally the unintended outcome. And if the company continues to cooperate with law enforcement, it may find itself increasingly at odds with communities that distrust these agents of the state.', '“Safety is our highest priority,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in an email. “We removed vehicles from Downtown Los Angeles and will not be serving that specific area for the time being, out of an abundance of caution and with guidance from LAPD.”', 'The company’s mission is to become the world’s “most trusted driver” by making transportation safer and more accessible. And there are cases when Waymo releasing footage to law enforcement can be helpful, like when one of its vehicles witnesses a hit-and-run. But as the company becomes a bigger part of city life, it will inevitably come into conflict with all the many forces that are currently roiling our country. And that’s something that not even the world’s most trusted driver can avoid.', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

No title found,https://www.thefp.com/p/la-riots-protests-illegal-immigration-trump,"['LOS ANGELES — About three hours into the third day of the immigration protests in downtown Los Angeles, a dozen or so protesters started breaking up large rocks lining the gap between the street and an off-ramp and hurling them onto the 101 Freeway below. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) had closed the southbound side after protesters had tried to seize it. Police cars and SUVs were parked there, and they were getting pummeled by the rocks. As one officer drove away, a rock smashed the police car’s windshield. (You can watch some of this scene in a video by The Free Press’s Austyn Jeffs here.)', 'This went on for at least an hour. I didn’t see anyone get arrested.', 'When one of the rock-throwing protesters saw me taking pictures, he ordered me to delete the ones that showed anyone who was unmasked. “We’ll fuck you up,” he threatened. I deleted them; he gave me a fist bump.', 'Rocks weren’t the only projectiles. I saw protesters tossing commercial-grade fireworks at the police, which sounded like bombs. Between the fireworks and the flash-bangs, there was a concussive explosion about once a minute.', 'I have been to dozens of mass protests like the one that exploded in Los Angeles on Friday. What I saw in Los Angeles on Sunday was different. It felt like it could be the prelude to something even worse.', 'Even before the rocks started flying, the police were responding to protesters who were throwing benign projectiles like empty plastic water bottles by firing rubber bullets and flash-bangs directly at them.', '“They were shooting randomly,” said protester Louis Gallardo from Dallas, showing me a massive welt on his rib cage from being struck by a rubber bullet. He said the police pulled a woman he was with out of the crowd and arrested her.', 'A man I spoke to pointed out that those rocks were big enough to kill people. They were.', 'What I saw didn’t seem random at all. CHP officers were methodically picking out targets through their gun scopes and firing less-lethal munitions at them.', 'When I arrived downtown late Sunday afternoon, tens of thousands of protesters occupied about eight square blocks above the closed 101 Freeway. Helicopters soared overhead. A Waymo in a line of Waymo taxis was engulfed in bonfire-size flames, a massive plume of black smoke clogging the sky above it. The others were smashed and covered in graffiti. Within an hour, they would all be on fire.', '“I’m not really into politics,” Daniel Flores, a young protester from Los Angeles, told me. “But in this situation, it affects my family, and it affects everyone that I love. So I have to get involved somehow.”', 'The usual choreography of these protests goes something like this: Thousands of normal people show up, along with a smaller contingent of organized agitators. The agitators engage in enough petty property damage to create a situation in which there is a standoff with the cops. Under the cover of the crowd, they then engage in more serious property destruction. If they are emboldened enough, these agitators might launch some largely symbolic attacks on police lines: throwing trash, vandalizing an unattended police cruiser, that kind of thing.', 'If the strategy is successful, it provokes a violent reaction from the police that is directed at the general mass of protesters. The experience of being attacked by the police when you haven’t done anything illegal outrages the nonviolent majority of the crowd, which then becomes incrementally more violent in return. The situation escalates.', 'Sunday did not follow that script.', 'Though the rock-throwing protesters were masked, they did not have the telltale signs of being antifa types. They weren’t clad in black with anarchist patches safety-pinned to their hoodies. They carried no flags or shields. They were not predominantly white.', 'They also weren’t incrementally ratcheting up their activity. They had escalated straight into serious violence.', 'Several protesters I spoke to were strongly opposed to the rock-throwing. One woman cursed out a man who had thrown some kind of smoke canister at the police below. A man I spoke to pointed out that those rocks were big enough to kill people. They were.', 'Late in the afternoon, police reopened the northbound side of the 101. While protesters and cops hurled rocks and fired munitions at one another, civilian traffic zoomed by on the opposite side. There was an endless cascade of honks in support of the protesters. It is quite obvious that the public here deplores the recent immigration raids. But it seemed like only dumb luck that one of the rocks or fireworks didn’t land in the honking traffic.', 'The right is describing the protests as a violent “insurrection.” The left wants to portray them as largely peaceful. Many in the middle might assume that both portrayals are correct: Generally peaceful demonstrations are being hijacked by extremists and criminal elements.', 'The immigrant communities here, legal and illegal, generally are not seen as an occupying army of foreigners. They are largely taken for granted by most Californians as part of the social fabric.', 'The reality is that no protest is ever just one thing. I saw people who aimed to injure or even kill police officers, and who would have been happy to instigate massive civil unrest. This faction seemed to be outnumbered, though, by those who looked at what they were doing with disapproval but were powerless to stop it.', 'While I saw only a small sliver of what has happened across Los Angeles during the past four days, almost all of the people I spoke to told me they are angry and scared about the raids. “What is he doing sending ICE out into elementary schools?” a woman who said her first name was Dulca asked me about President Trump.', '“I’m seeing lots of people my age out here protesting for their parents,” Ignacio Vazquez, a 30-year-old amateur photographer who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, told me.', 'I have lived in California for more or less my entire life. I have covered immigration here. Despite the national outrage over mass illegal immigration during the Biden presidency, things do not feel noticeably different in Los Angeles or the Bay Area from how they have for decades. The immigrant communities here, legal and illegal, generally are not seen as an occupying army of foreigners. They are largely taken for granted by most Californians as part of the social fabric, no more alien than people who moved here from the East Coast.', 'The demonstrations are ugly, but so is what precipitated them. I asked Dulca what it feels like to live in Los Angeles these days. I expected her to say she was terrified, but instead she pointed to the protests. “Everyone in L.A. is coming together,” she said.\n\nThat may be true.

What we know about the tactics used in the Los Angeles protests,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/us/law-enforcement-los-angeles-protests-tactics,"['A relative state of calm in Los Angeles began to crumble early Sunday afternoon as demonstrators confronted federal authorities guarding a downtown detention facility where chaos erupted as National Guard soldiers deployed tear gas on an increasingly agitated crowd.', 'An already tense situation began to escalate as a line of troops sent in by President Donald Trump the previous night – against the will of state officials –started forming what’s called a “skirmish line” around 1 p.m. The troops used riot shields to push the crowd back to make way for a convoy of approaching law enforcement vehicles.', 'The soldiers were heavily armed, carrying standard-use M4 military rifles affixed with magazines, suggesting they were loaded with ammunition. Such weaponry in the hands of military personnel on the streets of an American city is rare, as is the use of the armed forces to conduct crowd control.', 'In an apparent response to a member of the crowd lobbing an object at authorities, the National Guard and US Homeland Security agents fired less lethal projectiles and deployed tear gas on the group.', 'A large number of Los Angeles Police Department officers in riot gear arrived as the crowd continued to build and began dispersing people, moving them away from the federal jail. Unlike much of the US military, LAPD officers receive extensive training in crowd control techniques – tactics officers were called upon to use during social unrest in the city following George Floyd’s death in 2020.', 'The effort, however, became a new flashpoint as certain hostile demonstrators threw bottles and other items at officers, who responded by swinging their batons and striking some members of the crowd.', 'The protests had begun Friday night in response to federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, which come amid Trump’s larger crackdown involving raids and deportations across the country.', 'The LAPD announced dispersal orders and issued a citywide “tactical alert,” putting the entire police department on standby for possible deployment.', 'During a tactical alert, officers currently on duty must remain on shift until relieved by their commanders, and certain calls for service from the public may not be addressed until the alert is lifted.', 'In one shocking moment, a motorcyclist plowed into a line of LAPD officers, injuring at least two of them, authorities said. The rider was quickly swarmed by a half dozen cops and arrested.', 'It ranked among the most extreme incidents of violence witnessed Sunday.', 'While teams of officers continued to push back crowds around the downtown area, there were additional clashes – including some violent agitators firing what the city’s police chief described as “commercial-grade fireworks” at authorities.', 'As a group of mounted patrol officers surrounded a protester on the ground, a barrage of fireworks appeared to suddenly startle one of the horses, seen on video trampling the man. Another horse-mounted officer then struck the man with a stick.', 'The video appears to show officers in a chaotic situation employing contradictory police tactics on the same person, which can often lead to confusion or dangerous outcomes. While one officer appeared to order the man to stand up and leave, the man was quickly tackled by another officer after standing.', 'It is unclear from the video what happened before the incident, the reason officers initially surrounded him and whether he was ultimately arrested.', 'Experts say the use of horses to patrol protests does come with numerous benefits to officers. The height of the animal provides a mounted officer with a vantage point to look over and into large crowds. The imposing size of a horse can also have a psychological effect in dissuading potential violence.', 'Beyond the demonstrators protesting the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, vandals struck the downtown area as the afternoon continued. Building and vehicle windows were shattered and graffiti was sprayed. Multiple self-driving Waymo cars were also vandalized and set ablaze.', 'Around 4 p.m., groups of demonstrators moved from the city streets to the lanes of the busy 101 Freeway, bringing traffic to a halt. Several dozen officers from the California Highway Patrol responded to clear people from the freeway, while some violent demonstrators on an overpass hurled objects such as scooters and rocks at CHP officers, smashing the windows and damaging several police cruisers.', 'At one point, a man on an overpass dropped a lit object onto the hood of one of the CHP vehicles, attempting to set it on fire. Officers taking refuge under the bridge responded with fire extinguishers to douse the flames.', 'The 101 Freeway incident showed instances of law enforcement trying to deescalate a chaotic situation rather than ratcheting up tensions with overwhelming force. For example, rather than bringing in teams of officers to surround and confront the demonstrators destroying property from atop the bridge, authorities appeared to wait them out.', 'Officials have warned police will continue to review video taken at the scene in order to bring charges against those allegedly responsible for assault and damage.', 'Additionally, officers clearing the freeway of demonstrators appeared to try to slow down the situation and remove people in groups, even as some isolated skirmishes occurred. A tactic known as an “L-formation,” in which officers align themselves in the shape of the letter, created a natural path of movement for the demonstrators police were trying to direct off the highway.', 'Shortly after 9 p.m., LAPD declared the entirety of downtown Los Angeles an unlawful assembly, and worked for several hours to disperse crowds ignoring the order.', 'Authorities said dozens of people were arrested in Los Angeles as part of Sunday’s unrest.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Thermal Runaway Explains Why Waymo Cars Burned So Completely in the Recent Los Angeles Protests,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-waymo-car-fires-in-recent-los-angeles-protests-caused-the-robotaxis/,"['JUNE 9, 2025', '4 MIN READ', 'Thermal Runaway Explains Why Waymo Cars Burned So Completely in the Recent Los Angeles Protests', 'During recent protests in Los Angeles, fires triggered “thermal runaway” in several Waymo robotaxis’ lithium-ion battery packs. The phenomenon sent temperatures past 1,000 degrees Celsius, vaporized much of the cars and spewed lung-searing hydrogen fluoride', 'BY DENI ELLIS BÉCHARD EDITED BY DEAN VISSER', 'A Waymo vehicle burns in the middle of an intersection during protests in Los Angeles, California, on June 8, 2025.', 'David Pashaee/Middle East Images via AFP', 'Imagine watching a car burn until it seems to vaporize and the street itself begins to sag. That happened on Sunday in Los Angeles, when protesters torched at least five Waymo-branded Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis. When the smoke cleared, virtually the entire shell of each car—its roof, doors, hood, trunk and body panels—was gone, leaving only wheel rims and traces of aluminum lacing.', 'Why did the fires cause such obliteration? The answer starts with the battery. Each I-Pace can carry roughly 90 kilowatt-hours of stored chemical energy, comparable to about 170 pounds (77 kilograms) of TNT. That energy is distributed across hundreds of lithium-ion pouch cells, which are sealed in flammable electrolyte and separated by polymer films as thin as snack-bag plastic. When any one cell is punctured or overheated—or set aflame with an incendiary device—chemical reactions generate more heat than the cell can shed, and neighboring cells follow in a chain reaction. This positive-feedback loop is called “thermal runaway.” According to a 2024 study in the Journal of Power Sources, as the battery burns, its temperature can soar past 1,000 degrees Celsius.', 'At that point, the pack becomes its own furnace. Aluminum sections of the car’s floor surrender, liquefying at about 660 degrees C and taking the underbody with them. Magnesium parts—seat-base frames, the bracket that holds the steering column and the cross-car beam that is located behind the dashboard—flare bright white. Patches of magnesium can catch fire and burn fiercely. Plastics disappear as vapor, wheels lose their tire, and even the lidar mast on the roof quickly resembles an overcooked marshmallow. A 2025 study in Fire Technology and a 2023 study in Applied Energy noted that the placement of the battery on the floor—sometimes referred to as a “skateboard architecture”—makes the floor the hottest zone. Thus, flames radiate upward and outward, cooking everything above.', 'All the while, the battery cells vent hydrogen fluoride, a toxic, lung-searing gas documented in laboratory test burns of commercial lithium packs. Among the disturbing scenes from the recent Los Angeles protests, which erupted over federal immigration raids, are those in which protestors stood around the flaming Waymos. Historically, first responders without supplied-air protection have developed throat burns and breathing difficulties upon arriving at scenes with burning lithium-ion batteries. Depending on the hydrogen fluoride levels, an exposed person can begin coughing up blood within minutes. Whereas inhaling concentrations above roughly 30 parts per million (ppm) is immediately dangerous to health, 50 ppm may be fatal when inhaled for a half-hour to an hour, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that exposure to 170 ppm for 10 minutes can be deadly. Measurements taken near electric-vehicle (EV) fires show peaks of 150 to 450 ppm, with levels during much of the fire hovering around 50 ppm.', 'Firefighters call such blazes “battery box fires,” and they hate them. Flame-retardant foams do little, and fire departments now favor high-pressure water lances or immersion pits. Dousing a runaway battery usually means lowering temperatures below the runaway threshold for every last battery cell—a task that, according to a 2021 interview with Thayer Smith of the Austin Fire Department, can swallow 30,000 to 40,000 gallons (about 114,000 to 151,000 liters) of water. That’s at least 40 times the amount of water required to extinguish a gasoline-car fire. If you hit the flames too lightly, stranded energy reignites hours later—a quirk the National Transportation Safety Board flagged in its 2020 report on EV firefighting hazards.', 'Car designers have tried to address the danger. Software monitors cell temperatures and slows the rate at which batteries charge to prevent overheating. And it automatically cuts current if anything looks amiss. Yet even the best code cannot rewrite chemistry: in 2023 Jaguar recalled more than 6,400 I-Pace cars after at least a dozen of them caught fire from overheated batteries—which had likely shorted from manufacturing defects in their pouch cells. Six of the fires happened while the car was either plugged in or within a few minutes of being unplugged. Waymo’s fleet got the update to better regulate the batteries, but software can’t help when someone smashes one of the car’s windows and lights up its interior with a “makeshift flamethrower,” as reported by the Los Angeles Times.', 'Could a Waymo van have burned just as thoroughly? Only with great effort. The company’s earlier Chrysler Pacifica hybrids, which were phased out in 2023, stored a tenth of their battery energy in a steel-framed shell. Steel keeps its shape beyond 1,300 degrees C, so after a typical blaze, you would still recognize the carcass. To prevent thermal runaway, Teslas have batteries that use thousands of small cylindrical cells locked inside an aluminum tray with titanium undershields and built-in firebreaks. And most brands of electric-car batteries now sit in similarly rigid aluminum or steel boxes—and are shifting toward less volatile chemistries.', 'Importantly, however, the scene in Los Angeles by no means indicates that electric cars are tinderboxes. A 2023 study in Finland showed that, mile for mile, they caught fire less often than gasoline cars. But when an EV does burn, the physics shift. You’re no longer fighting a puddle of gasoline on asphalt; you’re battling an energy-dense, metal-oxide battery that is determined to finish what it started—and in such cases, a single Molotov cocktail can turn a sleek robotaxi into a pool of molten alloy.', 'DENI ELLIS BÉCHARD is Scientific American’s senior tech reporter.

The Dangerous Truth About the ‘Nonlethal’ Weapons Used Against LA Protesters,https://www.wired.com/story/non-lethal-weapons-la-protests/,"[""IN A STORMY weekend for US domestic politics, police and the National Guard arrested at least 56 people demonstrating in Los Angeles, California. On Friday, June 6, several groups took to the streets to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, which have grown in intensity and number over the past few months. According to CBS News, ICE recorded more than 2,000 arrests per day during Tuesday and Wednesday of the first week of June alone, a considerable increase when compared to the average of 660 that occurred in the first 100 days of Donald Trump's second administration."", ""The use of the National Guard to address a local situation like the protests in Los Angeles raised alarms from California governor Gavin Newsom, who accused the Trump administration of “creating a crisis.” Meanwhile, other civil society groups condemned the state response against protesters. “President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against recent ICE raids is deeply alarming,” Amnesty International wrote. “Armed troops have no place in our neighborhoods. This is not about protecting communities, but about suppressing dissent and instilling fear.”"", ""During the scenes, protesters came face-to-face with National Guard and Los Angeles Sheriff's Office police officers. Both bodies were equipped with “nonlethal” weapons to disperse the protests. Among these devices are believed to be the PGL-65 (or P540) or the 37mm or 40mm Sage Deuce Projectile Launcher, “less lethal” ammunition launchers that law enforcement agencies have in their repertoire. Weapons such as those mentioned can launch tear gas grenades with a maximum range of nearly 500 feet. They can also fire kinetic impact grenades (rubber ammunition), “less lethal” fragmentation grenades (rubber balls that scatter when the munition explodes), stun grenades (explosions that cause loud noises and lights to disorient), and paint marker grenades (to mark demonstrators). According to media outlets such as CNN, police in Los Angeles have used stun guns and tear gas to disperse protesters."", ""Canada prohibits the use of these “nonlethal weapons” for demonstration control. Canada's Firearms Regulations (SOR/2020-96 and SOR/98-462) include the PGL-65, Sage Deuce, and other equivalent models within the category of banned weapons. The statute restricts the use of “Any firearm with a (bore bore) diameter of 20 mm or more” (except those designed exclusively to neutralize explosive devices) under the “regulations establishing certain firearms and other weapons, components and parts of weapons, accessories, cartridge magazines, ammunition and projectiles as prohibited or restricted.”"", 'Although Canada is among the few countries that explicitly prohibit the PGL-65, civil society organizations discourage its use and warn about the potential dangers of this launcher.', 'The Los Angeles police force also uses another “less lethal” projectile launcher against protesters. WIRED was able to verify that this weapon matches the Defense Technology 40mm Single-Shot Launcher (model 1325 or similar), which in this case is painted green to distinguish its “anti-riot” application. A video from the Australian site 9News shows how one of these police officers shot an Australian journalist with what was reportedly a rubber bullet. This weapon appears in other images that media and citizens have documented during the protests.', 'Riot police in Los Angeles fire a 40mm LMT weapon from Defense Technology, which is banned by Canada.', 'Under the Geneva conventions, the “recommendations” for the application of kinetic projectiles (such as the Model 1325) discourage police from aiming at protesters’ faces, as they could result in “skull fractures and brain damage, eye damage (including permanent blindness) and even death.” The use of kinetic projectiles from an elevated area, such as at a protest, can increase the risk of protesters being shot in the head. Targeting the torso can cause damage to vital organs and result in body penetration, especially when fired at close range. The caliber and velocity of the projectile, as well as the material from which they are made, will also influence the seriousness of the injury.', 'In addition, the Geneva conventions specify the circumstances of possible illegal uses of these weapons and lay down the rules:', 'The vast majority of countries keep confidential the specific name of the models they use to deter protests. Some governments, for example, register purchases under generic designations, such as “40 mm launchers,” without citing the make or model, making accountability and verification of the illegal use of these devices difficult.', 'For example, in Mexico, the Secretariat of National Defense launched tender LA-007000999-E818-2022 in November 2022 for the purchase of 70,000 long- and short-range 40-mm caliber gas projectiles, along with smoke ammunition and liquid marking, according to El Universal. The specifications do not show brands or models of the launcher or manufacturers.', 'Only countries, such as Canada, include the makes and models of their “nonlethal” weapons. Similar records do not exist in Mexico or Latin America.', 'The application of weapons such as the Penn Arms GL-1 or similar, as well as the Defense Technology 1325, is seen in social protests, often documented by Amnesty International, which accuses them of abusive use against peaceful civilians. And, while touted as “less lethal,” they can cause serious injuries and human rights violations. In addition, the organization, in its 2023 report “My Eye Exploded,” demands that the use of 40-mm gas or impact projectiles against peaceful civilians be suspended.', ""According to an assessment by Chile's National Human Rights Institute, police actions during the protests that began in October 2019 resulted in more than 440 eye injuries, with more than 30 cases of eye loss or eye rupture."", 'This story was originally published on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.', 'In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear', '“Wi-Fi keeps going down”: Trump’s RTO mandate is going terribly', 'Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack', 'Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence”', 'Uncanny Valley: An insider look at the influence of Silicon Valley', 'MORE FROM WIRED', 'REVIEWS AND GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

Such weaponry in the hands of military personnel on the streets of an American city is rare, as is the use of the armed forces to conduct crowd control.', 'In an apparent response to a member of the crowd lobbing an object at authorities, the National Guard and US Homeland Security agents fired less lethal projectiles and deployed tear gas on the group.', 'A large number of Los Angeles Police Department officers in riot gear arrived as the crowd continued to build and began dispersing people, moving them away from the federal jail. Unlike much of the US military, LAPD officers receive extensive training in crowd control techniques – tactics officers were called upon to use during social unrest in the city following George Floyd’s death in 2020.', 'The effort, however, became a new flashpoint as certain hostile demonstrators threw bottles and other items at officers, who responded by swinging their batons and striking some members of the crowd.', 'The protests had begun Friday night in response to federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, which come amid Trump’s larger crackdown involving raids and deportations across the country.', 'The LAPD announced dispersal orders and issued a citywide “tactical alert,” putting the entire police department on standby for possible deployment.', 'During a tactical alert, officers currently on duty must remain on shift until relieved by their commanders, and certain calls for service from the public may not be addressed until the alert is lifted.', 'In one shocking moment, a motorcyclist plowed into a line of LAPD officers, injuring at least two of them, authorities said.

Why burning EVs isn't a good idea.,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/09/burning-waymos-la-protests-safety-risk/84115759007/,"[""Multiple Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire in Los Angeles during protests there. Other cars were also put to the torch but the Waymos have garnered special interest, partially because they're something new on the scene and partially because as electric vehicles, they raise different and specific concerns if their batteries burn."", ""Here's what we know and what experts worry about."", 'From social media and photos, it appears that at least five Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire on Sunday, June 8 amidst immigration protests in downtown Los Angeles.', 'Protesters smashed windows on the cars – all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs – as well as spray painting them with anti-ICE and anti-Trump slogans. Some were also set on fire.', 'The burning cars, whose base sticker price is $73,000, according to Car and Driver, sent plumes of thick black smoke billowing into the blue Los Angeles sky, making for stunning photos that have figured prominently in many media feeds about the protests.', 'Waymo has suspended service to the affected area of downtown Los Angeles.', 'A Waymo spokesperson told USA TODAY on Monday morning, June 9, the company has removed its vehicles from downtown Los Angeles and is currently not serving the area ""out of an abundance of caution.""', 'The spokesperson said the company is still operating in Los Angeles, which covers 500 square miles, and is working in coordination with the Los Angeles Police Department.', 'In San Francisco, where three separate protests are planned for Monday, June 9, Waymo told USA TODAY while the company was still operating and serving riders in San Francisco, it is currently limiting trips in certain areas where protesters may be gathering.', ""Waymo are available for rides in Austin, Phoenix, Los Angeles, parts of Silicon Valley and all of San Francisco. They're expected to start in Atlanta, Miami and Washington in 2026. In April the company announced its first foreign venture, with testing beginning in Tokyo."", 'According to the company, more than 250,000 trips a week are taken in its driverless robotaxis.', 'Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.', ""It's not clear if the Los Angeles protesters were specifically targeting Waymos or if the cars just happened to wander into the area and because they have no drivers, they were perceived as more vulnerable or they simply didn't know to drive away."", 'The Waymos that burned all appeared to be empty, meaning no passengers were potentially at risk.', ""There have been suggestions online that protesters might have called Waymos to the area specifically to set them on fire. However that would mean Waymo would know the name and contact info of the people who'd called them, making the scenario less likely though certainly not impossible. Waymo would not say how its cars came to be in the area."", ""There have also been suggestions that the Waymos were targeted because they are festooned with cameras, meaning they might be used to identify protesters engaging in illegal activity. However many modern cars are equipped with cameras, so Waymos aren't that different from most newer vehicles on the road."", ""In cities where Waymos are available, which include San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and Phoenix, the cars are very much like human-driven taxis. They're a frequent sight as they drive around on their way to pick up passengers, or to park as they wait for their next ride request."", ""That means they're often wandering around on city streets, especially in popular and busy areas – like downtown Los Angeles. So it's quite possible the Waymos that were attacked were just going about their business and happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."", ""It's also true that Waymos are very conservative in their driving habits and won't drive threateningly if surrounded by people. So while a human driver might rev their motor or honk or drive aggressively to get out of a potentially dangerous situation, a Waymo would just calmly try to go on its way – making it an easy target."", 'Electric vehicle fires can burn hotter and more intensely than gasoline-fueled cars, if their batteries catch fire. This can happen if they are crashed or if their batteries are infiltrated with saltwater, as can happen to cars nears the coast during hurricanes and flooding events.', 'If an electric vehicle’s battery is damaged by a collision or water intrusion, a short circuit can occur, which causes the cell to discharge energy and heat up. This can lead to an event called “thermal runaway,” in which the heat propagates from one cell to the next, causing them to burn.', 'Heat generated from a fire, thermal runaway of an adjacent cell, or shorting of the battery can melt the porous membrane between the battery’s cathode and anode, causing this cell to go into thermal runaway. The heat causes the cell to vent flammable gas, which can ignite and catch fire, which can cause a chain reaction.', 'There are important distinctions between electric vehicle (EV) fires and traditional gasoline-powered vehicle fires, both in terms of combustion characteristics and potential health hazards, said Dr. Alberto Caban-Martinez, deputy director of the Sylvester Firefighter Cancer Initiative at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.', 'EV fires can release gases such as hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and metal-based particulates.', '“These emissions differ in composition from those generated by gasoline combustion, which primarily include carbon monoxide, benzene, and other hydrocarbons,” he said. ', 'The health concerns from EV fires arise for anyone nearby, particularly bystanders downwind of the smoke plume who may inhale toxic combustion byproducts, Caban-Martinez said.', 'But firefighters are at special risk due to the frequency and intensity of their exposure to EV fires.', '“Firefighters often work in close proximity to the fire, are involved in prolonged suppression and overhaul tasks, and may experience cumulative exposure over the course of their careers. Repeated exposures,  even at low doses to hazardous substances released during EV fires can increase the risk of long-term health effects, including respiratory disease and cancer,” Caban-Martinez said.', ""If an electric vehicle's battery catches fire, different firefighting techniques can be required to quench it. Firefighters are trained on these techniques and the National Fire Protection Association offers emergency response guides to most alternative fuel vehicles."", 'Today most EVs are built with what are known as ""cut loops"" or ""first responder loops"" that allow firefighters and first responders to easily cut and disconnect the high-voltage system outside of the high voltage battery, to reduce the risk of electric shock and possible fire. Note: this can only be done safely by trained professionals with the appropriate tools and gear.', 'EV fires are more difficult to put out than ones in gasoline-powered cars and require different firefighting techniques, which firefighters are trained on.', 'The biggest difference is that an EV battery fire cannot be put out with the type of firefighting foam used to smother other fires. If an EV battery is on fire, it does not require oxygen to burn because it is self-sustaining, so the foam cannot stop the fire.', 'Instead, the battery must be cooled to stop the fire and end thermal runaway. One technique is to use special ""pancake nozzles"" that can slide underneath the vehicle to spray water on the bottom of the battery box, though these require large amounts of water.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNXpTMnhqU1MxRFZGQlJiM2RGVFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdrQkFvNktMV1pNb2dJ=-w280-h168-p-df
