Like the existing ROG Ally and Ally X, the new Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share the same 7-inch 1080p screen, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and VRR support.', 'The Xbox Ally uses a previously unannounced AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip, combined with 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and 512GB of M.2 2280 SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X upgrades the chip to AMD’s Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD.', 'All of these specs make them very similar to Asus’ existing Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs at heart, but there are some much-needed changes to the software side that could make the Windows handheld experience a lot better.', '“We know that to take this handheld experience to the next level, we cannot do this alone,” says Shawn Yen, vice president of consumer at Asus, in a briefing with The Verge, admitting that some gamers have found it “frustrating and confusing” to navigate Windows with joysticks and button until now.', 'Microsoft and Asus have been collaborating closely on these two new Xbox Ally devices over the past year, and Yen says Microsoft and Asus “share a joint obsession” on these new handhelds.', 'That joint obsession includes Microsoft making good on its promise to combine “the best of Xbox and Windows together,” thanks to a new Xbox full-screen experience on Windows that’s designed specifically for handhelds. Not only can the Xbox Ally devices boot directly to this interface, but the companies claim you can easily get back to it using a new dedicated Xbox button on these handhelds, much like an Xbox console.', 'Microsoft doesn’t load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes in this full-screen Xbox experience, putting Windows firmly in the background and freeing up more memory for games. Instead, you launch straight into the Xbox PC app, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, and what Microsoft calls “other leading storefronts.”', 'This aggregated gaming library means you’ll see games from Xbox, Game Pass, and all your PC games installed from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere in a single interface, much like what the GOG launcher offers. Earlier this week, we started seeing parts of this unified library appear in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft says you’ll be able to access your full Xbox console library through Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play to an Xbox console.', 'The idea is that you should be able to seamlessly launch any game you own, whether it’s actually installed on your handheld, streaming from your Xbox Series X over home Wi-Fi, or streaming from the cloud, though we have yet to try that ourselves.', 'Microsoft has also made some additional tweaks to the Xbox PC app and Game Bar to make this all more handheld-friendly, including the ability to log in via the Windows lockscreen with your controller, no touchscreen taps required. You’ll also be able to use this handheld-friendly Game Bar interface to easily launch apps like Discord, or alt-tab between apps and games, or adjust settings without having to fiddle with the touchscreen. You can read all about all the Windows changes in my deep dive look at this new Xbox PC experience right here.', 'These two Xbox Ally devices also have Xbox-like contoured grips. It’s as if Microsoft and Asus have taken an Xbox controller and squeezed a screen between the grips, similar to what Sony did with its PlayStation Portal. The grips have been designed like this to make it easier to wrap your hands around the entire controls, so you access all the buttons and triggers.', 'The Xbox Ally X even has impulse triggers like all modern Xbox controllers, so you’ll feel things like terrain of roads during racing games or the impact of bullets in a shooter, all thanks to the haptics on the triggers. Asus is also using a USB-C 4 connector that supports Thunderbolt 4 on the more powerful Xbox Ally X, offering the possibility of connecting a powerful external GPU to it, alongside a single USB-C 3.2 port and a UHS-II microSD card reader. The Xbox Ally uses two USB-C 3.2 ports instead.', 'Microsoft and Asus aren’t providing any benchmarks or a real sense of performance for these handhelds yet, and both use chips we haven’t tested. But interestingly, they appear to be focusing on battery life this time around.', '“For this generation the most important thing to us is efficiency. Efficiency is our new superpower,” says Yen. “The games will be able to play cooler and quieter, and at the same time offer you a longer battery life for gameplay.” AMD told us in January that the Z2 Extreme would be both its most powerful and most efficient handheld chip yet, while the Z2 A is rumored to be based on the Steam Deck’s less powerful but battery-sipping Van Gogh-based chip.', 'Importantly, the Xbox Ally is using a 60Wh battery, 50 percent larger than the pack that shipped in the original ROG Ally, while the more powerful Xbox Ally X uses an 80Wh battery, tied with the Ally X and the largest you can find in a handheld today. The Windows tweaks may also improve battery, with Microsoft claiming it’s already seeing one-third of the drain when these Xbox Full Screen Experience systems are idle and asleep.', 'If you want extra performance, you’ll also be able to dock these Xbox Ally devices to Asus’ XG mobile device that offers up an RTX 5090 laptop GPU to overhaul how games play on these handheld devices.', 'These new Xbox Ally handhelds will launch during the holiday season later this year, and Microsoft and Asus are planning to share pricing and preorder information in the coming months.', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

The Steam Deck OLED 512GB costs $549 and the Nintendo Switch 2 costs $449.99.', 'As for the top-end ROG Xbox Ally X model, it might make sense for this one to be pushed more towards the $799 mark, given the previous pricing of the top-end Ally X, and other rivals such as the Zotac Zone, which also costs $799.', 'Want to know more about the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Aly specs?

It also has 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and a smaller 512GB internal SSD. Power wise, it’s similar to Valve’s Steam Deck. However, Valve’s handheld was released almost four years ago now.', 'Both Xbox Ally models come with the same 7-inch Full HD resolution IPS screen, with an 120Hz refresh rate and FreeSync Premium variable refresh rate tech. They also both support Wifi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4.', 'The port configuration between the two is slightly different as well, with the ROG Xbox Ally X model featuring a beefier USB4 Type-C port in one instance that benefits from Thunderbolt 4 support, alongside a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, a microSD reader and a headphone jack. By comparison, the ROG Xbox Ally has two of those USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports.', ""The ROG Xbox Ally X also benefits from a larger 80Wh battery (the same as the ROG Ally X) against the standard one's smaller 60Wh cell. The 80W battery should provide around 2.5 to 8 hours of playtime, depending on the game, while you’re looking at 2 to 5 hours on the ROG Xbox Ally."", ""The ROG Xbox Ally X also has Microsoft's clever impulse triggers inside for trigger-based rumble in supported titles, while both models have Hall Effect analog sticks for more precise inputs, and run Windows 11 Home with Microsoft's new handheld-first Xbox interface for easy navigation into games. The handhelds also feature Xbox controller-inspired grips for a more ergonomic experience."", ""As for the Switch 2, there are some similarities between Nintendo’s console and the ROG Xbox Ally. Both have a 1080p screen that’s 120Hz and VRR-supported, but the Switch 2's is nearly an inch larger. The Nintendo Switch 2 also has HDR support as well, while the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally do not."", 'Performance between the two handhelds is hard to judge, although the Ryzen Z2A chip inside the Xbox Ally is similar to that inside the Steam Deck and looks to be targeting 720p performance. The Nintendo Switch 2 targets 1080p and can also output at 4K when docked, which suggests it’s more powerful.

I tested Xbox’s powerful — and heavy — new handheld,https://www.polygon.com/xbox/605713/xbox-ally-x-handheld-test-review-weight-heavy,"['Asus and Xbox’s new handheld weighs 1.58 pounds, and it’s noticeable', 'BY MADDY MYERS', 'During a series of in-person Xbox demos at the 2025 Summer Game Fest, I got the chance to play Gears of War: Reloaded on the company’s upcoming handheld: the ROG Xbox Ally X. The 7-inch screen looks gorgeous, and the game’s remaster is a stunner no matter what size screen it’s on (I also played it on some much bigger TV screens). But the most noticeable thing about the ROG Xbox Ally X was, unfortunately, how tired my forearms were after just 20 minutes of playing the Gears of War remaster.', 'Designing a handheld console is a tightrope walk. If I’m playing at home, I want a device that’s powerful enough to compete with my TV or gaming PC. If I’m lounging on the couch playing your Switch 2 or Steam Deck, there needs to be a reason why I’m not reaching over for the remote and just playing a game on the TV instead. For me, a handheld console also needs to be light enough that it feels truly portable — something you can throw into a purse or backpack and bring with you to a place where it won’t be competing directly with your TV or PC. So it needs to split the difference between being powerful enough to run contemporary AAA games and have them look great in comparison to your TV, and yet not so powerful that it weighs down your travel bag.', 'Most important of all, no matter where I’m playing it, a handheld needs to be comfortable to hold for hours at a time. The original Nintendo Switch was no trouble whatsoever; it would be ages before you even notice its minuscule weight (although you sure might notice how few contemporary AAA games it can run). On a Steam Deck, I might feel that weight much sooner, the impressive processing power aside. And if it’s the ROG Xbox Ally X — well, I haven’t played it for long enough to know for certain, but I have held it and played a game on it for about 20 minutes, and it was already an issue even in that short time.', 'The Xbox Ally comes in two versions, just like the Xbox Series X and S consoles: There’s a little one and a big one. As a proud owner of the Xbox Series S (which I lovingly refer to as “the baby Xbox”), I’ll probably be fine with the smaller Xbox Ally. But the main reason I’m saying that is actually the weight. Let’s get into the numbers, shall we?', 'Looking up all of these numbers after the Xbox event was a comfort to me, because it made me feel like I wasn’t imagining that the ROG Xbox Ally X was the heaviest one I’d ever held. It will be the heaviest handheld on the market, once it reaches all of us this holiday season. (I did talk to an Asus representative at the Xbox event and told him my concerns about its weight, but I fully recognize it’s probably too late for them to change it. Let it be known that I tried, though.)', 'What’s interesting about this is that it might not actually bother that many other people who aren’t me. This is a pretty subjective problem, and I would say it’s somewhat gendered as well. There were lots of other reporters at this event with me, the majority of them men. I overheard many of them praising the way the Xbox handheld felt in their hands — “just like an Xbox controller.” I can’t disagree there; it’s the right shape and absolutely does feel comfortable in terms of size and layout. But I wonder: Did any of those guys notice the weight? Or is that just a problem for somebody of my stature?', 'The thing is, people of my stature do actually also play video games. And I play a heck of a lot of them in handheld format; I’d say about 50% of the time I’m on a big screen, the other 50% in handheld. I’m still in LA at Summer Game Fest right now, but the first thing I’m going to do when I get home tomorrow night is open my Switch 2 box and play Mario Kart World — probably in handheld mode. And even though the Switch 2 is heavier than its predecessor, I bet I’m going to feel pretty relieved by how light it feels compared to the Xbox handheld I tried out yesterday.', 'All that said, there’s a lot about the Xbox Ally that’s very impressive. Unlike the Steam Deck, it uses Windows, and the Linux users reading this aren’t going to want to hear what I’m about to say, but that’s going to be a preferable operating system for most people because it’s so much more familiar.', 'Over the years, I have managed to get quite a few games running on my Steam Deck that were not necessarily intended to run natively on that device, but it’s taken some serious fiddling. By contrast, the Xbox Ally has Steam and Battle.net icons that you can just click on, as well as Discord integration. I can already tell it’s going to be extremely simple to play tons of different games on there, without nearly as much fiddling as it took for me to get my Blizzard games working properly on my Steam Deck.', 'The Xbox handheld is clearly designed with power in mind. It’s heavy because it has a lot under the hood that helps games look great and run smoothly. That’s certainly going to help it compete with the Steam Deck as well, especially as that handheld is increasingly showing its age. Put all of that together and it could make for an impressive holiday launch, even in the same year as the Switch 2.', 'But every time I think about this device entering my home, I think about how my arms start to hurt when I’ve been playing the Steam Deck for too many hours in a row. I think about how I sometimes have to rest my arms on a pillow and even then, it’s not quite the right angle, and it’s kind of annoying. It’s not something that most buyers are even going to be aware of until they have the device in their hands, but if they’re anything like me in terms of size and arm strength, it’s going to be the very first thing they notice as soon as they take it out of the box. Microsoft can only hope that doesn’t result in them putting that device right back into that box and slapping a return label on it.', '', '© 2025 VALNET INC.', '', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHhNRTFtVTJWUFpVNHlRV1E1VFJEZ0FSalFBaWdLTWdrVkFKU3JLV2dlSUFN=-w280-h168-p-df

Visually they aren't the most impressive, but the trade off might be worth it when you actually get them in your hand."", '', ""For those who were hoping the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X would play Xbox games, I'm sorry to report that this is a tried-and-true Windows PC in essence, meaning that you cannot bring (most) of your Xbox library to the device."", ""Only games that fall under Xbox Play Anywhere will work as a single-purchase entity across Xbox One, Series X|S, and the Xbox Ally, much like the ASUS ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. Xbox Cloud Gaming will also extend some of the Xbox-only games you could potentially play on this device, but you'll be limited to whatever is in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate there for the most part."", 'Since it\'s a ""Windows PC"" in gaming handheld form, you will also be able to natively run other gaming stores like Steam, Battle.net, GOG, and launchers like the Riot Client and HoYoverse launcher. Microsoft is working towards bringing more Xbox games to Windows via a big push for Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming, but it remains to be seen just how many of the thousands of Xbox platform-bound games it can technologically or even legally bring across.', ""Since I've seen this question a lot on socials, yes. As mentioned, you can install anything you want on this thing, it's just a Windows 11 gaming PC in essence."", 'This is an ""Xbox"" handheld in name only, essentially. Otherwise, you can think of it like a regular Windows 11 gaming laptop squashed into a Nintendo Switch-like chassis.', 'You will be able to open the Windows 11 desktop, download mods, install launchers like HoYoverse, Riot Client, or Battle.net. You will be able to use Microsoft Office, watch Netflix, and do pretty much anything your laptop can do. It might even be more powerful than your laptop. You could probably edit videos in Adobe Premier on the Xbox Ally X. Maybe even the regular Xbox Ally.', 'The limitations of the ""Xbox"" brand are more to the detriment of Xbox gamers, really. Xbox console games you own will not run on this thing, unless they have Xbox Play Anywhere support. The majority of modern Xbox games, at least in the last 5 years or so, all support Xbox Play Anywhere. Very few games are retro-actively upgraded to Xbox Play Anywhere though, sadly.', '', 'The Xbox Ally range will come in two flavors, white and black, cheaper and more expensive. But, both will work on a suped-up version of Windows 11, complete with a new full screen Xbox app experience that Microsoft is still working hard to deliver.', ""As detailed during the Xbox Showcase in June 2025, Microsoft revealed that the Xbox Ally range will have exclusive access to a version of Windows 11 that uses 66% less battery life while idle, and can also multi-task using the controllers. Microsoft is working hard to make sure that on devices like the Xbox Ally, you won't need to use a mouse and keyboard, or the touch screen even, to do basic Windows things."", ""For example, you will be able to sign in to the Xbox Ally using the controller for the first time, navigating the keypad using regular inputs. Additionally, when the new Xbox PC app is running in full screen mode, it will reduce RAM and power consumption by a third, by eliminating unnecessary processes in Windows 11. You will also be able to launch apps and multi-task with the controller, without having to open up the Desktop or Explorer environments. This new multi-tasking feature could have huge implications for Windows in general, particularly on devices and user scenarios where having a mouse and keyboard isn't viable."", ""Both devices will have Wi-Fi 6E, ideal for cloud gaming and remote streaming. They will also have Bluetooth for every day Windows accessories, and a variety of buttons, inputs, back buttons, and more. The ASUS command center for controlling power profiles and the like will be baked into the Xbox Game Bar this time around, eliminating the need to open into ASUS' software to change up the TDP power settings and such."", '', ""I've argued in the past that Xbox has no choice but to make its own gaming handheld, and I believe that to still be the case, despite the reveal of the Xbox Ally."", 'Microsoft is working on bringing more of Xbox to Windows, but it remains true that tens of millions of players own digital Xbox games that can only work on an ""Xbox"" device, per licensing agreement terms with publishers and developers. Every game Microsoft revealed at this year\'s Xbox Showcase came with Xbox Play Anywhere, but that does nothing retroactively for the hundreds of games I already own, locked to Xbox consoles.', 'As such, in order to run games designed for the Xbox One / Series X|S ""ERA"" development environment, Microsoft would need to either build a device that is natively ""ERA,"" or features some kind of emulation. It\'s unclear if Microsoft has the licenses to actually simply emulate ""ERA"" games on Windows-based devices, which is almost certainly what the next-gen Xbox consoles are going to be. It\'s unclear if it\'s even technologically possible in a device as small as a handheld with modern chips.', 'Indeed, Xbox lead Phil Spencer has been hinting for a long time that the next Xbox console will be more Windows-like than ever before, potentially with the ability to run third-party stores like Steam and GOG. If Microsoft can execute on that vision, building a console that is essentially a TV-friendly PC with the openness and compatibility of Windows, it could be a game changer. What is less clear is what would happen to current Xbox players, who have invested billions of dollars into content that is locked to the Xbox ""ERA"" development environment.', ""These are by no means insurmountable hurdles hopefully, particularly so for a company like Microsoft. Whether it's emulation, updated licensing agreements, or native Xbox Play Anywhere ports, I'm told Microsoft was working on its very own Xbox handheld for native gaming, slated for a 2027 launch window. It has since been side-lined, in favor of doubling down on the Xbox Ally with ASUS."", ""As the battle for consumers' free time rages, Microsoft and other game publishers more than ever need to meet players where they are. The ability to take my Xbox experience with me, without needing to rely on an internet connection, would dramatically increase my playtime hours, and most likely many others as well. Xbox's PC handhelds will improve Microsoft's footprint in the space, but they will struggle to compete with Steam, which has far more games to buy, and a mature app platform that comes equipped with a tablet-friendly Big Picture mode already."", ""Either way, it's increasingly intriguing where all these handheld shenanigans are going. Definitely watch this space, and drop more questions below, and I'll try to get them answered."", 'Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

"I'm not saying I regret buying a Nintendo Switch 2, but the ROG Xbox Ally X is almost everything I want from an Xbox handheld",https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-handheld-rog-xbox-ally-x-hands-on-preview-first-impressions/,"[""With its first handheld, Xbox's 'Play Anywhere' strategy is coming into sharper focus"", '', ""After years of rumor and speculation, finally getting my hands on an actual Xbox handheld is a pretty surreal experience. The ROG Xbox Ally X is an exceptionally impressive piece of technology, and a bold new way to interact with the Xbox ecosystem. It's also the result of a somewhat shocking collaboration between a platform holder looking to get serious about a burgeoning 'Play Anywhere' strategy and a manufacturer looking to widen its mass market appeal – ASUS having become best known for creating powerful, if somewhat unapproachable, handheld gaming PCs."", ""It's exceptionally rare for platform-holders to collaborate with external partners like this. Hardware is treated as serious business. When you're asking players to make a large financial investment, you better get it right the first time; one wrong move in the console market and it's near impossible to recover."", 'The Dreamcast decimated SEGA. An ill-defined vision crippled the Wii U. It took Sony seven years to regain ground after the PS3 launch debacle. The Xbox One was so poorly received that it inflicted psychic damage on an entire generation of players. Even Valve got a rare reality check with its Steam Machines, forcing the company to eventually refocus its hardware ambitions towards the Steam Deck.', 'So, why risk taking a new hardware initiative out of house? Collaboration is, after all, code for relinquishing some amount of control – be it over form-factor, internal components, or user experience. All of this preamble is vital context to say that I think Xbox may have made the right move here. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X – the two systems headlining this new initiative, set for release in 2025 – appear to take the best of what Asus already has on the market, matching it with some really interesting refinements and optimizations, to make the system more palatable for a wider mass market.', '', ""Let's start with how the ROG Xbox Ally X felt in my hands. At 715 grams, it's technically heavier than the Steam Deck (669 grams) and its OLED variant (640 grams), but you wouldn't know it from the way weight has been distributed across the console. I can't say how well the ROG Xbox Ally X will hold up during longer play-sessions, but the hour I spent with the machine didn't raise any immediate red flags."", ""I'm also a big fan of the ROG Xbox Ally X form-factor, with Xbox having worked closely with Asus on a redesign of the existing ROG Ally X. The console features new contoured handgrips, built to the same design principles that inspired the Xbox Wireless Controller. It's largely comfortable, the ABXY button and asymmetrical thumbstick placement make immediate sense to a brain wired to Xbox's controller rhythms."", ""Xbox's CVP of gaming devices and ecosystem, Roanne Sones, says this has been done to make the console more accommodating to a wider range of handsizes, although I must admit I did still struggle to comfortably stretch my index fingers across the left and right bumpers. The inclusion of Impulse Triggers into the ROG Xbox Ally X design (these aren't included in the cheaper ROG Xbox Ally) felt fantastic as I was chewing through Locust in the opening stages of Gears of War: Reloaded."", ""Speaking of the play experience, it felt exceptionally smooth. The ROG Xbox Ally X is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, packs 24GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. I've always been more a console player then a PC gamer, so I'll admit that the significance of the silicon and components inside of the system is a little lost on me. But I know a good feeling and looking video game when I play one."", '', ""So while I can't speak to how more demanding titles will ultimately handle on the system – nor to the experience of Xbox Cloud Gaming or Xbox Remote Play – there was little obvious daylight between playing a first-party Xbox game natively on ROG Xbox Ally X versus playing it on Xbox Series X. The framerate of Gears Reloaded was rocksolid 60fps, with the system supporting 120Hz refresh rate and FreeSync Premium, and the remastered visuals popped on the 7-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) screen. I'm genuinely impressed, and can easily see the ROG Xbox Ally X becoming a vital part of my commute."", ""What's really sold me on the concept of the ROG Xbox Ally systems is the work Microsoft has done to optimize the core user-experience. This isn't merely a standard ROG Ally with an Xbox button punched in above the left thumbstick, the Xbox and Windows divisions have collaborated to create a more refined mobile ecosystem. One of the reasons I've always been a little scared off by PC gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally are that they are exactly that – the standard PC experience scaled down to handheld size. I've always gravitated towards console gaming because I want as few barriers to getting into the games I want to play as possible, optimized for the best possible experience out of the box."", '', ""Booting up the ROG Xbox Ally X, rather than hit standard Windows 11 OS screens I'm pushed directly into the Xbox full screen experience. An aggregated gaming library is right there waiting, designed to reflect the look and style of the traditional Xbox ecosystem as it exists across console, mobile, and cloud devices. I say aggregated gaming library because as well as supporting native, cloud, and remote play experiences, the ROG Xbox Ally systems will also give quick access to all of your video games across Xbox, Game Pass, Battle Net, and any other Windows PC-based storefront. It's really clean, it's fast, and features none of the nonsense that I sometimes (fairly or not) associate with playing on PC."", ""This Xbox full screen experience has been fully optimized for handheld too. Background activity and non-essential tasks in the Windows 11 OS are minimized, routing system resources like the 24GB of memory towards higher framerates and consistent performance. The Xbox button brings up a Game Bar overlay allowing for easy access to apps, chat, and settings, and lets me quickly shift between recently played games. It didn't feel like I was interacting with an existing handheld PC that had been retrofitted to allow for integrated Xbox functionality, but rather a device that was built to deliver it."", '', ""I've been wanting an Xbox handheld for years now. In a world where I can access the best Xbox games through everything from the Series X to web browsers, or punch into Game Pass from Smart TVs and Fire Sticks, it didn't make much sense to me that Microsoft didn't have a comprehensive solution for gaming on the go. The inelegant solution up until now had always been to strap my smartphone into something like the Razer Kishi V2 and pray that the battery life or Wi-Fi connection held. That is about to change."", ""I always said I'd purchase a Steam Deck once (and only once) an optimized Game Pass experience was available. I was starting to crack on that purchasing decision, the console becoming more attractive the more I've been exposed to them in the world. But the ROG Xbox Ally X has come around just in time. While I'm certainly curious to know what a first-party developed Xbox handheld would look like – to be clear, Xbox staff I've spoken to have made no commitment to such a device in the future – the ROG Xbox Ally X is shaping up to be an exceptionally solid solution. A way to natively pick up my progress of whatever Xbox game I'm playing in any given week, and take it out into the world without having to worry that the experience will be hindered by some invisible force."", 'The question that will ultimately determine whether the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are a success, however, is the cost of the thing. Xbox and Asus will not speak to pricing just yet, and I am worried that the two systems are going to be prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of players. The existing ROG Ally and ROG Ally X consoles retail at $649.99 and $799.99, respectively. If this pricing structure holds for the ROG Xbox Ally consoles, that would put the two incoming devices as the most expensive pillars of the Xbox hardware family. The Xbox Series X recently increased in price from $499 to $599.', 'The question then, perhaps, Microsoft will be asking players around Holiday 2025 is just how much they value the idea of having a full Xbox experience with them everywhere they go. With a 512GB Steam Deck OLED priced competitively at $549, and the Nintendo Switch 2 at $449.99, it might be an uncomfortable conversation.', ""Here's all of the key upcoming Xbox games that you'll be able to play on the ROG Xbox Ally X."", '', ""Josh West is the Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar+.

They will launch in the holiday period of 2025, with pricing information not yet revealed.', 'The Xbox Ally is being pitched as a ""great value"" generalist device, while the Xbox Ally X is described as an ""ultimate high-performance"" handheld for more demanding players, not dissimilar to how Asus\' existing ROG Ally and Ally X handhelds are pitched. Both use AMD processors.', ""These Windows 11-enabled handhelds include Xbox-branded buttons, a gaming-focused interface, and an aggregated library feature that brings players' software together from across different PC storefronts, as well as the subscription library of Xbox Game Pass."", ""On top of playing PC games natively, the two handhelds can stream players' console libraries using Xbox Cloud Gaming and Remote Play."", ""The interface will be familiar to anyone who's owned an Xbox console in the past decade or so. The 'Xbox full screen experience' apparently optimises the Ally and Ally X specifically for gameplay functionality. Non-essential tasks are deferred by the device, dedicating more resources to playing games, according to Microsoft."", ""The contoured grips of the console were apparently designed with the principles behind Xbox's wireless controllers in mind. Accessibility features from Xbox and Windows will be carried over to the handhelds. Xbox Play Anywhere – where a single game purchase functions across PC, console, and cloud gaming – extends to these devices too."", 'Each handheld has a dedicated Xbox button to bring up the Game Bar and switch instantly between apps and games, too.', 'Launch territories for the Xbox Ally and Ally X are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.', 'Xbox says other territories where ROG Ally products are currently available will follow.', ""So: what does Microsoft's messaging tell us about who it's targeting with the two handhelds?"", 'The Windows factor', ""The ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X further Microsoft's objective for players' game libraries to come with them no matter which device they're using. For players with both a PC and Xbox console, plus a Game Pass subscription, the way save data is synced seamlessly between the two is something to behold. A handheld device enables Xbox to extend that ecosystem one step further, which will be welcome to diehard users."", 'But the goal here goes much further than that, and this is where the Windows 11 element of the new handhelds is crucial.', 'Windows is talked up by Microsoft as a major plus in the announcement, with careful wording – ""because these handhelds run Windows, you have access to games you can\'t get elsewhere, so you can enjoy the full freedom and versatility of PC gaming all straight from the Xbox experience"" – feeling like it has Valve firmly in its sights.', ""The Steam Deck, which kicked off the current wave of PC handhelds, plays games via the Linux-based SteamOS. While it's excellent at running games directly from the Steam library, it's not particularly flexible when it comes to installing and running games from other storefronts (unless you're prepared to tinker with the device). It's also only available to buy from Steam itself."", 'Microsoft clearly identifies an opportunity to offer a more wide-ranging device to PC players out of the box, while courting its existing console audience with the Xbox branding.', ""Superficially, Microsoft and Asus have just made two new versions of the ROG Ally that happen to have an Xbox button on them. But the opportunity here for Xbox is in positioning: the gulf between more specialist PC handhelds (the Steam Deck has sold around 4 million units, according to analysts) and Nintendo's mass market Switch (150 million sold) is enormous. Could Microsoft bridge the gap between those audiences?"", ""The PC gaming handheld space is still relatively new, after all. Having two devices with different specs, too, nicely mirrors Microsoft's own strategy with the Xbox Series S and X, and isn't something Nintendo or Sony have tried before with their handheld launches."", 'Ampere Analysis\' Piers Harding-Rolls shared his thoughts on Microsoft\'s approach on LinkedIn. ""This partnership shows Microsoft’s increasing commitment to the PC gaming market, and its intent to protect and expand the role of Windows as the dominant gaming platform,"" he said.', '""A lot of Microsoft’s recent work in Game Pass has been more directly focused on the PC gaming space, as it believes this is where there is a substantial opportunity to grow its audience reach compared to console.""', ""Harding-Rolls believes that teaming up with Asus has allowed Xbox to leverage the company's trust with PC gamers, accelerate its entry into the market, deepen the integration with Windows and Xbox services, and counter the growing influence of Valve's handhelds."", 'According to Harding-Rolls, Windows PC handhelds sold 1.2 million units by the end of 2024.', 'The key unknown, of course, is price. The cheapest model of Steam Deck retails for $399. Asus has not made a handheld that cheap, with the original ROG Ally launching at $600 before dropping in price.', ""Priced reasonably, Xbox could court both its existing console players and PC users enticed by a Windows handheld tailored for games.

"I Played With the ROG Xbox Ally, the Upcoming Xbox Handheld",https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/i-played-with-the-xbox-rog-ally-the-upcoming-xbox-handheld/,"['The new handheld console was revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase, and I got to spend some time with my hands on it.', 'Microsoft revealed its long-rumored Xbox handheld console running Windows 11 during the Xbox Games Showcase -- two models called the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X -- and I spent a short time playing around with one soon after. ', ""I wasn't allowed to take any pictures or videos of the demo, since the hardware I got to test wasn't final. That became evident when our designated guide had HDMI connection issues with the unit. I was able to play around with the Xbox full-screen experience and the various settings menus and play the beginning minutes of Gears of War Reloaded, which comes out this summer.  "", ""Built by Asus, the device is quite comfortable to hold, with slightly textured grips. The face buttons, triggers and analog sticks all felt familiar, very similar to what I'm used to on an Xbox controller. "", ""What's really exciting is that you can download your games, remote play from your Xbox or stream from the cloud, making this more useful than PlayStation's Portal, which can only stream and play remotely. That's one of the major benefits of being inside the Xbox ecosystem: You can play a game on any of its devices, regardless of where you bought it, whether that be Xbox consoles, PC, cloud or this new handheld. This more open-platform approach makes the Xbox Ally closer in spirit to a Steam Deck compared with a Nintendo Switch, which can only run Nintendo games. "", 'When it ships -- expected in time for the winter holidays -- you\'ll be able to navigate via a full-screen Xbox app, which combines your Xbox game library with installed games from several other marketplaces into a single Xbox experience. The company specifically mentioned Xbox, Game Pass, Blizzard\'s Battle.net (owned by Microsoft) and ""other leading PC storefronts,"" which I\'m hoping includes Steam. Much like on an Xbox, each game has icons depicting which platform they\'re from. In my demo, the only example of a different storefront was Hearthstone, which had a Battle.net icon. ', ""The Xbox Ally consoles use the Game Bar, and if you've used the Xbox app on PC, you'll find it familiar. In fact, pressing the new Xbox button opens an almost identical version of the guide when playing Xbox games on PC. However, there's also a new Command Center tab on the far left to adjust settings for power consumption and performance, similar to what we've seen on Steam Deck."", ""In Game Bar, you can quickly jump to the home screen, your library, launch games, open apps, chat with friends, adjust settings and more. And this Game Bar works alongside Asus's Armoury Crate overlay. This is a little worrisome, as Armoury Crate has usually felt more like unnecessary bloatware, but when we get to test the device later this year we'll see if Asus has stripped it down to the relevant functions rather than just added more on top."", 'Since it\'s a Windows 11 device, you\'ll also be able to launch and use apps like Discord and Twitch and access game mods. The Xbox Ally boots directly into the ""Xbox full screen experience"" similar to how a Steam Deck launches into Big Picture mode. The full-screen experience is optimized specifically for handheld gaming, and Xbox told me the device minimizes background activity and allocates more system resources to gameplay like Game Mode does on Windows. This means more memory and potentially higher framerates for your games.', 'The ROG Ally and Ally X have been out for a bit now, but the Xbox models have some unique features. In addition to the Xbox button, the ROG Xbox Ally also has larger, contoured grips. The previous ROG Ally is more rectangular; the Xbox Ally is closer to the design of the PlayStation Portal, with dedicated, slightly separated hand grips that mimic the look and feel of a standard game controller. They also have upgraded components over the Asus versions.', 'The handheld comes in two options, a white Xbox Ally and the more powerful Xbox Ally X that comes in black. The lower-end Ally is powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor, comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of solid-state storage, weighs 23.6 ounces (670 grams) and has a 60Wh battery. The Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, weighs a bit more at 25.2 ounces (715 grams) and has an 80Wh battery. ', ""Both models are equipped with a 7-inch, 120Hz, 1080p screen, the same as on the original Asus versions of the devices. They also have RGB lights surrounding the analog sticks, something I hope I'll be able to turn off when I spend some real time playing on the device. The Ally X did feel on the heavier side, but then again, the recently released Switch 2 and my Steam Deck OLED are also pretty hefty, so I think that's just what handhelds weigh these days."", 'Microsoft hasn\'t yet revealed pricing or a release date, aside from ""this holiday.""']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHhNRTFtVTJWUFpVNHlRV1E1VFJEZ0FSalFBaWdLTWdrVkFKU3JLV2dlSUFN=-w280-h168-p-df

And we weren't sold on the Windows version, in part, because of its price to performance ratio."", ""Valve's big play with the Steam Deck is the Steam store, just as Microsoft's is its own store, and more so, Xbox Game Pass. There are benefits to both ecosystems, but if the Xbox Ally is any more than $449 for comparable performance, I think it'll be a hard sell."", ""I am hopeful, though. The 512GB/16GB configuration of the Legion Go S is $599 with SteamOS. There's plenty of room for Microsoft to maneuver between that and the Steam Deck."", ""But it'll be easier to recommend, and hopefully more successful, if it's priced closer to Valve's handheld than Lenovo's. That I'm absolutely positive of."", '', 'A 512GB ROG Ally is currently $650. The Z1 Extreme will be a better performer than the Z2 A, we already know that.

What If the Next Xbox Console Was a NUC? (Premium),https://www.thurrott.com/games/xbox/321935/what-if-the-next-xbox-console-was-a-nuc,"['', ""As an Xbox fan, I'm still trying to digest Microsoft's push into handheld gaming PCs and what that means to the platform. But a thought occurred to me this morning as I was hashing out the ramifications of the news with Laurent. What if this new generation of third-party gaming handhelds points the way to the future of Xbox consoles? That is, what if the next Xbox consoles were simply PCs? And not just PCs, but appliance-like PCs?"", 'What if the next Xbox console was a NUC?', 'This idea--which, to be clear, sprung unbidden into my mind and is based on nothing more than me processing what just happened--makes more sense the more I think about it. It solves the problems with consoles in general. It solves the problems with Xbox consoles specifically because it means that more experienced third party hardware makers can sell them, and because it lets Xbox instantly leapfrog the console competition.', 'Last summer, I wrote about how recent advances in PC hardware and Windows 11 have transformed mainstream laptops into viable portable gaming rigs. In some ways, I was lucky to be so tuned in on this shift, as I had walked away from consoles after almost 20 years and had started gaming exclusively on the PC again. Long story short, PCs based on the latest Intel (""Lunar Lake"" or newer) or AMD (Zen 5) microprocessors have powerful enough graphics to run the most demanding modern videogames with stunning quality at 1080p/60 FPS. And the AMD chips are even better, in that they can do so at higher resolutions (2.8K and up) and with even better quality and frame rates.', ""Given this, I was not surprised to see that the ASUS-branded Xbox handhelds that Microsoft just introduced come with AMD processors, though they are of the lower-end Z2 variety aimed at that portable gaming space. That's fine, as those devices also ship with very small 7-inch/1080p/120 Hz displays, 16 or 24 GB of RAM, and 512 GB or 1 TB of M.2-based SSD storage. Their specifications map nicely to the form factor."", 'The laptops utilizing the latest Intel and AMD processors are Copilot+ PCs, so they offer even more powerful internals and bigger, higher resolution displays that likewise map nicely to those form factors. The two I use the most often as I write this both offer 2.8K (2880 × 1800) display panels with 120 Hz refresh rates, for example. And games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 run spectacularly on these laptops. Again, better on AMD.', ""Given this, it's not difficult to imagine the same hardware paired used in a NUC form factor PC. But you don't have to imagine it. They're common. And they're reasonably inexpensive, especially in an era when the highest-end PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles cost $600 or more.

Plus, the account even suggested this experience could be coming to PC gaming handhelds as a category throughout 2026.', ""Keep in mind that this is from a fan account, so you should take it with a grain of salt. But still, if Microsoft did allow PC handheld manufacturers to implement this new version of the Xbox app, it would go a long way toward fixing the big bugbear most people have with Windows handhelds: the user experience. If the new Xbox App is good, and comes to all PC gaming handhelds, it could go a long way in challenging the Steam Deck's dominance."", ""I've reached out to Asus for comment, and I'll update this story if and when the company gets back to me. Either way, the Xbox Ally X will likely be launching sometime during the holiday season, so we have a long way to go before any new Xbox app can make its way into something like the Lenovo Legion Go."", ""The Asus ROG Ally X that came out last year was easily the best handheld gaming PC I've seen yet, but it would have been even better if Windows on a touch screen wasn't so bad. Even though Armoury Crate, Asus' software that's also coming to the Xbox Ally X, does make the process easier, it's still a pain to set the system up initially."", ""The ROG Xbox Ally X being essentially a sequel to last year's device is exciting, because it looks to be taking an excellent handheld and using it to make handheld PC gaming better as a whole. I don't know whether or not this rumor is true, but if it is, PC gaming is going to have its best year in a long time."", ""To this day, I still recommend the Steam Deck to a lot of people who aren't super comfortable fiddling around with Windows. It is just so easy to turn the thing on, connect your Steam account, and start downloading and playing games. The only thing that really holds it back is that other PC game launchers aren't natively supported, at least not without installing Windows."", ""We're still a ways out from the Xbox Ally X actually hitting the market, and it's entirely possible that Microsoft is talking a bigger game than it can actually deliver. It wouldn't be the first time the company has fumbled a new Windows feature, after all. But if this full-screen Xbox experience is good, it should be made available to all PC gamers."", 'If there\'s one thing Microsoft has made clear over the last few years its that it looks at pretty much any device that can play Xbox games and says ""this is an Xbox.""

This is how Microsoft is combining Windows and Xbox for handheld PCs,https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices,"['Two new Xbox Ally devices introduce Microsoft’s much-needed improvements to handheld gaming PCs.', '', 'Microsoft and Asus have just announced two ROG Xbox Ally devices that include a new full-screen Xbox experience for handhelds. After promising to combine “the best of Xbox and Windows together” for handhelds earlier this year, Microsoft is now revealing exactly how it is overhauling the Xbox app, Game Bar, and Windows itself to better compete with SteamOS.', 'Microsoft has needed to respond to SteamOS ever since the Steam Deck launched three years ago, and it has steadily been tweaking its Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar on Windows to make both more handheld-friendly. But there was always a bigger overhaul of Windows required, and we’re starting to see parts of that today.', '“The reality is that we’ve made tremendous progress on this over the last couple of years, and this is really the device that galvanized those teams and got everybody marching and working towards a moment that we’re just really excited to put into the hands of players,” says Roanne Sones, corporate vice president of gaming Devices and ecosystem at Xbox, in a briefing with The Verge.', 'Microsoft demonstrated this handheld-friendly combination of Windows and Xbox to The Verge in a briefing earlier this week, but it was a virtual demo so we haven’t been able to try it fully yet. It all starts by booting directly into a new Xbox full-screen experience on these ROG Xbox Ally devices that focuses on the Xbox app and Game Bar, alongside being a launcher for all your PC games — yes even Steam ones.', '“We were able to take people who have been working on the Xbox OS for 20 years or more and have them work directly on the Windows codebase and start reimagining what that operating system looks like for this form factor,” explains Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox. “These two things combined led us to build a bunch of features.”', 'The Xbox full-screen experience is very much the compact mode of the Xbox app taking full control of the ROG Xbox Ally devices, instead of the familiar Windows desktop and taskbar. “When the player boots into the full-screen experience there is a whole bunch of Windows stuff that doesn’t get loaded,” says Beaumont. “We’re not loading the desktop wallpaper, the taskbar, or a bunch of processes that are really designed around productivity scenarios for Windows.”', 'You can still exit this full-screen mode and launch the full version of the Windows desktop, but by default it will by hidden away. “We’ve reduced many notifications and pop-ups, and we will continue to listen to feedback from players to make continued improvements,” says Sones.', 'The Xbox app itself in full-screen mode looks very similar to what exists on Windows right now, except the library is now full of all of your PC games from Steam and other stores, alongside ones from Xbox Play Anywhere and Game Pass. Where it really gets interesting is the Game Bar.', '“We’ve made a lot of improvements to Game Bar over the last year, and really it was driving towards this device,” says Brianna Potvin, principal software engineering lead at Xbox. A short press on the Xbox button on the Xbox Ally devices brings up the Game Bar interface, and you can use this to access device settings like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, Asus’ Command Center interface, and even Microsoft’s new Gaming Copilot. If you long press on the Xbox button then you’ll even get a more handheld-friendly task switcher, which lets you alt+tab between apps and games using the controller.', 'I’ll need to try this new interface fully to really get a feel for the Windows changes here, but Microsoft is promising that this isn’t just lipstick on top of Windows. “This isn’t surface-level changes, we’ve made significant improvements,” says Potvin. “Some of our early testing with the components we’ve turned off in Windows, we get about 2GB of memory going back to the games while running in the full-screen experience.”', 'That’s a good step to improve the performance of Windows on handhelds, but one of the big pieces of feedback around the handheld experience is the sleep situation where Windows-powered devices often draw far too much battery life when they’re idle.', '“If you’re booting your device into the full-screen experience and you’re putting it down and it’s going to sleep, it draws one third of the idle power draw than if it was booting the same device into the [Windows] desktop experience,” claims Potvin. Microsoft is still focused on battery life and power efficiency for this full-screen mode, so we might even see further improvements before devices ship later this year. Microsoft has also made improvements to the Windows lockscreen, so you can now use a controller to log in using a PIN code, or navigate around in this part of Windows.', 'This updated Xbox app will now work as a launcher for all your PC games, but you’ll still be able to interact with Windows apps and those other launchers freely in this full-screen handheld experience. Sones says Microsoft is “working closely with leading storefronts to have them optimize their full screen experience,” to make it easy for everyone to play a full library of PC games from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere.', '“The aggregated gaming library within Xbox on PC will be available for all Windows 11 devices,” says Sones, so you’ll soon be able to see all of your Steam games within the Xbox app on any PC.', 'Microsoft is also creating its own version of Valve’s Steam Deck verified program, allowing you to see what games are optimized for handhelds like the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. You’ll also be able to access your full Xbox console library on handhelds thanks to either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play from an Xbox console, but most console games won’t play natively unless there’s a PC version or they’re part of Xbox Play Anywhere.', 'The best part of all these Windows changes is that you won’t necessarily need a new device to benefit from them. “The Xbox full-screen experience will first come to the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X, and our next focus will be updating the in-market ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X,” says Sones. “Similar full-screen Xbox experiences will be rolling out to other Windows handhelds, starting next year.”', 'Valve is also supporting SteamOS on the ROG Ally, so we should be able to compare Valve and Microsoft’s handheld operating systems on the same hardware soon. We don’t yet know if Microsoft has done enough to stop other PC makers from being tempted over to SteamOS like Lenovo has, but Microsoft’s efforts are really setting up a battle between Windows and Linux for the future of handheld gaming PCs.', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

Xbox Ally X vs. Steam Deck,https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-ally-x-vs-steam-deck,"['Microsoft has finally announced the Xbox Ally X, after months of speculation that it was working on some kind of handheld gaming PC. What makes this handheld especially interesting is that Microsoft is tuning up its software to make Windows more usable with a controller, even having the OS launch straight into a refined Xbox App.', '', ""If that sounds familiar, it's because the Steam Deck works in a very similar way. Valve tuned its handheld to run on a specialized version of Linux, and the device boots straight into what's essentially a handheld version of Steam Big Picture mode. If Microsoft is able to pull it off, this could be the moment Windows handhelds have been waiting for."", ""We'll have to wait a bit longer to see just how well the Xbox Ally X holds its own against the Steam Deck, but we already know a bunch about the new handheld. So how do the two compare so far?"", 'Both the Xbox Ally X and the Steam Deck are built on AMD APUs that were specifically made for handheld gaming PCs. However, with three years seperating the devices, a lot has changed.', ""The Steam Deck came out before the Z1 Extreme that powered the first wave of mainstream Windows handhelds like the ROG Ally. But the chip is similar in a lot of ways. It's an APU with a 4-core, 8-thread Zen 2 CPU, which is paired with an 8-core RDNA 2 GPU. While this chipset can do a lot, especially in the lower-specced indie games that thrive on the handheld, it is getting up there in age. After all, Zen 2 launched in 2019 with the Ryzen 9 3900X, and RDNA 2 in 2020 with the Radeon RX 6800 XT."", ""The Steam Deck processor actually looks a lot like the non-X Xbox Ally, which has AMD's new 'Z2 A' APU. Despite that new name, however, it very closely matches the Steam Deck's specs."", ""The other Microsoft handheld takes things to another level though. The Xbox Ally X is powered by the AMD AI Z2 Extreme. This APU is nearly identical to the Z2 Extreme that AMD announced at CES 2025, just with an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) stapled onto it. Beyond the AI capabilities though, it's still an 8-core, 16-thread Zen 5 CPU, paired with an RDNA 3.5 GPU with 16 cores. If the RDNA 3.5 architecture name looks weird to you, you're definitely not alone. But all you need to know is that it's basically the same as the RDNA 3 architecture that powered the Radeon 7000 series of graphics cards, but with some optimizations for low-power APUs."", ""Not only does the Xbox Ally X have literally double the CPU and GPU cores of the Steam Deck, but it's using much newer silicon. I won't know exactly how the new handheld performs until I get it in the lab, but I can already tell you that it's going to be much faster."", 'Winner: Xbox Ally X', ""As much as I love a high-resolution screen, Valve really did make a great choice by using an 800p display for the Steam Deck. By keeping the resolution down, more games are able to run well on the Steam Deck without having to tweak with settings too much. Yeah, 800p is arguably low-res in 2025, but that doesn't stop the Steam Deck OLED from looking incredible, especially in games like Hades."", ""The Xbox Ally X is taking a different approach with its 1080p 120Hz LCD display. Not only does it have a higher resolution, but it's also faster than even the 90Hz Steam Deck OLED, which is huge for games that can actually run that fast on a handheld."", ""The debate between fast screens and pretty screens is nothing new, so really it depends on what you're looking for. I'm a firm believer that even a lower-res OLED display looks better than a high-res LCD screen, but if you're purely after response times, the Xbox Ally X is going to be better."", 'Winner: It depends.', ""Looking back on it, it's kind of incredible that the Steam Deck was able to play so many games out of the gate, despite running on Linux. This was thanks in large part to Valve's Proton translation layer, which essentially allows the device to emulate Windows. It's not a perfect solution, but it did give the Steam Deck access to a ton of Windows games that it wouldn't otherwise have access to. But it was largely locked to Steam."", ""You absolutely could install Windows 11 on the Steam Deck and get it running the Xbox app and other launchers, but it was a massive to-do that most people didn't want to, uh, do. The Xbox Ally X, however, doesn't need a translation layer to run games."", ""The big advantage of Microsoft co-developing a handheld is that it's running Windows. Microsoft is modifying it a bit to make it easier to use on a handheld, but the guts are still the same, which means pretty much any PC game will work on the new device. So while Steam has an undeniably huge library, being able to access any game that runs on Windows automatically gives the win to the Xbox Ally X."", 'Winner: Xbox Ally X', 'Beyond a vague ""Holiday 2025"" release window, I have no idea when the Xbox Ally X will be coming out, let alone how much the thing will cost. However, it is probably going to be a bit more expensive than the Steam Deck. The Asus ROG Ally X – which launched with very similar specs but with the last-gen equivalent APU – ran for $799 at launch. Given that everything is getting more expensive this year, I would at least not expect it to be cheaper.', ""We know exactly how much the Steam Deck costs, though. You can get a base-model Steam Deck starting at $399. That'll get you a handheld with a 256GB SSD and an LCD display. You can up that cost to $549 for the OLED version with a 512GB SSD and a slightly bigger battery. Or, you can go all out for $649 to upgrade to a 1TB SSD."", ""Because Microsoft can subsidize its hardware a bit, I could see the Xbox Ally X launching for the same price as 1TB Steam Deck OLED, but not for much less. And you'd be missing out on the gorgeous OLED display."", '(Likely) Winner: Steam Deck', ""So much of what will truly make the Xbox Ally X better than the Steam Deck is kind of in limbo right now, but at least one thing is for certain: It'll be more powerful. Plus, running Windows will give it easier access to basically any PC game ever. Really, the thing I'm waiting to see is how much Microsoft can actually improve the Windows 11 experience on a handheld. If the company can even bring it close to the same ease-of-use enjoyed by the Steam Deck, it'll be a huge win for the Xbox handheld."", ""The price is likely going to be the pain point for most people. Microsoft hasn't revealed how much either of its new handhelds are going to cost, but there's a reason the Steam Deck has remained so popular, even if it looks a little long in the tooth compared to expensive devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally X."", ""For now, things are looking good for the Xbox Ally X. We're just going to have to wait and see how it does in the lab to make a definitive call in this handheld cage match."", 'Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

"Hands-On With the Xbox Ally X, the New Gaming Handheld from Asus and Microsoft",https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-xbox-ally-x-the-new-gaming-handheld-from-asus-and-microsoft,"['PC gaming handhelds have flooded the market at this point, yet with each new model or device, there are always a handful of things you wish they did better. Whether it be clunky software, uncomfortable controls, or not being able to access a certain library of games, some form of shortcoming has been present across handheld gaming PCs. But after getting a brief hands-on demo with the Xbox Ally X, I think we might be the closest we’ve been to having the ideal gaming handheld when it launches during the holiday season this year.', '', 'The Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally are the upcoming handheld gaming PCs made in collaboration between Asus (makers of the ROG Ally) and Microsoft, and they’re specifically designed for the Xbox platform. Small things like having the Xbox button to pull up the Xbox app, streamlining the app itself, and optimizing PC games so they run properly without having to fiddle with too many settings go a long way in making these appealing in a sea of options already out there. Those little things matter, but so does raw graphics power, especially if these systems are meant to keep up with PC games now and in the future.', ""So, let’s get the specs out of the way. The Xbox Ally X is the top-of-the-line model, sporting the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme APU, 24GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD powered by a 80Wh battery – the base-level Xbox Ally rocks the Ryzen Z2 A chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD with a 60Wh battery. Both use the same 7.0-inch screen, which is a 1080p (1920x1080) resolution IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and it’s capable of variable refresh rate (VRR) and FreeSync to reduce screen tearing when performance fluctuates. Nothing has been shared on battery life as it's still being tested and fine-tuned."", 'For those who don’t live in the realm of PC hardware, the AI Z2 Extreme is a newly-announced variant of the Z2 Extreme, a very powerful APU (Advanced Processing Unit) that sits at the cutting edge of all-in-one processors for portable gaming. Announced at CES 2025, it’s the new generation of the Z1 Extreme that powers the current top-level ROG Ally X, and that chip is already quite impressive. While I only got hands-on with the Xbox Ally X, we already know that the base model Xbox Ally is going to be noticeably scaled-down in performance since the Z2 A chip is much weaker than its Extreme counterpart. The Z2 Go that powers the Legion Go S was a letdown, and looking at the hard specs, the Z2 A looks to be similar, and underwhelming for pure performance. However, if this paves the way for a more affordable option that can still manage playable frame rates without sacrificing too much in visuals, that’s not a bad thing.', ""While the actual gameplay experience with the base-level Xbox Ally is still in question since I didn't get to use it, I must say that the Xbox Ally X delivers an optimal gameplay experience. I played Gears of War: Reloaded for about 15 minutes running at 1080p with high settings, AMD FSR 3.1 at Quality mode, 16x anisotropic filtering, and maintained a smooth 60 fps the entire time – it’s worth noting that the system was running in Turbo mode, which increases power to get higher performance at the expense of heat and battery life. Granted, Gears of War: Reloaded is a remaster of an Xbox 360-era game, which is not to diminish what seems to be a great overhaul of the original Gears of War, but there’s a difference between that and trying to run, say, Doom: The Dark Ages at maximum settings. That’s also to say, we’ve yet to see the full potential of the Xbox Ally X’s Z2 Extreme."", 'I’m excited to dig into performance when the time comes and benchmark more demanding games, but that’s all I can really speak to with first-hand experience. However, the meaningful leaps in tech aren’t necessarily in graphics and frame rates, because anyone who has used a Windows-based handheld gaming device knows how much a headache it is to use. The user experience of Windows 11 on the original ROG Ally fluctuates between just fine and absolutely miserable, and this is the biggest problem these new systems address.', 'The Xbox Ally systems run a super-slim version of Windows underneath the newly built Xbox app. It’s still a PC at the end of the day, but Windows has been modified to cut out unnecessary processes and defer tasks that don’t contribute to running games while still allowing for wide compatibility for other applications. And the Xbox app has evolved to be easily navigable with a gamepad while more neatly packing your library within the familiar UI. What’s even better is that the Xbox app lets you import your games from other storefronts such as Steam, Epic Games, and/or GOG so you can aggregate all your games in one place – with everything centralized in the Xbox app, it effectively functions like an all-in-one launcher.', 'There’s still room for improvement, since the design of the Xbox app itself could be more intuitive and user friendly when it comes to how games and options are laid out, and I’m hoping it makes those strides before launch as it is still an early build of the system. I’m still skeptical of its AI Copilot integration as well, which feels like it’s being wedged into places it doesn’t need to be. Yes, using a Ryzen AI processor lets something like this possible, but it being pitched as a way to ask for help and guides in games isn’t going to sell me on the idea.', 'The other major stride that comes with the Xbox Ally is its ergonomic design; think of it as an Xbox controller split in half with a screen and powerful system slapped in the middle of it. It feels like you’re holding an actual controller, so it has the comfort and performance you expect from a proper gaming platform, which was a notable downside of the original Asus ROG Ally design. I’d say it matches the Steam Deck in terms of ergonomics, but the Xbox stick layout, button feel, and impulse triggers give the Xbox Ally the edge. The downside is that this thing is quite bulky at 290.8mm wide, 121.5mm tall, and 50.7mm deep, and while the full controller-style grips are nice, I’m not sure if I’d call this thing sleek. I’m not sure if it’s the most portable device relative to its counterparts, but I suppose that’s the compromise you have to make.', 'The biggest question that now remains is price point. Powerful hardware, a streamlined operating system, and the ideal ergonomics for a gaming handheld are all key areas that are addressed with the Xbox Ally X, but it shouldn’t come at a cost that boxes out a large swath of interested folks. I suppose that’s what the lesser Xbox Ally model is for, but I’m still wary of its performance based on the on-paper specs we have for now. Asus and Microsoft aren’t sharing price ranges yet, given that it’s still a ways out and market conditions are fluctuating by the minute, but I can guarantee that this thing isn’t going to be cheap – and what I would consider “reasonably priced” for a device of this caliber would still be sticker shock in the console space.', 'Regardless of where the Xbox Ally X falls in terms of pricing, an important knock-on effect is that it’s pushing the Windows and Xbox ecosystem to better accommodate handheld PCs. With iteration, it’ll get even better and it’d be nice to see other handhelds adopt those advancements in the future. So, even if you don’t pick up an Xbox Ally X, you’ll likely see its influence in other handhelds you might be interested in, and hopefully everybody wins.', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHhNRTFtVTJWUFpVNHlRV1E1VFJEZ0FSalFBaWdLTWdrVkFKU3JLV2dlSUFN=-w280-h168-p-df

This is a very big deal, not just because it marks the first time Xbox has co-branded a console (with high-end PC specialists Republic of Gamers), but because it’s packing top-of-the-line hardware under its hood. I played the Xbox Ally X, one of two models coming before Christmas, a few hours after they were revealed during 8 June’s Xbox Showcase, and can easily see it becoming a serious competitor for both the Switch 2 and Valve’s Steam Deck.', 'The Xbox Ally springs from the coupling of four different tech firms: Windows, Xbox, AMD and Asus, and it’s definitely their golden child.

The devices both run Windows, but the team has modified it for optimal gaming.', '“We’re not loading up the Windows desktop,” Xbox Experiences VP Jason Beaumont said. “We’re not loading up the icons and the task bar and components that really aren’t about playing video games … we can save a bunch of resources and then give those to the game, so that they can perform better.”', 'You can access your collection of games with a library button on the device (there’s also a new Xbox button that functions similarly to the one on a console controller).

If you have an Xbox Game Pass subscription, hundreds of games are available to play on the Allies straight away.', 'During Microsoft’s presentation in LA, I’m handed an Xbox Ally X over my right shoulder.

During Summer Game Fest on June 8, the company debuted the console with a flashy trailer: a floating block of ice forming into the handheld before the Xbox logo cracks through and the system comes to life. Not just one, but two—the ROG Xbox Ally and its more powerful variation, the ROG Xbox Ally X—essentially a set of halved controllers comically strapped to a wide screen. Both are expected to arrive this holiday season, though details like pricing, accessories, and preorders still haven’t been announced.', 'It’s been a long wait for a true Xbox handheld. While competitors like Nintendo, Sony, and Valve have already established handheld or hybrid consoles in some form, Microsoft has been slower to commit to gaming on the go—a move that has cost it a competitive edge against the Switch or Steam Deck. For a company that’s put heavy emphasis on “Xbox anywhere,” its lack of a console you could actually play anywhere has been a major oversight.', 'The Ally consoles, which are being made with electronic manufacturer ASUS, will finally let people play games through remote play, cloud gaming, or the handheld itself. Both will run Windows 11, where your mileage may vary depending on your feelings about the divisive OS, which critics have described as annoying because of things like pop-up ads and a bad start menu. It will give players access to PC games, mod use, and apps such as Discord and Twitch, and include accessibility features found on Xbox. Fans will also be able to play games from Xbox, PC storefronts, Game Pass, and Battle.net, which will all sync between consoles, PC, and cloud gaming.', 'In an interview with The Verge last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said the company has been “learning from what Nintendo has done over the years with Switch.” He’s also expressed admiration for the Steam Deck, ROG handheld, and Lenovo handheld Legion Go. Prior to that, a leak from Microsoft itself in September 2023 included information on a “hybrid game platform,” then expected in 2028. Back when X allowed users to see other likes on posts, Xbox fans took note of Spencer-liked tweets that declared an Xbox handheld “inevitable.”', 'The race to make consoles more powerful than they’ve ever been—or to compete with PCs—hasn’t been as exciting, as the tech has steadily improved in the last decade. Instead, it’s the console you can play on a plane or from bed—anywhere without a TV setup, really—that feels truly appealing. My Xbox Series X has spent most of its life languishing on my shelf and collecting dust while my Switch is a must-have for every trip I take. Breakout titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 pulled me back to my Xbox briefly, but I, like many other gamers, want that option on the go.', 'Impressions of the handheld so far have been largely positive. “It ran nicely, felt good in my hands … the controls felt like Xbox controller grips,” wrote GameFile. “The gameplay was crisp and clear.” IGN praised its gameplay experience, but also noted that the user interface could be more intuitive. A writer from The Guardian said they “can easily see it becoming a serious competitor for both the Switch 2 and Valve’s Steam Deck.”', 'Microsoft is entering the market at a time when you can play most major video games on one handheld or another. With the Switch 2 out now, Nintendo already has a jump on the holiday season—and any potential tariffs or production problems that may occur.', 'But Microsoft has no shortage of games. During Xbox’s Summer Gamefest showcase, the company also showed off its upcoming release schedule, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outerworlds 2, a Persona 4 remake, and Hollow Knight sequel Silksong. The Ally will launch with the massively popular Roblox, the first time the game has ever been available on a handheld. That strong library of games could give Xbox the leg up it needs—or at least a fighting chance.', 'There aren’t any comments yet.', 'Be the first to start the conversation!\nYou need an account to add or like comments.', 'Deepfake Scams Are Distorting Reality Itself', 'A GPS Blackout Would Shut Down the World', 'The Rise of ‘Vibe Hacking’ Is the Next AI Nightmare', 'The US Grid Attack Looming on the Horizon', 'The Texting Network for the End of the World', 'MORE FROM WIRED', 'REVIEWS AND GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

We’ve also learned that you’ll be able to access your Steam library on both systems.', 'In terms of specifications, the ROG Ally will be powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor and the ROG Xbox Ally X with the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor.', 'What’s more, the ROG Xbox Ally has 16GB LPDDR5X-6400 and a 512GB M.2 2280 SSD.
