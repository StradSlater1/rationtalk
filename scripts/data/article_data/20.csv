The real reasons Musk is feuding with Trump,https://www.vox.com/politics/415599/elon-musk-trump-feud-bill-contracts-nasa,"['DOGE disappointment? Policies that hurt Tesla? A pulled NASA nominee? How about all of the above?', 'by Andrew Prokop', 'Limited-time offer: Get more than 30% off a Vox Membership. Join today to support independent journalism.', 'It was just last week that Elon Musk played buddy-buddy with President Donald Trump in a friendly Oval Office event that marked the end of his White House service.', 'Now — mere days later — the split between the two has become increasingly bitter, and each is going after the other publicly.', 'This spat isn’t just personal. It has major implications for the country, as Musk has chosen to come out hard against the centerpiece of Trump’s legislative agenda: his “big, beautiful bill.”', 'By Thursday afternoon, relations had deteriorated so utterly that Trump was threatening Musk’s federal contracts, and Musk was threatening to start a new party while accusing Trump of covering up “the Epstein files” to hide his own involvement.', 'The bill is packed with tax cuts, cuts to Medicaid and other programs, and new spending on Trump priorities like the border — and it would hugely increase the debt and deficit.', 'Shortly before he left his White House job, Musk raised eyebrows by saying publicly that he was “disappointed” in the House-passed bill. But now he’s gotten even more heated.', '“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted Tuesday on X. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”', '“Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok!” he added the next day. “KILL the BILL!”', 'On Thursday, Trump said in the Oval Office that he was “very disappointed with Elon.” He added: “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore.”', '“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk fired back on X. “Such ingratitude.”', 'Musk has presented his opposition to Trump’s bill — which began before he left the White House — as public-spirited and principled. But many speculate Musk has other motivations: for instance, his business interests (the bill rolls back many credits for clean energy, and for electric vehicles such as those Tesla makes).', '“‘Elon was “wearing thin,” I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted Thursday on TruthSocial.', 'The bad blood didn’t start because of the bill. The reasons for the split go deeper — involving disappointment in DOGE, a pulled NASA nominee, and a promised $100 million that didn’t show up.', 'And it may not end with the bill, either. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”', 'In the heady initial weeks of Trump’s second term, the new president initially permitted Musk to run rampant through the federal government — ordering firings, putting workers on leave, and canceling contracts in a whirlwind of activity.', 'But, as I’ve written, a key turning point came in early March when, after several Cabinet secretaries complained, Trump reined Musk in, declaring he needed to work with Cabinet chiefs and use a “scalpel,” not a “hatchet.” (And, presumably, not a chainsaw.)', 'For the world’s richest man, it was a serious step down from being the super-empowered COO of the federal government, as he basically was in those opening weeks. His failure to swing a Wisconsin Supreme Court election, despite spending nearly $25 million on it, was another blow. And he increasingly started losing internal power struggles — for instance, to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.', 'Musk reportedly asked whether the White House could find a way to extend his service beyond the 120-day time limit he had as a “special government employee” — but was told no. And his final weeks in his White House post were tense. He tried to scuttle a major AI investment deal Trump ended up announcing during his trip to the Middle East last month, out of anger that it benefited his business rival Sam Altman.', 'Trump’s team was getting increasingly frustrated with Musk too. According to the New York Times, Musk had promised $100 million to fund Trump’s political operation — but hadn’t followed through.', 'Musk’s initial comments that he was “disappointed” in the “big, beautiful bill” were followed by that friendly Oval Office send-off with Trump. But immediately afterward, the White House hit back. As soon as Musk was out of government, on Saturday, Trump yanked the nomination of a close Musk ally and friend, Jared Isaacman, to be head of NASA.', 'This looked a lot like payback against Musk. Trump claimed he pulled the nomination because he’d just learned that Isaacman had made donations to Democrats in the past. In reality, these donations had been long disclosed, and CNN reported that they’d only come up again because “a faction of people in Trump’s inner circle” had soured on Musk. (Space policy is extremely important to Musk, the CEO of SpaceX.)', 'So Musk’s attempt to foment a right-wing, Tea Party-style revolt against Trump’s bill this week may well be payback of his own — showing that he can hurt Trump, too.', 'But can he? It would only take a few defections to sink the bill, given the GOP’s slim majorities in both chambers. Yet in a showdown between Trump and Musk, few if any congressional Republicans would side with Musk — Tea Party arguments don’t resonate like they used to in the Trump era.', 'The risk, for Musk, is that — just as in that Wisconsin Supreme Court election — his attempts to swing politics end up revealing he has a lot less sway than he thinks.', 'Update, June 5, 2025, 3:45 pm ET: This story was originally published earlier on June 5 and has been updated to include new details of Trump and Musk’s public feuding.', 'Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

But it's sort of in keeping with their relationship over the last year or so, as Musk became very close to Donald Trump."", 'Inskeep: What do you mean in keeping with their relationship?', ""Swisher: Well, I think he [Musk] sort of fell in love quickly. He sort of went crazy –jumping up and down, doing the chain saw thing, dedicating his life, moving into Mar a Lago. All this stuff. shifted rather dramatically because he sort of was somewhat neutral in politics. Had voted for Obama, [and] had a relationship with Trump in the first term, but certainly wasn't as deeply in love with him. – and I hate to use these terms– but it's really been quite intense. Calling himself B.F. or best buddy or first buddy. And Trump reciprocated, too."", 'Inskeep:  What do you think drove Musk to speak out repeatedly until the president finally responded yesterday?', ""Swisher: I think he was forced out of the White House, essentially. They moved him along because of all the negatives that were starting to build up and the usefulness of Musk to Democrats –in terms of attacking a lot of things. He also disagreed a number of times. He called Peter Navarro a I think, a moron – and worse. He disagreed last year over the bill. If you remember, he started to complain publicly. And so he wasn't cooperative. He also was fighting with cabinet members, bullying people [and] staying there a lot. You know, he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom quite a bit. But last November, I kind of predicted this would happen –it would be a spectacular breakup. I used the reference for the movie Highlander, which there can be only one. And in this case, in [the]Trump world, there can be only one, which is Donald Trump."", 'Inskeep: We talk about this as a relationship, as a kind of a personal beef, but there\'s some real substance here. The question of how much does a rich person get to buy when they start paying for somebody\'s election? Here\'s another thing that\'s on my mind. The president yesterday threatened to cancel ""billions and billions"" of dollars in contracts to Musk\'s companies. He\'s got SpaceX, he\'s got satellites. He\'s got a lot of things. This is what Trump did to Harvard. This is what Trump did to law firms.: I will punish your speech. What does it say that he now threatens to do that to a right wing ally?', ""Swisher: It's in his tool bag. He does it all the time. And of course, he did it obliquely by saying, I wonder why Biden didn't do it, or here's an idea, that kind of thing. It was his veiled threat. It's a little mobster, –'it's a nice business you got there, hate to lose it', that kind of thing. It's very typical of him to do so. I don't think it's a small thing because Musk has a lot of leverage too. He has a lot of important government contracts the government relies on. He also has enormous amounts of money. This is not [like] throwing Omarosa out of the White House. This is throwing the richest man in the world who has enormous power, has a huge platform, has a lot of means and methods to strike back. So it's not the smallest thing in the world. He's picking a fight."", ""Inskeep: Musk is then saying, I'm immediately going to decommission the Dragon space capsules, which would strand people –astronauts in space."", 'Swisher: He took it back.', ""Inskeep: He took that back? Okay. He's also at the same time saying, 'What an amazing timeline I have'. That's one of his tweets yesterday. Is all of this fake? Is any of this really happening?"", ""Swisher: Everyone thinks it was fake. I think the reference to Jeffrey Epstein, sort – I first thought, oh, goodness sake, this is typical of these two. Because they're so much alike in so many ways. Everything's about look at me. They obviously didn't get hugged enough as children –either of them. But they need to be you know, they need the attention on them at all times. The thing is, this is the President of the United States [and]the richest man in the world. There's legislation that's pending. It's not a reality show. It's not a game and everything else. So when he did the Epstein stuff, I went, Oh dear, he went, he went to pedophile, which is something that. Speaking of bag of tricks, that's an Elon thing that he typically accuses people [of]. He was in a lawsuit over that issue a couple of years ago . And he did it to the speaker of the House. He does it all the time."", ""Inskeep: I want to ask about another serious potential consequence here. At the beginning of the administration, people were referring to Musk and a bunch of others as oligarchs. And so we looked into the history of so-called oligarchs in Russia. And there was a moment in Russia where there was an oligarch who had an opinion that President Vladimir Putin didn't like. And so Putin destroyed that oligarch and then all the other oligarchs and replaced them with his own people. Is that possible in the United States?"", ""Swisher: Oh, well, I guess it's possible. Trump is somewhat incompetent at being an autocrat right now. And the people do fight back. And it's a slightly different situation than Russia is and the way Putin wields power. But certainly he has lots of things at his disposal. The issue is how many people can he fight at once. He's fighting Harvard [University]. Who's pushing back. He's fighting lawyers, some of whom are pushing back. And so at some point, he's fighting too many people. He can sic the Justice Department on Musk, but then it'll be very explicit. A lot of this is so explicit. The coin operated president who gets the rich guy [and] gives him the Lincoln Bedroom for the money. All this is so explicit. It's not like it hasn't happened before. And so explicitly fighting musk will be quite something. And Musk is not without his fans and again, without tools to fight back at Trump."", ""Inskeep: I guess if you were worried about the extreme concentration of power, –the world's richest man hanging out with the world's most powerful man– it's less concentrated now."", ""Swisher: I don't know. I find it worrisome –completely worrisome– that this is what we're doing. They're not being serious people. This is ridiculous. Trump is nearly 80 years old. Musk is in his fifties.This is toddler behavior."", ""Inkseep: Bill Ackman, another billionaire part of their coalition, urging them to make peace. And Musk seems to agree on social media. You think they'll just make up somehow?"", ""Swisher: Maybe. Although I think Trump probably has had it with him, especially with the Epstein stuff.

He had spotted the truck, a heap of matte silver and sharp angles, parked on the street nearby.', 'It was the uninvited guest to an unofficial party celebrating what the MAGA faithful here view as the end of Elon Musk’s influence in President Donald Trump’s Washington.', 'The festive mood Thursday night came after an hours-long public feud between Musk and Trump that captivated Washington and appeared to mark the dissolution of the two men’s bromance. Musk spent tens of millions to help elect Trump last year before heading up a controversial cost-cutting effort over the past five months known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But Musk turned on Trump this week over the president’s massive deficit-busting tax and spending plan.', '“We’re popping bottles tonight,” said Kassam, who had just set down his tin of caviar and pearl spoon before stepping outside for a smoke break.', 'Follow Trump’s second term', 'So goes the sentiment at Butterworth’s, the French-inspired bistro on Capitol Hill that has become something of a MAGA clubhouse in Trump’s second term. Kassam, the editor in chief of the National Pulse, a right-wing populist news site, is one of the investors. And “MAGA” — Make America Great Again — is the operative adjective here. Over plates of lamb tartare and generous pours of Côtes du Rhône — perhaps the only liberal thing here — diners said their loyalties would be to Trump in the high-profile breakup.', '“This is a lesson the MAGA right needed to learn right now,” he continued. The establishment Republican Party had already gone through something similar, Kassam said, when the tea party “got bought out by the Kochs,” referring to two wealthy brothers who funded traditionalist conservative causes.', '“I was very worried for a time that MAGA would be bought out by the oligarchs, too,” he said. “And it’s just so satisfying to see that that is now no longer the case.”', 'All evening, acerbic tones of a Musk-inspired diss track could be heard across the bar.', '“What people need to remember is that, you know, this is President Trump’s movement,” said CJ Pearson, a Gen Z MAGA influencer.', '“The least-surprising thing I’ve ever seen,” said Matthew Boyle, the Washington bureau chief of the conservative news outlet Breitbart. “We were all ready for this from the beginning.”', 'Butterworth’s is a haunt of Stephen K. Bannon, the “War Room” podcast host and former Trump adviser, and his political sympathizers. Bannon never cared for Musk, who embodied the tech right and ultrawealthy interests; the two routinely clashed over the direction of Trump’s second term, with Bannon pushing a more populist, nationalist agenda. The attacks often veered into name-calling: Musk called Bannon “a great talker, but not a great doer”; Bannon called Musk a “truly evil person” and a “parasitic illegal immigrant.”', 'Bannon wasn’t at Butterworth’s on Thursday — he had spent much of the evening on the phone with reporters and allies, reveling in the moment. Phoning in to The Washington Post as a reporter was perched at the bar, Bannon said federal officials should investigate whether Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa, had legally entered the country and should deport him if he hadn’t followed all proper procedures. The Post reported last year that Musk worked illegally in the United States as he launched his entrepreneurial career after ditching a graduate studies program in California.', 'And Bannon said Trump should sign an executive order to keep Musk from interfering with government work that his companies have contracts on. Federal officials should take over Musk’s businesses, at least temporarily, Bannon said.', '“The government should seize control of SpaceX tonight through the Defense Production Act,” Bannon said. He was referring to Musk’s declaration Thursday that he would decommission the spacecraft tasked with delivering supplies to the International Space Station — a threat he later retracted.', 'And he said the government should seize Musk’s Starlink satellite company while they’re at it.', '“He’s an unstable individual who has a history of massive drug use,” Bannon said, referring to a recent New York Times report. “He should not be in charge of essential national security programs.”', 'What about that tantalizing tidbit Musk dropped on X — that Trump is “in the Epstein files”? The claim referred to convicted and deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Musk threw it like a match on his way out the door.', '“He is a national security threat,” Bannon said of Musk’s claim against Trump and his declared support Thursday for impeaching the president to replace him with Vice President JD Vance.', 'This evening at Butterworth’s, technically, wasn’t supposed to be about Musk. It was supposed to be about a plaque — specifically, one about the size of a hot dog bun, mounted near a floral pattern sofa by Butterworth’s entrance. “THE AMBASSADOR’S SOFA,” it shouted in bronze. The diplomat in question was British ambassador Peter Mandelson, who had fond notions of being served lobster thermidor “sprawled out on this sofa here.”', 'That’s what he would prefer to talk about. But he indulged The Post’s queries about Trump and Musk, too.', '“Honestly, I genuinely don’t know what Elon has said,” Mandelson said, when confronted about Musk’s recent social media posts about Trump. “But I think the office of the president should be respected at all times.”', 'If Butterworth’s is the safe space for the Trump faithful, the X social media site that he owns — formerly known as Twitter — is Musk’s. Pearson, the influencer, has seen MAGA influencers taking Musk’s side.', '“It’s completely economically motivated by some of these people who are, honestly, grifters,” Pearson said. “These are folks who depend on Elon bucks to pay their rent, and now they’re betraying their values and their principles simply because they need to make ends meet.”', 'Bart Hutchins, Butterworth’s chef and resident bon vivant, stood behind the host counter, turning to tend to a customer waiting to check in for his reservation. Hutchins, like Musk, has gone through more liberal and conservative phases — and Hutchins has liked Musk through none of them. “Elon Musk is an insufferable nerd, and I hope this marks the end of his engagement with public life,” Hutchins said.', '“He’s an aesthetic nightmare,” he added. “Like, he doesn’t have anything interesting to say.”', 'Back on the sidewalk, Kassam was twirling a cigarette between his fingertips. He was thinking aloud about Musk’s fights with conservative leaders on the international stage, such as Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s Reform Party whom Musk had harshly criticized. (Kassam, an associate of Farage, said Musk “went crawling back to him, by the way, and apologized.”)', 'There was also Peter Navarro, Trump’s longtime trade adviser and a top champion of aggressive tariffs who, like Bannon, served prison time after being found in contempt of Congress in connection with investigations of Trump. After the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariff plan, Musk posted on X that Navarro was “truly a moron.”', '“Dr. Peter Navarro went to jail for the movement and for the president,” Kassam said, while admitting he is “not even a huge fan of him personally.”', '“But he’s a made man. You don’t get to pick fights with Dr. Peter Navarro,” Kassam continued.', 'Kassam paused before lighting his cigarette.', '“What’s also really funny, what Elon doesn’t realize, is all of his DOGE people leak all around town,” Kassam said. “They talk to everyone — they talk to reporters, they talk to MAGA people, they talk to Bannon world people, they talk to everyone, because they’re not political people.', '“They don’t know how to work in this town.

President Trump is threatening to cut off billions of dollars in federal contracts with Musk after the two billionaires engaged in a dramatic online feud just days after Musk called Trump’s budget bill a “disgusting abomination.” Musk appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and claimed the president is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. “They are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos,” says author Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, who is working on a new book about Elon Musk. “This is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put … the whole future of the American economy and the political scene in the hands of two sole human beings.”', 'AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who, up until just recently, was a top presidential adviser and Trump’s top political benefactor. The fight could have broad implications for Trump’s presidency, the Republican Party and many government programs, including NASA, that rely on technology from Musk’s various companies. The feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump’s so-called big, beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” because it will increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion. The tension then escalated considerably on Thursday.', 'During a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a reporter asked Trump about Musk’s comment. This is part of his response.', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. … He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I’m sure you can get very easily — it’s very fresh, on tape — he said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.', 'AMY GOODMAN: The feud then spilled into social media, with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms, Musk on X and Trump on Truth Social.', ""At 2:37 p.m. Thursday, Trump wrote, “Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” unquote."", 'At 3:10 p.m., Musk wrote, quote, “Time to drop the really big bomb, @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”', 'Then Trump wrote, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump said.', 'Musk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency.', 'Trump ally Steve Bannon went further, calling for Musk to be investigated and deported. He also called Trump to seize Musk’s company SpaceX.', 'To talk more about the fracturing of the Trump-Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican Party, we’re joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism. He is author of Hayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right, as well as Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy.', 'Professor Slobodian, welcome back to Democracy Now! Were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday? I mean, who knows? They could be holding a joint news conference soon and announce they’re back in love.', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos. And I think that, more than anything, this is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put billions of dollars, even the lives of astronauts, the whole future of the American economy and the political scene, in the hands of two sole human beings.', 'AMY GOODMAN: When you said threaten the lives of astronauts, explain.', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, the Dragon unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from where they are now. So, were he to decommission it, it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there, kind of Gravity style.', 'So, this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers, that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing, that we feel more and more exposed to, from the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of the same internet connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government. I feel like, over time, we’ll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness, and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Let’s go from the threat to lives in space to here on the ground, Elon Musk taking on the budget, calling it an “abomination.” When Trump said he knows that — the budget bill better than almost anyone else, inside and out, Musk’s response was, “That is false. I never saw it. It was passed in the middle of the night.” Can you talk about the significance? I mean, this is the guy in charge of DOGE. How many thousands of jobs have been lost? And yet, at the same time now he’s viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed, and it could threaten its ultimate passage.', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: I mean, I think it’s worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump — right? — what he was doing with this DOGE project. And I think it’s possible to kind of split it up into three categories.', 'I think, first of all, he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy. So, I think, especially on the trade war and his many, many interests in China, you know, he has a Gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year. He wanted to get out in front of any possible excess of economic nationalism that might be rolled out.', 'And then I think he was kind of making a Hail Mary move, that, you know, he hadn’t really clicked with the Biden administration, and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations, especially in artificial intelligence, where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Altman and OpenAI.', 'And then, third, I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy, where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services, especially SpaceX, to, in fact, not only get to the moon, but divert the whole project towards Mars. So, there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved.', 'But from Trump’s point of view, he’s never really been a fiscal hawk, right? He’s always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined GOP politics for the last couple decades. So it was always kind of an odd fit, and it’s not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is, you know, not hard austerity enough for his liking. It’s telling, for example, that he’s posted multiple Milton Friedman memes over the last couple of days, sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government. But Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology.', 'And the question is: Why now has this led to a snapping point — ', 'AMY GOODMAN: So — ', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: — for Musk? And I think there’s a — ', 'AMY GOODMAN: Keep going.', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: If I could just say, I think there’s a couple of things there. I think Trump invokes the EV mandate, and that is a serious issue, right? What that is — it needs to be broken down — is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time, a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows normal ICE — internal combustion engine — vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers. And this is now 40% of Tesla’s net income in the last year. It went up a billion dollars in the last year alone. And if that gets killed, it really does kind of kill Tesla’s margin. And I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD, battery producers like CATL. And I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand, as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum. So, there’s reasons, as he returns to his businesses, to start to sweat about what he’s actually signed up for.', 'AMY GOODMAN: How about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement, and where JD Vance fits into this, the vice president?', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, it’s always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with DOGE, right? I mean, if you want to get into the real kind of Dangerous Liaisons kind of courtesanship, I think, that is happening inside of the White House, it seems that, based on reporting, Stephen Miller was kind of stage managing, along with his wife, a lot of what was happening with DOGE.', 'And if you look at what actually came out of DOGE — and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or postmortem on it, as it winds down, really — he said he was going to do 2 trillion cut — $2 trillion in cuts, out of a $6 trillion budget — very unlikely — went back to $1 trillion, scaled it back to $150 billion. What did they end up taking out? I mean, it’s basically culture war stuff, right? I mean, it’s ways to trigger the progressives and the libs — get rid of USAID, attack NEH funding, arts funding, science funding, education, energy. These ended up being big wins not really for Musk’s own bottom-line, cost-cutting mentality, but very much for the culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. So there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view. They were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed, you know, brilliant, Edison-like inventor and wonderful, efficiency-creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals.', 'But they never could bring that big number down. Why? Because entitlement spending still dominates the state spending in the GDP. And when you come close to that, you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract. And we saw the town hall meetings. We saw the anger when things started to encroach on the questions of Social Security and Medicaid. And for me, that was a very telling moment, and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise, too. He’s not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back. He’s used to interacting with a Twitter fan base, a set of really bought-in Tesla investors, for whom, you know, he always walks on water and he’s a god reincarnate. And when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal, he didn’t know what to do.', 'So, I think that there’s a kind of a — there’s a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives. They got to do some of their their easy wins against the progressives and the libs, and now they’re able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of spending, as we see in the so-called big, beautiful bill.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Finally, do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his DOGE army downloaded from all the agencies? Is that possible?', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: I am not a software programmer, and I do not know how databases work that well, but it seems at least likely that part of what they were doing there, when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them, was also harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don’t know what. Feeding the machine of Grok or xAI is the most likely answer.', 'AMY GOODMAN: And finally, let me ask you: Steve Bannon, who’s on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift, has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk’s businesses and for him to be deported, right? I mean, Elon Musk comes from South Africa.', 'QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, this actually isn’t the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said. He referred to Silicon Valley as an “apartheid state” a few months ago. The idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one. It would certainly run against the core privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades. So far, I would chalk that up to just saber-rattling rhetoric for his podcast, more than an actual policy proposal.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Quinn Slobodian, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University.

The Musk-Trump Divorce Is as Messy as You Thought It Would Be,https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-musk-trump-divorce-is-as-messy-as-you-thought-it-would-be,"['Shamelessness, defined as brazen disregard for that which might deter anyone else, has always been one of Donald Trump’s superpowers. It’s part of the alchemy by which he can ignore his own defeats, reverses, missteps, and absurd overpromises, and pretend that they either never happened or were actually proof of great success. On Wednesday, the President faced a barrage of ominous developments that might have fazed another leader—a worrisome jobs report, losses in federal court related to four of his signature policies, an increasingly vituperative public breakup with Elon Musk. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that Trump’s marquee legislative effort, the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” would add an estimated $2.4 trillion to the U.S. budget deficit over the next decade—a conclusion that only fuelled Musk’s recent attacks on it. Musk, who first broke with Trump last week over the measure, has, in recent days, urged members of Congress to “KILL the BILL,” calling it a “disgusting abomination.” So what did Trump do in response? Escalate, of course. On Wednesday evening, he announced three of his most controversial executive orders yet—barring new international Harvard students from entering the country, ordering an investigation into a crazy conspiracy theory that Joe Biden’s aides usurped the President’s powers to issue decrees by autopen, and banning citizens from twelve countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, from travelling to the U.S. The day, as with so many already in Trump’s second term, was a news anchor’s nightmare.', 'Amid so many headlines, you might have missed that Trump also spent an hour and fifteen minutes on Wednesday on the phone with Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, in a call that went so poorly that Trump’s subsequent account of it included two startling disclosures: first, “immediate peace” between Russia and Ukraine was not going to happen, and, second, Putin stated “very strongly” that Russia will retaliate in response to Kyiv’s daring surprise attack earlier this week on its strategic bomber fleet. Trump’s post about the call appeared on his Truth Social network at 1:56 p.m. on June 4th, and perhaps history will record that as the moment when one of Trump’s most flagrantly impossible campaign promises finally flamed out—his pledge, oft repeated, to instantly end the war in Ukraine.', 'Technically, Trump had long since failed to deliver on this one, given that he had insisted throughout the 2024 campaign that it would take him less than twenty-four hours to stop the fighting. (CNN compiled a non-exhaustive guide to fifty-three times he made this pledge, including saying that he would have the war “settled” even before he returned to the White House.) Until recently, Trump still claimed to be pursuing this goal, and while he admitted the obvious to Time that his self-imposed deadline was an “exaggeration” just “to make a point,” he nonetheless insisted that peace would soon be forthcoming. On April 25th, he even announced that the two warring parties were “very close to a deal” and that “SUCCESS seems to be in the future!” A week ago, Trump said that he needed just two more weeks to see what was possible with Putin. But on Wednesday came the classic Trump walk-back, never acknowledged as such but a walk-back just the same: he’d had a “good conversation” with Putin, according to his post, but not one that was going anywhere with regards to Ukraine. Back in February, Trump demanded an immediate ceasefire in the conflict; by Thursday, in a meeting with Friedrich Merz, the new Chancellor of Germany, Trump was offering only a noncommittal “Maybe it will end.”', 'At this point, Trump is unlikely to expend much more energy on failed peacemaking, and it seems clear he’s already proceeding with his real goal of normalizing relations with Russia, even without a halt to the fighting. He tipped his hand in his Wednesday Truth Social post, which quickly pivoted from the bad news about Ukraine to asking for Putin’s assistance in securing Trump’s faltering effort to secure a nuclear deal with Iran. Talk about a climbdown: Instead of treating Putin as a global pariah who launched an unprovoked invasion of his neighbor and regularly brandishes Russia’s nuclear arsenal as a form of geopolitical blackmail, Trump is now honoring the Russian President as an international statesman whose diplomatic prowess can be enlisted in the cause of nuclear nonproliferation.', 'Another of Trump’s most flamboyantly disregarded promises is at the heart of his rapidly escalating feud with Musk. In the past, Trump has pledged to begin to “pay down” the U.S. national debt, and during the campaign Musk, whom he brought in to oversee the effort, promised to make as much as two trillion dollars in annual budget cuts, which, if actually enacted and extrapolated over ten years, would in theory yield some twenty trillion dollars in savings. Not only did Musk not achieve anything like that during his brief, divisive tenure as head of a new Department of Government Efficiency but Trump’s new megabill making its way through the Republican-controlled Congress could add trillions more to the deficit. The President often relies on his supporters to swallow his gigantic flip-flops, but, even by Trump’s standards, this one’s impressive—a swing of more than twenty-two trillion dollars in the wrong direction from what he promised to what he’s actually doing.', 'Maybe Trump thought that Musk was just another always-Trumper, one of those zealous converts who will happily let their leader get away with any ideological contortion, no matter how cynical. (See: Vance, J. D.) Musk was certainly behaving like a moonstruck cultist. “I love @realdonaldtrump as much as a straight man can love another man,” he tweeted in February, during the height of their bromance.', 'But by Thursday the public break between the President and his biggest financial benefactor, which began with Musk’s sore words about Trump’s deficit-busting policies, had taken the personal turn we all knew was coming. It began during Trump’s photo op with Merz, when Trump said that he was “very disappointed” in Musk, who responded in real time on X by calling out Trump for his “ingratitude.” Responding to a video clip in which Trump claimed that he would have won last year’s election without Musk’s infusion of money, Musk wrote, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election.” Soon, Musk recirculated a meme on X of Trump as a shameless liar. It shows Trump telling an interviewer, “I have a plan to cut spending,” then brandishing a piece of paper on which he’s written the plan, which turns out to be “Increase spending.”', 'It didn’t take long before the two were in an all-out public war with each other, and it wasn’t just about fiscal planning. In a spat that showed just how much the world’s richest man and its most powerful politician resemble angry middle schoolers, Trump took to his social-media platform to announce that, in fact, Musk had been “wearing thin” and Trump had “asked him to leave.” Rather than a fight on principle about spending, Trump claimed, Musk “just went CRAZY” when Trump insisted on getting rid of the electric-vehicle government subsidies that help Musk’s Tesla car company. (“An obvious lie,” Musk soon replied. “So sad.”)', 'Trump posted that at 2:37 p.m. And he followed it with an even more explosive threat: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.” The post underscored—if it needed underscoring—that this is a battle between two hypocrites: the billionaire who claims to loathe government spending, unless it’s on his behalf, versus the President who is willing to abandon people and principles as quickly as he adopts them.', 'By 3:10 p.m., Musk was ready for the day’s “really big bomb,” as he put it, a claim about another one of Trump’s broken promises: the pledge Trump had made to reveal declassified files from the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender, which presumably include details about Epstein’s rich and powerful friends. Trump “is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote. “That is the real reason they have not been made public.”', 'And with that the internet exploded.

Trump said Musk was “wearing thin” at the White House and he “asked him to leave,” then he “just went CRAZY!” when the EV tax credit was removed from the bill.', '2:48 P.M.Musk said it’s “such an obvious lie” and “so sad” Trump asked him to leave and that he was upset over the EV tax credit.', '3:10 P.M. Musk alleged on X, without evidence, the reason the White House has yet to fully release the “Epstein files” detailing the FBI’s investigation into the late, disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein is because Trump is implicated in them.', '4:09 P.M.Musk said he would decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by NASA to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.', '4:11 P.M.

Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him.”', '4:26 P.M. Musk said Trump’s tariffs will trigger a recession in the second half of the year, after remaining mostly reserved in his previous criticism of the tariffs.', '11:16 P.M.Trump downplayed his public falling out with Musk to Politico, telling the outlet “oh it’s okay,” as White House officials were reportedly working to de-escalate the situation and set up a call between Musk and Trump.', '12:30 A.M.Musk appeared to backtrack on his earlier threat to decommission the SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft after a follower urged him not to do so, prompting the billionaire to respond “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”', '1 A.M., Friday (June 6)Musk signaled he is willing to de-escalate his fight with Trump after hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman—who is both a Trump supporter and a Musk ally—tweeted that both of them “should make peace for the benefit of our great country...We are much stronger together than apart.” Musk replied: “You’re not wrong.”', '4 A.M.The billionaire later reposted a follower who said “Republicans will likely lose the House in 2026.”', '4 A.M.Despite signals of a truce, Musk continued to attack the president’s allies, such as Steve Bannon, and Trump’s signature spending bill.', '7 A.M.The price of Tesla’s shares, which plummeted 14% on Thursday amid the clash, is up around 4.4% in premarket trading on Friday morning, after Musk signaled he is open to a truce with Trump.', '8:17 A.M.Trump told ABC News in a Friday morning interview he was “not particularly” interested in talking to Musk right now, alleging Musk has “lost his mind.”', '12:06 P.M.Trump is “thinking about” selling the Tesla Model S he bought in March, when he showcased the purchase to the media on the White House driveway in a public show of support for Musk, a senior White House official told Forbes, though The New York Times, also citing an unnamed White House source, reported the car is already for sale.', 'Otherwise, the Musk-Trump feud appeared to simmer in public as of Friday afternoon, with some speculation they could mend fences in a matter of days.', 'Musk said repeatedly last year he supports eliminating the EV tax credit—diluting Trump’s argument he only opposes the bill because it gets rid of the incentive. “I think we should get rid of all credits,” Musk said in December when asked by a reporter on Capitol Hill if he supports getting rid of the electric vehicle tax credit, Politico reported. The House-passed version of the bill would phase out the $7,500 tax credit for some EV buyers by 2026.', '$2.4 trillion.

In other tweets this week targeting the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Musk threatened Republicans who voted for it, warning that “in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people” and calling for lawmakers to “KILL The BILL.” Until Trump’s comments Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.—who shepherded the bill through the House—was the top Republican defending the legislation against Musk’s criticism. Johnson said Wednesday Trump is “not delighted that Elon did a 180.”', 'The bill, passed by the House in a party-line vote last month after last-minute revisions to appease Republican holdouts, is being negotiated by the Senate. Republican leaders have set a July 4 deadline to put the bill on Trump’s desk for signage, but GOP resistance in the upper chamber—and some expressions of regret from a few House Republicans who said they were unaware of certain provisions—threaten to delay its passage. The legislation would fulfill Trump’s key campaign promises, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, no taxes on tips and overtime and additional border security, paid for, in part, by cuts to Medicaid.', 'Tesla shares dropped 14% as Musk clashed with Trump, closing at $284.70 and completely erasing a month’s worth of gains it made in May. The fall marked the 11th-worst single trading day for the electric vehicle maker since it went public in 2010, according to FactSet. Musk, who owns about 12% of Tesla excluding options, saw his estimated net worth tumble by $27 billion to $388 billion (he still remains the world’s wealthiest person by far). Trump Media & Technology Group’s stock closed down 8% at $20.12, bringing shares to their lowest point since April 16.

While the two praised each other, their once-lighthearted rapport appeared stiff and uneasy. Musk in particular appeared to be in an odd mood, prompting social media users to claim he was “tweaking out,” suggesting he may have been under the influence of drugs, as the press conference was held hours after a New York Times report alleging Musk engaged in heavy drug use while he campaigned for Trump last year.

Trump, who overwhelmingly won the popular vote last year and a sizable social media following, has a singular platform he has shown willing to use at any moment to devastate Musk’s businesses and send stocks crashing. And Musk, not only as owner of the social media platform X but the top GOP political donor last year, wields immense power to scramble the president’s legislative agenda — with vast implications for the country’s economic future, Trump’s legacy and Republicans’ majorities in Congress.', 'Those factors are, at least in part, why Trump allies say the fight hasn’t escalated.', '“Of course,” the Trump ally added, “the MAD deterrence worked — there was no nuclear war.”', 'By Friday, mutual friends had pulled both back from the brink after a spat over the Trump-backed megabill and who should get credit for Trump winning the 2024 presidential election quickly escalated into a firestorm of personal insults and accusations. Musk on Thursday called for Trump’s impeachment and suggested he has more links to a well known sex offender than previously known, while Trump threatened to cancel the billions of dollars in government contracts that form the foundation of Musk’s businesses.', 'Emblematic of Trumpworld’s intervention, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman in a post on X urged the men to “make peace for the benefit of our great country,” adding that “we are much stronger together than apart,” a point that Musk in a separate post conceded was “not wrong.” Trump, meanwhile, in multiple telephone interviews with reporters over the last 24 hours, including POLITICO, claimed he “wasn’t even thinking about Elon” and that the two wouldn’t speak “for awhile.”', 'Amid rampant speculation about whether a call between the two men would happen, one White House official told POLITICO it was “very possible” the two wouldn’t speak on Friday, adding that it was the “most predictable schism ever.”', 'Musk on Thursday night was hinting at his desire to call a truce after a dive in Tesla’s stock price and Trump’s threats to cancel his SpaceX contracts made clear the financial stakes. As for Trump, advisers and Hill leaders are likely to push him to refocus on passing his megabill — an effort that’s likely to be far more difficult if he continues to goad Musk and the billions of dollars at his disposal.', 'Still, allies within Trumpworld hope that Musk and the president will bury the hatchet — even if some tensions simmer beneath the surface.', '“[Musk] isn’t delusional, he understands what he is and what Trump is and they’re going to kiss and make up,” said one longtime Trump friend who has also worked with Musk.', 'The tentacles of Musk’s businesses reach deep into the bowels of the federal government, creating both financial vulnerabilities for Musk and national security risks for the U.S. Slashing Musk’s contracts, as Trump threatened, would starve the tech mogul and his companies of billions in government funding — of which they have reportedly received at least $38 billion over two decades — and devastate his business empire.', 'Russ Vought, Trump’s budget director, wouldn’t rule out that possibility in a CNN interview Friday, adding that the administration recognizes “that Elon benefits from, and his companies benefit from, the taxpayer dollars.”', 'But cutting those contracts also risks crippling significant defense and space programs, including the rapid and low-cost launches the Pentagon contracts out to SpaceX. It’s a point Musk used to his advantage Thursday when he threatened to preemptively decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, which could leave NASA relying on Russia to get American astronauts to the International Space Station.', 'While Musk has since appeared to walk back that threat, he could offer his space services to an adversary like Russia or China, exposing U.S. strategies and imperiling plans to launch commercial space stations under a NASA-funded program.', 'Musk’s satellite-based internet service, Starlink, also has multiple defense contracts with the U.S. government to support military operations in remote areas. It also this spring launched a batch of next-gen spy satellites known as Starshield for the Pentagon.“If for some reason SpaceX was not launching for the U.S. military, you would just have satellites piling up waiting to launch,” said Todd Harrison, a space and defense analyst with the American Enterprise Institute.', 'SpaceX does so much classified work that it’s hard to know how far Musk’s reach extends. One example: The National Reconnaissance Office, which builds and operates the U.S. government’s most sensitive spy satellites, is relying on SpaceX for a new “proliferated layer” of surveillance satellites — an effort to get away from concentrated space assets that could be vulnerable to a Russian or Chinese anti-satellite weapon.“They have been using SpaceX to build and launch those,” Harrison said. “What we don’t know is how many more are left to be deployed … It’s a black program.”', 'The U.S.’s dependence on Musk’s businesses for many core national security operations is a microcosm of broader vulnerabilities the U.S. faces as a result of its decision to lean on both private companies and foreign governments for key portions of its national defense infrastructure — limiting the leverage it has when it needs to protect itself. Reliance on China for rare earth minerals and magnets has, for instance, weakened the U.S.’s hand on trade negotiations, which are, in part, aimed at reducing American dependence on China.', 'While many White House allies spent Friday urging the two men to make up, longtime Trump adviser and Musk nemesis Steve Bannon was still calling for all-out war.', 'Bannon is advocating that the White House use the Defense Production Act to seize control of SpaceX and Starlink, strip Musk of his government security clearances, investigate any links between Musk and China and deport the naturalized South African native. It’s unclear whether any of those proposals are resonating within the White House.', '“There’s no truce. All these people, the Ackmans, and everybody that tried to get him to deescalate, that tried to get the president to take a phone call and let Elon apologize, he just said, it’s not happening,” Bannon said in an interview. “There’s not going to be any phone call. What he did — he crossed the rubicon.”', 'Contracts aren’t the only reasons for the men to make peace, though. For as much as Musk has played sidekick to Trump the last few months, he is a cultural personality with an entire social media company at his disposal. And he knows how to wield it to devastating effect.', 'Musk sent congressional Republicans scrambling this week after his multi-day barrage of posts lambasting the reconciliation package under debate in the Senate, saying it doesn’t do enough to cut government spending.', 'Those comments jeopardized the fragile peace Speaker Mike Johnson brokered among House Republicans and the one Majority Leader John Thune is trying to negotiate in the Senate. The president’s so-called “big beautiful bill” cuts taxes and boosts border and military spending, key priorities the president needs to deliver ahead of the midterm elections or risk losing thin Republican majorities in Congress.', 'Plus, Musk has immense sums at his disposal that he could use to run ads influencing public opinion on the reconciliation package — or to issue electoral challenges to the Republicans who vote for it. Those stakes have led many in the White House to conclude that the best strategy is for Trump to put his head down and focus on reconciliation and not provoke Musk further.', 'Musk doesn’t have an infinite leash either when it comes to his extracurricular activities, acknowledging before his White House departure that he has spent “a bit too much time on politics.” Tesla sales plunged during his time in the White House, and its stock price nosedived Thursday following Trump’s threat to cut government contracts and, perhaps more important for Tesla, subsidies.', '“Bigger picture, Musk has potent tools for politics via social media and financial firepower,” said Steve Cortes, a GOP operative who led Hispanic outreach on Trump’s 2020 campaign. “He’s clearly not a populist nationalist, but hopefully he will realize that victories by the Democrats in 2026 and 2028 would be ruinous for America.”', 'Jake Traylor, Paul McLeary, Sam Skove and Eli Stokols contributed to this report.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNTJVbVJRYjBOS1FXZEpXbEpqVFJDUEF4alhCQ2dLTWdhTmVJNkhLZ2c=-w280-h168-p-df

I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.   ', 'Beyond Trump’s own public threat of retribution this afternoon, the desire within the administration to exact, or at least dangle, swift vengeance on Musk is indeed spiking. This is in part because in recent months, some of Trump’s most senior officials — Marco Rubio, Sean Duffy, Peter Navarro, you name it — have actively stewed over Musk’s intrusion into their work portfolios, finding him to be massively annoying.', '', 'This week, two Trump administration officials tell Rolling Stone that the government may not be above revamping investigations into Musk’s business empires — probes that carried over from the Biden era and ones that Musk was extremely adamant he wanted to see a second Trump administration crush, if the Tesla billionaire helped elect Trump.', '“THIS ADMINISTRATION COULD ALWAYS START THE INVESTIGATIONS AGAIN,” one senior Trump appointee messaged in all caps.', '', 'A source with knowledge of the matter says that Trump White House staff have already begun the process of making phone calls and sending messages to prominent allies of both Trump and Musk, saying they need to pick sides and that, basically, it’s the easiest choice they’ll ever make in their lives.', 'Trump slammed Musk today from the Oval Office when asked about the billionaire’s opposition to his reconciliation bill — which is currently working its way through the Senate. Musk responded by taking direct aim at the president, writing that “without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.”', '', '“Such ingratitude,” Musk added in another post. ', 'Shortly after, Trump took to Truth Social to draw a line in the digital sand, threatening Musk’s contracts.', 'In another post, the president added that “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” ', 'Musk’s meltdown continued with one of the least surprising truth bombs in recent memory. ', '“Time to drop the really big bomb,” Musk wrote, “@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” ', 'Trump’s friendly relationship with accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, has been well documented for decades. In 2019 it was reported that the president’s name appeared in a “black book” of Epstein’s clients. “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out,” Musk added in a follow up post. ', 'In the replies, another user asked Musk: “why’d you work for the guy if you knew this?” ', '', 'Musk’s various companies have benefited substantially from his relationship with the federal government. According to a February report from The Washington Post, Musk’s companies have received over $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the course of more than two decades. In the months he spent as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk meddled with contracts granted to his potential competitors, saw his own products receive favorable treatment, and meddled with regulators who oversee and investigate his businesses. ', '', 'Musk’s involvement with the federal government, including his reckless leadership of DOGE, caused consternation at his flagship companies, and Tesla’s stock once again took a nose dive today amid his feud with the president. Musk may soon find himself learning the least-guarded secret in Washington the hard way: When it comes to Trump, it’s better to be in his good graces than out of them. ', 'We want to hear it.

GOP civil war erupts as Musk ratchets up attacks on Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vs-musk-republican-civil-war-budget-bill-rcna211168,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By Chris Hayes', 'This is an adapted excerpt from the June 4 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.”', 'There’s a civil war brewing in the Republican Party and it’s threatening the centerpiece of Donald Trump’s legislative agenda: his one big, beautiful, disgusting abomination of a bill, which the Congressional Budget Office says will add almost $2.5 trillion to the deficit, while depriving more than 11 million Americans of health care coverage in the next decade.', 'To say this is leaving the Republican caucus in disarray is an understatement.', 'That bill is now meeting new resistance from far-right members of Congress, thanks to the actions of Trump’s one-time wingman, Elon Musk. Shortly after his DOGE days in the White House ended in embarrassing fashion, with a literal black eye and reports left and right about alleged drug use and other weird behavior, Musk started this week off by declaring war on Trump’s legislation. (Musk has denied the reported drug use.)', '“I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk posted on his social media platform, X, on Tuesday. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”', 'To say this leaves the Republican caucus in disarray would be an understatement. Just days ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is shepherding the spending bill through Congress, posted a photo of himself riding in style with Musk and Trump. But on Wednesday, he said he couldn’t even get Musk on the phone.', '“We’ve gotta get it done, and I think Elon understands the weight of that,” Johnson told reporters. “I hope he comes around, and I’d love to talk to him this week, and I hope he calls me back today.” (As of Thursday morning, Johnsons told reporters they were still playing phone tag.)', 'Hours after that Wednesday news conference, Musk posted a call to action against the Trump legislation on X: “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” (In case that was too subtle, eight minutes later, he also posted a movie poster for the film “Kill Bill.”)', 'But this is more than just a food fight. Remember, Musk threatened to primary Republicans who won’t toe the MAGA line. Now, the threat seems to be that he could primary Republicans who pass Trump’s bill. And so some of those Republicans are tying themselves in knots to try to keep both Trump and Musk happy.', 'When Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia was asked about Musk’s criticism, she told reporters, “Well, you know I have to agree with him on one hand. I always love it when Americans are angry at the federal government and express it … And so, do I like the price tag of the bill? No. But I want to get off the Biden and Democrat CR that this government is currently funding on.”', 'At one level, this is a story of two people with enormous egos who were never going to be content as co-presidents. But the deeper story here calls into question the entire Trump enterprise and what Trump was using Musk for, which was to make really unpopular cuts across the government.', 'Cuts that followed the Project 2025 playbook and appealed to the most hardcore anti-government extremists in the Republican base and far-right members of Congress, like the House Freedom Caucus, who want a government small enough to drown in a bathtub.', 'But as a policy, that approach is substantively disastrous and politically unpopular. It is not even popular with Trump, who has no qualms about running up massive budget deficits. He told everyone he’s not going to touch Social Security or Medicare. But he has to worry about pro-austerity Republicans, so he outsourced the austerity to Musk and DOGE. That way, Trump could say to the anti-government vanguard in Congress, “Oh, don’t worry about the deficit and the debt or spending, because I’ve got Musk going to town over there. He’s just going to cut all the stuff you don’t like, and no one in Congress is going to have to take hard votes.”', 'But this was always a dubious play. First, because what DOGE was doing was illegal, as many courts have found. Second, Musk wasn’t actually making a dent in federal spending. He decimated our international aid budget, but that was never where the big government spending was, contrary to all the lies and false conspiracy theories Musk spread.', 'Most importantly, Musk’s activities were so unpopular that the American people’s outrage blew back on Trump and the Republicans. In town hall after town hall, it became clear that Trump’s play for plausible deniability was a failure. That’s why I believe the White House didn’t keep Musk on and why he’s freelancing now.', 'Trump’s special weapon against party division has always been his cult of personality. When it comes to voting for their own beliefs or voting for Trump, Republican lawmakers almost always vote for Trump. That was enough to get the bill through the House.', 'This is the Frankenstein’s monster that Trump helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn’t like.', 'But there are Republicans, particularly in the Senate, folks such as Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who are being very vocal about wanting to scale back Trump’s legislation drastically, to pull it apart or to kill it. And now, thanks to political cover from Musk, senators such as Tuberville, Paul and Johnson may be even more emboldened to resist Trump.', 'This is the Frankenstein’s monster that Trump helped create: A guy who has virtually unlimited funds to primary politicians he doesn’t like. Musk is giving these Republicans cover to rail in the way that they are politically comfortable with — and he has a massive social media platform that he can use to supercharge the debate, just as he used it to spread totally ridiculous stories and false numbers about what DOGE has been up to.', 'That points to a real danger here: Musk’s propaganda machine now rivals Fox News in its ability to influence and target the right wing of the Republican Party. It seems Trump is discovering that his oligarchy would be great … if it weren’t for the oligarchs.', 'Chris Hayes hosts “All In with Chris Hayes” at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on MSNBC. He is the editor-at-large at The Nation. A former fellow at Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics, Hayes was a Bernard Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation.

I knew Trump and Musk would break up. I didn't know they'd do it on their own social media networks.,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-musk-twitter-x-truth-social-platform-power-2025-6,"['It was easy to predict that Elon Musk and Donald Trump would break up someday. Even the dummy typing this imagined it.', ""What I didn't imagine was that the divorce between two of the most powerful men in the world would play out on rival social platforms."", 'Musk is tweeting away on the thing many of us still call Twitter — which he owns, of course — and Trump is firing back on Truth Social — the would-be Twitter rival he owns.', ""First and foremost, the spectacle of two billionaires having a potentially deeply consequential flame war is … truly something. When Jack Dorsey and crew were dreaming up their microblogging service nearly 20 years ago, they weren't dreaming of this."", 'But the fact that it\'s happening on two different social networks is also fascinating. And it underscores that ""social networks"" isn\'t always the best way to think about these platforms. At least when it comes to their mega-rich, mega-wealthy owners, these things are simply megaphones to holler at the world.', 'Trump, recall, became a surprisingly effective Twitter troll in the run-up to his first election, and especially once he took office. He became expert at ""programming"" the news by tapping out a few incendiary lines on his Twitter account, and reveling in the chaos that could create. (The guy typing this made a pretty good podcast about all that.)', 'Then Twitter banned Trump, which by all accounts deeply upset Trump, and that banishment helped prompt Musk to buy Twitter, and then reinstate Trump.', 'But in the meantime, Trump had created his own Truth Social network as a Twitter alternative. And Trump has both a legal obligation and a financial imperative to post on Truth Social first.', 'A license agreement with Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, requires Trump to post all ""non-political social media"" items to Truth Social first, then wait six hours before running them anywhere else. More important: If the guy who owns the social media platform isn\'t using the social media platform for his social media, why would anyone else use it?', ""Even after Musk and Trump merged forces last summer, Trump still spent almost no time on Twitter. Instead, he's kept plugging away on Truth Social."", ""And what's happened since — and especially now — forces us to rethink how these platforms work."", ""For instance: Lots of people who used to use the platform formerly known as Twitter thought that removing Trump from Twitter would diminish his power. But that obviously wasn't true. Trump crushed all comers in the last Republican primary, and won a meaningful victory in last fall's general election, despite little-to-no presence on Twitter."", ""More important is that Trump's ability to make the world turn based on his words isn't dependent on Twitter at all. He's the President of the United States, so whatever he says, whenever he says it — on a Truth Social post, on the White House lawn, aboard Air Force One — gets instantly amplified, oftentimes with great consequence. Trump could spout off on Tumblr or Friendster (I just Googled — Friendster still exists) and his message would get out there."", ""At the same time, Trump's presence on Truth Social doesn't seem to have meaningfully boosted usage on that platform."", ""We can't measure that with traditional metrics — because, tellingly, Trump Media continues to not provide any metrics about how many people use the service — but on vibes. You may read plenty of stories about how Trump posted something on Truth Social, but what about anyone else?"", ""Meanwhile, the things we can see from Trump Media don't suggest the platform is booming: In 2024, the company's meager revenue line actually declined by 12% over the previous year. Even more telling may be the company's seeming pivot into life as a bitcoin repository — which may turn out to make a lot of money for Trump and his partners, but doesn't suggest a real interest in running a media platform."", ""And at the same time, a Trump-less Twitter has … I don't know if thrived is the right word. A meaningful number of influential users and big advertisers have left the service, and its financial condition seems hopeful at best."", ""But despite the rise of would-be challengers, Twitter remains the most prominent place for public, real-time chatter, more or less by default. That's why people who tell you social media isn't great for you still use Twitter when they want to insert themselves into the conversation — like The New York Times' Ezra Klein did last year during crucial points in the election cycle."", ""That speaks to the stickiness of social networks, and how hard it is to replicate them somewhere else. But again, that isn't relevant to Musk's use of the platform to attack Trump: Musk could print out all of his insults on paper and they'd still carry the same weight and import."", ""Put it another way: Mark Zuckerberg owns multiple huge social networks. If he were going to join this brawl, it wouldn't matter which one of them he used to come over the top rope. All that would matter is the world's second-richest man was in the fight, too, and anything he said or did would be covered by everyone, everywhere."", 'So cut to Thursday, when Trump has been calling to cut ""Billions and Billions of Dollars"" from the federal budget by ""terminat[ing] Elon\'s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts"" and Musk is accusing Trump of suppressing embarrassing information about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein because Trump ""is in the Epstein files.""', ""The insults and threats are being lobbed from different platforms — and are at the same time directly responding to each other but also pretending the other one doesn't exist.

The Worst Part of Donald Trump’s Fight With Elon Musk,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/trump-musk-budget-bill-spacex-tesla/,"['Mother Jones illustration; Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP; Matt Rourke/AP', '', 'Last fall, members of the California Coastal Commission criticized Elon Musk’s political rhetoric during a meeting in which they voted against allowing SpaceX—Musk’s rocket company—to conduct more launches. Musk, one commissioner complained, had been “hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking FEMA while claiming his desire to help the hurricane victims with free Starlink access to the internet.”', '“Incredibly inappropriate,” Musk tweeted in response. “What I post on this platform has nothing to do with a ‘coastal commission’ in California!”', 'The commissioners’ behavior amounted to “naked political discrimination…in violation of the rights of free speech and due process,” SpaceX has charged in its ongoing lawsuit against the agency. “Rarely has a government agency made so clear that it was exceeding its authorized mandate to punish a company for the personal political views and statements of its largest shareholder and CEO.”', 'I couldn’t help thinking of that incident yesterday, as Donald Trump—the man Musk once promised would protect free speech and “preserve the Constitution”—weaponized his government power against a political enemy in a way that Golden State bureaucrats could hardly dream of. And that political enemy was none other than Musk himself.', 'Importantly, yesterday’s meltdown seems to have grown largely out of policy and personnel disputes. In particular, Musk has enraged the White House by calling on lawmakers to sink Trump’s signature budget bill—supposedly because it would add too much to the deficit. (It would also eliminate electric vehicle incentives that benefit Tesla, though Musk insists that isn’t why he’s trying to kill the legislation.)', 'But as the two billionaires traded insults and allegations, it was the president who took the fight to a lawless new level. He seemingly threatened to retaliate against his former ally by cancelling the government contracts held by Musk’s companies.', '“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”', 'Some Trump allies went even further. Steve Bannon called on Trump to “sign an executive order” seizing control of SpaceX, suspend Musk’s security clearances, and possibly have him deported from the country. “He crossed the Rubicon,” Bannon told NPR. “You can’t sit there and…try to destroy the bill. You can’t come out and say kill the president’s most important legislative occurrence.” Bannon also slammed Musk for calling for Trump’s impeachment and for attempting to link the president to Jeffrey Epstein.', 'Musk, of course, is not a sympathetic figure. If he got his way, Trump’s budget bill would hurt even more people than it already does. Nor is Musk anything close to a reliable defender of free speech. He’s done nothing to stop Trump from using presidential power against other political enemies. But in a democracy, politicians simply cannot be allowed to punish dissent by threatening to destroy the businesses of people who cross them—whether those businesses are media companies, law firms, or a defense contractor run by the world’s richest man.', 'After his felony conviction in New York last year, Trump claimed to be the victim of political persecution. “If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone,” he said. That’s worth remembering. If Trump can do this to Elon Musk, he can do it to you.', '', '', '“Lying.” “Disgusting.” “Scum.” “Slime.” “Corrupt.” “Enemy of the people.” Donald Trump has always made clear what he thinks of journalists.
