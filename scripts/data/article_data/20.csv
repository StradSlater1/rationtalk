Discovery on Monday made it official, unveiling plans to separate the company, in a tax-free transaction, into two publicly traded companies, “enabling each to maximize its potential.”', 'The Streaming & Studios company will consist of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, as well as their legendary film and television libraries. The second business, Global Networks, will include such entertainment, sports and news television brands around the world as CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as the profitable Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report (B/R). \n \nDavid Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros.

Both will continue in their present roles at WBD until the separation.', '', 'The split is expected to be completed by mid-2026, “subject to closing and other conditions, including final approval by the Warner Bros. Discovery board, receipt of tax opinions and/or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and market conditions,” the conglomerate said.\n \n“The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world,” Zaslav said in a statement. “It’s a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history.”', 'He added: “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape.”\n \nHis CFO highlighted that the separation would “invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles.”', '', 'Continued Wiedenfels: “This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value.

We’ve transformed our direct-to-consumer offering, as HBO Max is now one of the world’s few global and meaningfully profitable streaming services. And by fusing creative brilliance with operational excellence, we have made strong progress in returning our film and television studios to industry leadership.”', '', 'In his memo, Zaslav highlighted what he feels is needed ahead. “As we look at our industry today, we see these forces of generational industry disruption only accelerating,” ge write. “To lead in this new world, we must operate with greater speed, sharper focus, and more creative freedom.”\n ', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
Warner Bros. Discovery will split into two separate companies,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-06-09/warner-bros-discovery-will-split-into-two-companies,"['Warner Bros. Discovery is dividing its assets into two separate publicly traded companies, the media conglomerate announced Monday.', 'The move will put the company’s iconic movie studio, television production, HBO and HBO Max and DC Studios into a single entity known as Streaming & Studios. Cable channels CNN, TNT, Discovery and its European over-the-air networks will operate under the banner of Global Networks.', 'The split is a recognition the merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery three years ago was a flop.', 'Chief Executive David Zaslav’s strategy back then was bigger is better. But Wall Street soured on that debt-heavy consolidation that married nearly two dozen basic cable channels, including HGTV and Food Network, with the prestige properties of HBO and the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank.', 'With the breakup, which is expected to be complete by mid 2026, executives hope to attract investors in the company’s growing streaming business without exposure to the mature traditional TV business, which is in steep decline.', '“The decision to separate Warner Bros. Discovery reflects our belief that each company can now go further and faster apart than they can together,” Zaslav, the chief executive, told investors on a conference call.', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', '', 'Zaslav will head the Streaming & Studios unit. Gunnar Wiedenfels, chief financial officer of Warner Bros. Discovery, will serve as president and CEO of Global Networks. Both will continue in their present roles at WBD until the separation.', 'Warner Bros. Discovery’s beleaguered shares surged briefly on Monday’s news. But throughout the day, gains were erased and Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock ended down nearly 3% to $9.53 a share.', 'The combined company is currently worth $23.5 billion — a more than 60% loss in value since April 2022, when Warner Bros. Discovery was created.', 'Zaslav orchestrated that $43-billion merger by combining his smaller Discovery with Warner and HBO portfolio, then owned by AT&T. The Dallas phone company had taken a blood-bath in its four-year foray into entertainment and was eager to exit.', 'Since then, Warner Bros. Discovery has cut thousands of employees, projects and other expenses to pay down the enormous debt to finance the 2022 merger. The company’s cable channels were hit with another round of layoffs just last week.', 'Downsizing in every corner left Warner Bros. Discovery without resources to effectively compete against Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which have built streaming services that boast something for everyone, which had been Warner Bros. Discovery’s original ambition.', 'L.A. INFLUENTIAL', '', 'Instead, the company’s focus became paying down its debt. It has successfully retired about $20 billion, but the company still is grappling with $33 billion in debt from the merger.', 'S&P Global Ratings last week downgraded the company’s debt to “junk” status, citing its continued challenges with linear cable channels. Last summer, the company took a $9-billion write-down to reflect the lower value and subdued outlook for the basic cable channels.', 'Over the last three years, Zaslav-led initiatives, including folding the smaller Discovery+ streaming service into HBO Max, failed to create the desired bounce. Discovery has long been known for its low-cost, nonscripted programming such as “Naked and Afraid” on Discovery, “90 Day Fiance” on TLC and “Beat Bobby Flay” on the Food Network.', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', '', 'In another effort to give the streaming service mass-audience appeal, Zaslav and his team stripped “HBO” from the title of the streaming service two years ago, calling it simply “Max.”', 'Last month, the company announced another reversal by restoring the HBO name to the streaming service, which has seen growth with HBO shows such as “The White Lotus” and the Max original, “The Pitt.”', '“We feel like we’ve found a very compelling strategy of quality,” Zaslav told analysts.', 'The Discovery+ streaming service will be shuffled into the Global Networks company.', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', '', '“The diverging fortunes of streaming and traditional pay TV have been unmistakable for years, so it was only a matter of time before the dominoes started falling,” Paul Verna, Emarketer’s vice president of content, said in a statement.', '“Like the recent pivot by WBD to revert back to the previous name of its flagship streaming service, HBO Max, this move reveals a company fumbling its way through disruption,” Verna said.', 'Investors also have expressed dismay with Zaslav’s and other executives’ fat compensation packages.', 'Last year, amid the company’s swooning stock price and asset write-downs, Zaslav was awarded $51 million in compensation. In a nonbinding vote, nearly 60% of Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders last week voted against the 2024 compensation packages during the annual meeting, according to a regulatory filing.', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', '', 'Next year’s split is envisioned to be a tax-free event for stockholders, who will receive shares in both companies.', 'Warner Bros. separately said it had lined up a $17.5-billion bridge loan from JPMorgan Chase & Co., which is expected to be recapitalized before the spinoff. That loan will help the company as it seeks to parcel its current debt load between the two companies.', 'The cable network business — which still generates the majority of the company’s earnings — will bear the brunt of the debt load, the executives said.', 'Under the deal, the Global Networks firm will keep a 20% stake in the studios company, giving it revenue opportunities to help pay down debt.', 'Both entities could become attractive targets for takeover by larger media companies.', 'Apple, NBCUniversal or Paramount Global (should it finalize its sale to David Ellison’s Skydance Media) may be interested in combining its streaming service with HBO Max and absorbing Warner Bros.’ once-industry-leading studio operations.', 'HOLLYWOOD INC.', '', 'Zaslav has hinted at the split since Comcast announced last summer that it was putting MSNBC, CNBC, the Golf Channel, USA Network and other outlets into a new company called Versant, separating the mature businesses from the rest of the company as it focuses on streaming.', 'Comcast has said Versant would have the financial muscle to buy other cable channels, and Global Networks could make a good fit, although there may be regulatory concerns that come from combining such a huge share of the market as well as Versant’s MSNBC with CNN, owned by Warner Bros.

Warner Bros.

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'Warner Bros. Discovery announced Monday morning that it was splitting into two separate public companies by the middle of next year, in yet another major upheaval of a media conglomerate as the industry looks to transition from cable subscriptions to streaming.', 'One company will focus on the HBO Max streaming product and WBD’s film studios, while the other will be a global networks brand that will largely include cable channels such as CNN, TNT and Discovery, as well as some streaming options.', 'Current Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will oversee the streaming and studios business. Gunnar Wiedenfels, CFO of WBD, will head up the global networks company. Both will remain in their current roles until the separation, which is slated to take place in mid-2026.', ""“The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world. It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history,” Zaslav stated in a press release. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape.”"", '“This separation will invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles. This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value,” Wiedenfels added. “At Global Networks, we will focus on further identifying innovative ways to work with distribution partners to create value for both linear and streaming viewers globally while maximizing our network assets and driving free cash flow.”', 'The move is similar in scope and style to Comcast’s announcement last year that it was spinning off the majority of its cable assets into a separate standalone business. That publicly traded company, now known as Versant, comprises NBC Universal’s cable news channels MSNBC and CNBC, along with several other networks.', 'That move sparked speculation that other media giants would also look to consolidate and restructure, especially as cord-cutting continues to hamper the cable business.', 'The company seemed to hint at the upcoming split late last year when it announced a restructuring plan that would move its linear networks and streaming units into separate divisions. At the time, WBD said the new global linear networks division would be home to its news, sports, scripted and unscripted programming networks, which include TNT, CNN, HGTV, TBS and the Food Network. The streaming and studios division would house HBO Max and the company’s film studios.', 'Since the Warner Bros. Discovery merger was finalized in 2022, Zaslaz has devoted much of his energy to shedding much of the company’s massive debt load, which has seen him cut $21 billion in the past three years. All of that slashing and cutting, however, has made Zaslav a somewhat unpopular figure among the rank-and-file at the company, especially at networks such as CNN, which have taken on the brunt of Zaslav’s penny-pinching.', 'He’s also overseen some moves that have led many to question his credibility. There was the embarrassing rebrand of HBO Max to just MAX, which the company finally decided to undo earlier this year. WBD also lost its media rights to the NBA, once the crown jewel of TNT Sports. His accounting methods, which have included shelving already finished films, have resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery alienating much of Hollywood.', 'Meanwhile, Zaslav and Wiedenfels came under additional scrutiny and criticism earlier this month during the annual shareholders’ meeting. With the share price down for the year at the time of the meeting, shareholders overwhelmingly voted to reject the company’s 2024 executive pay package, which was seen as a direct rebuke of Zaslav’s exorbitant salary north of $50 million a year.', 'The vote, however, was non-binding, but it sent a clear message to the C-suite.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

New Cleaving of Warner Bros. Discovery’s Studio Business from Its Cable Channels Will Do More Than ‘Unlock Value’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/analysis/warner-bros-discovery-film-cable-channels-division-analysis-1235130830/,"['', 'We’ve heard these phrases before: “unlock value,” “maximize potential,” “leverage strengths.” All three were used in Warner Bros. Discovery‘s corporate press release on Monday morning announcing that the David Zaslav-led company will now look to become two separate companies, one housing the film studio, HBO, and streamer, and the other housing all of Discovery’s old cable channels.', 'We had a feeling this would happen sooner or later. Cable — or linear TV — is dwindling, even if it still brings in cash. And when Comcast did its own spin of cable channels with a company now called Versant (“SpinCo” had a nice ring to it), we wrote that it’s a new shortcut for a constantly consolidating Hollywood to unburden the “good stuff” from the “bad stuff.”', '', 'But to many it probably sounds like “unlocking value” translates to “make more money for shareholders.” Yeah, there’s certainly that. But the idea is that once the two different facets of the business are free from each other, one might be able to merge with or acquire something else, it could mean selling an asset, or it could be the difference in keeping a network afloat.', '', 'The deal for the spin won’t close until mid-2026, and WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will be the new CEO of the spun-off company. So while this might not mean much in the shortest of terms, long term it provides some opportunity that wasn’t possible at Warner Bros. Discovery as the company was currently constructed. The vision was certainly loftier when Warner Bros. merged with Discovery just three years ago, so it’s easy to see this as Zaslav waving the white flag on cable channels he once considered his calling card.', 'We’ll start on the studio side of things. The “Streaming & Studios” company will be made up of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max (including its international sports offering), Warner Bros. Games, Tours, Retail and Experiences, as well as studio production facilities in Burbank and Leavesden.', 'This is the growing part of the company, with HBO Max recently profitable, DC Studios burgeoning with the impending release of “Superman,” Warner Bros. Games looking to find another hit like “Hogwarts Legacy,” and WB, WBTV, and HBO continually pumping out hits. But as Zaslav said in a morning investors call, it’s also the more volatile and unpredictable of the two.', '“I think the thing that I feel best about is we put real discipline around it, but our overall content is underused — our great iconic content — rather than overused,” Zaslav said. “So we’ll be going more and more to the best content that we have, that people see and love all around the world, whether that’s Lord of the Rings or DC. [WBD film chiefs Mike DeLuca and Pam Abdy] are really looking at mining the big brands. We’re still going to do a lot of original, but mining those big brands that give us a real advantage in the marketplace.”', '', 'Warner Bros. Discovery has roughly $37 billion in gross debt (a number it has whittled down through content much loathed content write-offs and layoffs), and a big chunk of that is going to be sticking with the other company, not with the studios. So for one you would hope another “Batgirl” or “Coyote vs. Acme” debacle is a thing of the past. Could it also mean a little more content spend down the road, or more hands on attention from Zaslav in improving HBO Max?', 'It would also make it a whole lot easier for Zaslav to sell the whole thing to a company like Apple or sell off individual parts to other buyers who can do more with it than WBD can. The gaming division is one some analysts have previously eyed as something that could be on the move. The film studio and its 100+ year library of movies is also dang valuable, now even more so since it’s not saddled with dying cable networks and a mountain of debt, but that’s less likely since it’s the “crown jewel” of the whole .', 'Much of the same could be said of the “Global Networks” that will form the new company, which includes TNT, TBS, CNN, Discovery channels such as HGTV and Food Network, the streaming service Discovery+, the sports brand Bleacher Report, and the eventual latest iteration of CNN’s streaming plan. The spun company is also getting WBD’s domestic sports rights, so that gives it a bit more firepower when negotiating future carriage deals.', '', 'It too could look to sell some assets from that portfolio. Does CNN fit in with that larger picture, or can someone else do more with it? How valuable is TNT without the NBA moving forward? The other option could be a merger. A spun-off mix of WBD’s cable assets could marry quite well with everything Comcast spun off, and becoming a juggernaut of linear cable networks could be the only path forward for the medium. In December, we even speculated that Fox could be a good partner since what WBD has always lacked is a broadcast channel.', 'All of this is still a risk. Last July, Lightshed analyst Rich Greenfield suggested divorcing cable from the studios and streaming would be “irresponsible,” as it needs the cash flow from cable to help grow the streaming business.', 'It’s also a last resort. The combination of all these assets back in 2022 was meant to make it compete with Disney and Netflix, not tank its stock price over three years. Whatever the future, the goal posts for “maximizing potential” have shifted.', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"“Majority” of Warner Bros. Discovery’s $37 Billion in Debt Will Be Spun Off With TV Networks, Its CEO Says",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-debt-billions-to-tv-networks-company-1236259848/,"['', '', 'But “a not-insignificant portion” will remain with Streaming & Studios — and with David Zaslav.', 'BY TONY MAGLIO', '“It’s safe to assume that the majority” of Warner Bros. Discovery’s roughly $37 billion in debt load will exist with the spun off Global Networks, the new company’s new president and CEO Gunnar Wiedenfels said on Monday. “A not-insignificant portion” will remain with Streaming & Studios, Wiedenfels said, which will remain under the eye of current WBD president and CEO David Zaslav.', '“It’s too early to talk about a target capital structure. We haven’t made final decisions yet, and you know, there’s a lot we need to work through between now and when this when this deal closes,” Wiedendfels told media analysts on a conference call. “A couple of things can be said, though. Number one, it’s safe to assume that the majority of the debt is going to live with global networks and a smaller portion — but a not-insignificant portion — on Streaming & Studios as well.”', '', 'At the end of March, Warner Bros. Discovery had gross debt of $38.0 billion, which is comprised of “total debt” ($37.4 billion) and financial leases ($535 million). The 2022 merger of WarnerMedia (owned by AT&T) and Discovery, Inc. created more than $50 billion of debt.', 'Earlier on Monday, June 9, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a split that most of the industry saw coming. There will be two independently-operated, publicly-traded companies: Streaming & Studios and Global Networks. Those will be renamed at some point (and probably “Warner Bros.” and “Discovery” — again).', 'It is a very similar move to what NBCUniversal recently did to form Versant. Disney has also toyed with the idea.', 'Wiedenfels, currently the WBD chief financial officer and Zaslav’s longterm right-hand man, expects his coming company, Global Networks, to “continue to see strong cash generation.” Though cable TV is dying, it still generates cash flow — especially CNN, which heads out with Wiedenfels.', '', 'Both Wiedenfels and Zaslav will continue in their present roles at WBD until the separation, which is expected to close in mid-2026.', 'Zaslav’s Streaming & Studios company will consist of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, as well as their legendary film and television libraries. The second business, Global Networks, will include entertainment, sports and news television brands around the world as CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as the profitable Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report (B/R).', 'In other words, Zaslav gets the cool, creative stuff; Streaming & Studios has all of the prestige and most of the future. Wiedenfels will be in charge of much of what presently makes reliable money, but he also inherits all of the downside based on industry trends. And oh yeah, most of that debt.', '“Three years ago, the very foundation of how, when, and where audiences engaged with content was undergoing fundamental change,” Zaslav wrote in a memo to staff, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, in reference to the 2022 combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery. “As both organizations contemplated their futures, one truth became clear: to successfully adapt, transform, and lead in the entertainment industry of tomorrow, we needed to come together — to draw on each other’s strengths.”', '', 'Not that it was always easy.', '“While the work since that merger has been challenging at times, ultimately, we have succeeded in strengthening each element of our business,” Zaslav said in the memo. “By bringing together the Discovery and Turner networks, we have created a leader in live and unscripted television, with a truly global footprint operating at industry-leading margins. We’ve transformed our direct-to-consumer offering, as HBO Max is now one of the world’s few global and meaningfully profitable streaming services. And by fusing creative brilliance with operational excellence, we have made strong progress in returning our film and television studios to industry leadership.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Discovery intends for the corporate breakup to take effect by mid-2026.', 'Monday’s announcement is Warner Bros. Discovery’s answer to investor pressure and intensive industry-wide change. As the cable television business contracts in the streaming era, Zaslav is offering shareholders a way to invest in the growing HBO Max part of the business without exposure to cable.', 'That said, the networks that are part of the second company continue to boast strong profits and global audiences.', '“This evolution isn’t a departure from our strategy — to deploy Max globally, optimize our global networks and return our Studios to industry leadership — it’s about unlocking the full potential of two strong businesses,” Zaslav told staffers in an internal memo. “Each has a distinct focus, a clear mission, and the scale to succeed on its own terms.”', 'The breakup comes only three years after the combination of Discovery and the old Time Warner took effect to great fanfare. Shares in Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) have fallen by about half since then.', 'On Monday morning the shares rallied more than 10% on the news of the split, but ultimately closed down about 3%.', 'Monday’s breakup announcement had been expected because Warner Bros. Discovery has spent the last six months restructuring itself with an eye toward a split. Comcast is currently going through its own version, though that one is structured as a spinoff of cable assets rather than a split into two publicly traded companies.', 'When the 2022 deal took effect WBD carried more than $50 billion in debt. The company has made great strides in reducing the debt load; still, debt was cited as a factor in S&P Global Ratings’ decision to downgrade the company’s stock last month to “junk” status.', 'The primary reason S&P cited was “continued revenue and cash flow declines at its linear TV operations.”', 'Most of the remaining $37 billion in debt “is going to live with global networks,” with a “not-insignificant portion” going with the streaming side, Wiedendfels told analysts on a Monday morning call.', 'Although WBD’s best known streaming brands will be part of “Streaming & Studios,” the networks company will also have some streaming assets of its own, including Discovery+ and Bleacher Report. CNN is also building a new streaming service that will launch later this year.', 'CNN has been through multiple corporate reconfigurations in recent years. The network’s founder Ted Turner said in a statement Monday that he wishes “all the best” for CNN ahead of the next transition.', '“While I haven’t been involved with CNN and its operations for more than two decades, I continue to hold deep affection for the company, its leadership, and the dedicated employees and staff,” Turner said. “I have the utmost respect for the important work CNN does, and I wish them all the best as they navigate this new chapter following the recent announcement of the planned split.”', 'This story has been updated with additional context and developments.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Discovery — the toddler-age, debt-laden corporate entity that controls HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, the Discovery stuff, and the streaming identity crisis known as (HBO) Max — is splitting up the business. CEO David Zaslav has turned his eye to his own merged company and decided that, actually, it was time to break it up again. The future of “Warner Bros. Discovery” will look a little bit like the individual Warner Bros. and Discovery entities of yore and a lot more like Comcast’s recent spinoff of its NBCUniversal portfolio, another conglomerate that needed to offload declining businesses. The death of WBD will birth two new companies, one of which will focus on streaming and content production, while the other will house most of WBD’s traditional television properties.', 'It’ll break down like this: Zaslav will lead as CEO a new so-called “Streaming & Studios” company made up of WB Television; WB Motion Picture Group; DC Studios; HBO and HBO Max (including its international sports offering); WB Games; WB’s tours, retail, and experiences business; and production facilities in Burbank and Leavesden. The current CFO of WBD, Gunnar Wiedenfels, will lead a new “Global Networks” company that includes WBD’s sports and news television brands like CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery; European free-to-air channels across Europe; and digital operations like Bleacher Report and the Discovery+ streamer. The split will be a tax-free transaction, and both “Streaming & Studios” and “Global Networks” (placeholder names, we have been assured) will live on as publicly traded entities.', 'The rationale behind all of this? “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” Zaslav said. What this means for much of the Discovery+, CNN, sports, and other content that currently lives on the combined Max platform (due to un-rebranding itself back to “HBO Max” this summer) wasn’t immediately clear.', 'The decision comes less than a month after Zaslav et al. ditched the “Max” branding for the company’s flagship streaming service and less than a week after WBD shareholders rejected the embattled CEO’s pay package of more than $50 million in a symbolic (but nonbinding) vote. In 2024, while the stock of competitors like Netflix and Disney grew by 80 and 24 percent, respectively, WBD’s dropped by 7 percent. Since the WBD merger was announced, Zaslav’s name has become synonymous in Hollywood with bean counting, cost cutting, and brand annihilation.', 'In this latest move, Zaslav’s pulled from the playbook of Comcast, which spun its TV assets into a company called SpinCo, later renamed to Versant. That company also beat a deliberate retreat from broadcast news and traditional cable channels, with MSNBC, CNBC, and channels like USA, Oxygen, E!, and SYFY going to Versant, while Comcast retained its streaming business Peacock, the reality-TV money printer named Bravo, Universal Studios, and its theme parks. By retreating from news and cable, CNN’s own media analyst Brian Stelter wrote this morning that “Zaslav is offering shareholders a way to invest in the growing HBO Max part of the business without exposure to cable.” Declining linear viewership and news operations the president hates?

Another company, described as “Global Networks,” will run entertainment, sports, and news television brands, including CNN, Bleacher Report, the Discovery Plus streaming service, TNT Sports in the US, and Discovery TV channels across Europe.', 'WBD had previously announced plans in December to restructure its business into two operating divisions, with WBD serving as the parent company.

Bleacher Report is also tagging along with the spin-off.', 'It’s a move not unlike Comcast’s recent decision to offload USA Network, MSNBC, CNBC, E!, Oxygen, Syfy, and Golf Channel into its own side hustle, Versity. Think of it as amputating a necrotic limb so the rest of the body can survive while the limb rots in peace. Sure, for now, there’s still plenty of cash in those cable networks, since cable subscribers continue to shell out $80 a month to subsidize 75 channels they never watch just to get Fox News and ESPN. But as Fox News and ESPN spin off into their own streaming platforms, those lucrative carriage fees will dry up, and that dying limb will need new blood to keep twitching. Eventually, it might make sense for Versity and this new spin-off company to merge into one giant, useless blob of cable television detritus and rebrand as a FAST network, like Tubi, because that’s the only way it sustains itself.', 'The split is expected to happen around mid-2026, so for the next year or so, the HBO Max app will presumably continue to carry CNN Max and episodes of Polyfamily, though if you’ve opened the app lately, you’ll notice most of the Discovery content has already been buried.', 'Zaslav will oversee the HBO side of the business, while WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels gets stuck with the less glamorous gig as President and CEO of the Global Networks company. Which honestly seems backwards. Zaslav came from Discovery, he masterminded this whole ill-conceived merger, and if there’s any justice, he should be the one stuck babysitting the dying half of the company he created.']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Zaslav’s vision board, which includes him sitting behind Jack Warner’s old desk and living in Robert Evans’ former home, is complete.', 'On Monday, we finally got the news we were waiting for: Warner Bros. Discovery, formed just three years earlier via the merger of Zaslav’s Discovery, Inc. and AT&T’s WarnerMedia, is being split back up. Zaslav keeps the goods: HBO, HBO Max and the Warner Bros. studios (including TV and DC). His righthand man, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels, gets the leftovers — the cable channels, basically. Oh yeah, and Gunnar also gets the “majority” of WBD’s $37 billion debt load. That makes Wiedenfels the Mark Lazarus in this Versant copycat situation — if Versant was buried in debt.', '', 'Hollywood couldn’t have scripted it better — for Zaslav. (Ironic considering his unfavorable positioning during the writers guild strike.)', 'Zaslav, a former attorney, started his True Hollywood Story in the late 1980s as president of NBC’s cable, domestic TV and new media distribution divisions. At the time, even he couldn’t see how the latter department would basically cannibalize the former three decades later. At what point that became clear to Zaslav, we’ll never truly know — not through his (ongoing) public comments, at least. At NBC, Zaslav launched MSNBC and oversaw the Olympics on cable — two properties that would inform future interests.', 'In 2006, Zaslav jumped to Discovery and to his first CEO title; two years later, he took the company public. He always liked the stage. The existing Discovery portfolio wasn’t enough for his big ambitions, so Zaslav launched some new networks — like OWN and ID — and bought others (like HGTV and Food Network via an acquisition of Scripps). He got the Olympics back — internationally — in 2015.', '', 'For 15 years, Zaslav was Mr. Cable (being coached all the way by his mentor: “Cable Cowboy” John Malone). Zaslav defended the delivery system and the bundle for as long as he could — and then for a few years longer than that.', 'How synonymous with cable was Zaslav? In 2017, he was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame. Zaslav is a member of the Cable TV Pioneers Class of 2018. Satirically, that was the same year that Zaslav waved the white flag via the launch of Discovery+.', 'Even Zaslav had to say it: streaming was in and cable was out. But there was no way that Discovery+ could compete in the streaming wars, which at the time were all about subscriber growth. A man with mogul ambitions — and a mogul paycheck — wanted more.', 'Also in 2018, AT&T finally closed its wildly dragged out and misguided (and expensive: it was north of $100 billion) acquisition of Time Warner. It took two years for that deal to go through; it only took three years for AT&T to reverse course and sell off the repackaged WarnerMedia, taking a major “L” in the process. Something about all of this sounds so familiar…', 'In 2022, the $43 billion deal that formed Warner Bros. Discovery — with Zaslav at the helm — was finalized. The creation of WBD came with a mountain of debt, but there were perks. Zaslav, an Old Hollywood head, got his legacy movie studio (WB is 102 years old this year) and a bonafide film lot. He got CNN (and his daughter got a job as a congressional producer there), an upgrade from his old left-leaning cable news channel MSNBC. He also inherited the prestige of prestige-TV through HBO, and for a while there it looked like HBO Max/Max/HBO Max-again just might compete with Disney+ and Netflix. Hell, the New York Knicks fan even got the NBA through Turner. Life was good.', '', 'The pay wasn’t so bad either. Zaslav’s 2024 compensation package was valued at nearly $52 million; his 2023 pay was about $50 million. Even in his Discovery-only days Zaslav was among the highest-paid CEOs in media. Patagonia vests aren’t cheap.', 'You know who wasn’t making money? WBD shareholders. The newly formed company’s stock opened April 9, 2022 at $42 per share. Today, shares are teetering around $10.', 'What went wrong? Well, the whole plan, basically.', 'Though direct-to-consumer would become profitable for WBD, it was too little, too late. The film business had its ups and downs. There were the strikes. Cable, the very thing Zaslav is escaping via today’s split-and-spin announcement, has only had downs — for Warner Bros. Discovery that included the loss of the NBA and the subsequent implosion of its sports-centric joint venture (with Disney and Fox) Venu, which was dead before arrival.', 'CNN languished under a short-lived Chris Licht regime; CNN+ made it about a month. Even Zaslav’s PR was a nightmare: he became the name and the face of Hollywood corporate greed by killing off completed and near-completed projects in the name of tax write offs. A certain panic sets in when you have $50 billion in debt to pay down in a struggling marketplace.', 'So Zaslav jumped ship. He will soon be rid of the “Also Ran” that is cable TV — and he’ll be rid of most of WBD’s existing debt as well. If all goes according to plan, Zaslav will have effectively traded in a dying basic-cable bundle for the most influential brand in television and a top-2 or 3 film studio. And he got paid hundreds of millions of dollars to do it.', '', 'The Zaslav Prophecy will be completed in mid-2026.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '', '', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Warner Bros. Discovery to split into two public companies by next year,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/warner-bros-discovery-to-split-into-two-public-companies-by-next-year.html,"['', 'In this article', 'Warner Bros. Discovery\nplans to split into two public companies by next year, the media giant announced Monday, the latest upheaval in the industry as consumers transition from cable to streaming.', 'WBD will separate into a streaming and studios company, which will include its movie properties and streaming service HBO Max, and a global networks company, which will include CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, among other businesses.', 'CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company. Current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will become CEO of the global networks business.', 'Warner Bros. Discovery expects to complete the split by the middle of 2026.', '""By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today\'s evolving media landscape,"" Zaslav said in a release.', 'The news confirms earlier reporting by CNBC and others that WBD was considering such a split. In December, the company announced restructuring that many saw as a precursor to a full break.', 'Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up more than 2% in midday trading Monday.', 'Warner Bros. Discovery joins cable giant Comcast in separating out its traditional pay-TV networks from its broader media business.', 'Comcast\n’s NBCUniversal is currently in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, including CNBC, into a new publicly traded company called Versant. NBCUniversal will continue to oversee streaming service Peacock, NBC’s broadcast network and the film business, among other assets.', 'WBD has the largest portfolio of cable TV networks, which was born from the 2022 merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery, which brought together channels like CNN, TBS and TNT with Discovery, TLC and HGTV.', 'The moves from both Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast come as the industry has been contending with the loss of customers from the traditional pay-TV bundle in favor of streaming.', 'A key focus has been on building up streaming platforms and particularly reaching profitability.', 'Traditional pay-TV’s drag on the broader media business was showcased last year when WBD reported a $9.1 billion write-down on its TV networks business. The company said the move was triggered by a reevaluation of the book value of the TV networks segment.', 'Still, the traditional TV networks remain profitable and generate hefty amounts of cash. Live sports aired on traditional TV still bring in the biggest live audiences, making sports essential to the portfolio of most media companies.', 'Wiedenfels noted on a call with investors Monday that much of the free cash flow generated from the traditional TV business over the years has been used to build up the streaming platform.', 'But while the cash from the traditional business has propped up streaming, the content hasn’t translated for the Max platform, which is being renamed, again, to HBO Max. In May, when the company announced the name change, it also added that the streaming platform would focus more on quality over quantity.', 'During Monday’s call Zaslav said sports hadn’t been “a real driver” for the streaming platform.', 'On Monday’s call, WBD executives emphasized that each company would be “free and clear from a transaction perspective.” While the split is tax-free, executives would be willing to forgo that benefit to do the right deal, according to a person close to the matter who wasn’t authorized to speak about potential M&A publicly.', 'Zaslav has called for deregulation in a push for more consolidation in the media industry, which he has said is going through a period of “generational disruption.”', 'NBCUniversal’s separation of its cable networks is meant to give it further optionality to invest in its business and also merge with other networks, CNBC has previously reported. Versant CEO Mark Lazarus has told CNBC that the spun-out company aims to be acquisitive.', 'The current Warner Bros. Discovery is itself a product of consolidation. Warner Media and Discovery merged in 2022, bringing together Warner Media’s portfolio of HBO, TNT Sports and other TV networks, and the film business, with Discovery’s group of pay-TV networks.', 'Ever since, the company has been working to lighten the debt load stemming from that merger.', 'While the company has repaid $19 billion in debt, it still had just below $34 billion in net debt at the end of the first quarter, Wiedenfels said on Monday’s call.', 'Last month S&P Global Ratings cut WBD’s credit rating to junk status, citing the “continued revenue and cash flow declines” in the traditional TV business.', 'That debt load will be divided among the two separated companies once the split is complete, the company said.', '“It’s safe to assume that the majority of the debt is going to live with global networks and a smaller portion, but not insignificant portion on streaming and studios as well,” said Wiedenfels.', 'Both companies are expected to have strong liquidity, particularly the global networks business, which is projected to generate significant free cash flow that will be used to further repay debt.', 'Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of CNBC. Versant would be the parent company of CNBC under the proposed cable spinout.', '— CNBC’s Jacob Pramuk and Sara Salinas contributed to this report.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

David Zaslav just threw in the towel on his WBD experiment — and Wall Street is thrilled,https://www.businessinsider.com/wbd-spinoff-david-zaslav-wall-street-studios-streaming-tv-networks-2025-6,"['The ill-fated marriage between Warner Bros. and Discovery is heading for divorce — and Wall Street is cheering.', ""Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday announced plans to split its declining TV networks from its growing streaming and studios business. This spinoff proposal comes three years after WBD's inception. If all goes well, the spinoff will happen in mid-2026."", 'WBD CEO David Zaslav will oversee the sexier streaming part, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels — known for delivering ""synergies"" — will be in charge of the shrinking networks. WBD isn\'t alone, as Comcast is also splitting from most of its cable assets.', ""By largely undoing the merger, Zaslav is acknowledging something Wall Street has been saying for a while: WBD's assets are better off apart."", ""WBD shares were up as much as 13% in early trading. (However, Comcast's stock also popped when its spinoff was announced last fall, and has since fallen more than 20%.)"", '""The decision to separate Warner Bros. Discovery reflects our belief that each company can now go further and faster apart than they can together,"" Zaslav said on a call with investors about the spinoff.', 'When asked for comment, a WBD spokesperson referred Business Insider to comments made by executives on the investor call.', ""Many media analysts were initially excited when Zaslav orchestrated the deal to form WBD. But they soon soured on the media conglomerate as cord-cutting accelerated and WBD's streamer — Max/HBO Max — missed lofty expectations and failed to truly challenge the likes of Netflix."", 'Zaslav and company took note. WBD executives telegraphed this spinoff by reorganizing the business late last year, separating the TV networks from its studios and streaming businesses.', ""Wall Street was pleased by this potential split, which was the key catalyst for WBD's stock's 16% rally in the past month, UBS media analyst John Hodulik told BI last week."", 'Others agreed.', '""Investor excitement for a Warner Bros. Discovery spin-off of its Global Linear Networks is building by the day,"" Lightshed analysts led by Rich Greenfield wrote last week.', 'Bank of America\'s Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in an early-June note that a ""spin of studios and streaming could be the best way to unlock the significant unrecognized value of the company.""', ""So far, it seems like she's right."", ""WBD's announcement will likely spark more speculation about future reordering of the media and entertainment landscape."", ""It's long been the expectation among industry insiders that WBD's spun-off linear networks would combine with others, potentially Versant, the linear assets that Comcast is spinning off. Other ideas that have been floated in media circles are a combination with Paramount — assuming its Skydance deal ever gets approved — or with Fox's linear assets."", 'Reordering is also afoot across the advertising industry. Two giant holding companies, Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, are in the process of combining. Their peer WPP is replacing its CEO, Mark Read.', ""One wild card in the mix with WBD is CNN, with President Donald Trump's general hostility to deals involving media companies."", 'Longtime ad industry analyst Brian Wieser remarked that the news network could be an asset and a liability, given its history and future ability to attract the ire of Trump, who has been aggressive in targeting the mainstream media.', 'Wieser wrote on Monday that CNN would ""probably benefit"" from being separated from all of WBD\'s other assets as it\'s ""the one part of WBD that could tie up other parts of this transaction so long as any government approvals are required to facilitate its completion.""', ""Another question is the fate of WBD's studio business, which has been dragged down. On a call Monday announcing the separation, Zaslav emphasized that the movie business was harder to project than TV. But he said that by leaning into well-known IP, he saw WBD's studios arm becoming a $3 billion business."", ""The separation also could put WBD's studios business in play, Bernstein's Lauren Yoon said."", ""The companies that could ingest such a business include Amazon, Disney, Netflix, and Comcast. However, most of the tech companies haven't historically been big acquirers, and the timing isn't ideal."", '""No tech companies want to give the government any reason to be in their business,"" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investments.', ""Also, expect Bob Iger to field new questions about what's ahead for Disney's linear and cable networks. He once floated the idea of selling them, though he then retreated from the idea."", ""Disney's line at the time was that it wouldn't get the price it wanted if it sold those properties and that it'd be too complex to separate them from the rest of the company. Iger and Trump have also sparred in the past, and Disney could look to avoid deals that need government approval."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHRjbFZDTmxOaGMyNDJRa1JWVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
"Warner Bros. Discovery to split into two, separating CNN and cable networks from streaming",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-splits-cnn-hbo-max-streaming-wbd-stock/,"['Watch CBS News', 'Updated on: June 9, 2025 / 12:07 PM EDT / CBS News', 'Warner Bros. Discovery announced the media giant will divide into two new publicly traded companies, with one consisting of its cable networks such as CNN and TNT Sports and the second consisting of its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television. ', 'In a statement on Monday, the company said current Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will serve as president and CEO of Streaming & Studios, while Gunnar Wiedenfels, chief financial officer of Warner Bros. Discovery, will lead the cable division, called Global Networks.', ""The split, which the company said is expected to be completed by mid-2026, effectively unravels much of the merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery in 2022, when WarnerMedia combined with Discovery. Warner Bros. Discovery's cable networks, like many of its rivals, have lost viewers as consumers shifted to streaming services such as Netflix, causing its stock to slump more than 60% since the merger closed more than three years ago.  "", 'Breaking the company into two new media businesses will allow each company to ""pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value,"" Wiedenfels said in the statement. ', 'As part of its announcement, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would focus on scaling up HBO Max, which is now in 77 markets. The company in May said its streaming business — which includes HBO Max — is on track to add 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026. ', ""While Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming business has performed well, Adam Crisafulli of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients that its studio business is struggling. Revenue at that unit fell 18% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year."", ""The company's overall first-quarter revenue tumbled 9% to $9 billion compared with the year-earlier period, according to its most recent earnings report."", ""Last week at their annual meeting, shareholders rejected David Zaslav's $51.9 million pay package, according to Business Insider.  A study by research firm Equilar released in May found the median pay for CEOs in 2024 was $25.6 million, up 9.5% from 2023."", '""The issue with the success of this split is the same one plaguing other media companies (including the separation underway at Comcast and the one considered but ultimately aborted at Disney) – the legacy networks businesses have poor top line growth prospects but relatively healthy profitability/cash flow, which means they generate important liquidity but are likely to garner middling valuations as standalone entities,"" Crisafulli said.', 'New York City-based Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of the company were up 10.7% in early trading. The company has a market value of $24.3 billion.', 'The new plan to separate the businesses comes after Warner Bros. announced a structural reorganization in December. ', 'Legacy media companies have struggled to maintain their foothold in recent years as viewers shift to alternative platforms for news and entertainment. The profit model for these outlets has also proven difficult to sustain as once-steady advertising revenue buckles, leading many companies to consolidate or restructure. ', 'Comcast in November announced plans to spin off some of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company. Dubbed Versant, the new entity will be comprised of USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY and Golf Channel.', 'Elsewhere in the media landscape, Paramount Global, which owns CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon, is going through the merger process. Skydance Media, an entertainment business launched by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, agreed to merge with Paramount Global in July 2024 in an $8 billion deal.', 'Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch.
