I’m leaving Summer House with no regrets (well … maybe one.)”', 'Her statement continued, “I’m proud of the way I handled myself, proud of what I walked away from and even prouder of what I’m walking toward. Big things are coming! Stay tuned!”', 'Lexi made her debut during Summer House season 9 earlier this year, immediately striking up a relationship with fellow cast member Jesse Solomon. While their romance heated up, so did the drama.', '', 'The model became a fan-favorite among Gen Z women as she stood up for herself against Jesse, 31, who made some not-so-cool moves (like getting his toe sucked) during their short-lived romance. (Some Summer House viewers have accused Jesse of love-bombing.)', 'During a recent podcast appearance, Lexi claimed that Jesse misrepresented the nature of their relationship to other members of the cast.', '“From what he was saying, it definitely made the situation and relationship seem really toxic,” she shared on iHeartRadio’s “Chanel in the City” podcast last month. Jesse claimed during the season that Lexi made him “unfollow” girls on social media while they were together.', 'Lexi also detailed her relationship with the Summer House women, alleging that Jesse created “distance and a disconnect” because he would disclose details about their relationship.', '“There was a lot of context that would have made people kind of understand where I was coming from,” Lexi said. “So, I think naturally it just created an isolation for me in the house because it did put our roommates at a weird situation where they were like, ‘OK, well, Lexi’s new, we don’t quite know maybe how to bring this up to her.’”', 'Lexi confronted Jesse during the Summer House season 9 reunion, which came to an end earlier this week. She also brought up Jesse’s “flirty” friendship with fellow Bravo star Ciara Miller.', '“You are also creating this narrative that me and Jesse are more [than friends],” Ciara told Lexi at one point during the reunion. Lexi claimed that Ciara and Jesse skipped out on her birthday party last year to hang out.', '“You illustrated this picture as if we skipped your birthday party intentionally. When, one, I don’t really know when your birthday is and two, the last dinner that we had you’re telling me that you don’t trust me,” Ciara said. “Why would I go to your birthday party? Especially because when you’re illustrating this picture that like me and Jesse are doing things that are manipulative or doing things in the media to rub it in your face — like what the f*** was that?”', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', '', '', 'US WEEKLY HAS AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIPS SO WE MAY RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR SOME LINKS TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', 'Us Weekly is part of Part of the a360media Entertainment Group. © a360media 2025\nPowered by WordPress VIP', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNW9jRlY1VTFsclNpMVpha1pZVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Paige DeSorbo Is Leaving Summer House: ‘It’s Time for This Chapter to Close’,https://www.glamour.com/story/paige-desorbo-is-leaving-summer-house-its-time-for-this-chapter-to-close,"['', 'Paige DeSorbo has an announcement to make: After seven seasons, she’s leaving Summer House.', '“I have a little life update for you: I’ve made the decision not to return to Summer House,” DeSorbo wrote in an Instagram post on June 5. “Being part of this show has been one of the most rewarding chapters of my life—the friendships, the drama, the giggles, all unforgettable. You’ve seen me grow up over these last 7 summers. I’ll always be beyond grateful for the memories, the community, and the opportunities this wild ride has brought me. But like all good things (and some bad decisions), it’s time for this chapter to close.”', 'DeSorbo joined the show in season three, which aired in spring-summer 2019. Since that time, the 32-year-old reality TV star became a fan favorite on the series, graduating from Bravo-lebrity to full-on household name thanks to some key moments on the Bravo series; her viral podcast, Giggly Squad, with former cast member Hannah Berner; and her very public breakup with Craig Conover in 2024.', 'Lately, DeSorbo and Berner’s fame has skyrocketed with a 60-city tour and a New York Times bestseller, How to Giggle. On June 5, DeSorbo even announced her own sleepwear line, Daphne, which is named after her cat.', 'In her Instagram Stories post, DeSorbo promised even more to come. “To my castmates, the fans, and my NBCU family: thank you. I never could’ve imagined what this journey would turn into—and how many of you would be along for the ride,” she wrote. “And you haven’t seen the last of me, I promise. So much more to do together, but for now you know you can always find me and Daphne in my bed.”', 'Though this announcement may come as a shock to fans, Paige DeSorbo teased an “end date” for her reality TV journey in recent interview with Glamour.', '“There’s an end date for me at some point. With the lifestyle of Summer House specifically, I’m probably not fitting into the original show idea anymore,” she said in April. “Whenever I see a comment that’s like, ‘She’s a little too old to be on this,’ I’m like, Yeah, I kind of am. I’m probably not as fun to party with as a 25-year-old, and I get that.”', 'Of the lifestyle, she continued, “I would stay on reality TV, but it’s only fun and real if it’s your lifestyle, and as I get older, I am straying away more and more from partying every weekend. I really can’t drink two nights in a row; I will pass away. I was actually nervous for this season to come out because I felt like I didn’t do anything this summer because I was so tired from working.”', 'Even so, she said, she was “proud” to watch herself this season, even when it was “hard.”', '“Watching it back is definitely hard, because I didn’t realize how emotional I actually was this summer. I see my brain working overtime, and I can tell by how my eyes look that I’m psychoanalyzing every single thing I’m feeling, saying, and doing,” she said. ""I don’t think I would’ve been able to be this vulnerable in this stage of my life had I not been on a reality show for seven years. I’m very proud of myself, because what you see is authentically who I was this summer.”', 'When the 32-year-old Bravo personality split from her longtime boyfriend and spoke openly about anxiety and fertility, she became a figurehead for young women choosing themselves. And—with a successful podcast, a new book, and a top-secret fashion line on the way—it’s paying off.', 'MORE FROM GLAMOUR', 'SEE MORE STORIES & GUIDES', '© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

In the last year alone, she went on a national tour with her Giggly Squad podcast co-host, Berner; dropped a collaboration with DSW; wrote a book; launched her own line of pajamas; and won her breakup with fellow Bravoleb and yard enthusiast Craig Conover. For those of us who watched the 32-year-old muscle her way through cast drama, breakups, hangovers, and bed rot over the better part of a decade, her exit seemed imminent: She was always going to be bigger than a reality show overrun by 40-year-old men.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNW9jRlY1VTFsclNpMVpha1pZVFJEX0FoaXBCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
