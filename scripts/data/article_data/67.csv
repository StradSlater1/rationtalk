There’s now a 50-50 chance this galaxy will crash into ours,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/milky-way-andromeda-galaxy-collision-odds,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Astronomers have long thought that the Milky Way is headed for an inevitable crash with its neighbor, Andromeda. But a new study complicates the story.', 'For more than a century, astronomers have watched the Andromeda galaxy, a massive swirl of neighboring stars, speed toward the Milky Way. And in recent years, measurements using the Hubble Space Telescope seemed to confirm a long-held prophecy: In about four or five billion years’ time, the two galaxies will clash, ultimately merging into a colossal and unrecognizable new galaxy.', 'A fresh survey of both galaxies and—crucially—several of the other weighty galaxies in the same corner of the cosmos has now cast doubt on that calamitous outcome. The new forecast looked billions of years into the future and found that the odds of an Andromeda and Milky Way merger is about fifty-fifty. ', '“A coin flip is the more accurate description,” says Till Sawala, an astrophysicist at the University of Helsinki and a co-author of the new study.', 'A messy galactic apocalypse is no longer a guarantee. As noted in the team’s new study, published today in the journal Nature Astronomy, “proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated.”', 'Earth won’t be around in five billion years’ time; it’ll likely be scorched and swallowed up by our expanding, dying Sun. But if the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies successfully swerve around one another, that’s good news for future worlds. A merger on this scale often sees the supermassive black holes at their hearts of each galaxy unify and expand into a fearsome, hyper-energetic astrophysical monster. That prevents nearby gas cooling down and gathering up to form new stars—and without new stars, you won’t get new planets. ', 'The possibility of a galactic near-miss is “somehow comforting,” says Alister Graham, a galaxy researcher at the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia and who wasn’t involved with the new research. It’s nice to think the Milky Way “still has a long, planet-forming future ahead of it.” ', 'Astronomers witness galaxy mergers happening throughout all of space and time. Two similarly massive galaxies uniting is referred to as a major merger, whereas if a larger galaxy ingests a smaller one, it’s known as a minor merger. ', 'Although some stars get torn apart by the extreme gravitational interactions of the two galaxies churning about—and some, including their planets, will be scattered like confetti in all directions—but the spaces between individual stars are so vast that most of them don’t collide. And although the smaller galaxies can vanish into the maws of the larger ones, the result is often constructive. “Minor mergers deliver both stars and gas—the raw material for future star formation—into the host galaxy. The stellar winds from newly formed stars enrich the interstellar medium with dust and metals, further fueling the star formation cycle,” says Graham. Even the Milky Way shows evidence of having been assembled via multiple galactic smash-ups.', '“Up to 50 percent of the mass in galaxies today come from previous galaxies cannibalized,” says Christopher Conselice, an extragalactic astronomer at the University of Manchester in England and who wasn’t involved with the new research.', 'Though astronomers have known that Andromeda is careening toward the Milky Way since the turn of the 20th Century, they weren’t sure how direct, or glancing, the clash would be. But in 2012, a landmark study using Hubble came to a definitive conclusion: Based on the motions of their stars, and the galaxies’ hefty masses, both would be gravitationally drawn into one another for a head-on collision in four to five billion years. (Later studies have come up with slightly earlier or later timelines for when the merger would happen, but never cast doubt on its inevitability.)', 'And about two billion years after the tempestuous major merger, the two ink-like star spirals would settle down and coalescence. “It would be an elliptical blob,” says Sawala. ', 'Since 2012, this outcome became gospel among the scientific community, and a textbook fact. “Should the Milky Way and Andromeda be all that matter—sorry about the pun—then they would be heading straight at each other,” says Graham.', 'But the possibility of a future smash-up depends on the behavior of everything else in our Local Group, too: the panoply of at least 100 galaxies hanging about in this part of the universe. Other big galaxies in our neck of the woods might push or pull on the two voyagers over time.', 'Sawala’s team decided to simulate the evolution of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies ten billion years into the future. But while doing so, they also accounted for other major players in the Local Group: specifically, the spiral-shaped (and third-largest) Triangulum galaxy  and the Large Magellanic Cloud (or LMC), an irregular galaxy that orbits the Milky Way.', 'The team used data from both Hubble and the European Space Agency’s stargazing Gaia space observatory to more precisely determine the motions of these galaxies, as well as their masses—comprised of both ordinary matter and the invisible, but more prevalent, dark matter. ', 'Although the Triangulum Galaxy was already known to be quite massive, the LMC was thought to be a bit of a lightweight.  But the new data suggest that it’s surprisingly massive—equivalent to 10 to 20 percent of the mass of the Milky Way. “And that will have an effect on how the Milky Way moves through space,” says Sawala. ', 'The team simulated the motions of these four heavyweight galaxies thousands of times. While the Triangulum galaxy’s gravitational influence conspired to bring the Milky Way and Andromeda together, the LMC had a repellent effect. And when all four danced together, the odds of an eventual major merger was just one-in-two.', '“There are going to be uncertainties in how and when the Milky Way and Andromeda would merge,” says Conselice. Dark matter may act as a binding force. But dark energy, a mysterious force that seems to push everything the universe apart, will also play a role—and recent data suggests it’s strength can change over time. That makes forecasting a far-flung galactic merger somewhat tricky. But it’s safe to say that it’s no longer a certainty that these two galaxies will collide.', 'Some astronomers have suggested that if they do, the new galaxy could be named Milkomeda. That moniker doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. Don’t worry, Sawala says: “We will have billions of years to think of a better name.”', 'Either way, galactic pandemonium will shape the Milky Way’s future. Even though the LMC is pushing Andromeda and our own galaxy apart, the team’s simulations also show with that, within the next two billion years, the LMC will spiral into us and be gobbled up by a merciless Milky Way.', '“It’s basically 100 percent that this will happen,” says Sawala. “There’s no escaping that.”', 'Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2025 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The Hubble played a decisive role in the determination during the early 2000s. It was a triumph of precision astronomy and space telescopes. Now, the Hubble has played an equally important role in cancelling the collision.', ""A galaxy collision is a colossal event. The MW and M31 contain as many as 1.5 trillion stars combined. While it's not likely that any individual stars will collide with other individual stars, the collision is still powerful. Gas clouds will collide and compress, triggering abundant star birth and adding billions of new stars. There will be more supernovae, and some stars will likely be ejected from the new, merged galaxy. Since the collision was forecasted to occur billions of years from now, the Sun would be a red giant, Earth would likely be uninhabitable or even destroyed, and humanity would likely be long gone by then."", 'Now it looks like there may be no collision after all, according to new research.

Predicting anything five billion years in the future is a dicey task. However, there was solid evidence in favour of the possibility. However, new evidence from Hubble and Gaia casts serious doubt on the event.', '""Here we consider the latest and most accurate observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, along with recent consensus mass estimates, to derive possible future scenarios and identify the main sources of uncertainty in the evolution of the Local Group over the next 10 billion years,"" the authors write.', 'At issue is the nature of the Local Group of galaxies. The MW and M31 dominate the Local Group, but it has other members, too. The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is the other large galaxy in the Local Group, and there are also satellite galaxies of all three large galaxies, like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).', 'Prior to colliding, the MW and M31 will orbit one another. This orbit is unstable and is the source of much of the uncertainty around the merger. ""We found that the next most massive Local Group member galaxies—namely, M33 and the Large Magellanic Cloud—distinctly and radically affect the Milky Way-Andromeda orbit,"" the authors write in their research article.', '""We have the most comprehensive study of this problem today that actually folds in all the observational uncertainties,"" said lead author Sawala in a press release.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.', 'A collision between our Milky Way galaxy and its largest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, predicted to occur in about 4.5 billion years, has been anticipated by astronomers since 1912. But new research suggests that the likelihood of this galactic clash, dubbed “Milkomeda,” is smaller than it seems.', 'At first glance, it appears likely that the galactic duo — separated by about 2.5 million light-years — is on an inevitable collision course. The Milky Way and Andromeda are barreling toward each other at about 223,694 miles per hour (100 kilometers per second).', 'However, the Local Group, or our corner of the universe, includes 100 known smaller galaxies. A team of astronomers factored in some of the largest among them, including the Large Magellanic Cloud, or LMC, and M33, or the Triangulum galaxy, to see how much of a role they might play on the chessboard of our galaxy’s future over the next 10 billion years.', 'After factoring in the gravitational pull of Local Group galaxies and running 100,000 simulations using new data from the Hubble and Gaia space telescopes, the team found there is about a 50% chance of a collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda in the next 10 billion years. There is only about a 2% chance the galaxies will collide in 4 to 5 billion years as previously thought, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.', 'A merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies would destroy them both, eventually turning both spiral structures into one elongated galaxy, the study authors said. Collisions between other galaxies have been known to create “cosmic fireworks, when gas, driven to the center of the merger remnant, feeds a central black hole emitting an enormous amount of radiation, before irrevocably falling into the hole,” said study coauthor Carlos Frenk, professor at Durham University in England.', '“Until now we thought this was the fate that awaited our Milky Way galaxy,” Frenk said. “We now know that there is a very good chance that we may avoid that scary destiny.”', 'However, there are many unknown factors that make it difficult to predict the ultimate fate of our galaxy, according to the study authors. And, Frenk warns, the Milky Way has a greater chance of colliding with the LMC within 2 billion years, which could fundamentally alter our galaxy.', 'The LMC orbits the Milky Way, while M33 is a satellite of Andromeda.', 'The LMC’s mass is only about 15% of the Milky Way’s. But the team found that the satellite galaxy has a gravitational pull, perpendicular to Andromeda, that changes the Milky Way’s motion enough to reduce the chance of a merger between the two giant galaxies. It’s a similar case for M33.', '“The extra mass of Andromeda’s satellite galaxy M33 pulls the Milky Way a little bit more towards it,” said lead study author Dr. Till Sawala, astronomer at the University of Helsinki in Finland. “However, we also show that the LMC pulls the Milky Way off the orbital plane and away from Andromeda. It doesn’t mean that the LMC will save us from that merger, but it makes it a bit less likely.”', 'Previous research also has assumed most likely values for unknown data, such as the uncertainties in the present positions, motions and masses of the Local Group galaxies. In the new study, the team accounted for 22 different variables, including those unknowns, that could contribute to a collision.', '“We ran many thousands of simulations, which allowed us to account for all the observational uncertainties,” Sawala said. “Because there are so many variables that each have their errors, that accumulates to rather large uncertainty about the outcome, leading to the conclusion that the chance of a direct collision is only 50% within the next 10 billion years.”', 'In just over half of the simulations predicting what could occur in 8 to 10 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies initially sailed somewhat closely past each other before circling back and then losing enough orbital energy to collide and merge as one galaxy. These initial close encounters between each galaxy’s halo — a large envelope of gas — would eventually lead to a collision.', '“In general, the merger would most likely involve a strong starburst, during which many new stars would form, followed by a period of intense radiation caused by exploding young stars and the newly active supermassive black hole, eventually shutting down star formation completely,” Sawala said. “A few billion years later, any traces of the former Milky Way and Andromeda would disappear, and the remnant would be a largely featureless elliptical galaxy.”', 'In the other simulations, both galaxies crossed paths without disturbing each other.', 'Geraint Lewis, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Astronomy, finds the results showing the gravitational influence of M33 and the LMC interesting. He has previously authored research on a potential collision between Andromeda and the Milky Way.', '“We won’t know if the collision is definitely off in the future, but this clearly shows that the story that people tell — that there will be a collision that will destroy the Milky Way and Andromeda — is not as clear or certain that people think,” Lewis said. “But even if there is a pretty close encounter rather than smashing head-on, the gravitational tearing that each will assert on each other is likely to leave the two large galaxies in a sorry state.”', 'While including the LMC’s gravitational effects on the Milky Way is important, accounting for uncertainties is the most important aspect of the new study, said Scott Lucchini, a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian.', '“Here, they’ve sampled from the uncertainties in the positions, velocities, and masses of the galaxies to obtain the relative probabilities of different outcomes,” Lucchini wrote in an email. “This really gives us the whole picture of what could happen in the future.”', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nMysterious radio pulses from the Milky Way ‘are unlike anything we knew before’', 'Galaxies are full of intricacies. Their shapes can become distorted, interactions can change their orbits and they can lose mass in different ways. Such complexities make predictions difficult, Lucchini said.', 'That essentially leaves the fate of the Milky Way “completely open,” the study authors wrote in the new paper.', 'However, more data coming from the Gaia space telescope in the summer of 2026 will provide measurements that refine some of the uncertainties about the speed and direction at which Andromeda is moving across the sky, Sawala said.', 'The fate of the sun may have a bigger impact on Earth’s future than the motions of galaxies, according to the researchers.', 'Our sun is 4.5 billion years old. When it starts to die in another 5 billion years, it will swell into a red giant that engulfs Mercury, Venus and potentially Earth, according to NASA.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nAstronomers spot flares of light near the black hole at the center of our galaxy', '“The short answer is that the end of the sun is far worse for our planet than the collision with Andromeda,” Sawala said. “While that merger would mean the end of our galaxy, it would not necessarily be the end of the sun or the Earth. Although our work also shows that earlier studies, that purported to predict precisely what the fate of the solar system would be after the merger, were clearly premature, in general, collisions between stars or planets are extremely rare during galaxy mergers. And while the end of the sun is certain, our study shows that the end of the galaxy is anything but.”', 'While the team didn’t model a merger between the LMC and the Milky Way in detail, they found a “virtual certainty” that a merger between the two galaxies will occur within the next 2 billion years, which aligns with previous research, Sawala said. But the effects will likely be more minor than a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda.', '“The merger (between the Milky Way and the LMC) will not destroy our galaxy but it will change it profoundly, particularly impacting our central supermassive black hole and the galactic halo,” Frenck wrote in an email.

Galaxies in space often merge, infusing areas with hot gas and dust needed to fuel new star formation. But while the intense gravity in a merger would rip some stars apart and throw many solar systems into disarray, most stars would be unscathed due to the vast distances between them, writes National Geographic’s Robin George Andrews. They would just recombine into a different, massive galaxy.', 'If the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies did collide, the merger would be strong enough to throw the sun into a new region in space, wrote NASA in 2012, when astronomers predicted this crash was a near-certainty.', 'Drawing upon observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, the team ran thousands of simulations of different scenarios over the next ten billion years. This time, they accounted for other celestial objects, factoring in updated estimates on the masses of nearby galaxies that could influence the odds of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda.', '“A head-on collision is very unlikely; we found a less than 2 percent chance for that. In most of the cases that lead to a merger, the two galaxies will indeed fly past each other at first, which will lead to a loss of orbital energy and subsequently to a merger,” Sawala tells Space.com’s Robert Lea. “How close they come on their first passage is very uncertain, however, and if they don’t come very close, meaning if their distance is more than around 500,000 light-years, they might not merge at all.”', 'Exactly which of these scenarios ultimately occurs could be governed by the masses of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Triangulum galaxy, two galactic players in the Local Group. In the team’s simulations, the spiral-shaped Triangulum galaxy’s gravity increased the chance of a collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the LMC decreased the chance of a clash, reports Marica Dunn for the Associated Press.', 'In the simulation where all four objects—the LMC, Triangulum, the Milky Way and Andromeda—were included, the odds of an eventual merger were predicted at 50 percent.', 'Dark matter and dark energy might also influence how these galactic giants interact, but those effects aren’t well understood, per National Geographic.

A century later, researchers used NASA’s Hubble telescope to measure Andromeda’s movement across the sky, leading them to report in 2012 that it was bound for a direct strike with the Milky Way, and subsequent studies confirmed the convergence. “The idea of the collision has been accepted for a long time,” D’Onghia says.', 'But those earlier studies had not fully considered the influences of the Large Magellanic Cloud, says astrophysicist Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki in Finland. It’s the fourth largest galaxy in the Local Group, a gravitationally bound neighborhood of galaxies that’s dominated by the Milky Way and Andromeda. The Large Magellanic Cloud may have been left out because the data available at the time led researchers to believe it was relatively insignificant, Sawala says. But over the last decade, observations have revealed that the galaxy is more massive than had previously been proposed.', 'Curious as to how the latest and most accurate data from Hubble and the European Space Agency’s Gaia telescope might shift the odds of a galactic smashup, Sawala and colleagues simulated the movements of the Milky Way, Andromeda, the Large Magellanic Cloud and Messier 33 — the Local Group’s third largest galaxy — over 10 billion years. The team performed roughly 100,000 simulation runs to test every possibility across the full range of uncertainty in the data.', 'With the new data, simulations of just the Milky Way and Andromeda produced collisions a little less than half the time, they found, and adding in Messier 33 increased the collision odds to about 66 percent. But when the team incorporated the Large Magellanic Cloud, the odds dropped to just over 50 percent.\n\nThe gravity of the Large Magellanic Cloud appears to introduce some sideways momentum to the Milky Way’s path, tugging it out of Andromeda’s way in roughly half of the simulation runs, Sawala says. But the save may be a thankless one, as the results suggest the Milky Way is certain to collide with and engulf the much smaller Large Magellanic Cloud in about 2 billion years.', 'The results “show that the situation is more uncertain than previously thought,” says D’Onghia, who was not involved in the work.', 'But not all agree that the odds are so even. While it’s good that the study considers these other galaxies, “I can’t see how they would actually change the course of the merger,” says astrophysicist Sangmo Tony Sohn of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, coauthor of the 2012 study that predicted the head-on convergence. Based on his and his colleagues’ interpretation of the data, they believe the combined mass of the Milky Way and Andromeda is greater than what’s assumed in the new paper, which would make them more prone to coalesce. “I’m someone still who actually believes that there’s a higher chance of the two galaxies merging,” he says.', 'Consensus may be reached in the next decade, both Sawala and Sohn say, as better instruments and methodologies and more observations become available. Part of that will involve refining estimates of how much dark matter each galaxy possesses, as the invisible substance is thought to dominate their masses.', 'If the collision does ever occur, it may not matter much to Earth. The sun is expected to swallow up the inner planets and collapse into a white dwarf in about 8 billion years, so “there’s a fairly good probability that even if that merger happens, it will happen after the solar system doesn’t exist anymore,” Sawala says.', 'Sponsor Message', '“It has no relevance for my own life or the life of my children,” he says.

This collision would eventually obliterate both galaxies and form a massive elliptical galaxy.', 'However, a new study suggests this catastrophic fate may not be as certain as once thought.', 'A team of scientists led by Durham University used data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Gaia Observatory to simulate the dynamic future of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.', 'The results revise our understanding of galactic evolution, suggesting that the merger may happen much later than previously estimated – and, in fact, may not happen at all.', 'The new study challenges a long-held assumption: that the Milky Way and Andromeda, traveling toward each other at about 100 kilometers per second, were destined to collide in about five billion years.', 'Instead, after running 100,000 simulations based on updated observations, the team found there is only a 2% chance of a collision within that timeframe.', 'In just over half of the simulations, the galaxies experienced at least one close encounter. However, astronomers now project a complete merger to occur in eight to ten billion years.', 'In many other scenarios, the galaxies merely passed each other at great distances and continued on their paths, relatively undisturbed. Moreover, by then, the Sun will have burned out, making any merger irrelevant to life on Earth.', 'A key factor in the updated forecast is the inclusion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.', 'For the first time, researchers factored in its gravitational influence in a statistically meaningful way. Till Sawala is the study’s lead author and an astrophysicist at the University of Helsinki.', '“Although its mass is only around 15% of the Milky Way’s, its gravitational pull directed perpendicular to the orbit with Andromeda perturbs the Milky Way’s motion enough to significantly reduce the chance of a merger with the Andromeda Galaxy,” said Sawala.', 'In previous models, researchers often relied on single “best guess” values for key variables.

There's a 50/50 Chance the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy Will Merge,https://www.extremetech.com/science/theres-a-5050-chance-the-milky-way-and-andromeda-galaxy-will-merge,"[""The universe might not meet its end for another quinvigintillion years, but our galaxy's fate teeters on a far less certain line. New research shows that there's a 50% chance that the Milky Way and its nearest major galactic neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, will converge within the next 10 billion years. Previous analyses have made out the convergence to be a sure-fire thing, but it turns out that one dwarf galaxy is recalibrating the scales."", ""Though about 2.5 million light-years currently lie between the Milky Way and Andromeda, the two galaxies are creeping closer to each other. In 1913, astronomer Vesto Melvin Slipher noticed via Arizona's Lowell Observatory that Andromeda (then known as the Andromeda Nebula) was approaching the Milky Way at 186 miles per second. Since then, researchers have not only verified Slipher's math but also found via multiple simulations that Andromeda will someday combine with the Milky Way. One paper from 2021 even proposes that the two galaxies will meet 4.3 billion years from now, with a complete merger taking another 6 billion years after that."", 'But these simulations failed to account for one small yet mighty factor: the Large Magellanic Cloud. Roughly 160,000 light-years from our Milky Way, this dwarf galaxy has long been considered an insignificant part of the so-called Local Group. But in 2015, the beginning of the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History, or SMASH, found that the Large Magellanic Cloud was larger and more complex than initially thought. Astronomers have spent the years since sifting through SMASH data for dwarf galaxy secrets. ', ""It's for this reason that the latest Milky Way-Andromeda merger simulation actually includes the Large Magellanic Cloud. To cover for every possible uncertainty, an international team of astronomers ran their simulation nearly 100,000 times and found that just under 50% of the time, the Milky Way and Andromeda collided and merged. Alternately dropping different nearby galaxies showed that Messier 33 (the third largest galaxy in the Local Group) made a merger more likely, while the Large Magellanic Cloud reduced the odds of a convergence. That's because the Large Magellanic Cloud pulls the Milky Way out of Andromeda's path, as a comic book hero would pull a civilian off some train tracks.  "", ""The Large Magellanic Cloud might only get to bask in its glory for a few hundred million years, however. The researchers' simulation showed that the Milky Way will almost certainly collide with the Large Magellanic Cloud in 2 billion years, disappearing the latter galaxy."", ""As observatories gather more data about the universe—and scientists' models inevitably become more advanced—we'll find out whether the Large Magellanic Cloud really will swoop in to save the day. Of course, we won't see the benefit either way. But it will be nice to know whether our galactic home will continue to exist after we're gone."", '© 2001-2025 ZIFF DAVIS, LLC., A ZIFF DAVIS COMPANY.

A team of astronomers factored in some of the largest among them, including the Large Magellanic Cloud, or LMC, and M33, or the Triangulum galaxy, to see how much of a role they might play on the chessboard of our galaxy’s future over the next 10 billion years.', 'After factoring in the gravitational pull of Local Group galaxies and running 100,000 simulations using new data from the Hubble and Gaia space telescopes, the team found there is about a 50% chance of a collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda in the next 10 billion years. There is only about a 2% chance the galaxies will collide in 4 to 5 billion years as previously thought, according to the study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.', 'A merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies would destroy them both, eventually turning both spiral structures into one elongated galaxy, the study authors said. Collisions between other galaxies have been known to create “cosmic fireworks, when gas, driven to the center of the merger remnant, feeds a central black hole emitting an enormous amount of radiation, before irrevocably falling into the hole,” said study coauthor Carlos Frenk, professor at Durham University in England.', '“Until now we thought this was the fate that awaited our Milky Way galaxy,” Frenk said. “We now know that there is a very good chance that we may avoid that scary destiny.”', 'However, there are many unknown factors that make it difficult to predict the ultimate fate of our galaxy, according to the study authors. And, Frenk warns, the Milky Way has a greater chance of colliding with the LMC within 2 billion years, which could fundamentally alter our galaxy.', 'The LMC orbits the Milky Way, while M33 is a satellite of Andromeda.', 'The LMC’s mass is only about 15% of the Milky Way’s. But the team found that the satellite galaxy has a gravitational pull, perpendicular to Andromeda, that changes the Milky Way’s motion enough to reduce the chance of a merger between the two giant galaxies. It’s a similar case for M33.', '“The extra mass of Andromeda’s satellite galaxy M33 pulls the Milky Way a little bit more towards it,” said lead study author Dr. Till Sawala, astronomer at the University of Helsinki in Finland. “However, we also show that the LMC pulls the Milky Way off the orbital plane and away from Andromeda. It doesn’t mean that the LMC will save us from that merger, but it makes it a bit less likely.”', 'Previous research also has assumed most likely values for unknown data, such as the uncertainties in the present positions, motions and masses of the Local Group galaxies. In the new study, the team accounted for 22 different variables, including those unknowns, that could contribute to a collision.', '“We ran many thousands of simulations, which allowed us to account for all the observational uncertainties,” Sawala said. “Because there are so many variables that each have their errors, that accumulates to rather large uncertainty about the outcome, leading to the conclusion that the chance of a direct collision is only 50% within the next 10 billion years.”', 'In just over half of the simulations predicting what could occur in 8 to 10 billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies initially sailed somewhat closely past each other before circling back and then losing enough orbital energy to collide and merge as one galaxy. These initial close encounters between each galaxy’s halo — a large envelope of gas — would eventually lead to a collision.', '“In general, the merger would most likely involve a strong starburst, during which many new stars would form, followed by a period of intense radiation caused by exploding young stars and the newly active supermassive black hole, eventually shutting down star formation completely,” Sawala said. “A few billion years later, any traces of the former Milky Way and Andromeda would disappear, and the remnant would be a largely featureless elliptical galaxy.”', 'In the other simulations, both galaxies crossed paths without disturbing each other.', 'Geraint Lewis, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Astronomy, finds the results showing the gravitational influence of M33 and the LMC interesting. He has previously authored research on a potential collision between Andromeda and the Milky Way.', '“We won’t know if the collision is definitely off in the future, but this clearly shows that the story that people tell — that there will be a collision that will destroy the Milky Way and Andromeda — is not as clear or certain that people think,” Lewis said. “But even if there is a pretty close encounter rather than smashing head-on, the gravitational tearing that each will assert on each other is likely to leave the two large galaxies in a sorry state.”', 'While including the LMC’s gravitational effects on the Milky Way is important, accounting for uncertainties is the most important aspect of the new study, said Scott Lucchini, a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian.', '“Here, they’ve sampled from the uncertainties in the positions, velocities, and masses of the galaxies to obtain the relative probabilities of different outcomes,” Lucchini wrote in an email. “This really gives us the whole picture of what could happen in the future.”', 'Galaxies are full of intricacies. Their shapes can become distorted, interactions can change their orbits and they can lose mass in different ways. Such complexities make predictions difficult, Lucchini said.', 'That essentially leaves the fate of the Milky Way “completely open,” the study authors wrote in the new paper.', 'However, more data coming from the Gaia space telescope in the summer of 2026 will provide measurements that refine some of the uncertainties about the speed and direction at which Andromeda is moving across the sky, Sawala said.', 'The fate of the sun may have a bigger impact on Earth’s future than the motions of galaxies, according to the researchers.', 'Our sun is 4.5 billion years old. When it starts to die in another 5 billion years, it will swell into a red giant that engulfs Mercury, Venus and potentially Earth, according to NASA.', '“The short answer is that the end of the sun is far worse for our planet than the collision with Andromeda,” Sawala said. “While that merger would mean the end of our galaxy, it would not necessarily be the end of the sun or the Earth. Although our work also shows that earlier studies, that purported to predict precisely what the fate of the solar system would be after the merger, were clearly premature, in general, collisions between stars or planets are extremely rare during galaxy mergers. And while the end of the sun is certain, our study shows that the end of the galaxy is anything but.”', 'While the team didn’t model a merger between the LMC and the Milky Way in detail, they found a “virtual certainty” that a merger between the two galaxies will occur within the next 2 billion years, which aligns with previous research, Sawala said. But the effects will likely be more minor than a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda.', '“The merger (between the Milky Way and the LMC) will not destroy our galaxy but it will change it profoundly, particularly impacting our central supermassive black hole and the galactic halo,” Frenck wrote in an email.

As a result of their merger, predicted in around 5 billion years, the two large spiral galaxies that define the present Local Group would form a new elliptical galaxy. Here we consider the latest and most accurate observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, along with recent consensus mass estimates, to derive possible future scenarios and identify the main sources of uncertainty in the evolution of the Local Group over the next 10 billion years. We found that the next most massive Local Group member galaxies—namely, M33 and the Large Magellanic Cloud—distinctly and radically affect the Milky Way–Andromeda orbit. Although including M33 increases the merger probability, the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud runs perpendicular to the Milky Way–Andromeda orbit and makes their merger less probable. In the full system, we found that uncertainties in the present positions, motions and masses of all galaxies leave room for drastically different outcomes and a probability of close to 50% that there will be no Milky Way–Andromeda merger during the next 10 billion years. Based on the best available data, the fate of our Galaxy is still completely open.', 'The Local Group (LG) contains two large spiral galaxies, our own Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31), along with approximately 100 known smaller galaxies1. In addition, it probably hosts other galaxies yet to be discovered2, and, according to the standard cosmological model, a vast number of completely dark substructures3. The negative radial velocity of M31 towards the MW has been known for over a century4, even before its distance was first accurately measured5. However, although indirect methods have since been used to constrain the transverse components of M31’s velocity vector6,7,8, direct measurements of the minute proper motions have been achieved only much more recently with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)9. The first numerical studies10 of a possible MW-M31 merger predate even the early estimates of the transverse velocity. The finding that the MW-M31 motion is close to radial immediately led to the prediction of a probable future collision and merger11,12,13. This scenario has since become the prevalent narrative14,15 and textbook knowledge16,17.', 'The MW and M31 both contain remnants of past mergers and interactions with other galaxies18,19,20,21. Predicting future mergers requires knowledge about the present coordinates, velocities and masses of the systems partaking in the interaction. In addition to the gravitational force between galaxies, dynamical friction is the dominant process in the lead-up to galactic mergers, as it transfers orbital kinetic energy to internal energy of the objects involved and, consequently, leads to the decay of galactic orbits.', 'In this study, we parameterized the density profile of each halo as a spherical Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile22 with an isotropic velocity distribution, and we used standard assumptions about their concentrations, c, and velocity dispersion profiles23. We calculated the dynamical friction using an analytic formalism (see Methods for a detailed description). Although non-gravitational processes (such as gas drag and star formation leading to increased central densities and so on) also shape the final stages of a merger, the phase of the orbit that defines the occurrence of mergers is largely determined by gravity, which in turn, is dominated by the dark matter component in the standard cosmological model24.', 'The simplest model for the MW-M31 orbit, as considered by ref. 11, contains only the two main galaxies. Because of the planar symmetry, only five parameters are required: the two masses, their initial separation and the two velocity components. In general, an orbit with N\u2009>\u20092 galaxies requires 3(N\u2009−\u20091) coordinates and 3(N\u2009−\u20091) velocity components, along with the N masses. More recently, refs. 12,13 considered three-body orbits by including M33, the third most massive LG galaxy. Reference 13 also considered the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the fourth most massive LG galaxy. They still concluded that a merger is certain. Here, we consider two-body, three-body and four-body systems to study the future evolution of the LG and reveal the distinct effects of the M33 and LMC on the MW-M31 orbit.', 'In the context of the LG, it is important to note that apart from the sky positions, all parameters, including distance moduli, line-of-sight velocities, proper motions, masses and concentrations, carry non-negligible uncertainties. We used Monte Carlo sampling of all values to investigate how these observational errors propagate to uncertainties on the future evolution and, in particular, the probability of a merger between the MW and M31.', 'Our fiducial LG model contains the four most massive LG members: the MW, M31, M33 and the LMC, based on the latest and most accurate available data. We express all masses in terms of M200, the mass enclosed within a sphere whose mean density is 200 × the critical density. The mass of the MW has recently been extensively studied using Gaia data, with a consensus emerging of a total mass close to 1012\u2009M⊙. We adopted M200\u2009=\u20091\u2009±\u20090.2\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙ (excluding the mass of the LMC, which we treated separately). For all other galaxies, there is considerably more uncertainty. For M31, we adopted M200\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009±\u20090.4\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙.

See Methods for a review of mass estimates.', 'The line-of-sight velocities (vlos) are known well, and we adopted the values given by ref. 1. For the distance moduli μ, we chose the most accurate and precise recent values in the literature: from ref. 25 for the LMC and from ref. 26 for M33. We used for M31 recent HST cepheid results27.', 'We use the notation μδ for the proper motion in declination (dec.) and μα*\u2009=\u2009μα\u2009cos\u2009δ for the proper motion in right ascension (RA). We used the HST proper motions of ref. 28 for the LMC and the combined HST and Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) proper motions of ref. 13 for M33. Our fiducial M31 proper motions are the most precise values in the literature based on Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) astrometry29. However, we found very similar results using the combined Gaia DR2 and HST proper motions of ref. 13, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. All assumed values are listed in Table 1.

This truncation increased the probability of a MW-M31 merger by only ~10% (Extended Data Fig. 2). For the fiducial model, we use 50,000 Monte Carlo samples, whereas for all other variants, we used 2,500 samples to ensure that all statistical errors on the merger rate were below 1%.', 'The Monte Carlo initial conditions were integrated numerically using a symplectic direct scheme (see Methods for details). Figure 1 shows 100 realizations each of the MW-M31 orbit in the two-body MW-M31 and the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC systems.

White lines show the individual orbits using the most probable values of every variable, either assuming the Gaia DR3 proper motions29 of the fiducial model (solid) or HST\u2009+\u2009Gaia DR2 proper motions13 (dashed). ML, fiducial model.', 'The MW-M31 two-body orbit evolves in a plane and leads to a merger in slightly less than half of cases, most of which occur during the second pericentre. The addition of M33 increases the merger probability to ~2/3, with a similar median merger time. However, the addition of the LMC has the opposite effect: the pure MW-M31-LMC system experiences a merger in only slightly more than 1/3 of cases and the merger probability of the full M31-MW-M33-LMC system is just over 50%.', 'For each system, we also show the single orbit obtained by adopting the most probable value of each observable, either in the fiducial model or assuming HST\u2009+\u2009Gaia DR2 proper motions for M31 (ref. 13). For the MW-M31-M33 system, which is the one considered by refs. 12,13, and using the same parameter values as considered in ref. 13, corresponding to the solid white line in the bottom left panel of Fig. 2, we reproduced a very similar time for the first pericentre, ~4.5\u2009Gyr, and a similar first pericentre distance, ~100\u2009kpc, as reported by ref. 13.', 'However, despite using newer and even more precise measurements, when we performed a Monte Carlo analysis, we found considerable uncertainty in the outcome that was not previously reported. In particular, in the full MW-M31-M33-LMC system, a merger between the MW and M31 occurs within the next 10\u2009Gyr in only approximately half of the cases. This is in stark contrast to all previous results, which considered only the most probable values without accounting for the numerous and significant uncertainties.', 'Figure 3 shows the probability distributions of the merger time and of the minimum distance between the MW and M31, as well as the ‘survival’ rate of the MW over time, which is the probability that no merger with M31 occurs. In the fiducial model, we consider that a merger has occurred when the distance between any two galaxies is below 20\u2009kpc, but our results are not sensitive to this particular choice (see Methods for details). Because of the effect of dynamical friction, we found that there are two distinct possibilities for the eventual fate of the MW and M31: (1) Orbits that come within less than ~200\u2009kpc eventually merge, which would probably lead to the formation of an intermediate-mass elliptical galaxy10,33,34. For systems that merge, we found a median time of 7.6\u2009Gyr in the fiducial model, or 8.0\u2009Gyr adopting a 10-kpc threshold. (2) Orbits with larger pericentres do not decay due to dynamical friction. In this case, the MW and M31 continue to evolve in isolation. Based on the best current data, both outcomes are almost equally probable.', 'Blue and red colours show results using a distance threshold (dm) of 20\u2009kpc (our default) or 10\u2009kpc for a merger, respectively. Mergers happen, on average, later when the distance threshold is lower, but the fraction of systems that merge within 10\u2009Gyr is similar. The median time to merger is 7.6\u2009Gyr for systems that merge with a 20-kpc threshold and 8.0\u2009Gyr for systems that merge with a 10-kpc threshold. The distributions of minimum distance show a clear bimodality, independently of the threshold. About half of the systems reach the merger threshold within 10\u2009Gyr, whereas the vast majority of the remaining systems do not approach closer than 200\u2009kpc. The survival rate of the MW drops sharply between ~6 and 9\u2009Gyr and levels off afterwards.', 'The distinct effects of each satellite on the MW-M31 orbit are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, which compare the trajectories of the MW and M31 in two-body systems and in systems that also include either M33 or the LMC. Both satellites provide some extra acceleration in the radial direction of the MW-M31 orbit. However, importantly, both satellites also affect the motion of their respective hosts. Including M33 in the calculation decreases the transverse velocity of M31 with respect to the MW. By contrast, as already pointed out in ref. 35, at its current orbital phase, the recoil due to the LMC results in a lower transverse velocity measured between the MW and M31. During its short orbital period of ~1.5\u2009Gyr, the LMC will accelerate the MW to a higher transverse velocity. In addition, the inclusion of M33 largely provides momentum in the original MW-M31 plane, whereas the inclusion of the LMC also provides important momentum perpendicular to the MW-M31 plane. In our analysis, the LMC is certain to merge with the MW, and M33 is highly probable (~86%) to merge with M31 before any possible MW-M31 merger. The net effect of adding M33 to the two-body system is to increase the merger probability, whereas the net effect of adding the LMC is to decrease it.', 'As in Figs. 1 and 5, panels in the top row are projected in the orbital plane defined by the initial MW and M31 positions and velocities, whereas those in the bottom row are projected perpendicular to this orbital plane. Arrows point towards the initial position of M31. On the left, we compare MW trajectories in the two-body MW-M31 system to those in the three-body MW-M31-M33 system. In the centre and right, we show the orbit of the LMC and that of the MW before (centre) and after (right) the merger with the LMC in the MW-M31-LMC system. Compared to the two-body orbit, the inclusion of M33 reduces the transverse velocity of the MW relative to M31 and introduces only a small velocity perpendicular to the MW-M31 orbital plane. By contrast, the LMC increases the MW-M31 transverse velocity and causes a larger velocity perpendicular to the MW-M31 orbital plane.', 'As in Figs. 1 and 4, panels in the top row are projected in the orbital plane defined by the initial MW and M31 positions and velocities, whereas those in the bottom row are projected perpendicular to this orbital plane. Arrows point towards the initial position of the MW. On the right, we compare M31 trajectories in the two-body MW-M31 system to those in the three-body MW-M31-LMC system. In the centre and on the left, we show the orbit of M33 and that of M31 before and after a possible merger with M33 in the MW-M31-M33 system. Compared to the two-body orbit, the inclusion of the LMC increases the transverse velocity of M31 and introduces motion perpendicular to the initial orbital plane. On the other hand, the inclusion of M33 results in very little motion perpendicular to the plane of the two-body orbit and reduces the transverse velocity of M33 with respect to the MW.', 'Figure 6 shows how the merger probability depends on the different observables. In each panel, we show the dependence on two variables in the ±2σ ranges, with the remaining variables Monte Carlo sampled. The effects of the concentration parameters are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. We found that all masses, the proper motions of M31 and M33, and the distance moduli of M31 and M33 significantly impact the probability of a merger. The merger probability is positively correlated with the masses of the MW, M31 and M33 and negatively correlated with the mass of the LMC. The impact of the satellite masses is more pronounced for lower combined masses of the MW and M31. The ±2σ ranges of the M31 proper motions include values that imply a merger probability above 90% but also values that imply a merger probability close to zero. The most probable proper motions (assuming no errors) lead to a merger in only ~2/3 of cases.', 'In each panel, we show the probability of a MW-M31 merger within 10\u2009Gyr as a function of two variables, with all other observables sampling the probability distributions of the fiducial model. White lines on the colour bars indicate the minimum and maximum merger probabilities for the range of values shown in each panel, which indicates the sensitivity of the merger probability on the two corresponding variables. Top row, dependence on different masses. Second row, dependence on proper motions. Third row, dependence on distance moduli and line-of-sight velocities. The axes extend to ±2σ of the fiducial model. The merger probability is positively correlated with the mass of the MW, M31 and M33 and negatively correlated with the mass of the LMC. The merger probability most strongly depends on μδ(M31) and μα*(M31) but also varies significantly with μδ(M33) and μα*(M33). The uncertainties in the distance moduli for M31 and M33 contribute to the uncertainty of the outcome, whereas the effect of the line-of-sight velocities is small.', 'Future, more precise, proper motion measurements may significantly change the expected outcome: they could make the merger either more or less probable. However, if they fall within ±1σ of the currently most probable values, even precise M31 proper motion measurements alone will not suffice to determine the outcome. Even the comparatively high precision of the line-of-sight velocity and distance moduli for M33 and M31 contribute substantial uncertainty, with the probability of a merger varying between 40% and over 60% for different combinations in the ±2σ ranges around the most probable values.', 'Given the considerable measurement errors, note that cosmological simulations result in a present-day MW-M31 transverse velocity prior of \\({v}_\\mathrm{t}=7{5}_{-40}^{+65}\\)\u2009km\u2009s−1 (ref. 36), which is compatible with recent measurements13,29 but not with a perfectly radial orbit12. There is, thus, no reason to assume that the transverse velocity measured using Gaia DR3 (most probable value vt\u2009=\u200976\u2009km\u2009s−1) is overestimated or to expect that more precise measurements will result in a lower value. Also note that, as shown in Fig. 6, a perfectly radial present-day M31-MW motion (vt\u2009=\u20090, μα*\u2009=\u200938.03\u2009mas\u2009yr−1 and μδ\u2009=\u2009−21.37\u2009mas\u2009yr−1) does not result in the highest merger probability in the four-body system.', 'Even using the latest and most precise available observational data, the future evolution of the LG is uncertain. Intriguingly, we found an almost equal probability for the widely publicized merger scenario (albeit with a later median time to merger) and one where the MW and M31 survive unscathed. We reached this conclusion by including the LMC and, importantly, considering the relevant uncertainties in the observables.', 'Our results are not sensitive to the necessary choices of gravitational softening (Extended Data Fig. 4), merger threshold (Extended Data Fig. 5) or dynamical friction scheme (Extended Data Fig. 6). We used N-body simulations to validate the procedure for several examples (Extended Data Figs. 7–9). Importantly, our results were obtained using methods very much like those previously used to predict the MW-M31 merger, and when we applied our methods to the same restricted initial conditions, we obtained very similar results.', 'Although we have shown that considerable uncertainty results from the proper motion measurements of M31, we also found that a more accurate prediction requires more precise measurements of the positions, motions and masses of all participating galaxies. The dependence of the evolution of the MW-M31 system on the treatment of other LG galaxies points to further uncertainties. Cosmological simulations indicate that ~25% of the bound mass of the LG is outside the two main haloes37. The next most massive individual LG galaxies that could impact the MW-M31 orbit are M32 (an M31 satellite and possible merger remnant38) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite of the MW. Both are at least a factor of five less massive than the LMC, and we found that including the SMC, for which proper motion measurements are available, does not significantly change the MW-M31 merger probability (Extended Data Fig. 10).', 'In our calculations, we made several simplifying assumptions. We considered isotropic haloes with no substructures, constant masses and constant concentrations, and we employed idealized treatments of dynamical friction and mergers. The unaccounted effects of substructures as well as those of the cosmic environment introduce further uncertainty, particularly towards the far future. An accurate prediction of the evolution, even from perfectly precise observations, may require cosmologically constrained simulations39,40,41 that could account for these effects. Moreover, the assumptions and simplifications we have made here are probably conservative regarding our central claim, that there is considerable uncertainty about the MW-M31 merger.', 'Upcoming Gaia data releases will improve the proper motion constraints. Moreover, the mass models are continually being refined. However, it is clear that Galactic eschatology is still in its infancy, and substantial work is required before the eventual fate of the LG can be predicted with any certainty. As it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our Galaxy seem greatly exaggerated.', 'Our results are based on numerically integrated initial conditions, which are, in turn, based on Monte Carlo samples of the observational data. We describe here the generation of the Monte Carlo samples, the numerical integration and our treatment of dynamical friction and galaxy mergers. We also demonstrate the robustness of our findings to the particular choices made and show that our fiducial model and the results are conservative in predicting an uncertain future and relatively low merger probability. We also present results when the SMC is included in the analysis, in addition to the four main galaxies. To facilitate the reproduction of our results and allow future work to easily incorporate new observational data, our analysis code is flexible and public.', 'Our fiducial model consists of the MW and three other galaxies: M31, M33 and the LMC. We assumed that the sky coordinates (RA and dec.) for the centres of M31, M33 and the LMC are known. Furthermore, we assumed that the position of the Galactic centre with respect to the Sun is fixed at (RA, dec.)\u2009=\u2009(266.4051, −28.936175) (ref. 30) and d\u2009=\u20098.122\u2009kpc (ref. 31) and that the galactocentric velocity of the Sun is (12.9, 245.6, 7.78)\u2009km\u2009s−1 (refs. 30,31,32).', 'We created Monte Carlo samples for the remaining 20 variables: the four halo masses (MMW, MM31, MM33 and MLMC), the four halo concentration parameters c, the three distance moduli μ, the three sets of proper motions μδ and μα*, and three line-of-sight velocities vlos. Sampling directly in the space of the observables rather than sampling in a space of derived variables, such as Cartesian coordinates or velocities, minimizes the effect of possible correlations.', 'To allow reproducibility and identification of individual orbits across our figures when changing the parameters of the model, such as the set of galaxies included, or the numerical parameters, such as the gravitational softening length and merger threshold, we re-initialized the pseudorandom number generator with the same values for each new set of Monte Carlo samples. Although generally we show only the first 100 orbits on each plot, all quoted probabilities are computed from at least 2,500 samples each, so that the statistical errors are less than 1%.', 'The most probable values of each variable together with the ±1σ uncertainty were either taken directly from single sources in the literature or, for masses and concentrations (see ‘Halo concentrations’), estimated by us based on several sources. In creating our Monte Carlo samples, we assumed that each variable follows a Gaussian probability distribution. However, in our fiducial model, we truncated all distributions at ±2σ, corresponding to the central ~95% of values. Although Gaussian distributions are a natural assumption for measurement errors, this is not always explicitly stated, and it may not reflect the true probability distribution, especially at some distance from the most probable values. Indeed, for some variables, untruncated distributions extend to unphysical values with finite probabilities. A truncation at 2σ ensured that all variables in the samples were physical.', 'Given that our central claim is uncertainty in the future evolution of the LG, truncating the probability distributions of the observables is a conservative assumption that leads to lower uncertainty about the outcome. However, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, our results are not sensitive to the truncation at ±2σ, and the merger probability was only slightly lower when the distributions were not truncated. On the other hand, even a truncation at only ±1σ means that approximately 1/4 of orbits do not merge within 10\u2009Gyr.', 'The orbits were integrated using a symplectic leapfrog algorithm in the centre-of-mass frame, with a step size of 1\u2009Myr, approximately the time it takes for a galaxy moving at 100\u2009km\u2009s−1 to travel 0.1\u2009kpc, which is 1/200th of our merger threshold (see ‘Mergers’). Our results were not affected by the finite time step.', 'To account for the fact that the haloes are extended objects, the gravitational force between the haloes was softened with a constant softening length of 20\u2009kpc, which is like the scale radius of an NFW halo in the mass range we considered. We also considered different choices for the softening, and we show in Extended Data Fig. 4 results with softening lengths of 10, 20 or 30\u2009kpc. Using a softening length that was too small led to unphysical hard scattering events during close encounters, whereas a softening length that was too large artificially reduced the gravitational force. In the context of the LG, both of these effects could reduce the merger probability. However, we found no strong dependence of the merger probability on the softening length, with our adopted fiducial value of 20\u2009kpc resulting in the highest merger probability.', 'To estimate the effect of dynamical friction, we use a modified Chandrasekhar formula like that used in ref. 24. The classic Chandrasekhar formula assumes a point mass orbiting in the potential of a much more massive host halo, which is itself composed of much less massive particles. This approach has been expanded to account for extended satellites42, and we use the following expression to calculate the acceleration of a satellite due to dynamical friction16 once inside r200 (the radius of a sphere that encloses a mass M200) of the host halo:', 'where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the satellite, v is the velocity of the satellite relative to the host, ρ is the density of the host at the position of the satellite, X\u2009=\u2009v/(2σ) is the ratio between the orbital speed of the satellite v and the one-dimensional-velocity dispersion σ of the host at the location of the satellite, and Λ is the Coulomb factor expressed as r/ϵ, with ϵ a scale length that depends on the density of the satellite. To determine ϵ, we adopted an empirical expression derived from N-body simulations43:', 'where rs is the scale radius of the NFW halo of the satellite. Finally, to approximate the velocity dispersion of the host at the location of the satellite, we used the expression derived in ref. 23 for NFW haloes.', 'Standard dynamical friction schemes assume a clear hierarchy between the (much more massive) host and the (much less massive) satellite. According to the assumptions underlying equation (1), the satellite and host enter the calculation in clearly defined and distinct roles, with the dynamical friction force applied only on the satellite, while the host remains unaffected.', 'However, in the LG context where galaxies and haloes of similar mass are interacting, this introduces an inconsistency. In particular, in the (relatively probable) scenario that M31 has a mass close to that of the MW, the roles of the satellite and host are unclear, but their assignment changes the result of the calculation. For example, if the MW is considered the satellite, it would be accelerated by its interaction with M31 while M31 would remain unaffected, and only the motion of the MW with respect to the other galaxies would be affected while that of M31 would remain unchanged. If M31 is considered the satellite, the roles would be reversed. Accelerating only one galaxy also violates momentum conservation.', 'To make the calculation more symmetrical, in our dynamical friction calculation we distributed the dynamical friction force proportionally between the satellite (s) and host (h), thus conserving the total momentum:', 'where vs and Ms are the velocity and mass of the satellite, vh and Mh are the velocity and mass of the host, and aDF is the acceleration computed using equation (1). In the limit that the satellite is much less massive than the host, the standard ‘hierarchical’ scheme is recovered and only the satellite is accelerated, whereas in the limit that the galaxies have equal masses, both receive equal and opposite accelerations. In effect, although the standard hierarchical scheme assumes an infinite mass ratio so that the centre of mass of the system is identical to that of the host, the ‘proportional’ scheme applies dynamical friction in the centre-of-mass frame of the system. The magnitude of the dynamical friction force remains the same.', 'A small inconsistency remains in that, even when the differences in mass are small, we still assign the more massive galaxy as the host and the less massive galaxy as the satellite when calculating the magnitude of the dynamical friction, where the velocity dispersion of the host σ, but not that of the satellite, and through the Coulomb factor, the scale radius of the satellite, but not that of the host, are considered. In our spherical halo models, both the velocity dispersion and Coulomb factor depend only on the assumed masses and concentrations, and, as we discuss in ‘Halo concentrations’, the concentration of the satellite has a greater impact on the dynamical friction force. For two haloes with significantly different masses, the assignment of host and satellite is clear. For an individual case of two haloes of nearly identical masses but different (randomly assigned) concentrations, the choice of whether to calculate the dynamical friction force by treating either halo as the satellite seems arbitrary. However, for a large number of samples of nearly equal-mass interactions with randomly assigned concentrations, the dynamical friction calculations are not biased. We also assumed identical distributions of concentration parameters for all galaxies.', 'Extended Data Fig. 6 compares the orbits of the fiducial system using no dynamical friction, hierarchical dynamical friction (only from the more massive host to the less massive satellite) and our default proportional dynamical friction. It is clear that a MW-M31 merger is highly unlikely without dynamical friction. In fact, the finite merger rate without dynamical friction depends strongly on our default impact parameter threshold of 20\u2009kpc. With a lower threshold, the merger rate can become arbitrarily small. On the other hand, when dynamical friction was included, the evolution of each orbit was very similar in the hierarchical and proportional schemes, and the merger rate was not significantly affected by the exact choice of scheme.', 'Note that our semi-analytical approach to dynamical friction is still very simplistic, and although the average behaviour of N-body simulations has been used to calibrate parameters, numerical simulations also show that individual systems with non-zero internal angular momenta and substructures can have different merger times than predicted by these simple equations44. A precise prediction of the MW-M31 orbit will probably require full N-body simulations. On the other hand, we show that even a simple dynamical model that assumes no spin, no triaxiality and no substructure results in considerable uncertainty in the future evolution of the MW-M31 system.', 'Below a certain distance, the interactions of the gas and stellar components become important, and our simple approach is no longer appropriate for predicting the remaining orbital evolution. Our aim was not to predict the precise time of the merger (in fact, we argue that such a prediction is futile based on the current data), so we simply assumed that any system that passes below a threshold distance will eventually merge, and we identified this time as a lower limit for the time of the merger.', 'In our fiducial model, we adopted a value of 20\u2009kpc as the merger threshold for all galaxy interactions. When such a merger occurred between two galaxies, we combined the masses and momenta of the two galaxies at their common centre of mass and continued the integration. The concentration parameter was then set to that of the more massive galaxy.', 'Extended Data Fig. 5 compares the sensitivity of our results to adopting merger thresholds of 10, 20 and 30\u2009kpc. With a threshold of 10\u2009kpc, we found a slightly reduced MW-M31 merger probability. However, raising the threshold from 20 to 30\u2009kpc had no significant impact on our results. This confirms our assertion in the main text: due to the effect of dynamical friction, orbits either inspiral and eventually merge or do not come close enough for dynamical friction to become effective and, hence, do not merge.', 'The small fraction of MW-M31 orbits that merge with a threshold of 20\u2009kpc but do not when the threshold is set to 10 kpc approach with a small impact parameter and high velocity. This reduces the effect of dynamical friction and also allows them to escape to a large apocentre. Although this may be a possible scenario for the LG, our methods are not adequate for studying such close interactions between galaxies. To be conservative in our prediction of a low merger probability, by setting the merger threshold at 20\u2009kpc we assumed that these orbits also merge, and with an even larger threshold of 30\u2009kpc, we would still predict a similar merger rate.', 'For comparison, the best-studied merger of two galaxies with stellar masses like those of the MW and M31 are the Antennae galaxies. Their past evolution is reproduced with an orbit with pericentre ~10\u2009kpc (ref. 45), which is predicted to lead to coalescence ~1.3\u2009Gyr later46.', 'Although our main focus was on the future evolution of the MW-M31 orbit, we naturally also make predictions for the evolution of the LMC and M33. We found with the fiducial model that the LMC is certain to merge with the MW before any eventual MW-M31 merger. With a merger threshold of 20\u2009kpc, we found a median time for the LMC-MW merger of 1.3\u2009Gyr, whereas with a threshold of 10\u2009kpc, we found a median time of 1.9\u2009Gyr. For M33, with a merger threshold of 20\u2009kpc, we found an ~86% chance of a merger with M31 and a median time of 3.3\u2009Gyr, whereas with a merger threshold of 10\u2009kpc, we found an ~83% probability of a merger with M31 and a median time of 3.9 Gyr. In both cases, we also found a small probability of ~1–2% for a merger of M33 with the MW-M31 remnant after a MW-M31 merger within the next 10\u2009Gyr. Note that our simulations were not designed to study these mergers in detail and ignore, for example, the impact of the disk of the MW. Nevertheless, they broadly agree with the results of ref. 24, who previously studied the LMC-MW encounter in the presence of M31.', 'The next most massive LG member galaxy for which proper motion data28 are available is the SMC, a satellite galaxy of the MW that was probably accreted together with the LMC. We repeated our analysis including the SMC as a fifth system and show the results in Extended Data Fig. 10. Adding the SMC, whose mass is approximately 10% of that of the LMC, had no significant effect on the merger rate. The SMC properties used are listed along with those of the other galaxies in Table 1.', 'Because the M31 proper motions have the largest impact on the probability of a MW-M31 orbit and for easier comparison with earlier works, particularly ref. 13, we repeated our analysis adopting the HST\u2009+\u2009Gaia DR2 M31 proper motions of ref. 13. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the corresponding evolution of the MW-M31 distance in the same two-body MW-M31, three-body MW-M31-M33 and MW-M31-LMC, and four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC systems. The results can be directly compared to Fig. 2, which shows the same quantities in our fiducial model that used Gaia DR3 proper motions. In each case, the merger probability is slightly lower using the HST\u2009+\u2009Gaia DR2 proper motions: 40% instead of 44% for the MW-M31 system, 56% instead of 63% for the MW-M31-M33 system, 34% instead of 37% for the MW-M31-LMC system, and 48% instead of 54% for the full MW-M31-M33-LMC system. However, both sources of proper motions predict similar distributions of outcomes and a similar uncertainty about the MW-M31 merger. This difference can be attributed to the slightly lower precision of the HST\u2009+\u2009Gaia DR2 proper motions.', 'To validate the semi-analytical orbital integration method and our assumptions about dynamical friction, gravitational softening and mergers used throughout this paper, we also performed N-body simulations for five of the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC orbits. The initial masses, concentrations, positions and velocities were chosen from among the same sample of fiducial systems shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The five examples were selected based on the outcome predicted by the semi-analytical model: one system with a predicted early merger at first pericentre (‘early merger’), two with typical merger times (‘typical merger 1’ and ‘typical merger 2’) and two that do not merge within 10\u2009Gyr (‘no merger 1’ and ‘no merger 2’).', 'In each case, we created a set of NFW haloes, truncated around r200, with a sigmoid function. We used Monte Carlo sampling for the distribution function \\({f}_{i}({\\mathcal{E}})\\) for the NFW density profile ρNFW with discrete particles using the Eddington formula:', 'where \\({\\mathcal{E}}\\) is the relative energy and ΦT is the total gravitational potential.', 'The simulations were performed with the Gadget-4 code47 using a particle mass resolution of 106.5\u2009M⊙ (resulting in ~106 particles per simulation) and a gravitational softening of 200\u2009pc. The simulations were performed for the same 10-Gyr period considered throughout this work, with 100 outputs at intervals of 100\u2009Myr. We determined the centres of the systems in each output using the shrinking spheres method implemented in Pynbody. For comparison to the orbits predicted by the semi-analytical integration, these positions were linearly interpolated between snapshots. As in the fiducial model of the semi-analytical integration, we identified the time of a possible MW-M31 merger as the time when the two halo centres were separated by less than 20\u2009kpc.', 'Extended Data Fig. 7 shows the projected matter distribution in the initial conditions in each of the five systems in the centre-of-mass frame. Reflecting the high accuracy of the positions, the five initial conditions are visually very similar. However, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 8, after 10\u2009Gyr, the density distributions have diverged. In particular, in agreement with the prediction of our semi-analytical integration, the MW and M31 have merged in the first three cases, whereas in the last two cases, the two large haloes are still clearly separated by several hundreds of megaparsecs. For the early merger, the newly formed halo looks spherical, whereas in the two mergers predicted to happen later, the newly formed halo still contains substructures.', 'In a more detailed comparison, Extended Data Fig. 9 compares the evolution of the MW-M31 distances in the N-body simulation and in the semi-analytical integration, as in Fig. 2. The left-hand panel shows the three orbits that lead to a MW-M31 merger, and the right-hand panel shows the two orbits with no merger within 10\u2009Gyr, according to the semi-analytical prediction. Each pair of solid and dashed lines shows the evolution using the N-body and semi-analytical methods, respectively. The early merger case proceeds almost identically using both methods. The typical merger 1 proceeds nearly identically until the first pericentre, but the apocentre in the semi-analytical case is slightly larger, leading to a somewhat later second pericentre, when the merger occurs in both cases. Conversely, in the typical merger 2, the merger is delayed in the N-body case, following a slightly larger first pericentre and a larger apocentre than predicted by the semi-analytical method. However, in all three cases, the galaxies merge within 10\u2009Gyr using both methods.', 'The two no-merger cases, shown in the right-hand panel, also evolve in a similar way in both methods. Both reach somewhat smaller pericentres in the N-body simulation compared to the semi-analytical integration, but in both cases, dynamical friction is not strong enough to allow the orbit to decay within 10\u2009Gyr using either method, and the outcome is the same.', 'As expected, and consistent with previous works23,44, the evolution in the N-body simulations and the semi-analytical methods are not identical. However, in all five cases, they are qualitatively similar. In particular, the agreement is sufficient to show that the uncertainty about the outcome is driven by the uncertainty of the initial conditions, rather than caused by the necessary assumptions and simplifications inherent to the semi-analytical integration.', 'As discussed in Fig. 6, the assumed masses of all four galaxies and their associated uncertainties have a strong impact on the probable evolution of the MW-M31 orbit in our fiducial model. Here, we review the mass measurements and show the implications for some alternative scenarios.', 'The total mass of the MW has been extensively studied with different methods and tracers, and the accurate astrometry of the Gaia space telescope has brought a flurry of recent measurements.

Both the simple mean and median of the above measurements are 1.16\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙, but note that most methods of measuring the total mass of the MW include the mass of the LMC (at a galactocentric distance of ~50\u2009kpc, well within the virial radius, rvir, or r200), which is not always made explicit.

Reference 64 measured 1.0\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙ from the H I rotation curve, and ref. 65 measured \\(2.{0}_{-0.3}^{+0.4}\\times 1{0}^{12}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\) from the kinematics of the Giant Southern Stream. Reference 66 measured \\(1.3{5}_{-0.15}^{+0.15}\\times 1{0}^{12}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\), and ref. 67 found \\(1.{4}_{-0.2}^{+0.2}\\times 1{0}^{12}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\), both using outer halo globular clusters, whereas ref. 68 found 0.8\u2009±\u20090.1\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙ from high-velocity planetary nebulae, and ref. 69 found 1.39\u2009±\u20090.26\u2009×\u20091012 for the total mass by combining disk rotation velocities and radial velocities of satellite galaxies and globular clusters. Both the simple mean and median of the above values are 1.27\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙. Our adopted mass of MM31\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009±\u20090.4\u2009×\u20091012\u2009M⊙ in the fiducial model reflects the broad consensus of M31 mass estimates using different methods but also the considerable remaining uncertainty.', 'Mass estimates of M33 are much more sparse. More than 20\u2009years ago, refs. 70,71 measured a dark matter mass of 5\u2009×\u20091010\u2009M⊙, extrapolated out to a virial mass of 5\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ from the measured H I rotation curve, but they noted that this results in a very low baryon fraction. More recently, ref. 72 obtained a similar result using the Hα rotation curve, but noted that because the measurements extend only to a few percent of the virial radius, there are no strong constraints on the total dark matter halo. On the other hand, abundance-matching based on the observed stellar mass resulted in a substantially lower total mass of 1.7\u2009±\u20090.55\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ (refs. 73,74). Citing both the direct measurements and abundance-matching, ref. 74 adopted a mass range of 0.8–3.2\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ in their dynamical models of the M33-M31 interaction, whereas refs. 13,75 assumed a total mass of 2.5\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙. We adopted MM33\u2009=\u20093\u2009±\u20091\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ in the fiducial model, which is marginally compatible with both the extrapolated masses from rotation curve measurements and the results of abundance-matching and is in line with previous studies. However, the results from the two methods are certainly in tension.', 'Recent mass estimates of the LMC based on its effect on Galactic stellar streams include \\(1.3{8}_{-0.24}^{+0.37}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\) (ref. 76), 1.30\u2009±\u20090.3\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ (ref. 77), \\(1.8{8}_{-0.35}^{+0.4}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\) (ref. 78) and \\(1.2{9}_{-0.23}^{+0.28}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\). Reference 79 obtained good agreement between the perturbations of MW halo stars with an LMC mass of 1.5\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙. Using the abundance of probable satellites of the LMC, ref. 80 obtained a lower limit of 1.24\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙, and using the kinematics of satellites associated with the LMC, ref. 81 found \\(1.6{5}_{-0.49}^{+0.47}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\). Most recently, ref. 82 used 30 LMC globular clusters to infer a total mass of \\(1.8{0}_{-0.54}^{+1.05}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\), whereas ref. 35 found an even higher value of \\(2.{5}_{-0.8}^{+0.9}\\times 1{0}^{11}\\,{{{M}}}_{\\odot }\\) using a timing argument, which is most consistent with the Hubble flow around the LG. The simple mean of the above values is 1.6\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙, and the median is 1.5\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙. A comprehensive recent review on the effect of the LMC on the MW, including a discussion of mass measurements, was given by ref. 83, who concluded that the LMC mass is probably in the range 1–2\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙, which matches the choice MLMC\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009±\u20090.5\u2009×\u20091011\u2009M⊙ in our fiducial model.', 'Cosmological simulations show that the total mass of LG analogues is \\({\\sim} 2{5}_{-8}^{+9}\\%\\) larger than the sum of the M200 masses of the MW and M31 (ref. 37). The amount of extra matter (in addition to that of M33, which adds around 10–15%) and its distribution within the LG is not known. This forms part of the extra uncertainty that we cannot address here.', 'As explained above, we assume that for the purpose of integrating their orbits, all galaxies are represented by NFW haloes22 with the total masses M200 defined above. We assumed concentration parameters of 10\u2009±\u20092 for all galaxies, consistent with the results of cosmological simulations84,85,86,87,88 in this mass range. Although cosmological simulations show that the average concentration parameter depends on mass, the halo-to-halo scatter is significantly larger than the change in the mean concentration over this narrow mass range84. The concentration parameter does not affect the orbital calculation, except for the dynamical friction, where (for a given mass), it sets the scale radius, rs\u2009=\u2009r200/c, of the ‘satellite’ that in equation (2). Extended Data Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the merger probability on the concentration. Except for a very low M31 mass, there is only a weak dependence of the merger probability on the concentration of M31, which is more likely to be the more massive ‘host’ galaxy in the MW-M31 encounter. For the concentration of the MW, which, in the MW-M31 interaction is more likely to be the satellite, we found that the merger probability is reduced if the concentration is below ~8, that is below −1σ of our fiducial value. We found no significant dependence on the merger probability on the concentration assumed for M33 or the LMC.', 'All data used in this work are publicly available and provided as part of the analysis code listed under ʽCode Availabilityʼ.', 'The analysis in this paper was performed using Python 3.10, and made extensive use of the following open-source libraries: Astropy v.6.0.1 (ref. 89), Matplotlib v.3.8.3, NumPy v.1.26.4 (ref. 90), SciPy v.1.13.0 (ref. 91), Colossus v.1.3.5 (ref. 92) and PyNbody v.2.0.0 (ref. 93).

As in Fig. 2, solid and dashed white lines denote the orbits using the most likely values using either Gaia DR3 proper motions29 or HST+Gaia DR2 proper motions. White markers denote MW-M31 mergers, percentages indicate the fraction of orbits that merge within 10 Gyr. The merger rate is slightly lower in all cases when compared to the fiducial model that uses the more precise Gaia DR3 proper motions, but the results are qualitatively similar.', 'The distance between the MW and M31 (analogous to Fig. 2) in the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC system for different truncations of the observables. From left to right, we show results where the probability distribution for each observable in the fiducial model is truncated to ± 1σ, ± 2σ (our default model, same as in Fig. 2), or left untruncated. The fraction of systems that merge is only slightly increased when the distributions are clipped at ± 2σ or above.', 'In each case, we consider the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC system, and plot the merger probability similar to Fig. 6. From left to right, in the top row, we show the dependencies on mass and concentration of the MW and M31, while in the bottom row, we show those of M33 and the LMC, respectively. The concentration parameter affects the merger rate only for the lower mass system in the MW-M31 encounter, which is the MW in most cases. A concentration parameter of the MW below 7 (− 1.5σ), particularly in combination with a low MW mass results in a significantly lower merger rate. Unlike their masses, the concentration parameters for M33 and the LMC have no discernible effects on the MW-M31 merger probability.', 'MW-M31 orbits (analogous to Fig. 1) and distance between the MW and M31 (analogous to Fig. 2) in the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC system for different softening lengths. From left to right, we show results with a softening length of 10 kpc, 20 kpc (our default value), and 30 kpc. A softening length that is too small can lead to some unrealistically strong kicks in close encounters, while a softening length that is too large weakens the overall gravitational attraction. However, the merger fraction is not significantly affected by the choice of softening length within this range.', 'The distance between the MW and M31 (analogous to Fig. 2) in the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC system for different merger thresholds. From left to right, we show results with a threshold of 10 kpc, 20 kpc or 30 kpc for all mergers. The MW-M31 merger probability is not very sensitive to the assumed merger threshold, and we obtain almost the same merger probability even with a (very generous) threshold of 30 kpc.', 'MW-M31 orbits (top two rows, analogous to Fig. 1) and distance between the MW and M31 (bottom row, analogous to Fig. 2) in the four-body MW-M31-M33-LMC system for different softening lengths. The left column assumes no dynamical friction, the middle column uses our default “proportional” scheme where the dynamical friction force is divided such that equal and opposite dynamical forces are applied to both host and satellite, the right column uses the “hierarchical” scheme where dynamical friction is only applied to the less massive object. Dynamical friction is essential for orbits to decay and for the MW-M31 merger to occur, but the probability of an MW-M31 merger is not sensitive to the scheme used. However, due to its momentum-conserving property, mergers in the proportional scheme are more likely to occur close to the original orbital plane compared to the hierarchical scheme.', 'In each case, the MW is located at the bottom right, with the LMC perceptible as a small substructure close to the cenre of the MW. M31 and M33 are located in the top left. Differences between the five systems are subtle, reflecting the (small) differences in the present positions, and the differences in masses.', 'The five systems are the same as those shown in Fig. 7. In the three cases where the semi-analytical integration predicted a merger, the MW-M31 haloes have merged into a single halo, with residual substructures visible in the “Typical merger 2” scenario. In the two cases where the semi-analytical integration predicted no merger, the MW-M31 haloes remain separated by several hundred Mpc.', 'Solid and dashed lines show the distance between the MW and M31 in the N-body simulations and in the semi-analytical numerical integration, respectively, for five example systems. The left panel shows the distance for three cases where the MW and M31 were predicted to merge by the semi-analytical model, while the right panel shows two cases where no merger was predicted to occur within 10 Gyr. The dotted lines indicate the 20 kpc merger threshold of our fiducial model. In all five cases, the N-body simulations and the semi-analytical model predict the same outcome, although the merger time of the intermediate cases differ.', 'In the top row, we show the MW-M31 two-body system, and the MW-M31-M33-LMC four-body system in the fiducial model, corresponding to the top row of Fig. 2. In the bottom row, we add the SMC to both systems, that is we show the MW-M31-SMC three-body system and the MW-M31-M33-LMC-SMC five-body system. The inclusion of the SMC has only a small effect on most MW-M31 orbits and does not significantly affect the total merger rate.', 'Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
