Hence, this retrospective cohort study used population-based data to investigate the incidence rates of appendiceal adenocarcinoma across birth cohorts in the United States.

It also showed that local drift, a model-based estimate of annual percentage change in incidence rates specific to each age group, of appendiceal adenocarcinoma was significantly different from net drift, suggestive of a birth cohort effect.
