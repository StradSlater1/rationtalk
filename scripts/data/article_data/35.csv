But if dad already has a phone he likes, you can pick up something to accessorize it with – a new smartwatch, for example. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is built for durability and long battery life. It has advanced health tracking features like ECG.', 'Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra', 'There is only one version – a 4G-connected 47mm watch. This allows it to work independently of a phone, whether to track exercise outside or because dad forgot his phone. This offer comes bundled with a 25W charger – a bit overkill for the watch (it supports 10W), but you can use it for phones too.', 'Alternatively, the Samsung Galaxy Watch7 is available in 40mm and 44mm sizes. It’s a bit more stylish than the Ultra – at least its vibe isn’t so outdoorsy – and it only has Bluetooth by default, making it a good deal more affordable. There is an LTE version too, if you think that is helpful. The Watch7 is bundled with a free SmartTag2, which can be used to track keys, a backpack or anything else, really.', 'You can also go back in time a bit and pick up the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 Classic, currently the last model with a rotating bezel. It’s available in 43mm and 47mm sizes and also has a 4G option if you want it.', 'Another piece of kit you can get is the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro. These have great sound quality, better ANC than before and the stems do make for easier controls.', 'Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro', 'The buds can be connected to a watch too, not just a phone. Especially one with 4G – the watch+buds combo can handle calls, stream music, even do messages with voice transcription. There’s AI on hand to answer questions too.', 'Alternatively, the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE are a pretty cheap add-on, if just a watch doesn’t seem enough. These don’t have stems, but they have wings that keep them stable in the ear. They do have ANC too, it’s just not on the level of the Buds3 Pro.', 'We may get a commission from qualifying sales.', 'Not bad but already have watch 6 classic and smart tag 2 alongside with buds 2 pro and 45w charger.
