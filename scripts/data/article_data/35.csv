However, one of the promised upgrades was an upgraded version of Siri, which has reportedly faced multiple delays. A new report sheds some light on the challenges faced by the company, as it attempts to rebuild Siri to compete with more advanced voice assistants from rivals like Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity that all offer support for AI features."", 'Citing employees who recently left the firm, the Financial Times reports that Apple has faced technological challenges while attempting to introduce support for large language models (LLMs) on its Siri voice assistant. These upgrades were expected to enable Siri to deliver more conversational responses, with up-to-date information. Apple previously admitted that the Siri upgrades it promised last year were delayed and not expected to arrive until next year.', 'According to the report, the company attempted to integrate its own LLMs with the existing version of Siri, which already features some machine learning technology. This led to software bugs that have delayed the development of the product. Currently, users can ask Siri to control various system settings, or use a built-in ChatGPT button to access information on the internet.', ""Apple's rivals reportedly built their voice assistants without using existing software, which means these fresh projects (ChatGPT, Gemini AI, and Perplexity) were less complicated, which reduced the number of bugs in the software."", 'Another reason why Apple\'s Siri upgrade faced delays was due to the company\'s decision to rely on ""smaller"" AI models, and keeping all user data on the device, to protect user privacy.

Apple punts on Siri updates as it struggles to keep up in the AI race,https://www.theverge.com/apple/682984/apple-punts-on-siri-updates-as-it-struggles-to-keep-up-in-the-ai-race,"['Siri was MIA at WWDC after Apple missed its window on some huge upgrades last year.', '', 'Apple’s WWDC 2025 had new software, Formula 1 references, and a piano man crooning the text of different app reviews. But one key feature got the short end of the stick: Siri.', 'Although the company continuously referenced Apple Intelligence and pushed new features like live translation for Messages, FaceTime, and phone calls, Apple’s AI assistant was barely mentioned. In fact, the most attention Siri got was when Apple explained that some of its previously promised features were running behind schedule.', 'To address what many saw as the elephant in the room, Apple’s keynote briefly mentioned that it had updated Siri to be “more natural and more helpful,” but that personalization features were still on the horizon. Those features were first mentioned at last year’s WWDC, with a rollout timeline “over the course of the next year.”', '“We’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s SVP of software engineering, said during Monday’s keynote. “This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”', 'Apple’s relative silence on Siri stands out', 'Apple has long been criticized for the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence and for falling behind competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in the race to build generative AI apps and services. Apple’s AI models are rarely mentioned alongside its competitors when it comes to power users exploring real-life benefits, let alone more advanced AI agent capabilities.', 'The company’s relative silence on a personalized Siri this year stood out for a handful of reasons. For one, there’s Apple’s own marketing push: last year, it ran TV ads for a revamped Siri showing features that still haven’t arrived.', 'Then there are Apple’s competitors. Google and Microsoft are both pushing hard on AI and moving to rapidly integrate it into their operating systems. For example, ahead of Google’s I/O conference last month, Android users were the first to get free access to a live Gemini feature that allowed the AI assistant to see and respond to images and items on your screen. And as part of Microsoft’s Build conference last month, Microsoft announced AI shortcuts in Windows 11’s File Explorer that let users click on a file and immediately see suggestions like blurring aspects of a photo or summarizing content.', 'Meanwhile, Apple Intelligence’s stumbles have given people plenty to poke fun at in the months since their rollout. The feature’s rocky debut included notification summaries so off the mark that the company disabled them for some app categories after the BBC reported the tool would conflate multiple headlines into inaccurate synopses.', 'The company’s strategy on Monday was to roll out a wide swath of small, functional updates powered by Apple Intelligence — and partly by ChatGPT — that could help it catch up to competitors in terms of translation and search. Apple’s Image Playground now integrates with OpenAI’s technology, and users can tap into ChatGPT to change a friend’s photo into the style of an oil painting or other types of art. Apple gave developers access to the on-device large language model behind Apple Intelligence, and it also debuted live translation features that allow users to translate between languages in Messages, FaceTime, and phone calls.', 'At WWDC, Apple also pushed visual intelligence features aimed at allowing users to “search and take action on anything they’re viewing” across different apps. “Users can ask ChatGPT questions about what they’re looking at on their screen to learn more, as well as search Google, Etsy, or other supported apps to find similar images and products,” according to Apple.', 'Some had been waiting for Apple to use WWDC as an opportunity to announce it was expanding its AI options for iOS beyond ChatGPT — for instance, allowing Siri to tap into Google’s Gemini for complex user queries — but that didn’t happen this time around.', 'Last June, during a live session after an Apple keynote, Federighi mentioned that he hopes Apple Intelligence will eventually allow users “to choose the models they want,” specifically name-dropping Gemini. One of Apple’s backend updates in February hinted at a Gemini integration, and in April, during Google’s search monopoly trial proceedings, CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to ink a deal with Apple by mid-2025, with a rollout by the end of this year.

Versions with 3 billion, 7 billion, 33 billion, and 150 billion parameters are now said to be ""in active use.""', 'Like ChatGPT, the 150 billion parameter model relies on the cloud, and its size means it is much more powerful than on-device Apple Intelligence, whose foundational models are 3 billion parameters.', 'With the help of an internal testing tool called ""Playground,"" Apple has run benchmarks on the model that suggest it ""approaches the quality of recent ChatGPT rollouts."" However, there are still said to be concerns over its tendency to hallucinate. Meanwhile, ""philosophical differences"" remain among company executives, though Gurman provided no additional details on what they might be.', 'A previous report revealed that Apple has AI offices in Zurich, where employees are working on the all-new software architecture for Siri. The model is expected to eventually replace \u200cSiri\u200c\'s current ""hybrid"" architecture that has been incoherently layered up with different functionality.', 'Gurman reports that Apple is also testing a chatbot model dubbed ""Knowledge"" internally that can access the internet to gather and synthesize data from multiple sources. Presumably this would become another Siri capability, but the project is said to be led by Robby Walker, who recently saw Siri removed from his command. According to Gurman, employees familiar with the project say the chatbot project has also been dogged by the same problems that delayed the Siri overhaul.', ""It's still not clear when Apple will implement these technologies, and the company is unlikely to offer launch roadmaps at WWDC this month, given the blowback it received for announcing Apple Intelligence features at last year's conference that still have yet to launch."", ""In the meantime, Google's Gemini is expected to be added to iOS 26 as an alternative to ChatGPT in \u200cSiri\u200c, and Apple is also said to be in talks with Perplexity to add their AI service as another option in the future, for both \u200cSiri\u200c and Safari search."", 'Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ' ', 'MacRumors attracts a broad audience of both consumers and professionals interested in the latest technologies and products.

The smart assistant was due to get Personal Context capabilities to better understand you, your life, and your device. It was one of the features that I was most excited for. As you most likely know (I’ll explain more later), Apple delayed the feature.', 'But I was holding out hope – foolishly, it turns out – that we’d see the long-promised Personal Context feature make its way to our iPhones at WWDC 2025. Unfortunately, Apple delivered a grand total of nothing on that front. Instead, what we got was Apple VP Craig Federighi, breezing past the subject like it was an afterthought.', 'You’d be forgiven for missing it. Craig’s exact words were: “We’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal. This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.” That’s it. That’s all we got. A vague nod and a promise to maybe tell us more later. Sigh.', 'And this one really stings because last year’s WWDC sold me a dream. A Siri that finally understood who I am, what I do, who I talk to, and could actually act like a digital assistant instead of a glorified voice search box. I bought into the idea that Siri would start understanding my routine, messaging habits, and – dare I say – be helpful. But that dream is now lost somewhere in iCloud.', 'The delay was officially confirmed back in March, when Apple admitted it needed more time to work on the features. Fine. I get that. But perhaps the tech giant could have worked that out before debuting it to the world. And apparently debuting it to software teams at the same time.', 'Apple also shuffled leadership behind the scenes. That move alone screamed “we messed up” louder than any press release ever could. And the kicker? Bloomberg reported that the version of Siri with Personal Context was functional, just not reliable. It only got things right about two-thirds of the time. Which, while not great, is honestly probably better than current-day Siri.', 'It’s not just disappointing – it’s slightly embarrassing. Even Apple thinks so, having scrubbed all mentions of Personal Context from the web where it can. So here I am, still waiting for Siri to do something intelligent. At this rate, I’ll be asking her to remind me when Personal Context finally arrives.

In fact, Apple has advertised as much since last WWDC, showing off its ChatGPT-like assistant in commercials and promotional materials."", ""It's been nearly a year since WWDC 2024, and that new  Siri is still not here. The thing is, it likely won't be for a long time. How long is anyone's guess (I've been tracking the delays here), but one thing seems likely: Apple is probably not showing off AI Siri at next week's WWDC 2025."", ""In a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman last month, he describes a chaotic situation regarding Apple's AI department. The piece is a fascinating and in-depth look at Apple's AI woes, and I won't give a detailed summary of the entire article. However, I will briefly discuss what's going on, and how it related to AI Siri."", 'Executive leadership at Apple, including senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi, didn\'t believe AI was worth the investment, and didn\'t want to allocate resources away from Apple\'s core software components in order to develop the technology. But once Federighi used ChatGPT following its late 2022 launch, he did a 180. He and other Apple executives began meeting with the big AI companies to learn everything they could, and pushed for iOS 18 to have ""as many AI-powered features as possible.""', ""While Apple's AI department already existed before this scramble (the company had poached Google's artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea), the engineers simply couldn't match the quality or accuracy of the tools provided by other companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, who had a huge head start on generative AI."", 'That lag manifested in two ways: First, many of the AI features that Apple did bring to market were half-baked. Apple Intelligence\'s notification summaries feature, for example, infamously made some major mistakes, such as ""summarizing"" a BBC news alert to say that United Healthcare shooting suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself. (Apple later disabled the feature for news alerts.)', ""Second, because Apple couldn't rely on its own tech to carry Apple Intelligence, they outsourced some tech to another AI company. While there was much debate about which company they should work with (Giannandrea wanted to work with Google and bring Gemini to iOS), Apple eventually settled for ChatGPT—which is why OpenAI's bot is built into your iPhone today."", ""Apple's lack of AI focus meant they missed the rush to acquire GPUs—the main processing unit used for training and running AI models. They also have strict privacy policies when it comes to user data, which severely limits what data they can use to train their models. (Some might say that's actually a good thing, and pause to think about the companies that do have a plethora of data to train with.)"", 'While Apple was able to get some AI features working ""well"" enough to ship, Siri was never among them. In order to bring AI to Siri, the company had to split Siri\'s ""brain"" in two—one featuring the existing code, used for traditional Siri tasks like setting timers and making calls, and the other for AI. While the AI side in a vacuum can work, integrating it with the other half of Siri\'s brain is problematic, and is the cause of much of the delay.', ""But rather than wait until Apple figured out how to get AI  Siri working to actually show off its new features, the company went ahead and heavily marketed them. During WWDC 2024, we saw prerecorded demos of Siri taking complex requests and generating helpful answers by accessing both a knowledge base about the user in question, as well as an awareness of what was happening on-screen. A prime example was an Apple employee asking  Siri about their mom's travel itinerary: Siri dove through the employee's messages with their mom to draw up the plans."", 'Apple even hired Bella Ramsey of The Last of Us to promote AI Siri features: In the commercial, Ramsey sees someone at a party they recognize but don\'t remember the name of. Ramsey then asks Siri ""What\'s the name of the guy I had a meeting with a couple of months ago at Cafe Granel?"" Siri immediately responds with the acquaintance\'s name, pulling from a calendar entry. Ramsey doesn\'t need to say the exact date or where to pull the information from, since AI Siri is presumably contextually aware, and can understand vague responses. (Apple has since deleted the ad from its YouTube account.)', ""Since then, AI features have trickled in on various iOS 18 updates, but not AI Siri. We've been following reports (mostly from Gurman) that Apple's engineers were having trouble getting it to work, and each delay pushed AI Siri's release to the next major iOS 18 update. At one point, we thought it could come with iOS 18.4: As Gurman reports in this latest piece, that was the plan, but Federighi himself was surprised to see that the AI Siri features didn't work on a beta for 18.4."", 'Siri\'s big AI upgrade was delayed again, now ""indefinitely."" According to Gurman\'s sources, there are no plans to announce Siri\'s new features alongside iOS 19 (or iOS 26, if rumors at to be believed) at next week\'s WWDC event. While the goal is to get AI Siri out for iOS 26 at some point, the situation is dire—Siri\'s features reportedly don\'t work a third of the time, and every time you fix one of Siri\'s major bugs, ""three more crop up.""', ""Gurman's sources say Apple has an AI department in Zurich working on a new LLM-based Siri that scraps the two-sided brain of the current assistant. Siri also has a new leader, Mike Rockwell, who replaced Giannandrea this spring. Some sources even say that Apple's internal chatbot is now rivaling ChatGPT, which could prove useful if integrated with Siri."", ""There are reasons to be mildly optimistic about Siri's long-term future, but there's no denying that the last year has been a disaster.

Under a new leadership team and with a renewed focus on intelligent user support, Siri is expectedly to undergo its most significant upgrade in over a decade. The forthcoming features promise a far more intuitive, personalised, and capable digital assistant experience.', 'According to a 9To5Mac report, a cornerstone of Siri’s upcoming transformation is its deeper integration within Apple’s ecosystem. Thanks to a privacy-conscious approach to user data, Siri in iOS 26 will likely be able to deliver context-aware and highly personalised assistance.', '5% OFF', '₹54999', 'Get This', '₹15999', 'Check Details', '₹49990', 'Check Details', '13% OFF', '₹39998', 'Get This', '₹19999', 'Check Details', 'Reportedly, Apple has shared striking examples of what this might look like in practice. For instance, users could ask, “Play that podcast Jamie recommended,” and Siri will seamlessly locate and begin playback—drawing from messages or emails where the podcast was mentioned. Similarly, asking “When is Mum’s flight landing?” will prompt Siri to fetch real-time flight data by cross-referencing personal calendar entries and tracking services.', 'Such enhancements could signal a clear intention to make Siri not only smarter but also more human-like in its ability to understand and respond naturally to user needs.', 'While Siri has long been able to handle basic tasks, it has struggled to move beyond simple commands. That is set to change with iOS 26, which introduces a major expansion in the range of supported voice actions—now including multi-app capabilities.', 'This means users will likely be able to give more complex, cross-app instructions without lifting a finger. For example, one might say, “Add the photos from this morning to my Birding note,” and Siri will complete the task by working across Photos and Notes in the background.', 'Such a shift could bring Apple closer to delivering the long-promised reality of hands-free productivity, freeing users from the need to juggle apps manually for routine actions.', 'Another expected standout improvement is anticipated to be Siri’s newfound onscreen awareness. Currently, Siri offers limited interaction with onscreen content, such as setting a reminder linked to an email. However, iOS 26 could aim to take this several steps further.', 'With the new system, Siri will likely gain the ability to comprehend and act on content visible on the user’s screen across more apps. For example, if a contact shares their address via Messages, users will be able to say, “Add this address to his contact card,” and Siri will complete the action accordingly.', 'This onscreen understanding is expected to streamline many everyday tasks, reinforcing Siri’s role as a reliable digital assistant that works more intuitively within the Apple environment.', 'Catch all the Technology News and Updates on Live Mint.

Its AI features are meant to run on-device through smaller models, which sounds noble but apparently makes the tech even harder to get working properly.

Apple’s AI boss John Giannandrea, who joined from Google in 2018, has seen the Siri team shifted to Mike Rockwell, best known for that overpriced ski mask called the Vision Pro. Some insiders blame fragmented leadership and a lack of money thrown at the problem. Others just think Job’s Mob didn’t take AI seriously until it was way too late.', 'Now it’s leaning on OpenAI integration to keep Siri vaguely useful while rivals like OpenAI, Google and even Perplexity launch assistants that actually know what they’re doing.

So ends the reign of arguably the most effective voice assistant of its time, gone without a care in the world.', 'But Google’s decision to kill it, instead of keeping the Google Assistant name, may have been smart. “It’s primarily branding,” says Chris Harrison, who directs the Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. “But it underlines a technology reason, which is that the previous generation of these assistants really weren’t very much like assistants. Asking for the weather and setting a timer—not very sophisticated. You wouldn’t really ask a personal assistant for those mundane tasks.”', ""Gemini is completely different. It can rummage through your emails to find the location of your kid's soccer match, parse through large documents, and when paired with a camera-enabled device, can understand what you're seeing and offer help. Its capabilities are vastly superior to what Google Assistant could do. Apple's goal is to achieve similar results in a more privacy-friendly way—so that when you have Siri connect to ChatGPT, your data is not passed off to OpenAI."", '“Apple thought Siri\'s capabilities would grow, but that didn\'t really materialize; Siri kind of atrophied out of the gate,"" Harrison says. “Now, we\'re in this new generation of things that are really much more like assistants—they can do reasoning, personalization.” But while Google Assistant and Gemini both have voice interfaces and at a first glance may share a similar look, they\'re two different applications. “Simply renaming it Google Assistant 2.0 would not spur people to use it in a fundamentally different way.” It seems that switch to Gemini has been key to moving customer understanding along.', ""However, it's fair to say that Apple and even Amazon's Alexa have had a cultural cachet that Google Assistant never enjoyed. It wasn't unusual to hear Siri or Alexa's name in a movie or TV show; they were much more recognizable than Google's generic-named voice assistant. This may be why Amazon decided to keep the Alexa branding and simply add a “+” icon to denote the new souped-up version of Alexa powered by the latest large language models—and perhaps why Apple is still hanging onto Siri."", ""This might have all been OK if Apple actually delivered on its promise and released a functioning, much-improved Siri when it originally said it would. With a massive marketing push to put Apple Intelligence in everyone's mind (maybe a regretful move), it would have been a great opportunity to wow users with a much-improved Siri. Months later, customers are left wondering why Siri—new look and all—still lags behind."", ""But the broader problem affecting all large language models isn't just the branding, but the user interface. Harrison compares it to the days of command-line computing and the shift to the graphical user interface (GUI) in the ’80s and ’90s. It wasn't the graphics that made the latter more popular, but the discoverability and explorable interface. In the command-line era, you had to remember how to do anything. With GUI, you could put anyone in front of a computer, and they'd be able to figure out how to navigate the operating system."", 'If you put someone in front of ChatGPT or Gemini, say it\'s an incredible tool, and tell them to ask it anything, they\'ll just stare blankly at the blinking prompt. “It\'s like we\'ve gone back 30 years in interface design. They have no idea what to do or say."" Harrison says he did this exact experiment with his parents: They asked what the weather was tomorrow, and the AI responded that it didn\'t have that information.', '“We\'ve regressed in discoverability,"" he says. “A regular person, not the tech people, if all they\'ve been doing is setting timers with Siri for the past 10 years, and now they have to think about it in a fundamentally different way—that\'s an extremely hard problem. Some sort of renaming of the application is going to be important.""', ""Saying goodbye to Siri would be a big move for Apple—after all, it has spent more that a decade investing in it. But most people today still use it for playing music, checking weather, and setting timers, and aren't even pushing the boundaries of its current, relatively limited, capabilities. It's hard to see that changing anytime soon, even if Siri's feature-packed next generation arrives as promised."", '“For 99 percent of the planet, this kind of AI revolution has totally gone over their head,” Harrison says. Like the 10-year transition from command line to graphical user interfaces, rethinking the way we use these personal voice assistants will take time and education, but maybe a new name will help Apple with the transition.', 'Join the WIRED community to add comments.', 'BJARTE', '20 hours ago', '""Gemini is completely different.

While Apple is reportedly working on a major upgrade to its voice assistant using large language models (LLMs), insiders say the project has been tougher than expected."", 'According to a report from Financial Times, the company has been trying to build these LLM features on top of the existing Siri system, which already works on millions of devices worldwide. But this approach has brought several issues. According to ex-employees, combining old machine learning code with newer AI models has caused frequent bugs and slowed down development. On the other hand, companies like OpenAI, which started from scratch with their voice assistants, have avoided such problems and moved ahead faster.', 'One former Apple employee said that it was clear from the beginning that just adding new layers to Siri would not be enough. Inside Apple, some leaders had described the plan as “climbing the hill,” meaning they wanted to slowly improve Siri instead of completely rebuilding it. However, the results have reportedly been disappointing. “It’s clear they stumbled,” the person said, highlighting the gap between expectations and reality.', '', 'As of now, there is no confirmation on when the new version of Siri will be released. While there are chances that Apple may talk about it during WWDC 2025, reports suggest the final rollout could take until 2027. That is still a long way off, especially at a time when rivals are already offering more advanced conversational assistants.', 'Even though Apple is known for waiting until its products are polished, the delay in Siri’s upgrade raises questions about whether the company is falling behind in the AI race. For now, fans and developers might get a preview of what is coming, but they should not expect the new Siri to be available anytime soon.', 'The latest Apple WWDC 2025 event will start tonight at 10:30PM and it is expected to showcase updates to Apple’s operating systems — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, visionOS 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26. A fresh design across platforms and improvements in Apple’s AI tools are expected to take the spotlight, according to several reports.

But major expected updates to its AI platform and voice assistant did not show up.', 'The iPhone-maker has been under pressure to deliver since its Apple Intelligence suite was unveiled at last year’s WWDC, but was perceived as underdeveloped and the promised updates have failed to eventuate. Key among them are plans to evolve the Siri voice assistant into a smarter and more capable agent that understands context, akin to ChatGPT.', 'Apple’s software updates for later this year have a new ‘liquid glass’ visual design.', '“As we’ve shared, we’re continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, on stage at WWDC.', '“This work needed more time to reach a high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”', 'Industry watchers also anticipated an announcement that Google’s Gemini would join OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a service that could be leveraged through Apple Intelligence, but that didn’t eventuate.

The new MacOS will also be version 26, but inkeeping with the tradition of naming each version after a location in California it will be called MacOS Tahoe.', 'All the operating systems have a new visual style Apple is calling Liquid Glass, designed to look like various layers of coloured or transparent glass. Elements have also become more rounded and fluid; for example, the big glass numerals on the iPhone lock screen clock change size dynamically depending on your background photo and notification content. This is the first major visual change for the iPhone in 12 years, with the current look being a refined take on the interface of iOS 7 from 2013.', 'Some iPhone apps, including Camera, Phone and Messages, are also getting pared-back redesigns.', 'The iPad interface is becoming more desktop-like.', 'Apple did announce some new AI iPhone features, which bring to mind similar options already available on some Android phones.

Hold Assist detects hold music and can silence the call, giving you a ring when a human is back on the line.', 'Visual Intelligence, which currently works through the camera to answer questions about real-world objects, will be expanded to work on screenshots. It will be able to copy text, automatically create calendar entries, search Google, ask ChatGPT and more.
