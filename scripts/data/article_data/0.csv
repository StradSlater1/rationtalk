Tim Walz made the controversial decision to deploy the state\'s National Guard amid the 2020 riots in Minneapolis, but Noem on Sunday criticized Walz for what she said were ""very bad decisions,"" claiming he ""let his city burn for days on end."" Mr. Trump also deployed the National Guard in June 2020 to Washington, D.C, to quell protests. ', 'And as California\'s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged that the state had things under control after protests broke out in L.A. in reaction to ICE operations in recent days, Noem claimed Newsom ""has proven that he makes bad decisions.""', '""The president knows that [Newsom] makes bad decisions, and that\'s why the President chose the safety of this community over waiting for Gov. Newsom to get some sanity,"" Noem added. ""And that\'s one of the reasons why these National Guard soldiers are being federalized so they can use their special skill set to keep peace.""', 'Mr. Trump signed a memo Saturday using Title 10 authority to order the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County following clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators in Paramount, California, and large-scale protests elsewhere in the county.

I spent the day documenting the protests as they moved around Downtown, from the Metropolitan Detention Center to City Hall to the 101 freeway.', 'It’s hard to say definitively, since chaos was unfolding in a few locations, but the law-enforcement response to the protests I photographed felt excessive. On multiple occasions, I saw what appeared to be police opening fire directly into crowds with “less lethal” rounds in response to plastic water bottles being thrown at them. Videos are circulating of protesters being run over by horses and a journalist being shot with a rubber bullet. I narrowly missed being hit by rounds several times. I was unsuccessful in avoiding getting tear-gassed.', 'There is, of course, some anxiety when documenting these events that the photos and videos you’re taking may feed into the narrative about Los Angeles being pushed by Trump and his supporters on the right, which characterizes the protesters, as Trump wrote on social media, as “RIOTERS & LOOTERS.” Images of destruction and violence are pretty irresistible and don’t show the full picture of what was going on on the ground. Whenever I took a photo of something on fire or something being thrown at police, it felt like I was one of 100 photographers doing so. (I have now seen the shirtless person on top of a trashed Waymo pictured below from around 50 different angles in addition to my own.) By contrast, I have seen maybe one photo from the peaceful protest that took place outside City Hall early in the day. And even when mayhem did erupt, it was generally possible to walk half a block to buy an ice cream from a street vendor or have your photo taken with the person who turned up dressed as Labubu. Here’s what I saw.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVNRMHR3WTBFNVZGRm5aV2hDVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
ICE raids grow tense as protesters confront immigration agents,https://www.npr.org/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5425524/ice-raids-grow-tense-as-protesters-confront-immigration-agents,"['Martin Kaste', 'ICE agents used what appeared to be a smoke device to disperse the crowd near Buona Forchetta in San Diego, Calif., on May 30, 2025.', 'Over the past several days, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents around the country have contended with angry crowds protesting their actions in cities from Minneapolis to Chicago to Los Angeles. This most recent spate of encounters has become heated.', '""It got out of control because of the way that they showed up,"" says San Diego council member Sean Elo-Rivera, referring to ICE agents conducting a raid on a local Italian restaurant. Members of the public surged around the agents, at one point surrounding their cars. The immigration authorities discharged flash-bangs, leading to a chaotic scene.', 'Elo-Rivera posted a photo of federal agents dressed in tactical gear outside the restaurant, with the word ""TERRORISTS"" written over it. It drew an angry reaction from the Trump administration, but he says he believes the operation was meant to be intimidating.', '""They wanted to make a show of it, so they did it on Friday night at dinnertime. They wanted to make a show of this so they showed up with assault rifles. They wanted to make a show of this so they showed up in far more numbers than they needed to,"" Elo-Rivera says. ""And the use of masks I think is incredibly concerning.""', 'ICE agents, as well as other federal agents delegated to work with ICE, are increasingly wearing masks during operations, something many people find objectionable. But at a press conference on Monday, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said agents had good reasons to do so.', '""People are out there taking photos of [agents\'] names, their faces and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves,"" Lyons says. ""So I\'m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I\'m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line and their family on the line because people don\'t like what immigration enforcement is.""', 'At the same press conference, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge for New England Michael Krol cautioned those who ""impede or obstruct operations or those who dare to threaten or assault our law enforcement officers,"" and he warned of potential investigations and prosecutions.', ""But civil rights groups say bystanders have the right to observe, protest and shout questions. Kate Evans, director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Duke Law, says ICE agents don't necessarily have to answer questions from bystanders, but those questions can still be important."", '""They\'re essentially functioning as kind of Fourth Amendment observers and informing the people who are actually the subject of the seizure — the arrest — that they have the right to request a warrant,"" Evans says.', 'U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents execute a criminal search warrant on May 30, 2025, at Buona Forchetta in San Diego, Calif.', 'She says one thing an observer can point out is that ICE agents need to show a judicial warrant — one signed by a judge, not just an ICE official — in order to enter a private space without permission.', 'Agents have more latitude in public spaces. Evans says in order to arrest someone on civil immigration violations, agents should generally have an administrative warrant — the kind signed by ICE itself — showing the reason for the arrest. But in some circumstances, she says agents may also arrest someone if they have probable cause and reason to believe the person will get away.', '""Immigration laws and regulations are not easily accessible for a lay person,"" Evans says.', 'Adding to the confusion is the fact that sometimes, when ICE agents are spotted on operations, they\'re actually part of larger criminal investigations. That appears to have been the case in Minneapolis on Tuesday, when a crowd came out to protest what many assumed was an immigration raid at a taco restaurant, chanting ""Abolish ICE!"" Later, federal officials said it was a criminal investigation.', '""The thing is, if you don\'t want to confuse people, why would you send ICE agents to the scene?"" asks Ryan Perez, who joined the crowd. Perez works with a nonprofit called COPAL, which trains ""constitutional observers"" to monitor ICE raids. Perez says the group is cautious, because sometimes people will mistakenly issue false alarms about ICE raids that are actually other kinds of law enforcement operations.', ""At the same time, he says you have to understand people's response when heavily-armed ICE agents appear on the street."", '""They intentionally brought armored vehicles in a residential area and a business corridor in front of, like, very high traffic areas. That\'s a stunt to me,"" Perez says of the operation on Tuesday. ""It just reminded me of the protests and the reactions of officers post-George Floyd.

They're now on standby."", 'Tam, this is clearly a fight that Donald Trump wants. What is his strategy in escalating the response?', 'Tamara Keith:', 'President Trump, if you go back to his first term in office, he wants wanted to use the military, use force against protesters.', 'He sees the violent imagery, he sees it on television, and his reaction is to want to send in the military. Back in 2020, he said — quote — ""If the looting starts, the shooting starts""', 'There were — that was in Minnesota that he was referring to, but there were also protests that turned violent in California back then.

To Tam's point about this is a fight that Donald Trump wants, Democrats know that too. They can see the poll numbers. They remember 2020. They remember 2024."", ""And when it comes to issues like this, whether it's crime, whether it is, and now, today, on the issue of immigration, Donald Trump has the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't have on a lot of other issues. So this is a fight that he wants to have. What Democrats are saying is, let's not give him more fuel to keep this fight going."", ""You see the mayor of Los Angeles, Gavin Newsom, others saying, please, if you want to protest, that's great. Don't turn it violent. Don't allow this to turn into something that benefits Donald Trump, the signs, the scenes of chaos and police in the streets."", ""The question going forward, I think, is how Democrats do talk about these issues, it's going to be really important for the — not just what's happening today in Los Angeles, but just writ large. I think there has been a lot of pullback and a lot of hand-wringing from Democrats about an issue which they used to have an advantage on during the — Trump's first term, they have a disadvantage on now."", ""This issue isn't going away.

One thing I will note is that, in California itself, the population of California, 73 percent of adults in the Public Policy Institute of California survey from February of this year said that there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally. A vast majority say that immigrants benefit California.', 'So, in terms of the population of the state, his view is not popular in the state, but that also sort of heightens the fight, which is what he wants.', 'Geoff Bennett:', ""In the time that remains, let's talk about the infighting within the Democratic National Committee, because Politico reported that the current DNC chair, the new DNC chair, Ken Martin, just months into the job, he privately told Democratic leaders that his new vice chair, David Hogg, you see him there, is making it hard to lead the party."", ""And Hogg has vowed to spend millions of dollars in safe blue primaries to oust incumbent Democrats that he views as ineffective.

So what's all this mean and what's it mean for the party?"", 'Tamara Keith:', ""Yes, there's this quote from Ken Martin that I saw where he says he took this job to fight Republicans, not Democrats."", ""But, right now, Democrats are fighting with each other in terms of the DNC and this leadership fight.

There used to be a commandment in politics that you don't go after incumbents from your own party. Hogg's view is not that."", 'And, also, he is — David Hogg is remarkably good at getting attention. Ken Martin, that is not his greatest skill set, is getting attention.', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'Amy?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Yes, and I think it speaks to the broader conversation that Democrats are having about, who do we want to be going forward? David Hogg represents the younger generation that has felt incredibly frustrated with Democratic politicians, really going all the way back to 2016, when young voters said, we want Bernie Sanders.', ""They have actually said that in three successive elections. So this is a fight actually Democrats should welcome having right now, because 2028 is when they want — they should want the team to be on the same page.

The last time a US president federalised the national guard against the wishes of a state governor was in 1965, when Lyndon Johnson deployed them to protect civil rights marchers in Alabama.', '“This is the politicisation of the armed forces,” said Maj Gen Paul Eaton. “It casts the military in a terrible light – it’s that man on horseback, who really doesn’t want to be there, out in front of American citizens.”', 'Eaton, who commanded the training of Iraqi troops during the invasion of Iraq, predicted that the LA deployment would lead to the eventual invocation of the Insurrection Act. The 1807 law empowers the president to deploy the full US military against insurrection or armed rebellion.', '“We are headed towards the invocation of the Insurrection Act, which will provide a legal basis for inappropriate activity,” he said.', 'The largely peaceful protests in LA against Trump’s deportation efforts have entered their fourth day. National guard troops began arriving in the city on Sunday, with authorisation to protect federal personnel and buildings but not to engage in law enforcement activities.', 'Trump’s move in the absence of a genuine civil emergency has sent alarm through military circles, which have long prided themselves on being above politics. “This deployment was made counter to what the governor wanted, so it seems like a political forcing – a forced use of the military by Trump because he can,” said a retired senior US army officer who requested anonymity in order to preserve their lifelong non-partisanship.', 'Trump’s memo federalising the national guard for deployment in LA is written in sweeping terms, in effect casting it as a nationwide mobilisation. It says that regular military troops, as well as national guard forces, can be employed by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to protect federal functions anywhere in the country where protests are occurring.', 'Most troublingly, the memo also acts pre-emptively – an action never seen before in the US – authorising the military to be deployed against anticipated protests. It says that troops can be sent to “locations where protest against [federal] functions are occurring, or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments”.', 'On Sunday, Trump signaled that LA was just the start of a much wider deployment. “We’re gonna have troops everywhere,” he said.', 'Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran who is CEO of Vet Voice Foundation which advocates for veterans and military families participating in American democracy, said that the executive order was an invitation to Hegseth to “mobilise as many troops as he wants anywhere within the US. That’s a massive escalation across the country.”', 'Geoffrey DeWeese, a former US army judge advocate who is now a legal director within the National Institute of Military Justice, expressed concern about how the national guard would be used in LA. Under the memo, they can act as protection for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, which potentially means that troops could accompany Ice in immigration deportation raids on homes and businesses.', '“Ice and the national guard are [both] wearing camouflage, carrying automatic weapons – so how do civilians differentiate them? And what message does it send, when all you see are men and women in uniform, with guns and helmets and goggles and maybe gas masks?”', 'The military mobilisation that is now unfolding is far from unexpected. Military and constitutional experts who were convened by the law and policy institute the Brennan Center last summer to wargame what Trump might do in a second administration predicted precisely the current train of events.', 'Trump himself made no attempt to disguise his intentions, repeatedly telling his supporters during last year’s election campaign that if re-elected he would use the military against “the enemy within”.', 'Concerns about the deployment have been heightened by Trump’s previous actions which already pointed towards a politicisation of the armed services. In February he fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and several other top brass without giving just cause.', 'Retired lieutenant general Jeffrey Buchanan, the former commander of the US Army North, said the dismissals also had a politicising effect. “It will lead to Biden’s generals, and Trump’s generals – or generals who are ‘my guys’ and generals who are ‘not my guys’. That erodes confidence in the military, because the people will think that the military are now politicians.”', 'Buchanan added: “The military’s ultimate loyalty is to our constitution, not to a particular leader. We’ve had plenty of tensions between military leaders and presidents in our history, but we’ve always maintained this tradition.”', 'There are also worries about Trump’s upcoming military parade to be staged in Washington DC on 14 June to mark the 250th anniversary of the US army. The date happens to coincide with the president’s 79th birthday.', '“Tanks are rolling into DC, $40m is about to be spent, in a giant function to celebrate one man. That’s deeply unAmerican,” said Vet Voice’s Goldbeck.', 'She added that while the military celebrated its birthdays, street parades were avoided “because that is the action of a dictator. This is all in line with how Trump views the military as a tool at his personal disposal, not as a professional fighting force made up of men and women whose oath is to the constitution.”']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVNRMHR3WTBFNVZGRm5aV2hDVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Why does it work that way? It works that way because the people on the ground know what the situation is,"" Enyart said.', 'By skirting local and state knowledge, Enyart added that ""the President is imposing his political will here, not any kind of local knowledge as to what the situation actually is.""', 'What is the National Guard available to do?', 'Most National Guard troops are trained for natural disasters, not protests, Enyart explains. Missions focused on protest control are unpopular and outside their primary role, adding strain on the Guard.', '""The National Guard has been used for so many things over the last 30 years in Illinois, we were happy to be called out for blizzards, we were happy to be called out for tornadoes. We were happy to be called out for floods... But the guard does not particularly like to be called in to do civil disturbance. Why? we\'re not trained for it. At best, a National Guard soldier gets four hours of training a year to do civil disturbance operations.""', ""What's wrong with using presidential powers to protect federal officers?"", ""While the President technically can protect federal personnel, Enyart says that's not how the Guard is supposed to be used, especially when local police are fully capable."", 'Federal deployment without local consent ignores the chain of accountability built into domestic operations.', '""You do not call the National Guard in until such time as local resources are overwhelmed or no longer able to control the situation, and you have the consent and the request of the local authorities, including the governor. Trump has entirely disregarded this,"" Enyart explained.', 'Is the scale of the protests a valid justification?', 'The administration cited the number of demonstrators as a reason for the deployment, but Enyart questions the threat level. Even if the number of protesters was in the hundreds, he says, that does not justify activating military support in a major city like Los Angeles.', '""Call it 600. Okay, 600 protesters is hardly a revolution. 600 protesters is not going to overwhelm the 8,000 police officers that Los Angeles has as well as all the federal folks who are on the ground,"" Enyart said. He also added that the deployment decision may be more about shifting attention from other issues.', '""The President is doing this to remove the debate from his horrendous tax bill... and taking attention away from the fact that... soybean prices... were about $19.50 a bushel.

The state, counties, and cities of California employ more than 75,000 uniformed law-enforcement personnel with arrest powers. The Los Angeles Police Department alone numbers nearly 9,000 uniformed officers. They can surely handle some dozens of agitators throwing rocks, shooting fireworks, and impeding vehicular traffic.', 'If and when those 75,000 uniformed personnel feel overmatched by the agitators, California can request federal help of its own volition. When California has asked for needed federal help—during the wildfires earlier this year, for example—Trump has begrudged that help and played politics with it.

Immigration Protests Threaten to Boil Over in Los Angeles,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/immigration-protests-threaten-to-boil-over-in-los-angeles,"['On Friday and Saturday, federal officers descended on streets and workplaces across Los Angeles County to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants. There was a large raid at Ambiance Apparel, in the fashion district, and a showdown, thick with tear gas and flash-bang grenades, between protesters and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in Paramount, in southeast L.A. Some immigrants who appeared for check-in appointments at the federal courthouse in Little Tokyo were taken to the basement, then removed, by van, to unknown locations. Homeland Security had recently confirmed that a nine-year-old elementary-school student in Torrance, who’d been detained after a hearing in late May and relocated to a prison in rural Texas, would now be deported. These were not the first immigration-enforcement actions taken by President Trump, who has struggled to fulfill his campaign promise to conduct “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.” But these tactics were, as Oscar Zarate, of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, told me, “lawless, just not normal.” Lawyers were being denied access to detainees; workers were being picked up on the basis of their racial appearance, he said. “There are rules of engagement that are not being followed. It’s incredibly dangerous, not just for immigrants but for citizens.”', 'Los Angeles is, of course, an immigrant town. A third of the county’s residents were born outside the U.S., and more than half speak a language other than English at home. L.A. is a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state: local authorities are not permitted to coöperate with federal immigration enforcers. And so, as word of the recent detentions—described to me by immigrant advocates as “kidnappings” or “abductions” or “disappearances”—spread through text messages and social media, thousands of people showed up to confront an influx of federal law-enforcement personnel from various agencies. Protesters marched and chanted and put their bodies in the way of vehicles and arresting officers; some lit trash on fire, threw rocks, and sprayed graffiti (“Fuck ICE”; “Can’t Stop da Raza!”). Officers responded with drones, batons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. At Ambiance Apparel, they arrested David Huerta, the president of the California branch of the Service Employees International Union. They also blocked a delegation of elected officials and immigration advocates from seeing detainees at the courthouse, a previously routine form of oversight.', 'Federal agents captured some two hundred immigrants in two days, according to the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, which helps to run a hotline and legal-services network. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the arrest of a hundred and eighteen people. Yet Trump apparently could not tolerate—or maybe saw an opportunity in—the friction caused by the community’s efforts to intervene. Late Saturday night, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced that he would deploy two thousand members of the California National Guard to quell what Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, was calling a “violent insurrection.” Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles’s mayor, Karen Bass, objected to the order; they could handle the situation on their own, they said. Nevertheless, three hundred National Guard members were in place by early Sunday, as a number of marches and rallies were held in various parts of the county.', 'I encountered around twenty National Guard members—in camouflage, armed, helmeted, clutching shields—outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A. on Sunday afternoon. Behind them were a half-dozen tactical vehicles. The scene did more to provoke than soothe. Hundreds of activists filled the surrounding streets and sidewalks, demanding an end to raids and deportations. The crowd had not assembled at the instruction of any particular group. They wore Pride rainbows, kaffiyehs, and Mexican and Salvadoran flags. (Miller wrote on X: “Foreign flags flying in American cities to defend the invasion.”) Prisoners in the jail rising above us participated from behind their tiny windows by flicking the lights on and off.', 'A woman who asked to be called Xiomara, because she feared reprisal if she used her real name, and her partner, both social workers and native Angelenos from immigrant families, held signs reading “What if it was your family? You don’t need to be undocumented to stand w/ us” and “BASTA CON LA MIGRA! STOP DEPORTATION.” Xiomara told me that she was close to many people who had voted for Trump and now regretted that decision. “The Administration originally said that deportations were to remove people with a violent criminal history,” she explained. “That’s not what we’ve been seeing. We’ve seen them target kids and people in manual-labor jobs. We’re ripping families apart.” (Homeland Security has claimed that at least some of those arrested are “gang members” and “murderers”—“the worst of the worst.”)', 'Despite the warlike stance of the National Guard, it was the Los Angeles Police Department that did all the work. There looked to be more than a hundred officers from the L.A.P.D., all outfitted in black riot gear. For hours, they positioned themselves as human cordons, shot off tear gas, and gave confusing instructions to protesters. “Move south!” “Leave the area!” “You can’t go there!” “You can’t leave!”A pair of officers shoved me repeatedly and pushed me forward on the sidewalk with their batons. (When I identified as press, one said, “I don’t care.”) Helicopters and surveillance drones flew low. There were L.A.P.D. cars, S.U.V.s (including one that accelerated dangerously through the crowd), trucks, motorcycles, and, later, horses.', 'In the early evening, the confrontation heated up. A message blared from a helicopter, threatening the crowd with arrest and “serious bodily injury” unless the area was cleared within one minute. (Nothing happened after a minute.) Protesters threw stones and plastic water bottles at police cruisers and onto the 101 Freeway, temporarily stopping traffic, and members of the crowd set several driverless Waymo cars on fire, producing a funnel of black smoke. Officers began shooting rubber bullets and corralled the protesters near City Hall. Xiomara witnessed officers on horseback “trampling over people,” she said. Aimee Zavala, a twenty-nine-year-old who left the area around this time, believed that the police response was unmerited. “People are going to be passionate,” she told me, “but I didn’t see any protesters with any weapons. I didn’t see anybody causing physical harm.” On one stretch of sidewalk, I watched a volunteer medic administer gauze and aspirin to three young men with round, bloody wounds. The L.A.P.D. arrested ten protesters, bringing the weekend total to thirty-nine, and used X to declare all of downtown “an UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY.”', 'Not all of the weekend’s demonstrations corresponded to a specific raid or deportation. Some were more elemental: expressions of rage at the Administration’s casual, spectacular cruelty. Just days after Trump’s Inauguration, Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, had taken part in a videotaped series of immigration raids in New York City, also a sanctuary jurisdiction. Now it was Los Angeles’s turn, and it was as if immigrant workers, children, and families had been cast in a film made for Fox News. Local officials weren’t entirely blameless; the chief of the L.A.P.D., Jim McDonnell, pointed out over the weekend that, technically, the department “is not involved in civil immigration enforcement.” The sheriff of L.A. County, Robert Luna, said the same. “But there’s a loophole,” Anthony Bryson, an activist with the group SoCal Uprising, told me. “If they assist with traffic, that’s not immigration enforcement.” The police were present at raids and protests; they willingly backed up their federal peers. “The police were there instigating, creating a militarized boundary,” Bryson went on. “The belief that Los Angeles is a sanctuary city is a myth.” ♦', 'The Vogue model who became a war photographer.', 'Why walking helps us think.', 'Sentenced to life for an accident miles away.', 'Can reading make you happier?', 'The perils of Pearl and Olga.', 'The resurgent appeal of Stevie Nicks.', 'Fiction by Lore Segal: “Ladies’ Lunch”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

Good morning to you, Madam Secretary.', 'SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Good morning. Thank you for inviting me, Margaret.', ""MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are seeing from the President's proclamation that he can federalize- he says, 2000 California National Guard forces for 60 days under Title 10 authorities.  Which units are being deployed? Are they military police, and exactly what are their orders?"", ""SECRETARY NOEM: Yes, President Trump is putting the safety of the communities that are being impacted by these riots and by these protests that have turned violent, and he's putting the safety of our law enforcement officers first. So these 2000 National Guard soldiers that are being engaged today are ones that are specifically trained for this type of crowd situation, where they'll be with the public and be able to provide safety around buildings and to those that are engaged in peaceful protests, and also to our law enforcement officers so they can continue their daily work."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: So our CBS team is reporting that the California National Guard officers are at that Edward Roybal Center in LA. This is a plaza with a federal building, courtrooms are there a processing center, a detention center, a veterans' clinic. Are the soldiers going to remain around the federal building? Are you planning to have them go throughout the city of Los Angeles?"", ""SECRETARY NOEM: I won't speak specifically to all the locations where the national- National Guard soldiers will be deployed to, or where they will be conducting different operations as far as security concerns. They're there at the direction of the President in order to keep peace and allow people to be able to protest, but also to keep law and order. That is incredibly important to the President. He recognizes he was elected to make sure that every single person in this country was treated exactly the same, and that we would enforce the laws. And that is what ICE is doing every day as they're out on our streets and working to go after bad criminals and people that have perpetuated violence on these communities. The gang members we have picked up in LA because of their hard work are horrible people. Assault, drug trafficking, human trafficking. They are now off of those streets, and they are safer because these ICE operations are ongoing. Unfortunately, we've seen some violent protests happen, and that's why these National Guard soldiers are being utilized to help with some security in some areas."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, California's governor doesn't want the federalized system here. He says he's got it under control. There's no shortage of law enforcement, Gavin Newsom said. He's called in California Highway Patrol. He says the Trump administration is seeking a spectacle here. He's saying to protesters, don't get violent, don't engage."", ""SECRETARY NOEM: Well, if he was doing his job, then people wouldn't have gotten hurt the last couple of days. We wouldn't have officers with a shattered wrist from bricks being thrown through their vehicles, their vehicles being burned, flags being burned in the street and Molotov cocktails being thrown. Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions. The President knows that he makes bad decisions, and that's why the President chose the safety of this community over waiting for Governor Newsom to get some sanity. And that's one of the reasons why these National Guard soldiers are being federalized so they can use their special skill set to keep peace. We're not going to let a repeat of 2020 happen. And if you remember, it all happened in Tim Walz's state in Minneapolis, [AUDIO CUTS OUT] neighboring state and a governor at the time. And Governor Tim Walz made very bad decisions and then tried to get the rest of us governors to send our National Guard in to bail him out when he let his city burn for days on end. We--"", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Well he called the National Guard two days after the protests, but that was a point of contention, I know, in hindsight. President Trump--', ""SECRETARY NOEM:  [AUDIO CUTS OUT] --in California won't happen again."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said masks will not be allowed to be worn at protests. Who's going to enforce that and how? And how can you justify it when law enforcement officials have their faces covered?"", ""SECRETARY NOEM: You know what I would say is that the law is going to be enforced, and that I- what the laws are in this country is what we are doing, and our ICE officers and our law enforcement officers out there that are in these situations where people have questioned why they have their faces covered. It's for the safety of those individuals or the work that they're doing as far as protecting their identity so they can continue to do investigative work, so."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you tasking the National Guard soldiers with removing masks from protesters? I mean, are you trying to use them in that way?', ""SECRETARY NOEM: National Guard soldiers are there to provide security for operations and to make sure that we have peaceful protests. So that's what their work is, and I won't get more specific on that, just because we never do when it comes to law enforcement operations, we're doing the same standard procedures we always do and have for years in this country with our National Guard and with our- you know, law enforcement folks that are on the ground working with these communities."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Defense Secretary also tweeted last night that he put active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton on high alert. We know, since you mentioned 2020 that President Trump, during those Black Lives Matter protests at the time, had wanted to use active-duty U.S. troops on the streets of a major city. The 82nd Airborne at the time was called up. They were not sent into the streets. What exactly do you set as Homeland Security Secretary as your benchmark for when you would counsel the President of the United States to send active duty troops in to police a domestic disturbance?', ""SECRETARY NOEM: Well, my hope is always that we work with local leaders that would do their jobs. And that is what has failed in LA, is that the mayor has refused to recognize the dangerous situation that she's perpetuating, as well as the governor. When we ask for backup in a situation, LAPD has waited hours to respond, and they've waited until we have an officer in a dangerous situation, until they come in and help us bring peace. Oftentimes, in these cities, you have good leaders that help give back up to other law enforcement officers, but you have politicians who won't give that kind of resource when it's needed. Unfortunately, waiting several hours for LAPD to show up or telling them- them telling us that they're not going to back us up until they have an officer in a dangerous situation is something that just isn't workable when you have violent protests going on, so."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S.--', ""SECRETARY NOEM: --work better with us, but that's one of the reasons that you've seen the National Guard come in and help us with those security operations."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the US Attorney in LA told CBS that LAPD did help. LAPD, does  not--', ""SECRETARY NOEM: That's what stood out to me, Margaret, is hours later they- they waited until we had officers in dangerous situations, then they responded. Now, if that was my city and I was the mayor, I would be sending law enforcement in there to back up other law enforcement officers. That's what America's about is- is that we have rules and we have laws. If you don't like the laws, go to Congress and change them. Someone should go to Congress and say, change the laws. If we don't like what's happening in this country, do that instead of throwing rocks and throwing Molotov cocktails and instead of attacking law enforcement officers. We're just not going to do that anymore. This President cares deeply about family members that want to live in their communities and be safe."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: Back to the question, though, of active-duty troops, different from the National Guard, what is your personal counsel here to the President? Because it's you, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, who are going to have a lot of responsibility here in implementing some of this call to do this?"", ""SECRETARY NOEM: Well, let me be clear about something, ICE and Homeland Security are running these operations right now, and the advice and counsel of the Attorney General, the Department of Defense are extremely important to the President of the United States, and we never discuss our personal conversations and advice to the President of the United States. He makes the decisions he is the President that sits in that seat, and we are all very proud to work for him. So I'm grateful for the leadership- leadership of Pete Hegseth and- and Pam Bondi and I get the chance to work with them, and as ICE [AUDIO CUTS OUT] and does their job today, we're thankful to have the partnership and the leadership of President Trump."", 'MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some Republican senators, like Senator Lankford has- have said active-duty Marines are not going to be put into local law enforcement. So there are Republican lawmakers questioning this. To the question about where we are seeing the National Guard troops centered around this Roybal center, CBS is reporting undocumented immigrants attending their ICE check-ins were being detained and held overnight in the basement of that building. And there were lawyers for some of those detainees claiming it was illegal because the migrants were held in makeshift facilities with limited access to food and water. That was one of the sources of the protest. Can you vouch for these facilities? And do you understand what some of these protesters are concerned about?', ""SECRETARY NOEM: Well these protests started long before we ended up in the situations that we saw when we were trying to secure these individuals, and the law enforcement officers involved. What I would say is- is getting into individuals in and out of those facilities was extremely challenging when the violence broke out and when things were being thrown at vehicles, and people were rocking vehicles and shaking them, trying to break into them. In fact, we had to send a swift response team in to get a female officer out of her vehicle safely- when those situations. So we are following all the laws and procedures as we always do. But when you have violence like that, the safety of everybody involved is incredibly important, and we'll make sure that we get people through them without injury as best to our ability."", ""MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Noem, we're going to have to leave that there. Thank you for your time this morning, and we apologize to our viewers about any audio drops you may have heard there. I heard a few myself. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute.

The federal funding that supports local stations and public media is under threat.', '', 'Geoff Bennett', 'Ryan Connelly Holmes', 'Leave your feedback', ""To discuss President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in California, Geoff Bennett spoke with Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. She’s now at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government."", 'Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.', 'Geoff Bennett:', ""For a closer look, we're joined now by Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. She's now at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government."", ""Juliette, it's great to have you here."", ""So, historically, presidents, as we just heard, they federalized the National Guard at a governor's request during a time of crisis, like after Hurricane Katrina, or to enforce court orders, as was the case in Little Rock back in 1957 to enforce integration."", ""What happened over the weekend is without precedent, the president deploying the Guard over the governor's objection. What are the implications?"", ""Juliette Kayyem, Former U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary: Well, they are huge. I mean, there's really no — there's not only no precedent to this. There's no sort of check on it. We don't know, if this is the standard if what happened in L.A. is the standard now for federalizing the National Guard and deployment of active military."", ""The Trump administration has so lowered the floor and the distinction between civil and military actions, that they appear now to be one and the same. It's important to remember there's two distinct issues here, and I'm not even going to talk about immigration."", 'The first is, what are the standards for deployment of a federalized National Guard? To just put it in context, the last time this was done, as you said, the governors, both — in both instances, the governors wanted it — was 1992, the L.A. riots. By then, by the time that they were called, over 60 people had died, had been killed in a city that was literally on fire everywhere throughout Los Angeles.', ""And then again in 2005, with Hurricane Katrina response, by then 1,400 Americans were dead. There is protests. There is violent protests in L.A. There are cars on fire. There's name-calling. There's agitation. But there is nothing that satisfies the standards that we saw in '92 and 2005."", ""The second thing I want to say is the deployment of active military into a very complicated web of first responders who are training and working together all the time is not always beneficial. And there's a lot of challenges in terms of the introduction of a militarized force into civilian law enforcement, firefighters, emergency managers. And in the past, it has not worked very well."", 'Geoff Bennett:', 'I want to ask you more about the Marine deployment in a moment.', ""But, first, for the National Guard, practically, does the National Guard operate differently, whether it's under state or federal leadership?"", 'Juliette Kayyem:', 'Yes.', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'I mean, what does that mean for command and control?', 'Juliette Kayyem:', 'Yes, so National Guard, just think of it as dual-hatted.', ""So, the same person — I'm in the National Guard. So, under state National Guard, I report to my governor. The president, as he did on Saturday, then could federalize me, essentially under Title 10. I now report to any command that president is going to give me, regardless of what I have been trained to, my understanding of the community, my integration into the community."", ""That's the beauty of state National Guards is that they're us. I mean, they're here. They're not off at some camp in another state. They understand the communities. They understand the geography."", ""So, for example, in 1992 with the L.A. riots, the state National Guard were also deployed. That was viewed as pretty successful, although delayed and complicated. They did things like help with traffic control, protect buildings, as we're talking about, support law enforcement in terms of just giving them sort of a little bit of bandwidth, given where the riots were. They helped protect shopping malls."", ""That's the kind of thing that you want your sort of — your local military asset to do under the president. They can do almost anything under Title 10, except, under the Posse Comitatus act, they cannot serve in a law enforcement function. In other words, ICE would still need to come in and deport people."", ""But unless you have trained for that, unless you know what the rules of engagement are, I wouldn't have a lot of confidence in the military understanding that distinction under this president."", 'Geoff Bennett:', ""Well, late today, we learned that 700 Marines in California from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at Twentynine Palms, they have been ordered to assist in Los Angeles. They're expected to arrive within 24 hours."", 'The big question now, among many, is whether President Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act, which would give these troops the ability to directly participate in civil law enforcement.', 'Juliette Kayyem:', 'Yes.', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'And this was the thing, Juliette, as you well know, that many Trump officials during the first term were pushing back against because it sets up potentially volatile interactions between U.S. troops and civilians on U.S. soil.', 'What questions does this raise?', 'Juliette Kayyem:', ""That's right."", ""They also — U.S. troops against first responders. I mean, look, if people want to complain about the rioters or the paid rioters or the outside agitators, sure, you now — we will now have active military on the streets with a mission we don't know, under legal authority that has not yet been invoked yet, with no training, no communication capacity with the other first responders, and no clear chain of command that integrates into what's already been built."", ""And let's just — I want to say this again, and out in the street operationally not necessary. I mean, this is — we're not at the kind of crisis that the president and Secretary Hegseth and Homan, who talked about essentially mean language towards ICE officials."", ""So this is a second shoe to drop within 48 hours. And I will say we have never seen this before. I don't care what you think about immigration or immigration enforcement.

Trump Should Crush the L.A. Riots—with a Subtle Hand,https://www.city-journal.org/article/los-angeles-riots-trump-deportation-national-guard-immigration,"['How the president can restore order and win the war for visual symbolism', 'Los Angeles is burning. Earlier this year, seasonal fires ripped through the Southern California city, but now, the fires are entirely manmade. In response to the Trump administration’s deportation policy, left-wing activists and opportunistic rioters have taken to the streets to vandalize property, incinerate automobiles, and assault law enforcement officers. The images emerging from the city are shocking: thugs hurling rocks from an overpass onto police; men spinning motorcycles around burning debris; a masked, shirtless rioter waving a Mexican flag atop a burned-out autonomous car.', 'In short, the Left is giving President Trump all the visual symbolism he needs to advance his immigration agenda. Most Americans see chaos in the name of a foreign flag and find it repellent. Though Trump’s language about a migrant “invasion” has sometimes been dismissed as hyperbolic, it seems that the Left is intent on turning it into a material reality.', 'Finally, a reason to check your email.', 'Sign up for our free newsletter today.', 'The question: How should the president respond? Many on the right may feel an instinctual reaction to “send in the troops.” While this concern for law and order is natural and merited, it must be pursued in a way that maximizes the chance for success and minimizes the chance for blowback. As the president considers his options, he might keep in mind a number of strategic points that, if implemented, will increase his leverage in the fight for large-scale deportations.', 'The administration must deny the Left a strong visual counterargument. It’s easy to see how scenes of militarization, abuse of demonstrators, or a violent death could reverse public sympathies and present the administration as abusing its authority. The language of politics is visual—and therefore emotional, which means that a single mistake can reverse the flow of opinion and imperil the president’s immigration agenda. Left-wing tacticians have trained their foot soldiers to bait law enforcement into confrontation and to play victim for the press, to great effect.', 'To prevent this scenario, Trump has a number of strategic options available to him. First, rather than sending in more troops to stop the fires, the president might be better advised to hold off. Right now, California governor Gavin Newsom has sided with the demonstrators, but if the riots spread further, this stance will cost him in public opinion, and eventually, he will have to assume the mantle of authority. The public will expect Newsom to restore order, and he’ll have to incur the risk of using force.', 'Second, the president should pressure local leaders to buy in to the task of quelling the riots. He could wait for Governor Newsom to request the National Guard or appear at a press conference with Los Angeles County officials, bringing state Democrats into the risk-reward calculus and creating the option for the president to shift the blame in the future if they fail to respond effectively. California Democrats are anticipating that Trump will assume all the authority and, therefore, relieve them of any responsibility. He should resist the temptation to be the only player on the field with skin in the game.', 'Third, the president should direct federal agencies to create a hard-soft, or visible-invisible, approach to riot control. In public, the National Guard should mobilize with enough manpower to smother the protests and avoid protracted conflict or hand-to-hand combat, which carries with it the highest level of risk. At the same time, as we saw demonstrated in Portland, Oregon, during the George Floyd riots, the agencies should dispatch unmarked vans to follow key agitators and snatch them from the streets while the media are not looking. The most effective riot control is to take movement leaders off the field, infiltrate their networks, disrupt the flow of funding, and roll them up in federal investigations. Denying the Left trained protest leaders now will create a strong precedent for the rest of the president’s term.', 'President Trump has often tweeted “law and order” in all capital letters. This is a powerful formulation—half a century ago, it won Richard Nixon a landslide reelection—but especially in today’s media environment, it must be carried out subtly and with an eye toward visual language. To reestablish order on the streets but lose the war for public opinion would constitute an empty victory and a real danger to the president’s agenda. The desire to quell rioting is a noble one, but the president should remember that, ultimately, California is responsible for California’s streets.', 'The president’s approach to the rioting and lawlessness should be guided by a higher goal: enacting his immigration agenda. The mayhem in downtown L.A. represents his first real test in that effort.', 'Christopher F. Rufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a contributing editor of City Journal, and the author of America’s Cultural Revolution.', 'Photo: Carlin Stiehl / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images', 'City Journal is a publication of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research (MI), a leading free-market think tank.

Gavin Newsom, the president’s frequent nemesis.', 'Newsom accused the president of speaking like an “authoritarian,” and Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, have seized the moment to ridicule Newsom’s leadership and drag him into a debate over immigration, including with a threat to arrest the California governor. On Monday, Trump ordered about 700 marines to LA to support the National Guard.', '', 'To get a sense of what’s really happening on the ground in California, and in Washington, we gathered some of our experts from the newsroom.', '', 'POLITICO’s Los Angeles-based senior politics writer Melanie Mason, national political reporter Holly Otterbein, senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein, and White House and foreign affairs correspondent Eli Stokols discussed the political and legal significance of the move, how the situation is playing politically for Newsom and where they predict this intensifying showdown will go from here.', '', 'This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.', 'OUR PANELISTS', 'California politics editor, POLITICO', 'Senior politics reporter, California, POLITICO', 'White House and foreign affairs correspondent, POLITICO', 'National political reporter, POLITICO', 'Senior legal affairs reporter, POLITICO', 'Trump has long talked about cracking down on protests and sending in troops if need be. But the deployment of the National Guard without that governor’s approval is an extraordinary measure. How surprised should we be?', 'Eli Stokols: Not very? Immigration is the president’s primary issue and he and his aides really believe they have a mandate on this. And by now, we’ve also seen them pushing up on the limits of the law, seemingly eager to force these confrontations in the courts.', 'Holly Otterbein: I agree with Eli. In his first term, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests over George Floyd’s death. He ultimately didn’t go through with it after opposition from his then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper. This time around, there are few, if any, cabinet members willing to push back on him.', 'Josh Gerstein: To me, this hearkens back to two previous events from Trump’s last term, the long-running protests in Portland, Oregon and elsewhere in 2020 and how Trump leaned heavily on his then-aides like Attorney General Bill Barr to respond very aggressively. This is the kind of showdown Trump has long been primed for, and he is almost always going to opt for a response that looks “tough.” The obvious exception: Jan. 6, 2021, when he basically sat on his hands as police did battle with thousands of people who stormed the Capitol in an attempt to keep him in power.', 'Melanie, you got a call from Newsom this morning — what did he have to say?', 'Melanie Mason: He didn’t mince words — especially about Trump’s remarks Monday morning that he thinks Newsom should be arrested. Newsom told me such sentiments were “the words of an authoritarian” and warned it would have a chilling effect on any political opposition to Trump. Not for nothing, Newsom also sent out an email on his political mailing list blasting out Trump’s comments, so he clearly has some interest in making sure that the back-and-forth is getting a lot of eyeballs. Overall, he pushed back strongly on Trump’s allegation that he needed to send in the National Guard to quell an out-of-control riot; rather, he said, it was Trump’s intervention that caused this escalation.', 'Compared to the demonstrations we saw in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, the protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids have been relatively small in scale. How much do you think Trump’s involvement could change that?', 'Stokols: It’s very possible that Trump’s involvement galvanizes more people and results in a much larger protest. Which in a strange way would give them more of a pretext, at least in their view, to bring in more federal forces. So, there is something to that idea that they are stoking this, and it becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy.', 'Gerstein: That Trump is fueling the flames is the No. 1 talking point right now of Gov. Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who is filing a lawsuit against Trump’s activation of the National Guard. They claim that the most serious violence last night —including the visually dramatic burning of several Waymo cars — is the product of Trump’s decision to get involved. Seems impossible we will ever know for sure.', 'Mason: We’ll see if things flare up again tonight, but I should note that things feel far less combustible here than they did in 2020. The protests have been isolated to downtown, as opposed to five years ago, when we saw demonstrations in all parts of the city. Also, the actual federal presence on the ground at this point is relatively minor: Newsom said that only 300 National Guard troops were actually deployed. The vast majority of crowd control was done by local law enforcement. But to Eli’s point, the question is whether the specter of federal involvement continues to bring out larger crowds, which would then probably result in more troops deployed.', 'Los Angeles is massive. And the reality is most Angelenos are miles and miles from the action. How has social media shaped national perceptions of the size and scope of the protests and the extent of destruction and violence?', 'Stokols: It seems clear that the White House is spreading this on social media in hopes that the rest of the country sees the chaos he is claiming and agrees that it justifies this response.', 'Gerstein: Social media clearly allows people to wallow in the scenes they find most disturbing, but ordinary media does a plenty good job of showcasing violence and conflict. No one is going to put a photo on the front page of a Waymo car not being burned.', 'Mason: Anecdotally, I got far more text messages from friends outside of LA concerned about what’s going on than from friends and family in LA having any personal encounter with the unrest.', 'Stokols: Right, but the actual reality for Angelenos is immaterial to Trump. He’s telling a much bigger story, and it’s the same one he’s been telling since 2015.', 'Otterbein: The Trump administration is also getting the help of the man with the biggest social media megaphone in the world, Elon Musk, in sharing images and stories of the worst of the destruction in LA.', 'Eli, the National Guard deployment on Saturday abruptly changed the news cycle from headlines on the megabill, the see-sawing tariffs and the Elon Musk breakup — was this intentional?', 'Stokols: To a degree, yes. With something like this, the president and his aides are keenly aware of how the story will detonate in the press. And they obviously knew what had been dominating the news up to this point. And Trump, who often casually reveals the strategy behind a lot of what he’s doing, just opened a roundtable event by mentioning the situation in LA and placing it in the context of several other things people have been hearing about, “some good, some not so good,” or some such description.', 'Border Czar Tom Homan has said he’d arrest anyone, including elected officials, who interfere with federal law enforcement. Josh, do you think he’s bluffing, and if not, would such a move succeed with a judge or jury?', 'Gerstein: I tend to think it is bluster. One can’t dismiss it out of hand, of course, given the arrests in recent weeks of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) stemming from the incident at an immigration detention facility in New Jersey. There are clearly those in the administration that like the optics of such fights. But unless Newsom actually went to the scene of a protest, I don’t think the feds would go for this. I think all these sorts of cases — including the charges brought against people involved in demonstrations and standoffs in LA over the weekend — will be tough to sell to urban juries, if they ever get that far.', 'Speaking of Newsom, are there any hopes that he and Trump will return to the fragile truce we saw earlier in the year when the two hugged on the tarmac in Los Angeles? Eli, do you think Trump wants that? Does Newsom want that, Melanie?', '', 'Stokols: It does not seem that Trump wants that at the moment, no. Getting along publicly on a trip about disaster relief should never have been seen as predictive of the broader relationship.', '', 'Mason: Newsom spoke to the president on Friday night, during which the governor says the topic of deploying the National Guard never came up. Which I think is why Newsom has been coming in so hot in his public comments these last few days.', '', 'The jaded political reporter in me says that Newsom doesn’t want a detente either. These events have thrust him back into the national spotlight and almost certainly will juice the 2028 presidential rumors and that’s on balance, a good thing for him. But Newsom is also looking at this through the lens of a governor who has roughly 18 months left in office where he’s at the mercy of a federal government that can do real harm to his state. He’s got LA wildfire recovery to think of, California’s precarious budget picture, any number of levers that Trump can pull that can inflict real pain here.', '', 'Stokols: Yes, this is doing a lot more for his 2028 viability with Democrats than hosting Steve Bannon on his podcast was ever going to.', '', 'You both anticipated my next question, for Melanie and Holly: Gavin Newsom had somewhat faded from the national spotlight in recent weeks. How is this situation playing out for him politically?', '', 'Mason: It’s an interesting moment for him because we’ve lately seen Newsom tack to the center on a number of issues — trans students playing in girls’ sports being the most obvious example — and get blowback from the party because of it. Now he’s back in his comfort zone, going toe-to-toe with Trump. It’s probably going to re-energize Democratic base voters who may have been less than thrilled with his recent moderate positioning.', '', 'Otterbein: Democratic voters want their leaders to put up a fight against Trump. Newsom telling Trump’s border czar to “arrest me — let’s go” gives the base exactly the conflict that it’s craving. At the same time, Newsom had Bannon and Charlie Kirk on his podcast for a reason, presumably — to moderate his image as a liberal governor from California, possibly ahead of a 2028 run. And any scenes out of LA that allow Republicans to make the argument that he isn’t capably managing the situation could make it harder for him to moderate his image.', '', 'Holly, how are other Democrats approaching the episode so far, and what is their political calculation?', '', 'Otterbein: On the most basic level, the situation in LA means Democrats have to talk about illegal immigration, and that is not something they want to be talking about. They’d rather be focusing on Medicaid cuts, the Musk-Trump divorce, tariffs or the economy. That’s because Trump’s deportation policy is popular. A CBS poll conducted before the LA protests and raids found 54 percent of Americans approved of the president’s deportation program, while 46 percent disapproved.', '', 'So Democrats are trying to change the subject back to more favorable terrain for them. As one moderate Democratic strategist put it to me, “We need to make sure the fact that he wants to distract from how he’s screwing the middle class over economically is mentioned whenever we respond” to LA. And some elected officials seem to be doing just that. Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego tweeted, “It’s Medicaid Monday, don’t let Trump distract you from what he is trying to do. Cut millions from Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the rich.”', 'Josh, you referenced the lawsuit California filed this morning to challenge the deployment. Does the state have a real chance of succeeding?', '', 'Gerstein: It seems to me like an uphill battle. There are two basic arguments: One is that the law Trump invoked requires him to consult with or get the permission of the state governor and the other is that there is no invasion, rebellion, danger of a rebellion or difficulty carrying out federal law that merits getting military troops involved.', '', 'The first part is a debatable interpretation of the language in the law, which just says the activation order has to be “issued through” the governor. It doesn’t actually say the governor has to concur or even be consulted. The second condition about the rebellion or danger thereof seems pretty subjective, so I have doubts that most judges would substitute their judgment for the president’s on that front. That doesn’t mean California might not win a round or two as this goes up the chain. And maybe the situation settles down and the legal dispute is mooted out.', '', 'Last question, for everybody: Any predictions on how this all ends?', '', 'Gerstein: I think the threats from Trump and the chaotic scenes from the weekend will prompt local law enforcement to take a harder line against violent protesters and those setting fires and the like, which may make the military troops seem superfluous. I am concerned, though, that we will continue to see less violent, less organized standoffs between members of the public and ICE as ICE tries to make arrests and that some of these confrontations could turn deadly, especially as Trump turns to forces that don’t normally have experience with policing American crowds or streets.', '', 'Mason: I agree with Josh. Even if we don’t see large demonstrations like we saw on Sunday, so long as there are continued ICE raids at workplaces or Home Depots or other public locations, there will continue to be opportunities for clashes that could have serious consequences. Meanwhile, I’ll be watching for the chilling effect this has on day-to-day life in Los Angeles. This is a region where immigrants — legal and otherwise — are deeply embedded into the fabric, and if people aren’t going to work or out in public for fear of being profiled or being detained, those effects could swiftly ripple through this city.', '', 'Stokols: Trump was just asked about this at the White House roundtable event, and he referenced having been too “nice” to the George Floyd protesters and “politically correct” in other similar situations. As I think Holly mentioned above, this second term so far has been largely about doing the things he thought about but stopped short of doing in his first term. Imposing tariffs was another thing where he was just going to push the button no matter what. But then he walked a lot of those back and it’s uncertain where it will end. With this, I think there’s a chance the situation in Los Angeles is resolved soon-ish but that ICE will continue to carry out these targeted raids. And if and when those spark bigger confrontations or demonstrations, I’d expect the president to lean into them, especially in blue states where he sees a useful foil.', '', 'Otterbein: Trump has a habit of doing headline-grabbing things and then un-doing them. See: tariffs. That’s one possibility. Another is that Trump leans into ICE raids and confrontations over them, whether in LA or elsewhere, more and more, with the knowledge that immigration is his biggest political strength. One thing I’ll be watching is whether ICE continues to target, say, day laborers at Home Depot, and if that changes Americans’ attitudes toward Trump’s deportation program. Right now, a majority of Americans appear to view his administration as focusing on dangerous criminals, even if that isn’t entirely accurate.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVNRMHR3WTBFNVZGRm5aV2hDVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

The arrests were carried out without judicial warrants, according to multiple legal observers and confirmed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).', 'The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which did not take part in the raids, was called in to quell ensuing protests.', 'The raids were part of a broader initiative under the Trump administration’s intensified immigration policies.', '', '', '', 'The raids focused on several locations in downtown LA and its immediate surroundings. These spots are known to have significant migrant populations and labour-intensive industries.', 'Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), which covers California – home to the US’s largest population of undocumented people – said advocates had recorded enforcement activity at seven sites. This included two Home Depot stores in the Westlake District of Los Angeles, a doughnut shop and the clothing wholesaler, Ambiance Apparel in the Fashion District of downtown Los Angeles.', 'Other locations in which raids were carried out included day labour centres and one other Ambiance facility near 15th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in south Los Angeles.', 'ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) reported the “administrative arrest” of 44 individuals for immigration-related offences.', 'An administrative arrest, unlike a criminal arrest, refers to detention for civil immigration violations such as overstaying a visa or lacking legal status, and does not require criminal charges. These arrests can result in detention, deportation, temporary re-entry bans and denial of future immigration requests.', 'Advocates believe the number of arrests made was higher, however. Caleb Soto, of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, told Al Jazeera that between 70 and 80 people had been detained, but only three lawyers have been allowed access to the detention centre where they were being held to provide legal advice.', 'Soto added that members of the community had effectively been “kidnapped” as officials, wearing masks had not shown warrants or any form of documentation when carrying out arrests.', 'Additionally, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal agents during the raids. Huerta was reportedly injured during the arrest and received medical treatment at Los Angeles General Medical Center before being taken into custody.', 'What sets these raids apart from typical civil enforcement actions was their military-style execution, experts say.', 'According to witnesses, legal observers and advocacy groups, federal agents involved in the operations were heavily armed and dressed in tactical gear, with some wearing camouflage and carrying rifles.', 'Agents arrived in unmarked black SUVs and armoured vehicles and, at certain points, sealed off entire streets around targeted buildings. Drones were reportedly used for surveillance in some areas and access to sites was blocked off with yellow tape, similar to measures which would be taken during a high-threat counterterrorism or drug bust operation.', 'The ACLU described the show of force as an “oppressive and vile paramilitary operation”. Civil liberties groups said the tactics used had created panic in local communities and may have violated protocols for civil immigration enforcement.', '', '', '', 'As news of the raids spread via social media and through immigrant advocacy networks, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Edward R Roybal Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, where detainees were being processed.', 'Demonstrators blocked entrances and exits to the building, chanted slogans and demanded the release of those arrested. Some spray-painted anti-ICE slogans on the building’s exterior walls. Several protesters attempted to physically stop ICE vehicles, leading to confrontations with law enforcement.', 'LAPD officers issued dispersal orders and warned protesters that they would be subject to arrest if they remained in the area. To enforce the order, officers in riot gear deployed tear gas, pepper spray and “less-lethal munitions”, including firing rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. A citywide tactical alert was also issued, requiring all LAPD officers to remain on duty.', 'Shortly after 7pm on Friday [02:00 GMT Saturday], the LAPD declared the protests to be an “unlawful assembly”, meaning that those who failed to leave the area could be subject to arrest. The declaration appeared to remain in effect until the crowd dispersed later that evening, though no formal end time was publicly announced.', 'US media outlets and rights groups reported that hundreds of detainees, including children, were held overnight in the basement of the federal building without access to beds, blankets or adequate food and water.', 'However, an ICE spokesperson told CBS News that the agency “categorically refutes the assertions made by immigration activists in Los Angeles”, stating that it takes its mandate to care for people in custody “seriously”.', 'The status of all individuals detained remains unclear.

Trump’s unprecedented militarization in L.A. is making things worse,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-los-angeles-ice-protests-military-national-guard-rcna211931,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'President Donald Trump’s unilateral actions deploying at least 2,000 National Guard members to downtown Los Angeles this weekend — contrary to the stated desire of California Gov. Gavin Newsom — has appropriately raised serious concerns regarding federalism, authoritarianism and politicization of our armed forces. While the use of the U.S. military on American streets isn’t new, from disaster response following Hurricane Katrina to helping Los Angeles quell its 1992 riots, Trump’s militarization of the already tense situation in Los Angeles is unprecedented. Moreover, the move threatens to exacerbate tensions instead of lessen them.', 'Trump’s militarization of the already tense situation in Los Angeles is unprecedented.', 'Trump’s order is unlike other domestic uses of the military because the American norm revolves around states. States are primarily responsible for the safety of their city streets, with governors requesting help from the federal government only when needed. During one of the worst U.S. civil disturbances outside the Civil War, for example, then-California Gov. Pete Wilson asked President H.W. Bush for federal military assistance during the 1992 L.A. riots.', 'Presidents have only rarely bypassed governors and, without their consent, commanded federal military assets (both active duty military and federalized National Guard units) to deal with domestic unrest, largely during the Civil Rights Movement (the last time governors were cut out of the picture was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized members of the National Guard to protect civil rights protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery).', 'In stark contrast, instead of protecting protestors, Trump federalized the National Guard this past weekend without Newsom’s support, which risks squashing First Amendment-protected protests against his administration’s draconian immigration dragnet, thereby throwing gasoline on an already volatile situation. Trump claimed this was necessary to protect federal agents and property from a “rebellion” in Los Angeles, even though Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass were effectively using the Los Angeles Police Department, state Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department at the time to deal with sporadic violence associated with what began as largely peaceful protests.', 'Critically, from the start of these protests Newsom had the authority to deploy his own California National Guard units to assist local L.A. law enforcement personnel if needed; like all governors, he could specifically order members of his National Guard to engage in policing, including arrests, searches and seizures. This powerful domestic law enforcement authority of National Guard units working for their governor is critically important and represents a huge distinction between guard and active duty units.', 'Unlike in the active duty military, domestic law enforcement is a traditional role for states’ National Guard units. As citizen soldiers tracing their roots to state militias at the time of the Revolutionary War, members of the National Guard working for their governor are not seen as the same threat to democracy that federal troops have been. The National Guard’s role in the U.S. democratic schema is unique; guard units across the country work first and foremost for their governors in both domestic law enforcement and disaster response capacities. The president can also call them up to federal service, under the Pentagon’s command and control, to fight foreign wars, to assist in repelling invasion or rebellion, and to help execute federal law. Traditionally, when used domestically, National Guard units typically continue to fall under the command and control of their governor (or are federalized only at the request of the affected governor), except in the very rare cases not seen since the 1960s, like during the desegregation of the high school in Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'This distinction between the National Guard, who work primarily for their state governors, and the active duty military and reserves is a critical one and reveals a historic mistrust of federal troops (as opposed to the National Guard) being used on American streets. Alexander Hamilton expressed one of our Founding Father’s greatest fears — that the U.S. military, while necessary for a strong union, could be used by a tyrannical president against “we the people,” thereby replacing democratic power with authoritarian rule. This fear focused on the active duty military, not the militias (today’s guard) embedded day in and day out in their towns and villages.', 'Alexander Hamilton expressed one of our Founding Father’s greatest fears — that the U.S. military, while necessary for a strong union, could be used by a tyrannical president against “we the people.""', 'This deep American aversion to federal troops being deployed on our city streets is legally manifested in the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits active-duty military — and National Guard units when working for the president, therefore indistinguishable from active duty troops — from law enforcement (policing) duties, unless expressly authorized by other law. Traditionally, that exception has been the use of another venerable federal law — the Insurrection Act.', 'Notably, while Trump has lawfully federalized National Guard troops under a separate statute that allows him to do so in case of invasion or rebellion or to execute federal laws — one that seemingly vests in him the discretion to decide when such rebellion is present or law execution is needed — he has not concomitantly invoked the Insurrection Act. Meaning the California National Guard troops that the governor could have deployed to engage in policing in Los Angeles cannot now legally engage in such activities, because they work for the president and are barred from law enforcement until the Insurrection Act is invoked.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Given the lack of Insurrection Act invocation, it’s no wonder the president’s order stresses that the National Guard will engage in protective activities only, with no mention of law enforcement. Yet protective functions could easily transform into the need to engage in law enforcement. By inflaming tensions by sending in federal troops (the guard units deployed to L.A. are indistinguishable from active duty troops now that they are federalized, though far better trained in law enforcement than active duty units), Trump may have created the need to invoke the Insurrection Act, thus allowing him to order not only the National Guard, but also active duty troops to police the streets of Los Angeles.', 'Trump’s order to federalize the California National Guard seems lawful under the broad discretion of the statute used (though it requires that orders to federalize flow through the governor, which the Trump administration has largely ignored). Yet Trump’s actions — including a possible Insurrection Act invocation — run contrary to the historical use of these powers. They instead represent not only a dangerous escalation for those on the ground, but a dangerous precedent in the abuse of the armed forces for political ends, and a dangerous move for those on the streets of Los Angeles.', 'Rachel E.
