Too Big to Be Lawful: A Federal Court Halts Mass Layoffs Across the Civil Service,https://www.justsecurity.org/114005/federal-court-halts-mass-layoffs-civil-service/,"['This piece is part of the Collection: Just Security’s Coverage of the Trump Administration’s Executive Actions', 'On May 22, a federal judge in the Northern District of California issued a sweeping preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from moving forward with large-scale layoffs and agency reorganizations ordered under Executive Order 14210. That order, signed by President Donald Trump in February, directed agencies to submit aggressive “Reduction in Force and Reorganization Plans” — with cuts targeted at offices not “mandated by statute.”', 'But in American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) v. Trump, the court found these sweeping actions went far beyond ordinary workforce adjustments. Instead, the court held, they amounted to a coordinated plan — executed through the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) — to eliminate or defund entire agency functions without congressional approval or public input.', 'The court called the administration’s defense a “fig leaf of agency discretion” and emphasized that “the President may not lawfully do by coordinated executive fiat what Congress has repeatedly declined to allow by statute.”', 'The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of labor unions, non-profits, and local governments affected by the planned cuts. The court’s order highlighted several striking facts:', 'All of these actions and others followed the centralized guidance of EO 14210 and implementing memos from OMB. The court found this centralization was not incidental — it was the point.', 'Reduction in Force (RIF) and Reorganization Plans were not agency-initiated plans developed independently. Rather, agencies were instructed to craft proposals responsive to uniform directives about which types of positions should be eliminated. These plans were then funneled through OMB and OPM, giving rise to a clear pattern: the executive branch was using administrative means to reorganize at a scale not allowed without authorization from Congress.', 'The court found that the executive branch was overstepping constitutional boundaries by attempting to restructure the federal government without legislation. In the past, presidents have asked Congress to authorize reorganization authority. This time, the administration attempted to proceed unilaterally — by directing each agency to submit a RIF plan aligned with centralized priorities.', 'The court also found that these actions likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Agencies failed to engage in required notice-and-comment rulemaking, and their decisions appeared arbitrary and capricious — especially where staffing cuts would make it impossible to perform core statutory functions.', 'For example, eliminating key processing and outreach staff in programs like Head Start and Social Security undermines the very mandates Congress assigned to those agencies. The court emphasized that agencies do not have the discretion to restructure themselves in ways that make legal compliance impossible. Nor can the executive branch, acting through OMB or OPM, issue binding requirements that amount to legislative rules without public input.', 'This dispute is truly about whether the president can rewrite the structure of federal agencies by pressuring them to gut staff, close offices, and abandon statutory mandates. And while the government claimed these were agency-led choices, the evidence showed centralized planning, uniform guidance, and parallel action — a pattern the court could not ignore.', 'The injunction blocks further implementation of these reorganization plans and freezes pending layoffs across dozens of agencies. It protects not only the workers facing immediate job loss, but also the communities that rely on them — including veterans, children, seniors, and vulnerable populations who depend on public programs.', 'The ruling also recognizes the importance of judicial review in checking unlawful executive overreach. Had the court accepted the government’s argument that these were just run-of-the-mill personnel moves, the president could have cleared out entire agencies with no recourse, so long as the removals were laundered through existing RIF rules.', 'Instead, the court looked beyond labels to examine the functional reality of what was happening: not discrete employment actions, but a coordinated dismantling of agency capacity across the federal government.', 'The injunction in AFGE v. Trump is not the only legal development stemming from the administration’s sweeping civil service policies.', 'In DHS Probationary Employees 1 Class v. Department of Homeland Security, the Merit Systems Protection Board recently certified a nationwide class appeal challenging mass terminations of probationary employees. These terminations — nearly 370 in total — were executed over just six days in February 2025 pursuant to a directive issued by DHS’s Chief Human Capital Officer. The Board found that the class certification was appropriate and ordered additional briefing on whether the terminations constituted an unlawful RIF. If the Board finds jurisdiction, it could open the door to reinstatement or relief for hundreds of affected employees.', 'Meanwhile, in the District of Massachusetts, another federal court has issued a significant ruling in a consolidated case brought by 21 states, school districts, and unions including the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), AFSCME, and SEIU. There, Judge Myong J. Joun granted a preliminary injunction halting a March 2025 RIF that cut more than 2,100 employees from the U.S. Department of Education. The court found that the RIF, combined with attempts to transfer or abandon core statutory functions like student loans and special education, violated multiple constitutional and statutory provisions — including the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act.', 'Judge Joun rejected the administration’s claim that the RIF was a benign reorganization, writing that the evidence pointed to a deliberate effort to dismantle the Department without Congressional authorization. The court ordered reinstatement of terminated employees and restoration of programs to preserve the agency’s statutory mandates.', 'In a separate case out of the District of Rhode Island, Rhode Island v. Trump, a federal court also issued a preliminary injunction halting implementation of Executive Order 14210 as it applied to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). The court found that the administration’s attempt to eliminate core FMCS programs—without statutory repeal or appropriations changes—likely violated both constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act. The injunction blocks the planned RIF at FMCS and preserves the agency’s mediation and conflict resolution functions through the pendency of the litigation.', 'The federal government has already appealed the preliminary injunction in AFGE v. Trump to the Ninth Circuit and is seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to stay the lower court’s order. The outcome of that request may determine whether agencies can resume layoffs and reorganizations while litigation continues.', 'For now, the preliminary injunction remains in effect. It freezes the implementation of Executive Order 14210 across dozens of agencies, protecting not just employees at risk of termination, but the public programs they serve.', 'The case is far from over, but the court’s message is clear: even sweeping changes must comply with the law. Structural reorganization of the federal government cannot proceed through backdoor executive planning.', 'Suzanne Summerlin (LinkedIn) is a labor and employment attorney specializing in federal workforce issues.', ""DON'T MISS A THING.

""More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain — at taxpayer expense — thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.""', 'Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House.

Illston's order covers 21 federal agencies and DOGE, and prevents them proceeding with the sweeping reorganization of the federal government."", ""The judge also barred agencies from implementing any orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with Mr. Trump's February executive order. She clarified that the injunction does not limit agencies from proposing their own reorganization plans to Congress or engaging in their own planning activities without the involvement of OMB, OPM or DOGE. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as AmeriCorps and the Social Security Administration, among others."", 'In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch — but only after obtaining approval from Congress.', '""Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,"" the judge said. ""But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that — by statute — they must carry out.

"State Department ‘appears’ to be violating court order by issuing layoffs as soon as June 13, judge says",https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/06/state-department-appears-be-violating-court-order-issuing-layoffs-soon-june-13-judge-says/405811/,"['', '', 'The State Department’s reorganization is expected to lead to thousands of job cuts. KEVIN DIETSCH/GETTY IMAGES', 'Sponsor Message', '', '', 'Stay Connected', 'Sponsor Message', '', '', 'A federal judge on Wednesday said the State Department appears to be violating her pause on most agency layoffs by moving forward with planned cuts, though she asked for additional evidence before making a final decision. ', 'The Trump administration told the court that the State Department’s reorganization, expected to lead to thousands of job cuts, is permissible even under the current preliminary injunction and layoff notices could go out as soon as next week. Susan Illston, a district judge in California, held an emergency hearing after the plaintiffs in the case—a consortium of federal employee unions, municipalities and advocacy groups—accused the administration of violating the judge’s order. ', 'The Trump administration argued in advance of, and during, Thursday’s hearing that State’s reorganization was conducted separately from President Trump’s mandate that all agencies slash their workforces and instead occurred only at the instruction of Secretary Marco Rubio. Because Illston’s order applied only to Trump’s executive order and subsequent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management, the Justice Department lawyers said, State’s plans were not subject to the injunction. ', 'The administration has taken “a broad range of actions” to top planned RIFs at 17 agencies, said Andrew Bernie, a Justice attorney, but State’s plans represented “a special case.” ', 'Illston first issued a temporary restraining order pausing State and most major agencies from carrying out reorganizations and related staffing cuts under Trump’s orders on May 10, then extended the pause indefinitely by issuing a preliminary injunction on May 22. ', 'Attorneys for the plaintiffs, however, noted that State disseminated a fact sheet in April on the reorganization that said department officials would “submit a path to reducing staff in domestic offices by 15%, consistent with the president’s Workforce Optimization Initiative.” That initiative was part of Illston’s injunction. Bernie countered that State’s actions were merely consistent with that initiative but not taken because of it.', 'Bernie added that State could move forward with its layoffs as soon as June 13. State is expected to shed more than 3,400 employees, though it will rely on both reductions in force and voluntary separations to meet that total. Bernie said State informed him that while employees could receive their layoff notices next week, actual separations would not occur until mid-August for civil servants and mid-October for foreign service officers. ', 'Illston said she was not ready to make a decision, but was leaning toward siding with the plaintiffs. ', '“It appears to me, anyway, that what is being implemented at the State Department now is covered by the injunction,” the judge said. ', 'She ordered the Trump administration to submit evidence proving State’s reorganization was taking place separately from Trump’s demands and OMB and OPM’s guidance by Monday. Plaintiffs will then have an opportunity to respond and Illston will hold a hearing to make a determination either June 12 or June 13, depending on when State asserts the RIFs are set to occur. ', 'At that hearing, Illston will also determine whether the renewed dismissals of probationary employees at the Housing and Urban Development Department violated her order. As Government Executive first reported, HUD has re-fired some of its probationary employees since Illston first paused agency restructurings. The plaintiffs in the case suggested that may have violated the judge’s order, but Bernie said those firings were not subject to the injunction. ', 'At the Health and Human Services Department, meanwhile, the Trump administration conceded that some employees in the Administration for Community Living who had previously received RIF notices were given offboarding after Illston’s order went into effect. HHS has subsequently informed those workers that offboarding is on hold. The National Institutes of Health moved some employees to administrative leave, but has since reversed those changes. ', 'The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has denied the Trump administration’s request to strike down Illston’s injunction. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, and the high court requested initial filings by next week.', 'Related articles', 'Most major agencies are now indefinitely barred from issuing mass layoffs', ""Here's where the State Department is planning its layoffs and changes"", '', 'How are these changes affecting you?

A Court Told Trump to Reverse Ed. Dept. Layoffs. Will It Happen?,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/a-court-told-trump-to-reverse-ed-dept-layoffs-will-it-happen/2025/06,"['Updated: This story has been updated to reflect new court documents and remarks from Education Secretary Linda McMahon.', 'A federal judge’s order directing President Donald Trump’s administration to reinstate laid-off U.S. Department of Education staff has not yet resulted in employees returning to work, much less the full restoration of a federal agency the president hopes to eliminate.', 'And if the administration gets its way, it will be able to delay following the reinstatement order indefinitely while continuing to whittle away at the Education Department, legal experts say.', 'Despite a court order issued May 22 calling on the Education Department to undo the firings of hundreds of department staffers, employees who were let go in a mass reduction in force in March have received no communication about returning to work, according to multiple staff members.', '', 'It’s not exactly surprising. Some staff were already doubtful that the Trump administration would follow the decision from a Massachusetts-based federal judge, especially as it has resisted similar orders concerning other agencies while pursuing legal appeals.', 'And the administration has made clear it intends to push back on the Education Department order; it filed an emergency appeal within hours of Judge Myong Joun issuing his order, arguing in a statement that “a far-left judge has dramatically overstepped his authority.” Trump’s administration has prevailed in a number of appeals already.', 'Despite the court telling the Education Department to reinstate employees, litigation doesn’t shift policy quickly, nor do court orders make detailed policy, said Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center and professor of education policy and law at the University of Colorado Boulder.', '“It’s a very blunt tool, and it tends to move slowly. It’s the only tool that is available now. Clearly the courts have been important in preventing illegal and unconstitutional actions thus far,” Welner said. “But even setting aside the current Supreme Court’s predisposition to rule in favor of the administration, the courts have limited ability to force the administration to carry out executive functions.”', 'In March, the Education Department announced it would shed nearly half its staff through layoffs and buyout offers, bringing the agency’s footprint from more than 4,000 employees to fewer than 2,200. The reduction in force gutted offices, shrinking teams that oversee research, English language acquisition, and civil rights enforcement. About a week later, the president signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “facilitate” the department’s closure—acting on a long-awaited campaign promise.', 'The layoffs and order prompted immediate litigation, with plaintiffs arguing that the Trump administration was overstepping its executive power by dissolving an agency without approval from Congress, which is the only entity that can legally abolish the 45-year-old department.', 'Joun concurred, and in May, he ordered that the department reinstate the hundreds of employees it had terminated since Trump took office. He also halted enforcement of the president’s executive order. He directed the department to swiftly notify employees of his decision.', 'The Trump administration quickly appealed the order, known as a preliminary injunction, and also requested that Joun stay—or pause—his injunction. Both Joun and a panel of appeals court judges denied that request, however. The appeals court has yet to rule on a different administration request to block Joun’s order.', '', 'But even though the injunction remains in effect, little has changed in the week and a half since Joun issued it.', 'According to a declaration from the Education Department’s human resources head filed in court on May 27, the department informed all staff, including those who were laid off, of the court’s order via email and posted a notice to the department website.', '', 'The email, included in the declaration, provided no further detail on what the court order meant for staff, however. Several employees told Education Week they have received no additional information on possible reinstatement.', '“We’ve seen signs of noncompliance with federal rulings over the past 100-plus days from this administration. It would not be surprising if that kind of response would continue forth in response to this particular injunction,” said Robert Kim, executive director of the Education Law Center, which leads education-related litigation.', 'The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a June 4 budget hearing before a House of Representatives committee, McMahon told lawmakers the department would comply with the judge’s order.', 'And according to another declaration filed in court late Tuesday, June 3, the department has convened a committee of senior leaders “to discuss the status of post-RIF activities across department programs and operations, and the impacts of the preliminary injunction on those activities.” The committee discussed the “complex and costly challenges” of again onboarding roughly 1,400 employees, which included securing physical office space and starting contract negotiations.', 'Still, the Education Department is just one of several federal agencies that have seen their staff gutted—and subsequently been the subject of legal challenges.', 'At least half a dozen lawsuits have challenged reductions in force across the federal government, Welner said. Some have been stayed by higher courts, meaning a lower court’s injunction stopping the dismissals has been halted; other courts have dismissed cases entirely, saying those who sued had no standing to file such litigation.', '', '“There are a lot of cases, and this one is consistent—it’s following a path that is similar to many other cases,” Welner said.', 'Trump’s administration has prevailed in some of its appeals on other matters, too. After the Education Department canceled scores of grants funding teacher training, a case challenging those terminations went before Joun, who ruled that those dollars had to be reinstated. An appeals court agreed, but the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing the department to shed more than 100 grants.', 'A federal appeals court in a separate case challenging teacher-training grant terminations subsequently blocked a lower court’s restoration of those grants, citing the Supreme Court decision.', 'But even in cases where the lower court’s decision holds, the department can continue trying to resist.', 'When a judge found that the termination of probationary employees across the federal government, including at the Education Department, was illegal, the employees were reinstated—only to be immediately placed on administrative leave. A federal judge took issue with that response, but the Supreme Court later sided with the Trump administration.', 'The Education Department case could culminate in something similar: If the department reinstates these employees, McMahon and other agency leaders could tell them simply to not do their jobs, Welner said.', '', 'In cases like these, the court doesn’t prescribe steps for the administration to take to enforce the laws enacted by Congress. It simply says that what the administration has done is illegal, he said.', '“The administration can say, ‘OK, well, that was illegal. Now I’m going to try these dozen other things to get to my same goal,’” Welner said. “And you have to step in each time and say, ‘Nope, that one’s not OK. That one’s not OK, either.’', '“Each time that that’s done, you have the district court acting, and then the Circuit Court of Appeals acting, and then the U.S. Supreme Court acting,” he said. “It just takes a long time. … There’s just limited things the court can do.”', '', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhNM2s1WVZaU1RYbHdaRFY2VFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdZQndJNUtQUVU=-w280-h168-p-df
