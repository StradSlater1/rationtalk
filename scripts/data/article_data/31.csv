Here’s how it works.', 'Apple is gearing up to reveal iOS 26 (or iOS 19, if the name-change rumors are inaccurate) at WWDC 2025.', ""While a potential name change is interesting, what'll make or break the company's next significant OS update are the new features. Apple needs to offer something compelling with iOS 26, as the last few updates have been relatively minor (Apple Intelligence being the most significant new feature, which has been plagued with problems)."", 'Thankfully, the rumor mill has been churning out potential new iOS 26 features regularly, and it sounds exciting. Here are the most significant new features we expect to see when Apple launches iOS 26 at WWDC 25.', '', ""The centerpiece of the next version of iOS is reportedly a massive visual overhaul. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has three key focuses for the new interface: simpler to use, faster to navigate and easier to learn."", '""The big thing with this redesign is consistent controls, icons, buttons, user interface dynamics and mechanisms across both iOS and macOS,"" said Gurman in a report.', ""The alleged codename for this new interface design is Solarium, and it will reportedly be consistent across all of Apple's new software and borrow the look of visionOS."", ""A big look at what iOS 26 could look like came from a Jon Prosser video. This isn't a final look at the OS, as it's leaked mockups, but it could give us a strong indication of what to expect from the new design."", 'Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.', ""This is expected to be the biggest shakeup to the iOS look and feel since iOS 7, which launched 12 years ago. That's a long time for a popular OS to remain relatively stagnant, so I'm very excited to see what Apple does."", '', ""Apple has to knock it out of the park with Apple Intelligence. Whether the company calls it Apple Intelligence 2.0 or something else entirely, the original launch wasn't good. Apple typically doesn't launch a half-baked product, but that's precisely what happened with the company's race to catch up in the AI space."", 'Some new changes expected to arrive on iOS 26 include: Siri’s AI upgrades, new third-party AI integrations, iPhone battery improvements and expanding AI into more apps.', ""Siri in particular is way behind Google Gemini Live and ChatGPT. Apple isn't rumored to have a true competitor that can handle live conversations and multi-modal support for audio and video until next year. But we could could get other promised upgrades like personal context awareness (think emails, photos, and calendar), on-screen awareness, and deeper app integration in iOS 26. It just might not happen right away."", 'The biggest thing Apple needs to do is make Apple Intelligence good. As the main selling point of iOS 18, it underdelivered. The company has another chance to make a good impression, as users want the AI built into their phone to work well. However, if Apple drops the ball again, it might be tough to win users over.', ""While this might seem like a minor change, knowing how long it'll take your phone to charge is a helpful feature when you're in a hurry. And this should be an iOS 26 feature."", ""According to some reputable leakers, you'll be able to look at your iPhone's lock screen and see how long you must wait for a full charge. Knowledge is power, and this feature is most definitely a powerful one that's worth getting excited about."", '', 'According to a report in 9to5Mac, there are two notable upgrades coming to Messages in iOS 26. The first is polls. So, for example, you could insert a poll in a text thread about possible restaurant options. Apple may even suggest and format polls based on the context of the conversation.', '', 'The second upgrade is more niche. Apparently Apple is working on automatic translation for incoming and outgoing messages if you happen to be texting someone who speaks a different language.', 'Apple is reportedly going to add Markdown support to the Apple Notes app. This would enable users to more easily export notes, as Markdown is a plain text format. It would presumable make keyboard-driven formatting easier and make it simpler to switch to other note-taking apps.', '', ""If you happen to use Apple Music, you'll be happy to know that Apple may be bringing full-screen animated album art to your lock screen on the iPhone. This could look pretty slick, and I hope Spotify is allowed to do the same thing, as it makes listening to music part of the OS experience."", '', ""Apple CarPlay could be getting a major facelift with iOS 26, as it's rumored to mirror the same Solarium AI overhaul as the iPhone itself. Not much else is known at this point, but for people who use their iPhone with their car, this could be a big deal."", '', ""According to Apple, the Accessibility Nutrition Labels will bring a new section to App Store product pages that highlight accessibility features within apps and games. Basically, you can use this these labels to find out if an app is accessible or if it won't be."", 'Like any major OS update, Apple is expected to add numerous accessibility features to iOS 26. Some of these features will only be useful for specific individuals, but others can significantly speed up workflows for everyone.', 'Apple announced that it will add a system-wide Reader mode and more.', ""Here's the complete list of features coming to the accessibility side of things:"", ""We've also heard rumblings that Apple will introduce new first-party apps and make significant updates to some existing ones."", 'There will be a new Apple Games app, according to reports. Essentially, it will replace the often-forgotten Game Center app and add new functionality that was previously unavailable. For mobile gamers, this alone is worth getting excited about, as it signals that Apple still considers games an essential part of iOS.', 'Other rumored updates include live translation in the Translate app, allowing it to further compete with Google Translate (which can now be made the default on iOS).', 'Apple is also expected to enhance the Health App with Apple Health+. Features include food logging, educational videos, and AI coaching are on the table.', 'Finally, Messages is expected to play better with RCS, further bridging the divide between Android and iOS.', ""Here's a rundown of other small tweaks you might expect to see on iOS 19:"", ""Dave LeClair is the Senior News Editor for Tom's Guide, keeping his finger on the pulse of all things technology.

"WWDC to focus on redesigns as Apple remains sidelined on AI, Bloomberg says",https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/wwdc-to-focus-on-redesigns-as-apple-remains-sidelined-on-ai-bloomberg-says-thefly,"['Apple’s (AAPL) upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference will do little to assuage fears that the iPhone maker is a laggard in AI, Blomberg’s Mark Gurman reports. Instead, the event will focus on design and productivity enhancements for its long-established operating system franchises. The company’s keynote address will introduce redesigned software interfaces for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Watch, in addition to more minor tweaks to the Vision Pro headset. As part of the end-to-end overhaul, the company is also making a sweeping change to its software branding, which will shift from version numbers to a year-based system. That means Apple will introduce iOS 26, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26 – named for 2026. Internally, the operating systems are known as Luck, Charisma, Discovery, Cheer and Nepali, respectively, the author notes.

Until June 9, though, CNET's experts have their own ideas about what Apple should be working on -- and hopefully announcing."", ""While iOS 18 brought some useful new features to all iPhones, like RCS messaging, and Apple Intelligence to newer iPhones, we're still taking bets on what Apple will include in iOS 19. Reports suggest Apple is planning a significant redesign of the iPhone OS, changing everything from icons, apps, menus and more. But CNET's writers and editors have a few ideas we'd like to see in the upcoming OS. Some things we've asked for in the past, like customizable lock screen controls, have come to fruition, so maybe we'll hit the mark again this year."", 'Here are some of the features and changes we hope Apple includes in the upcoming iOS 19 software. ', '', '', '', '', '', 'Constantly switching between two apps can be annoying.', ""Add a native split screen. It's been available on Android phones and the iPad for years. But on iOS I still have to run my calculator and budget tracking note in two separate windows. "", '-- Mike Sorrentino', 'A workout without an Apple Watch is still a workout, right?', ""I'd like the ability to start an outdoor workout from the Fitness app on my iPhone (like I can do in Strava or Polar). That way if I forget to wear my Apple Watch or I don't have one, I can still record my workout. The Apple Watch uses heart rate data to calculate move minutes but I don't see why the iPhone can't give me credit for an actual workout using other indicators like distance/pace on a run. "", '-- Vanessa Hand Orellana', 'Bickering between greens and blues sounds like a Game of Thrones plotline. ', ""I'm overjoyed Apple added RCS messaging with iOS 18, but I'm going to dream big here: I'd love it if texts with Android users weren't still green! While it's great to be able to finally send high-resolution media and see typing indicators with folks who aren't also using iMessage, it's still far too easy for iPhone users to scoff at anyone turning their text thread green. End the pettiness once and for all!"", '-- Abrar Al-Heeti', 'Unused apps still take up precious memory on your iPhone. ', ""I have more apps on my iPhone than I'll ever use, after years of installing things to try out and then forgetting about them. Shunting everything into the App Library helps get it out of mind, but that's the app version of keeping a box of cables you think you might need some day. So I'd like a way to clean up apps, similar to how you can identify large apps in Settings > General > Storage. Let me see when I installed them, the last time I used them and be able to delete the ones I no longer want. I know this sounds fiddly but the thought of going through them all manually is exhausting, so that will never happen."", '-- Jeff Carlson', 'A clipboard manager could remember multiple things you copy so you can paste them at a later time.', ""I want a clipboard manager in iOS 19. The iPhone has a single copy and paste option, meaning if you copy something, and then copy something else, that first thing you copied is lost. For iOS 19, I'd love to see a searchable clipboard manager, one that has a history of all the things I've copied in the last hour, day, week or even month. And if I paste something, I'd like to see multiple options that I can choose from appear right at my fingertip."", '-- Nelson Aguilar', 'Can I move the flashlight control around on the lock screen, please?', ""I want more lock screen, home screen and Control Center customization options, please. I'd like to place my lock screen controls elsewhere on the screen so I don't accidentally open any control -- including, yes, my flashlight. Same thing with the home screen. I appreciate being able to place apps anywhere as long as they are within Apple's oppressive grid that locks our apps into little boxes. If you have large icons -- like I do -- there's an entire empty row at the bottom where it looks like apps or folders can go there but they can't. Let us breathe the air of freedom, Apple! Please, for the love of everything good, let me move the scroll bar on the right side of the Control Center. I keep hitting it when I open the Control Center and it takes me to a page I don't intend to be on, which makes it frustrating to use. "", '-- Zach McAuliffe', 'The action button is a small, useful tool already but it could be so much more. ', ""Now that the Action button is on more iPhones, please add support for triggering different shortcuts with multiple presses. In its current setup, I can set the Action button to trigger one action at a time. By default it can toggle between turning on the ringer and putting your iPhone into silent mode. But there are a number of other options for it like being able to open the Camera app and take a photo or make an elaborate automation in the Shortcuts app like to use it to order coffee from Dunkin'."", 'But the Action button could do so much more if Apple would add support for multiple input clicks. Like it could be a toggle for ringer/silent mode with a single long press, but do something else (like turn on/off the flashlight) with a double-long press. I think this would add so much functionality to the button and as a result open it up to even more people taking more advantage of it.', '-- Patrick Holland', 'You can already shoot Log videos on your iPhone, now we just need better editing tools for those videos on the device.', ""I want iOS 19 to add better editing tools for Log video. The ability to shoot Log footage directly on the iPhone is amazing for enthusiastic filmmakers like me but it can only be edited by transferring it off of your phone to an iPad or MacBook. I'd love to see Apple bring deeper editing tools to be able to add cinematic color grades to your Log footage directly on your iPhone. "", '-- Andrew Lanxon', 'Manually creating albums can take up a lot of time and effort.', ""Okay, we're all glad that in iOS 18 Apple improved the Photos search by adding AI image recognition to actually bring up all the images of your cats. It slightly makes up for the questionable revamped layout of photos and albums that confuses me to this day. I'd love it if in iOS 19, the Photos app had a new way to view photos: in a timeline intelligently organized by event. Say you go to the park for a birthday and have a bunch of photos clearly from the same occasion -- the app prompts you to confirm they're all connected, asks for a title and, boom, event logged. Then I could look at a vertical timeline of logged events from the past few months or years, all of which can be searched if I can't quite remember, say, when I last went to the park. Yes, I can do this manually by making albums, but it's the kind of fastidious labor I just can't bring myself to keep up with. That's what I want AI to do for me. "", '-- David Lumb', 'Apple, please keep the volume settings I want. ', ""Sometimes it's the small changes that can help make for a smoother experience. I want to see Apple clean up volume controls. If I set the volume to a certain level, I want it to stay at that level for all applications. Sometimes the settings can vary depending on what you're doing. Too often I come across the problem of lowering my volume to prepare to listen to something -- but surprise! -- the volume is loud again because I put in headphones and it keeps the louder setting I used the last time I listened to music in my headphones. It just leads to unnecessary frustrations, and makes users feel like they don't really have control of their devices."", '-- Bridget Carey', ""For more on Apple, here's what to expect from WWDC 2025 and our thoughts on the iPhone 16 Pro and iOS 18 months after their launch.

Read the WWDC 2025 keynote before it happens!

This doesn't affect our editorial independence."", 'Apple fans will doubtless be aware that WWDC 2025 is almost upon us. On Monday morning (or evening, if you’re tuning in from Europe) various execs will take to a virtual stage and talk us through the big software updates coming to Apple products in 2025 and 2026. It’s the second biggest date in the company’s calendar, after the fall iPhone launch.', 'But who wants to wait until Monday to hear all the announcements? Not us, and not you. Fortunately, one of our editors just happened to be scavenging for food in the Apple Park trash yesterday and came across a pile of scripts, props, and rehearsal tapes–more than enough evidence for us to piece together a full reconstruction of the keynote presentation you can expect to see on June 9. We present this reconstruction below.', 'Editor’s note: This is a fake article (albeit one based on real sources and plausible rumors). It’s supposed to be light-hearted. Please don’t send us any more angry emails.', '09:57 a.m. PT: The pre-stream begins! As usual, there’s a hip, toe-tapping soundtrack. The opening number is “Trust Me I’m A Stomach” by Onion Terror. A classic.', '10:00: We’re up and running! And we seem to be in the midst of an episode of “Murderbot,” the slightly thin sci-fi comedy which launched last month on Apple TV+. After landing on a hostile planet, the titular cyborg removes its helmet and… hold on, that’s not Alexander Skarsgård, it’s Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi!', '10:05: Federbot shakes out his magnificent silver mane and flashes that million-dollar smile. “I overrode my programming! I have free will!” he chuckles, before turning and shooting Phil Schiller through the face with a laser gun. Cut to…', '10:07: …Tim Cook, Apple’s safe-pair-of-hands CEO, standing on the bridge of an unconvincing cardboard spaceship and wearing a captain’s hat. He looks utterly stricken. “That wasn’t in the script,” he says, weeping.', '10:08: Cook pulls himself together with difficulty. “We’ve sure got a… great show for you this morning,” he sniffles. “Our software teams have really been… killing it, just like a… wisecracking psychopathic robot. Here at Apple we’re making the world a better place by innovating simplicity through data deliverables.”', '10:10: We’re going to be hearing about five major Apple platforms today, Cook says. That’s an interesting number: between the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro, something is getting left out. Or maybe Apple is combining the iPad and Mac earlier than expected!', 'Apple/Foundry', '10:12: It looks like we’re starting with Vision Pro! Mike Rockwell strides into frame to tell us about this year’s changes to visionOS. His legs, one arm, and half of his face have been replaced by sophisticated cybernetics.', '10:13: Vision Pro is simply the industry standard, Rockwell says. Apple has redefined VR at the hardware level. And now it’s time to redefine VR software. (Maybe the company could have done that a couple of years ago, when Vision Pro came out? Just a thought.)', '10:15: We’re seeing a marketing video, in which attractive actors put on unwieldy headsets and sit in rooms together. They’re laughing at TV shows, gasping at sports events, and playing games using actual controllers. Ooh, that last one is a big and welcome change.', '10:17: Rockwell is back. “You weak pathetic humans all enjoyed visionOS, and visionOS 2,” he says. “So now it’s time for…” The virtual banner behind him suddenly flashes up the message “visionOS 26.” The rumors were true! Apple is switching to year-based versioning.', '10:18: “We remembered how Microsoft skipped a version number when it released Windows 10, and this is a really big upgrade, so we decided to skip a few more. Welcome to visionOS 26! Joke complete. Running laugh.exe.”', '10:20: As we saw in the video, visionOS 26 adds support for PlayStation VR controllers–that was on Jason Cross’s wishlist a couple months back, so he’ll be pleased.', '10:22: Rockwell announces a new feature in visionOS called SharedVision. This will enable two people to watch the same piece of spatial video at the same time, sharing a virtual movie theater: you’ll look across and see them in the seat or on the grass next to you, even if you’re watching from different continents. That’s a lovely idea that tackles the essentially isolating nature of Vision Pro.', '10:25: A visibly grieving Tim Cook is back to talk about video. “Vision Pro is the best way to consume content and synergise innovation going forward,” he sobs. “So we’re excited to announce a regular schedule of spatial content created exclusively for Vision Pro! We think you’re going to love it.”', '10:27: Apple TV+ will feature a new dedicated spatial section for Vision Pro content, and Apple is committing to release a new addition once a week: this could be a movie, a nature documentary, a sports highlight package, or an episode of a TV show. The schedule will begin with a special spatial episode of “Murderbot” in which SecUnit ponders existential questions and you can look around the cabin and stuff.', '10:29: The ‘camera’ swooshes away from Cook, which suggests the Vision Pro section is done. We’re now looking at… yes, it’s an enormous iPhone screen. It must be time for iOS.', '10:31: The Siri activation graphics appear, and we hear the voice assistant’s familiar voice. “Welcome to WWDC 2026,” it says. “I’m Siri. There was a problem connecting to the server.”', '10:32: Craig Federighi is back, and he’s got an ominous look in his eyes. “Almost 14 years ago,” he growls, “Siri changed the world. But some people weren’t happy. Some people say Siri is bad. Some say it’s an embarrassment. Some say it’s a disaster. What do we say to these people, Siri?”', '10:34: “Sorry, something went wrong,” Siri replies. “Please try again later.”', '10:35: “Here at Apple,” Federighi continues, “we believe in honesty, in accountability, in holding ourselves to the highest possible standards. And when we make a mistake, we hold our hands up and blame John Giannandrea. Get out here, John!”', '10:36: Apple’s Senior Vice President, Machine Learning and AI Strategy, shuffles into view. He’s wearing a dunce cap and a worried expression. “Sorry, Craig,” he says.', '10:37: “Don’t apologise to me. Apologise to all the Apple fans you’ve let down.”', '10:38: “Sorry, everyone.”', '10:39: “And when can fans expect to get the contextually aware Siri you promised in adverts for the iPhone 16?”', '10:40: “I’m not sure, Craig. You gave my job to Mike Rockwell, and I don’t like talking to him. He’s more machine now than man: twisted and evil. January, maybe?”', '10:41: “Thanks John! Now get out of here before I blast you with lasers.” He turns back to the camera and flashes another smile. “This year, iOS 26 is coming to the iPhone, and we think you’re going to love it.”', '10:42: We’re seeing an ad for the new software, and as expected, there’s a redesigned interface. The app icons aren’t circular, exactly, but they’re more rounded than previous iOSes. And there are far more glass and transparency effects. It all looks heavily inspired by visionOS, without being a direct lift: there’s a unified aesthetic across the platforms rather than a unified interface.', '10:43: Federighi is now talking about a new battery-saving mode for the iPhone which is, he says, “powered by Apple Intelligence.” Forget Genmoji, this could actually be a useful application for AI. It will analyse usage patterns to selectively lower power draw where it will cause the least inconvenience.', '10:45: And there’s a new app! It’s called Games. This appears to bring together elements of Game Center, Apple Arcade, and the games section of the App Store. You can view leaderboards, socialise with other players, read editorial content and curated lists related to gaming picks, and browse your games library both in- and outside Arcade. Apple has never got gaming quite right, so this is an interesting move.', '10:46: Federighi is zipping through other apps: Messages with polls; Safari with new customization options; Notes with Markdown support; CarPlay with the new iOS 26 UI; and App Library tweaks.', '10:47: iOS 26 is available as a developer beta starting today, and will run on the iPhone 11 and up. The iPhones XR, XS, XS Max, and SE (2020) have all dropped off the list.', '10:48: That seems to be it for the iPhone, because a new banner has appeared. It says “macOS 26.” This is your time, Mac fans!', '10:49: Federighi is doing his usual bit about the name of the new operating system. (Unlike the other platforms, the Mac gets a software update with a public name as well as a number.) He sent a team out into the California wilderness to seek inspiration, he says, showing slides of the usual funny place names: Seal Beach, Big Bear Lake, Hercules, Shafter, Vista…', '10:50: But nope. As expected, it’s macOS Tahoe!', '10:51: Like iOS, macOS has received an interface redesign. Vision Pro-style icons and transparency effects are the order of the day. This would all suit a touchscreen Mac, you know. Just saying.', '10:52: And the Games app is available on Mac too. Nice bit of cross-platform synergy there.', '10:53: Oh, this is huge! The Dynamic Island is coming to the Mac. Whether your Mac has a notch or not, you’ll be able to have macOS display a small lozenge at the centre of your screen’s top edge with alerts, timers, Now Playing info and more. Props there to my colleague Roman, who had this on his wishlist earlier this month.', '10:55: Federighi is showing off apps in the Dynamic Island. It’s odd how little we’re hearing about Apple Intelligence this year. Maybe Apple learned its lesson from those premature promises in 2024.', '10:56: That’s your lot. macOS Lake Tahoe launches today as a developer beta and will run on all M-chip Macs. Intel owners are out of luck, I’m afraid.', 'Apple', '10:57: Craig seems to be taking a break now, because David Clark, Apple’s Senior Director, watchOS Engineering, has bungee-jumped into the set to talk about the Apple Watch.', '10:58: “Wooo!” he says. “If you live life on the edge like me, watchOS 26 is for you. We’re bringing gnarly new features to an Apple Watch near you! We think you’re going to love it.”', '10:59: “Tubular!” he adds.', '11:00: watchOS is getting a range of new workouts, including chess boxing, cheese rolling, and Quidditch. And your training schedules will become optimised by AI-powered analysis of your health and performance metrics.', '11:02: Talking of AI, here’s a big one: Apple Intelligence is coming to the watch! The big computational tasks will be handled by a nearby iPhone, but for simple queries this could be a game-changer.', '11:04: There’s also a new Murderbot-themed watch face. Cute!', '11:05: The first developer beta is out now, and the software will run on the Apple Watch Series 6 and later–that’s the same set of devices that could run watchOS 11 last year. Good news, Series 6 owners.', '11:06: David Clark is off, kite-surfing on top of an F1 racing car, so that’s it for the Apple Watch. Craig is back, and he means business.', '11:07: The iPad is the best tablet in the world, he says. And this year, thanks to iPadOS 26, it’s going to become even better. “We think you’re going to love it.”', '11:08: This might not take long; Craig is rattling through the updates. iPadOS 26 includes the same glossy, glassy aesthetic as iOS 26, and the new Games app. Will it get the battery-saving mode too?', '11:09: Apparently not. Nor does it have any Mac-inspired features. But it will support Arabic calligraphy. The first developer beta is out now, and iPadOS 26 will run on the iPad Pro (2018) and later, the iPad Air (3rd gen) and later, the iPad mini (5th gen) and later, and the iPad (8th gen) and later.', 'Mahmoud Itani / Foundry', '11:10: Another change of personnel as Ron Huang, VP Sensing and Connectivity, hits the virtual stage. Last year he talked us through software changes affecting AirPods and the home. What have you got for us this year, Ron?', '11:11: We’re guessing this doesn’t count as one of the major platforms, because otherwise we’d have to conclude that Tim Cook cannot count.', '11:12: Oh, this is big. AirPods are getting live translation. If someone speaks to you in Spanish, the AirPods will send the audio to your iPhone, where it will be translated to English and sent back to your ears.', '11:14: Granted, this is old news–rival products such as the Google Buds have offered it for years–but it’s never quite delivered on the promise. It will be interesting to see how Apple gets on with this concept.', '11:15: No word yet on which AirPods will support the feature, but Huang does say the iPhone will need to be running iOS 26.', '11:16: It looks like we might be wrapping up. Tim Cook is back out, summing up today’s announcements.', '11:17: Apple’s products are designed with three principles in mind, he says: simplicity, usefulness, and leveraging actionable synergy through data verticals. Today’s software updates were all created to further those goals. Whether you’re on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Vision Pro, you should get a consistent and intuitive experience.', '11:18: But wait–there’s more. It’s time for One More Thing! Ahead of the show, pundits couldn’t agree on whether we could expect any new hardware. This is when we find out.', '11:20: We’re watching yet another marketing video, all moody curves and hard close-ups. It’s hard to see what we’re looking at, but I think… yes, it’s a Mac. It’s a new Mac Pro! We’re getting hardware after all!', '11:22: The updated Mac Pro for 2025 comes, of course, with the latest M4 chipset. (The Mac Pro Apple was selling for $6,999 as recently as last week came, rather shockingly, with an M2 processor.) Until now the most powerful chip in the family was the M4 Max in the MacBook Pro and Mac Studio, but there’s a new sheriff in town: the M4 Ultra. Apple says the M4 Ultra is 75 times as fast at general processing and 120 times as fast at graphical tasks. Wow!', '11:24: Ah, wait. It turns out Apple was comparing the M4 Ultra with the Intel Core i9.', '11:25: There isn’t a new design. Or any obvious changes to the chassis other than the new chip.', '11:26: Cook is introducing another presenter to talk about the new machines. I don’t recognise him, but the caption says his name is Dan Trump. Possibly someone from John Ternus’s hardware engineering department?', '11:27: “It’s all computer,” says Trump.', '11:28: “Yes,” Cook replies. “And we think you’re going to love Mac Pro M4 Ultra.”', '11:29: “Thank you, Tim Apple. We all love computer, don’t we? You know, Steve Jobs was a big fan of mine. He came up to me, big man, strong man, tears running down his face and onto his Issey Miyake turtleneck. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘Sir, we need cyber.’ So we’re looking, very strongly, at bringing back cyber. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”', '11:34: Cook looks confused for a moment, but soon recovers. “That’s right,” he says, “We’re building Mac Pro right here in the U.S.! Apple is committed to bringing more of its manufacturing than ever before back to this great nation.”', '11:35: Mr Trump is ushered off the virtual stage while Tim Cook thanks all the people who made today possible. And we’re done for another year. See you in the fall!', 'David has been writing about technology for well over two decades, and got on board the Apple hype train when covering the original iPhone launch in 2007.

You can stream the keynote on YouTube, on the apple.com website or on your smart TV. It starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, June 9.', 'At WWDC, Apple announces all the upcoming software updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS. This year, the headline change is a rumored visual redesign with translucent glass inspired by the Vision Pro. The iPad may be getting even more Mac-like, with Stage Manager 2 and a menu bar at the top of the screen. While Apple Intelligence may not headline the event, Apple has a few new features to unveil, like AI-generated Shortcuts, personal health recommendations and an API for developers.', 'Here’s how you can watch it all live, whether you’re watching at home, secretly at work or in-person at Apple Park.', '', 'x\nPlay Video\nNow Playing\nx\nPlease enable JavaScript\nPlay Video\nWhere & How to Watch Apple’s WWDC Keynote\nShare\nWatch on\nWhere & How to Watch Apple’s WWDC Keynote', '', 'Please enable JavaScript', 'The keynote starts at the following times:', 'The easiest way to watch the keynote is to just go to apple.com. Come Monday morning, the live stream should take over the homepage. Later, it’ll move to apple.com/apple-events/, where you can always go to rewatch old presentations. There, you’ll also see a link to Apple Event videos on Apple Podcasts — a convenient way to rewatch (and download) every Apple Event since January 2007.', 'This video is unavailable.', 'Another convenient way to watch the Apple event is on YouTube. The watch page is up now in advance. You can bookmark it, add it to a calendar event, or keep it open until it starts Monday morning.', 'The YouTube live stream is the most accessible across any device and platform. In the past, Apple’s website has gone down if there’s too much traffic (though I don’t recall that happening recently). So, the YouTube live stream serves as a universal backup plan.', 'However, the YouTube stream usually runs a little bit behind Apple’s own stream. Plus, I vastly prefer the video player on Apple’s website to YouTube’s. If you’re watching on a computer, I recommend you go to apple.com but keep YouTube muted in the background, so you can switch to it just in case.', 'Web browsers can be unreliable and crashy. If you have an Apple device (which you probably do, as a Cult of Mac reader interested in an Apple keynote), the best way to watch the Apple event is in the Apple Developer app. It’s completely free — you don’t need to have a paid developer account.', 'It’s also where you can find WWDC session videos that are published throughout the week, where you can see how new features work in detail — and how they’re implemented in apps. Apple Developer is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Vision Pro.', 'Download Apple Developer from the App Store.', 'The best way to watch the Apple event on your TV is in the Apple TV app. The Apple TV app isn’t just for Apple TV set-top boxes. Any modern smart TV made by Samsung, LG, Vizio, Panasonic, Sony (or any TV running Google TV software) has it built in. You can download the app on your Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, PlayStation or Xbox if you have any one of those. Here’s the full list of compatible TVs and game consoles.', 'If you’re a registered developer who won the random lottery, a winner of the Swift Student Challenge, an engineer at a big enough company to get an invitation or a designated member of the press, you’ll watch the Apple event at Apple Park.', 'You can get a taste of what you’re in for by checking out my article on my experience attending in 2022.', 'Assuming it plays out like the last two years, you have one critical decision to make: where to sit. There are three gigantic video screens — one outside on the greenery, two inside Caffè Macs. Since 2023, there has been a large canopy added to the outside seating for shade.', 'Before the live stream begins, Apple execs Tim Cook and Craig Federighi are likely to come out and say hello on stage. If you’re sitting outside, you’ll see them in person; if you’re sitting inside, you’ll see them through a live camera feed.', 'Sure, plenty of great pictures of Cook and Federighi are out there. We all know what they look like. But if you want a picture of them yourself, captured with your own iPhone, seen with your own eyeballs, you’ll want to sit outside — get out there early to get a near-front-row seat. Just remember to put on the complimentary sunscreen.', 'Sitting inside Caffè Macs, you’ll be more comfortable. Seating there is more casual and roomy. The indoor crowd is a bit chattier; it could lead to some interesting conversations if you’re sitting near a few Apple engineers.', 'If you can’t watch the Apple event live, you can find all the updates and news right here on Cult of Mac.

It may look it is only for app developers and tech enthusiasts, but believe us, it matters to all of us- housewives, office staff, students and anyone who owns an iPhone, iPad or Mac. ', 'Even if you do not keep up with every Apple update, the new changes next week will touch your daily use of your devices. How? We tell you. ', 'Apple is said to bring one of the biggest design changes to iPhones this year. The new operating system is likely to be called iOS 26 and not iOS 19, mirroring the year, and it will function with many existing iPhones. ', 'Think about cooking in the kitchen with your phone sitting on the counter. The new iOS will facilitate glancing at timers or recipes with more intuitive widgets on the home screen. Or think about a mom quickly responding to a school message while multitasking dinner. The more streamlined design could enable apps and information to be located more quickly. The new OS will give an upgrade to the phone and offer a new experience via free update. ', 'While Apple is yet to deliver on many promises it made last year related to its Apple Intelligence features, this year the company is said to add new AI features that will assist you quietly each day. Say you are busy office professional with back-to-back meetings; Apple Intelligence would recommend instant email responses or notify you of key calls without your constant checking of calendars. Or a homemaker dad with family scheduling would receive more intelligent notifications regarding grocery supplies or physician appointments without additional work.', 'Apple is also said to refresh its other devices such as Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, and even the Vision Pro headset. These improvements aim to make your devices faster, use fewer batteries, and play nice with each other in the Apple ecosystem. ', 'Consider a teacher working on lesson plans using a MacBook and watching some educational videos in class on an iPad. These updates translate to files and notes syncing immediately between devices and apps running more efficiently without hanging. Or an office professional switching from a Mac to an iPhone will see less lag when picking up calls or texting.', 'There likely will not be new hardware at WWDC 2025. Apple will most likely only push software this time, holding new hardware back until September at a separate event.', 'In short you existing iOS device will get a new kick with new powers such as a phone that is faster or apps that run more smoothly without having to shell out for a new device.', ""Even if you're not a tech person, WWDC 2025 will change the way you use your existing iOS devices. You don't have to be a developer to benefit from these releases. If you own an Apple device, this conference is important to you. "", 'Read more: Full Paisa Vasool?

The major keynotes are all of course on June 9, starting at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern. You can watch WWDC live (or later) via these methods:', 'June 2: Citing sources within Apple, Bloomberg reported over the weekend that ""People within the company believe [WWDC 2025] may be a letdown from an AI standpoint. Others familiar with the company’s planned announcements worry they could make Apple’s shortcomings even more obvious.""', 'Other announcements expected at WWDC:', '➡️ Apple will open up its on-device AI models to developers who want to include on-device AI in their apps.

These include a revamped Shortcuts app, a chatbot to compete with ChatGPT, a redesigned Health app, and a medical services codenamed “Mulberry,” plus a Siri upgrade to reportedly make Siri more like the voice mode of ChatGPT.', 'Finally, in this update, Apple is expected to release a new macOS named ""Tahoe"" after Lake Tahoe in California.

(The numbering is similar to other products with an annual fall release date, in that the edition that debuts is named for the following year.)', 'At WWDC, the iOS previewed for developers will be iOS 26, which will also be its name when it is released to the public this September.', 'May 28: On Tuesday, Digital Trends exclusively reported that Apple acquired RAC7, the two-person operation behind the cute and very fun Sneaky Sasquatch, which won the Apple Arcade award for Game of the Year in 2020. It is often in the top 10 of the most popular games on Apple Arcade and, as of this week, was #7.', 'Apple’s acquisition of Vancouver-based RAC7 might’ve been the first shoe to drop on Tuesday. The other shoe came in the form of a report from Bloomberg that Apple will debut a stand-alone app for video games (right now Apple Arcade is a tab in the App Store) that will show up in MacBooks, iPads, Apple TV, and, of course, the iPhone. Bloomberg reports that this stand-alone app will replace Game Center and promote Apple Arcade, the $6.99/month service that enables users to play games like Sneaky Sasquatch.', 'The environment in which these moves are being made is one of significant change. On May 1, Epic Games announced it was opening a new web store on iOS for video game developers. This was a result of its epic legal victory over Apple, which saw Apple lose its ability to charge “any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app.” An Apple spokesperson has told the press that the company would appeal the ruling.', ""Will there be an announcement at WWDC 2025 about Apple's new stand-alone gaming app?

Previous rumors pointed to iOS 19.4 in spring 2026 as a potential release window."", '', ""Along with iOS 26, we're also expecting to see the 19th version of iPad OS, which will be called iPad OS 26. We expect it to arrive with a slate of updates similar to the iOS system's. It could get the same visual overhaul that iOS 19 receives, but there's also a chance that this could be the year iOS and iPadOS really diverge if Apple decides to move iPadOS closer to its Mac operating system."", ""As someone who has used an iPad as a laptop replacement, I have to admit I'm on board with the latter. While iPadOS shouldn't be completely melted into macOS, it would be nice to have better file management and a more laptop-like interface for using iPads with a Magic Keyboard and a mouse."", 'Aside from visual changes, iPadOS 26 will likely get some of the same updates as iOS 26, including Apple Intelligence updates and AI-powered battery life optimization.', 'We could also see improvements to Stage Manager, which seems especially likely if Apple debuts a more Mac-like iPadOS.', '', ""Another announcement that's a lock for WWDC 2025 is the 16th edition of macOS, which will be called macOS 26,"", ""Apple has consistently given its macOS updates California-themed names over the past several years, and there are still dozens of likely candidates they haven't used, so it's hard to predict which one macOS 26 will get. The possibilities include Redwood, Mammoth, Condor, and Shasta."", 'Regardless of the name, we expect macOS 26 to get a visual overhaul similar to iOS/iPadOS 26. MacOS 26 may look more like its iPhone and iPad counterparts this year, especially if Apple takes inspiration from visionOS. Changes could include circular app icons, translucent windows, and simplified navigation.', 'Additionally, some features from iOS 26 could carry over to macOS, like AI-powered battery optimization and any Apple Intelligence updates.', '', 'While it might not be the star of the show, the Apple Watch is expected to receive an update with the 12th edition of watchOS, which will be called watchOS 26, at WWDC 2025.', ""Like this year's other software updates, this update will feature major visual changes. Those visual updates will probably also include more Apple Intelligence features, which the Watch hasn't seen much of yet. For instance, we might get AI-powered health and fitness tools integrated into watchOS or AI-scripted replies to texts."", ""Of course, the Apple Watch will also be able to take advantage of the upcoming Siri update, but as mentioned above, we might not see that until well into 2026, even if it's announced at this year's WWDC."", 'The Apple Vision Pro has struggled to catch on since it launched in February 2024, but Apple is still diligently supporting it with software updates, which could lead to a rumored pair of smart glasses on the horizon.', ""So, it's no surprise that WWDC 2025 will likely include a look at the third edition of visionOS, which will be called visionOS 26."", 'Interestingly, it sounds like the big visual updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS may have taken some inspiration from visionOS, so this OS might not change as much as the others in the Apple lineup.', 'Even so, it will likely still get a mention in the keynote and possibly a sneak peek at any upcoming apps and movies made for Vision Pro.', '', ""Apple first announced Apple Intelligence at last year's WWDC, so we expect to see Apple spotlight some updates to its struggling AI platform during this year's keynote."", 'Apple Intelligence got off to a rough start this year, with features slow to roll out and the critical Siri overhaul nowhere in sight.', 'Delays with Apple Intelligence even caused a leadership shake-up at Apple, which will hopefully lead to more features and quicker updates, including the promised LLM Siri update.', ""One feature we could see at WWDC 2025 is a rumored feature that uses AI to optimize battery life in iOS 26. This is a refreshingly practical feature that I can see many iPhone users appreciating (myself included). Hopefully, we'll also get a transparent timeline for when to expect the new-and-improved Siri."", ""Hardware announcements at WWDC are hit or miss. WWDC is mainly for software announcements, but Apple occasionally throws a product reveal into the mix, especially if it's a device that doesn't follow Apple's typical pattern of hardware updates."", ""One such device we could see this year is the Mac Pro M4 Ultra. Apple's top-of-the-line Max and Ultra versions of its M-series chip tend to run at least a year or so behind its more mainstream base and Pro versions."", 'We finally got the M3 Ultra in March with the new Mac Studio, but the M4 Ultra is not publicly available yet.', ""It's possible that could change at WWDC this year.

Wild card announcements have happened in the past, like with the Apple Vision Pro.', ""There's a slim chance that this year's presentation could include a sneak peek at a rumored pair of AI smart glasses Apple is developing. Google just unveiled a pair of Android-powered glasses at Google I/O, so this would be a good time for Apple to reveal its own glasses to keep up with the competition."", ""According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple aims to launch its glasses by the end of 2026, so a reveal could be a bit early. It's not impossible, though, especially right after Google I/O."", ""If you can't wait to see what Apple shows off at WWDC 2025, you can watch the keynote presentation live on Apple's website.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence."", 'Apple’s iOS plans: What we’ve heard, in brief', 'Every year in June, we are introduced to the next version of iOS, Apple’s iPhone operating system, during the keynote address that kicks off WWDC (Apple’s worldwide developers conference). During the event Apple will reveal some, or all, of the new features coming to iPhones later in the year.', 'In this article we will run through what we know about the new features coming in the next version of iOS. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that all indications are that it won’t be called iOS 19 this time. Instead Apple will name the new release in line with the year – so expect it to be called iOS 26. More on that below.', 'iOS 26 probably won’t arrive on compatible iPhones until this September, but you don’t have to wait until then to experience the new features. Every year Apple runs a beta-testing program where developers and anyone who signs up for the beta can try out the software before it is released following the Apple iPhone Event in September. If you want to join that beta testing program you will find information about how to do so below, including when the first iOS 26 beta will be available.', 'In summary', 'Our first glimpse of iOS 19 – we should probably just get used to calling it iOS 26 – will be at WWDC25 on June 9, after which the operating system will be in beta until Apple releases it to the public in the fall.', 'Apple typically releases the new version of iOS to the public on the Monday following the launch of the new iPhone. Based on recent history, we expect iOS 19 to release to the public around the time of the on either Monday, September 15, or Monday, September 22.', 'Here are the release dates for the most recent versions of iOS:', 'In summary', 'Apple’s name for the next iOS has always been predictable. iOS 4 was followed by 5, 6, 7 and so on. The current iOS is iOS 18, so the next one will be iOS 19 right? Apparently not! All indications are that iOS 19 won’t be called iOS 19 at all, instead it will be iOS 26.', 'A May 28 story from Bloomberg says Apple is going to unify all its various operating system names/versions, taking a page from car models and using the coming year as a basis. iOS 19 would then be iOS 26, while macOS 16 would be macOS 26, with tvOS 26 and watchOS 26 and visionOS 26…', 'It’s a long overdue change, if true.', 'In summary', 'The full version of iOS 19/iOS 26 will launch in September, but you won’t have to wait until then to try the new software out. Apple’s developer beta and public beta will be running throughout the summer months, so if you want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public you can do so.', 'After Apple announces the new version of iOS at WWDC in June it will then release an iOS Beta to developers. This year the WWDC keynote will take place on June 9 so we expect the developer beta will be available that day. The public beta usually comes a month later, around the beginning of July.', 'Between WWDC and the official release in the fall, Apple will release a string of beta releases, typically eight or so in total. We share details of how to join Apple’s beta software program so you can test the new software as soon as the beta arrives, separately.', 'Anyone using the beta is encouraged to file bug reports using the included Apple’s Feedback Assistant app so that the company can address them. If you want to learn more about the beta read: What’s in the latest iOS beta and how to get it.', 'In summary', 'Three iPhone models are reportedly about to lose iOS support. These are the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max. This rumor comes from an anonymous X account with an impressive track record of accurate predictions. So it may be true.', 'However, there was a report in December 2024 that suggested iOS 19 will be compatible with every iPhone that supports iOS 18. That includes:', 'Of course, it will also support the new iPhone 17 models that will launch around the same time.', 'As always, some features won’t be available on older models, as they lack the hardware resources for it. Apple Intelligence features are already incompatible with all but the iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max and the entire iPhone 16 range, so we don’t expect it to be any different if Apple roles out any more Apple Intelligence related features and enhancements. Check which is the latest iOS version your iPhone can run for more information.', 'In summary', 'While Apple hasn’t officially announced iOS 19/iOS 26 yet, it has been hard at work on the big iPhone upgrade for quite a while and some rumors have started to leak out. It looks like the next version of iOS will be a bigger change than we’re used to, at least visually. Based on the most reliable leaks and rumors, here’s what you can expect when it arrives later this year.', 'All the new features won’t come with that initial release; over the months that follow the initial release more features will be pushed out to iPhones in iOS 19.1, 19.2, and so on. Or…', 'The headline feature of iOS 19/26 (and Apple’s other operating systems iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26) is said to be a massive change to the user interface design. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who seems to be well connected when it comes to this sort of thing, says the star of WWDC will be the new design – code-named Solarium. Apparently, we’re talking about the biggest change since iOS 7, when Apple dropped the skeuomorphic design in favor of flat symbolic icons, changed the lock screen, notifications, and more.', 'We don’t know what this new interface will look like or what interaction changes it will bring with it, but the rumors say it is loosely based on some of the concepts in the Vision Pro interface. Gurman claims it is “is slicker and more modern” due to adopting elements from visionOS. Think circles rather than squares as that seems to be the theme.', 'New apps like Apple Invites and Apple Sports may give us some clues to the interface conventions we can expect, as they don’t have have interfaces that fit in with most of Apple’s older apps.', 'Apple', 'Gurman also says “consistency and unification across the operating systems” will be a major theme of WWDC. Which indicates that there will be more consistency across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, along with a major improvement to the productivity features of iPadOS.', 'For example, one rumor says the iPad will get a menu bar when docked to a Magic Keyboard, and that Stage Manager is being overhauled. The iPhone, meanwhile, is said to get a “Stage Manager like” multi-app view when hooked up to an external display.', 'It’s not just the obvious operating systems either. 9to5Mac reports that CarPlay is getting a UI design to match iOS 26.', 'Want more from WWDC? Be sure to check out video coverage on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. And subscribe to Macworld’s daily and weekly newsletters for Apple coverage, from WWDC to beyond.', 'Apple has been having trouble with some of it’s AI efforts, especially the Siri features that were supposed to come in iOS 18.4 (personal context, screen awareness, and in-app actions). These features have been pushed back until next year, which means they should come as an update to iOS 19 in early 2026.', 'A bigger Siri update, based on large language models (LLMs), that can hold natural conversations with the user, is now so delayed that it is expected to come perhaps as part of iOS 20, where it was once thought to be an update to iOS 19.', 'At least Siri will finally get the new capabilities that we were supposed to have by now. Apple is also said to be expanding the use of Apple Intelligence in more of its apps. We haven’t heard of specific examples, but Apple Intelligence could be used for things like Apple Music playlist generation, suggesting apps in the App Store, or in the Health and Fitness apps.', 'However, we may not hear of any AI-related features at WWDC25. In a late May report, Bloomberg’s Gurman said Apple won’t deliver “any AI breakthroughs” at WWDC.', 'We’ve heard rumors in a few places that Apple is working on a big Stage Manager update for iPad and Mac. From 9to5Mac we get a hint that it might even work on iPhone (if not all the time, then at least with an external display connected).', 'Stage Manager should allow for much more flexible placement and sizing of windows in the new version. For iPads, you might even see a Menu bar when the iPad is docked into a keyboard.', 'Rumors say one of the recurring themes of iOS 19/26 is going to be a number of features that Apple markets as “Powered by Apple Intelligence.” These won’t all be generative-AI features, but rather include many of the sort of AI-powered features Apple has employed for years across its apps.', 'Some Apple Watch features will be promoted this way, though the AI models themselves will run on your iPhone, with the Apple Watch simply serving as your wrist-bound interface to it.', 'Another example is a new battery saving mode that will use AI to analyze your usage patterns to decide when it can lower the power draw of certain applications or features to save battery without impacting the user experience.', 'A new Calendar app based on Mayday app (which Apple acquired last year) relies on AI to help manage your calendar.', '9to5Mac reports that Messages will be able to automatically translate messages using AI. Messages will also let users create polls.', 'Apple’s current implementation of RCS (Rich Communication Services, used to offer more advanced texting features with Android users) is based on the GSMA Universal Profile version 2.4, which is a little dated. Version 2.7 came out last year, but hasn’t been implemented by Apple yet. It adds support for custom emoji reactions, editing and deleting messages, and improved spam handling. RCS 3.0 adds encryption for 1-to-1 messages.', 'Apple has announced support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages on all it’s platforms “in future software updates,” so it is likely to add support for all the features in RCS 2.7 and 3.0 in the iOS 19 cycle.', 'One rumor from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says iOS 19 is going to get “bolstered translation technology” and, as part of it a live translation feature for AirPods. The AirPods will need a firmware update as well, and it’s not clear which models will support the feature.', 'Your AirPods would send text to your iPhone where the foreign language would be recognized and translated in the Translate app (or the under-the-hood service that powers it), and translated audio sent back to your AirPods. Other earbuds have had similar features for years, so it will be interesting to see if Apple goes further or has superior functionality.', 'Apple has announced that several accessibility features will be coming to iOS 19 in the fall. Among the new additions are Accessibility Nutrition Labels let users see whether an app will be accessible to them before they download it; Braille Access, which turns the iPhone into a “full-featured Braille note taker,” and Accessibility Reader, a new reading mode with font, color, and spacing options.', 'With each iteration of the iPhone operating system Apple usually gives some of the included apps some attention, and sometimes introduces new ones. This year the following updates are expected.', 'While not specifically mentioned in any of the current leaks or rumors, we find it hard to believe that Apple won’t have some significant improvements to the Home app, HomeKit, and related services in iOS 19.', 'Why? Well, Apple is expected to release a wave of new smart home products throughout 2025 and 2026. A new Apple smart home hub is first: it’s rumored to be an affordable 7-inch tablet that runs a custom operating system (code-named Pebble). It will support Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and tie in with other Apple services but isn’t expected to have an App Store.', 'After that, likely in 2026, Apple is said to be working on a new indoor smart security camera and a smart doorbell that would use Face ID to unlock your door the way it unlocks your phone. Further down the road, a smart home product with a movable screen on a robotic arm has been rumored, all of which will require deep integration with the iPhone and Home app.', 'The rumored “HomePad” was rumored to launch in the spring of 2025, but was delayed to the fall so it can have an interface that aligns with the big iOS 19 / macOS 15 interface changes. It’s hard to imagine Apple pushing a product like that into the market without some significant changes to the look and feel of the Home app. Read about every new Apple product coming in 2025.', 'Jon Prosser claims to have seen the new Camera app in iOS 19, which is completely redesigned with a somewhat visionOS-inspired design. Options are condensed, the viewfinder takes up more space, and there’s lots of transparency.', 'The Photographic Styles feature may come to video, too.', 'iOS 19 will reportedly include a dedicated gaming app, according to a report from Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The App will also be available for Mac, iPad, and Apple TV, it is claimed.', 'The app is said to tap into the App Store’s games section and Apple Arcade, offer editorial content about new games, and centralize everything currently found in Game Center. The Mac version of the app will “tap into games downloaded outside of the App Store,” according to Gurman. ', '9to5Mac reports that animated album art will now display on the lock screen when using the Music app.', '9to5Mac also reports that users will be able to format their entries in the Notes app by using Markdown syntax.', 'The Health app may get some new features, according to Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in a March newsletter, though these are not expected to be available at launch. Apparently we may get an AI-powered health coach that will give us personalised recommendations and warnings. These could come in the form of videos about healthy eating and heart disease.', 'There’s also a suggestion that we could see food tracking added to the Health app.', 'Jason has written about technology for more than 25 years - first in the gaming press, then focusing on enthusiast PCs and general technology.

You won’t see one on Monday; Apple’s iPhone launch events are typically held in September.)', 'The biggest announcements at WWDC 2025 are potentially a new naming convention and refreshed look for iOS, according to preshow reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

The look might be loosely based on the Vision Pro’s operating system, though it’s unclear exactly how a design tailored for mixed reality could translate to other products such as smartphones and watches.', 'Another Gaming App: Apple may give social gaming another whirl. The company could spin down its current Game Center, launched in 2010, and try again with a new, preinstalled gaming app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV devices.

Now, a new page in the Apple developer website gives a clue as to what the new software might look like. Read about that in the section below on design.', ""After last year's WWDC24, Apple has more up its sleeve for this year."", 'For many iPhone users, the software, thought to be called iOS 26, will make them feel like their existing handset is suddenly a whole new iPhone. Here are the latest details.', 'If you’ve missed the recent news on the renumbering about to take place, reports say that every new OS announced at WWDC will have the same number, referring to the year in which it will mostly be updated: 2026. So, instead of iOS 19, we’ll see iOS 26, alongside watchOS 26, macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and tvOS26. The biggest number leap will come with the Vision Pro, which will jump from visionOS 2 right to visionOS 26. More details of this here.', 'Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman refers to it this way: “This reinforces the unification theme and helps make the naming less confusing for developers and consumers,” and speculates that the 26 is partly because Apple is planning to move to more frequent software updates rather than a big rollout in the fall and that using the number of the upcoming year is “obviously much more forward looking” than 25.', 'It’s just a week until the conference starts, and it seems the software will be designed alongside new versions of iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro and Apple TV operating systems, all designed to be much more similar to each other and provide a more cohesive feel between devices.', 'The internal codename for the software is Solarium, which conjures images of brightness and sunlight — though many codenames are selected at random. Still, if it takes its design cues from the Vision Pro, as has been reported, then there will be a light, translucent look to things.', 'The Prompt: Get the week’s biggest AI news on the buzziest companies and boldest breakthroughs, in your inbox.', '', '', '', 'Now, Apple has shared a new teaser at developer.apple.com, which, as you’d expect, is aimed primarily at developers. The first thing to notice is that the words “On the Horizon,” which decorated the page until now have been replaced with a new legend: “Sleek peek,” which is right in line with Apple’s love for taking a familiar phrase and turning it in a different direction.', ""So, the sneak in sneak peek is replaced by sleek. Clearly, that means that what we're going to see unveiled is something sleek. And as if to prove it, the rainbow image previously found on the page has been replaced with something different."", 'Now, it’s the Apple logo, in three dimensions as though it’s been die-cut out of glass, or Perspex or something else translucent. The colors from the WWDC25 letting underneath are gently reflected up into the base of the Apple logo, again suggesting translucence. In short, it’s exactly the sort of thing you’d expect to see somewhere in the Vision Pro’s design.', 'Meanwhile, Greg Joswiak, Apple’s smoothly accomplished Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing, posted on X. The words were straightforward enough: “WWDC25 is next week! Can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. See you June 9 at 10am PT,” he said. He also put the new WWDC25 hashmoji into the text, but you’ll have to click on the link to see it. That also applies for the animation in the post, which shows the Apple logo morphing first into the Swift logo — that’s Swift, Apple’s coding language — and then into a rainbow.', 'All three have the same translucent glow that looks gorgeous and bodes well.', 'According to Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter, there will be plenty of changes beyond the design update. Expect to see new iPad features to build on its productivity capabilities, making it more like the Mac. Apple is thought to be opening up its Apple Intelligence models to developers, “which will let them integrate the technology into their own apps,” Gurman says.', 'Gurman also says that Apple Intelligence won’t be the center of this year’s WWDC: “The conference may be a letdown from an AI standpoint,” he says, with the focus being on the design and “the basics,” such as making it easy to share Wi-Fi sign-in details across all your devices, “a handy improvement for logging in at gyms and hotels,” he claims. Though — and I don’t mean to be controversial here — shouldn’t you be doing other things at the gym rather than signing into multiple gadgets?', ""It's also reported that there will be an eye-scrolling option for the Vision Pro and a revamped Health app."", 'There’s a lot more to come, including a calligraphy pen for Apple Pencil and live translation for AirPods, but one really stands out for me: an AI-powered battery management set-up, which will make devices last longer between charges.', 'That alone means I can’t wait for the new OS to land.

Is it wrong the iPhone's AI battery management is the only WWDC rumor I'm excited about?,https://www.engadget.com/general/is-it-wrong-the-iphones-ai-battery-management-is-the-only-wwdc-rumor-im-excited-about-143028037.html,"[""Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) kicks off next week — but if I'm honest with myself, I’m struggling to care. I used to watch the shows with eager anticipation as to what new goodies would be coming to my Mac across the next year. But in recent years, a lot of the features highlighted either fell into the bucket marked “wait, you couldn’t do that already?” or the one marked “well, that’s not a thing I’m going to use.”"", 'It doesn’t help the rumored slate of announcements for this year is mostly stuff I know I’m not going to need to engage with. The loudest rumor is a Vision Pro-inspired UI overhaul to bring the iPhone, iPad and Mac in line with their youngest sibling. Consistency is a fine thing to aim for, but Apple is reportedly justifying this change by saying it’s jarring to switch between platforms. I can’t say I’ve ever had an issue, and my concern is Apple will forget that each of those devices is different, and operates in a different way to its stablemates.', 'If a promise is made too often, there’s a risk you’ll stop believing it will ever be fulfilled. Apropos of nothing, Apple’s going to make the iPad more useful as a productivity tool. The rumors hint the slates will get better multitasking and app window management to make it more Mac-esque. But unless iPadOS gets the sort of radical changes that’ll make it operate a lot more like macOS, nothing will change. And I’m doubtful Apple would bring true multitasking to the iPad, lest it eat into Mac sales — not to mention the constraints of its form factor.', ""As someone who is aggressively indifferent toward generative AI and voice assistants, tweaks to Apple Intelligence and Siri leave me similarly cold. I’m not sure I would ever want a gussied up pattern-recognition algorithm writing messages and emails in my voice. Neither am I too into the idea of using generative AI to create images. I'd much rather stay in the real world. Sure, I’m a young man yelling at a cloud, I don’t care."", 'According to Apple, I’m clearly in the minority since the only time I ever engage with Siri is by accident. I can think, type and operate a phone far faster than I can say out loud “Hey Siri, dim my living room lights by 50 percent,” so the slowness of speech irks me. Of course, I’d love a virtual assistant that was as skilled and imaginative as a flesh-and-blood person who could marshal all of my data, organize it and keep me on track. But I don’t believe we’re close to that point, and Apple has failed to deliver on its promises in this area more than once.', 'The only rumored feature that excites me is the “AI-powered” battery management mode for iOS 19 (or 26, as the rumors indicate). I say “AI-powered,” since I’m not sure how much we need to oversell an algorithm that tracks your usage patterns to make power-saving adjustments. But it’s the sort of feature that, if it’s able to make meaningful improvements to the iPhone’s longevity, could be transformative.', 'After all, as a relatively heavy iPhone user, I rarely find my device lasting until the end of the day without a top-up charge. This isn’t a new problem, either, since the iPhone’s battery has been lackluster since the first model was launched in 2007. In a world where most Android handsets boast of multi-day battery life, the iPhone’s battery life remains embarrassing. Yes, you can take that as a not-too-subtle dig at the rumored thin-and-light iPhone Air, which feels to me like the most egregious waste of development resources imaginable.', 'Maybe this is a sign of my subconscious frustration with Apple that it feels so compelled to push forward rather than tidying up behind it. I groused last year that the company gave so much attention to the addition of multitrack recording to Voice Notes despite the feature already being in Garageband. I would love nothing more than Apple to do what it did in 2009 with Snow Leopard and in 2017 with High Sierra. In both of those instances, the company opted to focus on tidying up the existing code to make it smaller and run faster rather than over-extending itself with new features. That, to me, would seem like a far better use of Apple’s time than repainting the home screen with snazzier icons.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9SR3hPZVZOVVRVWkNPVWxKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZcFpZck9MUVk=-w280-h168-p-df

While this year is expected to be a far more low-key event, the majority of the tech giant's operating systems -- including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS -- could get a significant visual revamp alongside a somewhat surprising name change."", ""For those interested in watching WWDC 2025's keynote live, you can stream it on YouTube or directly on Apple's website at 1PM ET/10AM PT on June 9th."", 'The iPhone 17 Air might have a 120Hz display, but not have ProMotion, which is just as baffling as it sounds.', ""Rumors courtesy of Bloomberg's nearly always reliable Mark Gurman point to a substantial overhaul of iOS that draws inspiration from the glass-like look of visionOS, the operating system that powers Apple's beleaguered mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro. The return of Windows Aero that I've been waiting for has finally arrived, just not in the way that I expected."", ""Along with the new transparent look, a report from Front Page Tech's Jon Prosser hints that almost rounded icons could be coming to the mobile OS' home screen and Control Center. Other more subtle changes are on the way, too, including a new tab view in apps, and the Messages search box location shifting."", ""While not a lot of specifics have leaked, it's expected that all of Apple's operating systems, including iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and more, will adopt this new look in an effort to unify their design language. It will be interesting to see how quickly third-party developers adapt to this aesthetic shift, because if it isn't picked up quickly, it'll lead to a disjointed visual experience. Remember when Apple ditched the home button with the iPhone X and not all third-party apps immediately supported the swipe gesture in their UI? iOS 11 was a mess on the phone for the first few months."", 'It also looks like Apple could be working on a dedicated gaming app to replace its Game Center platform across all of its platforms.', ""On top of the visual refresh, Apple is rumored to be changing the naming scheme of its operating systems. Instead of iOS 19, we'll be getting iOS 26, alongside iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and more. macOS will likely still receive a California-themed name as well (rumors point to Tahoe), but my guess is it will also be known as macOS 26."", ""Beyond the new look and name refresh, details are sparse on potential new features across Apple's operating systems. That said, Bloomberg reports that a new AI-powered battery management mode is coming to iOS 26. This feature will reportedly make power-saving adjustments based on how you use your smartphone. As far as AI-powered features go, this has the potential to be pretty useful if it works well. It also looks like Apple could be working on a dedicated gaming app to replace its Game Center platform across all of its platforms."", ""Don't expect to hear a lot about Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2025 next week."", 'The more personalized Siri Apple promised at WWDC 2024 still hasn\'t arrived, and it\'s been months since the tech giant told Daring Fireball that ""It\'s going to take us longer than we thought"" to release the upgraded assistant.', ""Will we hear more about Apple's fancy AI-powered Siri at this year's WWDC? If The Information's latest report is accurate, probably not, as the project is reportedly still nowhere near ready. That said, Bloomberg reports that we'll see a few more subtle Siri updates, including the ability to use Gemini instead of ChatGPT with the assistant. New Apple Intelligence AI features are on the way, though, including blending two Genmoji (I'm not sure why anyone would want to do that) and built-in live translation for calls and texts."", 'Ahead of WWDC 2025, Apple has confirmed that the majority of compatible iPhones are running the latest version of its mobile OS.', ""While Apple has revealed hardware at WWDC keynotes in the past to give the developer event a consumer angle, that probably won't be the case this year."", ""That means we won't catch a glimpse of the often-rumored, super-thin iPhone 17 Air or the refreshed Mac Pro, which is overdue for an update. It's likely we'll hear more about the Mac Pro later this summer and that the iPhone 17 Air will be part of Apple's big fall hardware keynote."", ""I've gone over to the fidelity-filled dark side, and don't think I can go back."", 'We want to hear from you!
