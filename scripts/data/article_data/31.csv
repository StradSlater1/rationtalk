We're starting with the next-generation version of macOS, which Apple is apparently going to call macOS Tahoe."", '', 'Since the current version of macOS is macOS 15, it would normally be followed by macOS 16, but Apple is changing its naming scheme for operating system updates starting this year.', 'Everything coming out in 2025 will be numbered with a ""26"" to reflect its release season, covering the period between September 2025 and September 2026. We\'re getting macOS 26, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. Apple could have gone with 25 because that\'s the year of launch, but 26 technically does make more sense because there are more months in 2026 where we\'ll have the 26 series of updates installed.', ""With the streamlined naming that Apple is implementing, there won't be a need to remember separate, confusing numbers for each operating system. It might be confusing at first for people to go from macOS 15 to macOS 26, but it should make more sense over the long haul."", 'macOS is special because it always gets a California landmark name along with its number, unlike other operating systems. This year, it looks like Apple is going to go with ""Tahoe,"" a popular lake between California and Nevada. Lake Tahoe is a popular vacation destination all year long, but particularly in the winter where it is known for its ski slopes.', 'Tahoe will join the other California landmark names that Apple has used, including Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia.', ""Most of the rumors that we've heard about Apple's upcoming software have focused on \u200ciOS 26\u200c and the design changes that Apple has planned, but macOS 26 is going to get some of those same design updates."", 'The revamp might not be quite as dramatic, but Apple wants to have a more cohesive look and feel across its operating systems, hence the design overhaul and the ""26"" name change.', '', '', 'App icons that have a more rounded look could happen, and we could see rounder corners for windows and other interface elements. Apple could also adopt some floating menu bars, and add more depth to everything for a glossier look and feel.', '', '', ""There are new Apple Intelligence features coming in macOS 26, but Apple is undoubtedly going to be more reserved about announcing anything that's not ready to go."", 'Apple plans to update the Shortcuts app to integrate \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c. Users will be able to create actions that use \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c models, which should make it easier for casual users to create useful shortcuts.', ""Apple might give us some insight into when Siri will be able to integrate with Gemini in addition to ChatGPT, because that's a feature coming soon."", ""All those personalized \u200cSiri\u200c features that Apple announced at WWDC 2024 are going to come in \u200ciOS 26\u200c and macOS 26 at some point, but it's not clear if they'll be ready by WWDC. If they're not ready to go, Apple probably won't mention them, and we'll get them later in the year."", ""As a reminder, we're waiting on personal context that lets \u200cSiri\u200c keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, or basically anything on your device. Apple is also adding onscreen awareness so \u200cSiri\u200c can help you with what's on your screen, and \u200cSiri\u200c will also get deeper app integration so that it can do more in and across apps."", ""There's a new game app in the works that'll be available for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. It'll have the games you'd normally find in the App Store and Apple Arcade titles, along with sections for in-game achievements, leaderboards, and editorial content."", ""You'll be able to use the app to communicate with other people, and on the Mac, it'll be able to tap into games downloaded outside of the Mac App Store. It'll replace Game Center, and will be a more feature rich app."", 'Apple previewed several Accessibility features that are coming in macOS 26 and \u200ciOS 26\u200c, plus there have been rumors of new Wi-Fi features.', 'macOS Tahoe could drop support for some older Macs, including the 2018 MacBook Pro, the 2019 iMac, the 2017 \u200ciMac\u200c Pro, the 2018 Mac mini, and the 2020 Intel-based MacBook Air.

These two macOS 26 features would transform the way I use my Mac,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/these-two-macos-26-features-would-transform-the-way-i-use-my-mac/,"['Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?', 'Apple’s execution with note-taking on macOS leaves a lot of room for improvement. There are so many areas where it feels like an abandoned project, instead of the future-proof experience that native iOS apps often deliver. In fact, the disparity across its own platforms is troubling. ', 'Take, for example, iPadOS and iOS. You can quickly launch a notes page straight from the control, without having to close the existing app and launch the Notes app. On macOS, you don’t get any such facility. ', 'If you want to seamlessly save a webpage or its contents as a standalone note, there are a few hurdles. For web-based workflow, you must use the Safari browser, because only in Apple’s browser does the Share Sheet offer a quick notes shortcut. Otherwise, trigger the Notes app with a keyboard shortcut.', 'Why won’t Apple put a Quick Notes button in the control center, or implement it in the Menu Bar, is simply perplexing. The whole concept of burdening users with another app window, when there is a solution waiting to be activated, also puzzles me.', 'I’ve often focused on the missed opportunity that is macOS’ Menu Bar. On the other hand, the open-source and indie-developer community has created so many lightweight and deeply practical utilities that live predominantly as a Menu Bar app. ', 'Maccy, for example, solves the native clipboard problem on Macs elegantly. Antinote is another stunning app that I use daily. For saving information, I rely on the excellent Sticky Notes for Safari app that tags all my takeaways wherever I want on a webpage. ', 'A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon BarNotes. It’s a neat app that essentially serves as a scratchpad and lives in the Menu Bar. It has been designed in the same aesthetic format as a native Apple app. ', 'As far as functional depth goes, you can adjust the font size, pick between four styles, and change the notepad color. I like the “transparent” effect, as it sits well with Apple’s own glassmorphic design elements that first arrived with macOS Big Sur. ', 'It doesn’t burden you with too many features that aren’t required from a digital scratchpad, and also strips all the stylistic formatting when you paste your content, which is a convenient touch. The best part? BarNotes is free and available on the App Store, which means you don’t have to worry about the security aspect, either. ', 'Tab Notes Lite is another free app that lives in the Menu Bar and offers a few extra goodies. It lets you click on the screen’s edge to take a note, pick up the local storage folder, and offers customizable shortcuts, as well. There are a whole bunch of paid apps, too, but I recommend sticking with the free options if they get the job done. ', 'The best place for AI is the low-stakes scenario where it can handle the task at hand with minimal scope for correction. Like asking it to compose a quick note in a formal tone, convert the file format, or send it as an email. The kind of tasks Google Gemini can currently handle, and so can Apple Intelligence. ', 'The major hurdle, however, is the platform-wide implementation. For example, the AI-powered Writing Tools system doesn’t always work reliably, especially within third-party software. For example, when writing a paper in Docs on Chrome, a right-click doesn’t show Writing Tools in the context menu. ', 'To use it, you must copy-paste the text passage in the Notes app and then repeat the process to perform an AI-driven task, such as proofreading, style conversion, and summarization. If there were a Menu Bar shortcut for Notes, users wouldn’t have to do a back-and-forth between two apps in order to get the best of Apple Intelligence.', 'I would love for Apple to put Notes within the Menu Bar and make Writing Tools a crucial part of it. Then there is the situation with integration. Gemini will seamlessly perform tasks across Gmail, Maps, Drive, and Calendar, among other apps, using text and/or voice input. Apple Intelligence, despite its ChatGPT integration, can’t do any of that, yet. ', 'It was only last week that ChatGPT gained the ability to access files in your Google Drive, among other cloud storage services such as Dropbox, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Box. Moreover, the rumored Gemini integration within Apple Intelligence is nowhere to be seen. I dearly hope WWDC 2025 can offer some clarity on that front. ', 'And while at it, Apple should add some quickly accessible voice input features, as well. Narrating a quick idea instead of having to type it out, and then getting a transcribed version (with summaries) would go a long way toward boosting day-to-day productivity.', 'With Notes’ arrival in macOS Menu Bar, supercharged by Apple Intelligence and meaningful integration with other services, users won’t have to jump between different apps, or even pay money for basic third-party software. Apple must fill these fundamental gaps, and I am dearly hoping that the company pays attention to this aspect at its developers conference.', 'I have missed more transitory ideas than I can count while absorbed in work. Or missed deadlines. Or forgot minor chores. On a few occasions, I was just too lazy to reach out for my iPhone, open a to-do app, create a new page, and type in. You feel the flow here, right?', 'On other occasions, I just lost my train of thought mid-way through it all. Often, an app just doesn’t have the functions I need for that fleeting, low-stakes note-taking job. Then there’s the load of “yet another app” taking up precious screen space. ', 'Apple’s approach to Mac computing is rather odd. The unwavering focus on simplicity, fluidity, and elegance sets it apart from Windows. But at the same time, it can feel a lot restrictive. Nothing exemplifies that better than app windows in macOS.', 'Until macOS Sequoia, Apple didn’t even offer proper window tiling and snapping options. Windows has served them for a while now, and in a fashion that even power users would approve. ', 'I recently found myself assisting my sister with a research project. Writing a science paper is a notoriously taxing process because it is excruciatingly drab to write one,  but at the same time, you have to be meticulous with every single statement. Citations are a crucial element, and depending on the topic you have picked, you may have to sprinkle a few links in every line.', '', 'Upgrade your lifestyle\nDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUhNM1Z1WkRocFFXMW1abk5sVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhRmdKREZ2QWM=-w280-h168-p-df
Apple’s Spotlight upgrades look like a power-user dream,https://www.theverge.com/apple/682950/apple-spotlight-mac-shortcuts,"['A launcher that can launch, and do, almost anything on your Mac. Awesome.', '', 'This year’s WWDC is shaping up to be surprisingly focused on power users. There are lots of new personalization ideas, plenty of new ways to move things around on your device, and some new ways to get things done. But Mac power users in particular are going to really fall for two things: the new Spotlight, and the new Shortcuts.', 'In macOS Tahoe, Spotlight, the universal search and launcher feature you open with Command+Space, can now do more than just open stuff. It can do stuff. Apps can provide access for Spotlight to execute all kinds of actions, from playing music and podcasts to creating notes or adding to files. You can find actions with search or with short keyboard shortcuts — onstage at WWDC, Apple’s Craig Federighi demonstrated using “sm” to quickly send a message.', 'Beyond that, it sounds a bit like Apple wants to make Spotlight the go-to way to access anything on your device. You’ll be able to search through both the things on your device and the things in your cloud storage, with lots of filtering options; there’s even a browsing view that looks a bit like the App Library on an iPhone or iPad. (Spotlight can also search all the apps on those devices, too, if you have mirroring set up.) If you’re in an app, you can open Spotlight and use it to search through all the menu options in the app.', 'True power users won’t be blown away by these features, because they’ve been using them for years. Apps like Raycast and Alfred have been popular for years, and have long offered this kind of simple navigation and shortcut access. Once you get used to one of these tools, there’s simply no going back. Now Apple’s trying to ship a slightly more mainstream version to Mac users everywhere. (The folks behind Alfred and Raycast will, uh, not be thrilled by today’s announcement.)', 'Apple Intelligence is also potentially making Shortcuts better. With macOS Tahoe, you’ll be able to access various AI models through the app — including ChatGPT — to accomplish whatever you’re trying to do automatically. More exciting: you can now set Shortcuts to run automatically on your Mac, either at a specific time of day or when you do something specific. (I’m already imagining the one I’ll set up to turn on my lights, change sound settings, and close the blinds every time I open my app for recording podcasts.) Shortcuts is still too complicated for many users, but it’ll be able to do much more for those who do the work.', 'In recent years it has often felt like longtime Mac users were being left behind, as Apple looked for ways to hook new users and integrate the glitzy new technology of the moment. It’s nice to see Apple going deep on a feature its most dedicated users use all the time.', 'Related:', '', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

macOS Tahoe 26 will bring Apple's new Liquid Glass UI to your desktop,https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html,"[""So long macOS Sequoia, hello macOS Tahoe 26. Apple's next desktop operating system will feature the company's Liquid Glass UI, but at this point, it doesn't look like there will be any truly transformative features like last year's iPhone mirroring. But hey, at least Apple isn't trying to make us excited about widgets again. Just like the rest of Apple's new software, Tahoe's version number has also been updated to reflect the upcoming year — previously, we expected it to be macOS 16. While that may take some getting used to, it's easier than trying to remember the different version numbers across Apple's platforms."", 'At first glance, Apple\'s Liquid Glass refresh almost seems like a rehash of the ""Aero"" design Microsoft used in Windows Vista (which came out nearly 20 years ago, yikes). True to its name, a varying degree of transparency is key to Apple\'s new aesthetic — that includes a fully transparent menu bar, as well new light and dark tints for those respective display modes. Basically, it looks like macOS Tahoe will be Apple\'s most customizable desktop OS yet.', ""As for genuinely new features, macOS Tahoe 26 finally brings the Phone app to Apple's PCs, which also includes the new app design that's coming to iOS 26. Previously, you had to launch calls from the Messages or Facetime apps. You'll also be able to see Live Activities from your phone in the menu bar, so it'll be easier to keep track of an upcoming delivery order or Uber ride."", ""Apple says that macOS Tahoe 26 will also feature the biggest update ever to Spotlight, its search function. You'll be able to search across just about everything on your system — files, apps, messages — with a single query. You can also narrow your queries down in a few ways, like limiting results to PDFs. Spotlight can also search third-party cloud storage, according to Apple. It'll be interesting to see how that integration works, and if there's any noticeable lag time when it comes to searching the cloud."", 'Spotlight will also have ""hundreds"" of actions built-in, so you can do something like send an email or start a podcast without jumping into multiple apps. Squint, and it looks like Spotlight could become the centerpiece of how you interact with your Mac once Apple Intelligence AI features get smarter. For power users, Apple is also introducing ""Quick Keys"": short strings of letters that can immediately launch specific functions.', ""In a demo during the WWDC keynote, an Apple representative was able to launch a document via Spotlight and then add an image just by searching through Spotlight. You'll also be able to see the history of items copied to your clipboard with Spotlight, which will surely be handy for those times where you lose track of an item you've copied."", ""Just like iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26 will also feature a dedicated Games app, which will show off all the titles installed on your system. Similarly, Apple Intelligence upgrades are coming to all of Apple's platforms, including Live Translations in the Messages app, as well as new Genmoji and Image Playground features. That includes new art styles, like vector art and oil paintings."", 'As for other small updates, Safari and the Photos app are also getting redesigned with new Liquid Glass highlights. While Safari gets a more useful upgrade on iOS 26, where it can take over the entire iPhone screen, the transparent location bar could still be useful on Macs.', ""Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference kicked off yesterday, June 9.

That means if you own one of these Macs, you'll still get access to all the features in the update later this fall when macOS Tahoe launches. The only exception is that anything that relies on Apple Intelligence won't be available, as those features are restricted to Apple Silicon machines."", ""It's been five years since the beginning of the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon. At the time, Apple stated that it would “continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come.” Intel-based Macs older than 2019 have already stopped receiving software updates, and it's now time for the last generation of models to get removed from the list."", ""Fortunately, Apple will provide security upgrades for these Intel-based Macs for three more years. That's pretty solid for machines that are already more than five years old."", ""I've recommended against buyers purchasing Intel-based Macs for years. The jump from Intel Macs to even the initial M1 Macs is a huge leap in terms of performance and battery life, though I'm sure some folks will have been seduced by the Intel Macs' ultra-discounted prices in recent years. Now we know for sure where the end of the road is, which will hopefully convince some to at least buy an M1 MacBook Air."", ""Apple will also be winding down Rosetta, the company's emulation layer for running non-native apps on Apple Silicon. It was key to Apple's early success in transitioning to its own chips. For anything other than old games, the software provided by Apple will be available only through macOS 26 and macOS 27.

The Phone app in macOS 26 is another baby step towards a cellular Mac,https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-phone-app-in-macos-26-is-another-baby-step-towards-a-cellular-mac-220854738.html,"['While it still remains more of a dream than an obvious stop on Apple’s product roadmap, the company’s updates in macOS Tahoe 26 offer new evidence that Apple could one day sell Macs with cellular connectivity. Sure, the biggest takeaway from WWDC 2025 will probably be the new Liquid Glass design language the company is sprinkling over all of its operating systems, but based on the addition of a Phone app to macOS, Apple’s laptops and phones are converging in more ways than one.', 'The new Phone app, which combines recent phone calls, favorite contacts and voicemails all in one interface, will offer the same features in both iOS and macOS. That’s a first for Apple’s desktop operating system, which has a FaceTime app, but otherwise primarily interacts with phone calls through Continuity features. Currently, iPhone calls can be relayed and answered on a Mac, and you can place calls from the FaceTime app, but it’s far from intuitive. That should change in macOS 26. The Phone app lets you make calls, listen to voicemails and even use new features like Hold Assist as easily as you would on an iPhone.', 'Every year Apple nudges its platforms together, like letting you access your iPhone from your desktop with iPhone Mirroring or use your iPhone as a webcam with Continuity Camera. But porting apps directly from the iPhone feels like a more significant step. On iPad, which is sold in Wi-Fi and Cellular configurations, adding the Phone app (as Apple is with iPadOS 26) makes sense. The iPhone and iPad share a lot of similarities from both a software and hardware perspective. The Mac does not — at least, not yet.', 'In December 2024, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was ""investigating the idea of bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac."" Apple has been trying to move away from relying on Qualcomm’s cellular modems for years. The company bought Intel’s smartphone modem team in pursuit of that idea in 2019, and debuted the iPhone 16e, its first device with a custom Apple C1 modem, earlier this year. A cellular Mac seems like a perfect opportunity to put future versions of that modem, say a C2 or C3, to the test.', 'Even with better multitasking, there’s still plenty of tasks that are easier on a Mac than on an iPad. A cellular Mac could let you upload a professionally edited video out in the field, or communicate with your team without having to be tethered to a Wi-Fi hotspot. Both are possible on an iPad, but would feel more natural on a Mac.', ""Gurman suggests the company wouldn’t try to bring its custom modem to devices other than the iPhone until 2026 at the earliest, but Apple could be laying the groundwork from a software perspective right now. Macs already use Apple’s custom chips, and they’ll soon feature software that’s increasingly similar to the iPhone. All that's missing is a modem that can connect to cellular networks."", ""Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference kicked off yesterday, June 9.
