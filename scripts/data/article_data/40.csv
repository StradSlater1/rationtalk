Diddy trial recap: Ex-aide Mia says Diddy assaulted Cassie at Brad Pitt movie premiere,https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/06/02/diddy-trial-live-updates-day-18/83979375007/,"['This page reflects the news from Sean ""Diddy"" Combs\' trial on Monday, June 2. For the latest updates from Diddy\'s trial, read USA TODAY\'s live coverage for Tuesday, June 3.', 'This story contains graphic descriptions that some readers may find disturbing.', 'As Sean ""Diddy"" Combs\' federal sex-crimes trial continues, his lawyers pushed back against sweeping abuse allegations and grilled the rapper\'s former assistant.', 'The woman, going by the pseudonym ""Mia,"" spent days last week telling jurors about his alleged physical and sexual abuse. But Combs\' attorneys pressed her on warm text messages she sent in recent years and social media posts she shared about her former boss.', '""I was still brainwashed,"" Mia explained on the stand in Manhattan court on June 2, saying she was ""constantly seeking"" Combs\' approval.', 'Similar to other former employees, Mia has described a workplace dynamic in which Combs allegedly made repeated threats to maintain control. The ex-assistant, who worked for Combs from 2009-2017, also claims the Bad Boy Records founder sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions.', 'Combs, 55, was arrested in September 2024 and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.', ""Mia said she spoke to Cassie Ventura Fine, Combs' ex-girlfriend, around the time of her bombshell 2023 lawsuit, in which she accused Combs of sex trafficking and abuse. Mia never mentioned to Ventura Fine that Combs had also allegedly sexually assaulted her, she said."", '""I was still deeply ashamed and wanted to die. I didn\'t want to tell anybody,"" she testified.', '""Why did it take seven to eight months for you to tell the U.S. Attorney\'s Office about Sean Combs supposedly sexually assaulting you?"" Combs\' defense attorney Brian Steel asked.', 'It is not uncommon for sexual assault survivors to wait some time before revealing their experiences to loved ones or law enforcement.', 'Mia\'s testimony turned emotional as she was asked whether she was able to speak about Combs allegedly assaulting her without looking down while she addressed the court. Mia said she couldn\'t: ""It’s the worst thing I\'ve ever had to talk about in my life,"" she shared.', ""Mia was then asked why she chose to speak out now. She explained that she felt she couldn't help her loved ones, including her niece and goddaughters, if they were ever sexually assaulted and she had never raised her accusations against Combs."", 'The former assistant alleged during her testimony last week that the first time Combs sexually assaulted her was at the Plaza Hotel, when they were in New York City celebrating his 40th birthday in 2009.', 'In later years, Combs allegedly assaulted her several additional times, including at his Los Angeles home and on a private plane. Mia cried as she described the alleged attacks.', 'Steel continued to ask Mia why she never told family or friends about the assaults. She said she had to be in constant communication with Combs 24/7, and even when she was away, ""I was never out of his grip.""', '""You joined the MeToo money grab against Mr. Combs, is that true?"" Steel added, asking whether she knew that Ventura Fine had received settlement money in her lawsuit against Combs. Mia said she was aware of the settlement, but she doesn\'t want to sue Combs for monetary gain.', '""No, that is not my intention,"" she replied. He pressed, ""You want money from Mr. Combs based on your testimony, is that right?""', '""No,"" Mia said.', 'Jurors saw texts from 2019, in which Mia wrote to Combs: ""I had a nightmare. I was trapped in an elevator with R. Kelly and you came to rescue me."" Kelly, a fellow hip-hop artist, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in 2022. Combs is currently facing both charges.', '""Why are you reaching out to Mr. Combs, telling him this?"" Steel asked Mia, pressing her on why, if Combs allegedly terrorized her, she would write to him in such a way.', '""Puff used to be my protector,"" she replied, adding that Combs, sometimes referred to as ""Puff Daddy,"" had recently lost longtime partner Kim Porter. ""Kim had just passed away, and I felt horrible for him,"" she said. Porter died in 2018 from pneumonia.', 'Noting that the text came months after Porter\'s death, Steel said: ""It\'s five months later, and you are having thoughts that he\'s your savior, and you\'re sending him all the love in the world?"" She replied that she didn’t think five months was a long time frame, explaining that Combs would grieve Porter, with whom he shares four children, for a lifetime.', 'Mia testified that Combs had stolen both her and Ventura Fine\'s devices on multiple occasions, and he put tracking devices on Ventura Fine\'s car. ""I\'m not sure what he\'s capable of,"" she said.', 'But Steel quickly pressed Mia on an instance in which Ventura Fine had come to her, saying that Combs was acting ""jerky."" Mia responded by saying his ""brain needed to be rewired,"" comparing him to a child throwing tantrums who needs his mother.', '""Why would you stick up for Mr. Combs?"" Steel asked, but Mia denied wanting to defend her former boss.', '""One of the worst parts"" of her job was being put in the middle of Ventura Fine and Combs’ relationship, she said, which Cassie has alleged was fraught with physical and sexual abuse. ""I wouldn’t lie to her about anything I wasn\'t forced to,"" she added.', 'Steel questioned Mia about a friendly text message exchange with Combs from 2020, years after her employment with him ended. ', 'At the time, Mia texted Combs that she had ""so many funny"" memories, as well as videos and notes on her phone depicting warm moments. Combs replied, ""I love it. Glad you\'re well,"" adding, ""I only remember the good times."" Mia wrote back, ""Love you too, and the only things to remember are the good times, and those are the only ones I have.""', 'Steel asked Mia why she did not respond to Combs by saying, ""Well, I remember the bad times."" Steel argued she should have told the rapper that he ""should remember what you did to me,"" in light of her violent allegations against him.', 'But Mia said on the stand, ""No, I would never respond that way."" Steel shot back that this is ""because it’s not true,"" but Mia maintained that she has ""never lied in this courtroom, and I will never lie in this courtroom."" She continued, ""I was still brainwashed,"" noting that she was ""constantly seeking"" Combs\' approval.', 'Mia also testified that Combs ""threatened to tell Cassie everything,"" referring to Combs\' allegedly sexually assaulting her. The former assistant said the threats ""made me feel like I had done something wrong. I can\'t explain what that does to a person.""', 'In a May 14, 2020, text, Mia told Combs: ""Puff, my heart is broken about Dre,"" seemingly about the late Uptown Records founder Andre Harrell.', 'In a message from August 2020, Mia texted Combs, ""Thinking of you with Chadwick Boseman,"" following the actor\'s death. Mia said on the stand that Combs was ""auditioning for the role"" of James Brown in the ""Get On Up"" biopic that Boseman ended up playing, and she said she texted Combs saying that she had his audition tape and would send it to him.', 'In other texts to Combs, Mia went on to describe some of their ""magical, hilarious"" and ""hysterical"" memories together: One was of a night in Paris when Mick Jagger apparently flirted with her; another was of a night when Jennifer Lopez wouldn\'t stay out with them; yet another was of a high-stakes poker game between Combs and Leonardo DiCaprio.', 'In the text message, she wrote that Combs said, while cursing: ""That \'Titanic\' (guy) doesn\'t know (anything). He won $10,000, I won $650,000.""', 'As former assistant Mia\'s testimony continued on June 2, she alleged that in 2012, she witnessed a discussion between Combs and Ventura Fine escalate at the premiere of the Brad Pitt film ""Killing Them Softly,"" during the Cannes Film Festival in France.', ""She claimed she saw Combs grit his teeth while digging his nails into Ventura Fine's arm, and eventually insisted that Ventura Fine leave, which she did."", ""As Combs' trial stretches into another week, several new names will take the stand."", 'Among the expected witnesses are Enrique Santos and Frank Piazza, whose connection to Combs remains unclear.', 'Two employees of the InterContinental Hotel, where video captured the music mogul assaulting Ventura Fine, are also expected to take the stand. Hotel security supervisor Eddie Garcia will testify under immunity, and hotel custodian Sylvia Okun is also expected to speak out.', 'During cross-examination on May 30, Steel showed Mia a number of old social media posts. One was a tribute for Combs\' 45th birthday, where she wrote, ""Happy birthday, Puff Daddy. Thank you for being the good kind of crazy,"" adding that she loved him with all her heart. Steel remarked that this was five years after Combs first allegedly sexually assaulted her.', '""When the highs were high and the goods were good, you tried so hard to stay in that,"" Mia said. Steel pressed her multiple times, saying, ""Haven\'t you said you\'ve been sexually assaulted so many times that you can\'t even remember?"" Mia responded: ""I don\'t remember phrasing it that way.""', '50 Cent is looking to give President Donald Trump his two cents about Combs. In an Instagram post on May 30, the ""In da Club"" rapper said he\'ll reach out to Trump after the president said he would ""look at the facts"" in Combs\' case, suggesting a pardon could be on the table.', '50 Cent shared a clip of the president\'s comments in his post and wrote that Combs ""said some really bad things about Trump,"" adding that he will ""reach out so he knows how I feel about this guy.""', 'In a follow-up post, 50 Cent suggested Combs\' past comments about Trump could prevent a potential pardon. ""Donald doesn\'t take well to disrespect, and doesn\'t forget who chooses to go against him,"" he wrote. He also shared a screenshot of an article suggesting he was trying to ""nuke"" Combs\' chances of pardon, clarifying, ""I didn\'t say I would nuke anything, I simply said I will make sure Trump is aware.""', ""No, despite recently handing down a flurry of pardons, including one for reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, Trump did not include Combs on that list. But that doesn't mean he can't. According to Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt, Trump would be within his presidential rights to extend a preemptive pardon to Combs."", '""These are federal charges so that\'s the main limit,"" Kalt tells USA TODAY. ""The matter has (to) be federal, it has to be criminal vs. civil, and related to something that\'s already been done. But the person doesn\'t have to even be charged yet or convicted. The Supreme Court has said preemptive pardons are OK.""', 'When asked about a possible pardon during an Oval Office press conference on May 30, Trump said he hadn\'t been approached about the legal matter but added, ""I know people are thinking about it.""', 'Combs is facing federal sex-crimes and trafficking charges in a sprawling lawsuit that has eroded his status as a power player and kingmaker in the entertainment industry.', 'He was arrested in September 2024 and later charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

"Diddy trial recap
Hotel security worker says Sean Combs paid 100K for assault video of Cassie",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2025/06/03/diddy-trial-live-updates-sean-combs-witness-testimony/,"['Sean “Diddy” Combs paid $100,000 to obtain what he thought was the only copy of a 2016 video showing him beating his girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway, according to Eddy Garcia, a hotel security worker who testified on Day 15 of the hip-hop mogul’s sex-trafficking trial.', 'The government says that video supports its case that Ventura was forced by Combs to have sex with male escorts as part of “freak-offs” held at various hotels. The defense has countered that Ventura was a consensual and willing participant in the sex parties. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, and faces up to life in prison if convicted.', 'A number of government witnesses are expected to testify Tuesday. Jane, an alias for another alleged sex-trafficking victim who used to be romantically involved with Combs, is expected to take the stand later this week.', 'Follow Music', 'Judge Arun Subramanian went into his robing room to talk with representatives for the U.S. Marshals Service about some of the issues raised by Sean Combs’s defense. Lead counsel Marc Agnifilo has been vociferous — in his very genteel way — about wanting to spend more time with Combs to review the prosecution’s evidence. He has asked if they could do so in the courthouse after hours, instead of at the jail.', 'Prosecutor Maurene Comey noted that the defense has had access to this evidence for months. After returning to the courtroom, Subramanian said Combs and his attorney can use the courtroom — under supervision by U.S. Marshalls — until 6 p.m. today.', 'And with that, court is over for the day.', 'Marc Agnifilo, the lead defense counsel, pleaded with the court for more time before a new witness begins testifying against Sean Combs later this week. The witness, using the alias Jane, is expected to be on the stand for multiple days, and the defense wants time to ask Combs about a huge volume of evidence that will accompany her testimony, including sensitive communications and nude images that Combs cannot look at without an attorney or paralegal present.', 'Agnifilo has complained that the Brooklyn jail where Combs is housed is inadequate for trial preparation and violates his client’s constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial. The judge said he will ask the marshals service if they can allow Combs and his legal team to confer in the courtroom for a few hours after trial lets out each day.', 'Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo ended the day’s testimony cross on an awkward note. After a series of questions that painted Sean Combs’s business empire as extremely well organized, he asked former CFO Derek Ferguson, “Do you think highly of Combs?”', 'You could have heard a pin drop as Ferguson took a lengthy pause. “I don’t know how to respond to that,” he said.', 'Ferguson then left the stand, and the jury was sent home for the afternoon.', 'Before adjourning for the day, the court discussed the upcoming testimony of Jane, a former girlfriend of Sean Combs who the government says was sex-trafficked by him. Jane, who is using a court-approved pseudonym to protect her privacy, is expected to take the stand this week.', 'The government wants the courtroom video feed turned off while Jane is on the stand, because it will display exhibits that include her real name and that of her son. (The volume of documents is so great that names cannot be redacted in time, prosecutors say.)', 'It seems closed-circuit video of Jane’s testimony will be shown in the overflow room for the public and the press room.', 'It makes sense that defense attorney Marc Agnifilo would spend some time cross-examining Derek Ferguson about his perspective on Sean Combs. Ferguson worked with Combs for nearly 20 years in various parts of his business empire, serving as chief financial officer for Bad Boy Entertainment and later a chief executive at Combs’s media company Revolt. Testifying under a subpoena, he is the first Combs employee at the trial to say he never saw Combs be violent or break the law.', '“Did you see anyone commit crimes?” Agnifilo asked. “Did you see anyone make the company stronger through threats of violence?” Ferguson said he had not.', '“Did you see anyone enhance Combs’ reputation … through prostitution?” the lawyer asked. “No,” said Ferguson.', 'Tuesday afternoon’s testimony from former Bad Boy CFO Derek Ferguson is certainly dry compared to this morning, when a hotel guard described Combs pulling $100,000 in cash out of a brown paper bag to buy a surveillance video in which he was caught brutally attacking his girlfriend Cassie Ventura.', 'If there was one nonlawyer in the courtroom who remained fully engaged while Ferguson discussed financial details and expense reports, it was Combs himself.

The debate is central to the racketeering charges against Combs: Did he use his business network as a tool for extortion, or run it legitimately?', 'Under cross-examination, Ferguson testified that a team went through expense statements each month, determining what was for business and what was personal. “For your entire time, 19 years,” asked lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, “ … did anyone not pay the taxes they were supposed to pay, or do something that they were not supposed to?” Ferguson said he never would have intentionally allowed fraud at the company.', 'Sean Combs’s highly profitable deal to promote Cîroc Vodka and DeLeon Tequila soured because Combs felt the beverage company, Diageo, was only using his ads in Black and minority neighborhoods, his former chief financial officer Derek Ferguson testified.', 'Combs filed a lawsuit against Diageo alleging discriminatory business practices, which was settled in 2024. Ferguson was discussing the matter on cross-examination when prosecutors objected to the line of questioning, which ties into the defense’s theory that many people treat Combs unfairly due to his race, including the government in their prosecution of him.', 'Derek Ferguson is back on the stand, as lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo uses the financial executive’s cross-examination to paint a positive picture of Sean Combs’s businesses.', 'Ferguson, who has a master’s degree from Harvard Business School but grew up working for his father’s trucking business in the Bronx, testified that he was attracted to Bad Boy Records because it employed people of color and tried to empower young entrepreneurs. “First and foremost, for me coming from the Bronx, I felt like we needed more companies that really would hire people from the communities that I grew up in,” he testified. “What I observed with Bad Boy and Sean Combs was a company that really gave a lot of young executives a lot of opportunities.”', 'Prosecutors are also asking the judge to instruct an organization to remove a social media post that reveals the identity of Mia, the alias for a former Sean Combs assistant who was allowed to testify anonymously against him to protect her privacy. Mia claimed Combs assaulted her repeatedly throughout her employment, including allegedly climbing into her bed and raping her.', 'We’re back from break. The prosecution wants to admit into evidence some communications between Sean Combs and his bodyguard D-Roc, including some that refer to Cassie Ventura.', '“She wants to ice up,” D-Roc told Combs in one message, which prosecutors say relates to Ventura’s injuries. In another, the bodyguard wrote, “She wants to see you but you not f----ing with her.”', 'Ventura has testified that many women in Combs’s circle thought of D-Roc as a friend or ally, but prosecutors allege he was actually funneling information to Combs.', 'When CNN released a video in May 2024 of Sean “Diddy” Combs assaulting his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016 at the InterContinental hotel, it was the first time the public saw evidence of Combs being physically abusive, and it corroborated an allegation Ventura made in her now-settled lawsuit against Combs.', 'After the video went viral, it prompted a now-deleted apology video from Combs, in which he called his behavior “inexcusable.” He’s denied the allegations against him in 70-plus sexual assault lawsuits.', 'The footage then became a key part of the prosecutors’ case against Combs. They alleged in pre-trial court filings that the video helps show Combs’s “persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals.”', 'Combs’s attorneys have criticized the video CNN obtained, alleging that the footage was sped up and edited.

It included Bad Boy Productions, Bad Boy Marketing and Bad Boy Films — all solely owned by Combs. At times, Ferguson was in charge of his personal finances.', 'Combs always drove the creative, marketing and product management of his companies, Ferguson testified, but in time became more of a “chairman” than an active manager. Most of his businesses were profitable, the former CFO said, and Combs drew simultaneous salaries from several of them.', 'The government has called its next witness, Derek Ferguson, who held several executive titles at Sean Combs’s companies, including chief financial officer for Bad Boy Entertainment from 1998 to 2012.', 'Wearing a dark suit and glasses, Ferguson told the jury he is testifying under a subpoena.', 'Eddy Garcia’s number was saved in the phone of Sean Combs’s chief of staff Kristina Khorram, misspelled, as “Eddie my angel.”', 'Garcia, a hotel security worker who says Combs paid him and his colleagues $100,000 for a video of Combs beating Cassie Ventura, testified that the music producer repeatedly called him “his angel” and told him God had put the two of them together.', 'But when Garcia asked Combs for help finding work after he handed over the video, he testified, Combs did not respond to his Instagram message.', 'Court is running a little late after the midmorning recess. Sean Combs sat in the courtroom the entire time. At one point he was the only person at the defense table, where he shuffled through his papers and wrote some notes.', 'Most of the attorneys are back now, milling around.

He’s the attorney we’ve heard from the most this week, even though we’re in the prosecution’s phase of the trial, as Steel delivered a long cross-examination of the pseudonymous witness Mia on Monday.', 'Prosecutors asked Eddy Garcia why he was nervous around Sean Combs while the two men allegedly struck a deal to sell Combs security footage of him beating Cassie Ventura.', 'The hotel guard began to explain his fear of the hip-hop mogul before a sharp objection from defense attorneys halted the line of questioning. Prosecutors are trying to provide the jury with evidence that supports racketeering charges, which involves making threats to extort individuals and companies. The imagery in this testimony is strong: paper bags filled with cash, body guards, money counters, bands of cash and veiled threats.', 'After Eddy Garcia gave Sean Combs a USB drive with the InterContinental security footage and signed two contracts, he testified, Combs stepped out of the room and returned with a money counting machine and a brown paper bag.', 'Garcia said Combs pulled bills out of the bag, ran $100,000 through the counter, and handed it to him, warning him not to make any big purchases.', 'Garcia, a guard at the hotel, testified that he gave $50,000 of the money to his supervisor who approved the deal with Combs, $20,000 to another guard involved in the incident, and kept $30,000 for himself to buy a used vehicle.', 'After Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura told him they wanted the security footage kept quiet, hotel security worker Eddy Garcia testified, he signed nondisclosure agreements averring that the video did not exist on any other servers, and that he would not divulge any details from the deal.', 'Garcia testified that Combs also had him text photos of his driver’s license, as well as IDs for his boss and another security officer who responded to the incident — so that they were “all on the same page.”', 'When Eddy Garcia met with Sean Combs to sell him surveillance footage of Combs beating Cassie Ventura, the security officer testified, he told Combs he worried police would come looking for it if Ventura filed a police report.', 'Combs “said I didn’t have to worry about that,” Garcia told the jury, then put him on the phone with a woman he understood to be Ventura.

(He later testified that Combs paid a total of $100,000.)', '“Eddie my angel, I knew you could help, I knew you could do it,” an excited Combs replied, according to Garcia’s testimony. The next day, he told the jury, Madrano directed him to fudge the time-stamps on his shift logs and go to a high-rise in Los Angeles, where he met with Combs.', '“He was smiling, excited, just looked happy,” said Garcia, who added that his own voice kept cracking with anxiety. He said he personally handed a thumb drive with the video to Combs, and assured him it was the only copy.', 'A hotel security worker testified that Sean Combs’s chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, came to the InterContinental and asked to see surveillance footage on March 5, 2016, shortly after Combs beat Cassie Ventura.', 'The security worker, Eddy Garcia, said Khorram first asked for the video in a phone call and was told she would need a subpoena. When the Combs executive arrived at the hotel lobby, Garcia testified, she inquired again if there was a way she could see it so Combs’s staff could know “what they were dealing with.”', 'Garcia said he apologized to Khorram and insisted again that she needed a subpoena, but gave her a brief description of the footage: “It’s bad.”', 'Between the heckler’s disruption and a lengthy conversation about the Hotel Intercontinental video testimony, we had a bit of a later start than usual.

The CNN footage was a cellphone recording of the hotel’s surveillance footage. The government is expected to call a video expert Tuesday to explain the correct sequence of events, prosecutors say.

She conceded on the stand that she felt ""exhilarated"" afterward.', 'Still, ""I didn\'t think that we would be doing that again,"" she told the jury.

Diddy Pressured ‘Jane’ to Participate in His Fantasies,https://www.vulture.com/article/diddy-trial-jane-day-two-relationship.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'For weekly updates on all the most pivotal and dramatic moments from Diddy’s trial, sign up for our newsletter: Court Appearances: United States v. Diddy, and check out the rest of our trial coverage here.', 'Jane wept as she described how Sean “Diddy” Combs gave her ecstasy so she would stay awake throughout dayslong sexual encounters with male escorts during testimony in his Manhattan federal court sex-trafficking trial on June 6. “He would be like: ‘You’re not getting tired on me, are you? Let’s finish strong, hard. Let’s end on a high note,’” Jane recalled Diddy saying. Her testimony on her second day on the stand provided more details about Diddy’s allegedly coercive sexual demands — which purportedly prioritized his pleasure to the detriment of her welfare. During a Las Vegas encounter in 2023, Jane wanted the escort to wear a condom. Diddy told her “he didn’t want to see a rubber while he was watching.” When Jane brought up condoms, Diddy would “guilt trip” her, she said. As Jane discussed Diddy’s refusal to let her use condoms, she dabbed her eyes with a tissue. Prosecutor Maurene Comey asked her why she didn’t insist on using condoms.“I just didn’t want to disappoint my lover,” Jane said.', 'If Diddy were disappointed, Jane said, “he would just be, just not happy, just not in a good mood or satisfied with me.” Diddy would be “agitated.” Sometimes during these encounters, which they called “hotel nights,” she might have multiple rounds of sex, sometimes with multiple men. Diddy decided when Jane could rest. She recalled taking “a lot” of ecstasy, multiple doses, during hotel nights so she could keep performing. Jane said she wanted the escorts to finish so the marathons could end. “I would try to have sex with them as quickly as I could,” Jane said. “He didn’t like that.”', 'Jane said she needed drugs like ecstasy to get through hotel nights but wanted to try them sober because she was “tired of doing that to my body.” Her attempt failed. “I just remember: I didn’t like it,” she said of being sober during hotel nights. “The fantasy of it all wasn’t there” because it felt “too real.” On another night, when she tried to participate without drugs, Jane said, “I was just disgusted. I was just repulsed.” She said she went to the bathroom and threw up once. Diddy came in and Jane told him she had just vomited. He told her that a third escort was waiting. “Let’s go,” he said. “This guy’s here.”', 'As day two of Jane’s testimony progressed, she described the deep physical and psychological toll of hotel nights. “My shoulders hurt. My back hurt. My lower back hurt,” Jane said of her body afterward. “I’d be at the edge of a seat, or at the edge of a bed, in the position that he liked, doing foreplay on these men.” This would span “many hours,” and she “often got UTIs and yeast infections,” Jane added. Sometimes she experienced vaginal pain but continued performing despite the discomfort. Jane dabbed her eyes with a tissue at a point during this line of questioning. When Jane called out Diddy for spending quality time with another woman after a hotel night, he criticized her. “He would call me ‘crazy’ all the time,” Jane said. Even though Jane knew Diddy was seeing other women, it still hurt that he would take others on outings while she was stuck with his fetish. “Like, I was the woman who had to take this on — take all of this on — and they didn’t,” Jane said. “I [had] just spent my birthday having all these guys having sex with me.”', 'Jane, who is the third woman at Combs’s trial to accuse him of sexual misconduct, started testifying on June 5. Early in Jane’s testimony, she painted a picture of a relationship that soon spiraled into allegedly coerced sexual encounters with male escorts. After wooing Jane with a tropical birthday getaway in early 2021, she and Diddy spent more and more time together, having sex and taking drugs such as ecstasy. “I learned so many things,” she said. “I learned how he liked to have pornography playing. I learned how he preferred me to dress. And I just learned the things that he liked sexually.” This included her appearance, Jane recalled, saying that he wanted her to “dress in provocative lingerie and really high, like stripper, shoes.”', 'After looking at porn sites, she said that Diddy had a pitch: What if they made this fantasy a reality? It was May 2021, and Jane went along with it thinking it was a one-off situation, but the encounter would go on to “completely set the tone” for their relationship going forward. “It was just a door that, like, I was unable to shut for the remainder of the relationship,” she said on her first day of testimony.', 'Jane said she didn’t want to have these encounters. She just wanted an “old-fashioned type relationship” with Diddy. After a few months of routine hotel nights, Jane told Diddy she didn’t want to do them anymore. She said this multiple times throughout their more than three years together. As Jane became financially dependent on Diddy, she had even less power. She recalled Diddy saying things like “‘If you want to break up, that’s fine. Do you need, like, what, three more months in the house? Because I’m not about to be paying for a woman’s rent that I’m not even seeing,’” to keep her under his thumb.', 'Diddy’s financial control over Jane was further detailed in her second day of testimony. Jane started looking for new places to live in spring 2023 and said Diddy proposed an agreement in which he would give her a monthly allowance. She said she asked for $15,000, but they settled upon Diddy’s counteroffer of $10,000. Comey asked Jane, Who’s paying your rent now? “Sean,” Jane replied. Diddy also paid for Jane’s teeth after their trip. “I got new veneers,” Jane explained. “Because he didn’t like my teeth.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXZkR3g2TVRnM1gwNTRUWEEwVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Toward the end of their relationship in 2024, Jane said Combs told her he never knew she didn’t want to partake in “hotel nights” and she believed him at the time but later looked at her text messages with Combs and realized she’d been expressing those feelings since 2021.', 'Remember: Cassie Ventura testified earlier in the trial and also described Combs as “dismissive” when when she expressed wanting to stop engaging in drug-fueled sexual encounters.', 'Text messages: Jane read aloud text messages she sent to Combs in November 2021, in which she described feeling “mistreated” and needing “a breather” and a “break” from Combs.

After the first day on the island alone, Jane recalled that one of the men who would join them for “hotel nights” was suddenly on his way there.

Jane said she fell “head over heels” for Combs in the first few months of their romance, but testified that the relationship hit a turning point in 2021, when it became dominated by drug-fueled sexual encounters she called “hotel nights,” which she said she felt obliged to participate in to appease the music mogul. Despite their breakup and Combs’s arrest last September, he is still paying her rent, she disclosed on Friday.', 'Jane’s lawyer told Judge Arun Subramanian that social media users and news outlets are attempting to reveal Jane’s identity. Her lawyer said these attempts threaten her safety and privacy. The judge told Jane’s attorney to identify who is trying to out her, and added that if someone is found to have violated the rules, he will consider issuing “a gag order to the media.”', 'Federal prosecutors say that for decades, Combs abused, threatened and coerced women to participate in marathon sexual encounters called “freak offs” and used his business empire, along with guns, kidnapping and arson, to conceal his crimes.', 'The 55-year-old hip-hop mogul is facing five criminal counts: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.', 'Combs has pleaded not guilty.

She confirmed during Friday’s testimony that Combs is still paying her rent.', '“Who’s paying your rent now?” prosecutor Maurene Comey asked. “Sean,” Jane replied.', 'Jane testified that she repeatedly told Combs that she didn’t want to have sex with other men, either in person or through text messages. She said since Combs had financial control over her life, she felt “obligated” to participate and wanted to make him happy.', 'In order to get through the “hotel nights,” Jane said she “had to” take drugs because “it would just make things easier,” she said, breaking down in tears. “When I wouldn’t, it would just feel too real.”', 'In 2023, Jane said she told Combs she wanted to stop having “hotel nights.” She told Combs in a text message that she wished they could go back to their early dating days, and said she didn’t “want to feel obligated to perform these nights for you.”', 'In 2023, Jane said she flew to Miami to celebrate her birthday with Combs.

She said she was used to it and was always high on drugs when he recorded. “It was just a part of what was happening,” Jane said.', 'The jury listened to audio from a video recording of one of the “hotel nights.” In the clip, Jane asked one of the male entertainers to wear a condom, but Combs expressed his disapproval and intervened.', 'Between May 2021 and October 2023, Jane testified that Combs typically kept cash in hotel bedroom nightstands in order to pay the male entertainers that would participate in the “hotel nights,” which she said took place in multiple states: California, New York and Florida.', 'Combs ran out of cash “every so often” and he would call members of his staff to bring him cash.', 'On two occasions, Combs asked Jane to bring a package of drugs from California to Miami in her checked luggage, she testified, describing how nervous she was smuggling pills on commercial flights. Jane said she was uncomfortable with the idea, but that Combs’s chief of staff Kristina Khorram told her, “It’s fine, I do it all the time.”', 'Jane testified that she delivered the drugs to Combs and ended up using some of them with him.', 'Big picture: Prosecutors are trying to show with Jane’s testimony that what began as a romantic relationship with Combs turned into coerced sex acts and transportation of drugs across state lines.

The government needs to prove that the alleged victims were forced into acts they normally wouldn’t be comfortable participating in.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXZkR3g2TVRnM1gwNTRUWEEwVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Ex-Girlfriend and Alleged “Diddy” Victim Testifies How 90 Percent of Their Sex Involved Other Men,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/diddy-trial-jane-doe-sex-90-percent-with-other-men-1236257282/,"['', '', ""The woman going by Jane Doe from the witness stand at the rap mogul's trial detailed a romantic courtship that devolved quickly into drug-fueled sex marathons with other men."", 'BY KEVIN DOLAK', 'A woman federal prosecutors are calling a victim of Sean “Diddy” Combs took the stand at his federal trial in lower Manhattan on Thursday, telling the court that during their three year relationship, which lasted up until his September arrest, 90 percent of their time together was during drug-fueled, days-long “freak-offs” where she was coerced into performing sex acts with male sex workers.', 'The woman, who is being referred to as Jane Doe during the trial to protect her identity, is the latest woman brought forth by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to explain how the feds say the once powerful rap and fashion mogul used his companies and loyal staff as a criminal enterprise to coerce and control women, whom he would blackmail and manipulate into performing in “freak-off” sex marathons, which the near-billionaire would often film while masturbating. Combs has pled not guilty to all charges in the feds’ five-count indictment, which includes sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. ', '', 'Taking the stand after court had returned from the day’s lunch break, Jane Doe revealed early in her testimony that prior to connecting romantically with Combs in 2021, she was involved with a man with whom Combs has history and a tense relationship. She said she met the rap world icon in Miami at a party she attended with a group of girlfriends, one of whom was casually dating Combs at the time, since his 2018 split with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, the federal prosecutors’ star witness. Combs has been involved with several women at once, a fact that Doe told the jury was known to her as the relationship’s inception. ', 'Over her first few hours of testimony Thursday afternoon, Doe painted a picture of the couple’s meet-cute and easy segue into a more serious relationship, which grew over phone calls, texts and FaceTime video calls. In fact, their relationship saw a boom when Doe’s friend, who was dating Combs, got engaged and moved to Europe. Soon, she told the court, Combs swept her off her feet with a trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas over 15 days. The two enjoyed the relaxing island and dinner on their hotel suite’s balcony, where they enjoyed viewing sunsets together. She recalled how he even bought her a bracelet that spells out L-O-V-E. Their sex life was the two of them; she was smitten. ', '', '“I really fell head over heels for Sean,” she said, adding that it was OK for her that he was also seeing other people because she really liked him. “I understood that on his end, it was never a monogamous relationship. ', 'One small hiccup on the trip, she recalled, came when Doe was handed an ecstasy pill by Combs and ended up so gobsmacked by the mind-bending drug that she doubled over in the sand and had to be taken into a tepid shower; over the remainder of the 15-day trip, Doe said she took Ecstacy 10 more times in smaller increments that were pieced out by Combs. ', 'The questioning prosecuting attorney on Thursday quickly moved on to the moment that the relationship soured for Doe, when she asked her to recall for the court the night of March 21, 2021, when she was asked to participate in her first “freak-off” with Combs, which were also referred to as “hotel nights” at times. After Combs’ assistants had set up the hotel suite, Doe said, she would dress in racy lingerie and high-heeled shoes. That was when Combs told her someone was coming: a male escort named Don, whom Combs said he knew. The encounter as described by Doe followed a familiar trajectory, one described by Ventura a few weeks ago when she testified about her “freak-off” experiences: the woman and escort would pour baby oil onto each other’s bodies (12 bottles one time, she said); the two begin touching; Doe begins to perform oral sex on Don as Combs watches, masturbating. From the witness stand, Doe said that it was she who “tried to move things along” into the suite’s bedroom. Combs protested when Doe asked to use a condom, she explained to the court, but he soon provided one and Don and Doe began to have sex.

It just completely set the tone for our relationship moving forward.”', 'When asked to give a percentage figure by federal prosecutors, Doe told the court that after May 2021, 90 percent of the sexual experiences she had with Combs involved other men. The rapper, Doe told the court, suggested they have a hotel night the very next time the two saw each other. ', '“I just wanted to satisfy my partner,” she said of participating in the freak-offs. ', 'As their relationship stretched into months, Combs began to give large sums of money to Doe, whose work marketing brands on her social media accounts was dwindling. He handed her $10,000 after their initial trip to Turks and Caicos as she’d missed out on some work while on the trip with him; later, he’d typically give her $5,000 or $6,000 incrementally. As was the case with Ventura, he began to pay for her apartment; Doe said this was a reason she felt compelled to participate in “freak-offs” even when she started to not enjoy them.', '“I felt obligated to perform because my partner was paying my rent,” she explained. ', '', 'An attempt she had planned to earn her own money by launching an Only Fans account, where she would appear in lingerie and bikinis, could have helped out with a sense of independence — as she told Combs, a friend had claimed she’d brought in $4 million in a year doing a Just Fans page. But Combs, she testified, was having none of that, telling her, “Let’s just give it time.” Prosecutors believe this constitutes coercion to keep Doe financially dependent on him so he could control her and force her into his sexual fantasies. ', 'At a point, Doe says, she asked Combs if they could stop doing “freak-offs” altogether. His response, she told the court, was to threaten her livelihood and home. ', ""“He would just say things like, ‘If you want to break up, that’s fine. You have three months left on the house because I’m not about to be paying rent,'” Jane recalled Combs saying."", 'Doe’s testimony will continue Friday as the prosecution begins to eye the resting of its case.

Diddy’s Ex ‘Jane’ Describes Hellish ‘Hotel Nights’,https://www.thecut.com/article/jane-testimony-diddy-trial-bryana-bongolan-week-5.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'The fifth week of the sex-trafficking case against Sean “Diddy” Combs introduced testimony from a third anonymous victim: “Jane,” a single mother who dated Combs between 2020 and 2024. Jane alleged that Combs used financial control over her life to secure her continued participation in the Freak Offs at the center of the trial.', 'Prosecutors allege that Combs coerced women — including his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura — into prolonged sexual encounters with male escorts, which often lasted for days thanks to the drugs he allegedly used to keep participants compliant and awake. The government claims that Combs engaged in physical, financial, and psychological abuse to make sure the women obeyed, and that he would film Freak Offs to blackmail them into silence. (Combs denies these allegations and has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking and racketeering charges against him.) So far, Jane’s testimony appears to support their argument. Jane told the court that, after she agreed to one third-party sexual scenario with Combs, she felt she had opened “a Pandora’s box” that she was “unable to shut for the remainder of [the] relationship.”', 'Additionally, jurors heard from several other witnesses for the prosecution whose testimony is intended to show that Combs’s alleged transgressions stretched beyond his sexual partners. A Beverly Hills Hotel employee recalled Combs booking rooms under the name of an assistant, Phillip Pines, and accruing hefty cleaning fees for “oil damage” and drapes that were “soiled beyond what is normal.” A forensic video investigator testified that security footage from the InterContinental Century City Hotel in Los Angeles — which shows Combs beating Ventura in 2016 — had not been tampered with or edited, as the defense has repeatedly claimed. Bad Boy’s former CFO went over financial records confirming a $20,000 transfer from Ventura’s parents to Combs, which previous witnesses said was made to keep the rapper from releasing sex tapes of their daughter. And at one point, presiding judge Arun Subramanian threatened to eject Combs from the courtroom after catching him repeatedly making faces at jurors in an apparent bid for interaction.', 'Here are the key takeaways from this week’s testimony.', 'On Monday, “Mia,” a pseudonymous former personal assistant to Combs who accused the mogul of raping and sexually assaulting her multiple times over the course of her employment, got back on the stand to resume cross-examination. Last week, Combs’s lawyers zoomed in on Mia’s digital footprint, drilling her about social-media posts that showed her boss in a positive light and affectionate text messages she sent after the death of his longtime girlfriend, Kim Porter. The defense seemed to suggest that being effusive on Instagram meant she couldn’t have been abused in real life. But glowing posts — particularly for Combs’s birthday — were a job requirement, Mia told the court. If she didn’t share them, “I would be screamed at, humiliated, made fun of, and my job would be threatened,” she said, per CNN.', 'Defense attorney Brian Steel also asked Mia if she ever filmed Combs in a “moment of rage,” as taking BTS footage was one of her jobs. She replied: “No, I would not have been allowed to film that.” Noting that Mia never told friends or family what was going on, Steel went so far as to ask Mia if she actually had been sexually assaulted by Combs. According to NBC, she replied, “I would not lie in this courtroom. I never lied in this courtroom; everything I have said is true.” She also added that she was “terrified and brainwashed” during her time working for Combs.', '“Nobody acted like what was happening to me was wrong,” she said, according to CNN. “He threatened to tell Cassie quote, unquote ‘everything,’ which made me feel like I had done something wrong. I don’t know how to explain what that does to a person.”', 'Part of Steel’s questioning seemed designed to suggest a “Me Too money grab”: Mia did not initially tell prosecutors that Combs had assaulted her. It took her months to come forward with those claims, and on the stand, she explained that she did not want to raise them until she had retained counsel. (Per the Washington Post, Mia hired the attorney who successfully represented writer E. Jean Carroll in her sexual assault and defamation suit against Donald Trump.) Mia insisted she had no intention of suing Combs, and she held her ground despite the weight of Steel’s skepticism. Affirming each of the allegations of abuse she’d made, she reminded the jury why victims sometimes speak positively about the people who’ve harmed them: “It’s called psychological abuse.”', 'According to CNN, security guard Eddy Garcia was on duty on March 5 when the InterContinental’s security desk received a call from Kristina Khorram, Combs’s chief of staff, asking “if there was any possible way to get a copy of the video or see the video” of an incident involving her boss earlier that day. “I told her that she would have to reach out to hotel management or get a subpoena,” Garcia testified. Khorram then showed up in person, and Garcia warned her that, while he wasn’t authorized to show her the tape, “off the record, it’s bad.” Combs’s side continued to push, and Garcia said Khorram and the mogul ultimately called him on his personal cell — a number he hadn’t given to either of them — to make their case. Combs, Garcia testified, said “that something like this could ruin him,” according to CNN. Combs also told Garcia that “he would take care of me,” Garcia alleged. Garcia then called his boss, who agreed to sell the tape for $50,000.', 'A few days later, Garcia delivered the footage to Combs on a USB drive. While Garcia assured the mogul that the original had been erased from the hotel’s servers, Garcia also expressed concern about what might happen to him if Ventura changed her mind about reporting the assault. Garcia testified that Combs then got Ventura on FaceTime and instructed her to “let him know that you want this to go away, too,” which she did. Garcia signed an NDA with a $1 million break clause and texted Combs photos of his ID, his manager’s, and another on-duty security guard’s — to ensure they were “all on the same page,” Combs told Garcia, according to the Washington Post. Garcia said Combs produced stacks of cash from a paper bag and fed them through a counter until he reached $100,000. Garcia’s cut came to $30,000. A few weeks later, Combs texted him, writing “Happy Easter my angel, God is good,” and then proceeded to ask if anyone had asked about the incident or the video, Garcia testified.', 'On Wednesday, fashion designer Bryana “Bana” Bongolan took the stand and recounted complaints she’d lodged in a December 2024 lawsuit against Combs — namely that, in 2016, he barged into Ventura’s apartment, grabbed Bongolan, and held her over a balcony.', 'Bongolan testified that she became friends with Ventura at some point in 2014 or 2015, but held off on meeting Combs for about a year. “I wasn’t really fond of what I was seeing,” she said, per CNN, citing a black eye Combs had given Ventura. Bongolan said she witnessed Combs’s controlling behavior firsthand: The mogul would often show up at Ventura’s door late at night and start banging on the door, Bongolan said, and once, he threw a knife at Ventura when she answered. On another occasion, Bongolan said she and Ventura were on a photo shoot when Combs allegedly “came up really close to my face and said something around the lines of, ‘I’m the devil and I could kill you.’” She testified that she had no idea what made him say that.', 'She also claimed to have no idea what prompted him to hold her over a balcony in September 2016. Bongolan testified that she and her ex-girlfriend had been asleep on Ventura’s couch that night when Combs showed up. Telling her partner to hide in the bathroom, Bongolan said she went out to the balcony and tried to act casual. She was about to start smoking a blunt when Combs came up behind her: Grabbing her under the armpits, “he lifted me up and then had me on top of the rail,” she recalled. Bongolan is under five feet tall and weighed about 100 pounds at the time, according to her lawsuit. She testified that, as he dangled her midair, Combs was yelling at her, “Do you know what the fuck you did?” After about 15 seconds, he hauled her back over the railing and tossed her onto the patio furniture. From that collision, Bongolan sustained a large bruise on her leg and also hurt her neck and back badly enough that she needed a neck brace, per the Washington Post. She said she was too scared to involve the police, and that when she spoke to Combs on the phone a few days later, she told him repeatedly, “‘I don’t want any problems with you.’”', 'In cross-examination, the defense focused on Bongolan and Ventura’s drug habit, which Bongolan agreed was “serious.” Combs’s attorneys leveraged her party history to suggest she may not have correctly remembered the situations she described, according to NBC. The knife incident, for example: Bongolan couldn’t explain why Combs had a knife or where it came from. “I don’t know how it happened. I just saw what I saw,” she told the defense, per the Post. The defense also pressed her on a detail that appeared in her lawsuit, but which she didn’t mention on the witness stand: That in the process of lifting her over the balcony, Combs had groped her breast hard enough to leave a bruise. Bongolan admitted that an attorney she’d hired included the claim in a demand letter to Combs, but clarified that she had fired him because the information was incorrect. But the defense kept pushing, bringing out hotel receipts that seemed to suggest Combs was in New York City during the time frame the assault allegedly occurred. “You came in here and lied to the jury, isn’t that true?” defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland challenged Bongolan, according to NBC. “I can’t agree with you,” the witness replied. “I will never forget him holding me on that balcony.”', 'Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” another of Combs’s former girlfriends took the stand on Thursday, kicking off what is expected to be days of questioning. Jane said she met Combs at a Miami yacht party in 2020 and continued dating him right up until his arrest in September 2024. Like Ventura, Jane — an influencer and a single mother — described the mogul as “larger than life” and said she fell “head over heels” for him quickly. Their first date, according to CNN, lasted five days. Shortly thereafter, Combs took her to Turks and Caicos, followed by the Bahamas, for her birthday. Whereas Jane had only taken drugs on two other occasions, she said she took ecstasy nine times during the Turks and Caicos leg of their trip alone. And at the end of their vacation, Combs offered to pay her $10,000 to make up for lost income. Although Combs told Jane he was seeing other people, “In my heart, I just wanted to see Sean, so I was monogamous,” she testified.', 'The pair kept their relationship private, but between February and May 2021, Jane said Combs paid to fly her to Miami on a biweekly basis. The couple did a lot of drugs — ketamine, cocaine, molly, and ecstasy — and Jane testified they would have sex for 12 to 24 hours at a time. In May, Combs asked her how she might feel about bringing another man into the equation. Thinking she was “playing into the fantasy,” she said, “okay.” A few hours later, Jane said she found herself in a hotel room where Combs informed her that “Don,” a man from an escort service, was coming up to meet them. Still high and “super-nervous,” Jane said she’d gone along with the situation so far “because my partner was excited and it was already happening.” Vulture reports that, when Jane asked that Don wear a condom, Combs said he didn’t want that. This refusal turned out to be a recurring theme: On several future occasions when Jane asked for a condom, she said that Combs became “almost incensed,” according to NBC: “He said he didn’t want to see a rubber while he was watching.”', 'Still, that first night, Jane testified, “it was taboo, it was fun, I had a good time with my partner.” She also assumed it would be a one-time thing. Instead, she said, it “opened like a Pandora’s box.” Combs’s interests increasingly shifted to these third-party scenarios, Jane said, until about 90 percent of their sex life involved male escorts. According to CNN, Jane testified that she only agreed because she “feared losing him.” But as time went on and she voiced her discomfort with his demands, Combs was “dismissive,” insinuating that he would break up with her and stop paying her rent if she declined. Between May 2021 and October 2023, Jane said she and Combs had “hotel nights” every time they saw each other.', 'Like Cassie, Jane said she had to keep herself groomed in a specific way in anticipation of these encounters: Straight hair, light nail polish, tanned skin. The hotel nights themselves also followed a similar pattern: The room would be set up with red lights and sheets draped over everything, Jane said, to help guard against damage from the more than two-dozen bottles of baby oil they typically used during the encounter. Combs would direct Jane and her partner through a period of “prolonged foreplay,” per CNN, which progressed to oral sex and, eventually, intercourse. Hotel nights could stretch between 24 and 30 hours, according to NBC, during which Jane didn’t get to sleep and often had sex with more than one man. Crying on the stand, she recalled Combs feeding her “multiple doses” of ecstasy in a single night to make sure she stayed awake, and refusing her requests for a break. Jane told the court that, when the drugs ran out, Combs would send his employees to buy more. On two occasions, he instructed Jane to fly with drugs, according to CNN. When Jane asked Khorram, the chief of staff, about the risks, she said Khorram assured Jane she “did it all the time” and it wasn’t a big deal.', 'Jane said that, on a few occasions, she tried to get through hotel nights without any substances, but found that “it was too real.” On one occasion when she forwent drugs, she went to the bathroom and threw up after having sex with two different escorts, NBC reports. “Sean came in and he was like, ‘That’s good, you’ll feel better. Let’s go, the third guy is here,’” Jane testified. Without the drugs, she said, she felt “repulsed” by herself.', 'As she continued seeing Combs, Jane said she devoted less and less time to her career. She felt she needed to be ready if Combs decided he wanted to see her. Combs would give her money, lump sums ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 at a time, to cover her bills, her housing, and her expenses, according to the Post. At some point, Combs proposed a contract: He would cover her monthly rent — the equivalent of about $10,000 per month, according to CNN. Although she felt like she had no choice but to go along with his demands, Jane told Combs she didn’t enjoy his hotel nights.', '“I wish we could take this back to when we first started dating,” she texted him, according to NBC. “Ever since I opened Pandora’s box, I haven’t been able to close it.” Participating in the marathon sex sessions was “dark, sleazy,and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” she continued. “It’s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for my house. I don’t want to feel obligated to perform and fear losing you. I don’t want to feel like that anymore,. I just want to talk like adults and figure where we go from here.” He reportedly responded: “Girl stop.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXZkR3g2TVRnM1gwNTRUWEEwVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

She eventually told Combs she wouldn’t attend due to her period.', '“Don’t stress me about money ever again,” Combs wrote in a string of crude text messages.', 'Jane, an ex-girlfriend of Sean Combs’s who is alleging that he sex-trafficked her, has spent a lot of Friday reading aloud long chains of text messages between her and Combs, explaining in fine detail the sex acts that she said she felt “obligated” to participate in as Combs flexed more psychological and financial control over her. Jane is a pseudonym.', 'She was in the middle of reading another long text chain when someone in the courtroom sneezed.

But shortly after arriving, Combs seemed bored and invited a male escort and personal trainer to join them.', '“We had another one of these long nights,” Jane told the jury. who did not know an escort would be joining them. At one point, she said, she had sex for more than 24 hours. “It was just really painful,” said Jane. “I was extremely sore at this point.”', 'Jane said she tried to distance herself from Sean Combs for a period in early 2023.

Combs would typically pay escorts, and if the events ran long, Jane said, he would have one of his employees bring more cash to the room, much like staff routinely supplied pill bottles full of illegal drugs.', 'Prosecutors are hoping to underscore the amount of cash and illegal activity that flowed through a single night in one of Combs’ freak-offs.

She recalled paying at least two men with cash from what she referred to as Combs’s “cash drawer” in the hotel rooms they used for freak-offs.', 'One of the lower-level charges against Combs involves transporting men or women across state lines “with intent that such individual engage in prostitution,” language stemming from 1910 legislation known as the Mann Act. Prosecutors have presented compelling evidence to meet the legal criteria for that charge.', 'Combs’s legal team has attacked this strategy as racially motivated, noting that the Mann Act was used to convict Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, for fraternizing with White women. President Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Johnson in 2018.', 'A network of prostitutes was available for freak-offs, Jane testified, but she and Sean Combs eventually started recruiting porn stars to join the sessions. Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym, said she reached out to at least two adult film stars, including one named “Chef” because he worked as a private cook on the side. She said she began suggesting Combs hire porn stars rather than prostitutes, so she could have sex with men she was familiar with rather than strangers.', 'When assistant U.S. attorney Maurene Comey asked Jane why she acted “cute and bubbly” with a particular porn star, the witness replied: “Because he was familiar with me.

Jane said she was uncomfortable with the idea, but a member of Combs’s staff told her she often carried his drugs.', 'The breadth of this testimony is growing, and prosecutors are guiding it to show that, for Jane, what began as an idealistic relationship with Combs devolved into forced sex acts and transporting controlled substances across state lines. The government’s racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges revolve around victims being forced into actions they otherwise would not have been comfortable doing.', 'Sean Combs would regularly run out of drugs during freak-offs and have his security guards or assistants fetch more, his former girlfriend testified under her alias, Jane. She said staff would show up at the hotel rooms with pill bottles full of ecstasy, cocaine and a mixture of cannabis and tobacco.', 'Jane said she and Combs usually took stimulants, but a dealer named Guido would sometimes bring Xanax. “You need something really heavy to knock you out,” Jane said. “I would take it after I put Sean to sleep.”', 'Sean Combs’s lawyers are crowding around him at the defense table while the court is on a short break.

She said she eventually asked Combs for ecstasy.', 'By 2023, Jane testified, she was concerned for Sean Combs’s health and got him to promise to take a month off from drugs. He agreed, if they could have one last “sobriety party,” she said.', 'The couple booked a hotel room at the L’Ermitage in Beverly Hills, where Jane struggled without drugs to perform sex acts for 12 to 18 hours. After sex with two male escorts she began throwing up, she said. “Sean came in and I told him I had just thrown up and he was like, ‘that’s good then you’ll feel better. … Let’s go because the guy is here, the third guy.’”', 'Jane, a former girlfriend of Sean Combs, is reading a text message from 2023 in which she pleaded with him to stop having freak-offs. By that point he was paying for her rent and living expenses. “Ever since I opened Pandora’s box I’ve never been able to close it,” read the text. “I’m so much more than being loved in the dark in hotel rooms doing things that make me feel disgusted.”', '“I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore. It’s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” she continued. “I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.”', '“Girl stop,” Combs replied.', 'Eventually, Sean Combs only wanted to have sex with Jane after she had spent hours with a male prostitute, his former girlfriend testified under her court-approved pseudonym. Jane explained that due to her love for and infatuation with Combs, she longed for one-on-one time with him, which she only got after having sex with other men while he watched. “I started to feel obligated, that I had to perform,” Jane said.', 'Her testimony is strikingly similar to that of Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs years before Jane. In the trial’s first week, Ventura also broke down on the stand as she said freak-offs were the “only time I could get” with Combs.', 'Sean Combs’s mother, Janice Combs, was seen entering the courthouse Friday in a floral outfit.', 'Jane recalled crying at least twice during freak-offs with Sean Combs and male escorts, once during a group sex session at the Waldorf in Beverly Hills when Combs seemed offended. “He said, ‘Are you crying?’ and just looked, like, disgusted with my face,” Jane testified.', ""The second time was in Miami, when Jane said she was so high she was intermittently blacking out. Jane clung to Combs’s butler in desperation before Combs made her have sex with an escort, she testified. Later, she said, she broke down in tears in the shower with Combs. “He just said, ‘don’t f---ing do this right now. I’m high and I can’t f---ing see that. I’m too high,'' Jane told the jury."", 'Jane shuddered, averted her eyes and broke down in tears as video of her performing sex acts in a freak-off played in the courtroom. She paused her testimony, took a breath and collected herself, as she has done three times in the past 10 minutes as the footage plays.', 'Combs leaned in alongside his attorneys to watch the video, which he recorded. Due to concerns around anonymity, videos of Jane in freak-offs are being shown to jurors and lawyers, but only the audio is made available for the rest of the court and journalists.', 'A video recording from a freak-off or “hotel night” is playing, in which Jane asked a male escort to use a condom. (We in the press room can only hear the audio, to protect the privacy of the witness, who is testifying under a pseudonym.) The escort agrees, before Combs can be heard walking into the room. Jane’s voice cracks, saying “you promised.” Then Combs apparently refuses the request, telling her: “You are just taking that. …”', 'The prosecution is trying to demonstrate that the freak-offs were not always, or not totally, consensual for partners of Combs such as Jane, who is testifying under a pseudonym. “I just understood that my request was going to be denied,” she told the jury.', '“He wanted me to be wild and sexual,” Jane testified, describing Sean Combs’s instructions to her during their freak-offs, or “hotel nights” with male prostitutes.', 'The prosecution witness testifying under a pseudonym said she asked the male prostitutes to use condoms on multiple occasions, but she said she eventually stopped trying because Combs preferred her to have unprotected sex..""He did not want to see a rubber while watching,” she testified.', 'On Thursday, Jane told jurors that freak-offs would typically last 24 to 30 hours, during which Combs would watch her and the escorts perform sex acts while he masturbated.', 'Jane is back on the stand. Testifying under a pseudonym, she spoke yesterday of how her passionate and exciting, sometimes “taboo ” relationship with Sean Combs devolved into forced sex acts under financial duress.', 'She is wearing a maroon suit, and like yesterday, seems shaky but resolved. As she took a seat on the witness stand, she looked down at her hands, taking a deep breath before giving a terse, slight smile to the courtroom.', 'The parties are discussing how much evidence can be allowed as part of Jane’s testimony, including six years of text messages between two of Sean Combs’s personal assistants that the government hopes to admit. Prosecutors have culled some of the messages at the request of the defense, but Combs’s team is arguing there are still too many.', 'The judge will allow the texts, insofar as they are relevant. The glimpse we saw included communications about cleaning hotel rooms.', 'Sean Combs entered the courtroom wearing a dark sweater over a white collared shirt. Like most days, he spoke with his lawyers, hugging some of them, looked into the gallery and maintained a relaxed and collegial demeanor. He has visibly taken an active role in his defense, conferring with his attorneys and passing notes during witness testimony. Testimony from those who worked with or under Combs describe him as an involved chief executive. It seems he takes the same posture with his defense attorneys.', 'As with every day of this trial, there is a line to enter the courtroom. Spectators and live-streamers show up remarkably early to put their names on a list that will guarantee them access to the main courtroom, where Sean Combs sits. On Friday, one spectator said he had to leave the trial by lunch, as he hoped to catch the verdict in disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s trial two buildings over, where the jury is in deliberations.

"What happened in Sean 'Diddy' Combs's trial: $100K payment, freak-offs and more this week",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/happened-sean-diddy-combss-trial-212159829.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Drug-fueled freak-offs described in graphic detail, testimony of a $100,000 bribe and the judge’s threat to kick Sean “Diddy” Combs out of the proceedings are among the most prominent moments captured in the sex-trafficking trial of the hip-hop impresario this week.', 'Since May 12, prosecutors have been building their case that Combs allegedly wielded his enormous power in the entertainment industry to coerce women into sex trafficking and used manipulation and bribery to coax his employees and other witnesses into helping him get away with crimes including physical assault and prostitution.', 'In previous weeks, witnesses have included singer Cassie Ventura, rapper Kid Cudi and former Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard.', 'In a case this sprawling and this high profile, it can be tough to keep up — or weed out misinformation. Here’s what you need to know.', 'The most serious — and sprawling — charge Combs is facing is racketeering conspiracy. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for this charge alone, and possibly more if he’s found to have committed other offenses, such as kidnapping and sex trafficking.', 'Combs is also facing two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion. These counts revolve around two women, Ventura and “Jane,” an ex-girlfriend of Combs’s who is testifying under a pseudonym. Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life in prison.', 'Related to the sex trafficking counts, Combs additionally faces two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Also known as the Mann Act, these charges are particularly controversial, with critics pointing to the racialized way the government has historically wielded this law. Before trial, Combs tried unsuccessfully to get these counts dropped.', 'Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges, arguing that Ventura and Jane were consensual participants in unorthodox sex acts. The defense has also cast doubt on the alleged crimes associated with the racketeering conspiracy charge.', 'If convicted on all counts, Combs faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.', 'Judge Arun Subramanian’s stated goal is to wrap the trial up by the July Fourth holiday. The government is now more than halfway done presenting its case against Combs.', 'So far, the government has called 28 witnesses to support its case. These include Ventura and Jane, two former girlfriends who have accused the producer of sex trafficking.', 'They’ve also called two men who say they received money after having sex with Ventura in front of Combs and eight former Combs employees, including a former financial executive, several personal assistants, a makeup artist, a stylist and a singer signed to his Bad Boy record label.', 'A number of these witnesses have corroborated key elements of Ventura’s testimony, including nine who personally witnessed Combs assault Ventura and two who said the music mogul attempted to pay them off in exchange for their cooperation covering up the abuse.', 'The defense team finished its cross-examination of a former Combs assistant, who testified under the pseudonym “Mia,” on Monday.', 'Mia previously testified that she had a complicated relationship with Combs, describing a boss who would routinely build up her confidence, then “humiliate” her and break her down. She described physical assaults for minor infractions and several sexual assaults, including an alleged rape. This alleged sexual abuse was “sporadic” throughout her time working for Combs. Still, Mia also testified that she saw Combs as an authority figure and “protector.”', 'Defense attorney Brian Steel picked apart Mia’s account of her time working for Combs, asking her to explain how a tormented victim could also be affectionate in a number of positive social media posts and text exchanges. He also accused Mia of lying twice, at one point asking if she was part of the “MeToo money grab.” Mia responded that she would never lie in court.', 'Eddy Garcia, a security guard contracted with the InterContinental Hotel in 2016, said Combs and his chief of staff personally reached out to him to secure hotel footage showing Combs brutally attacking Ventura.', 'Garcia said Combs repeatedly referred to him as “Eddy my angel,” and coaxed the security worker into handing over the surveillance video because “he knew I was a good guy” and that Combs would “take care of” him.', 'With the blessing of his manager, Garcia personally gave Combs a USB drive with the footage from the hotel camera in exchange for $100,000 cash, which was split between Garcia, his manager and another employee.', 'Garcia also signed two contracts that were shown in court, including a nondisclosure agreement.', 'Combs’s defense did not dispute the payment, instead focusing on a section of the contract that said that Garcia could still cooperate with law enforcement. (The significance: To prove bribery under California state law, where the payoff occurred, prosecutors must show that the payment was to avoid legal repercussions. Combs’s defense argued that the payoff was to protect his and Ventura’s reputations.)', 'Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura’s, took the stand to recount a 2016 incident in which Combs allegedly dangled her over a high-rise balcony railing and then threw her into patio furniture, leaving her with cuts and bruises.', 'Bongolan detailed many of the same allegations in a civil lawsuit she filed against Combs in November 2024, in which she’s seeking $10 million in damages.', 'Bongolan testified that she was using drugs heavily at the time and couldn’t remember some key details, including the exact day of the alleged assault. But she said she had “no doubt” that Combs assaulted her on that balcony.', 'The defense tried to paint Bongolan as a drug-abusing liar on cross-examination — then showed proof that Combs wasn’t in Los Angeles on Sept. 26, 2016 — the date Bongolan said the incident happened in her lawsuit.', 'A woman using the pseudonym Jane took the stand as she described in excruciating detail the “hotel nights” or freak-offs that she would have with Combs after the couple started seeing each other in 2020. What started as an open relationship quickly devolved into forced sex acts and transporting controlled substances across state lines, she testified.', 'Jane’s identity is being kept secret because she’s an alleged victim of a sex crime.', 'On Friday, the single mother broke down in tears as video of her performing sex acts in a freak-off played in the courtroom. (Spectators and press could only hear the audio to protect the privacy of the witness.)', 'Her testimony is strikingly similar to that of Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs years before Jane.', 'The pair regularly took drugs during freak-offs, Jane testified, including ecstasy, cocaine and other illicit substances. She said she was twice asked to bring a package of drugs from California to Miami in her checked luggage.', 'A network of prostitutes was available for these encounters, Jane said in court, but she and Combs eventually started recruiting adult-film stars to join the sessions.', 'Jane testified that she had asked on multiple occasions if they could stop having hotel nights, but continued doing so because she felt trapped by his control over her finances.', '“I don’t want to play this role in your life anymore. It’s dark, sleazy, and makes me feel disgusted with myself,” read a text message from 2023. “I don’t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.”', 'By that point he was paying for her living expenses as part of a verbal “love contract,” she testified, noting that he continues to pay her rent.', 'The defense has said in opening statements that Jane, like Ventura, was a willing participant in everything she and Combs did together. Combs’s lawyer Teny Geragos told the jury described Jane’s first freak-off as a “consensual threesome.”', 'A small but very vocal contingent of Sean “Diddy” Combs supporters have been showing up at the trial since it started, at times creating a watch-party-like atmosphere in the overflow rooms.', 'That’s technically not supposed to happen. Members of the public — including media — in the overflow rooms are expected to conduct themselves as if they were in the actual courtroom: quietly and without disruption.', 'On Thursday morning, Judge Subramanian addressed the overflow room before the day’s proceedings, reminding them of these rules.', 'Combs was seen nodding his head vigorously at jurors at least twice on Thursday morning, in response to cross-examination that appeared to be going favorably for him.', 'Subramanian has been explicit throughout the trial that jurors and the parties — Combs, as well as government and defense attorneys — are not to interact with the jury in any way, to help avoid any appearance of impropriety.', 'Transcripts show that the judge warned defense lawyers about the interactions during a sidebar discussion. Then, Combs did it again.', 'It was the sternest Subramanian has been during the trial. “Is it going to happen again, Mr. Agnifilo?” the judge asked during his rebuke. “It’s not going to happen again, Judge,” Agnifilo replied.', 'Moments before being asked that question, former Combs employee Derek Ferguson had praised Combs’s business acumen and said that he had never witnessed any criminal activity. So defense counsel Agnifilo may have thought he would score an easy win with it.', 'Instead, there was a long pause as Ferguson grappled with the question.', 'Many of the former employees who took the stand over the last four weeks have expressed feeling both love and fear, reverence and horror, toward their former boss.', 'Jane will continue her testimony, which is expected to be accompanied by troves of evidence, in part because of how recent the events are.', 'She is expected to detail one particularly disturbing alleged incident that took place in June 2024 — just a year ago — during which Combs brutally assaulted her and then forced her to have sex with an escort. Combs was already being investigated by the federal government for sex trafficking at the time.', 'Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey has called it “one of the clearest cut incidents of sex trafficking” in the trial.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXZkR3g2TVRnM1gwNTRUWEEwVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Cassie has testified Combs assaulted her numerous times and made her endure “hundreds” of encounters with male sex workers called “ freak-offs ” that he allegedly watched and filmed.', 'Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges of running his business empire as a racketeering enterprise that enabled and concealed the abuse of women over two decades. He faces 15 years to life if convicted.', 'Jane testified she told Combs repeatedly, in person and in writing, that she did not want to keep having those freak-offs with other men. But Combs kept pushing her into them and she felt “obligated” to go along with it, she said. He also had control over her life in other ways, she said, including by paying the rent on her home.', 'Jane spoke barely above a whisper to an attentive jury throughout her afternoon testimony. Jurors leaned forward as she testified, and several jurors sometimes looked toward Combs as she spoke. Combs mostly looked straight at Jane, however it did not seem that she ever reciprocated.', 'A single mother, Jane said she got to know Combs while on a “girls’ trip” to Miami in 2020 with a friend who was dating him at the time. Jane said she dated him from 2021 to 2024 in what began as a loving and passionate relationship.', 'While testifying, she dropped her head and appeared to get emotional, wiping away tears, as a prosecutor asked her about a turning point in their relationship: May 2021, when she said Combs started talking to her about his sexual fantasies involving other men and role playing.', 'One night, she acquiesced because it “seemed like he wanted that, and it was turning him on,” and she wanted to make him happy. Within hours, she said, she was in a Miami hotel room watching Combs’ personal assistants setting the space up for a freak-off.', 'Jane’s description of her “hotel nights” with Combs and male sex workers closely paralleled Cassie’s testimony earlier in the trial.

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs ex-girlfriend in tears during testimony over coerced sex with strangers,https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/06/sean-diddy-combs-ex-girlfriend-jane-tears-coerced-sex-with-strangers-freak-offs/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Daily News e-Edition', 'Evening e-Edition', 'TRENDING:', '', '', 'A young single mom who was involved with Sean “Diddy” Combs until his arrest last year said she was habitually sexually exploited by the multimillionaire rap mogul in gut-wrenching testimony at Manhattan Federal Court on Friday.', 'In explicit detail, “Jane,” a pseudonym, described multiple days-long events spent sleeping with strangers in dimly lit hotel rooms as Combs watched, masturbated and plied her with hard drugs. During her testimony, she became so overcome with emotion at times she couldn’t speak.', 'Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey, Jane could not estimate how many men the domineering Combs paired her with over their years together, which ended when the feds arrested him in September 2024. She said Combs decided how many “rounds” of sex with strangers she would engage in, testifying that it was sometimes as many as three.', 'When asked who decided whether she could stop if she got tired during “hours and hours” of sex, Jane said Combs did, and broke down into tears, later saying he would give her ecstasy to stay awake. ', '“He would be, like, ‘You’re not getting tired on me, are you? Let’s finish strong,’” Jane quoted Combs.', 'Jane, a single mom of one who had experience working in the service industry and a couple of modeling gigs before meeting Combs, wept throughout her testimony. She said she felt “obligated” to participate in the degrading sessions, partly because she believed Combs loved her and also because the hip-hop entrepreneur paid her rent but often threatened to cut her off.', '“I felt that at, any given opportunity, Sean was just hovering the house over my head,” Jane testified. “[He] always brought it up in so many ways, that he was paying for it.”', 'Jane said she tried to exercise some agency by choosing which escorts to sleep with and communicated to Combs many times, usually by text, that she didn’t want to participate in the “dark, sleazy” encounters. Between May 2021 and October 2023, she said Combs always reacted the same when she tried to assert herself — “upset, defensive, belittling, dismissive.”', 'Combs’ appetite was insatiable, Jane said. The hotel sessions were so frequent and so intense that the witness said she had urinary tract infections almost weekly. She later testified that she sometimes had to resort to sending Combs pictures of used toilet paper and tampons to prove she was menstruating and unable to participate in sessions.', 'Her voice sounding lifeless, Jane said the longest “hotel night” was over New Year’s in 2022, running for three and a half days. Describing another night in October 2023, she said the plan had been to stay sober, but she ended up taking drugs like ecstasy. After grueling, hours-long sessions with two men, Jane said she vomited in the bathroom, and Combs came to get her. ', '“That’s good, you’ll feel better,” she quoted Combs saying. “Let’s go, the third guy is here.” ', 'Jane is the last of three women the jury will hear from at the trial who allege Combs sexually exploited and psychologically abused them behind closed doors while at the peak of his success. All described their worlds being diminished in his orbit, leaving them incapacitated by low self-esteem and chronic physical exhaustion.', 'Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, Combs’ ex of 11 years, took the stand first and, over four days, described being brutalized in violent beatings, coerced into “hundreds” of dehumanizing sexual performances with men hired off the internet, and isolated from her loved ones while she healed from injuries. Ventura, who was 17 years Combs’ junior and developed a relationship with him after being signed to Bad Boy Records, said Combs orchestrated the sessions he called “freak-offs” and recorded many of them for blackmail. Jane said on Friday that Combs recorded the sessions almost every time on his iPhone, claiming it would be for their eyes only.', 'A former Combs assistant, who testified under the pseudonym “Mia,” said that she was raped and sexually assaulted by Combs multiple times during her employment between 2009 through 2017. She said she was forced to work untenable hours and had little freedom, living at Combs’ properties and requiring permission to leave, even when off the clock.', 'Jane’s accounts mirrored many of those provided by Ventura, such as Combs forcing her to sleep with a stranger on her birthday, dictating when and where men would ejaculate, and peculiar rituals involving escorts’ bodily fluids. Both women said he sought to control their appearances; Jane said Friday that Combs paid for her to get veneers “because he didn’t like my teeth.”', 'Combs also had rules around contraception, Jane said.', '“He better not ask for a f—ing condom,” she quoted Combs once saying about an escort. ', 'As Ventura had also testified, Jane said she felt like Combs pretended she was his girlfriend but was really using her to objectify in the vile sex sessions. She said that was apparent when she saw Instagram posts of him spending quality time with other women after forcing her to stay awake for days on drugs to have sex with other men.', 'Asked about Combs taking another woman on vacation after allegedly coercing her into a particularly brutal hotel session on her birthday, Jane became distraught, saying, “It broke my heart because I just finished spending my birthday with all these guys having sex with me.”', 'The jury heard an audio recording that an irate Combs once sent Jane when she confronted him about his performing romantic gestures for other women while relegating her to degrading sex sessions, calling her “f—in’ nuts.”', '“Be sad, go crazy, do whatever the f— you wanna do,” Combs was heard saying in the recording, a tone Jane said he took with her often.', 'The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office alleges Combs operated a criminal enterprise that saw him and his inner circle of staff resort to crimes like sex trafficking, kidnapping, distributing drugs, exploiting employees for labor and arson from 2004 to 2024. They say his high-ranking employees went to extreme lengths to cover up his crimes and habitual violence and keep his victims isolated and submissive.', 'Jane said on Friday that she saw various secretaries and assistants of Combs bringing a “good amount” of cash to the hotels where Combs would pay escorts to sleep with her, and that staff also “set up” the rooms before the sessions began.', 'Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges including sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transporting individuals for prostitution, and claims he never forced women into sexual performances against their will.

Days later, those funds were returned to sender from Bad Boy.', 'Ventura Fine’s mother, Regina Ventura, previously testified that she was told she needed to wire Combs $20,000 after he threatened to release the tapes of Ventura Fine.

The witness then went to his boss, Bill Medrano, and told him that Combs was offering to pay for the video. Medrano paused and said he would do it for $50,000, Garcia testified.', 'The former officer recalled that Combs ""sounded excited"" over the offer and said, ""Eddy, my angel. I knew you could help.""', 'Medrano went to the server room of the hotel, came back and handed Garcia a black USB, and said ""done.""', 'Garcia testified he told Combs and Khorram he had the tape on March 7, 2016.

When Garcia arrived at the suite, Combs and Khorram were waiting there.', '""I was very nervous and my voice kept cracking,"" Garcia said on the stand.', 'Combs allegedly asked if he had the tape, and Garcia handed him a USB. The former security officer said Combs reiterated that ""he didn\'t want it getting out"" to the public.', 'Garcia testified that he was concerned about being in legal trouble for giving the video to Combs, particularly if Ventura Fine filed a police report. But the former security guard said Combs told him he ""didn’t have to worry about it"" because she ""wanted it gone too.""', 'Combs then called Ventura Fine, who said she ""had a movie coming out"" and wanted the situation to go away, Garcia said.

He also asked Garcia to sign a non-disclosure agreement and another document stating he'd provided the only copy of the video."", 'The courtroom saw an image of the NDA, which said Garcia agreed to pay $1 million if there was a breach of the agreement.', 'After Garcia signed the documents, he said Combs brought him $100,000 in a paper bag. Combs asked how he would spend the money – and allegedly advised him not to ""make any big purchases."" Garcia said he gave $50,000 to Medrano, $22,000 to the other officer and kept $30,000 for himself. He said he bought a used vehicle in cash and didn’t deposit the money in a bank account or report it on taxes.', 'Prosecutors are trying to use some of the phone calls that Combs has made from jail as evidence.

The former assistant testified under a pseudonym to protect her privacy and safeguard against retaliation."", 'The individual went on his YouTube channel and used Mia’s real name there as well, prosecutors said. The person has been banned from the courthouse. ', 'Before the jury entered the courtroom for the day, there was an outburst from an onlooker.', 'A woman stood up and shouted ""Diddy!"" and Combs turned around and looked at her.

If Combs admits he used physical violence in his relationship with Ventura Fine, some jurors could believe he\'s admitting he forced her into the alleged ""freak offs.""', '""If somebody is being beaten before or after sexual encounters, and knows that that is just a consistent part of their relationship, that really extinguishes any concept of consent,"" Moira Penza, a litigator who in 2019 successfully prosecuted the so-called NXIVM ""sex cult"" leader Keith Raniere for sex trafficking, told USA TODAY.', ""Combs' defense team didn't respond to a request for comment on whether it believes it is having to thread a needle by conceding domestic violence while denying he trafficked anyone. But it has tried to demonstrate that alleged victims had agency."", 'Mia, a former personal assistant who worked for Combs from 2009 to 2017, testified on May 29 that he sexually assaulted her on ""more than one"" occasion.

Kelly, a fellow hip-hop artist, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering in 2022.

But that doesn't mean he can't. According to Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt, Trump would be within his presidential rights to extend a preemptive pardon to Combs."", '""These are federal charges so that\'s the main limit,"" Kalt tells USA TODAY.

"Diddy's Ex-Girlfriend Sobs In Court, Saying He Ignored Her Pleas To End Sex Marathons",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-sexual-misconduct-diddy_n_68433e5ae4b043146daabba9,"['', 'NEW YORK (AP) — A woman who was dating Sean “Diddy” Combs at the time of his arrest last year broke down Friday describing their many drug-fueled sex marathons, saying the music mogul ignored her signals to stop and scolded her for crying after another encounter.', 'Testifying under the pseudonym “Jane” for a second day, the woman recounted how Combs pushed her to continue having sex with men while he watched even after she gave “subtle cues” — saying she was tired and hungry, making faces and gestures — that she wanted to stop. Instead, she said, he told her to “finish strong.”', 'Asked why she didn’t tell him outright, Jane sobbed, “I just, I don’t know.” Later, she said Combs would shut her down when she tried to talk about ending the encounters, which she called “dark” and “sleazy.”', 'Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to running his business empire as a racketeering enterprise that enabled and concealed the abuse of women over two decades. If convicted, he faces 15 years to life. The defense has asserted the sexual activities were all consensual and nothing Combs did amounted to a criminal enterprise.', 'Jane’s account in the trial’s fourth week has closely mirrored that of R&B singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, another former girlfriend who testified Combs assaulted her and forced her into “hundreds” of encounters with male sex workers dubbed “ freak-offs.” Jane called them “hotel nights” and the men “entertainers.”', 'Prosecutor Maurene Comey sought to show that Combs used his wealth to manipulate women into submitting to his sexual demands and make them reliant on him and his needs. By September 2023, Jane said, Combs had been paying her rent for about five months. Asked what she feared would happen if she stopped doing hotel nights, Jane replied, “That Sean would take the house away.” Combs is still paying her rent, Jane said.', 'After one such hotel encounter, Jane said she cried and Combs told her “Don’t do that right now,” and “I can’t do this right now. I’m too high.” She testified she’d blacked out earlier from the drug ecstasy that Combs gave her.', 'During another encounter, she tried to remain sober but vomited in a bathroom after having sex with two men in a row. Combs told her, “That’s good. You’ll feel better now that you’ve thrown up. So let’s go.” She then had sex with a third man, describing herself as “repulsed.”', 'Jane said she endured the encounters because she valued time alone with Combs afterward. “I would really fight to block out how sad I was after,” she testified. In messages to him, she wrote: “my heart is really in this and it’s breaking.”', 'Jane wiped away tears as she recounted the many ill-effects of hotel nights, including constant back pain, frequent urinary tract infections and soreness in her genitals and pelvic areas. Cassie testified she also suffered UTIs after enduring sex marathons involving Combs and male sex workers.', 'Jane dated Combs from 2021 to 2024. On Thursday, she testified their relationship began as loving and passionate but soon veered into having her engage in sex with other men. The longest lasted three and a half days, while most went on for 24 to 30 hours.', 'On Friday, she said she poured her thoughts into the Notes app on her phone in November 2021, drafting a message to Combs but never sending it.', '“I don’t know what you’re calling me for, but I’m sorry I don’t want to do drugs for days and days and have you use me to fulfill your freaky, wild desires in hotel rooms,” Jane wrote in the unsent missive.', 'In 2023, she said she texted Combs to say she longed to return to the early days of their relationship and regretted ever getting involved in the sexual encounters, but felt obligated. Combs responded: “Girl, stop,” she said.', 'Jane said the encounters continued into 2024 and she participated in one at Combs’ Miami-area estate as late as August — just weeks before his arrest at a Manhattan hotel.', 'Jurors on Friday heard the first audio from inside one of those encounters. In the recording, Jane asked a man to wear a condom during her first hotel night, but Combs “guilt tripped me out of it. It wasn’t something he wanted to see.”', 'Jane also said Combs had her act as his drug mule at least twice, nervously smuggling pills in her checked luggage on commercial flights from Los Angeles to Miami. She said he divvied up in the colorful pills into bottles, and she ended up using some of the drugs with him.', 'To protect Jane’s anonymity, the judge has barred courtroom observers from describing or sketching her appearance in a way that would reveal her identity. The Associated Press does not identify people who say they’re victims of sexual abuse unless they choose to make their names public, as Cassie has done.', 'Combs’ lawyers have tried to sew doubt among jurors about the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses. In opening arguments, lawyer Teny Geragos acknowledged Combs had a “bad temper” and violent outbursts, but argued his sexual habits were part of a consensual swinger lifestyle.', 'The defense painted Cassie, for example, as an eager participant in the freak-offs. When Cassie was on the stand, Combs’ lawyers had her read texts and emails in which she expressed willingness to engage in the encounters.', 'Before Jane began testifying on Thursday, the defense cross-examined Bryana “Bana” Bongolan, a friend of Cassie and a graphic designer who is suing Combs. Bongolan testified that in 2016, Combs held her over the edge of a balcony at a Los Angeles high-rise for 10 to 15 seconds, an episode she said traumatized her and left her with lasting night terrors.', 'Defense attorney Nicole Westmoreland suggested that Bongolan lied or exaggerated. The lawyer noted Combs was on tour for much of September 2016, including East Coast shows around the time of the balcony incident. Bongolan later testified she didn’t recall the exact date of the incident, but had no doubt it occurred.', ""For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
