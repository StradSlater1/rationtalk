"Rachel Reeves is undermined by a ‘spend now, pay later’ prime minister",https://www.the-independent.com/voices/rachel-reeves-spending-pm-keir-starmer-b2766301.html,"['', '', 'John Rentoul says Sir Keir Starmer is guilty of Trussonomics, albeit on a smaller scale, making promises without knowing how to pay for them – hoping that the chancellor can sort it out later', 'T\nhe spending review will be mostly about making explicit bad news that has not yet been spelt out. The total for planned public spending over the next three years has already been set: what Rachel Reeves will announce in the House of Commons on Wednesday is how much has been allocated to each department.', 'Hence the distraction of announcing capital spending projects around the country, as Reeves did on her trip to Rochdale this week. Perhaps she was hoping that the short attention spans of journalists meant that they had forgotten she changed her fiscal rules in the Budget in October to allow more capital investment. That was when she sensibly excluded investment that will earn a return from the annual limit on how much the government can borrow.', 'She did win some headlines this week about “tearing up the rule book” to invest in transport projects outside the south-east, although some journalists with longer memories – or better internet search techniques – did point out that the projects she announced were identical to those unveiled by Rishi Sunak two years ago.', 'None of them will even start until 2027, so there will be no actual new roads or trams before the next election, but Labour MPs in the relevant places will at least have something to put on their leaflets.', 'Another part of the spin cycle before the spending review is confirmation that NHS spending will rise by 2.8 per cent a year more than inflation over the three-year period. This is not enough to ensure that Wes Streeting will hit Labour’s target of treating 92 per cent of patients within 18 weeks by the end of this parliament. However, Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, otherwise known as the Source of the Impartial Truth, described it as “a serious, meaningful increase in health funding”.', 'However, outside the NHS and defence, the spending review is a wasteland of tough choices.', 'Reeves wrote an article for The Independent on Thursday defending her decisions as “Labour choices”. But the essential fact of the review is that nothing has changed. It will simply become clearer, when the chancellor addresses the Commons on Wednesday, how tough some of those choices are.', 'She and Sir Keir are trapped in the same positions that chancellors and prime ministers always find themselves in – No 10 always wants to spend more and No 11 always has to say no. The personal relationships are different, but the underlying tension is always the same. Starmer and Reeves work well together. They are not friends, as David Cameron and George Osborne were, but neither are they dysfunctional rivals like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.', 'They occupy a middle position: Starmer does not think that Reeves is after his job, and Reeves knows that she is secure because it would be disastrous for Starmer to move her – sacking his chancellor would in effect be admitting that their joint strategy was a mistake.', 'But the underlying tension, baked into the British constitution, is still there. When the prime minister last month announced the U-turn on the winter fuel payment, Reeves allowed it to be known that she had suggested it first. That is presumably what the papers will show when they go to the National Archives, but the reality is that the pressure came from No 10 and she bent to it.', 'The retreat from the two-child limit on benefits was messier, but the shape was the same. Starmer wants to appease the opposition, from both Labour MPs and Nigel Farage, and expects Reeves to find the money.', 'For all that Starmer attacks Farage for his unfunded fantasy tax cuts and spending promises, the prime minister is engaged in a bit of low-level Trussonomics himself, making promises without knowing how to pay for them – and hoping that the chancellor can sort it out later.', 'No one has the faintest idea how she will do it. She is going to find herself trapped. On Wednesday, she will set out spending choices that will please no one, setting up the long wait until the Budget in October or November, in which she will have to deal with the growing gap between expected revenue and the spending plans that she has just laid out.', 'The prime minister has helpfully ruled out tax rises. He said on Monday, “I don’t think you can tax your way to growth. We have high tax as it is.” But on Wednesday, the chancellor will, by implication, be ruling out spending cuts – or what is the point of announcing spending plans for three years if you are going to change them just four or five months later?', 'It is beginning to look as if the government plans to cross its fingers and hope for a miracle. Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff, has had some success in ensuring message discipline, getting all ministers to repeat the phrase “the Plan for Change” as often as possible.', 'By the time of the Budget this autumn, however, the slogan might be that it is time for “a Change of Plan”.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhWVzVSV0RNelpsVllRMnQxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZFpvUUxNZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df

What will the Spending Review mean for NI public services?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87j28822yeo,"['Next week the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will reveal the outcome of her Spending Review.', 'It will allocate money to day-to-day public services for the next three years.', 'It will also set infrastructure budgets for the next four years.', 'The review will directly impact on what Stormont Ministers have to spend on public services in Northern Ireland.', 'Last year Reeves set what is known as the ""spending envelope"" – the amount by which total government spending will change in a given period.', 'Day-to-day spending is planned to grow by an average of 1.2% above the rate of inflation each year for the next three years.', 'Infrastructure spending is planned to grow by 1.3% above inflation a year over the next four years.', 'These are much lower growth rates than this year and last year, reflecting the new government\'s ""emergency"" injection of cash into the health service and public sector pay deals.', 'On Wednesday the Chancellor will break it down further, making allocations to each central government department.', ""The precise allocation of this money matters for Stormont's spending plans."", 'More than 90% of what Stormont ministers have to spend comes from the Treasury through what is known as ""the block grant.""', 'The increase in the block grant is worked out using a calculation known as the Barnett formula, which is based on the annual changes in UK central government departmental budgets.', 'It gives Stormont an equivalent spending increase for the size of the NI population, adjusted for the extent to which each service is devolved.', 'Some services, like health, are almost entirely devolved but defence is not devolved.', 'If the government decides it is going to spend more on defence at the expense of other services that will have an impact on the amount of extra money in the Stormont pot.', 'In simple terms: If the UK Department of Health sees its budget increase by £100m, then Northern Ireland would get approximately £3m extra.', 'If the Ministry of Defence budget increases by £100m Stormont does not get anything extra.', 'When devolution was restored in 2024 the government agreed a financial package which included an automatic top-up of any money awarded by the Barnett formula.', 'The government was persuaded that the level of need in Northern Ireland means it requires spending of £124 per head for every £100 per head spent in England.', 'As Northern Ireland was funded below that level, the government said that in future every £1 that comes through the Barnett formula will now come with an extra 24p.', 'That will apply until the overall level of funding need is reached.', 'The independent Fiscal Council has estimated that will be worth £815m over five years.', 'The government said the size of the top up could be reviewed if ""independent and credible sources"" provide evidence.', 'To that end the Executive commissioned a study from the economist Prof Gerry Holtham, an expert in the devolution of public finances.', 'The BBC understands that his work has come back with a range of possible funding need.', 'The central estimates are £123 per head, for every £100 spent in England, if agricultural spending is excluded and £128 per head if agriculture forms part of the calculation.', 'If the Treasury is persuaded to accept the higher end of the range it will be worth tens of millions of pounds extra over the next five years.', 'The devolution financial package also brought a large dollop of one-off UK government funding, largely to pay for public sector pay deals.', 'However that creates a cliff-edge drop in Stormont funding of about £500m in 2026/27 when that short term money runs out.', 'The government committed to review ""concerns about 2026-27 funding"" at the Spending Review.', ""The Fiscal Council has suggested options to tackle the cliff edge could include more one-off funding or setting a new, higher baseline for Stormont's budget."", 'However, it is also possible that the normal operation of Spending Review will allocate enough money to largely remove the cliff edge.', 'The Chancellor will be allocating trillions of pounds in the Spending Review but it is a tiny fraction of that which may have most political impact in Northern Ireland.', 'There is a growing expectation that the UK government will come up with additional money for the construction of a new GAA stadium at Casement Park in Belfast.', 'That project has been bogged down in

The spending review will reveal how far the government has been blown off course,https://www.the-independent.com/voices/spending-review-treasury-yvette-cooper-home-office-b2766392.html,"['', '', 'In her last-man-standing battle with the Treasury, Yvette Cooper has shone a light on how Starmer’s administration is now quietly tacking to the left, says Sean O’Grady', ""From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'A\nccording to what we read, the last holdout in the current set of negotiations with the Treasury about public spending plans is the Home Office, where the secretary of state, Yvette Cooper, hasn’t yet agreed her plans for the next three years with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.', 'Apparently, there’s more cash for the police, although maybe not as much as they’d like (it never is, of course), but certainly not for much else. Given that Cooper is responsible for one of the most politically important jobs in government, getting migration down to levels acceptable to the right-wing media, she’s right to be putting up a bit of a fight.', 'There can be no question of impropriety, but I wonder if, in all of this, I detect the guiding hand of someone else in the Cooper household?', 'Mr Yvette Cooper is better known as Ed Balls, he knows how the Treasury works – and he’s been intimately involved in the spending review process from both sides. He was the closest of confidants to Gordon Brown when the former Labour PM was chancellor, then as a Treasury minister, education secretary and, for what it’s worth, shadow chancellor and co-star of a podcast about politics with George Osborne.', 'Maybe, over the years – and without breaking protocol or the ministerial code, perish the thought – the Balls-Coopers have honed their considerable political skills mutually.', 'Indeed, Cooper herself served as a Treasury minister under Brown, and sat in his cabinet with her husband, when she was holding the purse strings at the Treasury, and he was pleading for more resources to give every child the best start in life. These days, Balls interviews her on ITV as if she were just another of Starmer’s ministers he might be vaguely acquainted with. I wonder if they still go on date nights.', 'At any rate, Cooper plainly doesn’t need that much advice, and she’s worked out that her best tactic is to dig her heels in and take it to the brink. It’s interesting to see these various big and middleweight beasts in the cabinet slog it out because it suggests that the Treasury under Reeves isn’t as powerful as it once was, weakened by her own misjudgments of the past year.', 'Indeed, the institution is not as powerful as in the days when Brown and Balls were running it, in the high noon of New Labour. In those days, the central command and control was pretty much complete, albeit there was more money about. At the time of the 1998 comprehensive spending review (CSR), for example, one close observer at the time described the process thus: “The CSR was a triumph for a strong prime minister and a strong chancellor, working together. Nothing illustrates this more clearly than the brutality of its execution. The two just called in ministers and told them how much they were getting. There was no appeal.”', 'How different to today!', 'Starmer, like Reeves, certainly started as a strong prime minister, but a combination of errors of judgment by him and by his chancellor have seen his personal ratings slump. He was actually never that highly rated as a leader, even when Labour was 20 points ahead in the polls. Now that he’s hitting record lows and lags 10 points behind the ultimate catastrophe – Nigel Farage as prime minister of a Reform UK government – people are getting real, and getting nervous.', 'The Starmer-Reeves axis should be, and is, “institutionally” strong in the British system – but the reality is they are both politically weak, both in it together and tied together by outrageous misfortune.', 'So they get pushed around far more than Blair and Brown did, for example. Not only has Cooper been able to drag out the process, but so has Angela Rayner, who, unlike Reeves (but like Brown), is actually the second most powerful figure in the party and the government.', 'Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, seems to have been able to exert some leverage, although Reeves seems more sympathetic to the plight of our schools than much else. Liz Kendall, rather like Harriet Harman in the New Labour government, seems to operate social security policy as an arm of the Treasury anyway. Defence secretary John Healey and Wes Streeting at health and social care are in the blessed position of not having to beg too hard.', 'So what we see now is a dramatic, destabilising situation whereby a combination of an undeniably miserable economic position and relatively weak leadership is altering the centre of gravity within the governing party and, before our very eyes, changing its course.', 'For all the talk about tough choices and the squeals of anguish from their cabinet colleagues, Starmer and Reeves are gradually moving away from the kind of Cameron-Osborne “fix the roof while the sun is shining” devotion to the public finances, and edging towards a more tax-and-spend welfare agenda where, almost out of nowhere, a newfound mission to eradicate child poverty has suddenly seized them. Now, they act left as well as talk left.', 'Well, you can exaggerate that, and the Tories no doubt will, because the real pain comes not from some sado-masochism in the Treasury but from Britain’s dangerously dismal growth prospects. The pie isn’t getting much bigger, but everyone wants and needs more, and so we end up, as a nation (and mixing the metaphor), fighting like rats in a sack. It’s only a question of which rats are cunning enough to run away with a few extra crumbs, which is really what Cooper is trying to extract.

Reeves has left herself with only one way of funding her spending promises,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/06/09/rachel-reeves-has-made-tax-rises-inevitable/,"['By giving in to Left-wing ideology, the Chancellor has made tax rises all but inevitable', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'This Wednesday, Rachel Reeves will be in the firing line once again.', 'The event in question will not be a Budget, or even a mini-Budget, but rather a spending review. But such is the pressure on the public finances that the political and economic ramifications will be significant.', 'On the face of it, this review is meant to spell out the details of departmental spending within the overall totals that have already been set to 2028/29 for current day-to-day spending and to 2029/30 for capital spending.', 'Such reviews are not, therefore, meant to be the vehicle for announcing major changes in fiscal policy.', 'There is now supposedly only one major fiscal event for this purpose, namely the autumn Budget, with a subsidiary event, the Spring Statement, which was delivered in March.', 'That said, it would not come as a surprise if the Chancellor increased the spending totals on Wednesday.', 'After all, if defence spending is increased to 3pc of GDP (costing over £17bn per annum by 2029/30) and spending on health increases by 3.4pc in real terms per annum, this would imply that other departments would have to suffer an average real terms reduction in their budgets of 1.8pc per annum out to the end of the review period.', 'Good luck with selling that to the Labour Party.', 'Admittedly, although at one point increasing defence spending to 3pc of GDP was supposedly a “commitment”, more recently it seems to have been downgraded to an “ambition”.', 'But any leeway you might think this gives is surely undermined by the fact that at last week’s Nato meeting in Brussels, there was a call for defence spending of 3.5pc of GDP. And Donald Trump’s representative called for the figure to be 5pc.', 'Meanwhile, several recent policy announcements and events have come together to intensify pressure on the Chancellor. It will be interesting to see what she has to say about these on Wednesday and how they can possibly be squared with the existing plans.', 'If she makes no announcements on these matters, then the detailed spending plans that she announces on Wednesday may be viewed as decidedly preliminary.', 'Some of the fiscal pressures on the Chancellor reflect political choices. The Government has announced pay rises for public sector workers in England of between 3 and 5pc in this fiscal year, rather higher than the 2.8pc that the Chancellor had budgeted for. These higher increases will cost up to £3bn.', 'It is no secret that the lurch by Reform UK towards Left-wing economic policies has driven the Government towards increased spending commitments.', 'We don’t yet know the full details, but if the Government were to fully reverse the cut to winter fuel payments, the cost would be about £1.7bn. Similarly, under pressure from both Nigel Farage and a significant number of its own backbenchers, the Government is reportedly considering removing the two-child cap on benefits. This would cost another £3.5bn.', 'Meanwhile, a softening of the welfare cuts announced in March would probably cost a further £500m.', 'On a different front, the Government’s new migration policy is expected to reduce migration “by up to around 100,000 per annum”. Whatever you might think of the desirability of such a change, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) would score such a cut as reducing our GDP and thereby raising the likely level of public borrowing, perhaps by about £6bn by 2029/30.', 'Not all the upward pressures on borrowing come from policy decisions. Since March, market interest rate expectations and gilt yields have risen. If this were sustained, then come the Budget in the autumn, another £4bn would have to be devoted to servicing the Government’s debt.', 'Over and above this, the OBR could conceivably reduce its forecast for productivity growth. Believe it or not, it has persistently been optimistic about productivity growth, only to be repeatedly proved wrong. At some point, it may well throw in the towel. A reduction of only 0.1pc per year would raise the annual borrowing forecast by about £10bn.', 'The combination of spending increases of over £25bn and an upward revision to the OBR’s borrowing forecast of just over £20bn would leave the Chancellor facing a fiscal “hole” of about £46bn. Unlike before last year’s Budget, she may well find this deficit trickier to blame on the previous Conservative government.', 'The Chancellor might well find a bit of wiggle room by tweaking the fiscal rules. After all, in its most recent report, the International Monetary Fund suggested that there might be scope to go down this route.', 'Nevertheless, it seems unlikely she would be able to raise more than about £20bn this way, leaving her with perhaps about £25bn still to find. And she needs to keep a watchful eye on the gilt market. As far as it is concerned, borrowing is borrowing.', 'It is no surprise, therefore, that there is much speculation that huge tax rises are in the offing, perhaps including an extension of the planned freeze on personal tax thresholds by an additional two years, raising about £10bn. There are umpteen other potential personal tax measures that could raise substantial sums.', 'Given that Reform has made much of being able to raise umpteen billions from ending the practice of paying interest on commercial banks’ reserves at the Bank of England, however, it would be tempting to shoot their fox.', 'Yet all these calculations assume a relatively small increase in defence spending. If we had to increase defence spending to 5pc of GDP, or even higher, surely the welfare budget would have to give.', 'The Government must be hoping that President Putin’s designs on Nato territory amount to just an “ambition”, rather than a “commitment”.', 'Roger Bootle is senior independent adviser to Capital Economics and a senior fellow at Policy Exchange. roger.bootle@capitaleconomics.com', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhWVzVSV0RNelpsVllRMnQxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZFpvUUxNZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df
Rachel Reeves must think big to fund Labour’s ‘battle-ready’ Britain. Tweaks and tinkering won’t do,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/03/rachel-reeves-think-big-labour-battle-ready-britain-defence-fund,"['The whole tax and spending ship is an unseaworthy rustbucket. This spending review is a chance to fix it', 'W\nho in their right mind would want to be Rachel Reeves right now? Her spending review out next week will feel like austerity all over again. Even if, in reality, it’s not a cut but more spending, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies emphasises. After an uplift in everyday spending at the budget, here comes a much-needed capital slab of £113bn. Yet whatever the numbers say, painful cuts to most things will be the story and the feeling.', 'If you want to try your hand, the IFS has just put its “Be the Chancellor” gadget up on its site. Strap yourself into Reeves’s fiscal straitjacket and attempt a Houdini-like escape, as you decide on levels of borrowing, taxing, spending and debt. One thing it illuminates is how much even mere slivers of growth improve your position immensely. How far can you go? The febrile market meltdown point is unknowable, but Liz Truss was a useful crash dummy testing squillions on tax cuts without raising revenue. Donald Trump, plunging into an unexplored fiscal wilderness, beat a retreat when his monster tariffs sent the markets charging back out at him. He seems to be having another try.', 'One reason not to want to be chancellor is that Reeves inherited public services and the economy in their worst state in recent memory. The £22bn black hole was a fraction of the true deficit, as every minister soon revealed the bleeding stumps of their stricken department after years of cuts. How do you weigh up hungry children, inadequate home insulation, councils bankrupted by social care and special educational needs funding, meagre social housing, and stretched policing and courts? None will get enough, some will get cut.', 'These choices are the breath of politics: no wonder Labour MPs look so drawn, Survation finding 65% of them think the government should change course on fiscal policy to fund public investment and spending. At the weekend Compass conference, Labour’s soft left keened over vacillations and slow progress.', 'At the same time, Starmer’s commitment to be “battle-ready” means huge defence spending. Monday’s strategic defence review commits not just to defending Nato countries facing imminent danger from Vladimir Putin, but rebinding us to the Europe we walked out on. It means defending our own endangered undersea cables, vulnerable internet and critical facilities. It’s “a new era”, Keir Starmer said. “The world has changed.” Yes, indeed. And so must the government on tax and spending.', 'More revenue must be raised, and the answer is not more tweaks. The whole tax and spending ship is an unseaworthy rustbucket encrusted with barnacles, in need not of a lick of paint but of stripping down and rebuilding. Adjustments seeking small sums deliver maximum political pain, and minimal financial gain. Tempting tax loopholes turned out to be strewn with political landmines: farmers sitting on undertaxed millions in land wealth, or well-off pensioners in no need of winter fuel allowances are explosive when set off.

These one-offs have not been worth the row.', 'Helen Miller, incoming director of the IFS, suggests to me that tackling the big questions would be a better approach. She’s right. Labour may as well grasp worthwhile reform, since the poison press and social media assaults them just as brutally over small things.', 'Here’s a truly difficult example: Miller would end VAT reliefs for things like food, books and children’s clothes, which benefit the rich as they spend most. The total take foregone by the various VAT relief schemes is a stonking £100bn.

The Department of Health and Social Care takes around 40% of day-to-day spending, the majority of that on the NHS. It’s dangerous to ask if we need every new drug and treatment. The NHS draws cash away from underfunded education, yet we never dare discuss this clash of interests. Older people use the NHS most: 32% of the spend is on those aged between 65 and 84 (16% of the population) with another 10% on over-85s (3% of the population), according to Full Fact. Yet the future depends on better early years, great schools, further education colleges, skills and apprenticeships.', 'Investing in human capital brings longer-lasting national growth than bricks and mortar, as education and skills are passed for ever down the generations.

The defence review demands more contribution. If money isn’t raised elsewhere, defence risks eating into everything. “Change” was why Labour got elected, but voters don’t see or feel it, and nor do hang-dog Labour MPs. The fiscal straitjacket has come to be a signal to voters, indicating “no change”. Yet the Institute for Government points out the rules permit Reeves to suspend them “in the event of a ‘significant negative shock’,” while noting “it is at the Treasury’s discretion to define what constitutes such a shock”. Her own spending review will show how Trump, tariffs and emergency defence spending cause a deeply “negative shock” to everything else.', 'Labour has suffered the biggest dip in popularity within its first 10 months of any newly elected UK government in 40 years.

Sir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, and other senior police officers have also written to the prime minister to warn him that investment was need to prevent some crimes being routinely ignored. It is understood the policing budget will not face real terms cuts but the level of spending is still under discussion.', 'The Home Office is under strain as a major spending department that is key to some of the most ambitious manifesto pledges – including halving knife crime, police recruitment, reducing violence against women and girls as well as dealing with monitoring offenders who will be released earlier due to sentencing changes.', 'The other major spending review row is over deep dissatisfaction from Angela Rayner – the deputy prime minister and housing secretary – with the level of funding for social homes in the spending review, making her one of the last remaining holdouts in negotiations with the Treasury over departmental spending settlements.', 'The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been battling for more funding for the affordable homes programme as well as trying to preserve cash for local councils, homelessness and regional growth initiatives.', 'The Treasury had previously put £2bn into affordable housing, described as a “down payment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review, which Reeves said would mark a generational shift in the building of council homes.', 'However, the next phase of funding has caused a major rift with Rayner – and more so because capital spending on infrastructure such as housing is meant to be a priority.', 'The environment secretary, Steve Reed, is said to have been holding out for a big capital injection to fund flood defences. The autumn budget said the government was facing significant funding pressures on flood defences and farm schemes of almost £600m in 2024-25, and that those schemes would have to be reviewed for their affordability.', 'Sources at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed a post-Brexit farming fund would be cut in the review. Labour promised a fund of £5bn over two years – from 2024 to 2026 – at the budget, which is being honoured, but in the years after that it will be slashed for all but a few farms.', 'The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, had a long fight to keep cash for a major programme of insulation, which was a key part of the government’s net zero strategy. However, there are reports suggesting other schemes could be scaled back to protect the insulation programme.', 'At the October budget, Reeves announced £3.4bn over three years for household energy efficiency schemes, heat decarbonisation and fuel poverty schemes.

The department will get one of the biggest boosts to funding as others face real-terms cuts.', 'The funding for the plan prioritises three key areas, moving care from hospitals to communities, increasing the use of technology, and prioritising prevention.', 'No 10 and Streeting hope that the 10-year plan will contain major commitments and a positive story that the government will finally be able to tell properly on improvements to the health service – though any good news could be scuppered by the ballot for strike action by resident doctors.', 'Still, Streeting’s department was one of the last to settle formally with the Treasury due to negotiations over drug prices, though departmental sources downplayed any specific row.', 'Any child in England whose parents receive universal credit will be able to claim free school meals from September 2026, the government has said. Parents on the credit will be eligible regardless of their income.

Day-to-day departmental spending, known in Treasury parlance as RDEL, bobbled around £300bn a year between 2010 and 2019 before shooting up during the Covid pandemic and subsequent energy crisis to hit £423bn in 2023-4.', 'Last autumn’s budget, let’s not forget, included a stonking £40bn-a-year tax increase and bumped up RDEL to an estimated £481bn for the current financial year, a significant jump that prompted thinktanks to increase their forecasts for economic growth.', 'The growth rate of spending at the back end of the parliament will be considerably lower after this early jolt, and the voracious demands of health and defence will force difficult decisions. But austerity this is not. By the end of the parliament, Labour expects RDEL to be more than £540bn a year.', 'News that schools spending per pupil will reach its highest ever level in real terms is an example of what the government wants to do with the extra resources it is making available.', 'The unfortunate truth for Reeves and her colleagues, though, is that two things can be true at the same time: the uplift in spending she has outlined is significant and will make a real difference, but it is not enough to meet the scale of the challenges the UK faces.', 'While the government is rightly trumpeting a jump in public investment, for example, current plans show departmental capital budgets declining in real terms in the final two years of the parliament. It seems hard to imagine that being plausible, given the crumbling state of many hospitals, prisons and schools. The “moral mission” of tackling child poverty, which Reeves has talked about, may also demand additional resources.', 'The government badly needed a clearer story from the outset about what it wanted to achieve. But it will need it all the more if, as seems increasingly likely, it decides to come back to the country with more tax rises.', 'Voters don’t just want to hear the what (filling the “black hole” in the public finances) but also the why.', 'The economist Mariana Mazzucato – whose idea of the “mission economy” Keir Starmer borrowed to create his cross-party, thematic approach to government – last week put her finger on one reason Labour may have struggled to explain its purpose.', 'Speaking at a conference hosted by the IPPR thinktank, she said a primary mistake had been to try to make restoring economic growth a mission in itself.', '“Growth is not a mission,” she said. “The whole point about missions was to stop just talking about growth, focus on the problems, and design the solutions to those problems in such a way that drives not just the rate of growth but the direction.”', 'She added: “In a country like this one, where the private sector does not invest enough … missions should be designed in such a way to catalyse that missing private-sector investment. And so, starting with the problems, whether it’s net zero, whether it’s health problems for cities, whether it’s problems like knife crime, having really clear goals that you can actually answer yes or no, did we achieve it?’”', 'Mazzucato argued that Labour’s aspiration to become a clean-energy powerhouse was the only one of its five “missions” that might qualify as such by her definition.', 'Sign up to Business Today', ""Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning"", '', 'She suggested that defence, too, which if pursued strategically could catalyse research and development and create jobs in a targeted way in left-behind areas, had mission-like characteristics. Economic growth for its own sake, not so much.', 'Another reason Reeves now needs to remind the public what she stands for results from a sombre pre-election rebrand aimed at overcoming voters’ preconceptions about having a woman – specifically, a Labour woman – in charge of the country’s purse strings.', 'One Labour pollster recalls a focus group early in Reeves’s tenure as shadow chancellor when she had visited a construction site with Starmer, and one voter wanted to know: “Why has he taken his wife with him?”', 'The sharp suits, serious demeanour and relentless focus on tough choices are a riposte to this kind of regrettable “Rachel from accounts” nonsense, but they have resulted in a reductive idea of what Reeves stands for.', 'Expect to hear more on Wednesday, then, about the scourge of child poverty, as well as the need to tool up to face the changed geopolitical context – and to rebalance the economy away from London and the south-east.', 'Even if she sticks with current spending plans for the rest of the parliament, Reeves may yet have to make more tax increases in the autumn. It looks increasingly likely the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will decide to downgrade its projections for productivity growth.', 'The consultancy Oxford Economics suggests that if the OBR moves into line with the consensus on productivity – and cuts its growth forecasts as a result – it would leave the chancellor having to find an extra £20bn a year.', 'Given that she is determined not to abandon her fiscal rules, that would mean tax increases. Reeves will need to be ready to tell a compelling story about why these are necessary.

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'R\nachel Reeves has an unenviable task as she puts the final touches to the government-wide spending review she will unveil on Wednesday. It will be a defining moment for the Labour government as she sets out departmental spending limits up to the next general election.', 'The headlines garnered in the run-up to the chancellor’s big day are misleading. We have been promised £15.6bn for local transport projects, mainly in the North and Midlands; £4.5bn a year for schools; £22.5bn a year for science and tech, and £187m to bring digital skills and AI learning into classrooms and communities.', 'While all are worthy, the government is playing a rather cynical game. Some of its pre-announcements stem from the extra £113bn of capital spending for which Ms Reeves created room last October by sensibly changing her fiscal rules so investment projects do not count towards her target to balance revenue and spending by 2029-30.', 'However, her determination to stick to her fiscal rules to prevent a wobble on the financial markets means that Wednesday’s statement will impose a squeeze on day-to-day budgets. Although overall spending will rise by an average of 1.2 per cent a year on top of inflation, big increases for health and defence will mean real-terms cuts for other budgets, possibly including the Home Office (which funds the police), housing and local government. So there has been a bruising round of negotiations between the Treasury and ministers such as Angela Rayner, who is responsible for housing and councils, and Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. During a media round on Sunday, Peter Kyle, the science secretary, did not rule out real-terms cuts to the police and housing.', 'While the squeeze will technically be less severe than the austerity over which George Osborne presided from 2010, the danger for Labour is that it will feel like austerity 2.0 for many voters. Labour backbenchers are well aware of this and, after the party’s poor results in last month’s local elections in England, have pushed ministers into a U-turn on Ms Reeves’s disastrous decision to means-test the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and extracted a promise from Sir Keir Starmer of more measures to combat child poverty, possibly by easing the two-child limit on benefits.', 'There could also be a tweak to the £5bn of cuts to disability and sickness benefits hurriedly announced in March.', 'The government must prioritise the fight against child poverty; without intervention by ministers, it would rise significantly over the five-year parliament, which would be an indictment of Labour. Ms Reeves must find a way to make good her promise in her article for The Independent last week to ensure “every young person can fulfil their potential”.', 'Admittedly, that will not be easy, given all the conflicting pressures on her to spend more. Although Wednesday’s statement will not be a Budget, Ms Reeves should do more than rattle off a list of spending commitments without making clear where the money will come from. There is already a risk of doing so on defence. The strategic defence review unveiled last week is based on the government’s ambition to raise defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP in the next parliament but it has not yet allocated the funds to go beyond a rise from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent by 2027. The UK will come under pressure to commit to 3.5 per cent at a Nato summit later this month.', 'Ms Reeves should also provide clarity on which pensioners will receive winter fuel payments in the coming winter. The about-turn has been slow and messy, to the consternation of Labour MPs.', 'In responding to such pressures, the chancellor and prime minister have cited the economy’s 0.7 per cent growth in the first quarter of this year but there is no guarantee that will be maintained. They should not lose sight of the need to balance higher spending with genuine public sector reform. There will be a limit to how much can be achieved through “efficiency savings”.', 'The suspicion is that, in spending more on defence, winter fuel payments and child poverty, Sir Keir and Ms Reeves are willing the ends without providing the means. They should level with the public about how their sums will add up.', 'For now, they may be tempted to adopt a Micawberish approach in the hope that the fiscal picture improves by Ms Reeves’s second Budget in the autumn.

Rachel Reeves’s spending review will reveal what this government’s priorities really are,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/06/rachel-reeves-spending-review-government-britain,"['For decades, the savings from declining defence spending were effectively ploughed into the health service. Those ‘peace dividend’ days are gone', 'Helen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies', 'O\nn 11 June, the government will unveil its long-awaited spending review, laying out how it wants to spend more than £600bn annually on public services over the next few years. That’s about a fifth of the entire British economy. The choices made over funding for the NHS, schools, courts, prisons and much more besides will shape life in the UK in the coming years. It’s no exaggeration to say this could be the defining domestic policy moment of this parliament.', 'Rachel Reeves’s first budget included a big tax rise and a two-year increase in borrowing to boost spending on public services. For future years, the chancellor has repeatedly reaffirmed her “ironclad” commitment to borrow only to invest. Such is the dismal state of the public finances that even with tax revenues that are high by historical standards, spending growth in the coming years will be relatively modest. Overall day-to-day departmental spending is set to rise by an average of just 1.2% above inflation over the next three years. This will make the spending review tough. Allocating spending across departments will inevitably mean picking winners and losers.', 'The single most consequential decision will be how much funding to allocate to the NHS. The NHS budget is big – it accounts for 40% of day-to-day spending on public services. That’s comfortably more than is spent on schools, universities, the police, prisons and defence combined.', 'For decades, the savings from declining defence spending were effectively ploughed into the health service. Those “peace dividend” days are gone. The government has already committed to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income. It’s unusual for health and defence spending to grow at once – and unheard of for it to happen in a period of low growth and high interest rates. If the government also chooses to prioritise the NHS budget alongside defence, other departments’ budgets will see cuts.', 'Consider this scenario: if the government increases defence spending as promised, and opts for a 3.4% annual increase in NHS funding – below the long-term average and far short of the 6% growth seen under Labour in the 2000s – it would probably be enough to hire the staff the government’s workforce plan says the NHS needs and deliver improvements to NHS performance before the next election. But the wider implications would be stark: it would require cuts of 1% a year to the budget for all other departments.', 'The government could, of course, allocate less to the NHS. That could jeopardise the promise to substantially reduce hospital waiting times by the next election and to build an “NHS fit for the future”. But it would free up resources for its other missions to “break down the barriers to opportunity”, “make Britain a clean energy superpower”, deliver “safer streets” and “kickstart economic growth”. When funding is tight, more money for a shiny new initiative inevitably means less money for something else.', 'The prime minister noted that achieving the five missions of his government will demand “relentless focus and prioritisation”. We’ll soon find out, when push comes to shove, what this government’s priorities are.', 'Some departments, and some ministers, are likely to be disappointed. Once the spending review settlements are revealed, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, may not be the only Labour MP calling for higher taxes to reduce pressure on spending. By autumn, however, disgruntled colleagues could be the least of Reeves’s concerns.', 'At the spring statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was significantly more optimistic about growth prospects than most other forecasters. Since then, global developments have been bad news for the UK’s economic outlook.', 'If the OBR downgrades its growth forecast, that could easily wipe out the chancellor’s limited wiggle room against her fiscal rules – perhaps several times over. Last November, Reeves was adamant that she would not be “coming back with more borrowing or more taxes”. But unless she gets lucky, she will have to come back with something to avoid a breach of her rules for borrowing.', 'Assuming her fiscal rules remain “ironclad”, Reeves will have three options. She could cut departmental spending, just a few months after settling multiyear spending plans with her cabinet colleagues. She could make further cuts to the social security budget, when there is pressure – not least from some MPs – to do the exact opposite. Or she could raise taxes again to pay for the spending that has already been pledged. It’s clear why speculation about potential tax rises will continue.', 'But we should not let speculation about the budget distract us from scrutinising the spending review itself. The government’s decisions on how to allocate more than £600bn of spending a year for several years will be of great consequence, whatever happens in the autumn.', 'And, since speculation about the budget will inevitably continue, the discussion should shift from simply how taxes could be tweaked to raise more revenue to how they could be reformed to be less damaging to growth. Delivering higher growth deserves its place as the government’s number one mission and should be a central focus across all areas of policy. Reeves is yet to show any interest in tax reform. She is missing an opportunity. With challenging years ahead, we need a government that seizes every opportunity to drive up economic growth. Achieving that mission would make everything else easier.', 'Helen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhWVzVSV0RNelpsVllRMnQxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZFpvUUxNZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df
,https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/spending+review+2025+what+we+want+to+see+09062025162500?open,"[""In the coming days, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will unveil the UK's first multi-year Spending Review since 2021, and the first ‘zero-based’ review since 2007, marking a pivotal moment for the government as it sets departmental spending budgets through to 2029."", ""With public services under strain, a £22 billion budget gap, and limited fiscal headroom, Reeves faces the daunting task of balancing stability with reform, and fiscal responsibility with the need to invest over the long term for growth. Finding sufficient funds to fund the UK's planned military expansion, along with the budget required to meet each of the Government’s five missions, will come at the expense of other departmental budgets.  "", 'Despite the tough outlook, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are loathe to admit returning to anything resembling austerity, and both seek to develop better links with industry than their predecessors. Ahead of this crucial moment, techUK sets out its five key asks of the Government.  ', '1. Stability ', 'Like many business organisations, we want to see more certainty and stability built into the Government’s fiscal planning. Reeves approach to date has consistently left her with little-to-no room for manoeuvre, with just £9.9 billion in headroom at both the 2024 Autumn Budget and Spring Statement. This leaves the Chancellor’s fiscal planning at the whim of even a slight disruption – tariffs, anyone? - and means that intervention is required at every fiscal event to drag us back into the black.  ', 'Setting a larger amount fiscal headroom would make the Chancellor’s plans more resilient to global or domestic shocks and give businesses more confidence that they can plan effectively without having to worry about tax rises, tweaks, or other tinkering every six months. ', '2. Taxation ', 'In a techUK/Public First survey in February 2025, 42% of senior tech business leaders cited the high levels of business taxation as one of the largest barriers to growth, an increase of 12% on the year before.  ', 'While business understands the difficult environment the Government is operating within, we need our tax system to support growth, not hinder it. Without economic growth to raise profits, increase tax revenues, and spur new entrants to the market, the Government will find itself limited to taxing an ever-growing proportion of an ever-shrinking whole.  ', '3. Tech-enabled savings  ', 'The cuts we already know to be included in the review will have been a difficult pill for many departments and Ministers to swallow, who must now find significant savings across their estates. The tech sector has a key role to play in helping Government find these efficiency savings, whether that is through addressing outdated, expensive legacy IT or by implementing new AI tools and assistants to automate standard tasks, Government can use tech effectively to not only cut spending, but increase outcomes.  ', 'A Social Market Foundation study found that 8.12 million hours, equivalent to 4,300 working years, could be saved simply by streamlining caseloads at DWP and HMRC alone through the use of AI and automation procedures.  ', '4. Energy ', 'High energy prices remain a drain on consumers, businesses and public spending alike.

There are also claims a senior Home Office official stopped taking calls from the Treasury.', 'Sir Keir Starmer has had to directly intervene to end the stand-off over the spending review. Downing Street on Monday said Ms Cooper had agreed to accept the Treasury offer, which includes a real-terms increase in policing budgets.', 'Multiple well-placed government insiders told The Telegraph that the negotiations between Ms Cooper and the Treasury became so fraught that there was discussion about whether she would quit.', 'An ally of Ms Cooper on Monday evening denied that she might resign, noting she had been talking to aides about her diary engagements for the rest of the month earlier in the day.', 'But the fact that some figures in Downing Street and the Treasury have considered her departure a distinct possibility underscores how tense the talks became.', 'Labour promised in its 2024 general election manifesto to halve violence against women and girls, reduce knife crime and establish 13,000 more community police officers.', 'As Home Secretary, Ms Cooper is responsible for delivering those promises but it is the Treasury that decides how much money can go into policing.', 'Treasury insiders are framing the police as a winner in Wednesday’s spending review, which sets departmental spending for the next three years, as the policing budget will rise in real terms.', 'But the degree to which police chiefs have launched into a public lobbying campaign against the Treasury – one still running over the weekend – suggests they fear it will not be enough.', 'The Tories believe that, even with real-term police spending rises, it is likely that total officer headcount in England and Wales will fall from its peak of 149,000 in 2024 in the years ahead.', 'Ms Cooper was the last cabinet minister left standing when Angela Rayner, the Communities Secretary, who has also battled with the Treasury, settled her budget on Sunday evening. The Home Secretary finally agreed a deal with less than 48 hours to go until Ms Reeves announces her spending plans.', 'The settlement was reportedly imposed on her by the Chancellor.', 'One ally of Ms Cooper said of her tough negotiating approach: “Yvette’s been chief secretary of the Treasury.

UK tax rises in the autumn are essential – but who will pay?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/04/rachel-reeves-cant-avoid-raising-taxes-needs-creative-approach-spending-review,"['Next week’s spring statement is buying time, but the writing is on the wall: Britain is broken, and repairs cost money', 'S\nir Keir Starmer is pledging to make Britain “battle-ready” by spending billions of pounds on arms factories, drones and submarines. Rachel Reeves says she will invest £15bn in trams, buses and trains for towns and cities outside London. The announcements by the prime minister and chancellor followed last month’s partial U-turn on the means testing of pensioners’ winter fuel allowance. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking the tough times were over and that money was now no object.', 'Nothing could be further from the truth. The spending review Reeves will deliver next week comes at a time when growth is weak and borrowing high. The brutal reality is that if more is to be spent on defence and the NHS, if the police are to be handed extra resources to tackle crime, and if pledges to hit housebuilding and net zero targets are to be fulfilled, something has to give. And that something will be higher taxes in the budget. It is just a matter of which taxes and who pays them.', 'Reeves could simply borrow more money to fund increases in spending. That’s precisely what happened during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and during the pandemic. It is what would happen again in the event that the new cold war turned into a real shooting match. When things are really bad, governments abandon all thoughts of financial probity, spend whatever it takes and think about the consequences later.', 'Short of a full-blown crisis, there is no way Reeves is going to throw caution to the wind. Her room for manoeuvre is limited by her self-imposed fiscal rules – that over time national debt should be falling as a share of national income, and that day-to-day spending should be covered by tax receipts. The first of these affects the level of capital spending and was tweaked in last autumn’s budget to make possible the welcome increases in spending on transport infrastructure for less well-off parts of the country. Even so, the debt rule still means there are constraints on capital spending, and the more that is invested in military hardware, the less will be available for everything else.', 'In the short term, it is the second rule that makes life difficult for Reeves. Unsurprisingly, given the neglect of the public realm in the 14 years of Conservative rule, there are powerful arguments for higher day-to-day spending, but the chancellor has insisted these must be covered by tax receipts. This rule – “iron-clad” according to Reeves – is policed by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides outside scrutiny of the state of the public finances. If the OBR says the rule is going to be broken, Reeves can only avoid raising taxes if she is prepared to say it is not so “iron-clad” after all.', 'There is a case for doing this. The OBR is far from infallible and its assessment is based on judgment calls on what will happen to the economy over the coming years. Cutting spending or raising taxes on the basis of views that might change within a matter of months is not sensible policymaking. At the very least, there should be less frequent OBR assessments – a change recently recommended by the International Monetary Fund.', 'Britain currently has a system where the level of public spending is determined by what the Treasury and the OBR says the country can afford, rather than a system where it is determined by what the country actually needs. Those needs are many and will cost plenty to put right.', 'The prisons are full, the roads are potholed, the police say the fight against crime is being hampered by a lack of cash. There is no longer a peace dividend to fund higher welfare spending. Voters think the NHS needs extra resources, and after the furore over the winter fuel allowance, it will be a brave government that floats the idea of scrapping the triple lock guaranteeing that the state pension rises in line with either inflation, earnings or a minimum of 2.5%.', 'Rapid growth would help but seems unlikely. A complete rethink of borrowing rules is not being considered. As a result, unless the state is going to shrink in size, the government has to be prepared to raise taxes. That’s not a popular message, to say the least, especially when taxes are on course to reach the highest share of national income in more than 70 years.', 'This is understandable. The recent cost of living crisis eroded living standards and made the public hostile to the idea of paying more tax. Voters think higher spending is a good idea – but only if somebody else foots the bill. This would make it a political no-no to raise VAT rates and income tax, even if that were not already ruled out by Labour’s election manifesto commitment.', 'So Reeves needs to think creatively about ways to raise revenue. A fresh freeze on income tax allowances and thresholds is one possibility, although it would hit the pockets of working people, and almost certainly lead to a bigger opinion poll lead for Reform UK.', 'But there are other options. A tax on financial transactions is one. Limiting pension tax relief to the basic rate of income tax – as suggested by the tax expert Richard Murphy – is another. But no matter what Reeves chooses, she needs to start making the case now that you can’t get better public services on the cheap.', 'Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhWVzVSV0RNelpsVllRMnQxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZFpvUUxNZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df

Yet Wednesday’s (Jun 11) Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) will be one of the last big – diarised – events remaining, before the next general election in 2028 or 2029, for him to redefine the political terms of trade.', 'The review, while not technically a fiscal event with explicit tax-setting powers, will decide the public sector’s spending envelope for the rest of this parliament. So, it is a rare moment to try to define the political agenda for much of the rest of the 2020s.', 'A second reason why the occasion is so precious for the government is that ministers have had a challenging first 11 months in power. To be sure, they were buoyed by last Thursday’s Scottish parliament by-election which saw a surprise win for Labour in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse.', 'However, the bigger picture for the Starmer team is a series of continuing challenges that have cut short the political honeymoon that it might have expected to enjoy given the huge majority it won last July. So the government will be looking to Wednesday as a big reset moment to try to get on the front foot again.', 'The concept of CSRs – encouraging strategic, multi-year spending horizons in the public sector – was created during the last Labour governments of prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from 1997 to 2010. Yet, while these may be good ideas economically, they relatively rarely raise big political ripples globally.', 'However, Wednesday’s CSR could be different. Many international investors are looking closely at the details of what may be the most important such statement for a generation by a UK government.', 'Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.', 'The reason is that Starmer’s government is the first, since at least the 2010 to 2015 coalition led by then prime minister David Cameron, that may survive a full parliamentary term with relative stability, including no change of leader. Since 2015, UK governments have been comparatively weak with no less than six prime ministers in the form of Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and now Starmer.', 'Despite his challenging first year in office, it remains possible that Starmer could, in 2028 or 2029, become the first prime minister since Cameron in 2015 to win a second term. This would potentially allow him to deliver his pledged “decade of renewal” well into the 2030s.', 'Politically, the goal of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Wednesday will therefore be twofold. First, with the global economy reeling from policy uncertainty from US President Donald Trump, she will seek to depict the United Kingdom as a safe haven. In part, this is because of the City of London’s status as Europe’s key financial centre with the pound sterling still the world’s fourth-largest reserve currency after the dollar, the euro and the yen, amounting to around 5 per cent of global foreign exchange reserves.', 'SEE ALSO', 'Second, she will seek to set out a coherent, optimistic, forward-looking vision for the future of the country in the 2030s. While the public finances are still fragile, this will include a spending blueprint for what she proclaimed in her first Budget last October will be “a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy as momentous as any in Labour’s history”.', 'The intent is to draw comparison with the historic reform programmes begun in 1945 under then prime minister Clement Attlee which created the National Health Service (NHS), in 1964 under then premier Harold Wilson, and in 1997 under then prime minister Blair. By the end of the current term of parliament, no later than 2029, total government spending will have increased very substantially from when Labour took office in 2024.', 'The NHS and defence are set to be the big winners on Wednesday; so much so, that there is a joke of sorts in Westminster: that the UK government may soon comprise just “the NHS and the military, with the rest just bolted on”.', 'It is widely reported that the NHS will be handed around a 2.8 per cent annual increase in its day-to-day budget over at least a three-year period. This would amount to a cash increase of about £30 billion (S$52.3 billion) by 2028.', 'Meanwhile, the UK government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product, which will mean spending around £13.4 billion more every year from 2027. Starmer has also pledged, outside of Wednesday’s CSR, to reach a target of 3 per cent of GDP in the next parliament, which the independent UK Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated would cost an additional £17.3 billion in 2029-30.', 'From the standpoint of investors, there is growing speculation about what this will mean for economic growth, plus the growing possibility of further, significant tax increases of potentially tens of billions of pounds.', 'Already, the new tax measures announced by Reeves last October amounted to around £40 billion. This easily exceeded the tax take in the first Budgets of the last two key UK Labour governments – Brown’s in 1997 and George Osborne’s in 2010, even when those figures are translated into today’s prices to reflect inflation. Indeed, the 2024 Budget was the biggest tax-raising fiscal event in half a century alongside then chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont’s in 1993.', 'Beyond tax, UK economic growth is also key for investors. Since the international financial crisis around two decades ago, growth has flatlined compared to the era immediately before, and Starmer and Reeves have said their No 1 mission is to get out of this financial funk. Yet, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recently downgraded further its estimate for UK growth in 2025 to 1.3 per cent, from 1.4 per cent, and in 2026 to 1 per cent, from 1.2 per cent.', 'With growth remaining relatively flat, Reeves is likely to highlight the impact of falling interest rates with four cuts since last July, plus also policy changes including infrastructure development. It is reported, for instance, that Reeves will announce on Wednesday an additional £113 billion a year in infrastructure spending designed to help grow the economy, such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant and a new generation of mini reactors.', 'Taken together, the UK CSR is therefore shaping up to be a major milestone yet for Starmer’s government as it seeks to revamp itself after an uneven first year in power.

The UK’s underlying challenge isn’t new, it’s growth, or the lack thereof. However, James highlighted recent signs of economic momentum: -0.7% growth in Q1 2025, new trade deals, and more spending already announced. This offers the Government an opportunity to tell a more optimistic story, but hard choices still need to be taken.', 'Gideon Skinner, Senior Director of UK Politics at Ipsos, then  delivered fresh polling data that set out the political minefield ahead. Public sentiment is gloomy as 54% of Britons think we are currently in austerity, with expectations of tax rises going up but the positive quid pro quo of more spending on public services going down.', 'When it comes to public services specifically, the public puts the NHS in clear first place as a priority for more spending (63%), followed by border and immigration control (25%).

This is the Government’s dilemma.', 'Next, Ben Zaranko, Associate Director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), walked us through the maths and balancing act required of the Spending Review.

To boost living standards, especially for those left behind, it needs to consider redistributive investment not just universal health spending.', 'The Ipsos webinar made clear that the upcoming Spending Review is about far more than spreadsheets.

Yet more than two years on “the impact of the mini-budget still hovers over the gilt market”, according to Sanjay Raja, UK economist at Deutsche Bank.', 'Ordinarily a government spending review is not the kind of “fiscal event” that should concern bond investors. Reeves is unlikely to announce any changes to spending plans or tax policy on June 11 and instead unveil how the government will allocate the 1.3 per cent annual increase in day-to-day departmental spending and the more than 2 per cent rise in capital expenditure over the next three and four years respectively that have already been announced. But chancellors are often tempted into raising their spending ceilings, with an average 1.1 per cent rise in day to day spending announced at spending reviews, according to Capital Economics.', 'Bond markets will be watching closely for signs of any fiscal slippage amid a backdrop of rising government borrowing costs, a still-high interest rate environment, and a modest global economic recovery that has been derailed by President Trump’s tariffs.', 'The chancellor’s spending decisions will also have significant economic implications. In the medium term Reeves’s ability to hit her growth target will be shaped by where she chooses to pump the £113 billion in borrowing for investment that was freed up in her maiden budget. Labour will be spending close to £400 billion more than the Tories over the span of this parliament, just under 10 per cent of GDP, according to the Resolution Foundation.', 'In the run up to the spending review, Reeves has been warned by two big international forecasters that she is all but certain to break her fiscal rules unless further remedial action in the form of tax rises or spending cuts is taken later this year.', 'This week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the chancellor’s “wafer thin” fiscal headroom of £9.9 billion will vanish if growth undershoots forecasts or with another incremental jump in government bond yields.', 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also advised Reeves to stick with her fiscal framework but to resist the pressure from financial markets, economists and the media to maintain the headroom with rolling policy changes every few months. “There is still market pressure for more frequent policy changes outside the fiscal event,” Luc Eyraud, the IMF’s mission chief to the UK, said.', 'Bond investors will be watching Reeves’s spending review for any hints of potential tax rises to come in the autumn and have braced themselves for another summer of speculation about Labour’s revenue-raising options. “As the government inches towards breaking its fiscal rules, further tax hikes at the next budget later this year look all but inevitable,” Andrew Hunter, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, said.', 'Bond yields have also turned against the chancellor since her spring statement. The UK has not been the beneficiary of significant “haven” flows into gilts after Trump’s tariffs have hit US assets and the value of the dollar. Long-term UK gilt yields are still trading higher than their 30-year US counterparts and touched a fresh 27-year high last month. Foreign investors, whose confidence the UK needs to maintain to press down on borrowing costs, cut back their net holdings of UK debt by more than £9 billion in April, according to figures from the Bank of England.', 'Bond yields rise when prices fall and they have a direct bearing on the government’s tight fiscal arithmetic. The climb in market borrowing costs since March has whittled away another £5 billion from the chancellor’s £9.9 billion headroom, according to figures from Oxford Economics.', 'Analysts at Deutsche Bank think gilts are trading at too high a premium compared with other markets and the mini-budget marked a decisive shift in the attractiveness of UK debt. “Having previously traded ‘rich’, with yields lower than forecasted levels, for the best part of 15 years, the mini-budget and gilt market turbulence of autumn 2022 has been the trigger for an apparent regime change,” they said.', 'Gilt yields have been partly dragged higher by the US bond market and the UK’s restrictive monetary policy environment in which the Bank of England has been cutting interest rates at a far more incremental pace than assumed by markets at the start of the year. “The limited headroom is an obvious vulnerability for gilts but the nature of politics means it is unlikely to be increased in any impactful way,” analysts at Phoenix Group, the UK’s largest savings and retirement business, said.', 'The chancellor will hope that the restive bond markets barely react to her maiden spending review. She will celebrate good news on the economy — including a 0.7 per cent of GDP outperformance at the start of the year — and the government’s partial trade agreements with the US, India and the European Union in the past month.', 'She wants to cast off the notion that Labour is bringing back austerity and celebrate the government pumping £550 billion into capital spending over the next four years, £350 billion of it allocated for growth-boosting sectors such as research and development and defence.', 'With huge sums will come even more scrutiny. Economists do not expect defence spending to provide any significant growth boost to the economy in the short run and the growth dividend from investment plans will be likely to reveal itself over years and decades. The chancellor will hope that the promise of higher potential growth and sustainable public finances in the future will be enough to stave off the bond vigilantes.', 'Rachel Reeves has been urged to lift investment in Britain’s railways, social housing and energy infrastructure to boost economic growth at the spending review next week, in which she will allocate more than £100 billion of capital spending, writes Jack Barnett.', 'Think tanks said the chancellor has an opportunity to kick-start a revival in UK living standards and productivity by drastically stepping up public investment.', 'Adrian Pabst, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, appealed to Reeves to prioritise “greater transport connectivity within and across northern cities and towns, for example, a tram in Leeds, but also faster, more reliable lines linking Liverpool to Hull”.', 'Pranesh Narayanan, a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, also called for improvements to northern transport links and a substantial rise in spending on social housing. “Significant and consistent social housing investment would be a countercyclical measure that could boost the resilience of the UK construction industry,” he said.', 'James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The best way to achieve the government’s desperately needed growth boost is to invest in economic infrastructure, such as improvements to our energy grid, transport network and R&D [research and development] capacity.', '“But that’s not all it should do. Investing in our crumbling public services — equipping our hospitals and building more affordable housing — are high priorities for the public and will help progress the government’s other missions.”', 'Andrew Carter, chief executive of the Centre for Cities, said: “Many towns like Burnley and Huddersfield face deep-rooted economic challenges, including low land values and weaker demand for workspace. These places require targeted public investment to kick-start urban regeneration. Funding should support workspace-led developments and the repurposing or demolition of outdated buildings to make way for future economic activity.', '“Cities like Bristol, Cambridge and Milton Keynes already host lots of cutting-edge industries, but their future growth is constrained by a lack of housing and infrastructure. Government funding for new towns should prioritise locations facing severe housing shortages, especially in and around London and the greater southeast.”', 'Since the 2008 global financial crisis, UK productivity and real-wage growth have stalled, which has damaged other developed economies. Experts think this is partly due to weak investment, which slowed sharply following the 2016 Brexit referendum. The UK has ranked last among G7 countries for gross fixed capital formation for much of the past 30 years.', 'A study by the Office for Budget Responsibility last year found that a sustained 1 per cent of GDP increase in government investment would expand the UK economy’s productive capacity by 2.5 per cent after 50 years.', 'As part of the spending review on Wednesday, Reeves will flesh out details of where the more than £100 billion of capital spending — funded by extra borrowing enabled by a change to the public debt target — that was announced at the October budget will be allocated over the next four years. She will also set out daily departmental spending resources for three years.', 'This week, Reeves announced £15.6 billion of investment in regional transport infrastructure, including renewing the tram network in South Yorkshire and an expansion of the Newcastle-to-Sunderland Metro.', 'At the direction of Reeves in January, officials have reviewed the Treasury’s Green Book, which determines which investment projects get the green light. They are expected to recommend allocating more money to areas outside of London and the southeast that have lower productivity.', 'Although announcements in the spending review will not be determined by an erosion of the chancellor’s wafer-thin headroom of £9.9 billion, the government has been forced into a partial U-turn on the abolition of universal winter fuel payments.', 'Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that his government will abolish the two-child benefit cap at a cost of just over £2 billion, suggesting that the chancellor may have to deliver additional spending cuts or tax rises at the next budget in the autumn to restore the cushion against her main fiscal rule: paying for day-to-day spending with tax revenues.', 'A Treasury spokesman said: “We’re overhauling the planning system to build 1.5 million homes, investing in clean energy projects and this week we announced the biggest ever investment in city region local transport.', '“Next week’s Spending Review will go even further to deliver economic growth, driven by investment in all parts of the country.”', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.

"Winter fuel payments U-turn likely to lead to higher taxes or other welfare cuts, says IFS director – as it happened",https://www.inkl.com/news/minister-says-spending-review-will-mark-end-to-austerity-as-home-office-yet-to-agree-deal-uk-politics-live,"['6.10pm BST', 'All pensioners with an income of £35,000 or less a year will have the winter fuel payment restored in full, Rachel Reeves has announced, after weeks of uncertainty over the decision to make a U-turn on scrapping the benefit. The move was welcomed by all the main opposition parties in the Commons, although some said the government should have apologised for cutting the benefit in the first place last year. But, in a classic example of how political consensus at Westminster does not always overlap with what is seen by experts as wise policy making, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, told the PM programme that he did not think today’s announcement was a good one. He said he thought cutting the benefit last year was a “sensible” policy in the first place and that restoring the benefit for most pensioners in this manner was not a sound use of public money. He explained:', 'It wouldn’t even be in the top 100 of things that I would do with my £1.25bn if I wanted to act on poverty. Almost none of the people impacted by this will be in poverty. Most of them will be at least as well off as the average in the population.', 'We know that poverty is much worse among families with children than it is with pensioners, and of course the poorest pensioners are already getting this - they are covered through the pension credit system.', 'Johnson also said the net savings to the taxpayer would be “so small as to be barely visible.” But – crucially – he also admitted that the IFS does not have to stand for election.', 'Sadiq Khan is understood to be furious at the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over a lack of funding for London in the forthcoming spending review, with sources close to the mayor suggesting the capital will get none of its key transport requests.', 'Nigel Farage has demanded the reopening of domestic coalmines to provide fuel for new blast furnaces, arguing that Welsh people would happily return to mining if the pay was sufficiently high.', 'All civil servants in England and Wales will get practical training in how to use artificial intelligence to speed up their work from this autumn, the Guardian has learned.', 'For a full list of all the stories covered here today, scroll through the key events timeline at the top of the blog.', 'Updated at 6.22pm BST', '5.53pm BST', 'This is from Patrick Maguire from the Times on Nigel Farage’s speech today.', 'There was a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it flash of Blairism in Farage’s speech in Wales earlier: asking big employers to sponsor specialist vocational academies.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVhWVzVSV0RNelpsVllRMnQxVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhZFpvUUxNZ1k=-w280-h168-p-df

Rachel Reeves will try and paper over the cracks... but we're facing economic catastrophe,https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/2066505/rachel-reeves-ster-mcvey-catastrophe,"['OPINION', 'Laughably, Labour Minister Peter Kyle tried at the weekend to compare the hapless Rachel from Accounts with Apple legend Steve Jobs. I don’t know how he kept a straight face, when the accurate description would have been Rachel destroyer of jobs. Tomorrow Rachel Reeves will put on a brave face in the Commons to deliver her Spending Review.', 'She will no doubt try to paper over the cracks with new spending packages that the government can’t afford and some more ill-thought out spending cuts that won’t save money – like Labour’s barmy prison reforms of sending fewer people to jail, leaving more criminals on the streets, costing society more and pushing up the cost of policing.', 'The fact is, this government is presiding over an economic catastrophe. They’ve pushed taxes on jobs and businesses so high that employing people has become prohibitive, with the inevitable consequence that unemployment will rise and public finances will get worse.', 'There are only two feasible ways the government can make a genuine difference in terms of cutting spending. The first is to tackle the outrageous and growing cost of illegal immigration, and the second is to cut benefits. This is what Reeves should be focusing her review on. But does anyone really think that the former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer is ever going to do anything meaningful about immigration?', ""Don't miss...\nTory MP backs calls for change in law by family of murdered woman\nEsther McVey went to war on 'diversity' experts costing taxpayers millions\n'Keir Starmer's calamity-prone pal Lord Hermer must resign for good of UK'"", 'That leaves welfare reform as the only possible way for Reeves to get out of the mess she has got herself and the country into. By welfare reform, I don’t mean the ham-fisted £5billon grab she tried in her emergency spring statement from the disability budget. I mean the hard work of getting people into work and tightening benefit rules.', 'In fact, if working-age benefits were taken back to pre-pandemic levels, a time when I was running the Work & Pensions department, it would save the government a whopping £49billon, in real terms, by the end of the fiscal period. Evidence shows this government is heading in the wrong direction. Last year, claims for Universal Credit shot up by a million to 7.5million. That means 39,000 new people getting benefits every week. And incredibly, nearly a million young people are not in employment, training or education.', 'This would be my focus. But it would require Reeves to reverse her harmful employer NIC hikes which are doing so much to destroy jobs – vacancies fell by 143,00 last year and starter jobs for the young fell at the fastest rate of all. Reeves, however, has no intention of doing that to ease unemployment. Instead, she is eyeing up even more tax hikes – refusing to rule out tax rises four times at the annual CBI dinner last week.', ""We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They don’t see that if they keep taxing businesses there won’t be any jobs for people to go into. What we will see is employment going down and the benefits bill going up, and if Labour do abolish the two children benefits cap the benefits bill will rocket. Getting people off benefits and into work is the only way to grow the economy and get this country out of its financial hole. Sadly they never learn.', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'Last week’s PMQs was Kemi Badenoch’s best performance yet, and she definitely delivered her best line to date, observing that when she asked the Prime Minister what he believed in, he had to look in his pre-prepared red file to find the answer.', 'It perfectly summed up Starmer – a Prime Minister who believes in absolutely nothing and has to be told by his aides what his views are. I hope Kemi keeps up these truth bombs as they will resonate with the public who also see that Starmer is a dead loss and out of his depth.', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'Just when you thought you’d seen the back of the high priestess of Net Zero, Greta Thunberg, the grinning pixie is back with a new global cause.

Please can we be spared any more of this attention seeker?', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'It’s outrageous that upmarket restaurant Hawksmoor kicked out Tommy Robinson and his friends from their restaurant because their staff didn’t want to serve them.', 'Everyone agrees that they were being well-behaved, and so there was no justification for his ejection. It doesn’t matter whether you or I approve of Robinson, his views or his actions. We simply cannot have a situation where businesses refuse to serve you because they don’t approve of your opinions.', 'Where does that end? And if it’s allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, we could all find ourselves on the wrong end of that kind of attitude. In a free country we can’t allow the thought police to decide who can and cannot be served. I hope people vote with their feet and do to Hawksmoor what they did to Robinson, and avoid them like the plague.', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'Transparency is a wonderful thing. One of the most beautiful women in the world, Kylie Jenner, has just come clean: admitting that she isn’t all natural and blessed with the best DNA, but has a surgeon and enhancements. I suppose there is no point being a billionaire if you can’t buy yourself the perfect body!', '+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++', 'Who on earth would think there was justification to refuse a child NHS treatment because they attended a private school, as has been reported recently in London? Apparently, that is the depths to which two-tier Britain has sunk.', 'The Department of Health is now saying it’s all been a matter of “miscommunication”. Here’s the alleged communication, so decide for yourselves, as it seems pretty clear cut to me: “We are unable to see this child as we do not provide a service to school-age children who attend an independent schools [sic]. We are only commissioned to provide a service to the mainstream schools.” Once again this Labour government is fuelling jealousy and division, a process which started with its attack on private schools and the imposition of VAT on their fees.
