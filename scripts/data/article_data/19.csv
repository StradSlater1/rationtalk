DutchNews.nl - DutchNews.nl brings daily news from The Netherlands in English,https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/06/eu-countries-push-for-changes-to-air-passengers-compensation/,"['EU transport ministers pushed for several changes to EU rules on air passengers’ rights at their meeting on Thursday in Luxembourg, a decision that has been 12 years in the making and that still requires the agreement of the European parliament. The Netherlands was among the countries backing the new deal.', 'But consumer groups and some MPs argue the changes will remove the right to compensation for some passengers and airlines say the plans make the compensation regulations even more complex.', 'A key change concerns the thresholds for compensation in case of flight delays. EU governments agreed that compensation of €300 should be due for delays of over four hours for journeys under 3,500 km and journeys within the EU, and of €500 for delays of over six hours for journeys over 3,500 km.', 'Currently, airlines must pay compensation for delays of over three hours for short flights and four hours for long flights, with amounts ranging between €250 and €600 depending on the distance.', '“Although the deal improves some rights on paper, giving consumers improved access to information in case of disruption, care and assistance, it represents a substantial rollback of other key rights,” said Agustín Reyna, director general of European consumer association BEUC, which counts Consumentenbond among its members.', '“The new eligibility thresholds will deprive the majority of passengers from their compensation rights as most delays are between two and four hours,” he said.', 'Airlines can currently deny compensation in case of “extraordinary circumstances” beyond their control, such as the weather, but in the future will have to prove they took “all reasonable steps” to prevent disruptions, according to the EU Council position.', 'The new rules also give compensation to passengers who are informed of the cancellation of their flight less than 14 days before departure. They will also be able to arrange their own rerouting and claim reimbursement of up to 400% of the original ticket price. Passengers should also be reimbursed for refreshments, food and accommodation if the airlines do not provide them in case of delays.', 'The rules also require air companies to provide pre-filled compensation forms and tight deadlines to respond to claims. Passengers would have up to six months from the disrupting event to submit a request or a complaint and the airline will have to reply or compensate within 14 days.', 'To “disincentivise” no-show clauses, passengers who are denied boarding on a return flight because they did not take the outbound flight, would also be entitled to compensation.', 'Dariusz Klimczak, minister of infrastructure of Poland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, said “the revised rules will bring over 30 new rights to the air passengers, applicable from the moment when they buy a ticket, until they arrive at their destination, and in some cases even beyond”.', 'But Dutch MEP Mohammed Chahim, deputy president of the Socialists & Democrats group, said that people are not asking air companies for a favour.', '“They pay good money for the services and when these services are not delivered people deserve proper treatment and reasonable compensation,” he said in a statement.', '“The new rules will mean that passengers have less rights, because the conditions for compensation have been made more stringent. It leaves travellers with less certainty, and gives more leniency to airlines – which is a totally wrong set of priorities.”', 'Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of A4E (Airlines for Europe), the organisation representing the industry in Brussels, complained that “rather than providing delay thresholds of five and nine hours that would save up to 70% of rescuable cancelled flights, member states have … introduced even more complexity.”', 'We could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.

Passengers must be able to take one piece of luggage, a small suitcase or a rucksack,"" he added.', 'European airlines have a different interpretation of the case law. Kevin Hiney, Communications Director of A4E (Airlines for Europe), pointed out that ""under European law and the single market, airlines have the right to unbundle their services in order to offer the best possible package to passengers"".', 'For the organisation, which represents 17 airlines in Europe and 80% of European air traffic, the proposal on the table merely seeks to harmonise different approaches between companies on this cabin baggage.', '""I think it\'s important to stress that what the current proposal from the Poles (the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU) is doing is setting the dimensions of these personal items to ensure clarity and transparency for all passengers, as well as for the airlines,"" said Kevin Hiney.', 'In this political battle, consumers should be able to count on Spain to make their voice heard. Last November, Madrid condemned five airlines for abusive practices. The €179 million fine concerns, among other things, these extra charges on hand luggage.', 'A proposal to revise the 2004 European regulations on compensation for delays also set to be discussed by ambassadors on Wednesday is also causing concern among civil society, carriers and governments. Passenger groups and airlines both want to see the rules revised, but in different ways.', 'A European Commission proposal presented in 2013 envisaged extending the time limit required to trigger compensation to 5 hours of delay. The text presented to the member states by the Polish Presidency now moves in this same direction, proposing to extend the time limit for claiming primary compensation to 4 hours, with a second step from 6 hours depending on the distance of the journey.', 'At present, compensation of between  €250 and €600 euros can be claimed for delays of 3 hours or more. The European directive applies to all flights departing from an EU airport, regardless of the nationality of the airline, and to flights arriving at EU airports if they are operated by an EU airline. It does not apply to flights to Europe operated by non-EU airlines, or to non-EU flights with a stopover in Europe.', 'For A4E, the proposal is a step in the right direction. ""We believe that the compensation thresholds should be extended to allow us to have a chance of recovering flight schedules when things go wrong,"" explains Kevin Hiney.', '""In the event of a mechanical problem, airlines have to find a replacement aircraft or crew, which takes time,"" he pointed out. ""By adjusting the thresholds for compensation for delays, we will have a fighting chance to make these changes, to put in place the new aircraft and crew,"" said Kevin Hiney.', 'According to BEUC, the proposed reform would deprive a very large number of passengers of compensation. ""If the text is voted on as it stands between the member states, before negotiations with the Parliament, we will be sending out a very bad signal to European consumers by going back on rights that are really fundamental when travelling,"" says Steven Berger.', 'However, the outcome of the negotiations is uncertain. ""At the moment, there are two different opposing positions among the member states in the Council. On the whole, you have the camp of the member states that are going to defend the three hours to be able to benefit from the right to compensation and others that are going to ask for five hours and nine hours based on distance. So right now this is really the big source of conflict,"" said Steven Berger.', ""Just ten or so countries would constitute a blocking minority within the EU Council. Before the ambassadors' meeting, Germany and Spain seemed to be opposed to any change in the compensation rules. However, it is the entire revision that must be validated or rejected. In other words, opposing changes to the compensation rules will bring down the whole reform."", 'Devamını oku : www.euronews.com', '', '', '', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVlRbVphUlU5TVNqaG1jVmhPVFJEY0FSajNBaWdLTWdZQmdwYkpOUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

European airlines like Lufthansa, Air France, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways, Iberia, Swiss International Air Lines, Austrian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Wizz Air, Vueling, Finnair, Eurowings are watching closely. The stakes? Nothing less than customer loyalty, brand trust, and the overall passenger experience. Every word in the new rules could trigger massive shifts in how airlines operate and how travelers react. Will passengers still feel protected? Or will this move test their trust? As the EU debates these crucial rules, European airlines brace for impact. Meanwhile, tension builds across terminals and boardrooms alike. Will this signal the start of a fairer system or open a floodgate of dissatisfaction? The story unfolding isn’t just about policy—it’s about the emotional connection between travelers and their chosen airlines. And right now, that bond hangs in the balance.', '“This week, transport ministers from across the EU will meet to debate the question of air passenger compensation rights.', 'Advertisement', '“Whatever decision is taken, airlines should remember that compensation is about much more than just compliance with regulation. It’s also about passenger experience and brand building. Lower compensation values might appear to make good economic sense – and Swiipr supports any decision the EU makes that ensures the sustainability of the aviation sector – but changes must not come at the price of leaving passengers out of pocket and dissatisfied. That will only lower customer satisfaction and loyalty. ', '“We know its six to seven times more expensive to acquire a new customer than keep a current one. We also know that nearly half (46%) of travellers will consider giving up on an airline after just one bad experience. With tens of millions of travellers affected by disruptions each year, airlines risk sacrificing a huge volume of revenue from lost customer loyalty. Not to mention the reputational impact of review websites and social media.', '“A compassionate, customer-focused approach to compensation gives airlines the chance to rewrite the narrative around travel disruptions, turning a negative experience into a positive one. Even if regulations change, travel brands should continue to show customers they care by proactively providing customers with compensation to support them when they need it most.” – Tara Spielhagen, co-founder and CEO at Swiipr, a payment platform digitally transforming airline disruption payments', 'A critical decision is unfolding in European aviation-Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Ryanair, EasyJet, British Airways, Iberia, Swiss International Air Lines, Austrian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Wizz Air, Vueling, Finnair, Eurowings. This week, transport ministers from across the EU are meeting to review and potentially revise the bloc’s air passenger compensation regulations—a move that could reshape how airlines handle flight delays, cancellations, and disruptions for millions each year.', 'However, the implications go far beyond policy. For airlines, what’s at stake is not just compliance. It’s customer loyalty. Brand equity. And the long-term sustainability of a competitive industry already under immense pressure.', 'Airline Compensation Rules: What’s Changing and Why It Matters', 'Current EU regulations grant passengers the right to compensation in cases of delays, cancellations, or denied boarding. These payouts range from €250 to €600 depending on the flight length and delay duration.', 'But proposals now on the table could lower compensation thresholds or redefine eligibility. Airlines argue that rising operational costs and unpredictable disruptions—especially in the post-pandemic era—make these payouts unsustainable.', 'While economic logic supports this view, consumer protection advocates warn that any rollbacks could erode trust and customer satisfaction in an already fragile industry.', 'Why Passenger Experience Can’t Be an Afterthought', 'It’s tempting for airlines to prioritize short-term cost savings. But doing so risks long-term consequences.', 'Studies show it’s six to seven times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. Moreover, 46% of travelers say one bad experience is enough to drive them away from an airline permanently.', 'That’s nearly half the customer base—gone in a single disruption. With tens of millions of passengers affected by delays each year, the potential loss is staggering.', 'Reputation matters. One unresolved complaint can ripple across social media, review sites, and peer-to-peer platforms, damaging perception at a scale advertising dollars can’t repair.', 'Turning Disruption into Opportunity: A New Brand Narrative', 'Travel disruptions are inevitable. But how airlines respond isn’t.', 'A customer-focused approach to compensation can transform a negative experience into a brand-building moment. It signals accountability, empathy, and care—values that today’s travelers deeply prioritize.', 'Leading travel brands are already shifting their focus from reactive damage control to proactive solutions. Pre-loaded digital compensation cards, real-time support messages, and automated rebooking platforms show passengers they matter—even when things go wrong.', 'And that, in turn, drives loyalty, repeat bookings, and powerful word-of-mouth growth.', 'The Economics of Empathy in Aviation', 'The numbers don’t lie. While reduced compensation might save costs upfront, the lifetime value of a retained passenger far outweighs one-off savings.', 'Consider this: a frequent flier spends thousands annually. Multiply that by the years of potential loyalty lost from one poor experience, and the financial equation changes fast.', 'Airlines that invest in compassionate, user-first solutions are seeing stronger customer retention, lower churn rates, and improved Net Promoter Scores. In contrast, those that neglect passenger sentiment often face costly PR crises, class-action suits, or regulatory backlash.', 'Technology as a Game-Changer in Disruption Management', 'Digital innovation offers airlines the tools to bridge the gap between operational complexity and customer care.', 'Smart compensation platforms, like those offered by emerging travel tech providers, enable instant reimbursements, meal vouchers, and transport alternatives. Automation reduces human error. Personalization increases satisfaction.', 'These systems also offer data insights—helping airlines understand traveler pain points, spot disruption trends, and enhance resilience planning.', 'In today’s world, technology is no longer a support tool—it’s the cornerstone of modern passenger experience.', 'The Role of Regulation: Balancing Business and Consumer Protection', 'The EU’s debate represents a critical balancing act. Authorities must consider industry sustainability alongside consumer rights. And they must do so amid rising pressure from labor shortages, fuel price volatility, and climate-driven disruptions.', 'However, regulation is only part of the picture. Even if rules change, the smartest airlines will treat compensation not as a regulatory checkbox, but as a brand promise.', 'Doing just enough is no longer enough. Going beyond the minimum is what earns loyalty in a hyper-competitive travel landscape.', 'Travel Disruption Is Inevitable. Losing Trust Doesn’t Have to Be', 'As travelers gear up for one of the busiest summer seasons in recent history, delays, cancellations, and congestion will test the limits of airline systems worldwide.', 'This is not the time to scale back support. It’s the moment to step up.', 'Airlines that respond with transparency, empathy, and immediacy will not just survive—they will lead. They will set the new standard for how disruptions are managed in a world that increasingly values care over convenience.', 'Because at the heart of every flight is not just a seat number—it’s a human story.', 'Airlines Must Choose: Minimize Payouts or Maximize Trust', 'As the EU prepares to announce its next move, airlines face a defining choice. Will they reduce compensation and risk alienating passengers? Or will they reframe disruption as a loyalty opportunity?', 'The answer will shape the next decade of aviation brand-building.', 'Customer-first airlines will win hearts, fill seats, and build lasting relationships. The rest will struggle to retain trust in a market where travelers now expect more, not less.', 'Final Boarding Call for Customer Loyalty', 'The skies may be unpredictable, but what happens on the ground is fully within an airline’s control.
