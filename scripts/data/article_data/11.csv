The bombardment came just days after Ukraine launched a wide-scale, successful attack on long-range military aviation assets from within Russia. You can read more about that in our coverage here.', 'Ukraine launched ‚Äúa preemptive strike‚Äù on several Russian military targets ahead of a looming Russian attack, the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff claimed on Facebook. ‚ÄúOn the eve of the massive enemy shelling, enemy airfields and other important military facilities were hit.‚Äù Russia said its barrage was retaliation for the destruction of its bombers.', 'A ‚Äúsuccessful strike was carried out on the Engels airfield in the Saratov region ‚Äì a place of concentration of enemy aircraft remaining after the operation of the Security Service of Ukraine,‚Äù the General Staff added. ‚ÄúThe Diaghilev airfield in the Ryazan region, where air tankers and escort fighters are based, which are used to provide missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, was also hit.‚Äù', '', 'In addition, ‚Äúthe Defense Forces of Ukraine attacked a number of important enemy facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine. In particular, the defeat of the logistics point of the 30th motorized rifle regiment of the 72nd motorized rifle division of the Russian Army near the settlement of Kulbaky, Kursk region, was recorded. The results of the defeat are being clarified. Strikes on military infrastructure will continue until the complete cessation of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.‚Äù', 'The Russian Defense Ministry (MoD) downplayed the attacks, saying its ‚Äúalerted air defense systems intercepted and destroyed 174 Ukrainian fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles over Bryansk, Rostov, Saratov, Voronezh, Kaluga, Kursk, Oryol, Ryazan, Tula, Belgorod, Tambov, and Moscow regions, and the Republic of Crimea.‚Äù', 'The MoD also claimed that ‚Äúthree Ukrainian Neptune-MD guided missiles were also destroyed over the Black Sea by air defense systems.‚Äù', 'The War Zone cannot independently verify these claims.', 'Videos and images emerged on social media showing the fuel depot at Engels, about 400 miles from the border, being struck and fully engulfed in flames.', '', '', '', 'The attack on Dyagilevo, about 300 miles from the border, was also captured on video.', '', 'The extent of the destruction at either facility is as yet unclear, though clearly the raging fires at Engels have caused significant damage.

The former was attacked on June 1 during Ukraine‚Äôs audacious Operation Spiderweb that saw several Russian bombers and other aircraft destroyed or damaged by drones launched from trucks by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). While a high-resolution satellite image of Dyagilevo from Planet Labs, taken on June 2 and reviewed by TWZ, showed no obvious signs of damage to any aircraft there, some may have been hit by shrapnel, against which relatively thin-skinned aircraft are notably vulnerable, and this would not necessarily be visible even in higher-resolution imagery. You can see one image taken in the aftermath of Operation Spider Web below.', '', 'Engels was attacked three times in the month of December 2022 alone. On at least one of those occasions, the Russian Ministry of Defense said the air base was attacked by Soviet-made jet-powered unmanned aerial vehicles modified by Ukraine to carry explosives.

The attack resulted in a massive fireball and mushroom cloud. You can read our initial story about it here. In January of this year, we reported on a huge fire close to Engels Air Base, caused by what Russian officials described as a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù Ukrainian drone attack.

At least five people were injured in an attack using 15 drones and six missiles, according to Mayor Ihor Polishchuk.', '', 'The Ukrainian Track and Field Team came under fire in Lutsk.', '', 'Ternopil‚Äôs military chief Vyacheslav Negoda said Friday‚Äôs strike was the ‚Äúmost massive air attack on our region to date,‚Äù BBC reported.', 'The Mayor of Ternopil, Igor Polishchuk, said five people were wounded in the attack while homes, schools and a government facility had been damaged.', '', 'The city of Chernihiv was hit by Russian Geran-2 drones as well as cruise and ballistic missiles, according to Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, spokesman for the Kherson Regional Military Administration of Ukraine.', '‚ÄúA residential area came under fire: multi-story buildings, private homes, a kindergarten, a local business, infrastructure facilities, and civilians‚Äô vehicles were damaged,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDue to the strikes on the energy infrastructure, around 40.000 consumers remain without electricity. As of now, four civilians have been reported injured. Three of them received assistance on site, while another man was hospitalized in moderate condition.‚Äù', 'Though Russia lost several Tu-95s during Operation Spiderweb, it still managed to use some in this latest onslaught. Russia fired 36 Kh-101 cruise missiles from Bears and Tu-160 Blackjack long-range supersonic bombers from the airspace of the Saratov region, over the Caspian Sea, according to the Ukrainian Air Force (UaAF). In addition, the UaAF said six Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles were launched from Kursk and Voronezh regions, one Kh-31P anti-radar missile was fired from a tactical aircraft over the Black Sea and two Iskander-K cruise missiles were launched from the Dzhankoy district of Crimea.', 'The extent of Russia‚Äôs response to Operation Spiderweb is still unknown, however, these attacks show that both sides seem to be locked into an escalation of cross-border bombardment.', 'Contact the author: howard@thewarzone.com', ""Ukraine's intelligence chief says Moscow is giving Pyongyang advanced military technologies that could shift the balance of power on the peninsula."", 'Upgrades to the Modular Protective System-Overhead Cover could offer important lower-cost layers of defense against drones at bases anywhere.', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'JOSEPH TREVITHICK', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'HOWARD ALTMAN, TYLER ROGOWAY', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'HOWARD ALTMAN', 'THOMAS NEWDICK', 'Weekly insights and analysis on the latest developments in military technology, strategy, and foreign policy.', 'By Signing Up You Agree To Our Terms Of Service And Privacy Policy.', '¬© 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
