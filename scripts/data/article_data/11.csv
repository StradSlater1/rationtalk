The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.', 'Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.', ""The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018.

Sierra Leone might stay involved through multiple playoff games.

The exceptions should apply to them as well if the ban is still in place in its current form.', 'What about fans?', 'The travel ban doesn’t mention any exceptions for fans from the targeted countries wishing to travel to the U.S. for the World Cup or Olympics.', 'Even before the travel ban, fans of the Iran soccer team living in that country already had issues about getting a visa for a World Cup visit.', 'Still, national team supporters often profile differently to fans of club teams who go abroad for games in international competitions like the UEFA Champions League.', 'For many countries, fans traveling to the World Cup — an expensive travel plan with hiked flight and hotel prices — are often from the diaspora, wealthier, and could have different passport options.', 'A World Cup visitor is broadly higher-spending and lower-risk for host nation security planning.', 'Visitors to an Olympics are often even higher-end clients, though tourism for a Summer Games is significantly less than at a World Cup, with fewer still from most of the 19 countries now targeted.', 'How is the U.S. working with FIFA, Olympic officials?', 'FIFA President Gianni Infantino has publicly built close ties since 2018 to Trump — too close according to some.

But ""it\'s still a headache"" for many in Michigan, he said.', ""Trump's ban, announced late Wednesday, June 4, prohibits people from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially restricts and limits the entry of people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela."", 'Yemeni Americans — who are the largest Middle Eastern group in Detroit, Melvindale, Coldwater and Hamtramck, census data shows — already face challenges because of the war in Yemen that led to the shut down of all U.S. embassies and consulates. Trump\'s travel ban ""will only add to this misery,"" Alsadah said.', ""Metro Detroit, which has the highest percentage of Arab Americans among regions in the U.S., became an epicenter for challenges to Trump's first travel ban, often referred to as the Muslim travel ban since most of the nations were Muslim-majority nations. Nabih Ayad, a Detroit attorney, filed a federal lawsuit in Detroit in January 2017, shortly after Trump's first ban, on behalf of Muslims unable to travel to the U.S. to be with family members. There were several rallies held by Muslims and progressive groups in Michigan, including one at Detroit Metro Airport in Romulus. A federal court ruled in their favor the following month and they got a federal injunction blocking the ban, which was later rescinded by then President Joe Biden in January 2021 shortly after he took office."", '""I think its sends the wrong message, that America is not open to democracy and freedom,"" Ayad, the founder and board chairman of the Dearborn-based Arab American Civil Rights League, said of Trump\'s latest travel ban. It also violates the constitution and will impact families in metro Detroit, he said.', 'In making his announcement of the travel ban, Trump started his remarks by talking about the firebomb attack in Boulder on June 1 that injured fifteen people taking part in a rally for Israeli hostages. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an immigrant from Egypt who overstayed his visa; he was charged June 5 with 118 criminal counts.', '""The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,"" Trump said from the White House. ""We don\'t want them. In the 21st century, we\'ve seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places all over the world. ... In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil. We will not let what happened in Europe happen to America.""', ""But critics said Trump's reasoning has more to do with which countries the U.S. favors in its foreign policy rather than protecting Americans. Ayad noted that the man who carried out the June 1 attack in Boulder was from Egypt, which is not included in the travel ban."", '""It has nothing to do with national security,"" Ayad said.', 'U.S. Rep.

""These policies are rooted in white nationalism and will only increase hate, xenophobia, and Islamophobia in our country.""', 'Tlaib described Trump as “the white-supremacist-in-chief"" who ""has once again issued an unconstitutional travel ban"" around the time that Muslims are celebrating a major holiday on Friday, June 6.', '""This comes as Muslims in our communities and around the world prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha,"" the Detroit Congresswoman said. ""It is a shameful expansion of his hateful Muslim and African ban from his first term.""', 'U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, who used to live in Dearborn, also released a statement, saying ""Trump’s renewed travel ban will not make us safer, it will create more division. It\'s based on bigotry and xenophobia, just like the last one. U.S. policy should not be guided by hatred. This travel ban should not stand, and we must fight against it.""', 'Under Trump\'s latest travel ban, there are exceptions to the restrictions. People who are still allowed from the 19 nations include: permanent residents of the U.S. known as green card holders, some immediate family members of U.S. citizens, ""ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran,"" Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war with the Taliban, and athletes participating in the ""World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State,"" the order reads.', 'The latest order is more detailed in its rules, which is helpful, but the problem in many cases is implementation, advocates said. Individual officials may not understand the details of the ban and apply a broad brush.', 'Some officials ""are not well trained, especially overseas at embassies in specific countries,"" Alsadah said. ""So it\'s going to be hard for everybody.""', 'Christine Sauvé, the head of community engagement and communication for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, agreed with Tlaib that the ban is discriminatory.', '""The ban again targets Black, brown, and Muslim people who have recently fled places experiencing insecurity and strife,"" she said.

Welcome."", '', 'STEPHEN VLADECK: Thanks for having me.', '', ""KELLY: Your initial reaction to this new proclamation - I'm curious if there's anything in particular that sticks out."", '', ""VLADECK: Yeah. I mean, I think what's really striking about the latest iteration of this kind of travel ban is really how radically different it looks from the clumsier, I think, less careful attempts we saw during the first Trump administration. You know, the government in 2017, 2018, really had to try three different versions before they found one that the Supreme Court would uphold. It really does seem like this version is based on some of the lessons learned from that. It doesn't single out Muslim-majority countries. It tries to at least offer some kind of factual basis for why these countries and not others. You know, I think there will still be plenty of litigation challenging this, but it's not at least as obviously and facially vulnerable to litigation as we saw back in 2017."", '', ""KELLY: Right. I'm thinking of the original travel ban, which everyone referred to as the so-called Muslim ban. And that's something that looks quite different this time, in terms of the countries that are included. I will note that in the video that he dropped last night announcing this, he cited the attack this past Sunday in Boulder, saying that that attack underscored the dangers posed to the U.S. by foreign nationals. The man charged with that attack is from Egypt, which is not among the countries listed in this new."", '', ""VLADECK: Yeah. I mean, as is always the case with President Trump, there is a fair amount of daylight between what he says publicly and the actual policies to which he affixes his signature. But, you know, I think the problem here for those who think that's a legal defect and not just an optical one is, you know, the U.S. Supreme Court, back in 2018, when it upheld the third iteration of the first Trump administration's travel ban, really did say that the president's actual motive is not that relevant to whether the underlying policy is lawful, that the president's entitled to fairly broad deference when it comes to these kinds of immigration decisions about who's allowed to enter the United States in the first place."", '', ""And I think that's why it's important, although perhaps not ultimately sufficient, that this new travel ban carves out folks who have green cards, carves out folks who already have, you know, approved visas of various sorts. Because those were some of the real stumbling blocks last time around that really led the courts to - you know, to stop the policy before it could get off the ground. I think this time around, the litigation is probably going to focus far more specifically on the particular factual grounds that the government has come up with for why, for example, you know, Laos is on the list but Egypt is not, whether the - sort of the visa overstay data that the president purported to rely upon in his proclamation is actually both accurate and a legitimate basis. You know, I think that, Mary Louise, is where we're going to see a lot of the action."", '', ""KELLY: So we're talking around this a little bit, but I'll just ask directly the central question about how strong the legal underpinning for this latest ban is. In your view, will it stand up in court?"", '', ""VLADECK: So I think the distinction that we should draw here is, I do think on its face this version is stronger than certainly the first two rounds we saw in the First Trump administration. It's probably on par with the third one, which is the one that the Supreme Court, back in 2018, upheld. This Supreme Court that we have in 2025 is not going to be any more skeptical of this kind of policy than the one we had, you know, seven years ago. But, Mary Louise, as is so often the case, a lot of the devil will be in the details. And, you know, I would not put it past this administration to implement this policy in a, you know, ham-handed, clumsy, if not even affirmatively malicious way that opens it up to other kinds of - you know, what the lawyers would call as applied legal challenges."", '', ""KELLY: So you're saying that there is what is actually written in the ban - the words - and then there's how it is enforced, how it is applied."", '', ""VLADECK: That's exactly the distinction. And so it's - you know, my own view is that I think the words of this policy are probably going to do relatively well in court, but, you know, I would not put it past this administration to enforce it in a way that invites further lawsuits."", '', 'KELLY: Last thing - when you say we should expect legal challenges, from what corner? Where will you be keeping an eye on?', '', ""VLADECK: So I think we're going to see, you know, efforts from folks maybe who are already in the United States, but whose continuing ability to stay here is called into question by the travel ban, perhaps try to bring a lawsuit. Maybe folks who have a particular type of visa that's not one of the visa categories that is exempted from the travel ban. Maybe from, you know, refugee groups or other, you know, human-rights-driven, immigration-focused groups for whom - you know, this is a real problem for folks who might not yet have a visa but might have very strong legal arguments for why they should be allowed to come to the United States. You know, that's really where we saw the plaintiffs emerge back in the first Trump administration, in the challenges to the first, second and third travel bans. You know, if we're going to call this the fourth Trump travel ban, I suspect we're going to see similar plaintiffs, perhaps, you know, from different countries this time around."", '', 'KELLY: Stephen Vladeck is a law professor at Georgetown University.

Meanwhile, the news also elicited confusion over what will happen once the ban goes into effect on Monday.', '""This travel ban is a racist, bigoted and xenophobic and deeply un-American attack on human rights — it’s like persecution. We have fled dictatorship, violence, hunger,” Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told NBC News from Miami, a city with a large population of immigrants from several of the countries on Trump’s list.', '“This administration clearly has something against immigrants, and it has something against us in particular,” said José Antonio Colina, a former Venezuelan army lieutenant who fled to Miami in 2003 and heads the exile organization Veppex. “We are double-persecuted. We are persecuted by the tyranny of Nicolás Maduro and we are persecuted by the administration of Donald Trump.”', ""A 38-year-old Haitian green-card holder in Miami who was too fearful to allow her name to be used said she and many others in the community feel “confused and scared” over the travel ban on Haiti. She said most of her family lives there, including her sister and father, who is sick. “They come all the time to visit and now I don’t know if they will be able to,” she said, adding she heard there were exceptions to the ban but wasn't sure."", 'There are some exceptions, including for people with lawful permanent residency, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, those who are adopted and others.', '“But if you are a spouse of a permanent resident, forget about it,” said Doug Rand, former senior adviser of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration. It will also affect other relatives, such as adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens, people who won the diversity lottery or people who were sponsored by U.S. employers and are from the listed countries, “people who have been waiting for years and done it the right way,” he said.', 'In Havana, a queue of people outside the U.S. Embassy learned the news of the travel ban and suspensions as they waited for their visa interviews.', '“I had been waiting nine years for this moment,” said one young woman in line, who declined to be identified by name for fear it might affect her visa chances. She and others said the suspension means not being able to visit family or escape dire circumstances in Cuba.', '“If they don’t grant visas, Cubans will starve, given the situation, they will starve,” said Ismael Gainza, a retired Cuban. “I see that measure as bad, I see it as bad because the situation is tough and we have to survive.”', 'Trump’s proclamation issued Wednesday night bans nationals from 12 countries from traveling to the U.S. The countries are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.', 'In seven more countries, travel to the U.S. was suspended but not banned. They are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', ""Shahzeen Karim, managing attorney at Hafey & Karim law firm, said that although she's in the immigration law space, she holds “Republican views” on the topic, agreeing there's a need for a stricter immigration policy and more thorough screening."", '“I know the White House presented some explanations as to why each of those countries, but I can’t help but feel very targeted, being a Muslim immigration attorney,” Karim said. “The countries are majority Muslim, unfortunately.”', ""Immigration advocates said that, unlike Trump's previous travel ban, which caught them off guard, they expected the president would enact a similar policy in his second term. Trump’s 2017 ban immediately barred Muslims from entering the country, leaving some stranded at airports or unable to board flights."", 'But like his previous ban, the impact of the current ban taking effect next week will be felt by people trying to bring together families, those who landed a job in the U.S., who had tours or visits planned, who planned to study here or were looking forward to a cultural exchange.', 'It took three tries for Trump, in his previous administration, to come up with a travel ban that the U.S. Supreme Court would accept. Lower courts nixed the first version, and the administration kept revising it until the high court accepted its third version in June 2018. Immigration and civil rights groups opposed all three versions.', 'Raha Wala, vice president of strategy and partnerships at the National Immigration Law Center, said that challenging the latest ban “will be an uphill battle” because the Supreme Court decision is the law of the land.', 'Edward Cuccia, an immigration attorney in New York City, said that blocking the latest ban could be tougher now than in 2017.', '“Trump got smarter this time,” he said, explaining that the mix of countries makes it harder to argue that the ban is discriminatory.', ""Also, the implementation won't be as abrupt, and the argument that the singled-out countries do not vet the documents of their nationals well may hold up in court, according to Cuccia."", 'Even so, the implications are vast for the people who are affected and are not a security threat, he said.', '“What is this going to mean for family unification? There’s a lot of countries here!” Cuccia said. “And then, there are people that maybe had business dealings, people who wanted to do investments here in the United States or come over on temporary work visas, student visas or even just to visit. … That seems to be gone out the window.”', 'Wala called the justification for the ban — that visa overstays present a national security threat and the inability to fully vet visa travelers in those countries — a “fig leaf.”', 'If there is a gap in vetting, “that’s worth taking a look at,” he said, but he added that “all kinds of people overstay their visas — and just because someone overstayed their visa and committed a crime, we just have to get away from this guilt by association concept.”', ""For Wala, the newly announced ban cannot be separated from the president's previous policies and statements."", '""This ban started as the president saying he was going to have a complete and total shutdown of Muslims in the country. And he also said he wants to ban folks — and pardon my French here — from s---hole countries,"" Wala said.', 'In Miami, Colina said he was glad the ban would prevent officials of Maduro’s regime in Venezuela and their families ""who always find a way"" to get a visa to enter the country, ""but they are a minority, and the partial ban will negatively impact the larger community and it’s not fair.”', 'Suzanne Gamboa is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.', 'Carmen Sesin is a reporter for NBC News based in Miami, Florida.', 'Nicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.', 'Orlando Matos is an NBC News producer based in Havana, Cuba.

RESTRICTING THE ENTRY OF FOREIGN NATIONALS TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES FROM FOREIGN TERRORISTS AND OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS,https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/restricting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety-threats/,"['BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n \nA PROCLAMATION', 'During my first Administration, I restricted the entry of foreign nationals into the United States, which successfully prevented national security threats from reaching our borders and which the Supreme Court upheld.  In Executive Order 14161 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), I stated that it is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes. ', 'I also stated that the United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or our national interests.  More importantly, the United States must identify such aliens before their admission or entry into the United States.  The United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the United States do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists or other threats to our national security.', 'I directed the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to identify countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f).  After completing that process, the Secretary of State determined that a number of countries remain deficient with regards to screening and vetting.  Many of these countries have also taken advantage of the United States in their exploitation of our visa system and their historic failure to accept back their removable nationals. ', 'As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.  I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks.  Nationals of some countries also pose significant risks of overstaying their visas in the United States, which increases burdens on immigration and law enforcement components of the United States, and often exacerbates other risks related to national security and public safety.', 'Some of the countries with inadequacies face significant challenges to reform efforts.  Others have made important improvements to their protocols and procedures, and I commend them for these efforts.  But until countries with identified inadequacies address them, members of my Cabinet have recommended certain conditional restrictions and limitations.  I have considered and largely accepted those recommendations and impose the limitations set forth below on the entry into the United States by the classes of foreign nationals identified in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation.', 'NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclamation, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions.  I therefore hereby proclaim the following:', 'Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks and other national security or public-safety threats.  Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with visa adjudications and other immigration processes play a critical role in implementing that policy.  These protocols enhance our ability to detect foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism, or otherwise pose a safety threat, and they aid our efforts to prevent such individuals from entering the United States.', '(b)  Information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices of foreign governments are important for the effectiveness of the screening and vetting protocols and procedures of the United States.  Governments manage the identity and travel documents of their nationals and residents. They also control the circumstances under which they provide information about their nationals to other governments, including information about known or suspected terrorists and criminal-history information.  It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to take all necessary and appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing and identity-management protocols and practices and to regularly share their identity and threat information with the immigration screening and vetting systems of the United States.', '(c)  Section 2(b) of Executive Order 14161 directed the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, within 60 days of the date of that order, to jointly submit to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, a report identifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension on the entry or admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).', '(d)  On April 9, 2025, the Secretary of State, with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, presented the report described in subsection (c) of this section, recommending that entry restrictions and limitations be placed on foreign nationals of several countries.  The report identified countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full suspension of admissions and countries that warrant a partial suspension of admission.', '(e)  In evaluating the recommendations from the Secretary of State and in determining what restrictions to impose for each country, I consulted with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, appropriate Assistants to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  I considered foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals.  And I further considered various factors, including each country’s screening and vetting capabilities, information sharing policies, and country-specific risk factors — including whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals. ', 'I also considered the different risks posed by aliens admitted on immigrant visas and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas.  Persons admitted on immigrant visas become lawful permanent residents of the United States.  Such persons may present national security or public-safety concerns that may be distinct from those admitted as nonimmigrants.  The United States affords lawful permanent residents more enduring rights than it does to nonimmigrants.  Lawful permanent residents are more difficult to remove than nonimmigrants, even after national security concerns arise, which increases the costs and aggravates the dangers of errors associated with admitting such individuals.  And although immigrants are generally subject to more extensive vetting than nonimmigrants, such vetting is far less reliable when the country from which someone seeks to emigrate maintains inadequate identity-management or information-sharing policies or otherwise poses risks to the national security of the United States.', 'I reviewed these factors and assessed these goals, with a particular focus on crafting country-specific restrictions.  This approach was designed to encourage cooperation with the subject countries in recognition of each country’s unique circumstances.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are, in my judgment, necessary to prevent the entry or admission of foreign nationals about whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose to the United States.  The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are necessary to garner cooperation from foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives.', '(f)  After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries:  Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants.', '(g)  I have determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries:  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants. ', '(h)  Sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation describe some of the identity-management or information-sharing inadequacies that led me to impose restrictions.  These inadequacies are sufficient to justify my finding that unrestricted entry of nationals from the named countries would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and many such details are classified.', 'Sec. 2.  Full Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.  The entry into the United States of nationals of the following countries is hereby suspended and limited, as follows, subject to the categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers described in section 5 of this proclamation:', '(a)  Afghanistan', '(i)   The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan.  Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Fiscal Year 2023 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (“Overstay Report”), Afghanistan had a business/tourist (B-1/B-2) visa overstay rate of 9.70 percent and a student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay rate of 29.30 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Afghanistan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(b)  Burma', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Burma had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent.  Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Burma as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(c)  Chad', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent.  According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent.  The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.  ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Chad as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(d)  Republic of the Congo', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.14 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of the Republic of the Congo as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(e)  Equatorial Guinea', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 70.18 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Equatorial Guinea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(f)  Eritrea', '(i)   The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea.  Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals.  Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.43 percent.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Eritrea as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(g)  Haiti', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Haiti had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05 percent.  Additionally, hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.  This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.  As is widely known, Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Haiti as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(h)  Iran', '(i)   Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.  Iran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Iran as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended.', '(i)  Libya', '(i)   There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya.  The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Libya as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(j)  Somalia', '(i)   Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects.  A persistent terrorist threat also emanates from Somalia’s territory.  The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven.  Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations.  Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.  The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement.  Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Somalia as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(k)  Sudan', '(i)   Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  According to the Overstay Report, Sudan had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 26.30 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 28.40 percent. ', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Sudan as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', '(l)  Yemen', '(i)   Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  The government does not have physical control over its own territory.  Since January 20, 2025, Yemen has been the site of active United States military operations.', '(ii)  The entry into the United States of nationals of Yemen as immigrants and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.', 'Sec. 3.  Partial Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern.', '(a)  Burundi', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Burundi had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Burundi as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Burundi to the extent permitted by law.', '(b)  Cuba', '(i)    Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.  The Government of Cuba does not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with the United States.  Cuba has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 18.75 percent.', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Cuba as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Cuba to the extent permitted by law.', '(c)  Laos', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Laos had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent.  Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Laos as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas, is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Laos to the extent permitted by law.', '(d)  Sierra Leone', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent.  Sierra Leone has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Sierra Leone as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Sierra Leone to the extent permitted by law.', '(e)  Togo', '(i)    According to the Overstay Report, Togo had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 19.03 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.05 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Togo as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B‑2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Togo to the extent permitted by law.', '(f)  Turkmenistan', '(i)   According to the Overstay Report, Turkmenistan had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 21.74 percent. ', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Turkmenistan as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Turkmenistan to the extent permitted by law.', '(g)  Venezuela', '(i)    Venezuela lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.  Venezuela has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals.  According to the Overstay Report, Venezuela had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 9.83 percent.', '(ii)   The entry into the United States of nationals of Venezuela as immigrants, and as nonimmigrants on B‑1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas is hereby suspended.', '(iii)  Consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals of Venezuela to the extent permitted by law.', 'Sec. 4.  Scope and Implementation of Suspensions and Limitations.  (a)  Scope.  Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any exceptions made pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the suspensions of and limitations on entry pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:', '(i)   are outside the United States on the applicable effective date of this proclamation; and', '(ii)  do not have a valid visa on the applicable effective date of this proclamation.', '(b)  Exceptions.

The president is also partially restricting and limiting U.S. entry for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The administration’s travel ban has been in the works for months, following through on a Day One executive order that directed agencies to identify countries where vetting visitors and visa applicants is considered infeasible and poses a threat to national security. The extensive planning speaks to the White House’s efforts to pass legal muster: Trump’s 2017 travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries suffered a series of courtroom defeats before a slimmed down version eventually took effect.', '“We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm, and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe,” Trump said in a video posted by the White House on Wednesday.', 'The ban exempts existing visa holders, lawful permanent residents, specific visa categories and individuals the government determines serve U.S. national interests. Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio performed a security review of “high-risk regions” and made recommendations for which countries should be slapped with new restrictions. The administration looked at factors such as terrorist activity, visa security cooperation, a country’s ability to verify travelers’ identities, record keeping of nationals’ criminal histories, as well as the rate of illegal visa overstays, the president added.', 'The White House considered including a much larger list of countries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the planning and granted anonymity to describe it. Trump said Wednesday that the list could be altered if countries improve conditions and meet U.S. vetting standards, and that others could be added if they pose a risk.', 'Trump’s action comes just days after a man in Boulder, Colorado, threw Molotov cocktails and used a “makeshift flamethrower” on pro-Israel protesters, heightening concerns over terrorism. Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. in 2022 with a non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2023, according to the Department of Homeland Security.', 'He also applied for asylum in 2022, according to DHS. He was charged with federal and state hate crimes, as the White House highlights the case as an example of how unchecked immigration poses a threat to national security.', 'The Trump administration moved quickly to try to deport Soliman’s family — his wife and five children — but a federal judge in California on Wednesday temporarily blocked the efforts. The family was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on Tuesday.', 'Trump has long framed immigration as a national security issue, leaning into this argument even more so in his second term as he looks to rapidly remove undocumented immigrants from the country and declares immigration an “invasion.” From the White House to Justice Department lawyers in court, the Trump administration has argued that the president has the power to unilaterally determine who poses a significant risk to the United States given his inherent authority over national security.', '“The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed for our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don’t want them,” Trump said in a video released by the White House announcing his ban. “In the 21st century, we’ve seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places all over the world.”', 'The White House’s planning for Trump’s latest travel ban marks a departure from 2017, when the president’s haphazard rollout of restrictions on nationals from some majority-Muslim countries spurred numerous legal challenges and widespread chaos at U.S. airports.', 'Trump was forced to alter the travel ban twice before the Supreme Court ultimately greenlit a version of the policy in 2018. The court, in a 5-4 decision, affirmed the president’s powers over matters of national security, delivering a major victory to an administration looking to restrict immigration into the country.', 'That version, which former President Joe Biden terminated when he took office in 2021, implemented a range of travel restrictions against eight countries — Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea, Chad and Venezuela.

Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.', '“Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country,” Trump said Thursday. “The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we’re getting them out one by one, we’re not stopping until we get them out.”', 'For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.', 'Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday’s travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.', 'Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.', 'The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.', 'Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.', 'Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.', 'The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.', 'The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.', 'RELATED VIDEO\nTrump confirms on social media he authorized airstrikes on Somalia', 'Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.', 'The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.', 'Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.', 'Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad’s overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”', 'The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.', '“Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.', 'The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”', '“While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.', 'The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.', 'The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan’s official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington’s two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.', 'The Trump administration targeted Yemen’s Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.', 'Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country’s central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.', 'Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump’s administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.', 'Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”', 'Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.', 'Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.', 'The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nMyanmar’s earthquake devastated the war-torn nation.

Trump's ban on travel shows what he's learned,https://www.yahoo.com/news/travel-ban-2-0-trump-231727589.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'When President Donald Trump abruptly unleashed his ban on people coming from Muslim-majority countries in 2017, chaos erupted at U.S. airports. Protests broke out in major cities across the country.', 'Legal challenges stymied the administration, which ultimately had to slim down its order to pass constitutional muster.', 'This time, as Trump leveled new restrictions against 19 nations, the reaction was mostly muted and the legal justification appears more deliberate.', 'It’s the nature of the do-over presidency, which has provided Trump with a unique opportunity to build on his first term. And no policy better captures the way in which Trump is demonstrating he’s learned from past mistakes or benefitting from a Democratic party less inclined to fight over border security quite like his travel ban 2.0.', '“The first version of those travel restrictions were not upheld because the court wanted to see ‘what’s your methodology, what’s the criteria in which you’re making these national security decisions?” said Chad Wolf, acting DHS secretary during the president’s first term. “And then once we went back and further validated it and showed the court, they affirmed it. So I definitely think that they built on that, and then probably expanded it as well.”', 'Trump has used his first five months in office to propose a host of immigration-related ideas that he batted around during his first term but ultimately did not pursue, including an attempt to end birthright citizenship and a plan to revoke Chinese student visas. His team has also taken on an aggressive legal strategy, an effort designed to expand the president’s power over the immigration system and implement policy changes more difficult for future presidents to unravel. And Trump released dozens of immigration executive orders in his first week in office, many that directed his agencies to begin exploring the sweeping restrictions he promised on the campaign trail — a torrent of action that wouldn’t have been possible without the coordination across the president’s team, MAGA allies and conservative think tanks that spent the last four years planning a robust policy agenda.', 'To be sure, lawsuits over the new travel ban are in the works. Immigration advocates and some legal experts say the new ban, while perhaps better planned than the original version, is nonetheless unconstitutional.', '“The new ban is being promulgated in a context in which President Trump has shown a defiance of due process and disregard for judicial decisions that exceeds anything in his first term,” said Jonathan Hafetz, a law professor at Seton Hall. “This will also likely factor in how courts evaluate the new travel ban, and could make them more skeptical of the administration’s claims but also more wary of directly confronting the administration.”', 'And more broadly, the president’s immigration agenda has faced several setbacks, adverse legal rulings and a haphazard approach that has often undermined the administration’s case in court. Judges have said immigrants have been wrongly deported — without due process — and have blocked Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that the White House relied upon for authority to deport more than 100 accused of gang membership to an El Salvadoran prison. And his hurried deportations tactics have resulted in at least four men being improperly deported in violation of court orders. The administration was forced to bring one of them back to the U.S. in recent days.', 'The White House has also faced steep hurdles in other aspects of its immigration agenda. Judges ruled that his executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship was flagrantly unconstitutional, and the policy faced skepticism from the Supreme Court last month.', 'But when it comes to his new travel ban, legal experts on both sides of the aisle say the president is likely on stronger footing should he face challenges.', '""Under Trump 2.0 there’s been an aspect of doing that legwork in advance, so that it would fall under those parameters,” said Morgan Bailey, a partner at Mayer Brown and a former senior official at DHS under the Biden and Trump administrations. “There may be some challenges. At the same time, having the Supreme Court decision from Trump 1.0 could put this administration in a really strong position.”', 'Trump’s team has been refining his latest travel ban for months, marking a departure from his slapdash approach in 2017. The president on Wednesday said the State Department considered factors such as terrorist activity, visa security cooperation, a country’s ability to verify travelers’ identities, record keeping of nationals’ criminal histories, as well as the rate of illegal visa overstays. The proclamation also broke down the government’s reasoning for each country’s selection, as well as their visa overstay rates.', '“Campaigning is a lot about policy and planning, and governing is about the now and reacting, so this has been a true mix” said Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and former Trump administration appointee. “Granted, Trump take two has been arguably the largest runway any president has ever had in terms of preparing for their second term. So I think you’re seeing more of the granular and nuanced implementation around some of these policies.”', 'Trump’s 2017 restrictions shocked the nation, and legal setbacks forced the administration to alter the policy twice before the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a version the following year, affirming the president’s powers over matters of national security. The final policy implemented a range of travel restrictions for nationals of eight countries — Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea, Chad and Venezuela. Chad was later removed from the list.', 'And almost immediately after that first order was announced, thousands of protesters marched in cities across the country, while attorneys from major law firms, nonprofits and immigrant rights groups ran to airports to help those detained. There was widespread Democratic outcry in Washington and beyond, and the so-called “Muslim ban” emerged as a major issue in the 2020 Democratic Primary — with then-President Joe Biden reversing the policy on his first day in the White House.', 'White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Democrats have abandoned claims that Trump’s first-term policy was a “Muslim ban” and “their performative protests,” adding that the president is “keeping his promises to put America first.”', 'This executive order has also been met with far less outrage, in part, because of the administration’s effort to flood the zone and keep their opponents off balance.', '“There’s just so many attacks coming from the Trump administration on all fronts,” said Kerri Talbot, co-director of the Immigration Hub, predicting that when the new order takes effect on Monday, there will be coordinated demonstrations.', 'But the more methodical way in which this ban on travel was issued may give it greater staying power. The 2017 ban applied to U.S. citizens traveling from the nations on Trump’s original list and because it went into effect immediately, it affected people on planes flying back into the country. The ban issued late Wednesday does not apply to those with legal status in the U.S., and includes exemptions for existing visa holders, lawful permanent residents and some others. ', 'While the political pushback may be scarce, Trump wasn’t the only one who had extra time to prepare for his second term. Immigration groups and legal organizations have analyzed Trump’s proposals, drafted legal briefs, coordinated messaging and organized aid for immigrants and asylum seekers — preparation that has set up a series of contentious court battles.', 'Trump allies are prepared for the possibility that travel ban 2.0 could face challenges in the courts, though they’re much more confident given the 2018 SCOTUS ruling.', '“I have no doubt that they believe that you can get some lower court judge to issue an injunction where they claim that somehow this order is different from the prior order,” said Hans Von Spakovsky, a senior legal and judicial studies fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “But they will lose.”', ' Brakkton Booker and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhNbWhyVUZRd1gxTkZZVGRNVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdhSlFaUnRKUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

What unites countries under Trump’s travel ban is American imperialism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/trump-travel-ban-imperialism,"['US’s cruel escalation of policy puts misplaced target on vulnerable nations such as Afghanistan and Sudan', 'T\nhe list of countries banned by the Trump administration’s newest order seems to have no rhyme or reason. Little connects Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, all targeted for a total ban, or Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela, all targeted for restrictions. The reasoning stated in the order is that they all pose security threats measured by “whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals”.', 'Visa overstays, the order elaborates, “indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws”. Yet the latest data on overstays from Customs and Border Protection does show these countries high on the list, along with others not included.', 'If we sit with this list a little longer, though, with attention to the history of the world we share, we can see a different unifying logic. All of these countries are in the global south, their citizens are racialized as Black or brown and Muslim. Most have high poverty rates that hover at or above half their population. Several have recently been sites of social upheaval or horrific wars. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan, for example, all appear on the World Food Program’s list of the world’s most dire food crises.', 'These facts do not, as the travel ban assumes, tell of the inherent violence of people from these nations, nor of a penchant to “disregard” law. In fact, even the data on overstays says nothing of people’s legal status. Nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, El Salvador, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and Venezuela have long had a right to apply for temporary protected status due to the insecurity of their countries. We do not know how many of the so-called “overstayers” applied for other protections like asylum.', 'The poverty and insecurity of these nations are mainly an indication that they have been subject to imperialism, including US military and economic intervention and coercion.', 'You cannot understand the endemic violence or economic destitution that forces people to leave Haiti without attending to both the French extortion of the island nation in exchange for their freedom from enslavement, and the United States’ occupation of it. You cannot understand the mass exodus of people from Afghanistan, one of the world’s largest refugee populations, without understanding the United States’ funding of the mujahideen, or the so-called “war on terror”, that did little more than further destabilize the nation. Iran’s current regime is only possible because the US supported British efforts in destroying Iranian democracy to save British Petroleum.', 'US sanctions, whether in Iran or Venezuela or in Cuba, have not contributed to pressuring regime change, but rather to economic devastation and mass displacement. American shrapnel has been pulled from the bodies of Yemeni children. Since March, 250 people have been killed in US strikes on Saada and Sanaa, at least 68 of whom were detained African migrants.', 'Time and time again data shows that African countries such as oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Chad, ravaged by companies such as ExxonMobil, and gold-rich Sudan, are not victims of poverty, but victims of theft. The United Nations estimates that $86bn leaves the continent each year in “illicit financial flows”, or theft through criminal activities and tax evasion. What’s more, between 1970 and 2022, countries in the global south, including those on this list, are estimated to have paid more than $2.5tn in interest alone to the benefit of the global north. Thomas Sankara, a former president of Burkina Faso, once called debt a “skillfully managed reconquest of Africa”.', 'The wealthiest nations in the world are causing the climate crisis that the poorest nations pay for. Climate activists estimate that governments in the global north owe $5tn each year to countries in the global south for the devastation they are causing them.', 'Seen from this vantage, Trump’s travel ban, which proudly cites what came to be known as the “Muslim ban” of his first administration in its opening paragraphs, is a cruel escalation of a longstanding policy of profiting off Black and brown lives and disposing of the most vulnerable among them.', 'In displacement camps in New York and Tijuana and the Aegean islands of Greece, I have met pharmacists, artists, DJs and journalists from many of the targeted countries. Just this week I spoke to a political activist who, forced to flee a massacre in one of the targeted countries, left her three young children behind. Speaking to me after the issuance of this ban, she worried whether she would be able to secure her asylum, which is currently being adjudicated, and whether she could ever reunify her family. Her voice broke as she said: “I wish they could understand that I never wanted to come here.”', 'Trump justified the ban by referencing a recent incident in which an Egyptian man in Boulder, Colorado, injured 12 people calling for the release of Israeli hostages (though notably Egypt is not on the list). That this one act justifies the banning of millions of people is absurd. This latest ban is simply another installment in a series of policies meant to “Make America white again”, following a ban on asylum and a cancellation of humanitarian parole. It comes as attacks on our immigrant students continue, particularly those who dare speak out against the US funding of Gaza’s decimation.', 'It is not the people of these nations that are a threat to the security of the United States. It is the United States that has long been a threat to them, robbing them of their wealth, destroying their institutions and environments, and then denying them participation in the safety built at their expense. We should be atoning for our sins, not exacerbating them.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhNbWhyVUZRd1gxTkZZVGRNVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdhSlFaUnRKUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

No title found,https://www.city-journal.org/multimedia/trump-travel-ban-what-comes-next,"['City Journal Podcast', 'Charles Fain Lehman, Daniel Di Martino, Tal Fortgang, and Renu Mukherjee discuss the revised travel ban, the Democratic Party’s struggles with young men, and renting vs. owning.', '', 'Finally, a reason to check your email.', 'Sign up for our free newsletter today.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Welcome back to the City Journal Podcast. I’m your host Charles Fain Lehman, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and senior editor of City Journal. Joining me on the panel today are Daniel Di Martino, responsible for immigration things at the Manhattan Institute, Tal Fortgang, legal guy at the Manhattan Institute, and Renu Mukherjee, who works on education and politics and really everything we throw at her at the Manhattan Institute. Thank everyone as always for being on.', 'I’m going to take us right into the news of the day and Daniel will be on deck very shortly to tell us what the heck is actually happening because right now I’m literally working off of his tweets. Last night, the Trump administration announced a revised travel ban, nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen—and yes I did read that—have been banned from entering the country. And then there were a number of other countries where there’s a limitation on what visas can come in. This is obviously sort of a big policy dispute in the first Trump administration. It seems like they’re returning to it with gusto. So I want to get into both what this augurs and also the merits of the policy. I will note that a lot of people have connected this to the Molotov cocktail attack in Colorado last weekend, where the offender involved was an Egyptian illegal immigrant. Egypt is not on this list, but I think this is seen as being connected to the administration’s sort of broader anti-immigrant terrorism agenda. But Daniel, why don’t you, as the immigration guy on our panel, as I said earlier, break down a little bit more what’s going on here.', 'Yeah, which by the way, Egypt is not on the list, but they did include a provision in the proclamation saying they will study adding Egypt in like the next six months or so. So, you know, I think it’s important to know that this is obviously not a Muslim ban. This is a list of countries that simply have very high visa overstay rates and countries that just don’t share security or don’t have any records, right? So those are the countries in the full ban list.', 'It’s important to also know though, that this is not that it affects people who live in those countries and are from those countries. It affects citizens of those countries, even if they live elsewhere. So that’s where probably I would have an issue with. If for example, there’s a Haitian, like there are many actually Haitians who live in Chile and they happen to be professionals who don’t have Chilean citizenship. Why should they be banned from traveling to the U.S.? It doesn’t make much sense, but those are smaller cases.', 'And so it’s, it’s a big ban. I would say it’s bigger than the first Trump administration banning the list of countries, but it’s smaller in the sense that it doesn’t affect anyone who already has a visa to come to the U.S. In the previous ban, people who already had their visas and their travels, everything got upended. It was a lot of disorder. This is really more of a ban on issuing new visas more than anything.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: So if I’m like a Haitian who’s here on temporary protected status or if I’m…', 'Daniel Di Martino: Nobody inside the US is affected today.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Nobody said the U.S. is affected? Or if I’m a refugee from the regime in Afghanistan, similarly, I’m not affected?', 'Daniel Di Martino: Yeah. If you’re already in the US, nothing is affected. The Afghan allies, even though Afghanistan is on the list, are supposed to not be affected for the Afghan special visas. So let me give you the best example. Imagine you are from, I don’t know, few of these countries even have people with tourist visas. But imagine you happen to be somebody from Congo who has a tourist visa already. You can still come to the U.S.', 'There is more of a question over whether if your visa expires where you are at, whether you will be allowed to get a new visa. That visas are issued for 10 years, tourist visas. There’s really no, not as many people I think as the news will tell you will be affected.', 'Renu Mukherjee: Do you think that the Democrats will be successful if they play this up as a Muslim ban and not as simply trying to cut down on the number of countries that have high rates of visa overstate? Because I imagine that’s what they’re going to do.', 'Daniel Di Martino: It’s just obviously not a Muslim ban, right? Because Burma is not a Muslim country. Congo is not a Muslim country. Equatorial Guinea, Haiti, mean Venezuela is on the partial list, Laos, Cuba, Sierra Leone, Togo, mean none of these are Muslim countries.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Burma, they’re actively repressing Muslims.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I agree, do you...', 'Tal Fortgang: What? Sorry, Renu, go ahead.', 'Renu Mukherjee: Just really quickly, I agree with you, but I feel like there’s some powerful rhetoric there for them to focus on, for example, Afghanistan and say, you know, there’s people in addition to Afghan allies that might want refugee status, might need to get out, or, you know, there are enough Muslim countries included. So I’m just curious what you think about that.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I think the most powerful argument will be that most of these countries are totalitarian regimes, and you are really just preventing, in some cases, student visas. In all of these cases, are banned from both lists of countries. So why should you prohibit somebody escaping Eritrea or Sudan, who happens to be really smart, right? Obviously, the number of people affected is really tiny. We’re only talking about a few thousand people total, really, who are not tourists. So the numbers are small, but I do agree it’s not a good look.', 'Tal Fortgang: I’m thinking about this as a lawyer in two different ways. One is that I just haven’t actually read the thing and I’m already prepared to to opine on this. The other is that the procedures and the logic that go into taking executive action in this way matter. If this gets to court, then that’s the kind of thing that a court will scrutinize.', 'Do we have any indications about what’s going on behind the scenes? Is it the kind of thing that we will have to infer from the list that we end up with? I mean, Daniel, you seem to be following this closer than any of us. Is there any indication of how this came about?', 'Daniel Di Martino: You know, you’re probably familiar with Trump v. Hawaii, right? The court case that upheld the first travel ban. In my opinion, this one is on a much more solid legal ground because it doesn’t apply to anybody who already has a visa. It’s just a suspension of issuing new visas. And the State Department of Foreign Policy, they could suspend all new visa issuances today if they wanted to. Like, they really have the legal authority to do this without question.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: So I want to, want to, and this comes back to Renu’s question, but I’m really into the bigger politics of this, because I think there is this big mismatch, right? Like, you know, in Trump One, the like “Muslim ban,” which is unfortunately like what he said he was going to do, and that’s part of how they tried to nail him on it, was just a huge mess. And I think that that was something that Democrats were almost immediately able to capitalize on. People may remember 2017, the first big anti-Trump protests were about his travel ban.', 'The people at airports, there was a whole thing. And it seems like they have much more effectively positioned themselves this time around as part of what is ultimately remains Trump’s most popular issue, his positioning on immigration, where he’s like, a majority or close to majority of country continues to be on his side on these topics. So I wonder, to Renu’s point, is there going to be any fight picked over this? Or has Trump actually won on this issue compared to eight years ago?', 'Daniel Di Martino: Think about it, they waited until right after the terrorist attack from a visa overstay. And this is especially to countries related to this. The timing is perfect. The exemptions are sure that the most sympathetic cases, like immediate relatives of US citizens, people with other citizenships, like there’s a lot of Cubans, for example, who have Spanish citizenship. They’re still allowed to travel. Or I don’t know, people from other countries that might have obtained a second citizenship, they’re allowed to travel.', 'They really went through the list to ensure that only the least sympathetic cases are excluded. You don’t issue new visas. And I’m thinking about it on a more long-term standpoint. Think about what the effects on other immigration policies are of this. You will have less overstays, right? Because these are countries with very high overstay rates. And then the most important part, the permanent visas, the green cards that people from these countries, it’s not that many, but I’m sure it’s over 10,000, 20,000 a year between all of them, will go to people of other countries, probably from countries that use more employment-based visas, which actually will upskill the immigrant flow.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I think Trump will ultimately win in the court of public opinion on this. What he has to do though is, like you said at the top of the episode, Charles, he needs to connect it to instances of domestic terrorism, of support for foreign terrorist organizations that are absolutely so unequivocally egregious that just any person with, any sort of sentient person will look at this and say, well, obviously we don’t want this person, his family in our country. And it’s not just that.', 'This attack happened from an Egyptian national. And I know, Daniel, you said, like, Egypt isn’t on the list. It might be six months from now. But this is an individual that overstayed his visa and came, you know, on a travel visa and then applied for asylum and was rejected.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I’m like poor asylum, can you believe it? The guy who applied for asylum then committed the terrorist attack. It’s outrageous, the whole thing. We should apply for asylum against him! America needed asylum against the guy.', 'Tal Fortgang: Yes, I can believe it, Daniel.', 'It’s never really been clear, and maybe this whole episode will help clarify precisely what the Democrats, not just political position, but the philosophical position behind their immigration stances, what that position is. Because sometimes it gets framed as a kind of like, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, which is kind of like, qua immigration is good. We just want more people coming from other countries. Right, it’s an engine for all kinds of good things.', 'But so often it’s framed as like we need to let, I guess this is the poor and downtrodden version of it. Like we need to let the least of the world into our country, especially. Like we have a special responsibility given how much we destabilize the world and how responsible we are for the world’s ills. Right.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Immigration as reparations.', 'Renu Mukherjee: Yes, colonialism.', 'Tal Fortgang: I think there’s a strong post-colonial strain that tends to get mixed in with universalistic and idealistic rhetoric about letting people onto our shores. This is an interesting test case because it’s not really clearly in either set of principles there.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: To this point though, think the administration, there’s sort of a success mode and a failure mode in terms of responding to that. The administration will be on relatively strong ground in the court of public opinion if it’s able to make the case, for lack of a word, it’s the case for immigration discrimination. Some people we want to come, and we like those people. Other people we don’t want to come, and we don’t like those people. What you’re looking at here, at least in theory, is people who are either, as Daniel alluded to, a high risk of abusing the immigration system by virtue of being visa overstays or they’re coming from countries that we just can’t trust, right? We don’t believe that they are going to share with us the relevant information to make viable judgments. That’s, you know, that is ultimately predicated on trying to make judgments about who should arrive that’s very different from, and I think part of why they got in trouble the first time just saying again as the president so inaptly put it, imposing a “Muslim ban” right? It’s like we’re going to prohibit people from a certain protected class writ large coming to the United States. Turns out, they can do that, but it’s not hugely popular to do that. People in America don’t love that. And so I think, in some senses, it’s the case that whoever is more discriminating wins on this issue, right? The criticism that Tal’s making of the democratic approach is like, we’re just going to open the gates, and in fact, we will give special privileges to the people who hate us the most. And then the Congress is on the Republican side, we’re going to close the gates to everybody and we’re just going say that we hate everybody. You don’t want that. That’s probably not, that is equally not a winner.', 'Daniel Di Martino: Right. You’re so right about the whole universalistic and really reparation-style motivation by Democrats on the open border side, that they’re defending the family of the terrorists now from getting deported. Come on, a court is now putting an injunction against deporting the family of the terrorist? If they can’t be deported, they won’t want anyone deported. Give me a break. Now, I would prefer interrogation and jail, not like letting them go free. I feel like that’s, this is too quick. Like you need way more interrogation here.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Look at the crimes!', 'Tal Fortgang: Can we talk about this for a second because I’m...', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Yeah, was going to use, let’s use this to segue into the exit so we can talk about this, but go ahead.', 'Tal Fortgang: Sure. Yeah, I just, I have this really intuitive aversion.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: And sorry, just for context, we’re talking about the family of the guy who committed the attack in Boulder is being scheduled for deportation, a lower court blocked that effort. Sorry, go ahead, Tal.', 'Tal Fortgang: Yeah, I have a kind of visceral aversion to any indication of blood guilt. It really bothers me when, as the Bible says, when sons are held responsible for the sins of the fathers and fathers for their sons. On the other hand, Charles, as you pointed out on social media and elsewhere, deportation is not a reflection of blood guilt so much as a considered judgment that such people are likely to pose a risk to our nation’s security that we need not tolerate. So I’m really torn on this one. I was kind of hoping we could argue both sides.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: I mean, to me, I think that distinction is everything, which is to say you cannot punish them for his actions. That’s not permissible. But a punishment is a deprivation of something you’re otherwise entitled to after process of law, right? My property. Yeah. But like, and again, at court, they don’t have the right to be here, right? They are visa overstayers. They are not entitled to presence in the United States. They’re entitled to process.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I mean, they have no risk of persecution in Egypt, let’s be real.', 'And it wasn’t the man, it was the terrorist who filed the asylum claim. The claim was disestimated because of the crime, the horrendous crime he committed, and therefore the entire claim is moot, so they are deportable. Now, I think for, maybe I’m just speaking without knowledge because I’m not in law enforcement, but maybe the law enforcement already did all their job with the family. But if they haven’t, they seem like a really important source to keep at least as long as the trial is happening and then they can deport them.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: I mean, you know, I think, Tal, this is the point that I made on social media was if you buy this argument that they can’t be deported as, you know, as because there’s some nexus to his offense, the, what is being, the arguments being made here is because he committed a hate crime, they can’t be deported, which is like an obviously insane position, right? It’s like, you know, not only is it intrinsically insane, it’s also has like perverse implications. Like if you want your family to avoid deportation, go out and like fire bombs some Jews, and then you’ll be golden. I think that’s like not a situation we want.', 'Tal Fortgang: Well, there’s some truth to this. It’s like a reverse asylum claim. If you want to ensure that you are safe in the world’s worst countries, go out and attack Jews in the United States of America. You’ll be welcomed as a hero.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: It’s true. All right. All right. I want to take this out. So I want to ask folks about the trajectory of the ban. Do we think, I mean, it’s going to be stayed by the courts. That’s just going to happen. That’s what happens now. But do we think that this is going to be upheld as good law? Is this going to still be in effect at the end of Trump’s second term? Daniel, you’re the expert. What do you think? We’ll just defer to you basically. But I’ll just give it another tip.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I think it will, and I think the stays will be very brief, because now there is Supreme Court precedent. So any stay, in my opinion, will be extremely partisan judges that are trying to go around the already existing precedent of the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii. And in fact, I think the ban will just flock to it. Countries will be added, more countries will be added, and then perhaps a few will be removed.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Fair, okay. Tal?', 'Tal Fortgang: One of the moves that the Biden administration helped pioneer with some of its executive actions on things like student loan forgiveness was tailoring policies so that very few people or institutions, if anyone, had standing to sue. And I’d be interested to see how this particular action was tailored. If it was done cleverly, there may not be plaintiffs who actually have Article 3 standing under our Constitution to challenge this. So I’m going to wait and see what the particulars of the law. Now I’m being a responsible lawyer. And that’s what I’ll say.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Yeah. Okay, Renu, what’s your projection?', 'Renu Mukherjee: I echo Daniel and Tal. I think legally this will probably stand. I don’t think this is something that I envision once going to the Supreme Court. I imagine Roberts writing the opinion and him kind of ultimately upholding this. That would be my guess. In terms of just how this will play politically, I think if the administration is able to connect this with, like I said before, just horrible instances of visa overstay and just domestic terrorism, Americans will be in favor of it, and I also think the victims that Democrats are trying to paint out of this such as the, yes, with the whole notion of just association with her terrorist dad, but I mean most Americans are not going to feel sympathetic to the daughter of this terrorist who wanted to go to medical school, in the way that they don’t feel bad that European princesses might not be able to go back to Harvard for undergrad. These are not the victims that are going to play well with the American public.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Yeah, I hesitate to agree with the entire panel because it’s never a good sign when the panel is in consensus. I’ll say, look, I probably agree. That said, I think we should not discount the possibility of a particularly protracted process in the courts because that’s what’s defined the entire administration so far. So I would not count my chickens until they hatch. That said, yeah, I think they’re likely to prevail eventually for no other reason than they’ve already had this fight, right, as you guys have alluded to.', 'All right. I want to turn us now to a recently released analysis from the Speaking with American Men project, which attracted a great deal of derision over on X, formerly known as Twitter. And the SAM project, as it’s known, is an effort to understand why Democrats lost so badly with men in the 2024 election and what their general gender problem is. So it’s funded by, it’s like a collaboration. Ilyse Hogue, who’s formerly of NARAL is involved, a couple other people involved, they just put out their results of their first focus groups. They found that 27 percent of young men viewed the Democratic Party positively, created 43 percent for Republicans, just 46 percent of young men voted for Harris in 2024. The losses track across every racial group and the most pronounced hemorrhaging came among Latinos and black men.', 'So what do we make of this trend? What’s going on here? What are they missing in their focus groups and their SAM? I mean, do we buy their analysis or what’s going on?', 'Daniel Di Martino: As the youngest man in the panel, I’ll say, I think the problem Democrats have is that the perception, which is real, is that the Democratic Party hates masculinity. They hate young men, really. They hate everything that makes men different from women. And you might say, Daniel, that’s an exaggeration. No, think about it. Their policy is on education, right? Title IX, the trans issue, gender roles, in the workplace all the scholarships, all the preferences for women over men, just the role of sexuality. There’s a lot of things in which men have been disadvantaged by Democratic policies, Democratic rhetoric, really. I mean, this is the party that invented the entire term of toxic masculinity. And now they’re mad that men dislike them. Well, there’s a reason, it’s because they disliked us.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Renu, I want to make sure that we get the political scientists into here. What’s your take on the broader project and what’s going wrong here?', 'Renu Mukherjee: I was going to say that both with respect to the politics, also as being this sort of Daniel and I are around the same age, of late twenties and being like the woman on this panel. I would say that the Democrats problem with young men, 18 to 24, 18 to 30, whatever, can also be traced to just how they view women. Women are now the center of the movement and many left leaning, ideologically liberal women have come to view, as Daniel said, any sort of traditional display of masculinity, or even, you know, men who want to lift weights at the gym, anything like that, want to listen to certain types of music, you know, are somewhat in favor of traditional gender roles as needing to be exiled from the party. I also think of...', 'I think of the Black Lives Matter movement that has subsumed so much of the Democratic Party. The founders of that movement back in the early 2010s were three, quote, “queer” women, and they were very explicit saying, we don’t want men to have to do anything with this. Women are leading the movement, and we’re going to shove black men aside, which have historically been leading civil rights efforts. I feel like that sort of thinking has just been internalized by the Democratic Party. And I will put the blame, maybe people won’t like me saying this, but I will put the blame a lot on women with respect to this.', 'Tal Fortgang: I had a teacher in high school who would try to persuade everyone in his class that we should all be feminists. And the way he would try to explain it is like feminism isn’t really about women, right? It’s as much about men’s role in society as it is about women’s role in society. And really, when you think about it, it’s just about society, right? It’s just humanism. And so here we’ve replicated that dialectic, what Daniel says, it’s about their treatment of men. Renu adds, it’s about the way they think about women. So I will come to add, like actually the Democrats and the political left have embraced a vision of what our social life is meant to be and meant to look like that is demoralizing generally, in a way that I think is prone to show up, especially among men. The thing I think about in particular is that Democrats and the political left have emphasized a view of the world that is non-agentic. That is, that people do not have agency, they do not have the ability to really make their own decisions because of false consciousness, because of systemic this or that. For whatever reason, they’re not really in control of their lives. And that might be liberating to some people, but most people, particularly men who want to feel as though their life has a kind of purpose and meaning to it and don’t want to feel adrift and alienated, want to feel like their choices matter, and they will drift towards a worldview that says, you know what, I may not be a world changer, but at least I can do work that means something, earn for myself and a family and eventually come to reject the rejection of agency. I think that’s really like the broad picture of what’s going on.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: So I want to be the guy on the panel who disagrees with everybody. And sometimes this is right. I think on some level, everybody’s talking on this ideological level, how Democrats see the world. There’s merit to it. But then part of me is like, so I think I included this. The rising gender split is like an across developed democracies phenomenon. There’s just polling that showed Korean men have veered far to the right. If you look at the UK, women are way out to the left. I think it’s Canada. This is another example. You see this divergence. Part of what I think is going on here is beyond the sort of like, ideology often is sort of secondary to incentives. And part of what’s going on here is if you are competing for the marginal voter, you want to select for activation, all else being equal, and women are just much more civically engaged than men on every dimension, and that’s true cross-culturally. It’s like women are the ones who go out and do stuff. And so the returns to pick the expected value of picking up the marginal female voter is higher than the expected value of picking up the marginal male voter.', 'Our colleague Jesse Arm, a frequent panelist, had a good piece about this in the context of why does the Democratic Party, why is it so beholden to gender ideology still? And the answer was like basically you need activists not because they’re the base, not because they get you 49 percent of the vote, but because they get you the 50th percentile. They get you the marginal vote. And I think it is plausible that a similar dynamic is obtaining here, where like, you know, there, there is some incentive to go after women just because like women are who will ultimately show up in a way that men won’t. So, I mean, that is, you know, in, some sense, I agree with the ideological arguments, but then I want to push back and be like, well, but what do we make of this international phenomenon? Are there more structural explanations that could go on here?', 'Daniel Di Martino: Charles, I’m very sympathetic to their argument because even on the Republican Party, if you see the grassroots level, it is women who organize the events. It is the Republican Women’s Club that really get the things going. But if that was true, though, as a marginal incentive, then the Republican Party should have also pulled towards feminism. And that didn’t happen. The opposite, right? And that didn’t happen in any of these developed countries. So I wonder what is the role, well, first all the leftist parties in all these developed countries have actually pulled to feminism. So there is an ideological change that is happening in South Korea, in Spain, in Germany, in Canada, everywhere, right? But maybe it’s economic. Maybe it’s about women are now empowered after all these decades. They’re more represented in education. There are overwhelming majority of people who are educated. There are all these opportunities that have popped up. There’s these trends worldwide in favor of women. Maybe it has to do with technology, right, and how it affects men and women differently. I’m just trying to brainstorm ideas here.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I think the economic point, Daniel, I think that that’s really worth hammering on. The Politico had an article and Charles, you shared this with us offline from, I think, two days ago or yesterday, looking at this trend. And in some of the especially racial minority male voters that were interviewed as being sympathetic to Trump, the argument was, you know, I’m being told that I need to focus on this, on these aspects of feminism and diversity. And frankly, I really don’t care. I just want a job. And so I think there is something to that. And I mean, we saw, we don’t know how the current state of the economy will play politically, but at least at the height of the 2024 election, that’s even amongst racial minorities, like those voters, that’s kind of really what won the day and swung them heavily toward Trump.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: I think so, you know one other way to get at this is I mean I think you know part of if you’ve made fun at this I’ve made fun of this initiative is it seemed like It was so disinterested in just sort of like things that are obvious about what men as voters might want, like Renu is getting at, you know, what do black men want as voters? Well, they want jobs and they want the economy to not suck the same thing that many voters want at the margins. But I think this interesting question that I’m curious what people takes on is like what, you know, is there a way for the Democratic Party to sell itself to man? Like, I think a lot of people talked about Senator Ruben Gallego, who had some line about “every Latino man wants a big ass truck, and there’s nothing wrong with that.” And think this has become kind like a rallying cry for a certain like, the center left moderate wing of Democratic Party is like, yes, we need to be the party of big ass trucks. And I like think there’s, that’s not a terrible pitch. But so I’m curious, you know, what do you know?', 'Tal Fortgang: That’s not a euphemism for anything, is it?', 'Daniel Di Martino: But they hate cars though. So like the entire party hates cars and that’s like a very masculine thing too, cars. What’s one of the things that all teenage boys want? A car.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: But I think, like, okay, so, I mean, is there a way that is, is there a direction that they can go or they just sort of like, you know, we’re going to increasingly see this bifurcation. Like is, is it just, you know, optimal sorting means sorting on gender and we’re hosed?', 'Daniel Di Martino: Now, they need to moderate just for electoral reasons. Men will always be about half of the electorate. So they will lose elections, and then they will have to change those positions. I think it’s a matter of time.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I think, so I was very active on social media about this last night because Zohran Mamdani released an ad that was heavily targeted toward...', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Friend of the pod, Zohran Mamdani.', 'Renu Mukherjee: Yeah, friend of the pod. He loves us. Heavily targeted toward the South Asian community. People think that term doesn’t mean anything. I agree to some extent. So we’re talking Indians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Nepalese, et cetera, in New York City, areas like Jackson Heights. That ad, and me as a major critic of Mamdani, the reason I think that ad played well is because it’s not going to… There’s really no appeal to either gender. It’s just kind of showing him with men, with women. He’s drinking mango lassi. He’s making jokes. It’s it’s showing clips to Bollywood movies. A lot of the clips he shows are heavily masculine and macho, and I think that the Democrats will be able to appeal to men if they stop eating, sort of internally, each other alive. I mean if anyone appeals to men, but if they want sort of if they don’t want to heavily cultivate men or signal to men, I think they should watch mum Donnie’s ad where there’s not really any clear indication of gender, and he’s just kind of messaging in in general, and it’s just broadly appealing I think I really do think that’s the way to do it. Who knows if they’ll listen, but I think that might be one way for them to get around it if they’re uncomfortable with you know, like big trucks', 'Tal Fortgang: One avenue that I keep thinking about, and I’m sure the Democrats will hire some androgynous individuals to develop a new language. Democrats are always convinced that it’s just a PR problem, right? Like the policies are perfect. We just need to change the messaging and, you know, those stupid Americans will eventually figure out what’s good for them. But the truth is that there may actually be a kernel of truth here because Democrats’ language has become, I’d say feminized in a very therapeutic and frankly grating way. Someone recently brought up on social media, again, someone was talking about how often Democrats talk about “centering” and where did all this “centering” speak come from?', 'Daniel Di Martino: What is “centering” though?', 'Charles Fain Lehman: You got to center your voices. It’s an Occupy Wall Street thing, among other things. It filters up. It’s like you need to… It’s a way of saying like prioritize or focus or spotlight certain people, but it’s like you need to “center this voice.”', 'Daniel Di Martino: And they need to stand for black trans women, I bet. Of course. Of course.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Correct.', 'Tal Fortgang: Yeah, exactly, exactly. It’s like the same way that they use, that people on the political left use “uplift” to mean “amplify,” which is not what “uplift” means, but that’s fine. And there are a bunch of these, right? And I think that this stuff stems from therapy speak and the mass, the industrial scale of therapy, a hugely, frankly, an extremely feminine profession, a profession dominated by women and often geared towards women’s way of thinking. And we’ve seen this filter into K through 12 schools in a number of ways. My point is just that, like, just eliminating that, like, incredibly annoying and alienating way of speaking can probably start, like, making some progress on behalf of Democrats.', 'Daniel Di Martino: You’re so right, but the issue with that is you have seen the stats about like the share of people by ideology with a mental illness and how approximately half of young, extremely liberal people have a diagnosed mental illness, relative to like about 10 percent of the conservatives. And that I actually don’t think they’re mentally ill. I think they have made themselves mentally ill with the over therapy, over treatment, like everything is a problem.', 'You know, if I have, if I get nervous one day, that means I have chronic anxiety. So, and then you give yourself chronic anxiety and then you go to the therapist.', 'Tal Fortgang: Right, Daniel goes to the gym and lifts 500 pounds instead. That’s his therapy and that’s how he avoids a diagnosis. Good.', 'Daniel Di Martino: And I don’t need therapy, and that’s my therapy. Yes, exactly.', 'Daniel Di Martino: Talk to your friends, talk to your girlfriend, talk to your parents, go to the gym, eat well. That’s all you need.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I don’t have girlfriends. Sorry.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: We’re getting, no, we’re launching a spin off podcast. It’s Daniel Di Martino life advice. It’s like “don’t be a communist, lift heavy weights, be normal.”', 'Daniel Di Martino: Wow. Charles, you should launch that pod because you have all the PR. What are you talking about? That is language.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: All right, I want to take this out. So I want to actually ask a slightly different question than the one I told you I would have, but I’m going to throw this to you and tell you if you can answer it. One theme of this conversation has been Joe Rogan, and Joe Rogan as like, you know, the symbol of like Trump masculinity, like getting all those people to vote for Trump. And one topic of this conversation is, is there a democratic Joe Rogan? Which is funny because Joe Rogan was a Democrat, but is there, so that, that is my question.', 'Is there a Democratic Joe Rogan or can there be? Is there anybody you can think of who can bail them out of this problem?', 'Tricky one, I know.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I mean, I don’t watch that stuff, so...', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Okay.', 'Tal Fortgang: Joe Rogan in what sense? In the sense of being able to be edgy? In the sense of being funny and fit? I mean, there’s obviously all this discussion…', 'Charles Fain Lehman: In the sense of being able to project being one of the guys.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I mean, Newsom, as a political leader, I think he tries to display like the dominance portion, like I can own you and I can beat you to the Republicans and laugh at them. I do think, you know, he’s obviously liberal and he has all these things to appeal to all their interest groups and whatever, but I do think he has some of those characteristics as a politician. Now, outside of politicians, I’m not really sure because I’m like what, a podcaster?', 'Charles Fain Lehman: So my answer to your my own prompt is the guy that often comes to mind is Bill Maher, who’s an effective communicator, who has had relatively little time for all the feminization that you guys were talking about. Is there anyone else in that genre?', 'Daniel Di Martino: Sure.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I have… so I also actually think class comes into this because appealing to college educated males I think will be, and the democrats already do to some degree, but I think you know If they want to appeal to college educated males who are now bankers, big law attorneys that might not be as politically engaged, I think you know the Pod Save America bros, the Obama bros have a good model, but the reason I bring class into it is because they, you watch their podcasts or even when you listen, they use the same sort of phrases that Tal is alluding to, they’re very much pretty boys. That’s not going to allude to, you know, like a Latino plumber, for example. And so I don’t have a good example with respect to that. I think we should focus on the, they could amplify the Obama bros, but unfortunately, anytime the Obama bros say anything that’s remotely helpful for the Democratic Party, they get canceled and eaten alive.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: That’s true.', 'Daniel Di Martino: No, but that class role is good, Renu, because I think there is a path for the Democrats that is probably the most likely path that’s going to happen, and that is that they will choose to appeal only to college-educated men. And that may pay off, because with the fluctuations in education, with the fluctuations in the economy, whatever, Republicans don’t do very well in one election cycle, just increasing their share of college male votes, I mean, it’s credit for donations, they vote more often, it’s an increasing share of the population. It might not be a bad strategy, politically.', 'Tal Fortgang: This is a more complex question, I think, appears at first, because there so many layers to the Rogan phenomenon. And maybe I just need another cup of coffee to think about this. But the thing that springs to mind is just that Rogan symbolizes, the whole movement symbolizes a reliance on common sense, right? Like the kinds of things that allow you to say, like, that stuff is crazy in a way that I can’t quite articulate. And I don’t feel like I really need to, because we’re just like normal people who can laugh at the crazy, know, the overeducated experts and intellectuals who work themselves up into such a such a tizzy with their ridiculous ideas. And I’m not sure that the that the left is quite ready for just like straight up, you know, every man common sense. There’s a lot of work to do before you can like just unwind all the gender stuff that has been dominating the party for several years. Forget the Democratic Party. It’s a ticket to entry in polite society to accept certain shibboleths about the nature of gender and human nature more broadly. So without a real unwinding there, that’s a tough one.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: What Tal is saying is Democrats still need to do the work.', 'On that note, we’re going to be educated.', 'Tal Fortgang: Educate themselves. You got to educate yourself, Charles. Do better. Be better.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: So last night was the New York City mayoral debate. We’re not talking about it on this episode because we’re saving it for Monday. We have a very special all New York, all the time episode. Tune in. It’ll be great. But at the same time, New York Magazine did its regular rundown of who, which of the mayoral candidates rents, and which owns, and where they live, and what their houses are like. I learned that Curtis Sliwa has moved up from the shoebox he lived in the last time he was running for mayor, so we’re all very happy for Curtis. He has gone down from 15 cats to five cats, that’s great, good for them. Cuomo is renting, Eric Adams, nobody knows where he lives, maybe in New Jersey, it’s never been clear. But, the question for the panelists before we go, do you rent? Do you own? Which do you aspire to? I will not ask you to tell me how much you’re paying monthly, but I am curious how you think about that. Daniel, you’re in New York. You must rent.', 'Daniel Di Martino: I rent, yes. mean, I’m 26, come on. I’m 26 and unmarried. It doesn’t make sense to buy yet, but I obviously aspire to it. I’m saving for that. Yeah. Hopefully after being married, but yes.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Fair. Renu?', 'Renu Mukherjee: I rent. I live in D.C., but I will say I aspire to buy not necessarily with respect to my own homes, but with respect to properties as an investment strategy.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: You’re on the John Ketcham strategy.', 'Renu Mukherjee: Exactly. That’s where I learned.', 'Daniel Di Martino: Very South Asian of you, Renu.', 'Renu Mukherjee: I’m an Indian at the end of the day.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Tal, you guys must be renting.', 'Tal Fortgang: And I’m a Jew. Yes, and look, I live out West for the time being. You would not believe the rents we have where the air is clean and the humidity is low. I will say that we were recently considering buying a house as we look to move back to the East Coast. And I think that there’s nothing that I quite aspire to, like putting down roots in a place, buying a house and becoming part of a community. It’s a very, very profound thing. It’s also an enormous pain in the ass. So as the old man on the podcast, I’ll tell the youngins here, save up, dream big, and maybe someday you’ll be able to take out a mortgage on 12 percent interest like it’s the 1980s again.', 'Daniel Di Martino: Thanks, government.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Yeah, we also rent, you’re seeing my, live from my basement is where I do my podcasting. You know, some part of me shares Tal’s sort of romantic…', 'Tal Fortgang: Jewishness? Oh, okay.', 'Daniel Di Martino: It’s the American dream.', 'Charles Fain Lehman: Yeah, exactly, related. I know, but on the other hand, yeah, but it’s not obvious to me that it’s economically rational at this juncture.', 'That.is about all the time that we have. Thank you as always to our panelists.

Donald Trump’s travel ban: Why? And why now?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/5/donald-trumps-travel-ban-why-and-why-now,"['US administration says order aims to keep America safe, but advocates say ‘arbitrary’ ban will keep families apart.', 'Washington, DC – Donald Trump’s travel ban is the latest instalment in the United States president’s anti-immigration push, which plays to his right-wing base, advocates say, stressing that the order is not about public safety.', 'The decree, released late on Wednesday, bars and restricts travellers from 19 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.', 'While Trump has argued that the ban was put in place to protect the US from “foreign terrorists”, many believe the president has other motivations for implementing it.', '“The latest travel ban is absolutely part and parcel of the administration’s agenda to weaponise immigration laws to target people who are racial and religious minorities and people with whom they disagree,” said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president for US legal programmes at the International Refugee Assistance Project.', 'Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said that while the administration is presenting the ban as related to vetting travellers, the move aims to “placate” Trump’s supporters.', '“It’s the ‘tough on immigration’ stance that this administration has taken on a number of issues since coming into office,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.', 'Since his inauguration in January, the Trump administration has gutted the US refugee programme, aggressively stepped up deportations and targeted foreign students critical of Israel – in some cases, pushing to remove them from the country.', 'Immigration experts said they had been anticipating the travel ban since Trump signed an executive order in January that paved the way for it.', 'That order directed US officials to compile a list of nations “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.', 'Trump said in the statement announcing the ban that the targeted countries “remain deficient with regards to screening and vetting”.', '', '', '', 'This is not the first time Trump has ordered a travel ban. Wednesday’s order has several predecessors – multiple iterations of a ban that the US president imposed during his first term as president.', 'One week after taking office in 2017, Trump barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, an order that became widely known as the “Muslim ban”.', 'As a candidate in 2015, he called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”, and the 2017 proclamation appeared to be a reflection of that proposal.', 'However, there are key differences between the latest order and the one implemented in 2017, which sparked disorder and protests at airports and initially applied to legal permanent residents and people who already had visas.', 'Wednesday’s order lists specific exemptions, including for existing visa holders, who will still be able to come to the US using their visas, which will remain valid. Immediate relatives of US citizens will also be able to apply for and obtain visas.', 'Trump has also ordered it to go into effect on Monday – five days after the executive order was signed – whereas the original “Muslim ban” was implemented immediately and chaotically as soon as he announced it.', 'Moreover, the latest travel ban targets countries with people from different religious backgrounds across four continents, making it difficult to argue religious bias in any court challenge.', 'Also, the early bans of Trump’s first term were struck down by federal judges before the Supreme Court eventually upheld the third and last version his administration issued.', '“It seems like a lot more thought went into this, a lot more reasoning from their end,” Ayoub said. He added that in some ways, the ban is “not as bad” as the 2017 one and it will be difficult to challenge.', 'With the courts unlikely to block the order, Ayoub said he hopes the administration will issue more exemptions and work with the targeted countries to take steps that would remove them from the list.', '', '', '', 'Cooper said the impact of the ban will be devastating.', 'For example, the exemption on immediate relatives does not include the parents and children of permanent residents – people who have followed the rules and may have been waiting for years to get their immigration interviews to join their loved ones in the US.', '“There are still people on the cusp of reuniting with their families, on the cusp of arriving to safety in the United States who will be cut off from that family reunification and from that access to safety by this travel ban,” Cooper told Al Jazeera. “Families will be kept apart.”', 'The timing of Wednesday’s decree also differs from the original “Muslim ban”. It came more than five months into Trump’s second term.', 'Trump has tied the travel ban to an attack on Sunday that US authorities attributed to an Egyptian asylum seeker. They accused him of using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to injure 12 people who were protesting in Boulder, Colorado in support of Israeli captives held in Gaza.', 'However, Egypt is not on the list of banned countries, and when asked why not on Thursday, Trump told reporters that the country is a US ally that has “things under control”.', '“And why now? I can say that it can’t come soon enough, frankly,” Trump said.', '“We want to keep bad people out of our country. The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we are getting them out one by one.”', '', '', '', 'Cooper said the Trump administration is “exploiting the tragedy” in Colorado by rolling out the order in its aftermath.', '“Ultimately, if you look at the travel ban and the way that it operates, I am not convinced that this is a response to that,” she said.', '“But even if it were, even when there is a tragedy, even when something awful happens, punishing groups of people based on their nationality because of what one other person allegedly did is not the right answer.”', 'Cooper added that the order is “arbitrary”, noting that it includes exemptions for athletes competing in next year’s World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics but not for students.', 'Some Democrats have accused Trump of imposing the ban now to distract from his issues at home, including an enormous tax bill advancing through Congress and his feud with his former billionaire aide Elon Musk.', '“Anytime you ban people coming to the United States from other countries, it has a real impact,” Senator Chris Murphy told MSNBC.', '“But it is chiefly in service of trying to get us all talking about that … instead of talking about the centrepiece of this story, which is this bill to make the rich even richer at the expense of everybody else.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhNbWhyVUZRd1gxTkZZVGRNVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdhSlFaUnRKUWM=-w280-h168-p-df
Trump’s new travel ban: the countries chosen and how it differs from the last one,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/what-is-trump-travel-ban-countries,"['President’s sweeping proclamation targets citizens of many countries and would dramatically reshape US border policy', 'Nearly five months into his second term, Donald Trump has announced a new sweeping travel ban that could reshape the US’s borders more dramatically than any policy in modern memory. The restrictions, revealed through a presidential proclamation on Wednesday, would target citizens from more than a dozen countries – creating a three-tiered system of escalating barriers to entry.', 'The proclamation represents one of the most ambitious attempts to reshape the US’s approach to global mobility in modern history and potentially affects millions of people coming to the US for relocation, travel, work or school.', 'A travel ban restricts or prohibits citizens of specific countries from entering the US. These restrictions can range from complete visa suspensions to specific limitations on certain visa categories.', 'Trump’s day one executive order required the state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.', 'His travel ban proclamation referenced the previous executive order, as well as the recent attack by an Egyptian national in Boulder, Colorado, upon a group of people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.', 'A presidential proclamation is a decree that is often ceremonial or can have legal implications when it comes to national emergencies.', 'Unlike an executive order, which is a directive to heads of agencies in the administration, the proclamation primarily signals a broad change in policy.', 'The following countries were identified for total bans of any nationals seeking to travel to the US for immigration or non-immigration reasons:', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'Republic of the Congo', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Trump is also partly restricting the travel of people from:', 'Burundi', 'Cuba', 'Laos', 'Sierra Leone', 'Togo', 'Turkmenistan', 'Venezuela', 'The proclamation broadly cites national security issues for including the countries, but specifies a few different issues that reach the level of concern for the travel ban.', 'For some countries, such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Venezuela, the proclamation claims that there is no reliable central authority for issuing passports or screening and vetting nationals traveling out of the country.', 'For other countries, such as Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan, the proclamation cites a high rate of immigrants overstaying their business, tourist and student visas in the US.', 'Finally, there are several countries that are included because of terrorist activity or state-sponsored terrorism, including Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and Cuba.', 'In the draft travel ban plans that were leaked in March, the original list contained 43 nations across three tiers of restrictions. Now the ban has been filtered down to 19 countries.', 'Among the puzzling inclusions is Venezuela, which the White House says lacks competent document-issuing authorities. Trump has recently pursued a thaw in relations with the country that has proven useful to his deportation initiatives– though the country’s inclusion is likely tied to Venezuelans already in the US who have been a clear target for the White House.', 'The 2017 ban initially targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries before expanding to include North Korea and Venezuela. This new proclamation is broader and also makes the notable addition of Haiti.', 'During his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump amplified false claims made by his running mate, JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the pets of the people that live there”. The proclamation falsely claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration” and this “influx harms American communities”. In fact, about 200,000 Haitians were granted temporary protected status, which gives legal residency permits to foreign nationals who are unable to return home safely due to conditions in their home countries.', 'Also notable are the restrictions on Afghans, given that many of the Afghans approved to live in the US as refugees were forced to flee their home country as a result of working to support US troops there, before the full withdrawal of US forces in 2021. The agreement with the Taliban to withdraw US troops was negotiated by Trump during his first term.', 'Last month, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced “the termination of temporary protected status for Afghanistan”, effective 20 May.', 'The restrictions will be reviewed every 180 days for potential modification.', 'Current visa holders remain largely protected: the restrictions only apply to people outside the US without valid visas as of 9 June. No existing visas will be revoked, the White House said.', 'But new visa applications from people from these countries will be suspended or severely limited, with some exceptions for diplomatic visas, immediate family members and cases involving US national interest – one such example being the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.', 'For employers, the ban threatens significant workforce disruptions across the tech, healthcare and education sectors, with companies unable to hire from the 12 countries targeted by a full ban. For the seven countries on a partial ban, employers can still hire on some work visas but cannot sponsor green cards, and visas will have reduced durations.', 'The impact could be particularly severe for international Stem talent, medical professionals and academic recruitment.', 'The education and health industries alone employ about 5.5 million foreign-born workers.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhNbWhyVUZRd1gxTkZZVGRNVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdhSlFaUnRKUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

The list of those countries with full travel bans includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, a list that could have impacted teams competing at both the Club World Cup and Gold Cup.

Travelers from seven other countries — Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela — will deal with a partial restriction. ""These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants,"" the proclamation reads in part.', 'The new travel restrictions will begin on Monday and are not expected to impact those with visas issued beforehand or green card holders.', 'The proclamation lists several exemptions for the ban, including athletes and staff traveling to the U.S. for major sporting events. The World Cup and Olympics were name-dropped specifically, but a spokesperson for the White House said the Club World Cup and Gold Cup are amongst the events that the exemption applies to.', ""Haiti's men's national team will take part in the Gold Cup this summer, while several players at the Club World Cup hail from nations that were listed in the proclamation.

The U.S. generally plays host to preseason friendlies from visiting teams each summer, while MLS welcomes Liga MX counterparts for the Leagues Cup annually.', ""Even before the proclamation, a handful of players were advised not to leave the U.S. because of travel concerns during the second Trump administration.

What exactly is Trump’s new travel ban about?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.', 'Any reasonable American could objectively ask what exactly President Donald Trump’s new travel ban, which affects a dozen countries, is about.', 'Is it about protecting Americans from “murderers,” as Trump said Thursday, or punishing small countries for a modest number of students who overstayed their visas?', 'The drive for Trump’s first-term travel ban in 2017 and 2018 was clear.', 'He was seeking to deliver on an ugly campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the US. That morphed, over the course of years as the administration adapted to court cases, into a ban on travel to the US by people from certain countries, most of which were majority-Muslim.', 'It was only by agreeing to ignore Trump’s anti-Muslim 2016 campaign statements and focus solely on the security-related language in his third attempt at a travel ban that the US Supreme Court ultimately gave its blessing to that ban.', '“… We must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion.', 'Trump is using that authority again in his second term.', 'But this time, as he said Thursday in the Oval Office, the ban is about removing “horrendous” people who are in the country now and about keeping murderers out.', 'The data suggest the travel ban will primarily affect students and businesspeople from countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean as well as the Middle East.', 'It was an attack on Jewish community members in Colorado by an Egyptian national that convinced Trump to speed up plans to ban people from a dozen countries from entering the US, restarting the travel ban policy he pioneered during his first term.', 'But Egypt is not on the travel ban list.', 'Neither is Kuwait, the country where Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack, lived before coming to the US.', '“Egypt has been a country we deal with very closely. They have things under control,” Trump told reporters Thursday.', 'Instead, the travel ban includes countries that Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who assembled the list, feel don’t have things under control.', 'That includes places like Equatorial Guinea in Africa and Burma, also known as Myanmar, in Asia. Neither is a nexus of terror threatening the American homeland.', 'Trump’s order announcing the travel ban explains that these countries have high rates of students and other travelers overstaying their visas in the US.', 'It points to a report of DHS “overstay” data from 2023 to argue that for more than 70% of people from Equatorial Guinea with US student visas, there is no record of them leaving the US when their visa ended.', 'In real numbers, that equals 233 people with student visas. The numbers are similarly small for other African countries.', '“They’re just throwing things at the wall,” said David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato institute and a Trump immigration policy critic.', '“There’s not really a coherent philosophy behind any of this,” Bier added.', 'The reinstated travel ban does include countries associated with terrorism, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, all of which were also included in Trump’s first-term travel ban. But it’s worth noting that no immigrant or traveler from one of these countries has launched a terror attack on the US in recent years, according to a review by the Washington Post during Trump’s first term. A man from Sudan killed one person at a Tennessee church in 2017.', '“The president claims that there is no way to vet these nationals, yet that is exactly what his consular officers and border officials have successfully done for decades,” Bier said.', 'The man responsible for the ISIS-inspired truck bomb in New Orleans in January, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was a Texas-born Army veteran and US citizen.', 'The new travel ban also includes Afghanistan, which could jeopardize many Afghans related to those who aided the US during its war there, as Shawn VanDiver, president of the aid organization #AfghanEvac, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Thursday.', '“There are 12,000 people who have been separated through the actions of our government, who have been waiting for more than three and a half years,” he said.', 'The Trump administration recently paused the processing of student visas, interrupting the plans of thousands of people to study in the US.', 'In the Oval Office, Trump said he was not interested in banning students from China.', '“It’s our honor to have them, frankly, we want to have foreign students, but we want them to be checked,” Trump said, suggesting there will be even more strenuous background checks in the future.', 'The existence of the travel ban list could also factor into tariff negotiations the Trump administration has taken on with nations across the world, as well as its effort to countries nations to take back migrants it wants to deport.', '“It’s about power and control and manipulating both the US population to suppress dissent as well as trying to manipulate foreign relations with these countries by getting them to do whatever he wants in order to get off the disfavored nation list,” Bier said.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

"Trump's new ban dodges pitfalls faced by last attempt, experts say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7gp8l1241o,"['US President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping new travel ban for people from 12 countries, revisiting a hallmark policy of his first term in office.', 'There are some key differences, however.', 'The original travel ban suffered a series of legal defeats. This time, the policy appears to have been designed to avoid the same pitfalls.', 'Its predecessor, which targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries and was dubbed the ""Muslim ban"" by critics, was ordered just a week after Trump took office in 2017, during his first term in the White House.', 'The ban was amended twice to overcome court challenges, after opponents argued it was unconstitutional and illegal because it discriminated against travellers based on their religion.', 'A scaled-back version was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018, which this new ban closely resembles.', 'Legal experts told the BBC that it appeared Trump had learned lessons from his first attempt.', 'Christi Jackson, an expert in US immigration law at the London firm Laura Devine Immigration, said the new ban was more legally robust as a result.', 'While the first lacked ""clarity"", the new restrictions were ""wider in scope"" and had ""clearly defined"" exemptions, she said.', 'While there are some similarities in the nations chosen by the 2017 ban and the 2025 ban, Muslim-majority states are not the express target of the latest order.', ""Barbara McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan and former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that, on this basis, it seemed likely to win the approval of the Supreme Court if it was ever referred up to that level."", 'The 12 countries subject to the harshest restrictions from 9 June are mainly in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean, including Afghanistan, Iran and Somalia.', 'There will be partial restrictions on travellers from another seven countries, including Cuban and Venezuelan nationals.', 'Trump said the strength of the restrictions would be graded against the severity of the perceived threat, including from terrorism.', ""But besides Iran, none of the 12 countries hit by the outright ban are named on the US government's state sponsors of terrorism list."", ""Trump cited Sunday's incident in Boulder, Colorado, in which a man was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at demonstrators attending a march for Israeli hostages, in a video announcing the ban on X."", 'The alleged attacker was an Egyptian national. However, Egypt does not appear on either list.', 'Trump also specified high rates of people overstaying their visas as a reason for listing certain countries.', 'However, Steven D Heller, an immigration lawyer based in the US, said there was a ""lack of clarity"" over what threshold had to be met by a country\'s overstaying rate in order for that country to be placed on Trump\'s ban list. That could be the basis for a successful legal challenge, he suggested.', '""If they\'re relying on this notion of excessive overstay rates... they have to define what that actually means,"" he told the BBC.', 'But he noted that existing US law gave the president broad powers over immigration policy.', ""Unlike the first ban, which was to last for only 90 to 120 days, today's order has no end date."", 'It has been met with dismay in the targeted countries.', 'Venezuela has described the Trump administration as ""supremacists who think they own the world"", though Somalia has pledged to ""engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised"".', 'The original ban spurred mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports.', 'It was repealed in 2021 by Trump\'s successor, President Joe Biden, who called the policy ""a stain on our national conscience"".', 'Immigration lawyer Shabnam Lotfi, who challenged the previous travel ban, said it would be an ""uphill battle"" to overturn the new one.', '""The president does have the authority to determine who is admissible to the US,"" she said, adding that because of the way the ban had been written, it was ""harder to find a huge group of people that could file a class-action lawsuit"".', '""They\'ve put more thought into it.""', 'Ms Lotfi noted that the new restrictions could have consequences for students and other visa applicants abroad.', '""Students who are stuck in administrative processing are impacted. So are winners of the diversity visa lottery who paid fees and went to interviews - they\'re unlikely to get visas now,"" she said.', '""Even EB-5 investors - people who\'ve put over $1 million into the US economy - are affected. And H-1B visa holders stuck abroad, waiting to return to their US employers, could also be blocked.""', 'Additional reporting by Leyla Khodabakhshi', 'Travis Decker is believed to be using his outdoor survival skills to hide in a remote part of Washington state.', 'The service will be run by the French airline, Finistair, from June to August.', 'The county council wants to make walking and cycling easier and safer across the riverside town.', 'Maggie\'s says people are ""frequently"" being refused cover or quoted unaffordable insurance costs.', 'Volker Turk\'s intervention comes after the US sanctioned four judges over ""illegitimate"" targeting of Israel and the US.', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

Who is exempt?', 'The travel ban includes Haiti, which has a significant Haitian population in Charleroi, Washington County.', 'Sierra Leone is among the countries facing partial restrictions as well. Augusta Goll, a Sierra Leonean immigrant and owner of Queen’s Market in Charleroi, expressed disappointment in Trump’s actions after supporting him.', ""“We have this hope in him that he's going to do way better than she, you know? But since he's been here, it's just dividing families. It's just making everybody sad. America is built on immigration. Let's be honest. His wife is an immigrant. These are the same opportunities everybody's looking for,” she said."", 'Goll, whose family remains in Sierra Leone, reflected on the impact of the new restrictions.', ""“My father is still in Sierra Leone. I have brothers and sisters. I have a lot of relatives. They are all in Sierra Leone, and to know that they're not going to be able to come to this beautiful country is really, really, really sad,” she said."", 'While Goll acknowledged the issue of overstayed visas, she questioned the approach.', '“Blocking people not to come to America, making America great again, please. That’s not what America should stand for. America stands for open hands to welcome all types of people, as long as you come legally, you fill out a proper document, you pay the proper amount, you go through the security that is required to enter to this country. Let it be,"" Goll said.', 'Immigration attorney Joseph Murphy highlighted the broader implications of the travel ban, discussing its effects on families, commerce, and tourism.', '“There’s people that have family in these countries that want to visit loved ones here, maybe sick, maybe for funerals, maybe for college graduations. There’s any number of life events, studying opportunities, and then there’s commerce. Some of these countries we don’t do a lot of commerce with, but there is commerce. There’s business that goes on between these countries. Tourism, at a minimum, that will be an economic loss,” Murphy said.', 'Murphy also warned about international repercussions stemming from the policy.', '“When the United States starts doing things like this and the other countries will do reciprocal things, it’s just like the tariff war. ‘All right, you’re not going to take our people. We’re not going to take yours.’ And you can get yourself into something childish. Again, the mathematics has to have been done, and at least in the reasoning of the Trump administration, they probably believe that there’s not a lot of people from here traveling to Somalia and that it’s a fair enough trade for them,” he said.', 'The ban is set to take effect Monday.', 'Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXhNbWhyVUZRd1gxTkZZVGRNVFJDMkFoalJBeWdLTWdhSlFaUnRKUWM=-w280-h168-p-df
