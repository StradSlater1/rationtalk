Teen Mom Star Kailyn Lowry’s Son Comes Out as Gay,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/teen-mom-star-kailyn-lowry-201332939.html,"['Pride Month is extra exciting this year for Teen Mom star Kailyn Lowry. Her 15-year-old son came out as gay in an emotional new episode of her podcast, Barely Famous. For those of us who watched this kid come into the world on 16 & Pregnant, you can’t help but feel touched (and a little old) by this news.', 'When we first met Elliot on MTV, his mom named him Isaac. During the June 5 episode of his mom’s podcast, he opened up about his identity and shared that he’d preferred to be called by Elliot, his middle name.', '“I started going by Elliott, because at some point, I wasn’t happy with my first name,” he said on the podcast. “It just doesn’t feel like me.”', 'His announcement wasn’t just about his preferred name. Elliot told his mom and everyone listening at home that he’s gay. He said was ready to show the world “who I am, not who you saw on TV.”', 'The best part about all of this is just how supportive his mom was throughout the episode. We all know how LGBTQ people around the world are ostracized by their families for being themselves. Kailyn made it clear that she’s not that type of mom and threw her full support behind Elliot. At one point, she got choked up with happy tears.', '“I’m crying because this shows your strength, and I’m just really proud of you. It’s a really brave thing to do,” Kailyn said.', 'And before you try to judge Kailyn for dedicating an episode of her podcast to her son’s coming out, she shared in a follow-up Instagram post that all of the proceeds from the episode, and the bonus content on Patreon, will go straight to him. She’s just a proud mom with a proud, gay son.', 'Teen Mom is streaming on Paramount+.', 'TELL US – ARE YOU PROUD OF ELLIOT FOR LIVING IN HIS TRUTH? DO YOU HAVE ANY WORDS OF SUPPORT FOR KAILYN AND HER SON?', 'The post Teen Mom Star Kailyn Lowry’s Son Comes Out as Gay appeared first on Reality Tea.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNHhZVkIyWmpCcFdFSkpSak41VFJDM0FSaVRBaWdCTWdrTlFaTFRxS2V4aGdJ=-w280-h168-p-df

But if you don’t, then just be yourself. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Just be who you are.”', 'Fans met Lowry, 33, in 2010 when she appeared on an episode of 16 and Pregnant.

I would have been fine if you kept calling me Isaac because I know that transition would have been hard and it was a bit because you called me by my first name my whole life. I think the separation from my personal and private life or who I was on TV vs. who I am now, that was the main reason but at some point, I just realized I liked my middle name better.”', 'Ultimately, Elliott is grateful to have the opportunity to share his true, authentic self with people he trusts. He hopes his story will inspire others to feel less alone.', '“Happy pride everybody!” he shared. “I’m here today to show you who I am — not who you saw on TV for 12 years of my life. It’s very important to me because I feel like growing up on TV, it’s hard to show who you really are when a camera is in front of you all the time.

But Creed, he's four, he started calling you Elliott, and it's so funny. He's like, ‘Who my brother Elliott?’ And I'm like, how easy was that for him.”"", 'But Kailyn couldn’t be happier for her son and his decision.', ""“I can appreciate the separation between who you were and who you are today,” the 33-year-old added. “I think that that is cool for you to recognize.

""We’ve come a long way since we were 18,"" Kailyn wrote on X after attending Jo and now-wife Vee Rivera\'s 2018 wedding. ""I couldn’t ask for a better stepmom."" ', 'As for her oldest son, ""We have literally grown up together, but in some ways he’s even more grown than I am,"" she wrote in an Instagram tribute on his 13th birthday. Describing the devoted Olivia Rodrigo fan, musician and basketball player as ""thoughtful, brilliant, funny and at times a smartass,"" the Delaware State grad praised his caring heart. ', '""I think what really inspires me about him is the way he challenges social norms,"" she wrote. ""Because he is curious and open-minded, he can form his own thoughts and opinions."" ', 'Elliott, who announced his intentions to go by his middle name on his mom\'s Barely Famous podcast in June 2025, while also coming out as gay, ""accepts people for who they are and never how they’re \'supposed\' to be,"" Kailyn wrote. ""More people should be like him.""', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln Marshall Marroquin joined the squad on Nov. 16, 2013, roughly a year after the then-star of Teen Mom 2 wed his father Javi Marroquin. ', '""Very much into sports,"" as Kailyn described the tween in a 2022 episode of her Barely Famous podcast, he spends a significant portion of his time bouncing between basketball and football games. He even had an NBA-themed bash for his 10th birthday, with a nod to his favorite player, Allen Iverson.', 'No surprise, then, that he provided an assist when it came time to think up a name for his youngest brother. ""Verse came from Iverson, which is the name that Lincoln recommended,"" Kailyn revealed in a February 2024 TikTok. ""Obviously, it would be on his list because he\'s a huge basketball fan.""', 'And an all-star sibling. ""To know Lincoln is to love him,"" she wrote in a 2022 birthday tribute. ""Dedicated, smart, handsome and the best brother out there.""', 'Lux', ""Football, wrestling, Rubik's Cubes and Michael Jackson—these are a few of Lux Russell Lowry's favorite things. "", 'Kailyn\'s first child with ex-boyfriend Chris Lopez, Lux was born on Aug. 5, 2017. Though she and Chris would continue their on-and-off romance for several years, ""Right now, we don\'t communicate at all,"" she revealed to E! News in 2020. ""I\'m hoping that it will get better with time but I don\'t have a big vision. I don\'t have anything negative to say. I hope for our kids that everything works itself out in whatever direction that may be."" ', 'And whichever way Lux heads, he\'s getting there fast. ""Lux came into this world at lightning speed & has kept us on our toes every single day since,"" Kailyn wrote while celebrating his sixth birthday with a WWE-themed bash. ""I love this little leo baby so much!""', 'Creed', 'Ahead of Creed Romello Lowry-Lopez\'s July 30, 2020 arrival, Kailyn admitted to wrestling with a huge decision. ""I hid the pregnancy for so long just because I didn\'t know what I was going to do—if I was going to keep the baby or not,"" she explained to E! News shortly after his birth. ""That was really heavy for me and I really, really was struggling during that time.""', ""Though her relationship with Creed's dad Chris was notably rocky, one glance at his ultrasound sealed her decision."", 'Much like his older siblings—""All three of them have asked to hold the baby and they\'re super loving on him,"" Kailyn told E!—the podcaster was smitten from day one. ', '""CREED. Romello. Mello. Romey. Rome. Biggie. Bigs,"" she wrote on his third birthday, a joint WWE fete with Lux. ""No words could accurately describe my love for this little firecracker so I’ll save the sap for real life!""', 'Rio', '""I wanted to be able to tell my own story on my own terms,"" Kailyn explained to People of keeping news of her fifth son Rio private until well after his November 2022 birth. ', 'Though she acknowledged he ""had a little bit of a traumatic entrance into this world where he went to the NICU,"" due to breathing issues and fluid in his lungs, he\'s been ""the best baby ever."" ', 'First-time dad Elijah Scott deserves some props as well. ""It\'s been very different from my other partners and my kids\' other dads,"" she said of her fiancé. ""He pours concrete, he gets down and dirty at work. But he\'s also just a real family man. He\'s very, very much connected with his own family, with our family, and so he\'s been a really good partner to me, and I feel like it\'s a really good match.""', 'Which is perhaps why her first few months with Rio inspired her to keep the party going. ""Honestly, being a mom to four was harder than five, but I think that was because my number four is so spicy,” Kaily revealed. “Number five is fantastic. He\'s the world\'s greatest baby like, if all my babies were like this, I\'d have 10 more.”', 'Cut to...', 'Verse and Valley', 'Kailyn finally entered her girl mom era in late October 2023 with the arrival of Verse and Valley, her second and third children with boyfriend Elijah. ', ""Valley (named for Kailyn's childhood growing up in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley), endured a longer NICU stay than her brother as she worked through some feeding issues. "", '""I had never seen a baby in my life not wake up to eat or show signs of hunger,"" Kailyn explained on a January 2024 episode of Barely Famous. ""She would just sleep through feedings. She never had any feeding cues and when I tried to feed her, she wouldn\'t take a bottle."" ', 'And though Kailyn continues to worry about the twins\' bond after their extended separation (""I\'m trying to re-magnetize them to get them back to where they were"") she\'s thrilled that her family is finally whole. ', '""I feel grateful, thankful, fulfilled, happy, complete,"" she noted. ""We\'re putting an addition on our house because of this. I feel so blessed.
