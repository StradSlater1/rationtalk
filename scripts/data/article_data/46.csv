""That\'s one of our strengths is the depth of the group from the front end to the back end to the goaltending.""', 'At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky earned the ""Bobby!

Why the Florida Panthers will win the Stanley Cup (again),https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/45438620/nhl-2025-playoffs-stanley-cup-final-why-panthers-win-again-oilers,"['', 'I want to see Connor McDavid raise the Stanley Cup.', 'I want to see all that regular-season hardware -- five scoring titles, three Hart trophies as league MVP, the four-time NHLPA most outstanding player -- metaphorically traded for a Stanley Cup ring, like when you turn in smaller prizes for a larger one during a carnival game. I want him rewarded for his 10 years of trying to will the Edmonton Oilers to their first Stanley Cup since 1990. Those fans deserve another party, with McDavid as the master of ceremonies.', ""I want to see him permanently overwrite those images of himself as an empty husk after Game 7 last season, his soul seemingly drained from his body by a series so emotionally erratic that he was voted the playoffs' most valuable player moments after losing in the championship finale."", 'I want to see the laziest counterargument to McDavid\'s status as a hockey deity -- that he ""never won the Cup"" -- rendered immaterial, as it eventually was for players such as Alex Ovechkin and Nathan MacKinnon. I want that cathartic scream when he picks up the chalice for the first time. The king deserves his crowning moment.', ""Unfortunately, what I want and what the Florida Panthers are willing to give McDavid aren't at all aligned. They deprived him of his Stanley Cup win last season. They've going to do it again in this Stanley Cup Final rematch, despite the sportsbooks and the majority of pundits believing that it's McDavid's moment."", 'Here are five reasons the Panthers are likely headed for a repeat:', ""It's undeniable that the Oilers are a better team than they were last season."", ""Edmonton's roster is deeper and more cohesive than the 2024 Western Conference champions. They're scoring more (4.06 goals per game) than last season. Their 5-on-5 defense is remarkably better: 1.89 goals per 60 minutes, down from 2.55 last postseason."", ""Perhaps the most impressive part of the Oilers' defensive game has been the ability to close out games -- witness their shot suppression in the last three wins over the Dallas Stars. They were a minus-6 in the third period last postseason; they're a plus-11 this season through 16 games. The only downgrade year-over-year is their penalty kill, which has given up 16 goals in 16 games while it gave up four in 25 games last season. One assumes the return of Mattias Ekholm will help."", 'But the Panthers are also better.', 'Like, a lot better. Which is scary.', '', ""Download the ESPN app and enable Emily Kaplan's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here."", ""Florida is a plus-27 in goal differential through 17 games, after finishing at a plus-11 last season. The Panthers are scoring more (3.88) and giving up less (2.29). At 5-on-5, they've gone from 2.39 goals per 60 minutes last season to 3.53 goals per 60 this season. Their power play is up year over year -- something to keep in mind if the Oilers keep struggling on the PK -- and the penalty kill is about the same."", 'They also upgraded in a few roster spots during the season, primarily with the additions of Seth Jones to their second defense pairing and Brad Marchand to their third line.', ""Last season, Florida paired Niko Mikkola with Brandon Montour, a good puck-moving defenseman who parlayed his success with Florida into a free agent deal with the Seattle Kraken. The Panthers registered 49% of the shot attempts and averaged 1.84 goals for and 2.03 goals against per 60 minutes when that pair was on the ice. Mikkola's pairing with Jones is a marked upgrade: 56% of the shot attempts, 4.14 goals for and 1.69 goals against per 60 minutes at 5-on-5. The duo has an expected goals against of 1.48 per 60 minutes -- Montour and Mikkola were at 2.37 last postseason."", 'That\'s not just the addition of Jones to the Panthers\' top four. Mikkola has leveled up into something special, defending better and flashing a surprising amount of offensive speed for a 6-foot-6 defender nicknamed ""The Condor.""', '""Meeks has been a beast. All playoffs, he\'s everywhere,"" Marchand said. ""I don\'t think he gets enough credit. He\'s extremely tough to play against. Then when you play with him, and you realize that he\'s not flashy, but he closes so quick, he\'s always on top of guys and he\'s physical.""', ""The addition of Marchand has also made the Panthers a more dangerous team than last season -- and not only in terms of what's said on the ice during games. The third line of their Cup-winning team was anchored by center Anton Lundell and winger Eetu Luostarinen, a solid duo that skated with a variety of wingers. Putting Marchand with those two after acquiring him at the trade deadline from Boston improved the team in several ways."", 'Marchand, Lundell and Luostarinen have earned 53% of the shot attempts at 5-on-5. They average 4.2 goals and 0.82 goals against per 60 minutes. Marchand has 14 points in 17 games. Luostarinen has 13 points in 17 games. Lundell has five goals and seven assists, and continues to give this team preposterous center depth as sort of a ""Baby Barkov"" for the Panthers.', ""By solidifying that line with Marchand, it allows the Panthers to keep their top six solidified. One duo is Aleksander Barkov and Sam Reinhart. The other duo is Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk. They shuttle Carter Verhaeghe, one of the playoffs' most clutch scorers, and Evan Rodrigues, an analytics darling, between those lines on the wing. Both combinations have yielded results for Florida."", ""But beyond what's happening on the ice -- or perhaps as a catalyst for it -- the Panthers are playing with the poise and confidence of a champion, fortified by a proof of concept that comes only after a Stanley Cup skate."", 'These two goalies have had similar postseason journeys: Inconsistent and middling results early in the playoffs, followed by dominant runs that began in the middle of the second round and carried through to the Stanley Cup Final.', '""Middling"" is probably putting it kindly for Skinner\'s playoffs, where he was benched in the first round and got back into the playoffs only when Calvin Pickard was injured against the Vegas Golden Knights. But from Game 4 against Vegas to the Cup Final, he\'s been scorching hot: 6-1, .944 save percentage, 1.41 goals-against average and three shutouts.', 'Stuart Skinner makes a beautiful stick save to keep the game tied 2-2 for the Oilers vs. the Golden Knights.', ""Bobrovsky wasn't all that great early either until a Game 4 shutout against the Maple Leafs. After that, he went 7-2 with a .944 save percentage, a 1.34 goals-against average and two shutouts."", 'The Florida netminder had a chaotic Stanley Cup Final last season, but ended it with a 23-save effort at home in Game 7 to clinch the Cup. It was the kind of game that reinforced the ""Playoff Bob"" legend that the Oilers will no doubt hear about again this season.', 'Averaged out, Skinner and Bobrovsky were both at replacement levels for the totality of the playoffs according to Stathletes. Over their past five games, Bobrovsky (2.35 goals saved above expected) has been better analytically than Skinner (1.89).', 'Skinner is playing well enough where he shouldn\'t lose this series for Edmonton, which is really all they can ask from him and Pickard. But Bobrovsky, assuming he\'s in ""Playoff Bob"" mode, can win this series for Florida. That\'s the difference.', ""The most significant change year-over-year between these teams is that the Oilers have home-ice advantage this time. Unfortunately, that might play into the Panthers' hands."", ""Florida is 8-2 on the road, which is tied for the sixth-best winning percentage in NHL postseason history (minimum eight road games). Their 4.80 goals per game would make them the highest-scoring road playoff team in Stanley Cup history (again, minimum eight road games). That plus-27 goal differential in the postseason? It has all come on the road, where they've scored 48 times and given up 21 goals. They're even (18 for and 18 against) at home."", '""It\'s us against the world. That kind of feeling,"" defenseman Gustav Forsling said.', ""There are two clear reasons for the Panthers' road dominance. The first is that Florida is at its absolute best when it trims the flourish out of its offensive game to become a blunt instrument."", '""Our mindset is just play as simple as we can,"" Verhaeghe said. ""Get the puck deep, get on their defense and forecheck, which is our strength.""', 'The other reason: The Panthers absolutely love to suck the energy out of a road arena and send the opposing fans home feeling miserable.', '""It\'s fun when you\'re on the road and it goes quiet. It feels like we\'re doing our job,"" Verhaeghe said.', ""Joe Fortenbaugh explains why he's taking the Panthers to repeat as champions against the Oilers."", 'Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl can exert their will on a period, a game and a series. McDavid is coming off a series against Dallas in which he had nine points in five games, for example.', 'Florida has one of those guys, too. Barkov doesn\'t get mentioned with the same breathless praise as the Oilers\' duo or Auston Matthews or Nathan MacKinnon or Sidney Crosby. He has broken 90 points only once in his career, although his points-per-game rate between 2017-25 (1.11) ranks him 12th among all skaters, right between Crosby and Cale Makar. He\'s not the most vocal guy, nor does he have the most boisterous personality -- Panthers coach Paul Maurice joked that Barkov is ""not doing a podcast when he\'s done [playing].""', ""All of those players mentioned are Hart Trophy guys. Barkov is a Selke Trophy guy, having been named as the NHL's best defensive forward for the third time in his career this week. You can't be both. Since the best defensive forward award was first handed out in 1977-78, only two players have ever won a Hart and a Selke at some point in their careers: Sergei Fedorov and Bobby Clarke. As of this season, the highest Barkov ever placed for MVP was sixth in 2020-21."", ""But he's just as much of a game changer and series shifter as any other superstar, only his ability to do so sometimes starts in the defensive zone. Against Edmonton last postseason, the Panthers outscored the Oilers 5-2 with Barkov on the ice during those seven games, earning the majority of the shot attempts and scoring chances."", 'He can create something out of nothing with his puck control and large frame.', 'Witness the series clincher against Carolina:', 'Carter Verhaeghe fires home a big-time goal to give the Panthers a lead late in the third period.', 'Rodrigues said that goal ""speaks to who [Barkov] is as a person"" after Game 5.', '""He\'s so even-keeled,"" Rodrigues said. ""Doesn\'t get too high, doesn\'t get too low, and just when games get intense and very emotional, he\'s able to play his game and just do the right things over and over again.""', 'Which brings us to perhaps the most salient point in this prediction.', ""This might be hyperbolic but that's never stopped me before: I think the Panthers are basically built to be an Oilers countermeasure."", ""They can score with the Oilers. They can defend as good as any team in the NHL. They have impactful star players and effective role players. They're unfazed by chaotic road environments. They're well-coached. They play with a physicality, swagger and antagonism. They can dish it out and take it and then dish it out again."", ""But they also have that special trait shared with other great NHL champions, which is that they're willing to win on their terms or on whatever terms the opponents will set for them."", ""Think about the Western Conference finals. Think about how the Dallas Stars felt like they had toppled into an abyss when the Oilers would score the first goal. Think about how they could send only four shots on Skinner in the third period of must-win games, frustrated to no end that they couldn't play their game."", ""The Panthers don't get flustered. They don't lose their confidence or have their hope extinguished if things aren't to their liking. They maximize the opportunities they earn. They're meticulous and patient where others are harried and panicked."", 'Carolina was a stingy defensive team. The Panthers waited for their chances to pounce, and when they did, the games changed dramatically. In each of their wins over the Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals, the Panthers scored multiple goals within four minutes of each other. Florida is the most ""blood in the water"" team in the NHL. In Game 3, it was five goals in 9:08. In Game 5, it was three goals in 4:36.', '""We go into the game, we know exactly what we need to do,"" Barkov said. ""The confidence level is high and everyone\'s having fun right now.""', 'The Florida Panthers win 5-3 in a back-and-forth Game 5 battle vs. the Hurricanes to advance to their third consecutive Stanley Cup Final.', 'GM Bill Zito and his staff have constructed a Stanley Cup champion whose core players have the postseason competence and drive that other teams desperately try to import into their lineups at the deadline every season. The Panthers don\'t need an infusion of ""rings in the room."" They almost all have them now. Playoff self-assurance is a nucleotide in their hockey DNA.', 'Their ""win at all costs"" style has earned them detractors, but it has also earned them three consecutive trips to the Stanley Cup Final.', ""Based on the Panthers' recent play and their advantages in this matchup, it'll also earn them a second straight skate with Stanley."", ""And if I'm wrong, then Connor McDavid has his championship moment. Which would be awesome, too.""]",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHpjMUZNUXpoc05rdHNTVE0xVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Now, all that’s left is to hop on a plane to Edmonton to get set for Game 1 at Rogers Place on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET; CBC, TVAS, SN, TNT, truTV, MAX).', '“Ready to go, for sure,” captain Aleksander Barkov said Monday. “We’ve been waiting for a little bit here. Obviously, it was nice to get a couple days off, stay in Florida for a little bit, not to think about anything, but now it starts to feel like, alright, let’s get it going.”', 'So much of the Cup Final will be the same as it was last season, with the same two opponents facing off in what many expect to go the full seven games once again. But there is a difference, and it’s immediately apparent. Where last season the Panthers hosted the Oilers in Game 1, having earned home-ice advantage, this time they’re headed to Edmonton.', 'But that, too, is familiar. The Panthers -- like the Oilers -- have been the road team in each of the first three series of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Panthers are 8-2 on the road in the postseason – including five straight wins – embracing, rather than being concerned about, having to win away from the friendly confines of Amerant Bank Arena.', 'That includes winning Game 7 in Toronto in the Eastern Conference Second Round, and it includes winning the first two games of the Eastern Conference Final -- and the clincher in Game 5 -- at Lenovo Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, against the Carolina Hurricanes.', '“We’re a super-confident team on the road this year,” forward Sam Bennett said. “I think we almost prefer it this year. It’s a little different, less time at home, but we’re up for the challenge.”', 'Prefer it?', '“You have no distractions,” Bennett said. “You’re just with the team, you’re with your guys, and your whole focus is playing hockey.

So we have to be ready right from the start and that’s what we’re working at right now.”', 'The Panthers were third in the Atlantic Division this season, knowing that their finish would likely mean being the road team throughout the playoffs. But as the season wound down, with a difficult ending schedule, the Panthers knew that it mattered more that their players were healthy, that they were prepared for what was to come, rather than fighting to move up and earn home ice.', 'It has paid off.', '“We accepted that, like we knew that we were probably going to have to start every series on the road, and I think we’ve done a good job,” Barkov said. “We accept the challenge and we play exactly the way we want to play.”', 'It helps that the Panthers at home and the Panthers on the road aren’t much different.', '“I don’t think our game changes a whole heck of lot,” coach Paul Maurice said. “We’re not a heavy match team, maybe that’s part of it. We’ve got pretty good forward depth there, so we don’t feel that when we get home and you get home-ice advantage from the match that it’s that big a deal.”', 'In fact, Maurice pointed out that he felt being at home became a negative in the Eastern Conference First Round against the Tampa Bay Lightning, a series that saw the Panthers win all three road games.', '“I felt in Game 3 against Tampa that I actually chased the match more than I should have and took our team out of a rhythm,” he said. “The bench management doesn’t change, so they don’t have to think about the game differently. … You don’t need to feel really good to play for us, you’ve just got to play as hard as you can.

It’s also the first time the Oilers have led a Cup Final series since 1990, the year of their most recent championship.', 'Another streak was also snapped on the ice, but this one pertains to Florida. Prior to Wednesday, the Panthers were 31-0 when leading at the end of the first or second period in playoff games under the tutelage of Paul Maurice. That ended, and it took two of the finest players in the world to get the job done.', 'However, it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows for the Oilers. After leading the game 1-0 early on, the Panthers scored three unanswered goals, with Sam Bennett converting two of them. However, the Oilers dominated from the third period on, outshooting their opponents 24-8.', 'McDavid also had an assist on Mattias Ekholm’s game-tying marker, and Viktor Arvidsson scored for the Oilers. Kasperi Kapanen had two assists in a valiant display.', 'For the goaltenders, Stuart Skinner made 29 saves for the winning side, including 24 straight after a shaky start. Sergei Bobrovsky made 42 saves for the Panthers.', 'First Period', 'Just 1:06 into the game, Edmonton got on the board first when Draisaitl batted in a loose puck to give his team a 1-0 lead. The play came together when Jake Walman teed up a shot from the point that bounced off Bobrovsky. After two of his two teammates whiffed on the loose puck, Draisaitl, who was on the floor just moments before, got off the deck to punch in the goal.', 'It was a physical game from the onset. Evander Kane checked Aaron Ekblad from behind against the boards, and Carter Verhaeghe also got in on some of the action early on.', 'Corey Perry was penalized for high-sticking Gustav Forsling, which put Florida on its first power play of the game. However, the Oilers killed off the penalty and completely neutralized their offense.', 'Bennett tied the game with 9:09 left in the first when he redirected a shot from Verhaeghe that went by Skinner, who fell to the ice after getting hit by Bennett. The Oilers challenged the goal due to goaltender interference, but they were overruled when the officials determined Jake Walman tripped Bennett into Skinner and ruled it a good goal.', 'The Panthers took a 2-1 lead on the very next play when Nate Schmidt fed Marchand in the right circle, and the former Stanley Cup champion blasted it by an outstretched Skinner.', 'Second Period', 'Bennett scored his second of the night two minutes into the second period when Tkachuk carried the puck past the blue line and shoveled a pass to Bennett, who snapped it over Skinner’s blocker to make it a 3-1 game.', 'One minute and 17 seconds later, the Oilers responded when Arvidsson took a drop pass from Podkolzkin and blistered a slap shot that snuck just under Bobrovsky’s glove to put them within a goal.', 'Skinner was locked in from this point forward and made some critical saves to keep the Oilers in the game, including a shot from Verhaeghe that ricocheted off his blocker, and Skinner was able to shovel to his right, and snag the rebound, to boot. Overall, Skinner made 15 saves on 17 shots to end the second.', 'Evan Rodrigues was sent to the box with 1:13 left in the period when he was whistled for high-sticking Draisaitl. At the end of the second, the Oilers still had 47 seconds remaining on the power play, and the Panthers continued to hold a 3-2 lead.', 'Third Period', 'Nearly five minutes into the period, Verhaeghe intercepted the puck and fired on Skinner, but Mattias Ekholm deflected the shot and went up into the netting. It was the second time in the game Verhaeghe had a scoring opportunity but ended up missing the net. He also had a shot that went just over the crossbar in the second period when he caught Skinner just out of position.', 'Ekholm tied the game at three with 13:27 left in the game when he fired a shot from the left circle through the screen that beat Bobrovsky. Kasperi Kapanen set up the play and found McDavid deep in the offensive zone before driving the puck to the net from the right door and shoveling a backhand pass to Ekholm.', 'Kane had a massive opportunity to give Edmonton the lead when he tried to backhand a rebound from the slot, but his shot just went wide of the net and Bobrovsky was eventually able to cover up the puck. However, after the whistle, Aaron Ekblad gave Kane a couple of shoves, which were reciprocated. Officials had to separate the two, and Ekblad was escorted to the Panthers bench. However, both men escaped without taking a penalty.', 'The Oilers were operating with a head of steam in the final period. With five minutes remaining, Edmonton had outshot Florida 11-2.', 'Overtime', 'Skinner made a gorgeous save just over five minutes into the overtime frame when he made a glove save as Aleksander Barkov pulled off a driveby screen. However, Skinner’s incredible concentration allowed him to pull off the save anyway.', 'With 12:51 remaining, Kapanen split three defenders and fired a quick shot that hit the post.', 'Following Thomas Nosek’s penalty for delay of game after shooting the puck over the glass, the Oilers gave their hometown fans a reason to erupt into a frenzy. After the Panthers’ penalty killers got too aggressive, it created a 2-on-1 down low for McDavid and Draisaitl. McDavid fed his wingman a one-timer, which he blasted by Bobrovsky to win the game.', 'Takeaways', 'This was one of those games that can dictate an entire series. The Panthers were firing on all cylinders early, and the Oilers clawed and scratched their way back to defeat the reigning champs.

The former Bruins star’s game-winner came nearly halfway through the second overtime, beating the Oilers’ defense on a breakaway before his backhander trickled past goalie Stuart Skinner.', 'The goal actually marked Marchand’s second of the night. He scored a short-handed goal on a breakaway that gave the Panthers a 4-3 lead with just under eight minutes remaining in the second period.', 'As Marchand was able to bury both breakaway chances, he had one thought in the back of his mind during each goal.', '“Just don’t forget the puck,” Marchand told reporters. “That’s the main thing. I’ve done that before. It’s not a good feeling.”', 'BRAD MARCHAND STUNS THE EDMONTON CROWD AND WINS GAME 2 FOR THE PANTHERS IN DOUBLE OVERTIME 🚨 pic.twitter.com/AwfnAJBULw', 'Marchand even seemed to be a little surprised by his game-winning goal.', '“I think the timing was thrown off a little bit maybe for the goalie because [Oilers defenseman Evan] Bouchard gave me a whack. I don’t really know what happened. But fortunate it went in,” Marchand said.', 'Marchand’s first goal appeared like it was going to be the game-winning goal for a good portion of Friday’s Game 2. The Panthers and goalie Sergei Bobrovsky were able to keep the Oilers off the scoreboard for over 47 minutes of action until Corey Perry scored the game-tying goal with 17.8 seconds remaining.', 'It marked the second straight game that the Panthers gave up the game-tying goal in the third period to force overtime. But as Florida looked to avenge its Game 1 overtime loss, the team remained loose in between the two breaks and thought its newest star veteran was a candidate to save the day.', '“We were upbeat, joking around, having some fun, picking guys who we think was going to score,” Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk told reporters. “I’m sure a lot of guys probably had Marchy.”', 'BRAD MARCHAND SHORTHANDED!!

He’s been incredible for us this whole playoffs, scoring massive goals at massive times. That one was definitely the biggest.”', 'There was a good reason for Bennet, Tkachuk, and the rest of Marchand’s Panthers teammates to feel confident that he would help win them the game. Friday’s goal marked the fifth playoff overtime goal of Marchand’s career. That puts him in a four-way tie for the most playoff overtime goals among active players (Perry, Carter Verhaeghe, Patrick Kane). He’s also tied for the third-most playoff overtime goals in NHL history, with Joe Sakic (eight) and Maurice Richard (six) being the only players with more.', '“He just finds a way,” Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told reporters. “I don’t think the moment ever gets too big for him.”', 'While Marchand might have been cool, calm, and collected during that moment, his parents couldn’t hide their excitement. The Canadian broadcast showed Marchand’s parents, Kevin and Lynn, going crazy in the stands in a clip that went viral after the game ended.', ""Brad Marchand's mom was so excited after her son won it for the Panthers in Game 2 🥲 pic.twitter.com/caxvfJSN1S"", 'Marchand had some fun at his parents’ expense before thanking them.', '“She is one that you need to put a muzzle on,” Marchand jokingly told reporters. “She gets pretty amped up at the games.', '“You know, they’ve always been so supportive, like all of our parents. I mean, I don’t think there’s a player in this league that could say that their parents are not the main reason why they’re here, the sacrifices they all make, and when you go on a journey as a team and you get to the [Cup Final] and you’re going on a run, it’s not just for you. It’s for everybody that helped you get here and all your loved ones that are enjoying the moments, whether they’re here or not, so it’s special to have them in the building.”', 'The two goals in Friday’s Game 2 gave Marchand seven total this postseason, his first with the Panthers. He also has 10 assists, with his 17 points being tied for the second-most on the team this postseason.', 'When the Panthers traded for Marchand right before the trade deadline, not many knew what to expect. The Bruins received less than some thought they would get in a trade involving Marchand (a conditional 2028 first-round pick) as he was injured at the time due to an upper-body ailment.', 'But Marchand, who turned 37 in May, has made himself right at home in Florida ever since he made his team debut in late March. Tkachuk and the rest of Marchand’s Panthers teammates are happy to see him play at the level he did when he was with the Bruins, believing that he still has plenty of hockey left in him.', '“His anticipation and his hockey sense is unbelievable,” Tkachuk said. “You see it tonight with two breakaway goals: just seeing the play and he’s gone.

What the Lightning can learn from the Oilers’ Game 1 win,https://www.rawcharge.com/what-the-lightning-can-learn-from-the-edmonton-oilers-game-1-win-stanley-cup-final-florida-panthers/,"['', 'The Tampa Bay Lightning are no longer in the playoffs. That doesn’t mean we can’t keep talking about them, right? So, along the same lines of the eternal How Does this affect the Leafs? we present a recap from the perspective of what the Lightning pull from both teams in regards to the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 overtime win against the Florida Panthers in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final.', 'If you didn’t watch, well, first off, congratulations on getting a full night’s sleep. For a playoff season that was surprisingly lacking in lengthy overtime contests, it seemed like the game was heading for a second overtime before Leon Draisaitl slammed home his second goal of the game with 31 seconds left in the first bonus frame.', 'The goal sent the home fans into a state of euphoria and gave the Oilers a much needed 1-0 lead in the series. Had they lost this game after blowing a 1-0 lead, and then fighting back from a 3-1 deficit, it would have been a demoralizing loss for the Western Conference Champions.', 'Edmonton’s game-opening goal was a good lesson in how to beat the Panthers. For the Lightning, the lesson is – if you want to get one past Sergei Bobrovsky, get a shot on net and then crash it.', 'Jake Walman flung a shot from the boards that was tipped by Kasperi Kapanen. Bobrovsky made the initial save, because that’s what he’s been doing all post-season. The play was made by Evander Kane Leroy Jenkins-ing his way through the crease. It screened the goaltender a bit, but more importantly, it kept Gustav Forsling from being able to come out and block off Draisaitl.', 'Florida has spent the entire playoff season owning the front of the net. Edmonton got inside of that protection and made them pay. They also didn’t rest on their success either as they pushed the play (and physicality – more on that later). Of course, Florida did their Florida thing. Their confidence level is off of the charts.', 'Therein lies lesson number two – don’t get out of your game plan if things go a little haywire early. The Panthers withstood the pressure and tied the game up. They have the “been there, done that” swagger and have been able to assert their style of play on their opponents no matter what the score of the game is. The Lightning had that swagger during the Cup runs, and its slipped a little over the last few years. They’ve allowed their opponents to dictate the pace of the game.', 'In typical Panthers’ fashion the goal came with a little physical contact and a little controversy. A shot from the slot by old friend Carter Verhaeghe beat Stu Skinner, but Sam Bennett was all up in his crease.', 'Goaltender interference, right? Nope, thanks to Brett Kulak tripping Bennett, which caused the contact. One failed challenge later and Florida made it 2-1 with a power play goal. Things really started to look bleak when Bennett scored his second of the night early in the second period. The mojo for the Oilers was officially gone, and the crowd was taken out of it.', 'Florida has been so very good at changing the pace of the game in the second period throughout the playoffs. It was especially noticeable against the Carolina Hurricanes. There were a few games in that series where Carolina put together really good starts, but then faded in the middle frame as Florida stuck to their system and ground the game to a halt.', 'After putting up 11 scoring chances and 14 shots on goal in the first period, Edmonton only had 6 scoring chances and 8 shots, with most of those coming late in the period. The good news is that on one of their few shots on Bob, they put it past him. What was nice about this play is the speed and efficiency Edmonton had in getting it out of the zone. They didn’t dally or circle it behind the net to regroup. Tampa Bay did that a lot in the opening round series, and it just gave Florida a chance to set things up in the neutral zone.', 'A team can’t stop skating against Florida. To do so invites their forecheck, and usually leads to some chaos. Florida got to that game as the period progressed, but Edmonton didn’t wilt. In fact, they kept doing what they had been doing most of the game, which was matching Florida hit for hit. Both teams ended the night with 51 hits, and there were a few moments where it looked like the Panthers started to anticipate hits and rushed to get rid of the puck.', 'Edmonton tied things up with Mattias Ekholm’s third-period goal. The two teams battled for the last 14 minutes of regulation and then 18 minutes of overtime. With just over two minutes to go in the first overtime, Tomas Nosek flipped a puck into the crowd to earn a delay of game penalty. Part of the reason he did it was because an Oiler was bearing down on him. Nosek rushed the play and made a mistake. Edmonton ended it a shifts later.', 'Perhaps that’s the most important lesson for the Lightning – teams don’t like to get hit. Even if they are the big, bad Panthers. If you can establish a physical presence early and often, it can lead to mistakes later in the game, or later in the series. That doesn’t mean they need to go out and get a bunch of guys that run amok trying to hit everything in sight, but a tough forecheck, and timely physical play can create chances that lead to goals.', 'Edmonton did what they couldn’t do early in last year’s Stanley Cup Final, which was to win a game in which they dominated play. Bobrovsky was the difference last year in Games 1-3. Maybe it was the rust from the long layoff between conference finals, but he wasn’t as sharp as he has been for the last two post-seasons. The Oilers pulled out the win, and now they have the early lead in the series. With both teams back in the swing of things, getting win number two will be even tougher.', 'Support RawCharge by using our Affiliate Link when Shopping Hockey Apparel !']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHpjMUZNUXpoc05rdHNTVE0xVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

A complete player with size (6-foot-3, 214 pounds) and speed, Barkov will be a force at both ends and likely play against McDavid when the Panthers can get that matchup.

Edmonton also has Draisaitl (25 points) and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (18 points) among seven players with at least 10 playoff points and nine who've scored at least four goals, but everything starts with McDavid.

The Panthers won't have the same advantage in experience that helped them win the first three games of the Final last season, so their margin for error will be smaller. But Florida might be deeper than last season with the additions of forward Brad Marchand (14 playoff points; four goals, 10 assists) and defenseman Seth Jones (seven points; three goals, four assists), who's plus-9 and leads the team in averaging 24:59 of ice time."", 'Oilers: They continue their commitment to team defense, Skinner maintains his level of play from the past two rounds, and their depth holds up without forward Zach Hyman, who is not expected to play after having a surgery for an upper-body injury. McDavid and Draisaitl can sometimes win games on their own, but Edmonton has gotten this far again with contributions from up and down its lineup. Having a healthy Evander Kane (11 points; five goals, six assists in 15 playoff games) could make a big difference after a sport hernia and knee injury limited the forward to two games in the Cup Final last season.

Sunrise’s ice isn’t Edmonton’s, known for decades as the NHL’s best, but it isn’t a swamp. And, the biggest home-rink advantage is personnel deployment.', 'Still, you want to strut with Stanley, you can’t be a mouse in your house. Since the NHL came out of the 2005 lockout and excluding the 2020 playoffs that were confined to Edmonton’s Rogers Place, only one team won the Cup with a losing record at home in the Final: 2018-19 St. Louis, which lost two of three at home to the Bruins, but won Games 2, 5 and 7 in Boston.', 'Of the other 17 Cup Finals in that time span, none of the winners lost more than one home game.', 'READ MORE: After excelling on road all playoffs, it’s time for Panthers to produce at home in Cup Final', 'That’s despite, in these times of uniformity among NHL rinks, the lone by-law advantage for home teams is personnel deployment.

You run your top end of your bench harder than you will at home.”', 'Evidence of that: ice times going into Friday’s second overtime. Despite 80 minutes of hockey down, the Panthers had two forwards, center Jesper Boqvist and Jonah Gadjovich, under 10 minutes of ice time for the game. Edmonton, which rolled four lines more successfully, had no such players.', 'If a fast, physical series also becomes a long series, that matters.', '“Florida does like their line matchups,” Edmonton coach Kris Knoblauch said. “So, it’ll be difficult for us to get away from those.

There’s even been some controversy.', '', 'The Edmonton Oilers nearly went up 2-0 in the series but had to settle for a split as things shift to South Florida. There’s been a lot to like about their performance and also some aspects to quibble about.', 'Let’s look at three areas where they’re doing well and three where they’re not.', 'Offense was hard to come by for the Oilers through the first two games of last year’s Final. They scored just once on 51 shots in back-to-back losses as Florida Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky almost seemed to be in their heads.', 'That hasn’t been the case this time around.', 'The Oilers have scored four goals on 46 shots in each game and appear to have more of a book on the star netminder.', 'Pucks were placed on Bobrovsky’s glove side the first five times the Oilers scored. Each shot that has beaten Bobrovsky has been elevated, a good call considering Bobrovsky is one of the best at stopping attempts along the ice in the NHL.', 'The Oilers have a good chance of winning this series if they can continue scoring at a rate anywhere close to this one.', 'Winger Zach Hyman’s absence for the series due to a dislocated right wrist presented the possibility of a gaping hole in the Oilers’ lineup. He went from a scoring wonder last year to a complementary piece and a hitting machine this year.', 'It’s hard to replace that, but the Oilers have done just fine thanks to a largely by-committee approach.', 'Kasperi Kapanen was great in Game 1, and so was the fourth line of Vasily Podkolzin, Mattias Janmark and Viktor Arvidsson. Evander Kane has been everything you thought he could be: playing physical, acting as pest control against the most annoying Panthers and scoring a goal in Game 2.', 'We can’t forget about Corey Perry.', 'He has a goal and an assist. The former was the latest tying marker in Cup Final history when he scored with 17.8 seconds left in regulation of Game 2, and the latter contributed to the winning tally in Game 1.', '', 'Perry’s up to eight goals in 18 games, seven more than he produced in 19 contests during the 2024 run.', '“He only had one goal last year, but we wanted (him back), knowing in the playoffs it’s hard to score and you need guys around the net and finding ways,” coach Kris Knoblauch said. “He’s as good as anybody finding ways to score.”', '', 'The Oilers have also tilted the ice when they’ve loaded up the top line with the 40-year-old Perry and their two superstars, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. Per Natural Stat Trick, the Oilers are outshooting the Panthers 19-8 and out-attempting them 37-16, and they own a 71 expected goals percentage in 22:25 minutes together at five-on-five.', 'Here are the number of shots the Oilers have allowed in the third period in each of the last two games: two in Game 1 and five in Game 2. That five-spot must have felt like a lot considering the Oilers had surrendered no more than four shots in each of the previous four contests.', 'Sure, the Oilers trailed heading into the third period of both games of the Stanley Cup Final, but it sure helps trying to make an offensive push when you defend that well. Besides, Mattias Ekholm scored 6:33 into the third period of Game 1, so things were on level terms from there on.', '“We find our way, get better throughout the game,” defenseman Jake Walman said between the first two games. “Maybe in crunchtime we dial it in a little bit more, but ideally, we’d like to do that from the start of every game.”', 'The way the Oilers have charged back offensively in the third period is worth mentioning, too. It’s something they’ve done all playoffs, dating to their first win in Game 3 against the Los Angeles Kings.', 'The series opener of the Final was their seventh come-from-behind win. They could have made it eight when Perry forced overtime in Game 2. That would have equalled a franchise mark set in 1987 and 1991.', '“We all understand that it’s never over with this group,” McDavid said.', 'The Panthers are in and around the blue paint more than any team the Oilers have faced in the playoffs. That’s been an issue through the first two games.', 'Former Calgary Flames nemesis Sam Bennett has been the ultimate irritant. Bennett was tripped by Brett Kulak in the first period of Game 1 before falling into goalie Stuart Skinner. The puck nicked him on the way into the net. The Oilers challenged for goaltender interference, but the goal was upheld. The Panthers scored on the subsequent power play.', '', '“I would challenge that any day,” Knoblauch said after the game. “Actually, I challenged it. I was on the bench, and I was even looking at it again. I was getting ready for the next lines, and I see the player fall in. I was told he was tripped.', '“If that play happened again, I would challenge it. What I’ve seen in the NHL this year on the challenges for goaltender interference, I had a lot of confidence and would challenge that again.”', 'In Game 2, Bennett was at it again. He was contacted by Ekholm during the first period and toppled into Skinner. This time, with Skinner down on the ice in apparent pain, Bennett was sent off for interference despite neither referee — Chris Rooney or Jean Hebert — initially raising his hand to signal a penalty.', 'In the second period, another former Flames rival, Matthew Tkachuk, was bumped into Skinner as a point shot from ex-Oiler Dmitry Kulikov eluded the goalie. The Oilers opted not to challenge, and the Panthers tied the score at 3.', 'It’s not easy to keep Bennett, Tkachuk and others away from their goalie, but it’s something the Oilers must be more cognizant of.', '“We know they have players that want to drive the net,” Oilers defenseman John Klingberg said after Game 2. “It comes to us trying to box out earlier. But we’re trying to drive the net, too.', '“They’re a high-shooting-volume team, and if you are that, they’re bringing people to the net as well.”', 'The middle stanza hasn’t been kind to the Oilers through two games, and that was especially the case in Friday’s loss.', 'The Oilers were outscored 2-0 in the second frame of Game 2, and they were outshot 14-9. Per Natural Stat Trick, the Panthers out-attempted them 31-13 at five-on-five and had double the number of high-danger chances (8-4).', '“We just lost our legs a little bit,” Draisaitl said after the overtime defeat. “We weren’t as quick to recover pucks, and they’re going to have their push. It’s something to look at.”', '', 'After Game 2, Knoblauch pointed to a couple of areas the Oilers need to improve at to solve their woes in this regard.', '“It was puck execution. I know our passes weren’t sharp and we gave away a lot of pucks,” he said. “If you can’t make that first pass, you’re stuck in the defensive zone, and you might get it up to the neutral zone.', '“But especially in the second period, if you just get it out to the neutral zone, you can’t change, and then you get stuck, and that’s what happened.”', 'Overall, the Oilers have been outscored 3-1 during the second period as the series shifts to Florida. They’ve been outshot 31-17.', '“You’re never going to play a perfect 60 minutes,” Klingberg said. “If you can control the puck most of the time in the second period, you’re going to have fresh legs and having an easier way to change.”', 'The Oilers have had some outstanding moments on the man advantage in the early portion of the series, with two of Draisaitl’s three goals coming in that capacity.', 'Draisaitl scored the winner in Game 1 at 19:29 of overtime after Tomas Nosek’s puck-over-glass penalty. It doesn’t get more important than that. The Oilers can add style to substance, too. McDavid side-stepping Selke Trophy winner Aleksander Barkov and then undressing Aaron Ekblad before feeding Draisaitl for an easy one in the first period of Game 2 was simply an otherworldly move.', '“There’s one player in the world that can make that (play),” Draisaitl said.', 'For all the good with the power play, it struggled after that McDavid masterpiece.', 'The Oilers failed to capitalize on a 33-second two-man advantage a couple of minutes later. They wound up going 1-for-6 on the power play Friday. Worse still, Brad Marchand scored his first of two breakaways when the Panthers were short-handed in the second period.', '', '“As good as our power play is, and as much as I’d like it to score every single time, that’s unrealistic,” Knoblauch said. “As long as they’re getting quality looks — and the majority of our power plays, I feel we have.

No time for pouting.', '“There’s going to be some disappointment,” counselled Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch. “But we’ve had the mentality, no matter what happens —  bad game, close game, overtime, heartbreaking, easy, whatever it is — we put it behind us and we get ready for the next one.', '“You learn in the playoffs, things don’t always go your way.

It’s never going to be easy,” said Draisaitl, who scored his third of the series on a miraculous setup by Connor McDavid. “We need to regroup and be ready for Game 3.”', 'Part of that “regrouping” will involve some further investigative work on how best to deal with a Florida forecheck that simply took over Game 2 in the second period.', 'We expect both teams to have their pushes during a game, but this was much more than that. With the long change in effect in the second frame, Florida absolutely took over the game for almost an entire period — for the second game in a row.', 'It’s fair to say that this one element of the matchup — the Oilers’ ability to solve a Panthers forecheck and break the puck out more cleanly — could be the axis around which this series turns.', 'The good news for Oilers fans is that in every series thus far, they’ve solved their tactical issues and won the vast majority of games in the back half of the series.', '“I think we just lost our legs a little bit, we weren’t as quick to recover pucks,” Draisaitl said of that second period. “They’re going to have their push, of course.

Not only because it led to overtime, but because it was arguably their most consistent frame in Game 1.', 'They had the shots in the first period but still trailed. They struggled to gain possession and generate shots in the second, which played a role in why they were down by a goal. Getting a goal from Mattias Ekholm early in the third gave the Oilers their 20th different scorer this postseason. They also outshot the Panthers 14-2, while having a 58.3% shot share, providing them with a sense of control they had been lacking to start.', 'Although they began overtime on the defensive, their constant ability to apply pressure for the final 15 minutes paid off with Leon Draisaitl scoring the game winner off the power play with 1:06 remaining.', 'They survived the Kasperi Kapanen mini breakaway. They survived the point-blank chance from Trent Frederic at the faceoff circle. They survived when the Oilers had a 5-on-5 sequence they treated like a power play.

Will it be the third period, which saw them get just two shots on goal? Or will it be how they couldn't make the most of their dominant start in overtime?"", ""Draisaitl didn't have a single goal in the 2024 Cup Final.

Draisaitl has scored or assisted on five of the Oilers' six OT goals over the past two postseasons."", 'Leon Draisaitl nets the first goal of the Stanley Cup Final just over a minute into the game for the Oilers vs. the Panthers.', 'The veteran defenseman scored his first goal of this postseason in his second game back from injury. He became the 20th Oiler to score in these playoffs, which is tied for the second most in a single postseason in NHL history. (The 1987 Flyers and 2019 Blues each had 21 different goal scorers.)', 'Bennett had a two-goal effort in a losing cause. He has 12 goals this postseason, the most in a single playoffs in franchise history. Eleven of those goals have been on the road, which is tied with Mark Scheifele (2018) for most road goals in a single postseason in NHL history.', 'Remember: This man was on waivers in November. When the Oilers claimed him, it was viewed as a chance to add depth on the cheap, but it turned into something greater. His game-winning goal in the series-clinching Game 5 overtime victory in the Western Conference finals opened the door for more playing time. He almost did it again in Game 1 in overtime, too, but he did get an assist on the game-winning goal.', ""He has been part of the solution for how the Oilers would fare without Zach Hyman, who sustained an injury in the Western Conference finals that will keep him out the rest of the postseason. Kapanen did his part with three assists, and his five hits allowed the Oilers to maintain the physical edge they've used as part of their identity to reach a consecutive Cup Final."", 'There are two ways to look at what Bennett did in Game 1. The first is that his two-point effort reinforced what has made him a serious candidate to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Bennett was a front-runner before the game, with a postseason-high 10 goals. Collecting two more gives him 18 points, which is tied with Oilers center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins for fourth place.', ""The second is that he's going to get paid this offseason. Earlier Wednesday, the Colorado Avalanche re-signed Brock Nelson to a three-year deal worth $7.5 million annually to avoid potentially losing him in free agency. What Bennett did to help the Panthers reach three consecutive Stanley Cup Finals -- and be in a position to claim at least a second title -- is only going to increase what he could command come July 1."", 'Sam Bennett tallies his second goal of the game to give the Panthers a 3-1 lead over the Oilers.', ""The Oilers' path back to the Stanley Cup Final was based on how their defensive structure made life hellish for the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights, two teams that were in the top five in goals per game in the regular season -- and struggled in the playoffs."", ""Stay up to date with the latest intel from ESPN's experts.\nMLB: McDaniel's latest mock draft »\nNBA: Top 100 prospects » | Mock drafts »\nNFL: Early 2026 first-round predictions »\nNHL: Big board: Top 64 draft prospects »\nWNBA: Top 15 prospects for 2026 draft »"", 'The Oilers had a few challenges in the first period, with Skinner getting partially shielded on the first two goals before having a breakdown in the second period that left their goalie on an island.', 'From there, the Oilers gave up a combined eight shots over the final frames, with the largest concentration coming in the first five minutes of overtime.', 'Of course, the Panthers have found breakthroughs against teams with constricting defensive structures, like the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals. Are the Panthers about to find another in Game 2? Or could the Oilers be on to something that could see them find even more success within their defensive identity?', ""Here's where it gets complicated -- and it goes back to the earlier statement about teams having inflection points. In the second period, the Panthers were aggressive in a way that hardly anyone has been against the Oilers. That resulted in five high-danger scoring chances, along with an overall sense of control."", ""That's what made coming away with just one goal -- especially in a one-goal game -- something that could pose questions about how they make the most of those opportunities going forward."", 'But at the same time, the notion they were forced to survive in an overtime that saw them split the shot share with the Oilers, have more high-danger scoring chances but fail to provide that consistent threat?', ""That could give the Panthers even more to think about in the coming days ... or maybe they won't question the process, given that they had won their last 31 playoff games in which they held a second-period lead.""]",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHpjMUZNUXpoc05rdHNTVE0xVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
Stanley Cup final: Panthers score six in Game 3 demolition of Oilers to take series lead,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/09/stanley-cup-final-panthers-score-six-in-game-3-demolition-of-oilers-to-take-series-lead,"['Edmonton Oilers 1-6 Florida Panthers', 'Champions take 2-1 lead in best-of-seven series', 'Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett scored again, Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe each got their first goal in the Stanley Cup final and the defending champion Florida Panthers capitalized on the Edmonton Oilers’ worst performance in weeks to win Game 3 in a 6-1 rout Monday night and take a 2-1 series lead.', 'The 37-year-old Marchand became the oldest player to score in each of the first three games of a final and the first to open the scoring the next time out after notching an overtime winner. His 11 goals in the final are the most among active players, one more than similarly ageless Corey Perry.', 'Bennett added his NHL playoff-leading 14th goal, just the second at home, after making a big hit on Edmonton’s Vasily Podkolzin that contributed to the turnover to spring him on a breakaway. Marchand and Bennett have combined to score eight of Florida’s 13 goals in the series.', 'But it was not just Marchand and Bennett this time. Verhaeghe buried a perfect shot into the net under the cross bar on the power play, Reinhart made up for missing the net on an earlier attempt, Aaron Ekblad scored to chase Stuart Skinner on the fifth goal on 23 shots and Evan Rodrigues added the exclamation point in the waning minutes.', 'At the other end of the ice, Sergei Bobrovsky earned the “Bobby! Bobby!” chants from a fired up south Florida crowd. The two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender known as “Bob” was on his game for the very few quality chances the discombobulated Oilers mustered, making 32 saves.', 'Perry – at 40 the oldest player in the series – beat Bobrovsky with some silky hands for a power-play goal, keeping up this final being a showcase of cagey veterans along with Marchand.', 'Connor McDavid could not get his team on track, and Edmonton took 15 minors – led by Evander Kane’s three plus a misconduct to add up to 85 penalty minutes – including a brawl with less than 10 minutes left. Trent Frederic and Darnell Nurse, who fought Jonah Gadjovich, got misconducts that knocked them out of a game with an outcome determined long before.', 'After the final looked as evenly matched as can be with Games 1 and 2 each needing extra time, overtime and then double OT, Game 3 was a lopsided mismatch. The Oilers came unglued to the point Jake Walman resorted to squirting water on Panthers players on their bench from his spot on the visiting side.', 'The teams have some extra time off before Game 4 on Thursday night, when the Panthers have the chance to take a 3-1 lead and move to the verge of going back to back.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNHpjMUZNUXpoc05rdHNTVE0xVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
