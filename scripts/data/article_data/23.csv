UBS Hit With $26B Shock: Swiss Regulators Just Changed the Game,https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:57440edb3094b:0-ubs-hit-with-26b-shock-swiss-regulators-just-changed-the-game/,"[""Swiss regulators just dropped a major proposal that could reshape UBS's\nUBS\nbalance sheet for years to come. Following the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance is looking to tighten the screwshard. The plan? Force UBS to fully capitalize its foreign subsidiaries, up from the current 60% threshold, effectively requiring a $26 billion boost in common equity tier one capital. While UBS would be allowed to cut $8 billion in AT1 bonds, the net capital addition still lands at a hefty $18 billion. The proposal wouldn't become law before 2028, and UBS would get a 6- to 8-year window to phase it inbut the message from regulators is clear: no more room for balance sheet loopholes."", ""UBS isn't thrilled. Management called the proposal extreme and warned it could dent the bank's international competitiveness. The new framework would make future foreign expansions significantly more expensiveespecially if they can no longer be financed with holding company debt. Despite the tough tone, UBS shares actually climbed 3.8% after the news, likely reflecting investor optimism that there's still room to negotiate. Parliament has to sign off, and if Swiss voters gather enough signatures, the entire package could face a referendum, delaying implementation or even stopping it altogether. UBS is already gearing up for a drawn-out lobbying campaign, knowing full well that Switzerland's political system leaves space for compromise."", ""But the capital hike is just one piece of the puzzle. The reform package also includes tighter oversight on asset quality, potential fines for misconduct, and the introduction of a senior managers regime to hold executives more directly accountable. Regulators are eyeing tougher treatment for less recoverable assetslike internally developed software and deferred tax creditswhich could further erode capital buffers. These proposed changes could hit the bank's capital position harder than expected if fully enforced. UBS says it plans to actively engage in the consultation and push for alternatives with a more balanced cost-benefit profile. But with regulatory momentum building and political factions divided, investors should brace for a drawn-out battlewith real implications for UBS's capital strategy in the years ahead."", 'Select market data provided by ICE Data services.\nSelect reference data provided by FactSet.

UBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government,https://www.tradingview.com/news/eqs:72297cb85094b:0-ubs-statement-on-regulatory-proposals-made-by-the-swiss-government/,"['UBS AG / Key word(s): Statement\n06-Jun-2025 / 19:30 CET/CEST\nRelease of an ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n6 June 2025\nAd hoc announcement pursuant to Article 53 of the SIX Exchange Regulation Listing Rules News Release\nUBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government\nZurich, 6 June 2025 – UBS supports in principle most of the regulatory proposals the Swiss Federal Council published today.[1] However, UBS strongly disagrees with the extreme increase in capital requirements that has been proposed. These changes would result in capital requirements that are neither proportionate nor internationally aligned.\nThe proposals would require UBS to fully deduct investments in foreign subsidiaries from its CET1 capital. UBS would also need to fully deduct deferred tax assets on temporary differences (TD DTAs) and capitalized software from its CET1 capital. Furthermore, the proposals would necessitate an increase in prudential valuation adjustments (PVAs).\nBased on published financial information from the first quarter of 2025, and given UBS AG’s target CET1 capital ratio of between 12.5% and 13%, UBS AG would be required to hold additional estimated CET1 capital of around USD 24bn on a pro-forma basis, if the recommendations are implemented as proposed. This includes around USD 23bn related to the full deduction of UBS AG’s investments in foreign subsidiaries. These pro-forma figures also reflect previously announced expected capital repatriations of around USD 5bn.\nThe incremental CET1 capital of around USD 24bn required at UBS AG would result in a CET1 capital ratio at the UBS Group AG (consolidated) level of around 19%. At Group level, the proposed measures related to TD DTAs, capitalized software and PVAs would eliminate capital recognition for these items in a manner misaligned with international standards. This would reduce the CET1 capital ratio at UBS Group to around 17%, underrepresenting UBS’s capital strength. Further information is available at www.ubs.com/presentations.\nThe additional capital of USD 24bn would be in addition to the previously communicated incremental capital of around USD 18bn UBS will have to hold as a result of the acquisition of Credit Suisse in order to meet existing regulations. This includes about USD 9bn to remove the regulatory concessions granted to Credit Suisse and around USD 9bn to meet the current progressive requirements due to the enlarged size of the combined business.\nAs a result, UBS would be required to hold about USD 42bn in additional CET1 capital in total.\nAs none of the regulatory changes are expected to become effective before 2027, UBS Group AG maintains its target of achieving an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and an underlying cost/income ratio of <70% by the end of 2026 (both on an exit rate basis). UBS will provide an update on its longer-term returns targets when there is more clarity on the timing of potential changes and when the likely final outcome becomes more visible.\nUBS also reaffirms its capital return intentions for 2025. These include accruing for an increase of around 10% in the ordinary dividend per share and repurchasing up to USD 2bn of shares in the second half of the year, for a total of up to USD 3bn. This plan continues to be subject to UBS Group maintaining a CET1 capital ratio target of around 14% and achieving its financial targets and is consistent with UBS’s previously communicated plans and conservative approach. UBS will communicate its 2026 capital returns ambitions with its fourth quarter and full-year financial results for 2025.\nUBS will actively engage in the consultation process with all relevant stakeholders and contribute to evaluating alternatives and effective solutions that lead to regulatory change proposals with a reasonable cost/benefit outcome. UBS will also evaluate appropriate measures, if and where possible, to address the negative effects that extreme regulations would have on its shareholders.\nAs the largest truly global wealth manager and leading bank in Switzerland, with competitive global investment bank and asset management capabilities, UBS brings financial stability, expertise, economic benefits and international know-how to its home country and to all its clients globally. UBS remains committed to its diversified business model and its unique regional footprint as well as successfully completing the integration of Credit Suisse in the best interest of all stakeholders.\nUBS is reviewing the substantial amount of information published today and will share its further assessment in due course.\n[1] The proposals are available on the website of the Swiss government at www.admin.ch.\nUBS Group AG and UBS AG\nInvestor contact\nSwitzerland: +41-44-234 41 00\nAmericas: +1 212 882 57 34\nMedia contact\nSwitzerland: +41-44-234 85 00\nUK: +44-207-567 47 14\nAmericas: +1-212-882 58 58\nAPAC: +852-297-1 82 00\nwww.ubs.com/media\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, the global economy may suffer significant adverse effects from increasing political tensions between world powers, changes to international trade policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to continue through 2026 and presents significant operational and execution risk, including the risks that UBS may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and business benefits contemplated by the transaction, that it may incur higher costs to execute the integration of Credit Suisse and that the acquired business may have greater risks or liabilities than expected. Following the failure of Credit Suisse, Switzerland is considering significant changes to its capital, resolution and regulatory regime, which, if proposed and adopted, may significantly increase our capital requirements or impose other costs on UBS. These factors create greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions; (iii) inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, residential and commercial real estate markets, general economic conditions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in the current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA; (xiii) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xiv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xv) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services, artificial intelligence and other technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvi) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xvii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with persistently high levels of cyberattack threats; (xviii) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG, UBS AG and regulated subsidiaries of UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xix) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xx) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxi) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict, pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event; and (xxiii) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on its reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on its business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. UBS’s business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in its past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2024.

Read our cookie policy or manage cookies.', 'The Swiss government has unveiled plans to impose stricter regulations on UBS following its acquisition of Credit Suisse, potentially requiring the bank to bolster its core capital by $26 billion. Reuters reports that the key proposal mandates UBS to fully capitalize its foreign units, aligning with expectations from analysts and lawmakers. According to data from IndexBox, this move comes as UBS shares, which have previously underperformed against European peers due to regulatory uncertainties, saw a significant rise of over 6% following the announcement.', ""Currently, UBS is required to capitalize only 60% of its foreign units, with some capital covered by Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. The new regulations, however, would allow UBS to reduce its AT1 bond holdings by $8 billion. UBS executives have expressed concerns that the increased capital requirements could disadvantage the bank compared to its global competitors, potentially undermining Switzerland's standing as a financial hub."", ""The proposal follows the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse, which prompted Swiss politicians, led by Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter, to advocate for stronger protective measures for taxpayers. Keller-Sutter, who now holds Switzerland's rotating presidency, emphasized that the proposed regulations aim to enhance trust in the financial sector's stability and competitiveness. The federal council plans to draft the proposals for stakeholder consultations in the latter half of 2025, with laws requiring parliamentary approval expected to come into effect by 2028."", ""UBS's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, currently at 14.3%, might rise to 17% under the new rules, surpassing global rivals such as JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs.

This regulatory shift could prompt UBS to reconsider its business strategy, potentially leading to asset sales as the bank focuses on growth in the U.S. and Asia."", ""Additionally, the Swiss government proposed measures to enhance the capabilities of the market regulator FINMA, criticized for its handling of the Credit Suisse crisis. These measures include holding bankers accountable, empowering the regulator to impose fines, and facilitating the restraint of pay and bonus clawbacks.

The stock has been essentially unchanged since then, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index — which tracks the biggest banks in the euro area — has climbed about by more than 40%.', 'Details of the phase-in including its exact length and whether it will be front-loaded or linear will likely be announced in the fall when the government publishes the finalized draft of the adjusted law. It’s as of now unclear whether the decision on these details will rest with the government alone or require parliament’s approval, according to an official.', 'Switzerland’s leadership also presented new rules for capital quality. These will update how banks have to quantify intangible items such as deferred tax assets, in-house software and other hard-to-value items they have on their books, adding up to a potential increase of $3 billion. ', 'These changes are planned to be implemented via an ordinance which doesn’t require lawmakers’ sign-off. Therefore they may enter force as early as the middle of next year.', 'The government will now finalize the draft and propose the changes to parliament, which is expected to debate them in 2027. The new law likely won’t take effect before 2029. As UBS can lobby lawmakers, there’s a chance that the draft will be watered down. In any case, the government has proposed a phase-in period of between 6 and 8 years once the changes are agreed, meaning the bank could have until 2035 or later to fully comply. ', '“The phase in period is even longer than what the market expected and the AT1 offset softens the blow somewhat,” said Johann Scholtz, an analyst at Morningstar. “This is as bad as it will get for UBS from a capital perspective.

UBS Faces $26 Billion Capital Demand From Swiss Bank Reforms,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ubs-faces-26-billion-capital-demand-from-swiss-bank-reforms,"['UBS Group AG is facing as much as $26 billion in fresh capital requirements to be phased in over the next decade under banking reform proposals from the Swiss government, following an announcement that provides clarity for investors after months of uncertainty.', 'The biggest hit is set to come from a proposal that would require UBS to increase the capital held at home against its stakes in foreign units to 100% from 60% at present, according to a long-awaited outline for legislation released Friday. The government estimates that this will force UBS to add as much as $23 billion in capital to its Swiss-based main unit. ', 'UBS shares extended gains on Friday, up 5% as of 3:30 p.m. in Zurich. ', 'The proposals are nevertheless a defeat for UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti who lobbied for more than a year to stave off some of the reforms mooted in the wake of the collapse of Credit Suisse in 2023. They’ve railed against the capital plan as an “extreme overreaction” which puts them at a disadvantage to global peers and warned it could hurt their plans for investor payouts.', '“The shares have massively underperformed its peers and it seems that today’s proposals were priced in,” said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich. ', 'The government justified its stance on the basis that UBS would be more resilient in a crisis, and in any case the bank has many ways to mitigate the impact of the changes. The figure of $26 billion, in common equity tier 1 capital, represents the impact of all new measures together based on today’s balance sheet. ', 'At the same time, the government said that the measures could also entail a reduction of about $8 billion in the use of convertible debt, or AT1s, as capital. That would leave a need for an extra $18 billion in so-called “going concern” capital, it said.', '“How high the additional capital requirement is in the end depends on many factors and to a large extent also on how UBS reacts to these measures,” Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said at a press conference in Bern.', 'The proposal on foreign units means that in an emergency, UBS “should be able to dispose of foreign subsidiaries either in part or in their entirety, without this negatively impacting the capitalization of the parent bank,” the government said in a statement. “The required build-up of capital can ideally be achieved without raising capital, without excessively restricting organic growth and without excessive reduction in distributions.”', 'Bloomberg reported the decision on foreign units in May. ', 'The government also unveiled a list of other measures to be drafted into ordinances and legislation, including substantial new powers for the financial regulator Finma.', 'Friday’s announcement caps months of uncertainty for UBS after officials first touted the plans in April last year, a factor that has weighed on the share price. The stock has been essentially unchanged since then, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index — which tracks the biggest banks in the euro area — has climbed about by more than 40%.', 'Switzerland’s leadership also presented new rules for capital quality. These will update how banks have to quantify intangible items such as deferred tax assets, in-house software and other hard-to-value items they have on their books, adding up to a potential increase of $3 billion. ', 'These changes are planned to be implemented via an ordinance which doesn’t require lawmakers’ sign-off. Therefore they may enter force as early as the middle of next year.', 'The government will now finalize the draft and propose the changes to parliament, which is expected to debate them in 2027. The new law likely won’t take effect before 2029. As UBS can lobby lawmakers, there’s a chance that the draft will be watered down. In any case, the government has proposed a phase-in period of between 6 and 8 years once the changes are agreed, meaning the bank could have until 2035 or later to fully comply. ', '“The phase in period is even longer than what the market expected and the AT1 offset softens the blow somewhat,” said Johann Scholtz, an analyst at Morningstar. “This is as bad as it will get for UBS from a capital perspective. From here they can lobby for concessions and look to take mitigating actions themselves, for instance upstreaming capital from overcapitalised subsidiaries.” ']",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZXRlZsWm5FelpGODVYM05EVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhQlFveU9uUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

UBS Hit With $26B Shock: Swiss Regulators Just Changed the Game,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2913422/ubs-hit-with-26b-shock-swiss-regulators-just-changed-the-game,"[""Swiss regulators just dropped a major proposal that could reshape UBS's (UBS, Financial) balance sheet for years to come. Following the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance is looking to tighten the screws—hard. The plan? Force UBS to fully capitalize its foreign subsidiaries, up from the current 60% threshold, effectively requiring a $26 billion boost in common equity tier one capital. While UBS would be allowed to cut $8 billion in AT1 bonds, the net capital addition still lands at a hefty $18 billion. The proposal wouldn't become law before 2028, and UBS would get a 6- to 8-year window to phase it in—but the message from regulators is clear: no more room for balance sheet loopholes."", ""UBS isn't thrilled. Management called the proposal “extreme” and warned it could dent the bank's international competitiveness. The new framework would make future foreign expansions significantly more expensive—especially if they can no longer be financed with holding company debt. Despite the tough tone, UBS shares actually climbed 3.8% after the news, likely reflecting investor optimism that there's still room to negotiate. Parliament has to sign off, and if Swiss voters gather enough signatures, the entire package could face a referendum, delaying implementation or even stopping it altogether. UBS is already gearing up for a drawn-out lobbying campaign, knowing full well that Switzerland's political system leaves space for compromise."", ""But the capital hike is just one piece of the puzzle. The reform package also includes tighter oversight on asset quality, potential fines for misconduct, and the introduction of a senior managers regime to hold executives more directly accountable. Regulators are eyeing tougher treatment for less recoverable assets—like internally developed software and deferred tax credits—which could further erode capital buffers. These proposed changes could hit the bank's capital position harder than expected if fully enforced. UBS says it plans to “actively engage” in the consultation and push for alternatives with a more balanced cost-benefit profile. But with regulatory momentum building and political factions divided, investors should brace for a drawn-out battle—with real implications for UBS's capital strategy in the years ahead."", ""We'd love to learn more about your experiences on GuruFocus.com and how we can improve!""]",Business,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZXRlZsWm5FelpGODVYM05EVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhQlFveU9uUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

UBS Group AG Faces Sell Rating Amid Regulatory Uncertainty and Capital Challenges,https://www.tipranks.com/news/ratings/ubs-group-ag-faces-sell-rating-amid-regulatory-uncertainty-and-capital-challenges-ratings,"['Analyst Antonio Reale from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Sell rating on UBS Group AG (UBS – Research Report) and decreased the price target to CHF25.00 from CHF28.00.', '', '', 'Antonio Reale has given his Sell rating due to a combination of factors impacting UBS Group AG. The primary concern is the uncertainty surrounding the new regulatory framework, which is expected to extend beyond the upcoming public consultation. This uncertainty includes a significant capital requirement estimated at $25-27 billion, aligning with market expectations but not yet fully priced in by the market. Additionally, the potential full deduction of foreign subsidiaries could lead to a substantial capital bill, with a long legislative process that might not conclude until 2027, and the possibility of a referendum further complicating the situation.\nMoreover, Reale anticipates that UBS will not engage in stock buybacks in 2025-26, and he projects a decrease in the underlying Return on Common Equity Tier 1 (RoCET1) to around 13-14%, down from previous targets. The potential for re-domiciliation of UBS is considered a last resort, with other measures such as enhancing the capital-light investment banking model or disposing of foreign businesses being more likely. These factors, combined with the prioritization of financial stability over shareholder interests, contribute to the Sell rating.', '', '', '', 'Disclaimer & Disclosure', ""Looking for a trading platform?

This is $2 billion lower than the $20 billion estimated by JP Morgan earlier this week.', 'UBS shares jumped 6% following the announcement and ended Friday’s trading session 3.8% higher.', 'The Swiss bank will become more stable and attractive in areas such as asset management, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said during a press briefing on Friday. “I don’t believe that the competitiveness will be impaired, but it is true that growth abroad will become more expensive,” she said in comments reported by Reuters.', 'UBS said while it supports “in principle” most of the regulatory proposals announced on Friday, it strongly disagrees with the “extreme” increase in capital requirements. Based on the bank’s first-quarter results, its CET1 capital ratio target of between 12.5% and 13% — along with previously communicated capital — the firm said it would be required to hold around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital in total.', 'The bank maintained its target of achieving an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and also reaffirmed its capital return intentions for the year.', '“UBS will actively engage in the consultation process with all relevant stakeholders and contribute to evaluating alternatives and effective solutions that lead to regulatory change proposals with a reasonable cost/benefit outcome. UBS will also evaluate appropriate measures, if and where possible, to address the negative effects that extreme regulations would have on its shareholders,” the bank said.', 'Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, noted that the news was “as bad as it will get for UBS.”', 'The banking giant “can now lobby for some concessions and take some actions themselves to mitigate impact, for instance upstream some excess capital from its subsidiaries,” Scholtz said. He added that while negotiations will start immediately, there will be a long-phase out for UBS to deploy the measures, with the earliest that it will apply in full being 2034.', 'JPMorgan analysts led by Kian Abouhossein also stressed that a long lead time of six to eight years for UBS to fulfil the deduction of investments in its foreign units is a “positive” outcome for the bank. With finalization expected around 2027, JPMorgan expects full implementation by 2033 at the earliest.', 'UBS is expected to generate around $12 billion [per annum] in profits with a dividend of about $3 billion, which means the bank can “fulfill its ‘capital gap’ by 2033+ and still continue with buybacks,” the analysts said.', 'The Swiss National Bank said it supported the measures from the government as they will “significantly strengthen” UBS’ resilience.', '“As well as reducing the likelihood of a large systemically important bank such as UBS getting into financial distress, this measure also increases a bank’s room for manoeuvre to stabilise itself in a crisis through its own efforts. This makes it less likely that UBS has to be bailed out by the government in the event of a crisis,” SNB said in a Friday statement.', 'UBS has been battling the specter of tighter capital rules since acquiring the country’s second-largest bank at a cut-price following years of strategic errors, mismanagement and scandals at Credit Suisse.', 'The shock demise of the banking giant also brought Swiss financial regulator FINMA under fire for its perceived scarce supervision of the bank and the ultimate timing of its intervention.', 'Swiss regulators argue that UBS must have stronger capital requirements to safeguard the national economy and financial system, given the bank’s balance topped $1.7 trillion in 2023, roughly double the projected Swiss economic output of last year. UBS insists it is not “too big to fail” and that the additional capital requirements — set to drain its cash liquidity — will impact the bank’s competitiveness.', 'At the heart of the standoff are pressing concerns over UBS’ ability to buffer any prospective losses at its foreign units, where it has, until now, had the duty to back 60% of capital with capital at the parent bank.', 'Higher capital requirements can whittle down a bank’s balance sheet and credit supply by bolstering a lender’s funding costs and choking off their willingness to lend — as well as waning their appetite for risk. For shareholders, of note will be the potential impact on discretionary funds available for distribution, including dividends, share buybacks and bonus payments.', '“While winding down Credit Suisse’s legacy businesses should free up capital and reduce costs for UBS, much of these gains could be absorbed by stricter regulatory demands,” Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note preceding the FINMA announcement. ', '“Such measures may place UBS’s capital requirements well above those faced by rivals in the United States, putting pressure on returns and reducing prospects for narrowing its long-term valuation gap. Even its long-standing premium rating relative to the European banking sector has recently evaporated.”', 'The prospect of stringent Swiss capital rules and UBS’ extensive U.S. presence through its core global wealth management division comes as White House trade tariffs already weigh on the bank’s fortunes.

UBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government,https://www.tradingview.com/news/eqs:9c05187ba094b:0-ubs-statement-on-regulatory-proposals-made-by-the-swiss-government/,"['UBS AG / Key word(s): Statement\nUBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government\n06-Jun-2025 / 20:50 CET/CEST\nDisclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group.\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n6 June 2025\nAd hoc announcement pursuant to Article 53 of the SIX Exchange Regulation Listing Rules News Release\nUBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government\nZurich, 6 June 2025 – UBS supports in principle most of the regulatory proposals the Swiss Federal Council published today.[1] However, UBS strongly disagrees with the extreme increase in capital requirements that has been proposed. These changes would result in capital requirements that are neither proportionate nor internationally aligned.\nThe proposals would require UBS to fully deduct investments in foreign subsidiaries from its CET1 capital. UBS would also need to fully deduct deferred tax assets on temporary differences (TD DTAs) and capitalized software from its CET1 capital. Furthermore, the proposals would necessitate an increase in prudential valuation adjustments (PVAs).\nBased on published financial information from the first quarter of 2025, and given UBS AG’s target CET1 capital ratio of between 12.5% and 13%, UBS AG would be required to hold additional estimated CET1 capital of around USD 24bn on a pro-forma basis, if the recommendations are implemented as proposed. This includes around USD 23bn related to the full deduction of UBS AG’s investments in foreign subsidiaries. These pro-forma figures also reflect previously announced expected capital repatriations of around USD 5bn.\nThe incremental CET1 capital of around USD 24bn required at UBS AG would result in a CET1 capital ratio at the UBS Group AG (consolidated) level of around 19%. At Group level, the proposed measures related to TD DTAs, capitalized software and PVAs would eliminate capital recognition for these items in a manner misaligned with international standards. This would reduce the CET1 capital ratio at UBS Group to around 17%, underrepresenting UBS’s capital strength. Further information is available at www.ubs.com/presentations.\nThe additional capital of USD 24bn would be in addition to the previously communicated incremental capital of around USD 18bn UBS will have to hold as a result of the acquisition of Credit Suisse in order to meet existing regulations. This includes about USD 9bn to remove the regulatory concessions granted to Credit Suisse and around USD 9bn to meet the current progressive requirements due to the enlarged size of the combined business.\nAs a result, UBS would be required to hold about USD 42bn in additional CET1 capital in total.\nAs none of the regulatory changes are expected to become effective before 2027, UBS Group AG maintains its target of achieving an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and an underlying cost/income ratio of <70% by the end of 2026 (both on an exit rate basis). UBS will provide an update on its longer-term returns targets when there is more clarity on the timing of potential changes and when the likely final outcome becomes more visible.\nUBS also reaffirms its capital return intentions for 2025. These include accruing for an increase of around 10% in the ordinary dividend per share and repurchasing up to USD 2bn of shares in the second half of the year, for a total of up to USD 3bn. This plan continues to be subject to UBS Group maintaining a CET1 capital ratio target of around 14% and achieving its financial targets and is consistent with UBS’s previously communicated plans and conservative approach. UBS will communicate its 2026 capital returns ambitions with its fourth quarter and full-year financial results for 2025.\nUBS will actively engage in the consultation process with all relevant stakeholders and contribute to evaluating alternatives and effective solutions that lead to regulatory change proposals with a reasonable cost/benefit outcome. UBS will also evaluate appropriate measures, if and where possible, to address the negative effects that extreme regulations would have on its shareholders.\nAs the largest truly global wealth manager and leading bank in Switzerland, with competitive global investment bank and asset management capabilities, UBS brings financial stability, expertise, economic benefits and international know-how to its home country and to all its clients globally. UBS remains committed to its diversified business model and its unique regional footprint as well as successfully completing the integration of Credit Suisse in the best interest of all stakeholders.\nUBS is reviewing the substantial amount of information published today and will share its further assessment in due course.\n[1] The proposals are available on the website of the Swiss government at www.admin.ch.\nUBS Group AG and UBS AG\nInvestor contact\nSwitzerland: +41-44-234 41 00\nAmericas: +1 212 882 57 34\nMedia contact\nSwitzerland: +41-44-234 85 00\nUK: +44-207-567 47 14\nAmericas: +1-212-882 58 58\nAPAC: +852-297-1 82 00\nwww.ubs.com/media\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, the global economy may suffer significant adverse effects from increasing political tensions between world powers, changes to international trade policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed its outlook and strategic direction and introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to continue through 2026 and presents significant operational and execution risk, including the risks that UBS may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and business benefits contemplated by the transaction, that it may incur higher costs to execute the integration of Credit Suisse and that the acquired business may have greater risks or liabilities than expected. Following the failure of Credit Suisse, Switzerland is considering significant changes to its capital, resolution and regulatory regime, which, if proposed and adopted, may significantly increase our capital requirements or impose other costs on UBS. These factors create greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect UBS’s performance and ability to achieve its plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions; (iii) inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, residential and commercial real estate markets, general economic conditions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in the current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to its businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of its RWA; (xiii) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xiv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xv) UBS’s ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services, artificial intelligence and other technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvi) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xvii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with persistently high levels of cyberattack threats; (xviii) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG, UBS AG and regulated subsidiaries of UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xix) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xx) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxi) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict, pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event; and (xxiii) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on its reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on its business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. UBS’s business and financial performance could be affected by other factors identified in its past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2024. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nEnd of Inside Information\n06-Jun-2025 CET/CEST The EQS Distribution Services include Regulatory Announcements, Financial/Corporate News and Press Releases.\nArchive at www.eqs-news.com', 'UBS AG / Key word(s): Statement', 'UBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government', '06-Jun-2025 / 20:50 CET/CEST', 'Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group.', 'The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.', 'UBS statement on regulatory proposals made by the Swiss government', 'Zurich, 6 June 2025 – UBS supports in principle most of the regulatory proposals the Swiss Federal Council published today.[1] However, UBS strongly disagrees with the extreme increase in capital requirements that has been proposed. These changes would result in capital requirements that are neither proportionate nor internationally aligned.', 'The proposals would require UBS to fully deduct investments in foreign subsidiaries from its CET1 capital. UBS would also need to fully deduct deferred tax assets on temporary differences (TD DTAs) and capitalized software from its CET1 capital. Furthermore, the proposals would necessitate an increase in prudential valuation adjustments (PVAs).', 'Based on published financial information from the first quarter of 2025, and given UBS AG’s target CET1 capital ratio of between 12.5% and 13%, UBS AG would be required to hold additional estimated CET1 capital of around USD 24bn on a pro-forma basis, if the recommendations are implemented as proposed. This includes around USD 23bn related to the full deduction of UBS AG’s investments in foreign subsidiaries. These pro-forma figures also reflect previously announced expected capital repatriations of around USD 5bn.', 'The incremental CET1 capital of around USD 24bn required at UBS AG would result in a CET1 capital ratio at the UBS Group AG (consolidated) level of around 19%. At Group level, the proposed measures related to TD DTAs, capitalized software and PVAs would eliminate capital recognition for these items in a manner misaligned with international standards. This would reduce the CET1 capital ratio at UBS Group to around 17%, underrepresenting UBS’s capital strength. Further information is available at www.ubs.com/presentations.', 'The additional capital of USD 24bn would be in addition to the previously communicated incremental capital of around USD 18bn UBS will have to hold as a result of the acquisition of Credit Suisse in order to meet existing regulations. This includes about USD 9bn to remove the regulatory concessions granted to Credit Suisse and around USD 9bn to meet the current progressive requirements due to the enlarged size of the combined business.', 'As a result, UBS would be required to hold about USD 42bn in additional CET1 capital in total.', 'As none of the regulatory changes are expected to become effective before 2027, UBS Group AG maintains its target of achieving an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and an underlying cost/income ratio of <70% by the end of 2026 (both on an exit rate basis).
