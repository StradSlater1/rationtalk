ADA Issues New MASLD Guidelines,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/ada-issues-new-masld-guidelines-2025a1000esb,"['', '', 'June 02, 2025', 'A new consensus report from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides a practice-oriented framework for screening and managing metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with diabetes and prediabetes.', 'Published online on May 28, 2025, in Diabetes Care, the report is a comprehensive update to the recommendations the ADA released in 2023. It is intended for clinicians treating patients with diabetes — primarily type 2 diabetes (T2D) — but also type 1 diabetes with obesity and prediabetes. Topics covered include the rationale for the recent change in terminology, epidemiology, fibrosis risk stratification, monitoring, treatment, and referral guidance, with interprofessional team management emphasized throughout.', '“This will provide primary care doctors and anyone taking care of people with diabetes the tools to diagnose [MASLD] early and guide therapy…to prevent cirrhosis, and refer to the hepatologist as needed for additional therapy and monitoring,” lead author Kenneth Cusi, MD, professor of medicine at the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, told Medscape Medical News.', 'The guidelines recommend that clinicians routinely screen people with T2D or prediabetes for MASLD. “We explain that the liver should be incorporated into our management in the same way we do for chronic kidney disease, eye disease, and nerve disease as an end-organ damage that is particularly affected by diabetes,” Cusi said.', 'In the United States, at least 70% of people with T2D have MASLD, about half of whom have the more progressive form termed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH). About 1 in 5 with T2D have advanced liver fibrosis. The presence of MASH increases the risks for complications including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and overall mortality, according to the new consensus report.', 'Liver disease has not been a focus of diabetes management until recently, Cusi noted. “We didn’t think about it. The epidemic of obesity, and with that, of diabetes, is driving this liver disease. The obesity epidemic has had a big worsening since the 1990s, so this damage in the past 20 or 30 years is just now becoming evident in the liver.” ', 'The document reviews the current nomenclature for SLD, which was officially changed in 2023 to remove the words “fatty” and “alcoholic.” Now, MASLD is defined as the presence of SLD with at least one metabolic risk factor such as obesity, hypertension, prediabetes, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or T2D, with minimal or no alcohol consumption (< 20 g/d for women; < 30 g/d for men).', 'The term “MetALD” is used for those with MASLD who also have increased alcohol consumption (20-50 g/d for women; 30-60 g/day for men). Steatosis in the setting of alcohol consumption above those levels is termed “alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).”', 'The term MASH is defined as steatohepatitis with at least one metabolic risk factor and minimal alcohol consumption. “At-risk MASH” refers to steatohepatitis with clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2 or higher).', 'The document recommends routine screening of people with T2D, prediabetes, and/or obesity with cardiovascular risk factors, with the goal of identifying those with high-risk MASH. Intervention is then aimed at preventing fibrosis progression and cirrhosis.', 'A graphic diagnostic algorithm advises initial use of the noninvasive Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) tool, which risk stratifies based on age, liver enzymes, and platelet count.', '“The FIB-4 is composed of very simple things that are already in the electronic medical record of all patients. We also discuss the role of electronic medical records to improve implementation,” Cusi said.', 'Those with a FIB-4 < 1.3 have a low risk for future cirrhosis and can be managed in primary or team care with optimized lifestyle and repeated FIB-4 every 1-2 years.', 'If the FIB-4 is > 2.67, direct referral to a liver specialist is advised. If FIB-4 is between 1.3 and 2.67, a second risk-stratification test is recommended. Ideally, this would be a liver stiffness measurement (LSM), most commonly with transient elastography. If that is unavailable, an alternative is the noninvasive enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test.', 'If the LSM is < 8.0 kPa or ELF is < 7.7, the fibrosis risk is low and routine management can continue with repeat testing in 1-2 years. But if higher, hepatology referral is recommended.', 'The report details lifestyle modification for MASLD, including nutrition plans; physical activity; behavioral health; and the role of diabetes self-management, education and support. The role of obesity treatment in people with MASLD, both metabolic surgery and pharmacotherapy, is also discussed at length.', 'No current pharmacologic treatments have been approved for MASLD, but both semaglutide and tirzepatide have demonstrated benefit in treating MASH and are approved for treating T2D, obesity, and other related comorbidities.', 'A thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, resmetirom, was approved in early 2024 for the treatment of MASH with fibrosis stages F2 and F3, but is extremely expensive at about $50,000 a year, Cusi noted. An older, generic glucose-lowering drug, pioglitazone, has also shown benefit in reducing fibrosis and may be a lower-cost alternative.', 'The document also includes a section on alcohol intake, which complicates the MASLD picture, Cusi noted. “We think that this is going to help doctors to consider alcohol, which is often overlooked and under-reported. If patients have moderate fibrosis, they should completely quit alcohol.”', 'Cusi has received research support (to his institution) from Boehringer Ingelheim, Echosens, Inventiva, Labcorp, and Perspectum, and has served as a consultant for Aligos Therapeutics, Arrowhead, AstraZeneca, 89bio, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, ProSciento, Sagimet Biosciences, Siemens USA, Zealand Pharma, and Terns Pharmaceuticals.', 'Miriam E.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe progression of a broader condition now known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which typically affects those drinking little or no alcohol, per the Guardian. The disease is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. About 5% of the global adult population and 4% of the US population is estimated to have MASH, which leads to liver scarring and increases the risk of cirrhosis, kidney disease, and liver cancer.', '', 'Researchers found that fewer than one in five people with MASH actually have a diagnosis, which means the majority are unaware they have the disease. The study, published in Lancet Regional Health Europe, calls for diagnosis rates to double from 2022 levels to prevent a sharp rise in health costs and personal suffering. Non-invasive screening methods like blood tests and MRI scans are now available, leading researchers to recommend screening for people with type 2 diabetes, obesity plus risk factors, or persistently high liver enzymes.', ""Experts warn that if identification and treatment don't improve, both health and economic consequences will escalate. Calls for increased use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in MASH treatment are growing, as these medications can help curb calorie intake, prompt weight loss, and potentially reduce liver scarring. The study also notes that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin may help reduce liver fat and fibrosis, highlighting the growing potential of medication as part of the solution.

The publication emphasizes the importance of recognizing MASLD as a critical comorbidity in individuals with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes and outlines guidance for clinicians to improve early detection, risk stratification, and treatment strategies.', 'The episode begins by placing MASLD in historical context alongside other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. The hosts explain that MASLD, previously referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD, reflects a metabolic-driven pathology and is now better understood as a progressive condition that increases the risk of cirrhosis, liver transplantation, cardiovascular disease, and impaired quality of life. The more advanced form, MASH (Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), represents progression toward hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.', 'A major focus is the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, a noninvasive, cost-effective screening tool calculated from common laboratory tests (platelets and liver function markers) to assess fibrosis risk. The consensus report advises routine FIB-4 scoring in adults with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with central obesity. Based on risk thresholds, further evaluation may involve transient elastography (FibroScan), advanced imaging, or hepatology referral.', 'The hosts commend the ADA for offering a clear clinical algorithm for evaluation and referral, as well as pharmacotherapy recommendations tailored to disease severity. For individuals with early-stage fibrosis, lifestyle modification and diabetes therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, semaglutide) are first-line approaches. For advanced fibrosis (F2–F3), resmetirom is the only currently approved treatment for MASH. The report also highlights complications from hepatic dysfunction—including impaired hypoglycemia awareness and sarcopenia—underscoring the broader metabolic impact of MASLD.', 'Isaacs and Bellini stress that MASLD should be approached with the same clinical rigor as other diabetes-related complications.

Titled “Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) in People with Diabetes: The Need for Screening and Early Intervention. A Consensus Statement of the American Diabetes Association” it emphasized the need for screening and early intervention to slow disease progression and improve outcomes. The statement was published in the May 28, 2025, issue of the medical journal Diabetes Care.', '', 'MASLD, formerly referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver in people with diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, who drink little to no alcohol. Affecting about 70% of people with type 2 diabetes, MASLD places them at increased risk for metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall liver-related mortality. It is also associated with extrahepatic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.', '', '“This new consensus statement is of critical importance as the number of people with MASLD is on the rise,” shares Dr. Corbin. “Many health care professionals have limited knowledge on how to best help people with diabetes who are at risk of liver disease, and our panel wanted to help bridge this knowledge gap.”', '', 'Approved by the ADA Professional Practice Committee (PPC) in March 2025, the consensus report calls for liver fibrosis screening and risk stratification for people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, especially in the presence of obesity and other cardiometabolic risk factors. In addition to providing detailed guidance on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of liver disease in people with diabetes or prediabetes, the document also details topics of special consideration, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, alcohol intake, and the value of an interprofessional approach to disease management.', '', '“MASLD is an area of particular interest to me, not only because of the complex pathophysiology, but also because we now have tools that are readily available to clinicians for early detection,” explains Dr. Corbin. “People with type 2 diabetes and certain ethnic groups are at high risk for disease and poor outcomes, and it is these populations that are often overlooked for screening. There is currently one medication on the market that is approved to treat MASLD. However, the new generation of obesity medications have strong evidence of improving liver health. This means that now, we not only have ways to detect those at risk, but viable care plans that include medications in addition to foundational treatments like nutrition and exercise.”', '', 'AdventHealth gastroenterologist and transplant hepatologist Torfay Roman, MD, serves as medical director for the program at AdventHealth Winter Park aimed at early detection and comprehensive treatment of people with MASLD. She believes the new ADA consensus statement provides important and timely guidance on a growing health care concern.', '', '“This is a welcome and critical step in increasing awareness for a disease that was previously often missed or under-diagnosed in a vulnerable and high-risk population,” says Dr. Roman. “We now better understand the significant prevalence of MASL and MASH in people with diabetes and the long-term impact on mortality and overall prognosis. The last 15 years have shown us an exponential climb in MASH as a driver of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, with MASH now being the number one indication for liver transplant in the U.S. in females and number two indication overall.

Its more aggressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. People with type 2 diabetes, obesity or other cardiometabolic risk factors are at significantly higher risk. However, despite its severity, MASH often shows no symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage -when it can progress to cirrhosis or liver cancer.', 'On 5 June 2025, The Lancet Regional Health Europe published an article in which leading hepatology and metabolic health experts call on health systems to double the MASH diagnosis rate by 2027. This advanced disease affects millions silently and is rarely detected early, representing missed opportunities for timely intervention that could improve outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens.', 'The paper highlights non-invasive tools and AI-based technologies that can help identify at-risk patients in primary care, as well as the recent approval of a new treatment, which makes the need for improved diagnostic access all the more pressing. Effective treatments must go hand in hand with better diagnosis, the authors argue.', 'To deliver a paradigm shift in the response to MASH and eliminate this growing public health threat by 2030, the authors propose concrete actions such as routine screening for at-risk groups, integrating liver testing into regular health check-ups, updating reimbursement policies, and fostering collaboration across primary care, endocrinology, cardiology, and patient organizations.', '""The future of the fight against MASH lies in anticipation: not only treating advanced patients but also identifying those without fibrosis early on. This shift towards preventive hepatology is key to improving the metabolic health of millions around the world,"" says  Jeffrey Lazarus, Head of the Public Health Liver Group at ISGlobal, a centre supported by the ""la Caixa"" Foundation, and lead author of the study.', 'In parallel, over 40 experts have published the People-First Liver Charter in Nature Medicine, a roadmap to end the stigma surrounding liver diseases, which often delays timely diagnosis and treatment. The authors call for a shift towards person-centred language and care models that prioritise the individual over the diagnostic label. This approach aims to promote respect, empathy and reduce health inequities, in line with recent global efforts to rename liver diseases with more inclusive terms, thereby enhancing dignity and empowerment for patients. It has been endorsed by 70+ organizations. ', ""A policy brief focusing on Spain was also presented during the Global Think-tank, analysing the current situation and offering concrete recommendations to advance the national health system's response to MASLD/MASH. Spain is facing a significant rise in liver disease cases, with a growing impact on mortality and healthcare costs."", 'In 2021, approximately eight million people in Spain were living with MASLD. This figure is expected to rise to 12.7 million (27.6% of the population) by 2030. In 2016, there were an estimated 1.8 million cases of MASH, a number projected to increase to 2.7 million by 2030. As a result, MASH-related mortality is expected to double, reaching around 7,590 deaths in that year. Furthermore, direct healthcare costs associated with the disease could more than double, from $1.48 billion in 2021 to $3.5 billion in 2040.', 'Faced with this scenario, Lazarus warns: ""We recommend a national strategy led by the Ministry of Health and in close collaboration with all autonomous communities that includes a MASLD registry, its inclusion in key health indicators, enhanced training for healthcare professionals, automated diagnosis in primary care, and strengthened community-based services.""', 'Although it affects more than 1.5 billion people, chronic liver disease remains largely excluded from global strategies to address non-communicable diseases (NCDs). With less than four months until the United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs, set to take place in September 2025, experts gathered in Barcelona called for this historical gap to be closed and for the accelerated integration of chronic liver diseases into global health policies and clinical practice.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)', 'Be the first to rate this article', 'Posted in: Medical Condition News | Healthcare News', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'News-Medical.Net provides this medical information service in accordance with these terms and conditions.
