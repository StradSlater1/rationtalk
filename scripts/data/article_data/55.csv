Post time is 6:50 p.m. ET.', ""Here's the field:"", 'A closer look at the field for the Belmont Stakes 2025', '2. Sovereignty: Derby winner skipped Preakness to train up to Belmont; still getting better; on go to fire his best shot.', '3. Rodriguez: Wood Memorial was the top-rated Derby prep from a speed figure standpoint; should shrug off other speed types and be tough to run down.', '7. Journalism: Turned the Preakness into a rodeo but still won with an impressive late burst.', '6. Baeza: Should be put into the game earlier by Flavien Prat; plenty of mile and a quarter in his pedigree.', '7. Journalism: Continues to train forwardly after two big races. Can adapt to any pacescenario. Don’t expect jockey Rispoli to get cute in here, will move wide at the ¼ pole. Gets up intime to take the third jewel of the Triple Crown.', '6. Baeza: Should be closer to the pace than in the Derby due to a better post. Improving colt still hasupside and will take some beating in the lane.', '3. Rodriguez: The controlling speed. Concerned that he has scratched twice since his Wood Memorialtriumph in early April. Takes them a long way but gets caught at the 1/8 pole.', '2. Sovereignty: Enters fresh of his Kentucky Derby victory. He won’t get the same pace set up as lasttime and that will compromise his late kick. Expect a bold middle move only to flatten out in the finalfurlong.', ""7. Journalism: I have thought he's been the best 3-year old all along and not going to deviate from that now. The trouble he overcame to win the Preakness was incredible. Only great horses overcome what he had to overcome in the upper stretch. He ran a race that would have won the Kentucky Derby most years, but Sovereignty just ran a better one. His workout last Sunday was outstanding. Trainer Mike McCarthy would not be asking him to run for the third time in five weeks if he was not ready."", '6. Baeza: The half brother to 2023 Kentucky Derby winner Mage and 2024 Belmont and Haskell Stakes winner Dornoch is just scratching the surface. He ran somewhat greenly in the Kentucky Derby, but still closed fast to be third, just a neck behind Journalism. A cleaner trip could put him right there.', '2. Sovereignty: The Kentucky Derby winner is more rested than Journalism after he skipped the Preakness. He has by far the best closing kick of anybody in the race, but the pace scenario may not set up that closing kick like the fast pace did in the Derby.', ""3. Rodriguez: It always dangerous to dismiss a Bob Baffert-trained horse who will be on the lead. Being a son of 2020 Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Authentic, he can get the distance. The question is having missed the Derby and Preakness due to a foot bruise will he be as sharp as the other main contenders. Plus, with Crudo in the race, there will be some pressure on him early in the race."", '7. Journalism: After making his move too early in the Kentucky Derby, overtaken by Sovereignty in the final furlong, jockey Umberto Rispoli was much more patient in the Preakness, rallying late for the victory. Look for the same type of ride here, with Journalism’s late kick the best in the division.', '2. Sovereignty: The two top picks have established themselves as the class of the 3-year-old division, and nothing changes here. Look for another stretch battle between two contenders, neither of whom has been out of the top two for a combined nine straight starts, all against graded stakes competition, including a 1-2 finish in  the Kentucky Derby.', '3. Rodriquez: Will be on the front end trying to steal this one, just like in the Wood Memorial. That’s a tall order here, but look for the pacesetter to hang on and hit the board.', '8. Heart of Honor: Made the long trip from Dubai and ran a respectable fifth in the Preakness. Will be running at the end and could be part of the superfecta.', '7. Journalism: He ran a remarkable race in the Preakness, losing important momentum coming into the lane and then somehow making up five lengths in the last furlong to rally and win. While he got beat in the Derby, he ran very well. He will be hard to beat here.', '6. Baeza: He was unfortunate to draw the far outside post in the Derby, which forced rider Flavien Prat to drop back so he could save some ground. Baeza, who was only making his fifth start of his career, got stuck in between horses a bit, . Still, he put in a big late run and has legitimate, high-end upside. He should be able to sit closer to the early pace. ', ""2. Sovereignty: He was a deserving Derby winner at a track where he also had a five-length win as a two year old last year. He's been pointed to this race since then and is certainly a logical contender. His running style will put him near the back early, and behind his two main rivals, which will give him more work to do in the lane. "", ""3. Rodriguez: He was going to be a pace factor in the Derby but an injury forced a scratch. He projects as the main speed, which is always dangerous. He will have to deal with pace rival Crudo and hold off some legitimate rivals, which is likely going to be too much to get him into the winner's circle. But he will be a factor one way or another."", '6. Baeza: Unorthodox in a Belmont Stakes to like a horse who needed three starts to break maiden but expecting Journalism to be short this week and Sovereignty to be pace-compromised.', '1. Hill Road: Gorgeously bred for this trip.', '7. Journalism: Beyers have been sliding.', '2.

Baffert's horse, Rodriguez, missed the Kentucky Derby due to a foot bruise and was held out of the Preakness Stakes. Two of Baffert's three Belmont wins came by Triple Crown winners, his latest being Justify in 2018. Rodriguez is 6-1 in the 2025 Belmont Stakes odds, trailing the top three finishers from this year's Kentucky Derby. Journalism, who finished second in the Kentucky Derby before winning the Preakness Stakes, is the 8-5 favorite in the 2025 Belmont Stakes odds. He is followed by Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty (2-1) and third-place finisher Baeza (4-1), so which horses should you back with your 2025 Belmont Stakes betting picks? With an accomplished field set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what SportsLine horse racing expert Gene Menez has to say before making any 2025 Belmont Stakes picks or horse racing predictions."", ""A former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010."", 'In 2015, Menez accurately gave out the Kentucky Derby superfecta, which paid $1,268.20 for $2. In 2017, he tweeted out his Kentucky Derby picks, including Always Dreaming to win, and hit the Pick 4, which paid almost $6,900 on a $1 bet.', ""In May of last year, Menez nailed 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby. In November, he crushed the late Pick 4 on Breeders' Cup Saturday for a $5,303 jackpot. This year, he hit the winner and exacta in the Holy Bull Stakes and the winner, trifecta and superfecta in the Florida Derby. At the Kentucky Derby earlier this month, Menez hammered the exacta and trifecta for a $1,045 payout. Anyone who has followed him on betting apps like FanDuel Racing and TwinSpires could have been way up, even more if they used the latest FanDuel Racing promo code and TwinSpires offer code."", 'For the Belmont Stakes, Menez has handicapped the 2025 Belmont Stakes field, made his picks, and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.', ""One of Menez's surprising 2025 Belmont Stakes picks: He is fading Journalism, even though he is the 8-5 favorite. The betting favorite has only won the Belmont Stakes 42% of the time (66 of 156 runnings), and Journalism is dealing with an elite field on Saturday. He is not only facing Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, but he is also competing against horses like Rodriguez and Baeza."", ""Journalism is the only horse to run in all three Triple Crown races this year, leaving him at a rest disadvantage compared to some of the other horses in the field. Aside from Triple Crown winners American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018), no horse has won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont since 2005. There are simply too many quality horses in Saturday's field to justify Journalism's short price. Journalism a horse to fade when finalizing how to bet the Belmont Stakes 2025, according to Menez. See which horses to back here."", 'Instead, Menez\'s top pick is a horse who will be ""tough to catch down the stretch."" Menez is sharing who he likes, along with his top 2025 Belmont Stakes picks, over at SportsLine.', ""Which horse wins the Belmont Stakes 2025, and how should you construct your wagers for the final Triple Crown race of the year?

I don’t see it that way. There are other horses who could surprise,"" said Johnny Avello, director of race and sportsbook operations for DraftKings.', 'Avello, who’s been around horse racing much of his life and is one of the keenest betting minds in the sport, serves up his insights on 2025 Belmont Stakes odds.', 'Battle of Saratoga', 'For the second straight year, the Belmont Stakes is at Saratoga, while Belmont Park undergoes renovations. Monday’s post-position draw saw Journalism land the No. 7 gate in an eight-horse field, while Sovereignty will break from the No. 2 gate.', 'Morning Line odds then went up, with Journalism an 8/5 favorite, narrowly ahead of Sovereignty at 2/1 for Saturday’s 7:07 p.m. ET post time on FOX. There’s plenty to like about both horses, most notably that each already has a Triple Crown win this year.', '""I think Journalism and Sovereignty will both be bet pretty heavily.

On the flip side, Journalism ran the Derby on May 3, then the Preakness on May 17, and will now run the 1.25-mile Belmont.', '""Sovereignty and Journalism have both run good in the slop,"" Avello said.

Those two horses should be on the front end early, and we’ll see how far they can go,"" Avello said.', 'Rodriguez was set to run the Kentucky Derby, but had to withdraw a couple of days out with a hoof issue. So he’s back and going on plenty of rest as the 6/1 fourth choice.', 'Crudo didn’t run the Derby. But on Preakness Saturday at Pimlico, he ran on the undercard in the Sir Barton Stakes and rolled to a 7.5-length victory. Crudo is at 15/1 odds, so an upset there would represent a nice payout.', 'Avello also mentioned 10/1 fifth choice Hill Road and 30/1 long shot Heart of Honor.', '""Hill Road won the Peter Pan Stakes, and he was third in the Tampa Bay Derby,"" Avello said. ""He’s ridden by one of the best jockeys, Irad Ortiz Jr., and he has one of the best trainers, Chad Brown.', '""I could see Heart of Honor maybe getting third. So you might want to use him in your trifectas.""', 'Heart of Honor is 30/1 to win the Belmont, after skipping the Derby and taking fifth in the Preakness.', 'Free Money', 'In both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, DraftKings put up significant bonus money for those betting via DK’s horse racing app. Deemed King of the Track, the bonus was $1 million in the Derby and $250,000 in the Preakness.', 'By opting in on the app, then making at least a $5 to-win bet on a horse, customers got a chance at a share of the bonus money. The caveat, of course, is that your horse had to win.', 'In the Derby, DraftKings paid out an additional $291 to every King of the Track bettor who wagered on Sovereignty to win.

Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, who sat out the Preakness Stakes, returns to the field to make a run at winning two of the three legs of the Triple Crown. Journalism, the runner-up at Churchill Downs and the winner of the Preakness Stakes, will attempt to do the same.

The likes of Ortiz, Jr., Saez and Prat have enjoyed the most success in 2025 thus far. According to Equibase, no jockey has won more prize money than Velazquez. History will be made at Saratoga Race Course as well. In 1993, Julie Krone became the first woman to win a Triple Crown race, when she was victorious aboard Colonial Affair at that year's Belmont Stakes. Should Osborne win aboard Heart of Honor, she would join Krone in the history books."", 'In terms of the best pairings between jockey and trainer, it starts at the top. The combination of Rispoli and McCarthy, powering Journalism, has proven to be formidable in the first two legs of the Triple Crown. The Alvarado-Mott duo leading Sovereignty also proved its mettle with an impressive win at a sloppy track at Churchill Downs. If looking towards history in terms of jockey-trainer pairings, look no further than the longshot Crudo, led by train and four-time Belmont Stakes winner Pletcher, as well as the accomplished jockey Velazquez. The combination of Baffert, who has three Belmont Stakes victories to his name, and Smith, who has won the third-most prize money all-time among jockeys, is a promising one behind Rodriguez.', 'There have been no scratches yet for the Belmont Stakes.

"Belmont Stakes 2025: Rodriguez headed in right direction, but is he there yet?",https://www.drf.com/news/belmont-stakes-2025-rodriguez-headed-right-direction-he-there-yet,"['David GreningJun 04, 2025', ""SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. – More often than not when he’s come to the Belmont Stakes, trainer Bob Baffert has had the horse to beat. In five of the 12 Belmonts in which he’s run, Baffert was attempting to complete a Triple Crown, something American Pharoah did in 2015 and Justify accomplished in 2018.\nIn Saturday’s 157th Belmont Stakes, to be run at 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga for the second straight year, Baffert sends out Rodriguez, who is listed as the 6-1 fourth choice on the morning line. Baffert believes Rodriguez is a good horse. He’s just not sure if he’s good enough – yet – to compete with the likes of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty and Derby runner-up and Preakness winner Journalism.\n“He’s a horse that is getting better,” Baffert said Wednesday morning on his first day in Saratoga. “I don’t think he’s at where he’s going to be. He reminds me a lot of his sire Authentic; he didn’t get really good until the fall. September, when he won the COVID Derby, he was really coming around.”\nAuthentic would run second in the Preakness and then win the Breeders’ Cup Classic and was crowned 2020 Horse of the Year.\nRodriguez is coming off his best race, a front-running, 3 1/2-length victory in the Grade 2 Wood Memorial on April 5 at Aqueduct. He was entered in the Kentucky Derby but had to scratch due to a quarter crack on a hind foot. Baffert said he ran out of time to make the Preakness and decided to take him home to Southern California and see how he trained before electing to run in the Belmont.\n:: DRF Belmont Stakes Packages: Save up to 52% on PPs, Clocker Reports, Betting Strategies, and more.\n“His last few works, he worked well, good enough to bring him up here,” Baffert said.\nRodriguez has won twice from five starts. In his maiden win, going a two-turn mile, he led from the start and beat Baeza by seven lengths. After a decent second to stablemate Citizen Bull in the Robert Lewis Stakes on Feb. 1, Rodriguez finished third, 11 1/4 lengths behind Journalism, in the Grade 2 San Felipe on March 1. Flavien Prat rode Rodriguez in the San Felipe.\n“When Prat rode him he said he was just too wound up, he used himself up going to the gate,” Baffert said. “We worked with him, got his engine calm.”\nBaffert took blinkers off Rodriguez for the Wood Memorial, a race where Mike Smith, riding him for the first time, put him on the lead. Rodriguez never looked back, winning handily and galloping out super.\n“He won the Wood, but this is a different field of horses,” Baffert said. “He’s running against the best.”\nBaffert has run multiple horses against Journalism during the winter and spring without success.\n“Journalism, I have a lot of respect for him,” Baffert said. “I’ve been watching him all winter. I’ve been chasing him all winter. He just keeps getting better and better. I think he’s the horse to beat.”\nEvidence that Rodriguez is improving comes from Simon Harris, a New York-based exercise rider who got on the horse before the Wood Memorial and has gotten on him this week.\nHarris, after taking Rodriguez to the gate Wednesday and galloping once around Saratoga’s main track, told Baffert “He’s way more dialed in up here.”\nBefore the decision by the connections of Crudo to run in the Belmont, Rodriguez looked like the main speed of the Belmont field.

He wanted no part of it.”\nBaffert and Smith are both three-time Belmont Stakes winners.

The former has won five of seven races, while the latter has two victories across five starts. The 2025 Belmont Stakes on Saturday will mark the second time they square off after Journalism prevailed over third-place finisher Rodriguez at the San Felipe Stakes. Will Rodriguez exact revenge by claiming The Test of Champion on Saturday? Beating Journalism is one thing, but winning the Belmont Stakes is another, and Journalism is 6-1 in the 2025 Belmont Stakes odds to win. Journalism is the 8-5 favorite among the 2025 Belmont Stakes horses, followed by Sovereignty (2-1) and Baeza (4-1). Before making any 2025 Belmont Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and 2025 Belmont Stakes futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling, considering his domination of Triple Crown races. "", ""A fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling hit the top three finishers at the Kentucky Derby in the correct order and then nailed the exacta in this year's Preakness Stakes. He also predicted the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last seven years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. Anyone who has followed him on those picks is up huge and first-time users can boost their bankroll with the latest FanDuel Racing promo code and TwinSpires promo code."", 'Now, with the 2025 Belmont Stakes post positions set and odds on the board, Demling is sharing his 2025 Belmont Stakes betting picks and 2025 Belmont Stakes predictions over at SportsLine to help you figure out how to bet the Belmont Stakes. Go here to see them.', ""Demling just revealed his 2025 Belmont Stakes projections for Journalism and Sovereignty, and surprisingly, he isn't picking either horse to win, even though they each won a leg of this year's Triple Crown and are the two favorites. Journalism tops the odds board at 8-5, but favorites have just a 42% win rate at the Belmont. That's noticeably lower than the race that Journalism just won, as the favorite has prevailed at the Preakness 49% of the time. Also, the horse displayed a lack of stamina down the stretch when finishing second at the Kentucky Derby, which is the same 1 1/4 miles distance as the Belmont."", ""Meanwhile, Sovereignty has proven he can sustain over 1 1/4 miles but hasn't shown he can run a good race at Saratoga. His first career start came at the track, and he had to make up lots of ground in order to finish fourth in a 10-horse field. While the horse did display a career-high speed figure in his Derby win, he still only ranks fourth in terms of top Equibase speed figures amongst the 2025 Belmont field. Given the drawbacks that both Sovereignty and Journalism have, Demling doesn't see them worth using in horse racing bets at their short odds. See which other 2025 Belmont Stakes horses to avoid at SportsLine."", 'Demling is especially high on an underdog who could be ""the best value in the race"" and will spice up your exotics.

Stuck in heavy traffic at the top of the stretch, it appeared as if Journalism wouldn’t have the space, or the time, to get up and pass the longshot Gosger, running the best race of his career. With a thrilling late move to win, this colt returns once again for the third leg of the Triple Crown to settle the score with Sovereignty as strong contenders Baeza and Rodriguez round out the top contenders. ', 'Journalism (8-5) enters as the morning line favorite in this field of eight and breaks from post seven. His running style has been well established at this point, typically closing from mid-flight. That nearly cost him in Pimlico with some trip issues late, and now he faces much fresher competition as the least rested of this group. ', 'Once again run over a Saratoga track which typically favors speed, this year’s Belmont may differ from last year’s, which saw an incredibly dry track give a major advantage to those on the front end. Dornoch was able to go gate to wire in the first ever 10-furlong Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, as two others set track records at sprint distances that weekend. With rain potentially on the horizon, a softer surface could benefit those coming from mid-pack like Journalism.', '', 'After scratching out of the Derby following a Wood Memorial win, Bob Baffert’s Rodriguez (6-1) returns here as the likely pace-setter with an early challenger in Todd Pletcher’s longshot runner Crudo (15-1). These two should battle for the top spot early, and could make things difficult for each other if Crudo is able to pressure Rodriguez. In the Wood Memorial, Rodriguez got away with very little pressure and took advantage of an easy trip, but that may be difficult here with another furlong and a quicker pace if Crudo breaks well. ', 'Following them should be Pletcher’s other entry in Uncaged (30-1) who has two wins in four tries, both on muddy tracks. After a disappointing race in the Peter Pan last time, this one may appear overmatched, but with the surface advantage and positioning, he could be in the perfect spot with the others all preferring to finish from well off the pace.', 'PICKS', '', 'Journalism and Baeza (4-1) should be next, with Sovereignty (2-1) starting in behind them and the typically late runners Hill Road (10-1) and Heart of Honor (30-1) rounding out the rear. Baeza could be one that stays a bit closer to the leaders this time after falling too far back in Kentucky and still climbing up into third, as he has shown form as a stalker, albeit in very small fields. ', 'If the early fractions from the first two end up being quick, coupled with a softer surface, this race could favor Sovereignty who ran his best at Churchill on a sloppy track and has the rest advantage over his main competition in Journalism. Baeza remains the other top challenger depending on his positioning early but will certainly be in the mix. Those two took advantage of quick fractions at Churchill, with Baeza in particular closing well despite a tough trip. A top-flight effort from either runner could be enough to put them in the winner’s circle if Journalism shows fatigue off of his quicker turnaround. ', 'Of the other late finishers, Hill Road appears to be the other that will love the distance as long as Irad keeps him from drifting too far back. Coming off a strong late finish in the Peter Pan, this Chad Brown trainee may be rounding into form at the right time, and could have a favorable set of circumstances here to run his best. ', 'For one of the top speed runners to win, they would most likely need to get free of any pressure within the first half mile. This doesn’t appear to be likely assuming they both break and are keen on capturing the lead. Through his first five starts, Rodriguez has only run winning races from the front, and the more lightly raced Crudo has been in complete control against lesser fields in two straight. ', 'They still should have the leg up on the pair of 30/1 longshots who remain unproven here. Heart of Honor was able to make a nice late move in the stretch in the Preakness in his first try in North America, but left far too much ground to make up and swung wide. Perhaps a better trip gives him a puncher’s chance to end up finishing in the top four, after being a model of consistency when racing in Dubai. ', 'Barring an easy beginning for Rodriguez, this Belmont should be a test of rest versus rust among Derby winner Sovereignty, Preakness winner Journalism, and Derby show horse Baeza. The three top contenders are a step above the rest based on their recent past performances and could get the pace set up and softer surface to thrive. ', 'If Journalism runs his best despite the heavy workload, he is the one to beat here even with the loss to Sovereignty last month and Baeza always on his tail. Hill Road will need to improve some to compete for the final jewel of the Triple Crown, but could be dangerous here at a price if given the right trip.

The 157th Belmont Stakes will take place at Saratoga Race Course for the second year in a row due to ongoing renovations at the iconic Belmont Park. "", 'The post time is set for 6:41 p.m. ET, and the race will be broadcast on FOX.', 'I think we are in for another memorable weekend. And when it comes to betting on the race, I have you covered. ', ""So let's jump into my betting card and thoughts on this Saturday's big race."", '1. Hill Road: +1000 (bet $10 to win $110 total)\nTrainer: Chad Brown\nJockey: Irad Ortiz', ""The Peter Pan winner appears to be the best of the Triple Crown newcomers, but I do not think we’re looking at a horse that can win the race. He could, however, manage his way into the trifecta from off the pace. That's something he’s done in all three of his starts on dirt, including when he was 61-1 for his previous connections in the BC Juvenile. I’m not sure what was behind him in the Peter Pan, but you probably have to use for third just out of respect for the jockey/trainer combo. "", '2. Sovereignty: +200 (bet $10 to win $30 total)\nTrainer: Bill Mott\nJockey: Junior Alvarado', ""The Derby winner ran a huge race — his career-top Beyer — after getting a clear run home. It wasn’t the cleanest of trips, though, as he did clip heels early in the race. I didn’t have an issue with Bill Mott skipping the Preakness, as he knows his horse and he’ll be pointed toward the bigger races the remainder of the year. Disappointed, yes, but I get it. We know he can handle the offgoing, so any rain will not be an issue. What could be an issue is the pace setup. He’s likely not going to get the mad dash for the lead as he did in the Derby, which means he’s not going to get the same pace to close into. Saratoga also has a tendency to be a bit more kind to horses closer to the lead on big-stakes days. And that's not to say it's a conveyor belt, but it can be hard on dead closers. He can certainly win, but I get the sense that Journalism will get the jump on him, and, unlike he did in the Derby, hold him off late. But if you’re playing multi-race wagers, you obviously want to be covered with him. "", '3. Rodriguez: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\nJockey: Mike Smith', 'The presence of Crudo likely means Rodriguez won’t catch a flier out of the gate and wire the field like he did in the Wood Memorial. That said, he certainly has a bit more class at both this level and routing than Crudo. He was scratched prior to the Derby with a foot issue, but there’s no reason to believe he isn’t good to go here. He’ll be a pace factor at the minimum, and if you’re looking for a bit or a price play, he’s the logical choice. However, asking him to make up about 11 lengths on Journalism — which is what he was beaten by in the San Felipe — seems like a tall order. I’ll limit my use to underneath.', '4.

Crudo: +1500 (bet $10 to win $160 total)\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher\nJockey: John Velazquez', 'Crudo hasn’t been headed in either of his last two races — his maiden win and a win in the Sir Barton — so we know Johnny V will have this horse on the lead, giving Rodriguez company up front. While speed is always dangerous, I can’t see him hanging around here for a piece of the tri. But the owners, including chef Bobby Flay, will get a thrill for a while. ', '6. Baeza: +400 (bet $10 to win $50 total)\nTrainer: John Shirreffs\nJockey: Flavien Prat', 'You can go one of two ways with Baeza. The first is that he’s set to take a big step forward, and we haven’t seen his best yet as he’s made just five lifetime starts. Off a five-week rest, this should be a career best for a runner who’s related to 2024 Belmont winner Dornoch. The other way to view Baeza — he faced Rodriguez in what were both of their second starts — Rodriguez beat him by seven lengths that day when Baeza was 15-1. He was 14-1 in the Santa Anita Derby and couldn’t keep Journalism from going by, despite Journalism having trouble in the race. He was 14-1 again in the Derby and finished behind both Sovereignty and Journalism. So what are we to believe will be different here, especially with Baeza at one third of the price he’s been? Maybe we get a change in tactics? He is certainly the buzz horse and can win, but his price will likely be way shorter than his true odds should be. It wouldn’t be surprising in the least if he runs third behind the two that finished in front of him in Louisville. ', '7. Journalism: +160 (bet $10 to win $26 total)\nTrainer: Michael McCarthy\nJockey: Umberto Rispoli', 'Journalism will be the only runner to participate in all three legs of the Triple Crown as he’s fresh off his runner-up finish in the Derby and dramatic win in the Preakness. I must admit, I was a tad surprised he came out of the Preakness as well as he apparently has and is running here. But I’m glad he is. Much credit to trainer Michael McCarthy. He’s looked great on the track here as well. His versatility and athleticism are his strengths, as evidenced by what we saw in the Preakness. Maybe he hit the front in Louisville a bit too soon? Who knows? But he ran a winning race that day and just got beat by Sovereignty, who simply ran a better race. Given what I expect from the pace scenario Saturday, I think Journalism gets the jump on Sovereignty. I think Journalism has enough to hold him off this time to become the first horse in 70 years to finish second in the Derby, then go win the Preakness and Belmont. ', '8. Heart of Honor: +3000 (bet $10 to win $310 total)\nTrainer: Jamie Osborne\nJockey: Saffie Osborne', 'Credit to the connections for shipping to the U.S. to give the Preakness a try, but Heart of Honor never looked comfortable over the Pimlico surface and was never in the race.

Belmont Stakes 2025: Ranking the field from 1st to last,https://www.horseracingnation.com/news/Belmont_Stakes_2025_Ranking_the_field_from_first_to_last_123,"['', '', ""Even without the possibility of a Triple Crown winner, this year's Belmont Stakes has plenty of intrigue. The setting of Saratoga makes for the perfect backdrop for the rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby and a few interesting new shooters."", 'Journalism, Sovereignty and Baeza stamped themselves as the three best horses in their crop before the Kentucky Derby, and it was nice to see the result confirm their status. They are in a league of their own, and the biggest question is the order in which they will finish when they square off again on Saturday. Below I rank all eight runners in the 2025 Belmont Stakes from first through last. ', '', '', '1st, Journalism, (8-5). This colt is the definition of relentless, and if any horse can shrug off a big effort three weeks later it is this runner. He was the clear leader of this division before the Kentucky Derby, and his Preakness Stakes win was remarkable. It is easy to make the case that the wet track in Kentucky moved him down a peg and Sovereignty up a notch. He continues to run well without ideal trips and Saturday could be the day he gets smooth sailing. The son of Curlin will prove that horses still are capable of running in all three stages of the Triple Crown and will get his revenge on Sovereignty. ', ""2nd, Baeza, (4-1). John Shirreffs's pricey colt is bred to be a good one and might be the most rapidly improving horse in this 3-year-old crop. His Beyer Speed Figure from Daily Racing Form has improved in every start, and another step forward could make him the horse to beat. He was farther back than he likely wanted in the Kentucky Derby from a wide draw, but he has shown twice now that the gap between him and Journalism is not much. Despite a small field, the Grade 1 Santa Anita Derby was the strongest prep, and it would not be surprising to see the top two finishers repeat that result in the Belmont Stakes.  "", ""3rd, Sovereignty, (2-1). Bill Mott's colt was primed and ready for a peak performance in the Kentucky Derby (G1), and he delivered with a ferocious late kick to defeat Journalism and Baeza. His win was not a fluke as he had strong prior form leading up to the race, but I do think the wet track moved him up a bit as Journalism's form was a touch stronger prior to the Kentucky Derby and was validated in the Preakness Stakes. Sovereignty has been rested instead of running in the Preakness Stakes to the dismay of myself and others, but he should be fresh after that career-best performance. He is likely to put forth another strong effort, but the only way to make money is to keep him or Journalism out of the exacta and I have a slight preference to Journalism. "", ""4th, Rodriguez, (6-1). Bob Baffert's colt is the likely pace setter in this race and could be dangerous if he is able to shake off Crudo early. He showed nice improvement in the Wood Memorial Stakes (G1) without blinkers, and his two races in which he has been able to make the lead have led to results that would make him a prime contender. He has not been nearly as good when he can not make the lead, and the tactics used aboard Crudo will make or break his chances. He is the only runner outside the Kentucky Derby trio who has a path to victory. "", '5th, Hill Road, (10-1). The son of Quality Road showed improvement when winning the Peter Pan Stakes (G3) after a disappointing third-place finish in the Tampa Bay Derby (G3). He should have no problem with the added distance and will be hoping for a fast early pace. He is a bit of a plodder, but he will be picking up the pieces. ', ""6th, Heart of Honor, (30-1). Jamie Osborne's colt is a notch below the best in this crop, but he has shown he can handle the distance and pass tired horses. He did not have the cleanest of trips in the Preakness and came with an honest rally to run fifth. He is not a win contender, but he is the type of runner who could fill out the bottom of a superfecta at a big price."", ""7th, Crudo, (15-1). The Sir Barton Stakes winner owns two romping wins in a row and now is tested for class. He has yet to show he can pass horses or run beyond 1 1/16 miles. Rodriguez has run his best races on the lead and is not likely to concede the front to this colt. Todd Pletcher's runner might have a nice future in front of him, but he is not likely to get the scenario he needs to be at his best on Saturday. "", ""8th, Uncaged, (30-1). Todd Pletcher's second entrant will be doing a rain dance on Saturday. There is a chance of light rain, but it would be surprising if this colt gets the muddy track he needs. His two efforts on a fast track resulted in a fourth-place finish in a five-horse field and a distant sixth-place finish in the Peter Pan Stakes (G3). Even if he gets a wet track, he is still up against it from a class standpoint."", 'GET BELMONT SUPER SCREENER!']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVBVSGcwWmsxSVFuZzVTa2hyVFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdZZEU1U05FUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

The choice sparked renewed discussion about the scheduling of horse racing’s three Triple Crown events and the modern viability of having three classics run in a five-week period.', 'But, at least temporarily, all that chatter can die down.', 'The focus for the next few days will be on Sovereignty’s return in the Belmont Stakes, which features a loaded field. Journalism (the Kentucky Derby runner-up and Preakness Stakes winner), Baeza (third in the Derby) and Rodriguez (a highly touted Bob Baffert trainee) are expected to pose stiff competition for Sovereignty in the Belmont, which will again be contested at a shortened distance of 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga.', '“He’s improved, as many of these horses have,” Mott said following Monday evening’s post position draw. “This entire group, if you look at their form and the way they’ve developed over the course of this year, I think they’ve made steady progress. It should be an interesting race on Saturday.”', 'Sovereignty, who will begin the Belmont Stakes from post position No. 2 near the inside rail, is the second choice in the morning line odds at 2-1. Journalism is the morning line favorite for the 157th running of the Belmont at 8-5 odds.', '“I thought being a small field, eight horses, I was going to be happy with whatever post position we got,” said Mott, the 71-year-old trainer who won the 2010 Belmont Stakes with Drosselmeyer. “I don’t think it’s a big issue for him.”', 'Jockey Junior Alvarado, who has been aboard Sovereignty for all three of his wins, once again has the mount for Saturday’s Belmont.', 'How do Sovereignty’s connections expect him to fare in his first outing since defeating Journalism by 1 1/2 lengths over a sloppy and sealed Churchill Downs track to win the Kentucky Derby on May 3?', '“Bill has been very happy with him since he’s got up to Saratoga,” Michael Banahan, Godolphin’s USA director of bloodstock, said Tuesday afternoon. “He came out of the Derby in good shape, and he had a couple of breezes that Bill has put into him up there. He seems like he’s responded well… So by all accounts, Bill and his team up in Saratoga have been particularly pleased with how well he’s been doing.”', 'Sovereignty posted a career-best 104 Beyer Speed Figure in that Derby triumph, which delivered Godolphin its first victory in the Run for the Roses.', 'Godolphin, a global racing outfit, has tasted victory in the Belmont Stakes before. Essential Quality — who, like Sovereignty, is a Kentucky homebred for Godolphin — won the 2021 Belmont after finishing third in that year’s Kentucky Derby.', 'This year’s shortened Belmont distance of 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga figures to work well for Sovereignty, whose three career wins have come at distances of 1 1/16 miles (twice) and 1 1/4 miles in the Derby.', '“I would anticipate that’ll be fine for him,” Banahan said of the Belmont distance for Sovereignty, who began his racing career with a fourth-place effort in a maiden special weight race at Saratoga last August. “I suppose if it was a regular Belmont at Belmont Park, that’d be another question to answer going that far (1 1/2 miles). But it certainly looks like a mile and a quarter was well in his wheelhouse in the Derby and (we) anticipate that it shouldn’t be any issue at Saratoga as well.”', 'History is on the line for Sovereignty on Saturday at Saratoga.', 'Sovereignty is aiming to become the first Kentucky Derby winner to also win the Belmont Stakes since Justify’s Triple Crown campaign in 2018.', 'Because Sovereignty didn’t compete in the Preakness Stakes, there’s also another piece of horse racing history available to him. He’s looking to become the first horse to win the Derby and the Belmont, but not the Preakness, since Thunder Gulch in 1995.', 'Only 11 horses in history have managed to win both the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, but not the Preakness Stakes, in the same year. They are Zev (1923), Twenty Grand (1931), Johnstown (1939), Shut Out (1942), Middleground (1950), Needles (1956), Chateaugay (1963), Riva Ridge (1972), Bold Forbes (1976), Swale (1984) and Thunder Gulch (1995).', 'Of course, one of the reasons Sovereignty is in this position is because of the decision to not race in the Preakness Stakes.', 'Since Justify won the Triple Crown in 2018, four of the seven horses that won the Kentucky Derby have skipped the Preakness.

That’s the same gap Sovereignty will have between the Derby and Saturday’s Belmont.', '“We looked at the opportunities that were going to present themselves for him after the Derby and we felt that the best thing for him, and to have a career through the whole season and maybe into next year as well, was spacing his races a little bit,” Banahan added. “Bill Mott, who’s trained horses for us for a long time, is very judicious about where he wants to place his horses and we put a lot of faith in the recommendations that he would give us as well.”', 'This story was originally published June 4, 2025 at 6:50 AM.', '', 'Part of the McClatchy Media Network', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVBVSGcwWmsxSVFuZzVTa2hyVFJERUF4aW5CU2dLTWdZZEU1U05FUWc=-w280-h168-p-df

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)AP', 'On the morning after Sovereignty won the Kentucky Derby, his trainer, Bill Mott checked him out. It had been a grueling race over a muddy track. The trainer discovered a small scrape about six inches along his right front pastern probably when he clipped heels with another mount coming out of the gate.', 'Mott said it was nothing serious, but anything to do with a horse’s legs is serious. He called Pimlico Race Course and scratched the horse out of the Preakness Stakes, the second stage of the Triple Crown.', 'He said they were doing it for the horse’s future. And that set off a strange gnashing of teeth among self-appointed experts, some of whom don’t know a fetlock from a pastern but clearly understand the value of their extra face time on a television screen if they shout loud enough and long enough.', 'Mott said he owed it to his horse. The windbags said he owed it to the public. The know-nothings insisted that Mott had insulted the American public by denying it the possibility of a Triple Crown winner. The horse is owned by Godolphin Stables, which, in turn, is owned by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of the ruler of Dubai and Vice President of the United Arab Emirates. Before the Derby, Godolphin was 0-for-12 in the most prestigious race in the Western Hemisphere.', 'Now a pause for a little common sense. Godolphin has never won a Triple Crown. William Mott has never won a Triple Crown. Now listen to Bob Baffert, who has won two Triple Crowns: “The Classics are still the Classics. It’s a battle of the best 3-year-old horses. I know people are disappointed, but I also know Bill Mott would love to win the Triple Crown because every trainer wants to win it. But he knows his horse well, and we have to respect that.”', 'Even for those who do not bet, there is one common ingredient that keeps the emotion alive in all sports for the American public. Every sport but one has a superstar. That means football, baseball, basketball boxing, hockey and anything else that is competitive. America always needs a superstar to love or hate. Just look what Ali and Frazier did for boxing, which had all but slipped from the public interest.', 'That’s probably the reason for this slice of America’s Triple Crown greed. It has no superstar. Don’t blame the horse or the trainer. It’s the money, stupid. Blame the self-serving owners. You can’t have a superstar if he ain’t there. What great horse is not retired after his 3-year old season? He brings in so much more in stud fees.', 'The proof was a wonder horse named Kelso, a maternal grandson of Triple Crown champion Count Fleet. Before he set foot on a track, owner Allaire du Pont had him gelded in hopes of calming him down. Although he was five times Horse of the Year, the one thing he wasn’t was calmed. Nobody can think like a horse but personally I believe the reason he ran so ferociously was that he was pissed off at missing out on the joy of life on a stud farm.', 'But to return to the race that Sovereignty never ran, listen to Michael McCarthy, whose Preakness winner, Journalism, was second in the slop at the Derby.', '“It’s not a simple decision. It’s easy to say the sporting decision is to run in all three and try to win the Triple Crown. It is not meant to be easy. I don’t know the reason behind Mott’s decision, but I can tell you nobody who knows Bill Mott questions it. It’s his horse and his decision.”', 'Ever sinceSovereignty didn’t run in the Preakness, there have been conversations about spreading out the three legs beyond the current gap of two weeks, then three weeks.', 'But even with a freshened Sovereignty set for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, the railbirds in Saratoga are busy doing what they always do.

We only recommend products we believe in.', 'The Belmont Stakes, the final leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown, is set for June 7, 2025, at Saratoga Race Course. This year’s race, shortened to 1 1/4 miles due to construction at Belmont Park, promises excitement with a field of eight talented three-year-olds. Favorites like Journalism and Sovereignty dominate the headlines, but longshots Hill Road and Crudo could steal the show. Why should you consider these underdogs? Their recent performances, pedigrees, and connections suggest they offer serious value for bettors looking to score big.', 'History shows the Belmont Stakes is a haven for longshots. The grueling distance and unique track conditions often favor horses with less hype but strong fundamentals. In 2002, Sarava stunned at 70-1 odds, denying War Emblem a Triple Crown. Birdstone, at 36-1, upset Smarty Jones in 2004. These examples prove that overlooking longshots can mean missing out on massive payouts. Hill Road and Crudo, with odds of 10-1 and 15-1 respectively, fit the profile of horses capable of outrunning their price tags.', 'Hill Road, trained by Chad Brown, is a late-running colt with a knack for finishing strong. His recent win in the Peter Pan Stakes, a key Belmont prep race, showcased his potential. Despite a moderate pace, he rallied from behind to win by three-quarters of a length, earning a career-best 94 Beyer Speed Figure. His pedigree, sired by Quality Road, suggests he can handle the 1 1/4-mile distance.', 'Why does Hill Road stand out? His connections are top-notch. Brown, a five-time Eclipse Award winner, has a history of success with European imports like Hill Road, who began his career on turf in Ireland. Jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., a five-time Eclipse Award winner, takes the reins. Ortiz’s ability to navigate Saratoga’s track could be key, especially from Hill Road’s No. 1 post position, which allows him to save ground early. If the pace heats up, Hill Road’s closing style could make him a factor in the stretch.', 'Crudo, at 15-1, brings a different dynamic to the Belmont Stakes. Trained by Todd Pletcher, a four-time Belmont winner, this colt is a front-runner with serious upside. Owned partly by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, Crudo is sired by Justify, the 2018 Triple Crown champion. His recent performances scream potential. After a fourth-place debut, he dominated a maiden race at Keeneland by 7 1/4 lengths. On Preakness Day, he crushed the Sir Barton Stakes by 7 1/2 lengths, showing he can handle pressure on the lead.', 'What makes Crudo intriguing? His ability to set the pace could exploit a field with limited early speed. With only Rodriguez as another confirmed front-runner, Crudo might dictate terms. Jockey John Velazquez, a Hall of Famer with two Belmont wins, adds confidence. From the No. 5 post, Crudo has tactical flexibility. If he gets a clean lead, he could be tough to catch, especially if favorites like Journalism falter late.', '', '', 'Betting on longshots requires strategy. Here’s how to evaluate Hill Road and Crudo for your wagering:', 'Can longshots really win the Belmont Stakes?\nYes, history proves it. Sarava (70-1 in 2002), Birdstone (36-1 in 2004), and Da’ Tara (38-1 in 2008) all defied the odds. The Belmont’s distance and smaller field create opportunities for underdogs.', 'How do I use Hill Road and Crudo in exotic bets?\nPair them with favorites in exactas (e.g., Journalism/Hill Road) or trifectas (e.g., Sovereignty/Crudo/Hill Road). This balances risk and reward, leveraging their high odds.', 'What makes Hill Road and Crudo different from other longshots?\nTheir recent wins, elite trainers, and top jockeys set them apart. Unlike unproven longshots like Uncaged (30-1), they have momentum and strong connections.', 'Betting on the Belmont Stakes should be fun, not stressful. Manage your bankroll wisely to stay in control. Set a budget before you bet and stick to it. For example, if you allocate $100, split it across win, place, and exotic bets to diversify risk. Never chase losses by betting more than you can afford. Spread your wagers—consider small bets on Hill Road and Crudo for value, paired with safer bets on favorites. Check track conditions and odds shifts on race day to make informed decisions. If betting feels overwhelming, take a break. Responsible gambling keeps the thrill alive without the regret.

A Triple Crown winner is not in the cards this year after two different horses won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, but the 2025 Belmont Stakes field is still loaded with intriguing storylines. Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty and Preakness winner Journalism are among the 2025 Belmont Stakes horses set to enter the starting gates for the 7:04 p.m. ET post time on Saturday. Other notable 2025 Belmont Stakes contenders include Baeza (4-1) and Rodriguez (6-1). The betting favorite has won the Belmont Stakes 42% of the time (66 of 156), and four of the last seven winners have been favorites. With so much to consider while making your 2025 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.', 'The Belmont Stakes is the oldest and longest race of the Triple Crown series, having been run at 1.5 miles since 1926.

The field is generally the smallest of the three classic horse races due to contenders getting weeded out in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The ""Test of the Champion"" requires a blend of talent and stamina, with just 13 horses cementing their place in history as Triple Crown champions. There have been 23 horses who have won the Derby and Preakness before failing in the Belmont Stakes, but there is no Triple Crown on the line this year. ', ""Given all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in a Belmont Stakes like this, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2025 Belmont Stakes picks possible."", ""A fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling hit the top three finishers at the Kentucky Derby in the correct order and then nailed the exacta in this year's Preakness Stakes.
