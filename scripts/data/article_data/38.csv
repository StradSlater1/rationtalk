The Straßenversion is back! Porsche makes a street-legal 963 Le Mans hypercar,https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/porsche/963-rsp/,"['► Street-legal 963 revealed\n► Based on the ‘Count Rossi’ 917 from ‘75\n► On display at Le Mans and Goodwood', 'You’re looking at the Porsche 963 RSP, a one-off special of Stuttgart’s IMSA-and WEC-winning hypercar that’s been made road-legal. Revealed today at the Circuit de Sarthe ahead of the Le Mans endurance race next week – it’s also a throwback to the ‘Count Rossi’ 917. ', 'Known as Chassis 30 in Zuffenhausen, the ‘Count Rossi’ was a 917 that was driven from the factory to Paris by an owner that insisted it was adapted for the road as little as possible. It’s that silver racer that this 963 RSP is the spiritual successor to. ', '', 'As for the RSP part? That’s short for Roger S. Penske. The car was also the work of Porsche AG, Porsche Penske Motorsport and Porsche Cars North America. ', '‘That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,’ said Porsche works driver, Timo Bernhard, after driving the car for the first time on a public road. ‘The car behaved perfectly, it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 – I felt super special and a lot more comfortable especially as I want not needing all my safety gear.’ ', '', 'The Count Rossi’s changes were minimal, but a lot has happened in the 50 years since – and that means the 963 RSP is different beast to the Porsche hypercar you’ll see racing. It’s the first 963 car to be painted – tricky given the patchwork of Kevlar and carbonfibre that makes up a modern racecar – and it’s been finished in a classic Martini Silver like the original car. ', 'Inside you get tan leather and Alcantara which is a little nicer than the real thing, and the bodywork has also been tweaked to further channel the 917. There are new front vents, period-accurate Michelin logos, forged OZ-racing wheels and an enamel Porsche logo. Blanking plates on the rear wing – required for the racing car – have been removed, too. ', '', 'Engine-wise, it keeps the same 4.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 as the racecar, and there’s no mention of any detuning. In the same way, the hybrid system and Xtrac ‘box appear untouched. It’s the Count Rossi way, after all. ', 'The skateboard-stiff suspension has also been changed, however; ride height has been increased and its Multimatic dampers have been calibrated to the softest possible level – so it’ll easier for the 963 to contend with the rougher roads and streets around Le Mans. A horn, numberplate and special Michelin tyres keep the gendarme away.', '', 'You’ll be able to see this car on display during the Le Mans race week, but also at Goodwood later this year.', 'Curtis Moldrich is CAR magazine’s Digital Editor and has worked for the brand for the past five years. He’s responsible for online strategy, including CAR’s website, social media channels such as X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, and helps on wider platform strategy as CAR magazine branches out on to Apple News+ and more.', 'By Curtis Moldrich', ""CAR's Digital Editor, F1 and sim-racing enthusiast.

Porsche Is Teasing Us With Glimpses of a One-of-One Hypercar Called 963 RSP,https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a64919361/porsche-teaser-one-of-one-hypercar-963-rsp/,"['One month after teasing a 963 road car, another short video suggests the debut of a one-off Le Mans racer for the street may be imminent.', ""Last month, Porsche shared a video celebrating the one-off road-going 917 prototype of the 1970s. That ended with a silhouette of the brand's current 963 prototype, teasing a potential road-going variant of that car. On Thursday, the brand went one step further with another teaser video — one suggesting a reveal of a one-off 963 road car could be imminent."", ""The video names the car as the Porsche 963 RSP, a curious name that falls outside of the automaker's typical collection of abbreviations. It shows craftsmen in Porsche Classic-branded uniforms sanding down carbon fiber fenders, ratcheting on bodywork, cutting materials, and preparing paint for what appears to be a variant of the 963 race car currently running in both the IMSA GTP and FIA World Endurance Championship Hypercar classes. The video ends with a look at a real Porsche badge being placed on the car and another physical badge with the 963 RSP model designation on the rear light bar."", ""But returning to that unusual name for a moment: it's worth pointing out that Penske Porsche Motorsport team owner and Porsche racing factory partner Roger Penske's middle name is Seale. Penske, arguably the most successful individual team owner in auto racing history, operates the factory program that won four of five possible championships across the 2024 IMSA and FIA WEC seasons. If Porsche were to give one outside customer a road-going 963, Penske would make sense as the most likely owner."", 'Whether or not the car is being prepared for Roger Penske, we know that it is a one-off. The brand\'s YouTube video description refers to the 963 RSP as a ""one-of-one vehicle,"" suggesting that this is a single example built for something very specific, rather than a concept for a future limited production offering. We should see the car around the 2025 24 Hours of Le Mans; that race is set for June 14th, so the car should be revealed at some point in the next two weeks.', '', ""Fred Smith's love of cars comes from his fascination with auto racing.

One Man Got A New Porsche Hypercar No One Else Ever Will,https://www.carscoops.com/2025/06/porsche-road-legal-race-car-one-off-hypercar/,"['The one-off Porsche 963 RSP was made for American businessman, former racing driver and current team owner Roger S. Penske', 'The age of hybrid hypercars hasn’t exactly delivered a spiritual successor to the Porsche 918 Spyder, at least, not one extreme enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with the McLaren P1 or Ferrari F80. While the world waits for that new “holy trinity” to form, something entirely unexpected has emerged: a street-legal version of the Porsche 963 LMDh race car, the same one that’s conquered both IMSA and WEC championships.', 'More: Porsche Made One Of These Street-Legal Beasts And It’s Still Daily Driven', 'It’s called the 963 RSP, and before you go looking for your checkbook, know this: it’s a one-off. Not a homologation special like the 911 GT1 Strassenversion. Just one. The idea came from Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America, who pitched it as a tribute to the Count Rossi 917, the legendary race car that was made roadworthy five decades ago.', 'A Tribute with Pedigree', 'If you’re wondering what RSP stands for, those initials belong to Roger S. Penske. Yes, that Roger Penske. The 88-year old billionaire and former racing driver who also happens to own Team Penske, the outfit that runs Porsche’s 963s in IMSA and WEC. He was “nominated as the customer for the car,” which is a polite way of saying: when you help bring Porsche championships, you get one-of-a-kind toys.', 'Making a Race Car Behave in Traffic', 'The design brief was simple: stay as close to the race car as possible, with nods to the Count Rossi 917. The bodywork, made from carbon fiber and Kevlar, keeps the silhouette intact but gains extra coverage over the wheel arches. A few exterior details help set it apart, including new fender vents, a reworked rear wing minus the blanking plates, and a proper enamel Porsche crest on the nose.', 'Unlike its counterparts which are wrapped in racing liveries, the 963 RSP is painted in a special Martini Silver shade, tastefully combined with a few satin black accents.', 'Step inside and it’s clear this isn’t your average stripped-out racer. The cabin is wrapped in tan leather and Alcantara, another nod to the Count Rossi car. The carbon seats come straight from the race version but are softened with handcrafted upholstery, fixed headrests, and actual padding. The footwells and roofliner are trimmed in Alcantara too, while the steering wheel and door panels are leather-wrapped.', 'Creature comforts are predictably sparse. You get a detachable 3D-printed cupholder and a small trimmed panel next to the driver’s seat, which Porsche suggests using for a laptop, helmet, or removable steering wheel. Even the air vents get special treatment, as they’re shaped like the fan blades from the 917’s engine. Finally, there is an alloy plaque on the door with the vehicle’s chassis number alongside the date and location of construction.', 'And because no Porsche tribute would be complete without accessories, the car comes with a custom-painted helmet and a Snap-On toolset with leather-wrapped handles. Naturally.', 'A Slightly Tamed Beast Is Still A Beast', 'The one-off 963 RSP rides on 18-inch forged wheels by OZ, wrapped in rain-spec Michelin tires which provide more grip than the racing slicks. Engineers have increased the ground clearance, and chose the softer available setting for the adjustable Multimatic DSSV dampers. Furthermore, they installed a horn, mounting points for license plates on both ends, and tweaked the software for the headlights and taillights to allow for the use of turn signals.', 'The hybrid V8 powertrain and seven-speed sequential gearbox from Xtrac have been carried over directly from the race car, though not without a few essential tweaks. The rear-mounted electric motor and generator were remapped to deliver power more smoothly, while the mid-mounted, twin-turbo 4.6-liter V8, which is good for around 671 hp (500 kW / 680 PS), has been reconfigured to run on standard pump gas.', 'Notably, Porsche hasn’t said a word about changes to the exhaust, which suggests this one-off might still sound like it’s doing laps at Daytona even when it’s just rolling through town.', 'All of these modifications earned the 963 RSP special permission from French authorities to be driven on public roads. That said, it’s not fully homologated. The car is only allowed on the street “under special circumstances and in accordance with local requirements.” In other words, don’t expect Roger Penske to be running errands in it anytime soon.', 'Three-time Le Mans winner Timo Bernhard, who had the chance to drive the one-off on public roads next to the Circuit de la Sarthe, said: “That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime. Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me – it felt unreal. The car behaved perfectly – it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 – and felt super special and a lot more comfortable, especially as I was not needing all my safety gear.”', 'Can’t They Make Another One For Me?', 'Porsche hasn’t said what it cost to build the 963 RSP, but it’s safe to assume the price tag could buy you a few dozen Taycans. Not that it matters, since Porsche won’t be making another. Still, you can bet collectors would empty their bank accounts and happily slap their initials on the tail if given the chance.', 'For now, the one-off is on display at the Circuit de la Sarthe for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After the race, it’s heading back to the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart for a short stay before making its way to the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it will appear alongside the original 917.', '', 'Google News', 'MSN Start', 'Thanos Pappas, a product design engineer by trade, has been wading through automotive journalism for...

So well, that 162 years and several generations later their heirs would have more money than they knew what to do with.', 'One heir, Count Gregorio Rossi di Montelera, knew what to do with it: He went racing. Like his familial predecessor Count Metello Rossi di Montelera, who first put the family colors on a race car in 1958, the later Count Rossi saw Martini & Rossi colors on race cars at Le Mans, in WRC, and in Formula 1.', 'Some of the most well-known liveries appeared on Porsche 917s, including one that took first place at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1971.', 'But that wasn’t enough for this Count. So he made a special deal with Porsche in 1974 to build a road-legal 917 that he then drove the following year from Stuttgart to Paris on public roads—with a US license plate from Alabama because that was apparently the only place in the world that would legally certify such a car for the street. Sweet Home Alabama!', 'Now, 51 years after Count Rossi’s audacious journey, Porsche has conspired with Penske Racing to create another Le Mans racer for the street in the 963 RSP you see here.', 'Keen readers already noted the car’s initials—RSP—stand for Roger Searle Penske, who is no stranger to Porsche race cars.', '“This really started out as a ‘what if?’—a passion project by a small team of enthusiasts at Penske and at Porsche who together imagined a version of the 963 that really resembled as closely as possible the spirit and appearance of the Count Rossi 917,” said Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch, who conceived of the original idea.', '', '“The 917 from the story was every inch a race car—albeit one driven on the road—and we took the same approach with the 963 RSP.

The number 963 is 962 + 1, the successor both numerically and spiritually to the great 962, 956, and 917 that have won Le Mans 19 times.', 'This road-going 963 is painted silver like Count Rossi’s car was 50 years ago and features uniquely altered bodywork and a bespoke tan leather and Alcantara interior inspired by the trim choices made by Count Rossi.', '“A dedicated mechanical and electronic setup were configured for its debut on the streets near Le Mans—including a raised ride height and softened dampers, as well as a reprogrammed control unit to allow for the headlights and taillights to operate closer to those of a road car,” Porsche said. “These changes along with modified bodywork to cover the wheel arches, the use of Michelin wet weather compound tires, and even the fitment of a horn meant the car met the necessary criteria to be allowed to drive on the road and wear license plates under special permission from the French authorities and with the enthusiastic support of the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), which runs the 24 Hours of Le Mans race.”', 'Instead of a Rossi heir, the 963 was driven down the streets of Le Mans by Porsche racer Timo Bernhard, who enjoyed the journey.', '', '“That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,” said Bernhard, who was at the wheel of the 963 RSP for its first miles on the road. “Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me—it felt unreal.

With such a remarkable partnership continuing to this day, we felt it was time to create the most exciting car we could imagine. Just like the 917, I wanted this car to be authentic to its origin and have as few changes to it as possible. When we got into the project, the differences in the two generations of race cars provided a great challenge. What emerged is a car that has lost none of its edge and is exciting whether on the track or on the road.”', 'The car came from Porsche’s Sonderwunsch, or Special Wish division, Stuttgart’s customization program. A Sonderwunsch team worked at Porsche Classic in Atlanta—a standalone facility opened in 2023. To align with Count Rossi’s design, the team added fender vents, removed carbon fiber blanking plates from the rear wing, and added an enamel Porsche badge similar to that of the 917. Even the tire sidewalls get 1970s-era Michelin logos. It rolls on rain-spec 18-inch tires over forged OZ racing wheels.

These are extremely complicated cars, with complex high-voltage hybrid powertrains that take entire teams of engineers just to operate. And road use would have never been in the original design brief for the 963. The car is incredibly low to optimize mechanical and aerodynamic grip, and while these race cars are incredibly safe, road-car safety standards are entirely different.

Penske-owned teams have claimed championships in IndyCar, IMSA, the FIA World Endurance Championship, NASCAR, Trans-Am, Can-Am, and V8 Supercars, not to mention a record 20 wins in the Indianapolis 500. His latest honor is something completely different: The right to own the only road-going variant of Porsche's 963 race car ever built."", '', 'Yes, Porsche actually built a road car based on the 963 race car. Dubbed the 963 RSP in honor of its eventual owner — the ""S"" stands for Searle — the new road-going hypercar features the same twin-turbocharged V-8 and Bosch hybrid unit featured in the race car, producing around 680 horsepower.', ""Porsche says that the car underwent a few mechanical changes, most notably a new engine mapping that allows the 918 Spyder-derived racing motor to run on pump gas. The engine remains in a standard race tune otherwise, although the hybrid system's MGU unit has been adjusted to provide power more smoothly for better-optimized road driving. The car also has a taller ride height, adjustable head lights, functional turn signals, and racing Multimatic DSSV dampers adjusted to their softest settings."", '', ""The biggest changes from the race car are the adjustments made to build something more like a road car than a race car inside and out. Porsche's Sonderwunsch team — the same group that generally builds one-offs based on more conventional road cars — chose to paint the car rather than wrapping it, as teams do when finishing modern race cars. Minor bodywork changes include closed fender vents, a removed rear wing blanking plate, mounting points for license plates, and physical brand and model badges."", ""Porsche says that the car is meant to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Count Rossi's famous road-going 917, something first teased when the car was hinted at back in April. The same silver and black color palette from that car was selected for the 963 RSP, headlined by a Porsche Museum-verified paint-to-sample shade the brand is calling Martini Silver."", '', 'Inside, tan leather and Alcantara trim cover elements that are generally bare carbon fiber in the racing 963. New comfort elements include places to put a headset and a helmet, a spot for a laptop needed to start the car, and, most uniquely, a removable cupholder that can hold a Porsche-branded travel mug.', 'The one-off will surely lead to plenty of calls to Porsche\'s Sonderwunsch division asking for more 963 one-offs, but at the moment, the brand seems content to make just one.

While it wasn't entirely clear why Porsche was bringing attention to this undeniably cool piece of automotive history, a video released at the time hinted that Porsche was cooking up something special.

We're not entirely sure what RSP stands for, as this moniker has never been used in Porsche's illustrious and alphanumeric-filled past. Our friends over at Road & Track pointed out that those letters match the initials of Roger Penske (whose middle name is Searle), the motorsports mogul who owns the team that operates Porsche's factory endurance racing program and has seen massive success in both IMSA and the FIA World Endurance Championship."", ""In the video, we see Porsche workers handcrafting the 963 RSP, presented in an ASMR-style format. The workers cut and sew upholstery, sand down carbon-fiber body panels, and mix paint. We also see the employees attaching a real Porsche badge to what appears to be the car's hood, an important distinction since the real race car wears the Porsche crest as a sticker to save weight and improve aerodynamics."", ""No details were provided about the 963 RSP, other than the fact that only one will be built.

Porsche previews one-off 963 'RSP',https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-germancars/porsche-previews-one-off-963-rsp/49903,"['By Matt Bird / Thursday, 29 May 2025 / 17 comments', 'Rumours have swirled for a little while now, thanks to a video teaser, that Porsche is creating a road-legal version of its 963 sportscar racer. Now, just a couple of weeks from Le Mans, Porsche has published another few seconds on YouTube that make clear a very special 963 is coming. ', 'It’s called the 963 RSP - see the badge at the end - described by Porsche as ‘a one-of-one vehicle crafted with precision, purpose and detail at every touchpoint.’ So that’s exactly what we see in the video, Porsche Classic employees carefully polishing, stitching, cutting and crafting. ', 'It’s about as far away from the hustle and bustle of motorsport as it’s possible to be. Racing cars don’t get leather, polished badges or suede, either - this is something very different to the regular 963. Put simply, it looks an awful lot like Porsche is preparing a version of its hugely successful Le Mans Daytona Hybrid for road use. Or use away from the white heat of competition, at least. Which would be awesome. ', 'It evokes the glory days of GT1 to some extent, where in a few cases - think Toyota GT-One, most famously - just a couple of cars were made that could ostensibly be used on the road for homologation purposes. Back in the ‘90s, Porsche made 21 911 GT1 Strassenversions to homologate the 1998 race car. There’s no such requirement this time around, though it’s hard not to look through the back catalogue when Porsche is apparently doing something so audacious. ', 'As for the name, it’s been suggested that ‘RSP’ might stand for Roger Searle Penske, the legendary American racer and owner of Team Penske, which has been running the factory-entered Porsche 963s in WEC and IMSA. Achieving some incredible success in the process, too, including four championship wins across the two competitions in 2024. There was a Drivers’ Championship for a Penske 963 in the World Endurance Championship, the Kévin Estre/André Lotterer/Laurens Vanthoor car taking five podiums in eight events. The IMSA showing for the Penske Porsches was even more impressive, securing the Drivers, Manufacturers and Teams titles. ', 'If there’s a man that’s earned a one-off Porsche, then, it’s probably Mr Penske. From partnering up in CanAm 50 years ago to race the wild 917/30 to the beautiful DHL Porsche Penske Racing RS Spyders of the ‘00s, it’s hard to imagine Porsche sportscar racing without his involvement.

"How Porsche Built the Absurd 963 RSP, a Road-Legal Le Mans Hypercar for Today",https://www.thedrive.com/news/how-porsche-built-the-absurd-963-rsp-a-road-legal-le-mans-hypercar-for-today,"['ADAM ISMAIL', 'Published Jun 6, 2025 7:00 AM EDT', 'Get The Drive’s daily newsletter', 'The latest car news, reviews, and features.', 'Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.', 'Thirty years ago, the sorts of cars that won Le Mans and the ones you could legally drive through Mulsanne after the race could be more or less the same. Today’s “Le Mans Hypercars” bear a faint link, if any at all, to a product someone could actually buy. But Porsche has dreamt big for its latest one-off, a project it’s been teasing for months. What if its modern 963 was road-legal? What if, in the spirit of Count Rossi’s Martini Silver 917, it could legally grace public roads? How would it look? How would it smell? (The answer, we’re told, is “very good.”) The Porsche 963 RSP saves us the guesswork.', 'First things first: Yes, this silver 963 is road-legal, under specific conditions, in France. It wears French manufacturer plates and race-spec wet-weather tires. Second, it is a true 963; Porsche completed this chassis last December and even secured approval and encouragement from the FIA and IMSA that it was effectively unleashing an endurance prototype on the street. And third, the car is named after its owner: Roger Searle Penske.', 'Indeed, the American motorsports magnate who runs the factory team that fields the 963 in competitions around the world will be the owner of this truly bespoke car. Penske hasn’t taken delivery of it yet—that’ll happen in August, at Monterey Car Week—but Porsche says he has provided direction throughout the project, and if the 963 RSP is to contest any track records in the future, it’ll be up to him.', 'The 963 RSP hasn’t even been nine months in the making, and the outdoor shots of the car you see here were literally snapped this morning. This car photographer’s brief Instagram video was the first image of the car online.', 'It all began with a small meeting on October 12 of last year, during Petit Le Mans. Timo Resch, the CEO of Porsche Cars North America, defines it as a “submarine project,” a German phrase for something developed in secret, with the work limited to as few people as possible. The RSP was always intended to be a one-off, rather than part of a series of road-legal 963s—an experiment to envision a modern equivalent to the lone road-registered 917.', 'Work began with Porsche Penske Motorsport completing a fresh 963 at its facility in Mannheim, Germany, with an attention to fit and finish that LMDh Program Director Urs Kuratle said normally wouldn’t be lavished on a competition chassis. From there, the car was shipped to Atlanta to be finished, inside and out, by Ralf Strack’s Sonderwunsch (Special Request) team at Porsche Classic.', 'Unlike any other 963, the RSP is painted, not wrapped, in a shade of silver identical to the Count Rossi car’s; it also wears an enamel Porsche badge. Painting alone was a unique challenge for the team, as the 963’s body is composed mostly of raw carbon fiber, along with some Kevlar and metal—rough surfaces that take considerably more prep work and careful application to achieve a consistent, high-quality finish. Inside, the normally spartan 963 interior is now draped in Alcantara and leather; it’s also a little less cramped, because this particular 963 won’t be fighting for any podiums.', '“When it comes to the interior, you know there’s scrutineering systems, there’s marshaling displays, there’s a lot of other systems that are in there that aren’t necessarily critical,” Porsche Penske Motorsport Managing Director Jonathan Diuguid said. “Obviously, the car will still be safe and those kinds of things, but we can take them out and make it a little more comfortable.”', 'That’s why you’ll notice, among other things, a 3D-printed cupholder in this 963. (Fun fact: It can even fit Porsche’s own jumbo travel mug.) The race car’s snorkel ventilation has been replaced with a typical circular vent that evokes the cooling fan mounted on the 917’s flat-12 engine. There are also headphones, and even the formula-style steering wheel has been festooned with caramel leather grips. The plurality of leather in this thing is a touch of luxury that strikes more than one sense at a time.', '“It’s not only the look [of the interior]—it’s also the smell,” Strack emphasized. “If you open up the door—even the door is not completely sealed, it’s a race car—but still, if you open it, the smell that comes out of the small cabin, it’s amazing. I like the smell. Anytime I open up the door, I get a big smile on my face.”', 'Outside, the 963 RSP doesn’t deviate too dramatically from its racing counterpart, though there are differences if you know where to look. Normally, Le Mans Hypercars have holes in the bodywork over the wheels; these exist to relieve the pressure that causes cars to flip in a crash. There’s no need for them on the RSP, so those have been covered to achieve a sleeker profile. On the other hand, the blanking plates behind the rear wheels, intended to stop stones and other debris from flinging onto following cars, have been removed to offer a rare, unobstructed view into the back of the car. And, for a finishing touch, there’s now a 963 RSP badge fixed to the taillight bar.', 'Mechanically, this is a 963, full-stop. Power comes from a 4.6-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 making 670 horsepower, supplemented by a 67-hp MGU-K electric motor, as all LMDh cars have. The class typically mandates when and under what conditions the hybrid system’s full power can be deployed, but Diuguid said that’s been simplified for road use, for the RSP. It can run on electric power alone if needed, and even accepts pump gas. The ride height’s been raised as high as possible, and the dampers have been tuned to their softest setting, similarly to how they’d be adjusted for the bumpiest circuits in the U.S., like Sebring.', 'Take all that into consideration, and the 963 RSP is even more of a road-going race car than, say, the 911 GT1 Strassenversion was. Those old homologation specials were often detuned for emissions reasons, among other things. In contrast, the RSP, being one-of-a-kind, has an emission exemption from the EPA here in the States, and has been allowed on French roads just in time for the 24 Hours of Le Mans next week.', 'Porsche is clear: The RSP is not a series production car, and you will never see another 963 in the Count Rossi style, with these legal clearances, sold to a private buyer. However, while Kuratle said there are currently no plans to build a second road-spec 963, he also left the door open for the future. “Never say never. As Porsche, we like to sell cars, first of all, and if there is an opportunity, possibility to do it again, on a later stage, why not?”', 'Got tips?

Porsche 963 RSP (2025),https://www.netcarshow.com/porsche/2025-963_rsp/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'As Porsche prepares for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a sister to the 963 Hypercar has been revealed - named the 963 RSP. An extreme one-off based on the IMSA championship and WEC championship winning machine, the car closely follows the design direction taken by a very special 917 50 years ago. Fittingly, it made its debut today on the streets near the Circuit de la Sarthe alongside the car that inspired its creation.', 'The work of a team from Porsche AG, Porsche Penske Motorsport and Porsche Cars North America in partnership with motorsport legend Roger Penske, whose initials form the name of the car, the 963 RSP was influenced by the trailblazing 917 and an audacious drive that took place half a century ago.', 'In April 1975, a 917 (chassis 30) - the most advanced endurance race car at that time - made an extraordinary journey, not on the track, but on public roads. From the factory in Zuffenhausen, it travelled to Paris - at the wheel was its enigmatic owner, who insisted on as few changes as possible to the car, which remains in France, and on the road, to this day.', '""This really started out as a ""what if?"" - a passion project by a small team of enthusiasts at Penske and at Porsche who together imagined a version of the 963 that really resembled as closely as possible the spirit and appearance of the Count Rossi 917,"" said Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch, who conceived of the original idea. ""The 917 from the story was every inch a race car - albeit one driven on the road - and we took the same approach with the 963 RSP. It uses beautiful materials of the best quality available, but is still every bit a race car underneath.""', 'The 963 RSP features significant changes over the car on which it is based. Unlike the competition race cars, which are wrapped in different colours, the 963 RSP is the first of its kind to be painted; a unique challenge due to the nature of the carbon fibre and Kevlar® bodywork which is ultra-thin in places to save weight. In a nod to the Count Rossi 917, the 963 RSP is finished in Martini Silver and features uniquely altered bodywork and a bespoke tan leather and Alcantara interior inspired by the trim choices made by Count Rossi 50 years ago.', ""A dedicated mechanical and electronic set-up were configured for its debut on the streets near Le Mans - including a raised ride height and softened dampers, as well as a reprogrammed control unit to allow for the headlights and taillights to operate closer to those of a road car. These changes along with modified bodywork to cover the wheel arches, the use of Michelin wet weather compound tyres and even the fitment of a horn meant the car met the necessary criteria to be allowed to drive on the road and wear number plates under special permission from the French authorities and with the enthusiastic support of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), which runs the 24 Hours of Le Mans race."", '""That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,"" said Timo Bernhard, who was at the wheel of the 963 RSP for its first miles on the road. ""Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me - it felt unreal. The car behaved perfectly - it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 - and felt super special and a lot more comfortable, especially as I was not needing all my safety gear.""', '""We have enjoyed a terrific relationship with Porsche dating back to 1972. The Porsche 917/30, in particular, was one of the greatest eras in Team Penske history with numerous wins and championships, along with the closed-course speed record set by Mark Donohue in 1975,"" said Roger Penske, Chairman of the Penske Corporation. ""With such a remarkable partnership continuing to this day, we felt it was time to create the most exciting car we could imagine. Just like the 917, I wanted this car to be authentic to its origin and have as few changes to it as possible. When we got into the project, the differences in the two generations of race cars provided a great challenge. What emerged is a car that has lost none of its edge and is exciting whether on the track or on the road.""', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNU9NbmhPVFhSUFprRjFMWEZNVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdhSmNaUUtNUWM=-w280-h168-p-df

Meet Roger Penske’s Porsche 963 RSP One-Off,https://www.hagerty.com/media/news/meet-roger-penskes-porsche-963-rsp-one-off/,"['The 2024 IMSA season came to a close on October 12 with the 12-hour Petit Le Mans at Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta. The date also marked the beginning of a scheme to create what might well be the most insane road-going Porsche in existence. (More on that “road-going” bit in a moment.)', 'After hatching the plot at Road Atlanta, a small team of folks within Porsche sat down with Roger Penske and pitched an idea to use the successful IMSA- and WEC-racing 963 as the foundation for a one-off street version—and for Penske to buy it. After all, Porsche and Penske have a storied history, and an active partnership in racing the 963. “I wasn’t sure if he was going to say, ‘don’t get me distracted from my race efforts’,” jokes Timo Resch, president and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. Turns out “The Captain” loved the idea.', '“He said that if such a car were to be done, it should stay true to the 963—the race car character should not be completely changed,” Resch says. “So, typical Roger style, it was a handshake. We agreed that this would be a project spearheaded by us together.”\n\nGiven that the initial idea of a prototype racing Porsche for the road was rooted in a 917K built in 1975 for Teofilo Guiscardo Rossi di Montelera, otherwise known as “Count Rossi,” the effort, while preserving the 963’s identity, would also be rooted in a heritage call-back. The result is the 963 RSP (for Roger Searle Penske), a subtly tweaked variation on the race car that has been kitted out just like the Count’s 917.', 'In keeping with the effort to stay as true to the race cars as possible, the RSP has not deviated much mechanically, but some key changes have been made. In particular, the suspension—though it retains the same components as the race car—has been set up to meet the different demands of driving on the road. “We race at very bumpy circuits like Long Beach and Detroit,” says Jonathan Duiguid, managing director of Porsche Penske Motorsport. “Our Multimatic DSSV dampers have quite an adjustment range. The valve settings [and ride height for the RSP] have been chosen based off our experience on the bumpiest race circuits around the world.”', 'The powertrain is similarly massaged rather than substantially modified. As in the race car, the RSP’s 4.6-liter twin-turbo V-8 cranks out about 680 horsepower and is supplemented by a 1.35 kWh battery and bellhousing-mounted motor-generator unit, and the RSP can briefly run in electric-only mode (as is done in pit lane with the race cars). The mapping of the electric power delivery, however, has been adjusted to be more manageable for road use. And the engine control tuning has been changed to accommodate 93-octane fuel.', 'Buy and sell classics with confidence', 'Freed from the rules of IMSA and WEC, the Porsche team was able to subtly adjust the body. Racing 963s have cutouts above their wheels to help evacuate air and keep the car more stable in the event the driver loses control at high speed. The RSP covers the wheels to return to a more traditional prototype look. The rear wing also lacks series-required blanking plates. Ultimately, true to Penske’s wishes, there’s no mistaking this for anything other than a 963.', 'Visually, the car leans heavily into finishes that are consistent with the 917K that inspired this endeavor. Even the Michelin logos on the tires are 1975 period-correct. Porsche says it went to great lengths to match the Martini Silver paint sample with the 917, and it was sure to point out that “all the way down to the color of the wheel nut” that secures the RSP’s black wheels, this is a reimagination of a Porsche story from 50 years ago.', 'This extends to the interior, where Ralf Strack, the manager of factory restoration at Porsche USA’s facility in Atlanta, enthusiastically shared his team’s efforts. “If you stick your head in there, you will see what I’m talking about,” says Strack. “It’s not only the look, but also the smell [of the leather].” Indeed, the makeover is pretty trick, with tan leather and Alcantara throughout, just like the 917K. Even the utilitarian, button-intensive steering wheel from the race car has been leather-wrapped and looks suitably luxurious. Strack also noted the addition of a cupholder (“As we built the car in Atlanta, home of Coke—of course the cup holder needed to fit a can of Coke”), along with little details like air vents fashioned after the air-cooled engine fans from the ’70s. Throughout our May 30 Zoom call, it became clear that Strack and his team relished the chance to do something special with the RSP.', 'At the time of our call, the RSP was headed to Weissach for a full shakedown. When pushed whether they’d share any performance numbers, the team demurred, but we have little doubt about the car’s envelope. Besides, this is more heritage project than technological tour de force.', 'As to the road-going nature of the 963 RSP: It will indeed be going on some roads, but it’s not road-legal in the same fashion as your run-of-the-mill 911. As a one-off, Porsche has attained exemptions so the 963 RSP doesn’t have to undergo the very expensive and arduous crash-test and emissions processes that regular production cars must endure. Porsche has secured permission from French authorities to drive along an agreed-upon route ahead of Le Mans, and the car will wear manufacturer plates. Likewise, it has received special exemption from the EPA (Porsche and Penske did not pursue the Show-or-Display exemption because it will not be registered, at least in the States) and will be able to drive when it heads to California for Monterey Car Week in August.', 'Would Porsche build another one? “We will not build exactly the same one again,” says Urs Kuratle, director of factory motorsport LMDh. “That’s the nature of the project… But as I said before, never say never.” With Penske’s initials in the name, it makes sense there won’t be another like this 963. One can hope, though, for similar projects down the road, if only to stoke the creative juices for folks like Strack and his team.', 'If you want to glimpse the 963 RSP in person, start booking your plane tickets, because right now, you’ve got just a few options. First up is at Le Mans, which is just a week away—it’s there that it meets up for the first time, as you see here, with the 917K that inspired it. From there, it’s off to the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, then to the Goodwood Festival of Speed from July 10 to 13, and then on to Monterey Car Week from August 8 to 17.', 'Search for prices of other cars, trucks, vans and motorcycles', 'I love it.', 'My dream car is to take a race car and make it street legal someday.', 'It’s amazing what a fat wallet and even fatter passion can do', 'Your email address will not be published.

At least, not when it comes to doing so by way of big-money, low-production special editions barely anyone will ever see in real life. Cynics will say cars like the track-only new 935 that was limited to 77 examples and priced at $800,000-plus and the 911 GT3 R Rennsport—also limited to 77 copies and priced at $1,046,000—are irrelevant to anyone but the handful of owner-collectors who get their hands on them. But that’s beside the point for car fans and dreamers who appreciate the mere existence of such near-vaporware creations. ', '', 'Whichever camp you fall into, Porsche’s latest and even more limited, more expensive salvo will have tongues wagging this summer. Say hello to the Porsche 963 RSP, a one-off road-oriented build of the company’s top-level endurance race car that competes in the Hypercar class at Le Mans and in the FIA World Endurance Championship, and in the GTP class in America’s IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship.', 'If you are unfamiliar with its bond fides, here’s the car’s resume in a nutshell since its 2023 debut in international racing competition: 10 wins and five championship titles (spread between drivers’ and constructors’ crowns), including wins at the prestigious Rolex 24 at Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring.', 'See All 23 Photos', 'Yes, this is the one and only 963 RSP Porsche will build, and those three letters tailing the car’s name identify its owner as Roger Searle Penske, the automotive-industry stalwart and eponymous owner of multiple championship-winning racing teams, the NTT IndyCar Series, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and most relevant in this context, the co-namesake of the Porsche Penske Motorsport operation that fields 963s in international sports-car competition.', 'Revealed in full today in France a week before this year’s 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 963 RSP drew some inspiration from a similar project 50 years ago, 917 chassis No. 30 that’s seen here as well. The latter car, following its racing career, was commissioned into roadgoing-spec byTeofilo Guiscardo Rossi di Montelera, aka Count Rossi.', 'According to the manufacturer, the new 963 RSP was dreamed up by Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch. Resch then met with Thomas Laudenbach, vice president of Porsche Motorsport, and Urs Kuratle, head of Porsche’s factory 963 program, with the trio eventually taking the idea to Penske.', 'See All 23 Photos', 'Obvious differences to the full-on racing version include Martini Silver paint over the carbon-fiber and Kevlar bodywork, and the interior trimmed in tan leather and Alcantara (the same colors as Rossi’s 917). Look a bit closer at some of the bodywork and you’ll see differences to the racing version, such as new fender-top vents where the standard 963 features wide-open cutouts. Carbon-fiber rear-wing blanking plates, required for racing, are deleted, and the RSP boasts an enamel Porsche badge on its nose in place of the racing version’s weight-saving and airflow-improving “sticker” badge. Peer into the cockpit and it’s amusing to spot a 3D-printed cupholder alongside the leather-trimmed racing-spec steering wheel, and likewise the vintage 1970s-style Michelin logos adorning the tire sidewalls in a nod to the 917 project.', 'Porsche, no surprise, says the car features places to install front and rear license plates, headlights and taillights programmed for road use, turn signals, a horn, lifted ride height, and the softest suspension setting available from the Multimatic DSSV racing dampers, and that it rolls on Michelin’s treaded wet-weather racing rubber rather than dry-weather slicks that aren’t allowed on open roads.', 'See All 23 Photos', 'Look inside a bit more and there are several other notable details, including a place to store the provided driver’s headset and the steering wheel when removed from its column, as well as one for resting the laptop computer needed to start the car. Porsche points out little touches like HVAC system end plates “which mimic the styling of the fan on top of the 917’s flat-12 engine.”', 'However, it’s not accurate to call this a street-legal 963, as the car hasn’t been truly homologated for road use like a series-production car, skipping costly and time-consuming endeavors like crash testing. This means Penske likely won’t be able to drive it on public streets whenever he wants, instead requiring special dispensation from local authorities to demonstrate it at specific times and places. If the Captain, as he is well known, takes the car to his metro-Detroit home, for instance, showing it off during an event like the annual Woodward Dream Cruise might be on the cards—but don’t expect to spot it in a Kroger parking lot.', 'That doesn’t mean enthusiasts won’t be able to cast their eyes on the 963 RSP before Penske takes delivery of it during August’s Monterey Car Week. Porsche plans to display it throughout the 24 Hours of Le Mans at the Circuit de la Sarthe and will subsequently move it to the company’s official museum in Stuttgart, Germany, before sending if off to July’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. ', 'See All 23 Photos', 'As for performance, the Porsche 963 RSP retains the racer’s hybrid twin-turbo 4.6-liter V-8 power unit (itself derived from the engine used first in the RS Spyder race car of the mid-2000s before being adapted for road use in the 918 Spyder street car), and while the company says it is not detuned or modified from the modern race car’s, it did revise the hybrid system’s motor generator unit (MGU) mapping to deliver smoother operation on the street than is needed for racing. Oh, and the whole thing is now able to run on fuel from the nearest gas station rather than strictly racing-grade petrol.', 'Porsche cites a peak output of about 680 horsepower, funneled to the wheels through seven-speed Xtrac sequential transmission.That might not sound like much relative to the output of many of today’s hypercars and EVs, but keep in mind this car weighs approximately just 2,300–2,400 pounds. For comparison, the new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid we tested recently weighs 3,598 pounds and accelerated from 0–60 mph in 2.6 seconds and covered the quarter mile in 10.7 seconds at 129.7 mph. Its peak horsepower? 532.', 'In terms of the overall 800-volt hybrid tech, Porsche says the 1.35-KWh battery can provide between 30–50 kilowatts in short blasts at the push of a button that “does not change the overall output of the powertrain. When the thrust of the MGU kicks in, the power of the combustion engine, which can reach over 8,000 rpm ... automatically decreases.” This is a function of the “balance of performance rules” governing sports car racing. ', 'As a one-off creation, Porsche hasn’t supplied a price or value for the 963 RSP, but since the raw racing version starts at about $2.9 million, it’s not a stretch to imagine all the work that went into this car easily puts it at the $3.5 million mark, or more. That’s certainly beside the point, though, at least to the dreamers among us. But if you’re listening, Porsche, and speaking of the least you could do: How about putting the 963 RSP into a racing video game/simulation so the rest of us can have a chance to experience it in some capacity beyond staring at it in a museum or on a car show lawn?', 'Can Our Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Keep Up With Jeeps in Moab?', '12 Revivals of Classic Automotive Nameplates That Fell Flat', ""Congratulations to the Chevrolet Colorado, MotorTrend's 2024 Truck of the Year"", 'Only One? The Porsche 963 RSP Is a Modern Le Mans Race Car for the Road', ""Volvo Invented a Safety Device You Use Every Day—and Now It's Improving It"", 'I’m not sure if this is bizarre, amusing, interesting, or none of those, but I remember picking up the inaugural issue of Automobile from the magazine rack at a Meijer grocery store in metro Detroit. At 9 years old in 1986, I was already a devoted consumer of car magazines, and this new one with the funky font on the cover caught my eye immediately. Longtime Automobile editor and present-day contributor Michael Jordan despises this story, but I once used his original review of Ferrari’s F40 as source material for a fifth-grade research project. I still have the handwritten report on a shelf at home. Sometimes I text MJ pictures of it — just to brighten his day. I’ve always been a car fan, but I never had any grand dreams, schemes, or plans of making it onto this publication’s masthead. I did earn a journalism degree from Michigan State University but at the time never planned to use it for its intended purpose. Law school made more sense to me for some reason. And then, thankfully, it didn’t. I blame two dates for this: May 1 and May 29, 1994. The former was the day Formula 1 star Ayrton Senna died. As a kid, I’d seen him race years earlier on the streets of Detroit, and though I didn’t follow F1 especially closely, the news of his demise shocked me. It’s the only story I remember following in the ensuing weeks, which just happened to lead right into the latter date. By pure chance, I had earlier accepted a friend’s invitation to accompany him and his father to the Indy 500. You’ve probably heard people say nothing prepares you for the sight of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, especially in real life on race day, with more than 250,000 spectators on the ground. It sounds like clichéd hyperbole, but it’s true. And along with my renewed interest in F1 in the wake of Senna’s death, that first encounter with Indy ignited a passion for motorsports I never expected to find. Without charting the entire course here, the upshot is that it led me to a brief stint working at a racing school, and then to Autoweek, where I worked as a full-time staffer for 13 years, the majority of them as motorsports editor. I was also a tester and reviewer of road cars, a fleet manager, and just about everything in between that is commonplace at automotive enthusiast outlets. Eventually, my work there led me to Automobile in early 2015 — almost 29 years to the day that I first picked up that funky new car mag as my mom checked-off her grocery list. What else do you probably not want to know? I — along with three other people, I’m told frequently — am an avid NBA fan, evidenced by a disturbingly large number of Nikes taking up almost all of my closet space. I enjoy racing/driving video games and simulators, though for me they’ll never replace the real thing. Road cars are cool, race cars are better. I’ve seen the original “Point Break” at least 147 times start to finish. I’ve seen “Top Gun” even more. The millennials on our staff think my favorite decade is the ’80s. They’re wrong. It’s the ’90s. I always have too many books to read and no time to do so. Despite the present histrionics, I do not believe fully autonomous cars will dominate our roads any time soon, probably not for decades. I used to think anyone who didn’t drive a manual transmission wasn’t a real driver, but I was wrong. I wish I could disinvent social media, or at least somehow ensure it is used only for good. And I appreciate being part of Automobile’s proud history, enjoying the ride alongside all of you.', 'Read More', 'Jered Korfhage | Jun 5, 2025', 'Billy Rehbock | Jun 5, 2025', 'Billy Rehbock | Jun 5, 2025', 'Benjamin Hunting | Jun 5, 2025', 'Frank Markus | Jun 5, 2025', 'Justin Banner | Jun 5, 2025', 'Join Newsletter', 'Subscribe to our newsletters to get the latest in car news and have editor curated stories sent directly to your inbox.', 'Explore Offerings', '© 2025 MotorTrend | MOTOR TREND GROUP, LLC.

Porsche Built A Road-Legal Le Mans Car Just To Show It Still Could,https://www.theautopian.com/porsche-built-a-road-legal-le-mans-car-just-to-show-it-still-could/,"['If there’s one cliche worth burying in the back garden, it’s the whole “race car for the road” trope. Sure, some of today’s track day specials are properly ruthless instruments of speed, but few of them actually see competition in a form anything like their roadgoing counterparts. However, every so often, something true to the phrase appears. Porsche just turned its Le Mans prototype racer into a one-off road car called the 963 RSP, paying tribute to an exceptionally special road-legal Porsche of the past.', 'Gregorio Rossi di Montelera was more than just a Martini & Rossi heir, he had a penchant for speed. Powerboat racing? Check. Bobsledding? Check. Porsches? You bet. He’s part of the reason why the iconic Martini livery adorned Porsche race cars, and when it came to his most famous personal Porsche, Count Rossi set his sights higher than a 911.', 'In 1975, the Count decided that a Porsche 917K would make a great road car. You know, the fearsome flat-twelve-powered sports prototype racer that won Le Mans and the 24 Hours of Daytona twice. Conceptually, driving a 917K on the street is a bit like using a SCUD missile to remove a hornet nest, but Porsche obliged, so chassis number 30 was fitted with road-spec lights, mirrors, a more streetable exhaust system, and a luxurious tan Hermes leather interior. However, minor concessions alone aren’t enough to guarantee legality, and that’s where a transatlantic connection came in.', 'Legend has it that no European jurisdiction would approve such a savagely quick machine for the roads, so Count Rossi looked to America for some help making this thing seem legit. Once converted to road specification, 917 chassis number 30 wore an Alabama licence plate. Hard power, soft power, horsepower, same thing, right?', 'Fifty years since that particular Porsche 917K hit the streets, Porsche and Penske Racing decided it would be a cool thing to do again, so the two firms teamed up to create something called the 963 RSP. In essence, it’s Porsche’s LMDh hybrid hypercar with a twin-turbocharged V8, a 205-plus-MPH top-level weapon of speed that’s already racked up two World Endurance Championship titles.', 'Obviously, most race cars are terrible on the road. They’re too stiff for potholes and expansion joints, slicks are interesting in the wet, and many of them don’t have horns, which is a problem considering the shift to crossover utility vehicles has already made roadgoing sports cars harder for other drivers to see. However, by softening the dampers and raising the ride height, modifying the bodywork to provide better coverage against spray from the tires, fitting grooved rubber, and doing just enough to make the French government happy, the 963 RSP is technically road-legal.', 'The result is magnificent, a tan-leather-lined silver instrument of carbon kevlar that’s utterly alien in the context of modern road cars. Sure, Aston Martin has the Valkyrie, which offers an endurance racing variant and a road car variant, but its Cosworth V12 is a little more conventional than this new-breed force-fed hybrid Porsche. Plus, Porsche’s moving in the other direction: Aston Martin turned a road car into a race car, Porsche reversed that formula. It’s even tuned to run on pump gas.', 'After completing a tour of Europe from Le Mans to the Porsche Museum to the Goodwood Festival of Speed, don’t be surprised if the 963 RSP ends up in Roger Penske’s collection.

And doesn’t it look spectacular? A project undertaken by Porsche’s Sonderwunsch division - including a new Atlanta branch, opened in 2023 - it has been revealed to the world on the public roads near Le Mans. As if that wasn’t cool enough, it was driven alongside the ‘Count Rossi’ 917, chassis number 30 that was driven from Zuffenhausen to Paris 50 years ago by its ‘enigmatic’ owner and provided inspiration for this build. Timo Bernhard was behind the wheel of the 963 RSP; he said the experience “will stay with me for a lifetime.”', 'Making a LMDh race car suitable for the public highway - the 963 is wearing ‘W’ manufacturer license plates ‘under special permission from the French authorities’, with some healthy ACO support - is not the work of a moment. This is the first 963 to be painted, for example, as normally these things are wrapped in sponsor liveries. They aren’t usually painted because the bodywork is carbon and kevlar, therefore really tricky to paint and extremely thin in places as well. That being said, as you can see, they more than got the job done, the Martini Silver homage to the Rossi 917 beautifully executed. ', 'And while still very recognisably a Porsche 963, there are a few bodywork changes from race to road - beyond just the numberplates. So there are vents on the wings, unique to this car, where the track version has them open; the carbon blanking plates for the rear spoiler, mandatory on the racer, have been removed. Check out the enamel Porsche badge, too, as per a 917, and ‘1970s-era Michelin logos’ for the tyre sidewalls. Every single detail has been obsessed over, clearly. ', 'The Count Rossi 917 had tan leather inside, so this RSP does as well. Porsche suggests it’s ‘more accommodating’ than the race car, which wouldn’t be hard to achieve, though the extra mile has been romped through - look, there’s a cup holder and everything. The single-piece carbon seat now has a cushion and a headrest (fancy) plus the lovely leather, and there’s Alcantara for the pillars and roof, which presumably would have been bare beforehand. The wheel is leather, and there’s a horn. Note as well the alloy plaque denoting chassis number, plus another trimmed panel for the quick-release wheel, headset, and laptop that’s required to start the 963. The 917 didn’t need one of those.    ', ""More impressive still is the fact that the hybrid powertrain has been retained without much change. There’s a nice Penske link here with the 963, as the 4.6-litre V8 that powers the new car has its origins in the RS Spyder engine of the '00s. Decked out in the DHL livery, Penske-run RS Spyders won every possible LMP2 championship in the American Le Mans Series for three consecutive seasons from 2006-2008. It also went on, in modified form, to power the 918 Spyder."", 'For this installation, Porsche says the hybrid arrangement ‘remains in standard race tune’, though with the motor generator unit tweaked to make it a tad more easygoing for road use. And get this - the RSP can run on pump gas. Excuse the Americanism, that’s the phrase they use, and so potentially even the low-octane ditchwater found at so many gas stations. Porsche quite modestly suggests it was a ‘significant undertaking for the team’ to get a twin-turbo, 8,000rpm race V8 to accept regular fuel. You get the feeling it was probably one of the biggest headaches of the project, but hopefully all worth it to see an actual 963 drive on the road. ', 'While still using the Multimatic DSSV (Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve) dampers, this 963 has had them softened off to their most compliant and the ride height raised to its highest to give it some chance of dealing with street furniture. Or specially prepared streets, at least - this won’t be going out on a whim. The forged OZ wheels are running on rain-spec Michelin tyres, just in case.', 'Lastly, it’s worth mentioning the 963 RSP finishing touches. Because no one-off Sonderwunsch car from Porsche is complete without some goodies, and especially not when it’s Roger Penske’s one-off Sonderwunsch Porsche. So the helmet gets Martini accents just like the labour-of-love paintwork, there’s a custom Snap-on toolset (in a Martini Silver chest) for starting and servicing, plus there’s a plaque. Always gotta have a plaque. But it would seem like there’s every intention of the 963 RSP being used where possible, even if it’s headed to the Porsche museum after its public showings this summer at Le Mans and Goodwood. Certainly it feels like something to see given the opportunity. ', 'Penske said of the Porsche that bears his initials: “Just like the 917, I wanted this car to be authentic to its origin and have as few changes to it as possible. When we got into the project, the differences in the two generations of race cars provided a great challenge. What emerged is a car that has lost none of its edge and is exciting whether on the track or on the road.” We’ll take his word for that! As for the future of the 963, the RSP, and Sonderwunsch projects like it, Porsche is unequivocal: ‘While capable of being driven on the road under special circumstances… the 963 RSP is not a homologated addition to the Porsche model line-up and is intended to remain a very special one-off.’ So drink it all in now, or at Goodwood, or at the museum - it is the perfect excuse for a road trip, if nothing else…  ', 'The Rossi 917 was tested a couple of months back in Classic Cars magazine. From memory it was originally a test car, rather than a racer and Rossi had it converted and road registered in the mid 70s. It has that awful beige carpet in it, but still one of the true great cars and fearsomely powerful and fast.', 'Wonderful', '917 looks so much nicer.', 'Incredible, I love it when manufacturers do something because they can, not because they should.', 'Common Porsche W.

963 RSP Revealed: Meet Porsche's Street-Legal Le Mans Hypercar,https://www.motor1.com/news/761849/porsche-963-rsp-reveal/,"['', 'For years, the difference between road car and race car was a bit more nebulous than it is now. Especially at places like Le Mans, it wasn’t until the 1960s that the paths for road cars and top-flight prototypes started to diverge. Now, the stuff you see at the pointy end of the grid at La Sarthe has more in common with a Formula 1 car than, say, a 911.', 'Which is precisely why the Porsche 963 RSP is so remarkable. This is a real-deal 963 LMDh car, tamed just enough for road use, wearing a set of French license plates. We spoke with those who turned a crazy idea into reality.', 'At last year’s IMSA-season-ending Petit Le Mans, a group of Porsche folks got together to talk about how they could commemorate the 50th anniversary of the company’s creation of a roadgoing 917. Porsche made the car for Count Rossi, heir to the Martini & Rossi liquor fortune. Despite a fully trimmed interior, Rossi’s was a full-on Le Mans-winning race car for the road. The Italian managed to get a license plate from the state of Alabama, of all places, and actually enjoyed the car on the street.', 'Top Videos:', '“October 12th was the very specific day where a couple of people sat together and we were brainstorming. ‘How could we reimagine such a story as of today?’” recalls Timo Resch, CEO of Porsche Cars North America, in a virtual media roundtable. “And we started on that day project where only very few people were involved.”', 'They created what in Germany is referred to as a submarine project—one involving as few people as possible, existing beneath the visible surface, only emerging when absolutely necessary.', 'The team quickly deemed creating a fully road-homologated version of the 963 impossible. A car like this is just too far divorced from the requirements of street cars, so Porsche would have to alter it to an unrecognizable state to get it homologated. Instead, Porsche would create a one-off that hewed as closely to the race car as possible, and a car that could get special dispensation for very limited road use.', 'Obviously, Porsche would have to work with Porsche Penske Motorsport to make the car a reality, and the team decided that Roger would be the car’s ideal owner. The name RSP are the captain’s initials, Roger Searle Penske. ', 'Porsche Motorsport in Germany prepared a new chassis for the 963 RSP—this is not a reused tub from a race car. Under designer Grant Larson, Porsche Exclusiv Manufaktur did the design work, but the car was actually put together at Porsche Cars North America’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. There, it was worked on behind temporary walls, so the other technicians wouldn’t know what was going on.', '“A lot of changes have been made to suspension and systems to make it more tame and more like a road car, but still keep the pedigree of the 963 race car,” says Jonathan Diuguid, managing director of Porsche Penske Motorsport. “On top of this, what the restoration group in Atlanta has been able to bring forward is a level of quality that is not aligned with the race car at all, whatsoever.”', 'This isn’t to say the race cars aren’t Penske Perfect. But the finish on their carbon-fiber body panels is rough, and wrapped simply with vinyl. Here, PCNA craftspeople sanded down the carbon fiber bodywork and painted it in the same Martini Silver as the Count Rossi 917. They also trimmed the interior in Alcantara matching the tan of the 917 as well, and there are other nods to road usability. There’s leather on the steering-wheel grips and even a 3D-printed removable cup holder.', 'There are some bodywork changes, too. Racing rulebooks require huge vents over the wheel wells to prevent the car getting blown over in the case of a spin. For the RSP, Porsche created pieces that close in gaps, while still allowing for some ventilation. Also, the team had to make accommodations for front and rear license plates.', 'Despite such niceties, this is very much just a 963. You get a twin-turbo 4.6-liter V-8 paired with a spec hybrid system consisting of an electric motor and power electronics from Bosch, and an XTrac seven-speed sequential transmission. The battery is a small, 800-volt lithium ion unit from Fortescue Zero that bolts into the carbon-fiber tub from below.', 'The engine is derived from the naturally aspirated V-8 in the Porsche 918 Spyder hypercar, which itself was a development of the RS Spyder LMP2 car of the 2000s. It shares about 80 percent of its components with the 918 Spyder’s engine, so adapting it for road use wasn’t as difficult as it could have been with a bespoke racing engine. Still, adapting the V-8 to run on pump gas was a significant calibration challenge.', 'Porsche Penske Motorsport also tweaked the deployment of the hybrid system to be smoother, better suited for low-speed driving on the street. Porsche doesn’t quote a power figure for the 963 RSP, but the race car is capable of around 700 horsepower, split between the hybrid system and the V-8 depending on balance-of-performance. ', 'The 963 RSP sits on the same Michelin treaded rain tires the race cars use in inclement conditions, and they’re wrapped around 18-inch OZ wheels. Porsche set the ride height as high as it could, and put the dampers in their softest settings to make the car drivable on the street, though one imagines the ride quality will be a bit firm still. And yes, the 963 RSP has turn signals and a horn.', 'Famously, the 917 starts on a key drilled out to save weight. Starting the 963 is a bit more complicated—it requires a laptop, and the assistance of a race team that knows how the car works. So, Penske will need to do a bit of planning ahead if he wants to exercise the car, though as Porsche points out, he owns a race track and a race team, so using the 963 RSP won’t be too difficult.', 'Porsche got special permission from French authorities to drive the car on the roads around Le Mans, and the license plates it wears are for automakers testing prototypes. Longtime Porsche works driver and current brand ambassador Timo Bernhard drove the car on the roads near the circuit alongside the Rossi 917 earlier today. “That was an experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,” he said in a statement. “Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me—it felt unreal. The car behaved perfectly—it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963—and felt super special and a lot more comfortable, especially as I was not needing all my safety gear.”', 'Penske will have to wait a bit before he can take the car home. It will be on display at Le Mans, and then at the Porsche Museum. Next month, Porsche plans to take it to the Goodwood Festival of Speed to run it up the hillclimb. Then, the car will head to California for Monterey Car Week in August for more road drives, and the final handover to the Captain.', 'For now, at least, Porsche doesn’t have any specific further plans for another roadgoing 963, but that doesn’t mean it might not make one. “Of course we will not build exactly the same car again because of the nature of the project… but as I said before, never say never,” says Urs Kuratle, head of the Porsche LMDh project. “As Porsche, we like to sell cars first of all, and if there is an opportunity or possibility to do it again at a later stage, why not?

Welcome, one and all, to the mad, bad, and entirely brilliant Porsche 963 RSP.', 'It’s a version of Porsche’s WEC and IMSA competitor built to mark 50 years since a certain Count Rossi drove the all-conquering Porsche 917 from Zuffenhausen to Paris. Like that car, this one’s been tweaked so it’s street legal. Sorta.', '“How could we reimagine [the 917’s] story in today’s time?” asked Porsche’s North American boss Timo Resch.

For this very special project, the small team in charge of the RSP - including Porsche's Sonderwunsch department - decided early on that they’d need a brand-new 963 chassis, not an existing one. To which a number of very subtle, very important and likely mind-blowingly complicated changes were made."", 'The 963’s ride height was raised from a hair’s width to something more suitable for general roads, while the adjustable Multimatic DSSV dampers – designed for sports prototypes, don’t forget – were gaffer taped into their softest setting.', 'Then came one of the hardest bits: allowing the 4.6-litre, twin-turbo V8 hybrid powerplant to run on regular unleaded.

From this early stage, we came to the conclusion that he would be the perfect customer for such a car,” he added.', 'The only customer. It was never intended to be a fully homologated road legal 963 – indeed it needs special dispensation to run in France at the Le Mans 24hr weekend, and Porsche has got an exemption from the EPA in the States because “they understand it’s a one-of-one” and “how special it is”.

The Porsche 963 RSP Is An Actual Racing Car For The Road,https://www.carthrottle.com/news/porsche-963-rsp-actual-racing-car-road,"['The term ‘racing car for the road’ gets thrown around a lot in car circles, normally in reference to something with a half-cage and a fire extinguisher and some slightly more aggressive tyres. The Porsche 963 RSP, though, really is a racing car for the road.', 'Created by Porsche’s Sonderwunsch special order division and Penske Motorsport, the US outfit that runs its factory endurance programme, the 963 RSP is inspired by a similar treatment given to the legendary Porsche 917K endurance racer in the 1970s. It takes Porsche’s latest top-flight endurance racer and gives it a makeover designed to make it legal – and just a little bit usable – on the road.', 'That process began with the bodywork, with the RSP receiving new wheel arch vents to allow for better airflow management and the deletion of the race-regulation blanking plates in the rear wing. Slightly less exciting, but just as pragmatic additions are mounting points for number plates.', 'Underneath, the RSP has had its ride height raised – although we still wouldn’t fancy tackling a multi-storey in it – and the race-grade adjustable Multimatic dampers have been left in their softest setting. It rides on road-legal and rain-friendly tyres, too, wearing retro Michelin logos in a nod to the car’s 1970s inspo.', 'Rather remarkably, the powertrain is basically unchanged from the racing car, a 4.6-litre twin-turbo V8 paired with an MGU hybrid system. It helps that the engine already shares 80 per cent of its components with a road car, the 918 Spyder.', 'It’s nonetheless impressive, though, that the only major changes have been remapping the MGU for smoother power delivery and fettling the V8 to run on standard petrol station grade fuel. We’d probably go for E5 just to be on the safe side, though.', 'Its unshowy silver paint is shared with that famous roadgoing 917K, which was converted in 1975 at the behest of Italian playboy racer and heir to the Martini booze fortune, Count Rossi. And unlike the racing 963, it’s actual paint, not a vinyl wrap. That’s even a regular enamel Porsche badge on the nose.', 'The tan colour of the interior is also shared with the Count Rossi 917, and it’s been retrimmed in sumptuous leather and Alcantara. The seat itself has extra cushioning, and is even ventilated – although that’s actually a feature shared with the race car. Oh, and this might be the only car we’ve ever seen that comes with both a cupholder and ear defenders.', 'Despite all this, and the fact that the RSP even has a horn and indicators, its road legality will still vary by jurisdiction.

Porsche Built A One-Off Street-Legal 963 Hypercar For 88-Year-Old Roger Penske,https://www.jalopnik.com/1879166/porsche-built-one-off-street-legal-963-for-roger-penske/,"['', ""The 88-year-old billionaire spokesperson for RBF and team owner of the Porsche factory-supported IMSA and WEC sports prototype program, Roger Searle Penske, has received a very special gift from the German automaker. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of Porsche's last street-legal one-off Porsche 917 built for Count Rossi, the bigwigs in Stuttgart decided to honor The Captain with a one-of-one street-legal version of the 963 that his team's drivers race each weekend. Penske has been largely loyal to the Porsche brand since he started his own racing career back in the 1950s. Inspired by the racing version of the 963, this strassenversion literally has Roger's name on it, being dubbed 963 RSP. "", ""Debuting this special road-going race car in the run up to the 24 Hours of Le Mans (where Penske will field three Porsche 963s to fight for the overall win), Porsche brought the Count Rossi 917 out for the party as well, putting the two pioneering cars fifty years apart, but side by side. Finished in the same Martini Silver paint as the 917, the 963 RSP looks truly unique without the racecar's livery and sponsor logos. "", 'Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch, who conceived of the original idea. ""The 917 from the story was every inch a race car – albeit one driven on the road – and we took the same approach with the 963 RSP,"" Resch said. ""It uses beautiful materials of the best quality available, but is still every bit a race car underneath.""', '', 'There are a few major changes to the 963 visible from the outside, as the bodywork needed to be adapted from full-race to street-legal. Obviously the street car needs provisions for license plates front and rear. The front and rear fenders of the race car are typically open on top for maxiumum aero downforce, but the RSP needed some vents added over those holes to remain legal. The rear wing blanking plates are removed because the RSP does not need to maintain legality to the racing rulebook anymore. Finally, the whole thing is touched off with a nice metal and enamel Porsche badge on the hood, which obviously the race car does not get. ', ""Inside the 963 RSP you'll find a completely bespoke leather and Alcantara interior. A race car interior isn't exactly built for driver comfort, so the engineers and craftspeople at Porsche had a lot of work to do here. While the car is still a single-seater, has to be started with a laptop, and requires the use of a Peltor headset to hear anything inside the extremely loud carbon-fiber vehicle, everything is trimmed in supple tan leather, and the carbon bucket seat is even vented with conditioned air. Porsche also added a 3D-printed cup holder so a nearly-ninety Roger could climb aboard with his coffee in the morning. "", '', 'All Porsche 963s use a Bosch hybrid system paired to a turbocharged V8 powertrain. In race trim Porsche claims it makes 670 horsepower, though that can change with balance of performance restrictions. For the 963 RSP Porsche\'s engineers were forced to find a way to remap that engine to run on pump gas. There\'s no word on what the power number might be now, but the company does say it was a ""significant undertaking"" to re-tune the engine. It\'s possible for the 963 RSP to be run on electric power only, though the power delivery has been remapped to make the car a little smoother to drive in EV mode. ', ""The full carbon chassis of the 963 RSP is built by Canada's Multimatic, and features the dual-valve Multimatic DSSV dampers shared with the race car, though they're raised to maximum available ride height setting and tuned to be as soft as possible for a compliant road driving experience. Call me a skeptic, but I don't think Roger Penske will be climbing aboard this car and stacking a bunch of miles on it. That said, I do think the changes to make it more comfortable are pretty cool. "", 'Porsche says the car is ""capable of being driven on the road under special circumstances and in accordance with local requirements. For the purposes of this demonstration on French public roads, the company applied for French \'W\' manufacturer plates. As a further disclaimer, Porsche says ""the 963 RSP is not a homologated addition to the Porsche model lineup and is intended to remain a very special one-off."" If you want the 963 RSP you\'ll have to convince Mr. Penske to sell it, but he\'s a business man so everything probably has a (very steep) price.

Porsche 963 RSP is expected to make its debut on June 14! Only one in the world.,https://www.bitauto.com/us/news/1001100935153.html,"['Amidst the eager anticipation of vehicle enthusiasts, Porsche is set to introduce a sensational creation to the automotive world—the 963 RSP. This road-legal version, based on the 963 LMDh race car, is expected to make its debut on June 14. With only one unit to be produced globally, it is undoubtedly a dream car for many fans and collectors.', ""In terms of exterior, the 963 RSP is almost identical to the 963 LMDh race car seen at the race track. It retains Porsche's highly recognizable independent wheel arch design, which not only visually enhances the vehicle's sense of power but also effectively guides airflow at high speeds, improving the vehicle's stability and controllability. The teardrop cockpit design is also one of its standout features. This shape not only adheres to aerodynamic principles, reducing wind resistance and allowing for smoother driving, but it also gives the body a unique streamlined aesthetic, resembling a beast poised to strike, full of dynamism and tension. Notably, the three-dimensional Porsche logo embedded on the front contrasts sharply with the sticker logos on the race version, underscoring its unique street-legal identity while adding a touch of prestige. The body lines are smooth yet robust, with every curve and contour meticulously crafted, seemingly narrating Porsche's relentless pursuit of speed and aesthetics. From any angle, it exudes an irresistible allure."", ""Although the teaser video has not yet revealed much about the interior details, given Porsche's brand heritage and its relentless pursuit of luxury and technology, we have every reason to be excited about the interior of the 963 RSP. It can be imagined that the vehicle will be equipped with top-notch materials, from the seats to the central console, where every texture feels incredibly refined, providing an ultimate comfort experience. It might feature the most advanced digital dashboard, offering drivers clear and comprehensive vehicle information; a large central control screen integrated with a rich array of intelligent systems, making driving operations more convenient and efficient. Additionally, the ergonomic design inside the vehicle will likely reach the highest level, ensuring that drivers can enjoy the thrill of speed without feeling the slightest fatigue."", ""In terms of power, considering the formidable configuration of the 963 LMDh race car, the 963 RSP is expected to be equipped with a twin-turbo V8 engine, paired with a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a rear-mounted electric motor. This power combination will undoubtedly unleash astonishing performance, offering drivers an unparalleled driving experience. The twin-turbo V8 engine can deliver a continuous stream of robust power, while the rear-mounted electric motor provides additional torque support at crucial moments, making acceleration even more rapid. The seven-speed sequential gearbox shifts quickly and precisely, allowing drivers to fully control the vehicle's power output, whether cruising at low speeds on city roads or thrilling drives at high speeds on the race track."", 'The birth of the Porsche 963 RSP is not only another milestone for the Porsche brand but also a perfect fusion of LMDh racing passion and the practicality of road driving. On June 14th, let us all look forward to the stunning unveiling of this unique model and witness Porsche once again writing its legend.', '© 2024 Bitauto.com.

The company is preparing a road-going version of its 963 LMDh prototype, dubbed the 963 RSP. This one-off creation follows in the tire tracks of the iconic 911 GT1 Strassenversion, channeling Porsche’s endurance racing prowess into something that doesn’t require a pit crew to enjoy.', 'A short teaser video shared online by Porsche shows its expert craftsman putting the car together.

The cabin is also expected to be very similar to the endurance racer, albeit with some nicer materials to make it a little more comfortable and accommodating.', 'The name of the car could provide us with a clue as to who the special owner is.

PORSCHE BUILDS A 963 RACER FOR THE ROAD,https://www.goodwood.com/grr/road/news/porsche-builds-a-963-racer-for-the-road/,"['The phrase ‘racing car for the road’ is bandied about quite a lot, and often with a fair degree of poetic licence applied. But there’s no leeway needed for the Porsche 963 RSP, a crazy collaboration between Porsche and Penske. Sure, there’s some leather trim here and Alcantara finishing there, but it really is as close as you can get to a WEC and IMSA Championship winning 963 hypercar while carrying a set of number plates.', 'You’ll note those plates are French rather than German. Porsche itself admits that the headlights and tail lights operate “closer to those of a road car.” Not the same, just close enough. Close enough, it turns out, for French authorities to grant special permission for it to be driven for its debut. Other nods in the vague direction of type approval include a horn, Michelin wet weather tyres and revisions to the bodywork to cover the wheels. That was enough for the car to make its legal debut on the roads of La Sarthe.', 'For its first drive on the public highway, the one-off 963 RSP was accompanied by the car that inspired it. In 1975, Count Rossi ordered a Porsche 911 for the strasse which would be as close to the racing version as possible. He drove it from the factory in Zuffenhausen to Paris, and it remains road-registered to this day. Visitors to the Festival of Speed presented by Mastercard will have seen it in action. ', 'Back to the 963. The idea was first mooted at a trackside meeting between Timo Resch, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America, Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President, Porsche Motorsport, and Urs Kuratle, Director Factory Racing LMDh at Road Atlanta. Between them they wanted to recreate the concept of Count Rossi’s 917 with a current 963. ', 'Once they got Roger Penske and Jonathan Diuguid, Managing Director of Porsche Penske Motorsport on board, the project was a goer. Roger Penske was nominated as the customer and the car adopted his initials.', 'Under the skin, it uses the same hybrid V8 powertrain as the racing car. We can only hope the electrification helped with the road tax bill – we don’t profess to know the ins and outs of French duty, but we know enough to understand that performance cars are hit hard. It has been remapped for smoother delivery, and adapted to work on petrol pump fuel.', 'The 4.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 makes approximately 680PS (500kW) and originated in 3.4-litre form in the RS Spyder race programme. From 2006 to 2008, it has a clean sweep of LMP2 titles in the American Le Mans Series. It was then enlarged and fitted to the 918 Spyder road-going hypercar in naturally-aspirated form before being developed for the 963 racing car.', 'Visually, the 963 RSP uses the same Martini Silver hue as the 917, and it’s the only 963 to have been painted – the racing cars are wrapped, which is simpler to achieve on the thin composite panels. It’s inside where the RSP departs most notably from the racing car. It’s fully upholstered for one thing, while a single-piece carbon fibre seat is geared more towards comfort than support. There’s even a cup-holder.', 'A Macan it is not, however. The driver still has to contend with a cramped cockpit and in complete steering wheel rim the boss of which is festooned with buttons and dials that will require familiarisation. There’s also a harness rather than a seatbelt, and perhaps most tellingly a pair of ear defenders. Still, you won’t be making conversation since there’s no passenger seat. Well, it is a racing car for the road...', 'To prove that Porsche hasn’t taken itself too seriously, there are a few Easter eggs dotted around. The end plates for the ventilation mimic the styling of the fan on top of the 917’s flat-12 engine, while the tyre sidewalls feature the 1970s Michelin logo.', 'Usually when a car is described as a racing car for the road, the compromise leans more into the road car category. Not so with the 962 RSP. Those French ‘W’ number plates are issued to manufacturers for a specific purpose, which means Porsche needs permission to use the car on the road under specific circumstances.

In July, the car will appear alongside the 917 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England, before crossing the pond.', 'The Hypercar marks the second time Porsche has created a road version of its ultimate race car. The first was in 1975 when the German performance maker produced a street-legal Porsche 917 (which dominated international racing of that era) that was bought by Count Rossi, heir of the Martini & Rossi liquor fortune.', 'The eccentric Count then hit the road, driving from Zuffenhausen to Paris in the 580-horsepower, 12-cylinder 917.', 'In a brief street drive Friday near Le Mans, France, the 963 RSP debuted alongside that legendary 917 — just as the endurance racing world gathers for the week-long lead-up to the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race, June 14-15.', 'Notably, the 963 race car competed on the downtown streets of Detroit May 31 as part of the Detroit Grand Prix. Hitting speeds of over 180-mph on Jefferson Avenue, the Porsche threw up sparks as it bottomed repeatedly down the bumpy, ¾-mile-long straightaway.', '“It’s banging the skid plate through there at nearly 200 mph,” said British race driver Nick Tandy, who co-piloted the #7 963 with Brazilian Felipe Nasr to fourth place in a thrilling race. “You can feel it coming up through the cabin.

Porsche Penske is bringing three 963s to compete in next week’s Le Mans.', '“Just like the 917, I wanted this car to be authentic to its origin and have as few changes to it as possible,” continued Penske. “When we got into the project, the differences in the two generations of race cars provided a great challenge. What emerged is a car that has lost none of its edge and is exciting whether on the track or on the road.”', 'While retaining most of the mid-engine race car’s dynamics – including the ferocious, 670-horspower, 4.6-liter, twin-turbo V-8 hybrid powertrain - the street car boasts significant changes to make it more comfortable.', 'The 963 RSP will not be started by a key to to the left of the steering wheel like Porsche production cars such as the 911 supercar and Macan SUV.

The car has been lifted slightly — and its Multimatic spool-valve shocks softened — for a more compliant street drive. Tires? The same Michelin rain tires as the race car. Also missing from the 963 RSP are the race car’s fender cutouts — necessary on track to mitigate high-speed flips — but which take away from its aesthetic appearance on the road.', 'In a nod to tradition, an enamel Porsche badge is added to the nose, a detailed shared with the 1975 917.', 'Complete with headlight and taillight modifications to suit public roads — as well as turn signals, a horn, and front/rear license plates — the 963 RSP met permissions criteria from French authorities to ply public roads for its reveal today.', '“An experience that will stay with me for a lifetime,” said Le Mans winner and Porsche racer Timo Bernhard, who was at the wheel of the 963 RSP for its first road miles. “Driving down a public road with a 917 beside me — it felt unreal. The car behaved perfectly — it felt a little friendlier and more forgiving than the normal 963 — and felt super special and a lot more comfortable, especially as I was not needing all my safety gear.”', 'The comfortable cockpit is a mix of luxurious appointments and raw race features.', 'Like the race car the 963 RSP features a single piece, air-conditioned carbon seat — but it is trimmed in leather with a fixed headrest mounted on the bulkhead behind the seat. The steering wheel — bristling with operating functions — is true to the racer but has been finished in leather. The aforementioned cupholder is 3D-printed and capable of holding a Porsche travel mug.', '“This really started out as a ‘what if?’ — a passion project by a small team of enthusiasts at Penske and at Porsche who together imagined a version of the 963 that really resembled as closely as possible the spirit and appearance of the Count Rossi 917,” said Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Timo Resch, who conceived of the 963 RSP. “The 917 was every inch a race car — albeit one driven on the road — and we took the same approach with the 963 RSP.”', 'No word on whether Penske intends to cruise on Woodward this August.', 'Henry Payne is auto critic for The Detroit News.

The 963 RSP will be allowed to drive a specific route in France during Le Mans race week, where it will meet its spiritual predecessor, the street-legal 917 racer that Porsche built for Count Rossi in 1975. Once it's back stateside, well, we have a feeling that Penske and Porsche will manage to work something out with the relevant authorities. (Perhaps there's a scrap of metal in the dash that will allow it to be registered as a 1982 924.) And the United States, strangely enough, is where the 963 RSP was completed, at the Porsche Classic shop in Atlanta."", ""Porsche Classic is accustomed to high-end restorations, and that kind of expertise is what's needed to make a gritty race machine meet the expectations of a guy whose initials are in the car's name. The interior got a lot of custom leather and, much to the Germans' amusement, a 3-D-printed cupholder. (The DRK button on the steering wheel, for dispensing drinks to the driver, is still present but doesn't work.)"", ""The carbon-fiber body received a lot of attention to smooth the burrs and imperfections that don't matter on a race car. The suspension is softer, the ride height is higher, and the huge holes atop the fenders are covered with vents. There's a backup camera too. The 963 RSP has headlights, taillights, turn signals, and a horn. But this is still very much a race car, lightly domesticated though it may be. You don't start it with a key, you start it with a laptop."", ""Though it's a fully modern 963, the RSP includes some throwback aesthetic touches. The paint—not a wrap like the race cars would get—is Porsche Martini Silver, the same hue applied to the 917 back in the day. The Michelin tires (race tires, but full-wet versions with tread) wear 1970s logos on the sidewalls. And the color scheme of the interior, with brown leather and Alcantara, evokes the Count Rossi car."", 'Price? More than a base Macan, hopefully less than you\'d pay for a 917K. Porsche seems to have had fun with this project, so although this particular car is a one-off, Porsche isn\'t saying that it\'ll be 50 more years before it builds something similar for other moneyed mega-fans. Like, might this car pave the way for a 963 JAS? Urs Kuratle, Porsche Motorsport director of factory racing, put it this way: ""Never say never.""', ""Ezra Dyer is a Car and Driver senior editor and columnist. He's now based in North Carolina but still remembers how to turn right. He owns a 2009 GEM e4 and once drove 206 mph.
