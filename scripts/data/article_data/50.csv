A ferocious crowd at Paycom Center stood and roared, and their team of choice, the Oklahoma City Thunder, seized the court, primed to chase down the first league championship since the franchise came to town in 2008.', 'The Indiana Pacers joined the fray about an hour later.', 'Through the first half, the Pacers wound too tight, which showed itself in playing too fast, neglecting details of their game plan and, worst of all, coughing up the ball at a record pace.', 'Let’s be clear about that: No team in the play-by-play era (since 1997) ever had turned over the ball 19 times in a half of a Finals game, first or second … until the Pacers did that Thursday night in Game 1.', 'It was the antithesis of what they had hoped to do against the handsy, pushy Thunder defense. And it seemed certain to be their undoing over the final 24 minutes. Until it wasn’t, and they wriggled out of their self-buckled strait jacket on guard Tyrese Haliburton’s trademarked game-winner.', '', 'The Pacers — away from prying eyes, in a visitors’ locker room that easily could have gone sideways — checked themselves and their emotions. Had they looked in the mirrors there, underneath the raucous stands, they would have seen some ugly, unfamiliar image of themselves staring back.', 'Their shooting wasn’t horrible and even the hole they’d dug on the scoreboard could have been worse: OKC 57, Indiana 45. They had managed only five fewer buckets than the Thunder, but were hemorrhaging possessions with the turnovers, getting up 19 fewer shots.', 'The Eastern Conference champions prided themselves all season on taking care of the ball. Their 13.2 turnovers per game in the regular season were better than all but two teams, and they had shaved that to 12.7 against through three playoff rounds against the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks.', 'It was amazing that, for all the giveaways, the Thunder had only stung them for nine points directly off those miscues. Still, it was no formula for success, more a recipe for disaster.', '“We like controlled chaos,” Haliburton said, “but that was just chaos. Ugly.”', 'Something had to change.', 'Indiana outscores Oklahoma City 32-16 in the final 9:42 to erase a late 15-point deficit in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.', 'It’s easy but not at all helpful to come out for the third quarter thinking, “Take better care of the ball.” Just what does that mean? On the fly, against the NBA’s nastiest defense, emboldened by all those stolen Pacers possessions, in the Finals?', '“We just knew we had to value the ball a lot more,” center Myles Turner said, before delving into specifics. “We started to put two hands, two eyes on the ball. Whoever [was] passing it started to keep the ball high. It was just all the elementary stuff. Sometimes that’s what it’s about in this game is going back to fundamentals. Chin on the ball, stuff like that.”', 'In the first half, four different Pacers had three turnovers or more. In the second, none of them did. They gave up the ball just five times, and OKC turned those into just two points.', 'Instead, Indiana outscored the favored-and-rolling home team 66-53 in the second half, including 35-25 in the fourth quarter. The Pacers’ offense settled down and returned to form: 51% shooting overall in the half, 10-of-20 on 3-pointers, 1.4 points per possession. All five starters and key sub Obi Toppin — from a roster that was entirely underwater in the first half — all had robust plus-ratings in the second.', 'One lead change all night and it came when it mattered most. But without the Pacers calming down, passing with more intent and factoring in OKC’s greediness for the ball and banging ways of springing it loose, Haliburton’s hero moment would not, could not, have happened.', '“The turnovers were the first thing that we talked about. You know, it seemed like we were doing a good job on the boards but they had 20 more shots than we did in the first half. That was really fool’s gold. … So, look, it was just hit the reset button. Let’s go whistle-to-whistle in the third quarter, try to chip away at it, and try to hang in.”\n— Pacers coach Rick Carlisle.', '“You just said it, we knew what this team was. I think on this stage you don’t have time to be stunned. You don’t have time to be disappointed. … It’s probably historically bad, I’m not sure what the record is but we weathered the storm.”\n–Turner on falling into the turnover trap they knew was waiting for them vs. OKC.', '“I thought they loosened us up a little bit. They took better care of the ball. … But I thought our conversion on the turnovers in the first half hurt us a little bit. We didn’t get the kind of juice for that squeeze that we normally do when we turn teams over.”\n–Thunder coach Mark Daigneault on the Pacers’ shift in the third quarter.', '“It’s just not who we are but I mean credit to their defense, like they are just on another level in terms of just disrupting the game and making mistakes and stuff.”\n— Indiana’s Pascal Siakam.', 'Patching a hole on the fly was good enough for Indiana on Thursday, but they will spend plenty of time breaking down video over the next two days before Sunday’s Game 2 (8 ET, ABC). This refresher course, facing the beast that is the Thunder’s disruptive defense, dare not be wasted.', 'For OKC, it’s one thing to bother an opponent into 25 turnovers, but quite another to get only 11 points off the extra opportunities.

"Tyrese Haliburton, voted most overrated, is getting the last laugh at the NBA Finals",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/2025-nba-finals-pacers-thunder-tyrese-haliburton-rcna211000,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'It’s an odd time for a native New Yorker to heap praise on Tyrese Haliburton, the Indiana Pacers point guard who knifed through the New York Knicks defense like butter in the Eastern Conference finals and fried Gotham’s hope for its first NBA Finals appearance this millennium. But not only did former NBA champion and Queens’ own Metta Sandiford-Artest do so; he also said Haliburton’s dominance in the Knicks series was reminiscent of a certain Basketball Hall of Famer.', 'As recently as April, his NBA peers voted him the league’s most overrated player. Ouch.', '“He reminds me of John Stockton from the perspective of a late bloomer in terms of effectiveness. … Not the same type of player but the same type of impact,” Sandiford-Artest told NBA reporter Brandon Robinson this week.', 'Stockton, who played 19 years in the NBA, wasn’t considered as elite as Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. And to Sandiford-Artest’s point, there’s legitimacy in considering Haliburton a late bloomer. As recently as April, his NBA peers voted him the league’s most overrated player. Ouch. Guess who’s getting the last laugh, though? As the 2025 NBA playoffs have shown, it’s Haliburton’s moment now.', 'With the NBA Finals starting tonight, he’s the unquestioned leader of an underdog Indiana Pacers team that almost no one thought had a legitimate shot at the title when the playoffs began. He has a chance to do something not even Pacers legend Reggie Miller could do: win Indiana its first NBA title.', 'Some pundits are bemoaning what the matchup between the Pacers and the Oklahoma City Thunder might mean ratings-wise, as each team resides in the bottom third of NBA cities when ranked by TV market size. We could have had the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics (again) or the Lakers and the Knicks.', 'Instead, we have… Haliburton. And you know what? That’s fantastic. No, really, it’s great. And here’s why: Haliburton is having a great playoff run, averaging 18.8 points, 9.8 assists and 5.7 rebounds a night (for all his playoff series, six in total, he’s averaged 18.7, 5.3 and 9). He put up 32 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds in a dominant Game 4 against the Knicks — becoming the only NBA player in history with 30 points and 15 assists while committing no turnovers in a playoff game.', 'This postseason aside, Haliburton isn’t known for gaudy stats. The real beauty in his game, and what promises to make the finals something worth everybody’s attention, is his efficiency, a statistic that puts a number to how much a player contributes when they’re on the court. The average player efficiency rating in the NBA is 15; Haliburton’s efficiency has been above 20 in each of the past four seasons, and it’s never dipped below 16. This season, he ranked 20th among NBA players, with an efficiency rating of 21.84. The highest rating belonged to the Denver Nuggets’ Nikola Jokic, at 32.12.', 'It’s the kind of stat that won’t wow casual basketball fans who live for the 3-ball, or old-school fans who long for scoring assassins like Jordan or Carmelo Anthony. Efficiency explains why a player like Haliburton is so significant to the Pacers because the statistic considers how often a player scores the ball and how well they perform on the floor when they don’t have the ball.', 'To put his efficiency rating another way, Haliburton is capable of taking over games — like he did against the Knicks — but he’s also content to shift into a style of basketball that prompted ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, an unabashed Knicks fan, to declare before the Pacers-Knicks series that he’s not a superstar. Like a true point guard, he prefers to move the ball rather than force a low-percentage shot. He gets back on defense. He recognizes when the ball is better off in the hands of a teammate, for example Eastern Conference finals MVP Pascal Siakam.', 'Unsurprisingly, he finished the season ahead of the vanquished Knicks’ Jaylen Brunson — who is a superstar, according to ESPN’s Smith — and the Celtics’ Jayson Tatum, whom the Knicks vanquished in the playoffs, in efficiency rating. It has to be worrisome for the Pacers, but exciting for fans eager for a great finals matchup, that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the last barrier standing between them and glory. OKC’s lethal point guard, who posted a 30.73 efficiency rating, is the only one of the 19 players with a better efficiency rating than Haliburton in the finals.', 'Unlike Haliburton, Gilgeous-Alexander has never had his superstar bona fides questioned. If Haliburton and the Pacers can overcome him and a Thunder team that had the best record in the league this year, then the Pacers point guard won’t ever have to worry about being called overrated or being labeled as less than a superstar again.', 'Keith Reed is an award-winning journalist and a past senior editor at ESPN.

You went to the Olympics last summer and didn’t play much. You came into this season with high expectations and your Indiana Pacers got off to a 10-15 start. And on top of that, some of your NBA peers evidently think you are overrated.', 'You got angry.', '“I think as a group, we take everything personal,” Haliburton said. “It’s not just me. It’s everybody. I feel like that’s the DNA of this group and that’s not just me.”', 'The anger fueled focus, the focus became confidence, and the confidence delivered a 1-0 series lead in the NBA Finals. Haliburton’s penchant for last-second heroics – one of the stories of these playoffs – showed up again Thursday night, his jumper with 0.3 seconds left going into Finals lore and giving the Pacers a 111-110 victory over the heavily favored Oklahoma City Thunder.', 'The Pacers led for 0.0001% of that game. It was enough.', '“When it comes to the moments, he wants the ball,” Pacers teammate Myles Turner said. “He wants to be the one to hit that shot. He doesn’t shy away from the moment and it’s very important this time of the year to have a go-to guy. He just keeps finding a way and we keep putting the ball in the right positions and the rest is history.”', 'Haliburton is 4 for 4 in the final two seconds of fourth quarters and overtimes in these playoffs, all of those shots either giving the Pacers a win or sending a game into OT before they won it there.', 'The rest of the NBA, in those situations this spring: 4 for 26, combined.', '“YOU CAN’T MAKE IT UP,” Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark – possibly the only Indiana guard more beloved than Haliburton these days in the basketball-mad state – posted on X moments after he hit his latest beat-the-clock thriller.', 'If Haliburton takes one of those beat-the-clock shots in the first three quarters of games in these playoffs, he’s a mere mortal, just 1 for 7 in those situations. But with the game on the line, he’s perfect.', '“You don’t want to live and die with the best player on the other team taking a game-winner with a couple seconds left,” Thunder guard Alex Caruso said.', 'No, especially when that best player on the other team is Haliburton. Just ask Milwaukee. Or Cleveland. Or New York. They could have all told Oklahoma City who was going to take the big shot and what was probably going to happen.', 'Against the Bucks on April 29, it was a layup with 1.4 seconds left that capped a rally from seven points down in the final 34.6 seconds of overtime. Final score: Pacers 119, Bucks 118, and that series ended there.', 'In Cleveland on May 6, it was a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left for a 120-119 win – capping a rally from seven points down in the final 48 seconds. At Madison Square Garden against the Knicks on May 21, a game the Pacers trailed 121-112 with 51.1 seconds left, he hit a jumper with no time left to force OT and Indiana would win again.', 'All those plays came with a little something extra. His father, John Haliburton, got a little too exuberant with Giannis Antetokounmpo after the Bucks game and wasn’t allowed to come to the next few games; the ban has since been lifted. Haliburton did a certain dance that the NBA doesn’t like much after the shot against the Cavs. He made a choke signal, a la what Pacers legend Reggie Miller did against New York a generation earlier, after hitting the shot against the Knicks.', 'But on Thursday, all business. These Finals are a long way from over, and he knows it. Game 2 is Sunday night in Oklahoma City.', '“Again, another big comeback but there’s a lot more work to do,” Haliburton said. “That’s just one game. And this is the best team in the NBA, and they don’t lose often. So, we expect them to respond. We’ve got to be prepared for that. We got a couple days to watch film, see where we can get better.”', 'Haliburton is in the first year of a supermax contract that will pay him about $245 million along the way. He has the Olympic gold medal from last summer and surely will be a serious candidate to play for USA Basketball again at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. He’s now a two-time All-NBA selection. And he’s officially a certified postseason, late-game hero.', 'Three more wins, and he’ll be an NBA champion as well. The anger is gone. Haliburton was all smiles after Game 1, for obvious reasons.', '“Ultimate, ultimate confidence in himself,” Turner said. “Some players will say they have it but there’s other players that show it, and he’s going to let you know about it, too. That’s one of the things I respect about him. He’s a baller and a hooper and really just a gamer.”', 'And in his NBA Finals debut, Haliburton reminded the world that’s the case.', '“This group never gives up,” Haliburton said. “We never believe that the game is over until it hits zero, and that’s just the God’s honest truth. That’s just the confidence that we have as a group, and I think that’s a big reason why this is going on.”', '', '', 'Copyright © 2025 MediaNews Group', ""Hurry, this deal won't last!"", '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNUpWWEJ4WWpST1UyaGxlRTF0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

And both times they lost after subpar late-game execution and game-winning shots coming on broken plays.', '“The playoffs take you to the limit,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said after Game 1 when asked if Thursday’s loss was reminiscent of the Nuggets game. “They put your back against the wall, in games, in series.

As a result, both Hartenstein and big man Chet Holmgren had smaller roles in the rotation, each playing fewer minutes than their playoff average so far.', '“We’ve been pretty fluid with the lineup throughout the course of the season,” Daigneault said. “Cason started 40-something games. We changed the lineup a million times. We haven’t in the playoffs. That’s why we do it during the regular season, so that it’s not earth-shattering when we do it.”', 'He added: “We’ll see how the series goes. We have a lot of optionality. We’ll look at everything.

Meanwhile, Hartenstein and Holmgren didn’t share the floor together for a single possession.', 'Whatever the Thunder decide to switch up (if anything) for Game 2, they did not seem overly distraught after such a shocking defeat Thursday night.

Despite that adjustment, it's still easier to build a high comeback score with fewer ones rather than as many as the Pacers (and Knicks) have thus far. When we graph the average comeback score for each playoff team since 1997 against their wins -- with this year's teams highlighted by primary color -- it's obvious what outliers Indiana and New York are."", 'Working with Beuoy, we tried a few different methods to find a single comeback method that accounts for both the volume of comebacks and their improbability. The most satisfying we found was taking the product of the likelihood of each win at its lowest point -- which is to say, the odds that a team would win all the games it did in the playoffs.', ""Looking at things this way heavily favors teams with more playoff wins, whether via comeback or not, since no game is a 100% win probability from the jump. Nonetheless, the Pacers' 12 wins (and counting) rank second since 1997 in this group, trailing only the 2011 champion Dallas Mavericks, who had 16 wins. You can see Dallas on the chart as having the highest comeback score of any title winner."", ""Meanwhile, the Knicks' 10 wins rank seventh, higher than any team before this year without reaching the Finals."", ""All four Indiana comebacks have seen the team emerge victorious after win probability estimates gave that a 2.1% chance of happening or less, including 0.9% against New York. It's not quite getting struck by lightning twice (your odds of that happening once are estimated by the National Weather Service at .000065%, based on an 80-year lifespan), but it's awfully unlikely by random chance alone."", ""Based on that, you can be forgiven for some skepticism about win probability. Part of the challenge is these estimates are based on historical data that may not always keep up with the fast-moving NBA. ESPN's model, for example, was built in 2017 based on training data from the previous seven or so seasons. As comebacks grow more common due to a faster pace of play and an increased volume of 3s, a trend I wrote about with ESPN's Baxter Holmes back in 2019, it's possible we're underestimating the chances to a degree."", 'The other issue is calibration. All models have uncertainty, but the difference between a win probability of 57% and 58% is irrelevant in most practical contexts. At the extremes, the uncertainty is magnified because a comeback from a 98% win probability is twice as likely as one from 99%. And a comeback from 99% (one in 100 odds) is 10 times more likely than one from 99.9% (one in 1,000). So even small calibration issues are important.', 'There could be an explanation for why this postseason in particular has seen so many comebacks, when most factors that are cited have been in place for years: the relationship between offense and defense. Offenses are typically somewhat more effective after getting a stop because it allows more opportunities for early offense and cross-matching on defense, but the benefit of getting a stop (or vice versa) can depend on a variety of factors that change from team to team and season to season.', ""In general, these playoffs have featured an enormous difference in efficiency depending on whether the offense starts on a defensive rebound or takes the ball out of the net after a made basket. Returning to Inpredictable.com, their data shows teams averaging a 1.17 points per possession after a defensive rebound as compared to 1.07 after a made shot or a dead ball turnover. (The average off steals, or live ball turnovers, is much higher at 1.23 points per possession.) That's a change from the past few playoffs, when the difference by start type has been much smaller -- just 0.01 points per possession better in 2022 and 2023."", 'As for why that might have changed, I would point to increased physicality being allowed by referees in the playoffs the past two years. Inevitably, physicality is more of an issue during half-court situations rather than transition. During the 2023 playoffs, when the whistles were tighter, teams averaged a more efficient 1.1 points per possession after a made shot or dead ball turnover.', ""I think that could tie into why avoiding turnovers has been crucial in this year's playoffs. As Owen Phillips of the F5 Newsletter has been tracking, the team with fewer turnovers has gone 53-20 (.726), which would be the highest winning percentage for such teams in a single playoffs on record. Last year, teams with fewer turnovers won just 60% of the time, about the average over the past decade (62%). Turnover battle winners were barely better than .500 in 2018-19 (41-37)."", ""It's tougher to explain why teams are scoring so efficiently off defensive rebounds this year, though fatigue could be a factor with starters on several teams that reached the conference semifinals logging heavy minutes."", ""Switching our focus to Indiana specifically, the Pacers do derive more benefit than most teams from defensive rebounds. They've averaged 1.26 points per possession after those, per Inpredictable, third best in the NBA. Although Indiana is still third after a made shot or dead ball, their efficiency drops by an above-average .16 points per possession."", ""At the other end of the court, we see a similarly large split. The Pacers' defense is 10th best after a made shot or dead ball turnover and .17 points per possession worse after a defensive rebound, dropping to 14th."", ""Now, what does this have to do with comebacks? The bigger the gap between stops and scores at the other end of the court, the streakier a team (or league) is likely to be because the magnitude of each possession is amplified. A stop isn't just preventing the opponent from scoring, it's also juicing the team's offense, and vice versa -- a virtuous cycle or a vicious one, depending on your perspective."", ""The streakier the game, the more likely teams are to build big leads, and the more likely opponents are to rally from them. Add it up and you've got the recipe for Indiana's comebacks."", ""On the flip side, despite losing a fourth-quarter lead in Game 1 of their series with the Denver Nuggets and staging a comeback from down 26 at halftime against the Memphis Grizzlies, the Oklahoma City Thunder haven't been as dependent on their offense to succeed defensively. Oklahoma City has been very good defending after a made shot or dead ball turnover (second on a per-possession basis after the Detroit Pistons) but is allowing .08 points per possession fewer than any other team on possessions that begin with defensive rebounds."", '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNUpWWEJ4WWpST1UyaGxlRTF0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

The unsinkable Pacers don’t need the lead.

But belief, defiance and Tyrese Haliburton’s dramatic flair made the final 0.3 count', 'T\nhis is why you play the games, as the old adage goes. In recent years, the later rounds of the NBA playoffs – and the finals in particular – have felt rote. They’ve gone chalk. The drama was minimal, even under the brightest lights of the league’s biggest stage. This year has been different: a playoffs filled with suspense, tension and plot twists galore. But at the start of the finals, the scene was set for a regression to the intrigue-less mean. Every roundtable pundit, basketball expert and barbershop patron outside of Indiana state lines had Oklahoma City – basketball’s best team from wire to wire – winning the series easily.', 'But Tyrese Haliburton, the instigator of several of this postseason’s most jaw-dropping twists, knows a thing or two about drama. It oozes out of his pores. And he and his Indiana Pacers had other plans.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The Pacers did not lead for 47 minutes and 59.7 seconds of Game 1 on Thursday in Oklahoma City. On a night when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the regular-season MVP, scored 38 points and no Indiana player topped 19, it should have been a wrap. The Thunder’s suffocating defense, among the league’s best, forced a famously ball-conscious Indiana team – one that averages just 12 turnovers a game – into coughing it up 19 times in the first half alone. That’s hardly a recipe for success. Yet somehow, the Pacers came out victorious, against the odds, against the physics, against conventional basketball logic. Because that’s what they do. You can’t beat the Pacers by playing 47 minutes and 59.7 seconds of winning basketball. They demand all 48.', 'This was the fifth comeback victory of 15 or more points for the Pacers this postseason alone, the most by any NBA team in the play-by-play era. Haliburton has hit a game-winning shot in all four rounds of these playoffs, each feeling more improbable than the last: his Pacers have been underdogs in each of those series and never more so than they were when they entered the Paycom Center on Thursday. For all the talk heading into the series about how Indiana had never seen a defense like the Oklahoma City’s, we seem to have forgotten, as a general basketball viewing populace, about another key factor: Oklahoma City have never seen a team like Indiana in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter.', '“They have a lot of belief,” Oklahoma City head coach Mark Daignault said, after his team’s dispiriting loss, of his ballsy Indiana opponent. “They never think they’re out of it. So they play with great belief, even when their backs are against the wall.” That belief – unwavering, unshakable – is Indiana’s secret sauce. And with every impossible comeback, it compounds on itself. The more they pull off, the less impossible it all feels.', 'After Thursday’s win, Haliburton reflected on where that belief started: last year’s humiliating sweep in the Eastern Conference finals. “After you have a run like last year but end up getting swept – and all the conversation is about how you didn’t belong there, how you lucked out, how it was a fluke – guys are gonna spend the summer pissed off,” he said. “Then you come into this year, and after an unsuccessful first couple of months, it’s easy for everybody to clown you. I think, as a group, we take everything personal.”', 'On the character of his team, which has left opposing crowds stunned at every turn this postseason, he sums it up simply: “We don’t give up until it’s zero on the clock.”', 'Haliburton says being the underdog, proving people wrong, has become part of the team’s identity. “It’s fun,” he says, to win when you’re not supposed to. And this win, like all of Indiana’s wins have been , was a true team effort – even if Haliburton’s flair for the dramatic grabs most of the headlines. It was a true win by committee, whether it was Aaron Nesmith muscling his way to a critical rebound on a bad ankle, Andrew Nembhard coming up with late-game heroics on both ends (including a huge stop on Gilgeous-Alexander), or Obi Toppin scoring 11 of his 17 points in the second half off the bench. All five Pacers starters scored in double figures – so did Toppin – but none cracked 20.', 'It’s probably not the platonic ideal for a basketball team to rely on procuring its biggest wins in such white-knuckle fashion, but the Pacers sure are good at it, and it makes for a hell of an entertainment product. And in the highly competitive and intense NBA postseason, where wins become harder and harder to come by, teams will take them however they can, messy and chaotic as they may be. After Thursday’s instant classic, Haliburton summed up the Indiana ethos succinctly: “Come May and June, it doesn’t matter how you get ‘em. Just get ‘em.”']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNUpWWEJ4WWpST1UyaGxlRTF0VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

You are thinking about it.”', 'The Pacers have become the NBA’s ultimate playoff nightmare — a team that’s never truly beaten until the final buzzer sounds.

Tyrese Haliburton caps off another epic comeback with last-second shot as Indiana stuns OKC in Game 1 of the NBA Finals,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/sport/nba-finals-game-1-indiana-pacers-oklahoma-city-thunder-spt,"['Tyrese Haliburton ensured yet another fanbase will see him in their nightmares after he drained a shot in the final second of Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday, giving his team an incredibly unlikely 111-110 victory.', 'As he did to Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York in the previous rounds of these playoffs, Haliburton shattered the Oklahoma City Thunder with a pull-up jumpshot that capped off yet another incredible comeback for the Pacers in the playoffs. Down by as much as 15 with just under 10 minutes to go in the game, the Pacers made two separate 12-2 runs in the fourth quarter to give themselves a chance to steal the first game of the Finals.', 'When Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who played up to his MVP billing with 38 points, missed a shot to ice the game with 11 seconds to go, Haliburton got the ball near halfcourt and did what he does best: Bring opposing fans to their knees.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nNBA Finals: What to know as OKC Thunder and Indiana Pacers battle for title', 'Haliburton drove to his right, stopped hard to create an inch of space against the Thunder’s suffocating defense and pulled up with a jump shot. He buried it, silencing the rowdy Paycom Arena and giving the Pacers their only lead of the game.', '“We got the stop and coach trusts us in those moments … I’m just trying to make a play. Man, basketball is fun, winning is fun,” Haliburton told ESPN after the final horn sounded.', 'It’s a frankly stunning result. The Thunder had led the whole game and at times looked ready to deliver the killer blow, poised to go on one of their devastating runs that have been a signature move this season.', 'But the Pacers have made a habit of hanging around during this run to the Finals and striking when they finally have an opening.', 'On Thursday, they just happened to wait 47 minutes and 59.7 seconds for that moment.', 'The game started off exactly how the Thunder wanted. Oklahoma City forced the Pacers into nine first quarter turnovers with their swarming defense that has been a hallmark of the team throughout the season.', 'Gilgeous-Alexander poured in 12 points in the opening stanza and paced the Thunder to a 10-point lead after the first 12 minutes.', 'As the game moved into the second quarter, the Thunder stayed in control as both teams went through a shooting lull. Most of the scoring in the opening stages of the quarter was done from the free throw line as the Thunder built their lead to double digits. The Pacers though, pesky as they have been all year, didn’t let the home crowd pick up too much steam as they kept the Thunder within striking range and shrank the lead down to four with five minutes to go in the quarter on a cutting drive by Eastern Conference finals MVP Pascal Siakam.', 'In what would prove to be the key sequence of the first half, Luguentz Dort answered that layup with a 3-pointer to extend the lead once again and the Thunder forced the Pacers into their 13th and 14th turnovers on successive possessions. Dort then caused the Pacers’ 15th turnover with a steal and drilled another 3-pointer on the ensuing possession to rebuild the lead to 10. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle called a timeout to blunt the run with a little more than four minutes to play in the half.', 'The half ended with Dort giving the Thunder their biggest lead of the opening phases with his third 3-pointer of the quarter, putting the Thunder up 50-37 with two-and-a-half minutes to go in the second. Gilgeous-Alexander continued his MVP-worthy play with a game-leading 19 points at halftime. The Thunder led by 12, 57-45, at halftime.', 'The Pacers out-rebounded the Thunder in the first half and were shooting better from the field but the 19 turnovers – compared to the Thunder’s four – were the outlier on the stat sheet. Haliburton only scored six points as the Pacers’ star player went quiet in the first half – as he had in both of the Pacers’ games against OKC during the regular season. The Eastern Conference champions were paced by TJ McConnell’s 9 points off the bench in the first half.', 'OKC couldn’t find the knockout blow and the Pacers couldn’t quite cut into the Thunder lead. Dort continued to rediscover his shooting touch, hitting more from long-range in the third quarter and shaking off his 31% 3-point percentage in the first three rounds of the playoffs. But every time Dort or one of his teammates made a big shot that set the crowd at the Paycom Center into a roar, the Pacers had an answer to keep the game from getting out of control.', 'The Oklahoma City defense came into the series as the strongest in the league this year, one that was expected to be a deciding factor in the Finals, but the Pacers were able to do work on the defensive end of their own.', 'Through the first 33 minutes of the game, the Thunder were barely shooting more than 40% from the field. Forcing the Thunder into that poor shooting kept the Pacers in the game as the contest entered the final stretch.', 'A 10-3 run by the Pacers – capped off by a pair of 3-pointers from the Pacers’ Siakam and Thomas Bryant – cut the Thunder lead all the way down to six in the final seconds of the third quarter. But just before the buzzer could sound, Gilgeous-Alexander launched a 3-pointer of his own that ripped through the net as the horn went off, rebuilding the OKC lead to nine at the end of three quarters. The Canadian continued to play up to his regular season MVP status with 28 points through the first three quarters.', 'That three from Gilgeous-Alexander proved to be a massive momentum shift. As the Thunder opened up the quarter rebuilding their lead before Jalen Williams entered the fray in earnest. A star-in-the-making, Williams had been quiet most of the game but used cutting drives to get easy layups in the opening stages and intercepted a bad pass from McConnell to throw down a dunk on the fast break, building the lead to 15 points with a little less than 10 minutes to go in the game – the largest lead to that point. That steal was the 24th Indiana turnover of the night.', 'But much as they had against New York in the last series, the Pacers used the 3-pointer to drag themselves back into the contest. A quick 9-2 run shrank the lead down to eight after a 22-foot 3-pointer from Myles Turner quieted the OKC crowd. And Indiana wasn’t done there – two more 3-pointers from Turner and Obi Toppin helped cut the Thunder lead all the way down to four with a little more than six minutes left, setting up a tense close to the game.', 'As the game got under the five-minute mark, Haliburton hit a driving layup to make it 102-98 in favor of OKC and the Pacers got a stop on the defensive end. Turner had a wide open three to try and cut the lead to one but hit the back of the iron. Gilgeous-Alexander made sure that miss hurt; an incredible drive into the paint was finished off with a floating layup that gave the Thunder a six-point cushion.', 'After Haliburton missed a long three, it was once again the SGA show. Gilgeous-Alexander did what he does better than almost anyone in the league when he drew a foul on the Indiana star and got to the free-throw line. He made both his free throws to give his team a slightly more comfortable eight-point cushion.', 'Still the Pacers wouldn’t go away. A jumper from Aaron Neismith cut the lead back down to six. He grabbed a rebound on the ensuing possession as the clock ticked under two minutes to go and Andrew Nembhard drilled a 3-pointer to make it 108-05 in favor of Oklahoma City.', 'The Thunder’s Dort couldn’t hit a 3-pointer on the next time down the court for the Thunder but made what looked like the play of the game for his team when he blocked Nesmith’s driving layup with 93 seconds to go. That translated into a bucket for Gilgeous-Alexander to rebuild the lead before Nembhard hit two free throws to once again make it a one-possession game.', 'Gilgeous-Alexander looked to try and put the game away with another signature cutting drive, but Siakam filled the space and blocked his shot. The former Toronto Raptor wasn’t done there – when Nembhard’s 3-point attempt fell well short of the basket, he was in the right place at the right time to grab the rebound and get it in for a layup. That made the game 110-109 Oklahoma City in the final minute.', 'The Thunder’s next possession hinged on a critical review. The ball went out of bounds off of Siakam after a missed Gilgeous-Alexander shot, but the Pacers asked for the referees to review the play for a possible foul. They determined there was no foul on the play and the Thunder got the ball with a chance to extend their lead in the final seconds.', 'Gilgeous-Alexander missed the shot and the Pacers got the ball with no timeouts remaining. It was then that Haliburton got the ball at midcourt, drove just inside the 3-point line and pulled up – draining a 21-foot shot that caused the Oklahoma City crowd to fall absolutely silent. The Pacers had their first lead, 111-110.', 'There were .3 seconds left – enough time to get a shot off but not enough time to make it count. The Thunder’s last gasp attempt fell to the floor as time expired and the Pacers sprinted off the floor, having just pulled off an epic example of basketball larceny.', 'The Thunder will look to shake off the heartbreak on Sunday when the two teams meet again for Game 2.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Then again, why would any of them want to stick around and relish in what had just happened?', 'Pacers 111, Thunder 110.', 'That Indiana lead was the only Indiana lead of the night. It came, of course, on another Tyrese Haliburton game-winner. It erased, as you know, what had been a mostly glorious return to the NBA Finals for the Thunder.', '“Well, it sucks,” Thunder guard Jalen Williams said.', 'Succinct but brutally, painfully true for the hometown team.', 'This was a gut punch. A sneak attack. A shock to the system.', '“But we have been here before,” Williams continued, “obviously in the Denver series.”', 'True again. The Thunder lost the opener of the Western Conference semifinals in eerily similar fashion. Controlled the game for much of the night. Allowed the Nuggets to chip away at the lead. Lost on a last-second game-winner by Aaron Gordon.', 'Similar.', 'But different.', 'Very, very different. This, after all, is the NBA Finals. The stakes are much higher. Ditto for the pressure and the strain and the tension. Lose an opportunity in the NBA Finals, and it could cost you a crown.', 'Will it cost the Thunder?', 'Only time will tell, but the good news for the Thunder is that it has handled tough losses well in these playoffs. ', 'After that aforementioned heartbreaker courtesy of Gordon, the Thunder bounced back with a 43-point curb-stomping of the Nuggets.

While you have to take the lessons from the losses, you also have to be able to let go of the disappointment and the failure.', 'But Thursday was a failure on a stage that this Thunder bunch has never stood on.', 'For his part, Daigneault was preaching the same sermon as always.', ""“We’ve got to get ourselves to zero as we always do,” he said. “That's a habit that hopefully we've formed. These guys have made a habit of being able to get ourselves centered and play our best game in the next game."", '“We’ve got to improve like we would if we had won the game and get ourselves ready for Game 2.”', 'SGA was singing from the same hymnal, too.', ""“As much as we can, we’ve just got to treat it like every other game, every other situation we've been in,” he said. “Yes, we haven't been in this situation, but that doesn't mean our character has to change. "", ""“It's still basketball, the game of basketball we grew up playing. The rules don't change because we're in the Finals.”"", 'Clearly, the Thunder superstar wasn’t buying the idea this loss is different because it’s the Finals.', '“Me personally, how you lose doesn’t really matter,” he said.', 'Maybe that’s true. Perhaps the frustration of a blowout loss is the same as what we saw Thursday. But look in the eyes of the players, and there was shock. Pain. Anger. Disappointment.', 'Then again, being steamed about what happened isn’t necessarily bad.', ""“It’s all worth one, and that’s the silver lining of it, but at the same time, it’s a loss,” Caruso said, “and if we don't recognize that, feel that, if that doesn't hurt right now or like you're not frustrated with it, then obviously there's something wrong with you.”"", 'How the Thunder processes this game, uses this game, then responds to this game could decide this series.

Across Indiana's 17 postseason games, Haliburton, a two-time All-NBA honoree, is averaging 18.5 points, 9.5 assists, 5.9 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game, while shooting 46.6/33.1/80.4. Of course, the other side is that Haliburton has led the Pacers to the NBA Finals, and they now lead the Oklahoma City Thunder 1-0 after a fourth-quarter comeback that ended with him hitting a game-winning jump shot with 0.3 seconds remaining."", 'This has been the theme for Haliburton this spring: hitting game-winning jump shots, sending games to overtime and pulling off clutch moment after clutch moment.', ""Here are Haliburton's best moments of the 2025 NBA postseason."", 'Haliburton and the Pacers took down the Bucks in five games. (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)', 'The Pacers had the Milwaukee Bucks on the brink, leading the latter 3-1 in the series and having a closeout Game 5 on their home floor — and it turned out to be quite eventful.', ""Milwaukee led 103-99 with 53 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Then, Haliburton connected on a pair of free throws and tied the game with a dunk following a Bucks possession where they came up empty, and the game went to overtime. Haliburton had Indiana's last six points in regulation."", 'The Bucks were looking good in overtime. Even after a missed free throw by AJ Green, the one he knocked down gave Milwaukee a 118-111 lead with 40 seconds remaining. Then, it began to unravel. Andrew Nembhard hit a 3-pointer on the other end and then came up with a steal. Haliburton got an and-1 on the ensuing possession, and Milwaukee turned the ball over once again.', 'With the Pacers down by one, Haliburton brought the ball up the court and went around Giannis Antetokounmpo for a go-ahead layup with 1.3 seconds remaining. No miracle took place for the Bucks, and the Pacers finished off theirs to advance to the semifinals.', ""Haliburton finished with eight points in overtime, and 26 points, nine assists, five rebounds, three steals and three blocks for the game. It's the second consecutive season that the Pacers defeated the Bucks in the playoffs, with Indiana doing so in the first round last season."", 'The Pacers won three road games in the Eastern Conference semifinals.

This was probably the thought that crossed the state of Indiana's mind when Donovan Mitchell knocked down a pair of free throws to give Cleveland a 119-112 lead with 57 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter."", 'Then, it started. Aaron Nesmith got a dunk and then forced an offensive foul on Mitchell, which Indiana capitalized on with Pascal Siakam getting an inside bucket, getting the Pacers within three.
