The Pacers came in slightly older at 25.263, but the number is still below the league average for teams that make it to the Finals.', 'The youngest team to win a championship was the Portland Trail Blazers nearly 50 years ago, with the average age of the team being just 25.03.

The players themselves are aware of the shift this Finals represents. ', 'After the Pacers punched their ticket to the NBA Finals with a win in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals — their first trip to the Finals in 25 years — Myles Turner, who has been on the team the longest of anyone on the roster, reflected on what the 2025 playoffs could represent: ""It\'s a new blueprint for the league, man … I think the years of the super teams and stacking, it\'s not as effective as it once was.""', '""Since I\'ve been in the league, the NBA is very trendy. It just shifts,"" he said.

The fourth quarter featured a particularly snappy 12 minutes from the Pacers, which ended with Tyrese Haliburton firing off a final buzzer-beating shot that led Indiana to a 111-110 victory.', ""The Indiana Pacers, who haven't been to the Finals in 25 years, are shooting for their first-ever Championship. The Oklahoma City Thunder last appeared in the Finals in 2012, but they've yet to earn a title under their current name (the franchise originally debuted as the Seattle SuperSonics, under which they won the 1979 title).

But the Celtics lost their star, Jayson Tatum, to an Achilles injury. The Cavs then ran into the Pacers. ', ""Many dismissed the Pacers' run to the Eastern Conference Finals last season as a fluke that came from playing injured Bucks and Knicks teams. "", ""This series, though, the Bucks had their star tandem of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard for much of the first round, and it didn't stop the Pacers from beating them in a 4-1 gentleman's sweep. "", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""The Cleveland Cavaliers were the number one seed in the East, and had only one injury (Darius Garland's toe sprain) heading into the series. But even when Garland came back, the Cavaliers were still caught off guard by the Pacers. The series was highlighted by Tyrese Haliburton's stunning buzzer beater off of his own missed free throw to beat the Cavs at home in Game 2. The Pacers then went on to win the series 4-1. "", 'The New York Knicks were the third seed heading into the ECF and favorites to beat the Pacers. Right off the bat though, Indiana stole Game 1 in a historic rally (or collapse, if you\'re a Knicks fan) that saw the Pacers erase a 14-point lead in less than three minutes to force overtime. Haliburton again hit a key shot and used Reggie Miller\'s infamous ""choke"" taunt in celebration. The Knicks went on to win one in Indiana and one at home, but ultimately lost the series in Game 6. ', 'Just as the Cavs and Celtics were favorites to win the ECF, the Thunder have been the favorites to win it all the entire season. ', 'The Thunder have gotten to the Finals with a season-long dominance built on a historic defense. The Thunder are the first team to hold opponents to under 80 points in three separate games. ', 'OKC is led by the league MVP, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (""SGA""), who was the league\'s leading scorer. The 26-year-old Canadian plays point guard and averaged 39 points per game in the two meetings between the Thunder and the Pacers this year. ', ""Luguentz Dort is the other main guard for the Thunder. He's not the threat that SGA is, but he averaged 17 points per game against Indiana this season, and shot more than 41% from behind the 3-point line. "", 'At forward, Jalen Williams has been a prolific scorer for the Thunder, averaging 21 points a game in the regular season. Chet Holmgren is the starting power forward for OKC; he averaged 15 points and 8 rebounds per game in the regular season. ', ""Isaiah Hartenstein is a returning playoff villain for Pacers fans. He plays center for the Thunder, but last season, he played for the Knicks. He isn't a big scorer, but he averaged 10 rebounds per game in the regular season, an area where the Pacers have struggled. "", 'Indiana and Oklahoma City squared off twice during the regular season, with the Thunder winning both times.', 'On Dec. 26, SGA scored 45 points as the Thunder erased an early double-digit Pacers lead to win 120-114. Andrew Nembhard scored 23 for the Pacers, while Haliburton was held to a mere four points.', 'On March 29, SGA led in scoring again with 33 points as the Thunder picked up their ninth straight win, 132-111.

Although, the matchup isn't quite as lopsided as it may seem. "", 'After the All-Star break, the Thunder had a defensive rating of 110.4. That means for every 100 possessions, they gave up 110 points to opponents. In that same period, the Pacers had a defensive rating of 111.5, so they gave up just one more point per 100 possessions than the Thunder.

The Pacers shot 40.1% from three in the playoffs. That was the best in the league by a good amount, and much better than the 33.6% number the Thunder posted. ', ""In short? The Thunder have a very good defense that feasts on turnovers. The Pacers also have a very good defense and don't give up many points on turnovers. The Pacers have also been on fire from three, while the Thunder have struggled. "", 'The Thunder are still heavy favorites to win the championship, but Pacers certainly have a chance.

That wasn't the case in Game 1 of the series Thursday, however, when they were limited to a playoff-worst 110-point haul in the 111-110 loss. However, one thing the Thunder do well is bouncing back after a loss. The only time they lost at home in the current playoff run was a 121-119 loss to the Denver Nuggets, and in their next game, they responded by scoring 149 points. Given their need for a win and the fact that the Pacers play at a very high pace, I don't anticipate this game being a low-scoring matchup like Game 1. Even if the previous four home Thunder games in the playoffs have ended with under 228.5 total points, that streak should end here."", ""The Pacers not only covered the spread as the underdog in the series opener, but they ended up winning thanks to a late jumper from Tyrese Haliburton with 0.3 seconds left in the game. The Thunder are massive favorites for the second game of the series, which shouldn't be surprising given their impressive record at home and the fact that they also posted the best record in the league during the regular season. However, don't expect the Pacers to be blown out of this game. They have shown they can make fourth-quarter adjustments on a regular basis, and even if they look like they're going to lose, they'll do their best to turn things around and keep things close. The series could certainly shift to Indiana with a 1-1 score, but it wouldn't be surprising if the Pacers keep the differential to 10 points or fewer -- even if three of their four losses in this postseason run have come by double digits."", ""Simply put, the Thunder need Gilgeous-Alexander to bounce back and carry this team to a victory to avoid falling into a 2-0 hole with the series shifting to Indiana. The star floor general finished the series opener with 38 points (14-30 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 7-8 FT), five rebounds, three assists and three steals over 40 minutes during Thursday's 111-110 loss to the Pacers. Even though those 46 points + rebounds + assists wouldn't have been enough to hit the mark in this particular bet, Gilgeous-Alexander should have a good chance of doing so in Game 2 since he should handle a very high usage rate and is expected to lift the Thunder to victory here. It's worth noting that Gilgeous-Alexander has notched at least 46 points + rebounds + assists in each of his last three playoff appearances."", '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlhbW95Y21nNFZTMVJRMTluVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhaGxJcUx0UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

Still, the Thunder were -700 to win the title ahead of Game 1, so losing the series opener has certainly shifted things in favor of the Pacers.', 'This postseason, the Pacers are 7-2 on the road, and they’ve won six of their last seven road games. Their only loss on the road since the start of the second round came in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.

', 'Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.', 'Spread', 'Moneyline', 'Total', 'Pascal Siakam is averaging just 6.0 rebounds per game in the playoffs, but he grabbed 10 boards in Game 1 of this series with the Thunder opting to go smaller in their starting lineup.', 'OKC shied away from playing two bigs at the same time, leading to a massive advantage on the glass for the Pacers in the series opener.', 'What’s most interesting to me with this prop is that Siakam is averaging 10.9 rebound chances per game in the playoffs, but that number skyrocketed to 15.0 in Game 1. He responded by reaching double-digit boards for just the second time this postseason.', 'While I’m not expecting that again, I do think seven or more boards is in play for Siakam, who averaged 6.9 rebounds per game in the regular season.', 'This postseason, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is shooting just 31.4 percent from beyond the arc, but he’s knocked down at least two shots from deep in nine of his playoff games, including each of his last four.', 'In game 1, SGA attempted six shots from deep, hitting three of them.', 'While the Thunder don’t rely heavily on the league MVP shooting the ball from beyond the arc, he’s still attempting 5.1 shots per game from deep in the playoffs.', 'Given that volume, I think Gilgeous-Alexander is worth a look in Game 2 with a ton on the line for OKC. I expect SGA to come out aggressive as a scorer, and he did step into a few 3-pointers in transition in Game 1.

Does Mark Daigneault go back to his original starting lineup? ', 'There’s a lot more questions for OKC after playing a pretty decent game and still losing at home.

How the Thunder and Pacers outfoxed big-market super teams to reach NBA Finals,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/06/05/nba-finals-matchup-thunder-pacers/,"['Oklahoma City and Indiana needed years of savvy maneuvering to overcome their disadvantages as small-market franchises and reach the sport’s biggest stage.', 'OKLAHOMA CITY — The latest and loudest sign that this year’s NBA Finals matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers is an anomaly came Tuesday, when a tornado warning was issued in parts of Oklahoma as a massive thunderstorm moved across the state. The Pacers’ flight to Oklahoma City was diverted to Tulsa as a precaution, several out-of-market media members dealt with major delays, and NBA employees huddled in the basement of a downtown hotel as sirens blared outside. For many locals, this was just another day during a busy storm season. For uninitiated outsiders, the dark clouds, pouring rain, lightning strikes and flood warnings were disorienting and unnerving.', 'So began these upside-down Finals, which open with Game 1 on Thursday night and stand in direct opposition to the NBA’s long-standing conventional wisdom that the most famous and influential players shape the championship landscape by assembling super teams in glamorous coastal cities. This year, two small-market teams from the middle of the country have written impressive turnaround stories built on savvy trades and deep rosters rather than free agency power plays and overwhelming star power.', 'The Sports Moment newsletter', 'By Wednesday, the bad weather had passed, allowing the conference champions to safely assemble at Paycom Center. While Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, and Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, an electric two-time all-star, are worthy headliners, the Thunder and Pacers aren’t exactly overflowing with household names. This matchup is almost the exact opposite of then-NBA commissioner David Stern’s famous quip that his dream Finals would pit the Los Angeles Lakers against the Los Angeles Lakers.', 'But Adam Silver, Stern’s successor, has spent years preaching the virtues of “parity of opportunity” and, at the behest of NBA owners, reshaping the league’s salary cap rules to create a more level playing field for all 30 teams. The structural changes, which have included harsh luxury tax penalties and roster-building restrictions for the biggest spenders, have given new hope to teams such as the Thunder and Pacers, who have long struggled to land high-profile free agents. After LeBron James and Kevin Durant dominated the 2010s with their free agency decisions and star-laden powerhouses, the NBA is set to crown its seventh different champion in as many seasons.', 'Follow Sports', '“It’s a new blueprint for the league,” Pacers center Myles Turner said. “The years of the super teams and stacking [talent] is not as effective as it once was. ... The new trend now is what we’re doing. OKC does the same thing. The young guys get out and run, defend and use the power of friendship.”', 'The Thunder and Pacers can trace the roots of their success to a critical moment in NBA history: Durant’s decision to leave Oklahoma City to join Stephen Curry’s Golden State Warriors in 2016. The Thunder, which was rocked by its franchise player’s departure, learned the painful lesson that it was better to trade a disgruntled star and get something in return rather than watch him leave for nothing in free agency. The Pacers felt the downstream effect of Durant’s decision when all-star forward Paul George pushed his way out of Indiana to Oklahoma City in a 2017 trade.', 'George didn’t remain as Durant’s replacement in Oklahoma City for long. During the summer of 2019, the deep-pocketed Los Angeles Clippers concocted an all-in plan to pair George with Kawhi Leonard, a two-time Finals MVP. Thunder General Manager Sam Presti acquiesced, landing Gilgeous-Alexander — then coming off his rookie season — and a boatload of draft picks for George. Later that summer, Presti shipped Russell Westbrook, the 2017 MVP and a fan favorite, to the Houston Rockets for Chris Paul and another pile of draft assets.', 'By proactively moving George and Westbrook, Presti set the stage for a rebuilding cycle and added a veteran mentor in Paul, rather than risk distracting rumors about the uncertain futures of his stars. Though it took years for Presti’s vision to come together, Gilgeous-Alexander eventually blossomed into a franchise guard, and Jalen Williams arrived in 2022 thanks to one of the first-round picks acquired from the Clippers. Williams, a 23-year-old forward, has emerged as Gilgeous-Alexander’s co-star and earned his first all-star selection this season.', '“When I [was drafted], there was a ton of people outside the hotel waiting to see us and congratulate us,” Williams said. “I always compare us to a small local high school football team being really good and the city around them kind of gathers around them. Everywhere we go, I’ve been met with love since I’ve been out here.”', 'The Thunder, which won just 24 games in 2021-22, has filled out Gilgeous-Alexander’s supporting cast by drafting center Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 pick in 2022, trading for guard Alex Caruso last summer and then making use of its salary cap flexibility to sign center Isaiah Hartenstein.', 'Rather than assemble an expensive “Big Three” of prime-age stars on maximum contracts — as the Miami Heat did with James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the early 2010s — the Thunder is under the NBA’s luxury tax line of $170.8 million despite having a young and balanced roster that won 68 games and had the league’s No. 1 defense this season.', '“Those early [rebuilding] years were challenging,” Thunder Coach Mark Daigneault said. “How it felt every day was not a reflection of our record or where our standing was in the league. You could feel that some of the seeds we were planting were going to be flowering at some point. We were confident, even back then, that we were building something special and something that had the ability to sustain.”', 'The Pacers spun their wheels in the immediate aftermath of George’s 2017 departure, but they smartly flipped Domantas Sabonis, one of the pieces they got back from the Thunder, to the Sacramento Kings for Haliburton in 2022. When Indiana acquired Haliburton, less than two years after he was a 2020 lottery pick, Pacers President Kevin Pritchard hailed the young guard as the franchise’s answer to Peyton Manning, the Indianapolis Colts’ Hall of Fame quarterback. The fan base needed a jolt of hope given that Indiana finished the 2021-22 season with 25 wins.', 'Haliburton, like Gilgeous-Alexander, instantly gave his team an identity: The Pacers became a fast-and-loose offensive juggernaut, while the Thunder came to reflect Gilgeous-Alexander’s consistency and craftsmanship. Pritchard then set about finding players who would thrive in an up-tempo style, adding forwards Pascal Siakam, Aaron Nesmith and Obi Toppin in trades and selecting guard Andrew Nembhard in the 2022 draft.', '“[Presti] and Kevin Pritchard are two of the best franchise builders around,” Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle said. “I understand that there would be concern for how many people would watch because they’re smaller markets, but if we’re celebrating the game, it really shouldn’t matter.”', 'The Pacers put themselves in position to be contenders by landing Siakam from the Toronto Raptors in a January 2024 trade. At the time, he was heading for free agency and was viewed as a second-tier star. Indiana bet correctly that his athleticism and experience would be a good fit alongside Haliburton, and Pritchard’s careful management of the salary cap made it possible to grant Siakam a four-year, $189.5 million contract last summer without breaking the bank. In fact, the Pacers, like the Thunder, slid under the luxury tax line even though they possessed a solid rotation that featured 10 players who each logged at least 1,000 minutes.', 'Indiana was hampered by early-season injuries, but it still finished with 50 wins and top-10 rankings in offensive efficiency and pace. During the playoffs, the Pacers have gone 12-4 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks while ranking second in offensive efficiency and third in pace.', '“I don’t need the glitz and glamour of a large city,” Haliburton said. “I really like the small-town feel from our fans. I think [Oklahoma City] can relate to that. … [The Pacers] took a chance on me. Sometimes I think they saw more in me than I saw in myself. When we brought [Siakam] here, we envisioned doing something special. He’s been like a big brother for me. He’s somebody who can always keep me steady. [Going to the Finals] is what we got together to do.”', 'With James, Curry and Durant entering the twilight of their careers, the Thunder and Pacers have moved to center stage thanks to a pair of fortunate trades for their stars and a philosophy of collecting as many good and affordable players as possible to withstand the physical grind of a fast-paced era. Oklahoma City and Indiana avoided the pitfalls faced by Durant’s Phoenix Suns, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Bucks and Joel Embiid’s Philadelphia 76ers: They prioritized depth over top-end star power, so they aren’t one injury away from calamity.', 'The big-market behemoths will surely fight back. The Lakers landed Luka Doncic in a February blockbuster, and Antetokounmpo could alter the league’s landscape again if the Bucks trade him this summer.', 'For now, the Thunder and Pacers will savor their title shots despite the stormy start to Finals week: Oklahoma City hasn’t won a championship since relocating from Seattle in 2008, and Indiana has never won it all since joining the NBA from the rival American Basketball Association in 1976. Given how far they have come since Durant’s fateful decision in 2016, the Thunder and Pacers are well equipped to handle the elements.', '“To win a title on top of everything that happened this year would be special,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “I’ve been so focused on Game 1. Trying to be the best version of myself for this group and trying to make sure that we’re clicking on all cylinders on the biggest stage of our careers has been on the forefront of my mind.”', 'What readers are saying', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlhbW95Y21nNFZTMVJRMTluVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhaGxJcUx0UVk=-w280-h168-p-df

To others, it’s known as the fiscal Finals — a rare championship matchup between non-luxury-tax-paying teams.', 'On the court, it is a showdown between two of the league’s best guards, Thunder MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton.', 'Yet how these teams reached this point, just four victories from a title, can also be captured in a different way.', '“It’s the two hardest-playing teams in the NBA,” a Western Conference coach told NBC News.', ""Since Jan. 1, the Thunder own the NBA’s best record and the Pacers the second-best, in large part because of how each has blitzed the rest of the league through its frenetic pace and pressure. The Thunder's harassing defense has become one of the best in playoff history at forcing steals."", 'Indiana, meanwhile, plays as if driven to push the ball upcourt as fast as possible. It’s common for teams to play fast off opponents’ turnovers and missed shots — but the Pacers have lived up to their name by running hard even after made baskets, and in the process they have created flurries of scoring opportunities that have knocked off the Eastern Conference’s No. 1 (Cleveland) and No. 3 (New York) seeds en route to the team’s first Finals appearance in 25 years.', 'NBC News spoke with NBA insiders to help analyze the series, which begins with Thursday’s Game 1. All were afforded anonymity in exchange for their candor and analysis, which their teams don’t permit them to voice publicly.', 'The Pacers are “organized chaos,” said a scout for a Western Conference team. “They suck you into their style of play, where it’s not going to be a lot of defense but they’re just going to race the ball up and down the court, spread you out, shoot 3s, get to the basket, try to turn you over and just get in a rat race type of game. If you can match up with teams that struggle to do that, like New York, then you’re going to have a good chance to win.', '“The problem with Oklahoma City is they can play multiple ways. They enjoy playing fast, but they also can slow it down and use Shai in the halfcourt. It’ll be a chess match to see which style of play wins out. Who breaks first and wants to play one way and not the other?”', ""Oklahoma City, which won 68 regular-season games to earn the West’s top seed, was a heavy favorite to reach the Finals all season, even though it had the second-youngest roster ever to do so. The Thunder ranked No. 1 in defense during both the regular season and the postseason, owing to their phalanx of strong defenders. The challenge begins beyond the 3-point arc, where Lu Dort was successful during Oklahoma City's 2-0 record against Indiana during the regular season at limiting how often Haliburton touched the ball. The rim, meanwhile, is protected by Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren."", '“I think OKC is so strong defensively that they can kind of take you away from your first and second options,” an Eastern Conference scout said. “They’ve found a way to identify players that fit the modern style of play, which is being able to defend and shoot, and then you have obviously a transcendent MVP who can create opportunities for others.”', 'The West scout said some teams construct defenses around a few excellent players, while others try to elevate five otherwise average defenders through a system that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.', '“But I think with OKC, you’re getting kind of both,” the West scout said. “You’re getting great individual performance while also very well-connected with each other. And it shows in the off-the-court stuff with them, where they like being with each other, like playing for one another.”', 'Haliburton on Wednesday called the Thunder “historically great on both sides of the ball.”', '“This is the best team in the NBA,” he said. “It’s been the best team in the NBA all year. They’re well-coached. They just do everything so well. There’s no shortcuts to beating this team.”', 'Beating Indiana will require Oklahoma City to do the one thing no one has yet to do consistently — force the Pacers to beat themselves. Indiana\'s preferred pace is fast, yet it rarely turns the ball over. In the postseason, Indiana has gone 6-2 on the road by owning the highest road assist-to-turnover ratio, and it has assisted on a playoff-high 65% of its baskets because it plays lineups often with five players capable of hitting 3-pointers, including center Myles Turner, whose ability to shoot ""always messes teams up from a matchup perspective,"" the West coach said.', ""That offensive depth makes the Pacers trickier to guard than Oklahoma City's past playoff opponents; it could focus its defensive efforts to take away Ja Morant of Memphis, Nikola Jokić of Denver and Anthony Edwards of Minnesota. Though Oklahoma City is heavily favored to win the series, Indiana can't be underestimated, an executive for an Eastern team said."", '""They understand how they’re playing, and they’re very stubborn in their approach,"" he said. ""They kind of grind you with the way they play. They wear you down.""', 'Both franchises reflect the realities of the modern NBA, in which the league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players has instituted rules aimed at penalizing teams that build expensive rosters by making it harder to draft or make trades when their payrolls cross a certain threshold. Though Oklahoma City has a star in Gilgeous-Alexander and the Pacers claim Haliburton as their own, both have found success in building deep teams that can punish opponents by coming at them in waves of long arms and fresh legs.', '“It’s why the day of the aging superstar will be over in the next two years,” the West coach said. “Indiana’s best talent for the majority of their roster is how hard they play. TJ McConnell, Aaron Nesmith, Benedict Mathurin, throw Pascal Siakam in there — they’re just junkyard dogs, and they do it every single night.”', 'Andrew Greif is a sports reporter for NBC News Digital.

NBA finals 2025 predictions: will the Pacers shock the Thunder? Our writers share their picks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/nba-finals-2025-predictions-thunder-pacers,"['Will it be Oklahoma City or Indiana? Our contributors pick the winner, key players and dark horses before the season’s grand finale tips off Thursday night', 'The Thunder’s path to victory is to continue to be the most fearsome defensive unit we’ve seen in recent years. They play an uber-aggressive, hyper-switchable form of defense that has suffocated opponents all year long. It means they give up a lot of fouls, but they also get away with a bunch and force turnovers more than anyone else in the league. Keep that up and, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander getting his customary 32 points a night, they won’t be stopped. Ryan Baldi', 'It may sound overly simplistic to say make shots, but if Oklahoma City don’t end up hoisting the trophy when all is said and done, it will be because they, quite frankly, did not. They are the better team by every metric, with the better best player, better defense, and home court advantage. But their jump shot has been their only achilles. If shots fall, so will the confetti when all is said and done. Claire de Lune', 'Set the tempo and harry Tyrese Haliburton. OKC thrive on dictating pace and forcing turnovers, the sort of pressure that Indiana’s disciplined offense has yet to face at this intensity in the postseason. With waves of defenders like Lu Dort, Jalen Williams, Alex Caruso and Cason Wallace swarming the ball on the perimeter and inside, the Thunder can derail the Pacers’ rhythm, cool their three-point barrage and win the possession battle. If they do that, SGA will take care of the rest. Bryan Armen Graham', 'Play their game and take the Pacers out of theirs. The Thunder thrive in transition. If they can shut down Halliburton and Pascal Siakam and turn those defensive stops into easy buckets, they control the series. Their roster is so deep, so talented, so high-energy and so well-coached that you wonder if anything short of an act of god will deny them in their quest for the franchise’s second championship. Andrew Lawrence', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'They need to keep playing fast and take care of the ball. It’s something they are remarkably good at: they have the third-lowest turnover rate in the league. But they’re up against a turnover juggernaut and an outstanding transition defense. This could be an irresistible-force-v-immovable-object type of deal. RB', 'While they’re an indisputably great team, Pacers are, in many ways, a lesser version of their finals adversary, the Thunder. To win it all, their best players are going to have to bring it. They need sensational star performances from Siakam and Haliburton, and they need them nightly. That, and to not turn the ball over. That’s something they’re typically fantastic at, but that the Thunder are even more fantastic at disrupting. CDL', 'Keep the ball moving and keep their composure. Indiana lead the playoffs in three-point shooting percentage and rarely turn the ball over: two trends need to preserve under OKC’s relentless pressure. Haliburton’s turnover-averse style will be tested like never before. If the Pacers can maintain their pace and exploit mismatches when the Thunder go small, Siakam’s versatility could help tilt the series in their favor. BAG', 'Get boards, something they struggled to do all season and could well struggle to do again against the Thunder’s foreboding frontline. But if Siakam, Turner, and Benedict Mathurin are willing to get scrappy in the paint, they might find that they actually have a toughness advantage over Oklahoma City’s “tall” men. AL', 'Give Adam Silver a dose of truth serum and I’m sure he’ll tell you he was rooting for the Knicks to get to the finals. This one probably isn’t going to break any viewership records. But it is a fascinating match-up between two unique teams with a star of the league on either side. What’s not to love? RB', 'There’s this weird, very online plague of the “Couch GM” that seems to be constantly preoccupied with NBA ratings, as if they directly affect their own lives in any meaningful way. The truth is, they don’t even affect the NBA itself much: a new $76bn television rights deal was just negotiated and expansion is coming. The league will be just fine, even if the casual fan doesn’t find an Indianapolis v Oklahoma City final scintillating. True basketball diehards know this should be a wildly entertaining series. CDL', 'Only if you think TV ratings matter more than basketball. This is a stylistic dream matchup between two fearless, homegrown teams. The NBA should celebrate franchises that built smartly and play joyfully. This series is a vindication of substance over star-chasing. BAG', 'Only for the small-minded. Indiana have an NBA pedigree and a state basketball lore that would make for an epic underdog story and a great redemption story for Rick Carlisle, who may well have won his lone NBA title in his first stint with the Pacers if the Malice at the Palace hadn’t happened. As for Oklahoma City, they certainly didn’t have trouble attracting a crowd when Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden were leading the championship charge. (Sure, they were facing the Heatles, but still.) Even old-timers like me, who still feel like this slickly run operation should be in Seattle, won’t be able to stay away just because we’ve been invested in this story for too long and need to see where it ends. AL', 'Mark Daigneault was Coach of the Year in 2024 and probably should have won it again this year. But Rick Carlisle is a former Coach of the Year, too. And although his award came more than two decades ago, his work in Indiana has proven he remains one of the league’s best. And Carlisle has one thing that Daigneault does not: championship experience. The edge goes to the old guy. RB', 'This one is actually a push. Carlisle obviously has the more storied resumé and the championship pedigree, but Daigneault’s Coach of the Year win last season was well deserved: he’s done a bang-up job of getting the youngest roster in the NBA to buy into the egoless, defense-driven identity that made them a 68-win team on the doorstep of a championship. CDL', 'Mark Daigneault, just. Carlisle may have the best total body of work of any coach that’s not in the Hall of Fame (yet), but Daigneault’s adaptability and calm control have guided OKC’s young core beyond expectations. He’s leaned into their defensive versatility and late-game composure: two areas that could tilt the margins in a long series. BAG', 'Mark Daigneault. He who has the best players has the advantage. AL', 'Aaron Nesmith came into the league with a reputation as a deadly three-point shooter, only for his shooting to desert him in his first stop in Boston. With the Pacers, he’s reinvented himself as a lockdown wing defender who plays with OKC-like intensity. And he came make shots now, too. RB', 'Andrew Nembhard, the third year guard out of Gonzaga, is probably a name with which the average NBA fan is unfamiliar. But if the Pacers are able to pull off a shocking upset in this series, it will almost certainly be, in part, due to Nembhard’s key contributions on the defensive end. The defensive pest had Jalen Brunson in the seventh circle of hell in the Eastern Conference finals, and he’ll need to bring the same pressure against Gilgeous-Alexander for Indiana to have a chance in this series. CDL', 'Jalen Williams. Everyone talks about his defense and playmaking, but he’s due for a scoring breakout. With Indiana selling out on SGA, Williams will feast on open threes and scrambled closeouts. If he starts hitting at his usual clip (38.2% career from deep), OKC’s offense becomes near unguardable. BAG', 'Alex Caruso. Talk about a man who contains multitudes: Caruso doesn’t just keep the OKC offense on pace when SGA is out of the game while providing elite defense. (His shackling of Nikola Jokić helped the Thunder pip Denver in the West semi-finals.) He’s the veteran in the Thunder huddle with championship experience, winning his ring with LeBron’s Lakers inside the Covid bubble in 2020. If at any point the young Thunder begin to doubt themselves, the Carushow will be where they turn to for succor. AL', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. It’s the consistency. The foul-baiting can be grating but it’s impossible not to admire how SGA appears to have figured out the game of basketball over the last couple of seasons. He has his spots and he knows exactly how to get to them. It’s also nice to see a masterful offensive guard who isn’t a complete zero on the other side of the ball. RB', 'It is rare for a player to win both regular season and NBA finals MVP in the same season; it’s only happened 15 times in league history. But Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the slinky, shifty guard with shades of Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant in his deep bag, is about to do it. While Oklahoma City have a deep team, and both Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren have gotten shine this postseason, if they win it all, it will be on the back of Gilgeous-Alexander, and he’ll get rewarded accordingly. CDL', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He’s been the steadiest closer in the playoffs, turning midrange mastery and calm isolation into winning basketball. If Oklahoma City win the title, it will be because SGA took over in crunch time and made the leap from All-NBA to undeniable superstar. BAG', 'Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He’s been dominant all season, and his playoff level has yet to drop. In his two regular-season games against Indiana, he averaged 39 points (on 56% shooting), seven boards and eight assists against one turnover – total. Put simply: this is his year, and he won’t be denied. AL', 'Thunder in five. They’ve been utterly dominant all season. That’s mostly been the case for the playoffs too, allowing for some Jokić magic in the second round. The Pacers have been a ton of fun to watch, have impressive depth and a rising star in Haliburton. But the Thunder are deeper, more talented and have the best player in the series – that’s a recipe for a gentleman’s sweep. RB', 'Thunder in five. If the Pacers had drawn literally any other Western Conference foe, I would give them a better chance in this series. But unfortunately for Indiana, they drew, in my estimation, the far better version of themselves. Indiana is great at forcing turnovers: Oklahoma City do that better. Indiana take great care of the ball: OKC even moreso. The Thunder have the MVP, the better defense, the better bench. They have been the best team in the league at home this season, and they have home-court advantage in this series. While the Pacers’ run to the finals has been impressive all the way, and I see them winning a game, I think the Thunder will make relatively quick work of them en route to a Larry O’Brien. CDL', 'Pacers in seven. I picked the Thunder at the start of the playoffs (flex) and my inner Dean Oliver is still inclined to think their historically good metrics will see them through. But management wants someone to make the case for Indiana so here we go. The Pacers’ blistering pace, surgical ball movement and deep rotation give them a real shot at disrupting Oklahoma City’s rhythm. Haliburton’s vision fuels an attractive, crowd-pleasing offense that doesn’t rely on isolation or volume threes. If they can turn it into a track meet while taking care of the ball like they have all year, Indiana’s chaos could outlast OKC’s control. BAG', 'Thunder in six. Again: they’re loaded, high-energy, extremely well-coached and hungry as hell. Denver needed the world’s best player to take OKC to seven games. While the Pacers have their virtues, and a bona fide go-to guy in Halliburton, they don’t have enough to stop a team that seems like it has been on an inexorable march toward a championship since the season tipped off in October. For me, the question isn’t if Thunder will win, but whether GM Sam Presti can keep this squad together long enough to make a dynastic run for the ages.

What key plays from Thunder-Pacers Game 1 tell us about the NBA Finals going forward,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6409065/2025/06/07/thunder-pacers-takeaways-nba-finals-game-2/,"['NBA', 'NBA Finals', '84', 'OKLAHOMA CITY — So … what exactly happened here, and what does it mean going forward?', 'That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out ever since I staggered out of Paycom Center late Thursday in the wake of the Indiana Pacers’ stunning 111-110 comeback win against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.', '', 'It wasn’t just that the Pacers rallied from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit; it was the way they came back. Oklahoma City seemed to be dominating, forcing a series of JV-playing-the-varsity-type turnovers in the first half and seemingly coasting behind its NBA MVP in the second. But somehow, the size of the Thunder lead never quite matched the eye-test vibes, and the Pacers stayed close enough for a late stretch of hot shooting and sprinkling of Tyrese Haliburton clutch fairy dust to put them on top.', 'In the wake of my bewilderment, I rewatched the game Friday morning and compared it to my notes on what I thought I saw from my perch Thursday. Watching again left me with a lot of random thoughts about some fairly important things that went under the radar: Aaron Nesmith’s ironclad perimeter defense, Rick Carlisle’s creative play-calling (corner iso for T.J. McConnell? Triple drag to get Nesmith an open 3?), the forces of nature that were Lu Dort and Alex Caruso, the incredibly random Ajay Mitchell cameo and more.', 'But I can’t do play-by-play from the whole game, so let’s narrow things down. In particular, 10 plays stand out as important ones that defined not only why the Pacers came back and won but what the strategic questions will be for both teams Sunday in Game 2 and beyond.', 'A harbinger of what was to come for the Thunder came on this free-throw miss. Nembhard tipped out a rebound, Pascal Siakam retrieved the ball while Cason Wallace recovered from presumably falling off the edge of the earth on the left side of our TV screens, and Siakam blew to the rim for a bucket over an MIA-for-the-night Chet Holmgren.', 'This play encapsulated several underlying themes from the game: Siakam’s quietly great play, the struggles of Holmgren and Wallace and Nembhard making subtle big plays.', '', 'But the one I want to focus on is rebounding. The Thunder were a terrible rebounding team last year, and when Isaiah Hartenstein wasn’t on the floor, they mostly remained a terrible rebounding team this year. With Hartenstein removed from the starting lineup and only playing 17 minutes in Game 1, guess what they were terrible at? Indiana had 13 offensive rebounds, even while sometimes staying small themselves, and this play was illustrative. It was also an omen for an even bigger play later.', 'Oklahoma City should have been up by 20 at halftime after forcing 19 Indiana turnovers and holding the Pacers to 45 first-half points. The reason the Thunder weren’t was that their offense kept leaving money on the table.', 'Much was made of the lack of points off turnovers, but a lot of them were turnovers that weren’t particularly conducive to quick baskets. The Thunder also missed an unusually large number of shots at the rim, going just 8-of-22 in the restricted area in the first half; give Myles Turner some credit, as he played a major role in several of the misses.', 'The other issue for the Thunder was how many not-great quick jump shots they were taking. In part, this was because the Pacers were able to guard one-on-one on the perimeter without sending much help; Nembhard on Gilgeous-Alexander and Nesmith on Jalen Williams were both up to the task.', 'Beyond that, the lack of minutes for Hartenstein took the Thunder’s best screener out of the game, and that made it harder to get bodies off their two best scorers. In theory, the Thunder were playing five-out, but they weren’t running much of anything.', 'Rewatching this game, it was shocking how many zero- and one-pass possessions the Thunder had. This is a fairly indulgent one by Gilgeous-Alexander, who tilted too heavily toward hunting quick jumpers, but at least he’s the MVP. The ones initiated by secondary players were even more egregious; remind me again why Wallace is trying to cook with 17 seconds on the shot clock?', 'All that presaged the final possession for the Thunder, when Gilgeous-Alexander did the same and got a decent jump shot but also missed an open Williams at the top of the key.', 'In this clip, Nembhard drove to the cup with Holmgren in perfect position to snuff his shot at the rim, and then Holmgren … just kind of watched Nembhard lay it in. While this play also stood out for the cleaner ball movement Indiana had in the second half — quicker actions, fewer passes, not trying to seal bigs and thread entries in traffic — that cleared up the Pacers’ plague of turnovers, the bigger point here is the Thunder just need way, way more from Holmgren.', '', 'Holmgren can be pretty hard on himself, and I imagine he’s gnashing his teeth watching film of his game. He finished 2-of-9 from the field with no assists, and the eye test might have been worse.', 'Credit Turner for stymying several of Holmgren’s forays to the rim, and (dis)credit the Thunder’s offensive impatience for taking him out of the game as a secondary offensive player. Holmgren is at his best when the ball swings to him against a rotating defense or he’s able to finish a play at the rim, but with Oklahoma City in hero-ball mode, his offense took a major hit.', 'But we can’t let him off the hook. He was a non-factor protecting the rim and on the glass, even with the Thunder switching his matchup to keep him off Turner and let him roam a bit more. The biggest reason for Thunder optimism going forward is that Holmgren and Jalen Williams should both be way better in future games; that’s especially true of Holmgren on defense.', 'Another look at this MONSTER block by Benn ⤵️ https://t.co/oCsghcnBn1 pic.twitter.com/dr2JhyLrWg', '— NBA (@NBA) June 6, 2025', '', 'Mathurin didn’t play a lot in Game 1, but he held up very well at both ends. This spectacular block of Williams’ drive was the highlight and underscored a 6-of-19 shooting night from Williams when he also missed multiple assist chances. Look at Mathurin’s man, Hartenstein, under the rim; if Williams either drops this off or lobs it, it’s a dunk.', 'Williams lamented after the game that a lot of the shots he missed were normal shots for him that just didn’t go down. Certainly, there are elements of truth to that, particularly in his pull-up game. However, his Game 1 performance left a lot to be desired as a secondary offensive weapon and brought up reminders of his “spring tour dates” in the Denver series (2-of-13; 3-of-15; 5-of-14; 5-of-20) and his struggles to be a secondary weapon against the Dallas Mavericks a year ago.', 'Again, one wonders if more Hartenstein as a screener might have helped; the two had a solid run at the start of the fourth quarter with the help of some road-grader screens from Hartenstein. Regardless, Oklahoma City’s “other” All-Star is a huge key to this series. While Indiana got all it needed and more from its No. 2 guy in Siakam, Williams left the Thunder short in that respect. That can’t be the case going forward.', 'On this play, Hartenstein got Nembhard off Gilgeous-Alexander’s body with a solid screen, cooking a switch that leaves the MVP guarded by the highly cookable Thomas Bryant. It went down as a jump shot, but these were some of the easiest points of the night for a player of SGA’s caliber.', '', 'As I noted above, the Thunder missed a ton of paint shots, and on the night, they missed a staggering 40 2s — making only 41.2 percent inside the arc. That’s how they barely averaged a point per possession despite shooting 21 of 24 from the free-throw line and making a respectable 11 triples.', 'These stretches, where Hartenstein was setting ball screens for Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams, were the Thunder’s best offensive forays. Hartenstein sprang both Thunder All-Stars downhill for layups with the help of Gortat screens that stopped his own man from helping. He also set up weakside mayhem with short rolls and quick kickouts and even aggressively took a few handoff plays to the cup himself in the first half.', 'There’s a reason Hartenstein didn’t play longer, which I’ll get to in a minute, but one major adjustment for the Thunder for Game 2 has to involve increasing his role; he’s just too important to both their offense and rebounding, the two areas in which they lost Game 1. That’s particularly true since his replacement, Wallace, had little impact in 33 minutes replacing him.', 'This play precipitated Hartenstein’s removal, as he lost track of Turner at the 3-point line. The Thunder were already leery of starting Hartenstein because they were worried about him getting isolated in space against Haliburton, but the death knell for his evening was all the 3-pointers Indiana’s stretch bigs got at his expense. It started late in the first quarter when he and Kenrich Williams messed up a zone scheme that left Obi Toppin with a practice 3-pointer from above the break, but the situation escalated in the second half.', 'This Turner shot was the third in a series of similar errors; Hartenstein also let Bryant and Toppin get free for catch-and-shoot 3s in the second half, which is why Thunder coach Mark Daigneault took him out for good with 7:44 left after Turner’s make. (Bizarrely, the Thunder didn’t even put him back in with 0.3 seconds left when they could only score on a lob. What did they think Wallace was going to do on that play?)', 'The “play better” adjustment looms large here. Hartenstein’s instincts will always be to protect the rim, but he can’t lose the assignment so regularly if he’s going to stay on the court longer.', 'The Pacers were trying to deny Gilgeous-Alexander catches in the backcourt and pressure his dribble all game, even handing over two free points at the end of the first quarter when Nembhard needlessly fouled him 75 feet from the hoop with the Thunder in the bonus.', '', 'In the fourth, however, it started paying off. On this play, the MVP tapped out on getting the inbound pass after a Pacers basket, and the ball went to Holmgren instead, who decided to call his own number and attack Turner at the cup. The shot failed, and Holmgren was done for the night shortly after this, with the Thunder playing five smalls for the final 3:24 until Holmgren returned with 0.3 seconds left.', 'Logically, as I rewatched, this was the only thing that made sense for OKC. Holmgren was terrible, and Hartenstein was a 3-pointer waiting to happen, which is no bueno sitting on a multi-possession lead. Moreover, that same unit of five smalls finished the first half and tortured the Pacers, forcing an avalanche of Indiana turnovers.', 'Remember that missed Nembhard free throw above? This will awaken some ghosts for Thunder fans since it was also a massive factor in their Game 6 loss to Dallas a year ago.', 'And it was why Caruso stepped in early on the second free throw by Siakam with 3:24 left. Hartenstein, the Thunder’s best rebounder, was out, and Caruso was the closest thing left to a “big.” (Holmgren would have been useless here as well; he gets shoved into the stanchion on every foul shot.) Caruso knew that Jalen Williams on the other side would get caved in by Nesmith, and nobody else on the court was an instinctive rebounder. (Caruso, who played 28 minutes, also might have run out of gas in the fourth; he was uncharacteristically cooked off the dribble multiple times.)', 'Siakam missed the free throw, and a lane violation was called, giving him another one that he ended up converting. That point ended up being massive given the one-point final difference.', 'But hey, it could have been worse. I joke that the best offense against Oklahoma City is missing a foul shot, but there’s a kernel of truth; when Hartenstein and Jaylin Williams aren’t on the floor, they are supernaturally bad at this for an otherwise historically awesome team.', 'Check this out: On that third free throw, Caruso ended up boxing out air and nearly fell over, and Nesmith again caved in Jalen Williams. Look at the Pacers’ rebounding position if Siakam had missed again:', '', 'One other issue with Oklahoma City playing small is Caruso in the dunker spot instead of, say, a dunker; if it’s Hartenstein or Holmgren, the image above is an easy lob to the square for two points. Instead, Siakam blocked this shot, and he’s able to because Gilgeous-Alexander had no realistic lob option as he came down the pike.', '', 'If there’s one aspect of this that Daigneault might be replaying in his head, it’s likely whether he could have closed with a bit more size in his “small” group by using Kenrich Williams instead of Wallace. Wallace shot 3 of 9, playing 33 lightly impactful minutes and finishing with a plus/minus of minus-13. Kenrich Williams, meanwhile, played 27 very effective minutes when Holmgren missed OKC’s late March blowout win over Indiana, finishing a team-best plus-23 that night; he would have added a bit more size, screening and rebounding to this look.', 'Here’s the thing, though: Oklahoma City’s small group did fine down the stretch if you just look at the shots they took and allowed. In a vacuum, over the last four minutes, they probably had better ones than the Pacers. Nembhard made an and-1 mixtape 3-pointer, Nesmith made one that he shot like the ball was on fire while he was still moving, and of course, minutes earlier, Turner banked in a 3 by accident. Meanwhile, Dort, Jalen Williams and Wallace all missed catch-and-shoot fungoes.', 'The Thunder were 0-of-9 outside the charge circle in the fourth quarter; the Pacers were 9-of-14. Make-or-miss league, as they say. Sometimes it happens even if the strategy and process are fine.', 'For the most part, the real problem wasn’t the 12-2 run at the end; it was the fact that Oklahoma City hadn’t amassed a much greater lead before.', 'HALIBURTON WINS GAME 1 FOR THE PACERS.', 'THEY TRAILED BY 15.', 'ANOTHER CRAZY INDIANA COMEBACK 🚨 https://t.co/heI0ELIivW pic.twitter.com/1Qr6XlDbA7', '— NBA (@NBA) June 6, 2025', '', 'Yeah … this was something.', 'As I noted above, at the start of the play, it looked like Gilgeous-Alexander had a chance to hit Jalen Williams for a dagger 3. Also, props to Carlisle for not calling a timeout and letting Haliburton work against a scrambled defense.', 'That “scrambled” part stands out in one sense: Dort is matched up with Haliburton when the shot goes up, but he didn’t pick him up at the other end. Dort chases the offensive rebound despite not exactly leading the league in this category and doesn’t chase back to regain the matchup. Haliburton ends up with the less stout Wallace on him. Making matters worse, Wallace doesn’t get into his dribble and doesn’t force him left, even though Haliburton is a more comfortable pull-up shooter going to his right.', 'That should have been clear to the Thunder if they watched some of Haliburton’s tape. Here’s Game 1 of the first round against the Milwaukee Bucks, for instance, with a virtually identical shot to end the third period when Haliburton gets a chance to cook against Bobby Portis.', 'This play, however, was probably the least relevant thing going forward for the rest of this series. It was a one-point game in the final minute, and then Gilgeous-Alexander missed his pull-up and Haliburton made his.', 'Big picture, the Thunder have to feel decent even though Indiana stole the result. Oklahoma City dominated big chunks of the game, made a series of very fixable mistakes to let Indiana back in it, has obvious tactical alternatives it could put into play and was in position to win the game despite very poor outings from its second- and third-most important players. On the other hand, the Thunder gave away a game they had in the bag, and there’s no guarantee they defend as well going forward as they did in the first half of Game 1.', '', 'Given what an overwhelming favorite the Thunder were coming into this series, and the fact that they survived a similar late collapse against Denver, I still would rather hold their cards; aspects of this game reminded me of the Philadelphia 76ers’ Game 1 win over the Los Angeles Lakers in 2001 or the Miami Heat’s Game 2 win at Denver in 2023.', 'Nonetheless, what’s good for all of us (we have a series!) is probably not great for Oklahoma City. Game 2 is now a must-win, and the pressure carries over from there to win at least once in Indiana. This was entirely avoidable, and how the two teams resolve the questions above will go a long way toward telling us what happens next.', '(Illustration: Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; top photos: Alonzo Adams, Kyle Terada/Imagn Images, Julio Cortez-Pool, William Purnell/Getty Images)', 'John Hollinger ’s two decades of NBA experience include seven seasons as the Memphis Grizzlies’ Vice President of Basketball Operations and media stints at ESPN.com and SI.com.

The pick: Thunder -11"", ""There was a lot of talk after Game 1 about how the Thunder failed to turn their turnovers into points, but it actually makes quite a bit of sense on paper. The Pacers allowed the second-fewest fast-break points in the NBA this season. They are fast and they don't overcommit to offensive-rebounding, so their defense off of turnovers is almost as good as it gets. But the team that allowed the fewest fast-break points this season? The Thunder, who are even faster and deeper than the Pacers. If the easy stuff in transition is gone, you're basically betting on outlier shooting to hit the over. The Pacers got outlier shooting in Game 1, making 18-of-39 3-pointers, and this was still comfortably an under. Game 2 should be as well. The pick: Under 228.5"", ""Isaiah Hartenstein had nine rebounds in 17 minutes in Game 1. His line is significantly lower, and that's a function of playing time. He was removed from the Game 1 starting lineup. But considering the way Game 1 went, he's probably going to be in line for more minutes even if he remains on the bench in Game 2. Those easy points off of turnovers that the Thunder live off of might not be available, so they might need to emphasize rebounding more to maintain their dominance in the possession game. They got around 53% of available rebounds in Game 1 during Hartenstein's minutes, but only around 39% when he was off of the floor. I'm expecting more Hartenstein in Game 2, so I'm going over on his rebounds. The pick: Hartenstein over 6.5 rebounds"", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

After winning 68 games in the regular season and cruising past Minnesota in five games in the Western Conference finals with three wins by double-digits, including a 30-point victory in Game 5, it’s no surprise to see the Thunder as favorites.', '', 'For context, the Thunder were -350 to beat Minnesota, -800 to get by Denver in the second round and an even more dominant -2000 to beat Memphis in the first round. Considering Denver took the Thunder to a Game 7 and the Timberwolves only won one game, the odds haven’t correlated with how competitive the series have been.', '', 'Not only is Oklahoma City clearly expected to win, but the odds also point to a short series. According to BetMGM’s odds, the most likely outcome is the Thunder winning in five games, which pays out at +200.

He finished with 32 points, 15 assists and no turnovers in a comfortable victory that gave Indiana a 3-1 series lead."", ""That last stat -- turnovers -- will be one of the key battlegrounds in this series. Oklahoma City's defense, the best in the league by a wide margin this season, excels at turning teams over. Haliburton, on the other hand, is the best point guard at avoiding turnovers in the NBA."", 'Previous ranking: 5', 'Jalen Brunson stands tall for New York as the Knicks overcome the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 to keep the series alive.', '2025 playoff stats (18 games): 29.4 PTS | 7.0 AST | 3.4 REB', ""While Brunson's defense was a problem in New York's loss to Indiana (and he had a disappointing Game 6 to end the Knicks' season), there's no denying his importance in leading the franchise to its best season in a quarter century. Brunson, the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year this season, averaged 30.7 points and shot over 50% from the field against the Pacers. That his performance overall was seen as a disappointment is indicative of the elevated status he has reached as a player."", ""Brunson's first three seasons in New York have already launched him into the top five careers in Knicks franchise history, and there's a pretty sound argument there are only three players -- all Hall of Famers -- ahead of him: Willis Reed, Patrick Ewing and Walt Frazier. Not bad company for the former second-round pick whom New York signed as an unrestricted free agent."", 'Previous ranking: 1', ""Take a look at some of Pascal Siakam's best plays as Eastern Conference finals MVP."", '2025 playoff stats (16 games): 21.1 PTS | 5.8 REB | 3.3 AST | 46.3 3P%', 'The Eastern Conference finals MVP, Siakam -- who had 30 points in three of the six games against the Knicks and averaged 24.8 across the series -- has fit in beautifully since arriving in Indiana 18 months ago, powering the franchise first to the conference finals last year and now back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2000.', ""The symbiosis between Haliburton and Siakam has played a huge part in the Pacers becoming the high-powered offensive machine they have been for the past couple seasons, especially during these two playoffs runs. Matching that effort against the Thunder, however, is going to be Indiana's biggest challenge yet."", 'Previous ranking: NR', 'Nikola Jokic scored 44 points to go along with 15 boards, but the Nuggets fall to the Thunder 112-105.', '2025 playoff stats (14 games): 26.2 PTS | 12.7 REB | 8.0 AST | 2.0 STL', ""Surprised to see Jokic here despite Denver's loss in the second round of the playoffs?

That, coupled with Jokic's always comical stats, still has him pretty high on this list even though he has been home for a couple of weeks already."", 'Previous ranking: 2', 'Jalen Williams impresses with 34 points as OKC beats the Timberwolves 128-126 to take a 3-1 series lead.', '2025 playoff stats (16 games): 20.4 PTS | 5.8 REB | 5.3 AST | 1.6 STL', ""Williams struggled for large portions of Oklahoma City's second-round victory over Denver, but he came back and had a terrific West finals, shooting just under 50% from the field, 46.2% from 3 and averaging 22.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 2.0 steals."", ""One of the big questions about Oklahoma City all season, in terms of its ability to contend for a title, was whether Williams could reliably step into the role as the secondary scorer behind Gilgeous-Alexander on a championship-level team. And while that has been a struggle at times in these playoffs, he showed in Game 4 of the Minnesota series in particular -- he had 34 points in perhaps the finest game of his career to help the Thunder take a 3-1 series lead -- that he's growing into that spot right in line with OKC's title window."", 'Previous ranking: NR', 'Anthony Edwards notches 30 points with 9 rebounds and 6 assists as the Timberwolves rout the Thunder in Game 3.', '2025 playoff stats (15 games): 25.3 PTS | 7.8 REB | 5.5 AST', ""Oklahoma City showed an appropriate fear of Edwards throughout the West finals, sending swarms of defenders at him in an effort to force passes to his teammates and make them beat the Thunder instead.

That happened only once across the opening two rounds of the playoffs."", 'Still, Edwards leading the Timberwolves to the conference finals in back-to-back seasons after the franchise had only one previous series win is an impressive accomplishment.

But, like Brunson, Towns struggled defensively and with foul trouble, which Indiana repeatedly took advantage of as it dispatched New York and denied the Knicks a trip to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1999.', ""Towns' first season in New York has to be seen as a success, however. He was an All-NBA player and earned his fifth All-Star appearance while helping the Knicks reach the conference finals for the first time in 25 years.

With the teams tied at 1-1, the series moves to Indiana for Game 3 on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. ET. In four games against the Pacers this season, league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has scored 45, 33, 38, and 34 points. Will Indiana be able to slow him down on their home court? The Thunder are 5-point road favorites in Game 3 with the over/under at 228 points in the latest Thunder vs. Pacers odds. Oklahoma City is a -198 favorite (risk $198 to win $100) on the money line, while Indiana is a +164 underdog (risk $100 to win $164) for anyone finalizing how to bet Thunder vs. Pacers Game 3.', 'Before making any Thunder vs. Pacers picks, be sure to see the Game 3 NBA score prediction and Game 3 NBA picks from SportsLine expert Eric Cohen.

Unlike Game 2, Wednesday night's game will be close throughout, but I think the Thunder steals one on the road. Sunday's contest flew over in the second half but I would be very surprised if we saw anything close to 130 points in the third and fourth quarters this time around so the under is preferred. League MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to torch Indiana and the Pacers will have no answer for him yet again. He's averaging 37.5 points per game against them this season and will score somewhere between 30-35 on Wednesday night. Haliburton has only registered 12 assists against the Thunder in this series but before that, he had 10+ in 9 of the team's first 16 playoff games. At +265, that's an incredible value that I can't pass up. McConnell continues to be a spark plug off the bench for Indiana and has registered 14 and 20 PRA in this series despite playing less than 20 minutes per game. I wouldn't be surprised if Gilgeous-Alexander hit a game winner with close to no time left on the clock as Haliburton did in Game 1. After watching the domination in Game 2, I'm confident that Oklahoma City wins this series in six games."", ""You've seen Cohen's best bets for Pacers vs. Thunder on Wednesday.

The Thunder's defense is a remarkable blend of relentless pressure, swarming help, elite playmaking and togetherness."", '""Fifteen puppets on one string,"" Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards said, describing Oklahoma City\'s defensive chemistry. -- Tim MacMahon', '', ""It might have been easy to overlook the Pacers at the start of the postseason, but after an exciting run as underdogs through the Eastern Conference field, they won't be so easily dismissed anymore."", ""The Pacers won 50 games and entered the playoffs as a No. 4 seed, but a slow start to the season masked their true contender qualities. It wasn't apparent when they dispatched their new rival, the Milwaukee Bucks, in five games in the first round, but when they made a 64-win Cleveland Cavaliers team look ordinary, the Pacers announced their ascent from young up-and-comer to conference elite."", '""They\'re up here, guys,"" Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said, raising his hand toward his head for emphasis, after his top-seeded team was eliminated from the conference semifinals.', '""I know from the data, I know from watching film, they\'re up here and they can sustain it. I give them so much credit for being able to sustain that type of intensity for so long.""', 'It set up a matchup in the Eastern Conference finals with Indiana\'s greatest rival, the New York Knicks, the same franchise the Pacers beat in their only other trip to the Finals in 2000. Indiana\'s elite offense overwhelmed the Knicks in six games, led by Tyrese Haliburton, who has had a star-making playoff run, averaging 18.8 points, 9.8 assists and 5.7 rebounds in the postseason to go along with a few huge clutch shots; Pascal Siakam, who was named conference finals MVP after putting up three 30-point games in the series; and coach Rick Carlisle, a champion with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 whom Haliburton has termed a ""savant.""', 'The Pacers have posted the second-best offensive efficiency in the playoffs at 117.7 points per 100 possessions. They have a deep bench and play fast for a full 48 minutes, which has allowed them to pull off three of the most improbable comebacks in playoff history during this run. They were down by seven in the last 40 seconds of Game 5 in the first round against the Bucks. They trailed again by seven in the final 50 seconds of Game 2 in the second round against the Cavaliers. And in Game 1 against the Knicks, they were down 14 with 2:51 remaining. Indiana came back to win each game.', '""It\'s how we orchestrated this team,"" said Pacers center Myles Turner, the longest-tenured player on the team. ""It\'s not the flashiest, sexiest team. We just get results."" -- Jamal Collier', '', 'The Thunder -- who went 29-1 against the Eastern Conference, the best interconference record in NBA history -- won both head-to-head meetings this season, but their victory at Indianapolis on Dec. 26 required a fourth-quarter comeback. Down four with 3:42 to play after a 7-0 Pacers run, Oklahoma City ripped off eight consecutive points to take control, with Jalen Williams scoring half of them. Gilgeous-Alexander was still the standout with 45 points on 15-of-22 shooting, including four 3-pointers in five attempts, plus a perfect 11-for-11 night at the foul line.', 'There was little drama when the Thunder hosted Indiana on March 29. Oklahoma City opened up a 22-point lead after three quarters. The Thunder knocked down 17 3-pointers, including six from Dort and five off the bench from Isaiah Joe. -- Kevin Pelton', '', ""The NBA is at the peak of parity, with six different title winners over the past six seasons (and a seventh to be crowned this year), but the Thunder have dynasty potential. This is the second-youngest team (average age: 25.6 years) to advance to the Finals, trailing only the Portland Trail Blazers' 1976-77 championship team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. A deep Thunder roster is built around a 26-year-old MVP in Gilgeous-Alexander, a 24-year-old All-NBA selection in Williams and a 23-year-old potential future Defensive Player of the Year in Holmgren. Plus, general manager Sam Presti has accumulated 13 first-round picks over the next seven drafts. Oklahoma City's last Finals team -- which featured MVPs Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden -- is a case study in future success never being guaranteed in the NBA. But the Thunder enter the Finals as a heavy favorite, and it's easy to envision them becoming June regulars. -- MacMahon"", ""The Thunder's defense will easily be the toughest challenge for the Pacers to solve -- a healthy, swarming juggernaut unit with youth and speed that can match (and perhaps thrive) in Indiana's up-tempo style. The Pacers have benefited from seemingly catching each of their playoff opponents by surprise with their speed, putting opposing teams on their heels and forcing them into uncharacteristic styles and mistakes. Indiana will enter the series with more experience, and Carlisle will continue to try to find a way to dictate the terms of the series as he has in each of the previous three rounds. But the gap between the top of the West and the East has seemed wide for most of the season, which is why Oklahoma City enters the series as a heavy favorite. The Pacers have thrived in their underdog role all postseason. Can they find a way to pull off one more massive upset? -- Collier"", '', 'Tyrese Haliburton vs. Luguentz Dort', ""The All-NBA guard against the first-team All-Defense stopper. Haliburton is the engine who makes the Pacers go, but he hasn't worked that way against Dort. Over the past two seasons, Haliburton averaged just 12 points per game against the Thunder, his fewest against any opponent, and he attempted shots at a lower rate when guarded by Dort than any other defender, according to GeniusIQ tracking."", ""If the Thunder can slow Haliburton like they have in the regular season, and thereby gum up the works of Indiana's offense, this series won't last very long. If Haliburton can solve Dort's physical defense and keep the Pacers humming, however, Indiana has a chance to shock the world and upset the title favorites. -- Zach Kram"", '', ""By doing what they've been doing throughout the regular season and playoffs. A Finals win would complete a historic season for Oklahoma City, which posted the best point differential ever in the regular season (plus-12.9 PPG) and has the best for any team heading into the Finals (plus-10.8) since both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors in 2017."", 'More specifically, the Thunder will win this series as long as they continue controlling the turnover differential, which has proved to be a key stat throughout the playoffs. Oklahoma City is simultaneously forcing far more turnovers than any other team (18.0 per game) while averaging fewer on offense than any team that advanced past the first round (11.6). That margin (6.4 per game) would be the highest for a team that played multiple series since the league began tracking team turnovers in 1973-74. -- Pelton', ""Indiana's path to the Larry O'Brien Trophy involves three steps."", ""First, the Pacers can't lose the turnover battle by as drastic a margin as every other Thunder opponent. There are encouraging signs here: Haliburton ranks as one of the lowest-turnover guards in the league, and Indiana ranked third in both the regular season and postseason in lowest turnover rate. Taking care of the ball will limit Oklahoma City's demoralizing, game-breaking transition sequences."", ""Second, the Pacers need to win the 3-point battle by a wide margin. Again, there's reason for hope here, as Indiana leads all playoff teams with a 40.1% 3-point mark, while Oklahoma City's shooters have collectively struggled (33.6% this postseason)."", ""And finally, the Pacers have to win close games. The Thunder are sufficiently dominant that they should expect a blowout win or two in the Finals; they've won at least one game by 30-plus points in every series so far. But if Indiana can win the non-blowouts, an upset is possible. The Pacers are 7-1 in clutch games in the playoffs. -- Kram"", '', 'Best bet for the Thunder: Thunder 4-2 exact series result (+400)', ""The Thunder's elite defense, net rating (+11.2) and superstar in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander give them the edge. It's difficult to see the Pacers offense having the same success against an Oklahoma City team that forced nearly 18 turnovers per 100 possessions. The Thunder have a deep rotation, play with discipline and are eager to etch their names into NBA history. -- Eric Moody"", 'Best bet for the Pacers: Pacers +2.5 over Thunder (+110)', 'The Thunder enter the Finals as clear favorites, for good reason, but the Pacers are still better than many credit them for. Since Jan. 1, including playoffs, the Thunder have the best record in the NBA (53-13)... but the Pacers have the second-best (46-18), ahead of the third-place Boston Celtics (43-17) and fourth-place Cleveland Cavaliers (40-18). If either the Celtics or Cavaliers had made the Finals, with the type of regular season they had, this would have been expected to be a close series. But because the Pacers had a slower start to the season, the expectation is the Finals will be a blowout. The Pacers were clearly the class of the East in calendar year 2025, and are more likely to make this a competitive series than the oddsmakers have caught up to. -- Andre Snellings', 'More bets for the 2025 NBA Finals', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXlhbW95Y21nNFZTMVJRMTluVFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhaGxJcUx0UVk=-w280-h168-p-df
