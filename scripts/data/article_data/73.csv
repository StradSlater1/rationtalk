The data shows that outbreaks are persisting, with 109 confirmed cases in April and 86 in May as far as current figures for last month show.', 'The majority of these cases have been among unvaccinated children aged 10 and under, with several regions experiencing ongoing outbreaks. London alone accounted for nearly half of all reported cases in the past month.', 'The agency also noted a worldwide increase in measles cases over the past year, including Europe. With summer travel plans on the horizon, there is concern that this could trigger another wave of measles cases in England.', ""Thursday's update on the UKHSA Data Dashboard includes the latest measles epidemiology report:"", 'Since the measles vaccine was introduced in 1968, it has prevented at least 20 million cases and 4,500 deaths in the UK, the UKHSA said.', 'Despite this, measles remains prevalent in many countries globally. Declining MMR vaccine uptake over the past decade, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to significant measles outbreaks in Europe and elsewhere.', ""A study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported 127,350 measles cases in the European Region for 2024. This figure is double the number of cases reported for 2023 and represents the highest number since 1997."", 'This year, measles outbreaks have spread across various European nations including France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. The World Health Organization recently highlighted infections in countries such as Romania, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and Nigeria as among the highest globally.', ""In England, there has been a drop in childhood immunisations like MMR over the past ten years, with rates now languishing below the WHO's recommended 95% goal. As a result, thousands of children remain vulnerable to the disease, which increases the likelihood of outbreaks centred around nurseries and schools."", 'London is trailing behind other areas in England for MMR vaccination rates; at just 73.3% uptake at age five, it falls significantly short of the English average of 83.9%.', 'Between Autumn 2023 and summer 2024, England was hit by its largest measles outbreak since 2012, predominantly affecting younger children. While the numbers have gone down from their peak last year, intermittent local flare-ups are still occurring.', 'The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that measles is ""one of the most highly infectious diseases and spreads rapidly among those who are unvaccinated"". They\'re anxious about the potential for bigger outbreaks this summer, particularly as families with unvaccinated members may travel to affected regions.', 'Furthermore, the UKHSA advised: ""It is important that anyone travelling for summer holidays or to visit family, especially parents of young children, check that all members of their family have received both their MMR vaccines.', '""Getting vaccinated means you are also helping protect others who can\'t have the vaccine, including infants under one year and people with weakened immune systems, who are at greater risk of serious illness and complications from measles.""', 'Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""It\'s essential that everyone, particularly parents of young children, check all family members are up to date with two MMR doses, especially if you are travelling this summer for holidays or visiting family. Measles cases are picking up again in England and outbreaks are happening in Europe and many countries with close links to the UK.', '""Measles spreads very easily and can be a nasty disease, leading to complications like ear and chest infections and inflammation of the brain with some children tragically ending up in hospital and suffering life-long consequences. Nobody wants this for their child and it\'s not something you want to experience when away on holiday.', '""The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and your family from measles. Babies under the age of 1 and some people who have weakened immune systems can\'t have the vaccine and are at risk of more serious complications if they get measles. They rely on the rest of us getting the vaccine to protect them.', '""It is never too late to catch up, if you\'re not sure if any of your family are up to date, check their Red Book or contact your GP practice. Don\'t put it off and regret it later.""', 'Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS England\'s national director for primary care and community services added: ""Tens of thousands of additional MMR vaccinations were delivered following NHS action last year to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella, and the recent increase in cases seen in England and Europe should act as an important reminder to ensure your child is protected.', '""Too many babies and young children are still not protected against the diseases, which are contagious infections that spread very easily and can cause serious health problems. MMR jabs are provided free as part of the NHS routine immunisation programme – and I would encourage all parents to act on invites or check vaccination records if they think they may have missed their child\'s vaccination.""', 'Infants are typically offered the first MMR jab when they turn one year old and a second booster dose around three years and four months during preschool.', 'It was noted that approximately 99% of people receiving two doses will be covered against measles and rubella, with slightly less protection against mumps, though even those vaccinated tend to experience milder symptoms should they contract it.', ""Whether you're a toddler or a senior, it’s never past the point of seeking protection: anyone who hasn't had their full course of two MMR shots can reach out to their GP surgery to arrange a vaccination - it's always a worthy endeavour to immunise and fortify yourself regardless of age."", ""It's particularly important to check you've had both doses if you are:"", 'For more information on measles, mumps and rubella see the UKHSA resource: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mmr-for-all-general-leaflet', '', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNWxSblZXYVZSQllXUmpMWEJDVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdPSkpnUQ=-w280-h168-p-df

"Measles Outbreaks Rise in France, Italy, Spain, and Germany: What Travelers Need to Know Ahead of Summer Holidays",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/measles-outbreaks-rise-in-france-italy-spain-and-germany-what-travelers-need-to-know-ahead-of-summer-holidays/,"['', '', 'Friday, June 6, 2025', 'As summer holidays approach, travelers are being warned about the potential spread of measles across Europe. Measles, a highly infectious disease, has seen a significant rise in cases over the past year, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reporting that cases in Europe have reached their highest level in nearly three decades. The increasing number of measles outbreaks has become a growing concern for public health authorities as families begin making plans for their summer vacations. The rise in cases across Europe is particularly concerning, as many travelers may unknowingly bring the disease back to the UK after holidaying abroad.', 'With 127,000 confirmed cases in Europe last year, the UKHSA raised alarms over the declining rates of childhood vaccinations, including the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which protects against measles. This has led to a greater number of children and adults being vulnerable to the disease. The health agency also pointed out that the decline in vaccination rates could lead to more people contracting measles, especially when they travel to areas with known outbreaks.', 'Advertisement', 'As the summer travel season draws closer, health experts and authorities are urging travelers to take precautions and ensure that they are vaccinated, particularly those traveling to countries where measles outbreaks have already been reported. This article examines the impact of the current measles situation on global travel, how it may affect travelers, and the tourism industry’s role in managing the public health risk.', 'The UKHSA highlighted that, in Europe, measles outbreaks have been documented in countries like France, Italy, Spain, and Germany. These countries are experiencing a resurgence of the disease, posing a threat to the health of both local populations and travelers. With the rise in cases, travelers heading to Europe for the summer season need to be especially cautious. As one of the most contagious diseases globally, measles spreads easily through close contact, especially in densely populated areas such as airports, train stations, and tourist attractions.', 'For travelers from the UK, the situation is of particular concern due to the potential for infected individuals to return from their holidays and inadvertently spread the disease across communities. Health experts have warned that unvaccinated individuals, particularly young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk of severe complications from measles.', 'As the disease spreads, the travel industry could face increased pressure. Travel agencies, airlines, and tourism operators may see shifts in traveler behavior, as concerns about health risks could influence decisions to travel to certain destinations. Furthermore, countries with high measles case numbers may experience disruptions in their tourism industries as travelers seek alternative destinations or delay their plans due to health concerns.', 'The spread of measles is not confined to Europe alone. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that countries such as Romania, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and Nigeria have some of the highest numbers of measles cases worldwide. Travelers heading to these regions, especially those planning to visit family or explore cultural destinations, are particularly vulnerable. Health experts are concerned that with unvaccinated children and adults traveling to areas with active measles outbreaks, the risk of further spreading the disease increases.', 'In Romania, which has been grappling with a significant measles outbreak, the situation has worsened over recent years due to insufficient vaccination coverage. As tourism from countries like the UK and the US continues to increase, especially in the summer months, the global travel industry must acknowledge how health issues such as measles can affect travel patterns, tourism flows, and public perception of certain destinations. Travelers who may have planned to visit Eastern Europe for cultural and historical exploration may be deterred by news of rising health risks.', 'In countries like Thailand and Indonesia, where measles outbreaks have been reported, tourism authorities are faced with the challenge of ensuring that foreign travelers are aware of the health risks before they travel. With tourism being a vital economic contributor to many of these countries, the need for health screening and vaccination awareness is paramount to ensure the safety of both local residents and international visitors.', 'One of the key factors contributing to the rise in measles cases is the decline in childhood vaccination rates. Over the past decade, vaccination rates in the UK and other countries have steadily decreased, particularly for the MMR vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency attributes this decline to various factors, including misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, and concerns over the perceived risks associated with vaccinations.', 'As more children and adults remain unvaccinated, the risk of measles outbreaks grows significantly. Health authorities have warned that without proper vaccination coverage, diseases like measles, which were previously controlled, could once again become widespread. This creates a ripple effect, particularly for the travel industry, as tourism-dependent economies may see slower growth due to the health risks posed to visitors.', 'The global travel industry will need to adapt to these health concerns by providing information to travelers about the importance of vaccination before embarking on international trips. As the demand for international travel continues to rise, especially in regions that have experienced measles outbreaks, the travel industry will be forced to balance the desire for safe travel experiences with the reality of health risks.', 'With rising measles cases across Europe and other regions, the tourism industry faces a pivotal moment in addressing global health challenges. Travel operators, tour guides, and national tourism boards must take a proactive role in educating travelers about the risks associated with measles and the importance of being vaccinated before traveling.', 'Travel agencies and airlines can use their platforms to distribute information about MMR vaccination, providing advice to families and travelers planning their vacations. Furthermore, the public health sector and tourism boards must work together to ensure that travelers understand the importance of preventative measures when traveling to high-risk areas. By proactively addressing these issues, the travel industry can mitigate the risk of measles outbreaks and reassure travelers about their safety while exploring new destinations.', 'As part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, tourism companies can partner with health organizations to raise awareness about vaccination and public health practices. This could include providing resources to travelers on how to check their vaccination status and where to get vaccines before traveling, especially to countries with known outbreaks.', 'For travelers, especially those with young children or health concerns, the rise in measles cases across Europe and other regions may prompt them to rethink their travel plans. Many travelers may choose to postpone or change their destinations due to health risks. As the tourism industry adapts to the increasing awareness of global health concerns, it may need to rethink how it promotes high-risk destinations or offers alternative travel experiences that prioritize safety.', 'In response, tourism boards and government health agencies in affected regions could implement health checks at entry points, providing travelers with the necessary information to make informed decisions about whether or not they should visit certain areas. Moreover, travel insurance policies could adapt to cover potential cancellations or medical expenses related to health risks like measles, ensuring that travelers feel secure in case of unforeseen events.', 'The ongoing concerns about measles outbreaks across Europe and other regions signal broader trends in the global travel landscape. As health issues like measles continue to surface, vaccination will become a central consideration for travelers planning international trips. The travel industry will need to collaborate closely with health authorities to ensure that public health and safety are prioritized, especially for travelers heading to destinations where outbreaks have been reported.', 'With measles being highly infectious and travelers being potential carriers of the disease, global mobility may become increasingly influenced by health considerations. As health protocols are introduced across borders, travel companies may be required to enforce vaccination checks before departure. This could lead to more stringent entry requirements for travelers visiting countries with known outbreaks, impacting travel itineraries and business plans.', 'As measles cases rise globally, especially in Europe, travelers and the travel industry must adapt to new health risks. The importance of ensuring that travelers are up to date on their vaccinations will become more prominent, and the tourism industry must evolve to address these concerns. Travel companies, from airlines to tour operators, will play a key role in communicating health information and ensuring safe travel experiences for their customers. While the rise of measles cases presents significant challenges, it also offers the opportunity for the travel industry to strengthen its commitment to health and safety, ensuring that future generations of travelers can explore the world without risking their health.', 'Advertisement', 'Tags: Europe, france, germany, global travel, Italy, Measles, public health, spain, Tourism industry, travel disruptions, Travel Health, Travel Safety, vaccination, vaccines', '', '', ""I want to receive travel news and trade event update from Travel And Tour World.

It comes amid a surge in cases throughout Europe.', 'The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has urged parents to ensure their youngsters are vaccinated against measles as part of an update. In its most recent monthly report on measles, the UKHSA said that outbreaks are continuing throughout England, with 109 cases confirmed in April and 86 so far in May. Unvaccinated children aged 10 years and under have been the worst hit.', 'On top of this there has also been a global increase in measles cases including Europe over the last year. The UKHSA said it is “concerned” that the approaching summer holidays could therefore lead to another surge of measles cases in England.', 'Measles cases in Europe doubled in 2024 compared to the year before, with 127,350 reported cases. This is also the highest number since 1997.', 'Outbreaks have been recorded in several European countries, including France, Italy, Spain and Germany. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also reported that Romania, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Nigeria currently have among the largest number of measles cases worldwide.', 'We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and third parties based on our knowledge of you. More info', 'The UKHSA explained that the rise in cases in England is linked to a reduction in the uptake of vaccinations. In its update, it said: “In England, the decline of the uptake of childhood vaccinations including MMR in the past decade (well below the WHO 95 per cent target) means that many thousands of children are left unprotected with the risk of outbreaks linked to nurseries and schools.”', 'London has the lowest MMR uptake rates compared with other English regions, with the uptake over five years at 73.3 per cent compared to English average of 83.9 per cent. The UKHSA continued: “The UKHSA is concerned that more outbreaks may occur again on a larger scale this summer as families with unvaccinated children and adults travel to countries where there are outbreaks.', '“It is important that anyone travelling for summer holidays or to visit family, especially parents of young children, check that all members of their family have received both their MMR vaccines.', '“Getting vaccinated means you are also helping protect others who can’t have the vaccine, including infants under one year and people with weakened immune systems, who are at greater risk of serious illness and complications from measles.”', 'Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “It’s essential that everyone, particularly parents of young children, check all family members are up to date with two MMR doses, especially if you are travelling this summer for holidays or visiting family. Measles cases are picking up again in England and outbreaks are happening in Europe and many countries with close links to the UK.', '“Measles spreads very easily and can be a nasty disease, leading to complications like ear and chest infections and inflammation of the brain with some children tragically ending up in hospital and suffering life-long consequences. Nobody wants this for their child and it’s not something you want to experience when away on holiday.”', 'She added that the MMR vaccine is the “best way” to protect yourself and your family from measles. The MMR vaccine is offered to all children in the UK.', ""Two doses can give lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. The NHS says you should ask at your GP surgery if you're not sure you or your child have had the vaccine. They can give it for free on the NHS."", 'Key symptoms of measles include a high fever, coughing, sneezing, red and sore watery eyes, and a rash that usually appears after the initial symptoms.', 'Measles can lead to potentially fatal complications if not caught quickly including pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures (fits). You should ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you think you or your child has measles.', '']",Health,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iJ0NnNWxSblZXYVZSQllXUmpMWEJDVFJDZkF4ampCU2dLTWdPSkpnUQ=-w280-h168-p-df
