This helps calculate the distance of space available whenever he needs to chase down a deep drive. Still, he does not truly get a sense for what he’s working with until he gets his first ball hit his way.', '“I always say the first play in my first time playing a new ballpark is going to break the ice,” Clarke said. “Crazy play to break the ice.”', 'That icebreaker came in the form of a Statcast-projected 398-foot drive hit by Nolan Schanuel in the first inning of Monday night’s 7-4 loss to the Angels. Clarke, the Athletics’ No. 6 prospect, per MLB Pipeline, climbed the wall in left-center field at Angel Stadium and delivered yet another catch for the ages as he robbed Schanuel of a solo home run.', '“I just timed it up,” Clarke said. “Found my distance between the wall and just did what the ball told me to do. Just go up there and get it.”', 'It was reminiscent of Clarke’s phenomenal home run robbery a couple of weeks ago, when he returned to his hometown of Toronto for the first time as a big leaguer and scaled the center-field wall at Rogers Centre to take one away from Alejandro Kirk with a leaping grab.', 'This one might have been better as Spider-Man struck again. Clarke got an excellent read on the ball off the bat and tracked it all the way to the warning track. He then perfectly timed a leap just a couple of feet before the wall and grabbed the top of the wall with his right hand for support while the upper half of his body extended completely over the fence.', '“That play was pretty phenomenal,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. “I asked our bench coach Darren Bush, ‘If he had fallen over the fence, how would they have ruled that?’ That’s about as far over a fence you can get without going over and making a play. We talk about his range. The package is instinct, reaction and speed. He’s got it all.”', 'The expressions on the field said it all. A’s pitcher Grant Holman stood on the mound with both hands over his head. Schanuel, who was halfway to second base, gazed out to the outfield with a look of disbelief. Even Clarke, who has remained somewhat stoic following his previous outstanding catches, couldn’t help but let out a huge roar as he jumped off the wall and back onto the field.', 'Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.', '“I’ve played with Denzel for a few years now, dating back to the Minor Leagues,” Holman said. “I’ve seen him do stuff out there that you just don’t see.

But I was stunned. … The guy makes plays every day that continue to blow our minds.”', 'Schanuel admittedly thought he had his fourth home run of the season.', ""“Off the bat, I felt like I got it,” Schanuel said. “Then I see him come back, go down the wall, see the ball disappear, and then come back up and him celebrating with the ball in his glove. My heart dropped. He's a crazy athlete. … He's special. Really good fielder, and he's got a bright future.”"", 'Clarke is less than three weeks into his Major League career, but he might already have wrapped up the top three catches of any player during the 2025 season.

Yankees legendary pitcher David Cone even got into the action.', '“The problem is, is that there’s a purity to this game. The rules of purity state that, if you merit a promotion, it’s supposed to be a meritocracy,” Cone said. “If you are held back and you deserve it and you’re doing everything that you’re supposed to be doing like Roman Anthony is, it just negates that purity. I don’t know if I’m saying it right.', '“But it sends a bad message to the whole organization, it sends a bad message to the whole fan base. Anyone who cares about the Red Sox knows this kid has earned his way to the big leagues and he’s being held back, and he deserves to be here. There’s something that just doesn’t pass the smell test there.', '“You find a way. You’re supposed to get your best players on the field. You’re not supposed to retain roster spots because of contracts, or because there’s not a proper fit, or because you think he needs to work on something else that he clearly doesn’t. He’s earned it. You have to send that message to the whole organization and to everybody in the fan base that he deserves it. ‘We’re going to move him up. He broke the door down.’ When that’s not happening, there’s something not right in the universe. It’s a bad message all the way up and down.”', 'The premise of Cone’s argument is correct, even if history suggests that teams do this all the time with prospects. Many organizations will delay a prospect’s promotion, instead pointing to an area of improvement to unlock before reaching the majors. The reality is that no player is perfect, opponents adapt and every player fine-tunes their craft.', 'Red Sox manager Alex Cora told reporters it was “fair” to say that the organization is having conversations about calling up Anthony, though “he’s not the final product.”', 'The Red Sox’s 32-35 season has been a disappointment, and it’s been littered with roster pockmarks. To name a few, their best hitter, Rafael Devers, moved from third base to designated hitter when Alex Bregman was signed and then declined to go to first base when Tristan Casas suffered a season-ending injury; rookie Kristian Campbell, a second baseman, has struggled (93 OPS+) after a hot start and was working out at first base, a new position; and Ceddanne Rafaela, their best center field defender, can’t hit (91 OPS+).', 'ESPN MLB reporter Buster Olney and Cone agreed that if Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow were given truth serum, he would acknowledge that Anthony is one of the Red Sox’s best players.', 'At some point, he’ll have to act on that.', 'Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

When he crushed a 450-foot homer during the High School All-American Game at Coors Field in July 2021, he also was known for an overly aggressive approach and a long left-handed swing.

He does a nice job of using the entire field and has the potential to hit .300 with 30 homers per year in the Majors -- and more if he learns to launch balls in the air to his pull side more consistently.

Anthony did notch a hard-hit ball -- a 111.2 mph liner off of Shane Baz that was converted into an out. He also recorded his first career RBI with a ninth-inning ground-out.

Rafael Devers is entrenched as the designated hitter, and both Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu have done their parts in the corners. That leaves center field as the realistic pathway, but even then, Boston may reason that Ceddanne Rafaela's elite defense is worth tolerating his bat. I do think that, at some indeterminable point, the Red Sox will have to make a more efficient use of their personnel by putting Anthony or Abreu at the cold corner. If and/or when they reach that conclusion is anyone's guess, yet I'm including Anthony anyway because he's a violent sneeze away from The Show."", ""Abreu, 25, hit .245/.321/.471 (118 OPS+) with 13 home runs and four stolen bases in 64 games before his injury.

Red Sox Promote Roman Anthony,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/06/red-sox-to-promote-roman-anthony.html,"['MLB Trade Rumors', 'By Darragh McDonald | June 9, 2025 at 11:58pm CDT', 'It’s finally Roman Anthony time. The Red Sox announced that the top prospect in baseball has been selected to the roster. Fellow outfielder Wilyer Abreu has been placed on the 15-day injured list with a left oblique strain. First baseman/outfielder Ryan Noda has been designated for assignment to open a 40-man spot.', '', 'Anthony, now 21, has been at or near the top of prospect lists for a while now. The Sox grabbed him with the 79th overall pick in 2022, a compensation pick they received after Eduardo Rodríguez rejected a qualifying offer and signed with the Tigers.', 'After a brief professional debut in that 2022 season, he took off in 2023. He climbed from Single-A to High-A to Double-A, putting up a combined .272/.403/.466 line and 140 wRC+. That made him a consensus top 25 prospect in the sport coming into 2024. He raised his stock even higher last year, slashing .291/.396/.498 for a 147 wRC+ between Double-A and Triple-A.', 'In addition to that work at the plate, Anthony tallied double-digit stolen base totals in both 2023 and 2024. He is also considered a strong outfield defender. By the end of 2024, he was already the #1 prospect in the league for some outlets. Some publications bumped him to #2 once Roki Sasaki was signed by the Dodgers, though others kept Anthony in the top spot.', 'Between Anthony, Kristian Campbell, Marcelo Mayer, and Kyle Teel, the Sox had four tremendous prospects generating excitement this past offseason. The four were often mentioned in trade rumors and Teel was eventually flipped to the White Sox as part of the Garrett Crochet deal, though the other three remained and still provided a lot of optimism about the future.', 'Coming into 2025, with that hype and already having 35 big league games under his belt, a quick promotion for Anthony seemed possible. However, his time in Triple-A has dragged on, despite murmuring from all corners of the baseball world.', 'Initially, some of that was justified. He was dealing with some shoulder soreness in April and spent some time where he was only serving as the designated hitter and not playing the field. But that quickly passed and he kept putting up huge numbers at the plate. The question then became one of playing time in Boston. The Sox have spent most of this year with a crowded outfield mix consisting of Abreu, Jarren Duran and Ceddanne Rafaela, with Rob Refsnyder and Campbell also factoring in.', 'That didn’t leave a clean path for Anthony to get playing time, especially with Rafael Devers taking up the designated hitter spot on an everyday basis. Still, many were calling for the Sox to simply call him up and figure it out.', 'Those calls grew louder when the Sox lost both of their corner infielders. First, Triston Casas suffered a season-ending knee injury. That led to much speculation about Devers getting plugged in at first in order to open at-bats for Anthony, or perhaps Anthony taking first base himself. Understandably, the Sox didn’t want to mess with Anthony’s development as an outfielder, so they never gave much consideration to that. Devers was unwilling to try his hand at first base. Then third baseman Alex Bregman went on the IL with a quad injury that could keep him out for a couple of months, but the Sox never seemed to really consider the possibility of asking Devers about going back there.', 'As all that was going on, Anthony continued to put up massive numbers for Worcester. As of today, he has a .288/.423/.491 line and 146 wRC+. He has ten home runs and three steals in 58 games. His 19.2% walk rate is almost as high as his 21.1% strikeout rate. Now, finally, it seems like this Abreu injury will open the door for him to get to the big leagues.', 'As the season drags along, the playing time puzzle might return. That will depend on Abreu’s injury and how long it will take him to get back. At some point, maybe Masataka Yoshida will finally get healthy and re-enter the equation.', 'It’s possible things will work out organically. Other injuries may arise before those guys heal up. Anthony might struggle, as even the best prospects can sometimes need a bit of time to get their feet wet in the big leagues. Campbell also followed a hot April with a rough May. If he doesn’t get back on track, perhaps he could get optioned to the minors with Rafaela moving to the infield. But on the other hand, Rafaela is the best defensive center fielder of the bunch. Duran and Anthony can play up the middle but each is considered a better fit for a corner. There’s also the shortstop question, as Trevor Story has been heating up of late but is having a bad season overall. Mayer is up to cover for Bregman at third but hasn’t quite fully clicked in the big leagues yet.', 'There will also be long-term things to be sorted out. The crowded outfield situation has led to trade rumors surrounding Duran. Bregman could opt out after this season and it’s unclear if the Sox would be willing to return Devers to that spot. Casas is expected back by next year’s spring training but he has also been in trade rumors. Devers isn’t willing to play there now but perhaps he would be more amenable with an offseason to prepare. Campbell has dabbled with some first base drills but hasn’t officially played there yet.', '', 'In time, there should be more clarity on the club’s long-term plans. For now, Sox fans can get excited about Anthony’s emergence and hope that it helps turn around a middling season. The Sox are currently 32-35, fourth in the American League East and four games back of a Wild Card spot. Even if they can’t engineer a comeback this year, players like Anthony, Mayer, Campbell, Rafael, Duran, Abreu and others can be affordably controlled for years to come, giving the club an exciting core to build around.', 'As a consensus top prospect, Anthony is eligible for the prospect promotion incentive. Since the Sox didn’t promote him early enough to get a full service year the traditional way, they won’t be able to earn an extra draft pick based on awards voting this year. Anthony can technically earn himself a full year of service time by finishing in the top two of Rookie of the Year voting, though that will be tough to do. Players like Jacob Wilson, Shane Smith and even Anthony’s teammate Carlos Narváez have a big headstart on him. Even if he performs well, it would be hard to catch up to those guys with more than a third of the season already in the books.', 'If Anthony manages to pull that off, he would hasten his path to free agency by a year. Otherwise, he would be on pace to hit the open market after 2031 at the earliest, though future optional assignments could also impact that timeline.', 'Noda, 29, was just acquired from the Angels a few weeks ago in a cash deal. He’s a three true outcomes guy, with lots of homers and walks but also strikeouts. In 606 big league plate appearances, he has a 34.2% strikeout rate, 15% walk rate and 17 homers. That adds up to a .212/.344/.369 line and 107 wRC+. Dating back to the start of 2022, he has 574 minor league plate appearances with 25 home runs, a 16% walk rate and 28.2% strikeout rate. That leads to a .259/.395/.474 line and 125 wRC+.', 'The Sox grabbed him for extra first base depth with the Casas injury but now risk losing him. DFA limbo can last as long as a week but the waiver process takes 48 hours, so Boston could take five days to explore trade interest. He is still optionable for the rest of this year and one additional season. If he were to pass through waivers unclaimed, he would stick with the Sox as non-roster depth.', 'Christopher Smith of MassLive first reported that Anthony was being promoted. A few minutes earlier, Chris Cotillo of MassLive reported that a promotion was possible. Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic first noted that Abreu was going on the IL, though Alex Speier of The Boston Globe had previously suggested that an IL stint for Abreu was likely.', 'Photos courtesy of Ashley Green, Imagn Images', 'BOSTON RED SOX NEWSSTAND TOP PROSPECT PROMOTIONS TRANSACTIONS\nROMAN ANTHONY RYAN NODA WILYER ABREU', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ' ', 'MLB Trade Rumors is not affiliated with Major League Baseball, MLB or MLB.com', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNXZjME5CZWpodGNUSlNRWHAwVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZWlFwckxuUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

In fact, he made half of his starts at shortstop during his rookie season last year. It seems that the clearest path for Anthony at this point would be for Rafaela to start at second base.', 'In that scenario, Duran could move to center -- a position he was a Gold Glove finalist at last season -- and Anthony could play left. Against lefties, Rafaela could still see some time in center.', 'Kristian Campbell, the primary starter for the Sox at second base this season, has struggled mightily of late and it’s possible he could go back to Triple-A for more seasoning.', 'The buzz surrounding Boston’s drafted and developed “Big 3” of Anthony, Marcelo Mayer and Campbell never seems to stop.', 'Mayer was called up for his Major League debut last month following an injury to Alex Bregman and he’s been starting at third base against righties.', 'The latest tape-measure homer by Anthony was one of a batch of them he’s hit this season. At some point soon, the 31-35 Sox would seemingly benefit from some of that jaw-dropping power.', '""I still believe he\'s not the final product, just like Marcelo and Campbell and Ceddanne and Wily,” said Cora. “There\'s things that players need to do better, and they will. Right now, we saw [Campbell] here the first month of the season, and we were like, ‘Wow, this is great.’ And now it’s like, ‘Wow, we have to help him out, right?\' So understanding that it\'s not an easy process and not as easy of a transition like people think it is.

But it was amazing. You dream of that every single day. So, to finally hear it was definitely awesome.”', 'Anthony, who played right field and batted fifth, received the biggest cheer of all during pregame introductions and then a standing ovation from the crowd of 31,422 when he came to bat in the second inning, with a runner on first and nobody out. He popped up to left field and got another cheer as he returned to the dugout.', 'In the third, he may have been robbed of his first major league hit when he lined a ball up the middle that hit pitcher Shane Baz — at 111 mph. It deflected to the third baseman, who made the throw to first for the out.

But while fellow prospects Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer got the call, the Red Sox remained patient on Anthony until an injury to Wilyer Abreu left them needing another outfielder.', '“It’s been a long time coming,” said Mayer, who was called up about two weeks ago. “It’s been talked about for a very long time, and it’s kind of crazy that today’s the day that we’re all going to share the field together in the big leagues. I’m super excited. I think we have a really good team, and he’s just another great addition to that.”', 'Cora said he noticed something was wrong with Abreu after Sunday’s game against the Yankees. When the team realized it would be more than a day or two, they decided to make the move and put Abreu on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain.

Anthony was in the starting lineup against the Tampa Bay Rays, batting fifth and manning right field. Wilyer Abreu landed on the injured list with an oblique strain.', ""In Boston's eventual 10-8 loss in extras, Anthony went 0 for 4 with a walk and a strikeout before being lifted for pinch-hitter Rob Refsnyder in the bottom of the 11th. Anthony did notch a hard-hit ball -- a 111.2 mph liner off of Shane Baz that was converted into an out. He also recorded his first career RBI with a ninth-inning ground-out. In all, he left four runners on base. "", 'In the field, Anthony made what turned out to be a critical miscue in the field with this fifth-inning error: ', ""Anthony, 21, entered the spring ranked by CBS Sports as the No. 1 prospect in the minors. He's done nothing to change that status. In his first 58 Triple-A games this year, he hit .288/.423/.491 with 10 home runs, three stolen bases, and nearly as many walks as strikeouts (51 versus 56)."", ""We recently covered Anthony's season to date and attempted to divine what, precisely, would have to change for him to receive the call:"", 'Anthony, my preseason No. 1, continues to bully Triple-A pitchers. Coming into Wednesday, he has hit .321/.453/.518 with seven home runs, 10 additional extra-base hits, and nearly as many walks as strikeouts -- all that despite being extremely young (by more than five years) for Triple-A. His average exit velocity against right-handed pitching so far, and I want to stress that I do mean average, is over 97 mph. ', ""Why isn't Anthony up? The Red Sox continue to resist the urge to play Anthony at first base, leaving him without a clean entry point to the big-league roster. Rafael Devers is entrenched as the designated hitter, and both Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu have done their parts in the corners. That leaves center field as the realistic pathway, but even then, Boston may reason that Ceddanne Rafaela's elite defense is worth tolerating his bat. I do think that, at some indeterminable point, the Red Sox will have to make a more efficient use of their personnel by putting Anthony or Abreu at the cold corner. If and/or when they reach that conclusion is anyone's guess, yet I'm including Anthony anyway because he's a violent sneeze away from The Show."", ""Abreu, 25, hit .245/.321/.471 (118 OPS+) with 13 home runs and four stolen bases in 64 games before his injury. His contributions had been worth 1.7 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. The Red Sox offered no timetable on Abreu, but it's worth noting that Baseball Prospectus' database suggests oblique strains tend to cost players five weeks on average. That doesn't mean Abreu will be sidelined for that long, of course, as every injury is unique in their own way."", 'With the loss to the Rays, the fourth-place Red Sox dropped to 32-36 on the season.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Rosenthal: Red Sox can’t waste any more time in calling up top prospect Roman Anthony,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6411434/2025/06/08/red-sox-roman-anthony-kristian-campbell/,"['MLB', '200', 'NEW YORK — If the play wasn’t the last straw, it should be.', 'Boston Red Sox rookie second baseman Kristian Campbell needs more defensive reps at Triple A. Top prospect Roman Anthony needs to be hitting his 497-foot grand slams in the big leagues. Exchanging one for the other would make the Sox a better team.', '', 'Campbell inexplicably broke left on a groundball headed to his right in the fourth inning Saturday night, and an 8-3 Boston lead over the New York Yankees soon became 8-5. No matter that Campbell had two opposite-field RBI singles in the Sox’s 10-7 victory after entering the night batting .129 with a .361 OPS in his last 25 games. His defense at second has been an issue all season.', 'The Sox, which are 31-35, 9 1/2 games out of first place, four games back in the wild card, cannot waste more time. Their best defensive alignment would be Anthony in left, Jarren Duran in center and a combination of Ceddanne Rafaela and David Hamilton at second.', 'True, Rafaela is elite in center, but Duran was a Gold Glove finalist at the position last season before mostly playing left this year. An outfield of Anthony, Duran and Wilyer Abreu in right still would be well above-average. Rafaela and Hamilton would be a significant upgrade at second.', 'If Anthony remains at Triple A one more day, the howling of Red Sox fans on social media and talk radio would be even more justified. And frankly, after Anthony’s 497-foot slam Saturday night with a 115.6-mph exit velocity, the howling should escalate to a deafening level.', '', 'Anthony, 21, is batting .290 with 10 homers and a .916 OPS for Worcester. He is a strong defender at all three outfield positions. The Red Sox, a disjointed mess all season, would instantly become more cohesive if he were the everyday left fielder, allowing the other pieces to fall into place.', 'Pitching is the Red Sox’s most significant issue. But one reason they began the night 20th in the majors in ERA was their shoddy defense. Their defensive efficiency — the rate at which they converted batted balls into outs — was the fifth worst in the league. And Campbell, playing a valuable up-the-middle position, is among the worst second basemen in the league according to both Outs Above Average and Defensive Runs Saved.', '', 'To be sure, Campbell warrants grace. He is three weeks away from his 23rd birthday, less than two years removed from the Red Sox drafting him in the fourth round. The Sox rushed him to the majors, and he was an offensive force in April, winning AL Rookie of the Month. Pitchers then adjusted to him, and the team perhaps contributed to his downward offensive spiral by working him at a new position, first base.', 'The Red Sox not only wanted Campbell at first as a potential replacement for Triston Casas, who suffered a season-ending knee injury on May 2. They also wanted him off second, figuring another rookie, Marcelo Mayer, would offer better defense at the position. Their plan, though, was derailed when Alex Bregman suffered a significant injury to his right quad on May 23. Mayer then was needed to play third, and once Romy González came off the injured list last Sunday, he became an option at first with Abraham Toro.', 'Still with us?', 'Some might argue Rafael Devers’ refusal to play first triggered this entire soap opera, working title, “Out of Position, Out of Contention.” Devers, though, isn’t particularly athletic. The Sox are better with him as the best DH in the American League than they would be with him learning a new position in the middle of a season. And now they have a solution right in front of them, if only they would grab it.', 'This can’t be about Super Two, can it? Delaying Anthony’s promotion could ensure he is eligible for three years of arbitration instead of four. The Super Two cutoff date should be right around this time, if not later.', 'When the Sox opened the season with Campbell, they were in talks with him on an eight-year, $60 million extension, a deal that enabled them to bypass the arbitration process entirely. However, they did not hesitate to promote Mayer on May 24, knowing he could become Super Two eligible. It’s difficult to imagine they are taking a different approach with Anthony. They are not the Pittsburgh Pirates.', '', 'So, what is it then? Anthony’s 94.6-mph average exit velocity is the highest in the minors (minimum 100 results). He might need time to adjust to playing left field in front of the Green Monster. But he wouldn’t be any worse in left than Campbell is at second.', 'As good as Rafaela is in center — he entered Saturday night second in Outs Above Average at the position and first in Defensive Runs Saved among all players — Duran would not be that much of a downgrade. And the Rafaela-Hamilton combination at second alone would make the up-the-middle defense tighter.', 'This isn’t complicated. Campbell for Anthony. Improve the offense, improve the defense. The Red Sox’s talent is better than their record shows. But they need to start putting that talent in the right places, once and for all.', '(Top photo of Roman Anthony: Nick Cammett / Diamond Images via Getty Images)', ""Ken Rosenthal is the senior baseball writer for The Athletic who has spent nearly 35 years covering the major leagues.

Anthony’s home run, which was a grand slam, came in the eighth inning off right-handed reliever Carlos Romero. It’s the longest home run in affiliated baseball in the 2025 season, according to Statcast.', 'As Anthony’s homer traveled 497 feet at the WooSox’ Polar Park, the ball appeared to land over the street behind the right field bleachers. Anthony’s homer had an exit velocity of 115.6 mph and gave the WooSox a 9-4 lead at the time.', '“That ball was crushed,” WooSox manager Chad Tracy told reporters, via MassLive’s Katie Morrison-O’Day. “The dugout erupted the way the ball came off the bat, the trajectory. That was a big time at-bat in a big-time moment again.', '“Roman wants to be up [at the plate] in those moments, and coupled with his elite plate discipline, you know it’s not going to speed up on him and he’s going to swing at the right ones,” Tracy added. “You like his chances that when he’s swinging at the right ones the ball’s gonna find the barrel, and if the ball finds his barrel it has the chance to go a really long way.”', 'Anthony’s home run was his 10th in 57 games this season, which is the most among all WooSox players and tied for 12th among all Triple-A hitters. He’s also hitting .290 with a .916 OPS, adding 29 RBIs over 210 at-bats.', 'Anthony’s strong first two-plus months of the 2025 season have helped solidify him as the consensus top prospect in baseball. It’s also led to many calling for the Red Sox to promote him to the major league squad, especially as Boston’s deals with inconsistencies at the plate since the start of May.', 'The calls for Anthony to be called up only grew louder following his home run on Saturday night. The Athletic‘s Ken Rosenthal joined that chorus.', '“Boston Red Sox rookie second baseman Kristian Campbell needs more defensive reps at Triple A,” Rosenthal wrote. “Top prospect Roman Anthony needs to be hitting his 497-foot grand slams in the big leagues. Exchanging one for the other would make the Sox a better team.”', 'Campbell, who was a part of the Red Sox’ “Big 3” prospects along with Anthony, has also cooled off at the plate so getting off to a good start to his major league career. He’s hit just .150 since he returned from a rib injury in early May, recording one home run, six RBIs, and a .403 OPS in his last 28 games.', 'Of course, the big issue with calling Anthony up is that there currently isn’t an open spot for him in the outfield to play. Jarren Duran has been among the Red Sox’ best hitters over the last couple of seasons and occupies left field. Ceddanne Rafaela is arguably the best defensive center fielder in baseball. Wilyer Abreu has been nearly as strong in right field, winning a Gold Glove last season.', 'However, by sending Campbell down to Triple-A, Rosenthal proposed that the Red Sox move Rafaela to second and Duran to center to make room for Anthony in left.', '“This isn’t complicated. Campbell for Anthony,” Rosenthal wrote. “Improve the offense, improve the defense. The Red Sox’ talent is better than their record shows. But they need to start putting that talent in the right places, once and for all.”', 'Comments in recent weeks from Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow and other members of the organization have suggested that Anthony could be called up soon. That call-up day could be imminent now, though.

Duran remains a key component of their lineup as their leadoff hitter, while Rafaela has been outstanding in his role defensively.', 'According to Jen McCaffrey of The Athletic, the Red Sox will deploy Anthony as a direct replacement for Abreu at right field. However, Duran could go back to center field with Rafaela shifting over to the right if they move the rookie to left field.', '“With Abreu on the IL, Anthony takes over in right for now. Ceddanne Rafaela could play some right field in future games, but has played only one big-league game at the position.

It remains to be seen how long they will keep him in his current defensive role before shifting him to the left side of the outfield.', 'The Red Sox certainly need Anthony to make an instant impact on their lineup to salvage their campaign.

To do that over three or five days, it’s hard. This is about protecting Willy and having a complete roster. It just so happens Roman was the guy. He’s gonna contribute.”', 'Anthony was the obvious move once it became clear Abreu would miss time, according to Cora.', '“We’re trying to win ballgames,” said Cora. “The kid has done an amazing job throughout (player development) getting ready for this moment. Obviously, not the way you want. Willy’s a great player, a great defender, a good at-bat. But he’ll be here. We’re excited.', '“It’s a big day for the organization. It’s not the (best) way of doing it (with Abreu out), but he’s here. We’ll use him the right way and we’ll help him with the adjustments that come with being a big leaguer. I think as far as the person, just being around him in spring training, he’s a mature kid who understands his craft and wants to get better. There’s a few things that we still believe he needs to improve but we’ll help him here and we think he’s gonna be OK.”', 'Anthony, 21, is the consensus No. 1 prospect in baseball. The Florida native has experienced a meteoric rise since the Red Sox gave him a $2.5 million signing bonus as a second-round compensation pick in 2022. In Worcester so far this season, Anthony has hit .288 with 10 homers, 29 RBIs and a .913 OPS in 58 games. Calls for his promotion have gotten loud in recent weeks as he has continued to tear up Triple-A pitching during a period of offensive struggles for the big league club.', 'Anthony is the final member of Boston’s “Big Three” prospect trio to reach the majors and on Monday, he’ll share the field with both Campbell, who has been with the team all season, and Marcelo Mayer, who made his big league debut on May 24. Mayer, who is close friends with Anthony, was in a celebratory mood Monday after learning that the outfielder was en route to Fenway.', '“It has been a long time coming,” Mayer said in the home clubhouse Monday. “It has been talked about for a very long time. It’s kind of crazy today’s the day we’re all going to share the field together in the big leagues. I’m supe excited. I think we have a really good team and he’s just another addition.”', '“I actually heard through the grapevine here, so right when I heard, I shot him a text and called him,” Mayer said. “Just expressed how excited I was for him.”', 'Anthony is the youngest player to reach the majors in a Red Sox uniform since Rafael Devers was called up as a 20-year-old in 2017. At full strength, it’s unclear exactly where Anthony will play on an everyday basis with Jarren Duran (left field), Rafaela (center) and Abreu (right field) entrenched as Boston’s starting outfield. The prevailing thought is that Anthony will take over in left field on a full-time basis with Duran shifting to center and Rafaela taking on a super-utility role. For now, though, he’ll play right field.', '“This was more about Willy,” Cora said. “We talked about it last night, where he was, probably missing one day or two. But we cannot play shorthanded for an extended period of time. It felt that way. We talked about it today and this is the decision we made as an organization.”', 'Anthony has played 243 innings in left field for the WooSox this season, 89 ⅓ innings in center field and just 36 in center (four games), where he’ll start Monday. Cora explained that the team wants to keep Duran in left and Rafaela in center with Abreu out and that they trust Anthony to man the spacious position at their home ballpark.', '“Today, it made sense to play him in right field,” Cora said. “Jarren has done an amazing job in left field with the wall. Ceddanne is the top defender in center field. He was actually playing right today. We’ll make adjustments on the fly but we’ll play him.”', '', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Rays 10, Red Sox 8 (F/11): Live to tie another day",https://www.draysbay.com/2025/6/9/24446383/rays-10-red-sox-8-f-11-live-to-tie-another-day-recap-june-9,"['FILED UNDER:', 'This game was bonkers.', 'Happy Monday, and time for a new series! This time, it’s against division rivals, the Red Sox, and the Rays are in enemy territory for the outing. The night was also a big deal as the Sox had called up MLB’s top prospect, Roman Anthony. The Rays weren’t in the mood to be wowed by hot prospects, though. They had Shane Baz on the mound, up against Brayan Bello for the Sox.', 'In the first, the Rays went 1-2-3 to start things off. The Sox did much the same in the home half.', 'In the second, Jake Mangum got a two-out single, then Kameron Misner doubled, putting two men in scoring position. The Rays, however, were not able to bring either runner home. In the bottom of the inning, Trevor Story got a leadoff single. Then, with two outs, Marcelo Mayer walked. Ceddanne Rafaela walked to load the bases, and then things got dramatic. As the original call stood, Connor Wong hit an RBI single. The Rays, though, challenged the call, and it was quickly obvious that Wong was out and the inning was over.', '', '', 'The Rays once again went 1-2-3 in the top of the third, and the Red Sox did the same in the home half.', 'Yandy Diaz and Jonathan Aranda got back-to-back singles in the top of the fourth. Junior Caminero popped into a double play but it was a slightly baffling one. Because of the high pop and the force out being in play, the call was an infield fly rule, so the Sox messed up when they didn’t tag Yandy out at third. They did tag Aranda out at second, and the pop out got Caminero. It was all a bit perplexing and led to another discussion where the Rays insisted on an explanation and one was given on field. Once that was settled, Mangum singled to score Diaz, putting the Rays on the board first.', '', '', 'In the home half, the Red Sox were three-up, three-down.', 'The Rays continued to apply pressure in the fifth, with Danny Jansen getting a free pass thanks to a hit-by-pitch with one out in the inning. Jansen advanced a bag on the next out, and then a Brandon Lowe single brought Jansen home. Yandy Diaz then singled to right, but it was a bad moment for new arrival Anthony, who let the single just roll right by his glove and to the outfield wall. The error allowed Lowe to score.', '', 'Marcelo Mayer started the home half with a leadoff double, then Rafaela singled right after him. Had Brandon Lowe not expertly blocked the hit from Rafaela, it might have scored a run. Connor Wong grounded into a double play that allowed Mayer to score but eliminated Rafaela and Wong. The Sox got one back but that was all they’d manage.', 'The Rays were 1-2-3 for the top of the sixth. In the home half Rafael Devers took a leadoff walk, then Abraham Toro was hit by a pitch. With one out, that was the end of the night for Baz. Garrett Cleavinger came on in relief and it was not a relief at all. With two outs, Kristian Campbell was hit by a pitch, then pinch-hitter Romy Gonzalez doubled, driving in two runs to tie up the game.', 'In the top of the seventh, Taylor Walls drew a walk. Then with one out, Bello’s night was over. Brennan Bernardino came in, so we swapped BB for BB. Walls stole second, then Josh Lowe doubled to bring Walls home and put the Rays back in the lead. The pitcher attempted a pickoff, which resulted in Lowe getting tangled in the legs of the second baseman before still managing to get to third safely. With two outs, Diaz was intentionally walked. A wild pitch then allowed Lowe to score. Aranda then doubled, to bring Diaz home. Just like that (and with a little luck from the Red Sox making mistakes) the Rays were back on top.', '', '', 'Eric Orze was next out of the Rays’ pen in the home half, and gave up a walk to Wong, then a double to Jarren Durran. With one out, a Toro groundout scored Wong. Manuel Rodríguez then replaced Orze. Trevor Story singled to score Durran and suddenly that new 3-run lead was dwindling. Story stole second, then Roman Anthony walked. But Rodriguez managed to get the final out of the inning and limit the damage while maintaining the lead.', 'In the eighth, the Rays had one baserunner with a two-out single from Walls, but no runs scored. With one out in the home half, Rafaela singled. With two outs it was Pete Fairbanks time, and that didn’t stop Rafaela from stealing second. It was a tense final out, but he got there.', 'In the top of the ninth, Jose Caballero walked with one out. Caballero then stole second. And then stole third just because, like, why not? Yandy Diaz walked to put runners on the corners. A looooong flyout from Aranda scored Caballero, and bumped Diaz up to second. They’d settle for the one run, but it was a helpful one.', '', '', 'Fairbanks was back out for the bottom of the ninth. Devers got a leadoff walk. Toro then lobbed a double off the Monster. Anthony collected his first RBI with a groundout, and now those two bonus runs the Rays got were looking extra beneficial. An RBI single from Campbell tied the game up at 7-7. Gonzalez then singled to short right and pushed Campbell to third. The Sox couldn’t manage the walk-off, so the game headed to the 10th.', 'Aroldis Chapman was in for the Red Sox, and gave up a leadoff single to Mangum, pushing free baserunner Caminero to third. Walls hit a sac fly to score Caminero. The one run was all they would get, but it might just be what they needed...', '', '', 'Ian Seymour came in for the Rays to really, seriously, hopefully hang on for the win this time. With two outs, Devers was intentionally walked. Toro reached on a fielding error by Aranda, Rafaela scored, and Devers got to third on a different error by Aranda. The rare double error. And that sent the game into the 11th.', 'Zack Kelly was next out for the Sox, Josh Lowe got a leadoff walk, then a Cabellero sac bunt pushed both baserunners to scoring position. With two outs, Aranda was intentionally walked to load the bases, then Caminero walked to score a run. Mangum then singled and there was no coverage at first on time, so Lowe scored. Would a two-run lead be enough? Who knows with this game, honestly?', '', '', 'A pinch-hitting Rob Refsnyder walked to start the home half of the eleventh. Seymour then collected the next two outs. With the strikeout of Gonzalez, Alex Cora came screaming out of the pen, but buddy, you can’t argue balls and strikes my man. The theatrics didn’t matter as a Rafaela lineout ended the inning. What a debut for Seymour, who got his first career win.', 'Final: Rays 10, Red Sox 8 (F/11)', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

In early May, the team lost first baseman Triston Casas to season-ending knee surgery.', 'In Bregman’s place, the club recalled Marcelo Mayer, their top infield prospect, and now Anthony joins the big-league club too. All three of Boston’s top prospects entering the season, including Kristian Campbell, who made the Opening Day roster, are now in the majors.', 'Anthony, a 2022 second-round draft pick, has shown prodigious power throughout his career, but has been particularly potent this season. He leads all minor leaguers with 32 barreled balls.', 'For Triple-A Worcester, he’s played 29 games in left field, 11 in center and four in right and served as designated hitter 14 games, mainly after a shoulder injury in late April.', 'Throughout his minor-league career, Anthony has routinely been the youngest hitter in his league, having just turned 21 on May 13. In 119 games between Double A and Triple A last season, he hit .291 with an .894 OPS, 32 doubles and 18 homers.', 'The Athletic’s Keith Law provided this assessment of Anthony as he prepares to make his Red Sox debut:', '“Anthony remains the top prospect in baseball, keeping his No. 1 status thanks to a strong start in Triple A that has him hitting the ball very hard (average exit velocity above 95 mph and 90th percentile EV at 109.4 mph. He’s had more swing-and-miss than you’d like to see and he’s been particularly vulnerable to changeups down and away and offspeed pitches. I imagine that’s what he will see a lot of at the start of his MLB career.”', '', 'With Abreu on the IL, Anthony takes over in right for now. Ceddanne Rafaela could play some right field in future games but has played only one big-league game at the position.

He notched his first career RBI when Rafael Devers scored on a groundout in the bottom of the ninth inning.', '""We\'re trying to win ballgames,"" manager Alex Cora said before the game. ""The kid has done an amazing job getting ready for this moment. We\'re excited. It\'s a big day for the organization.""', 'Anthony, 21, arrives in the big leagues with polish rare for a player his age. A second-round draft pick in 2022, he blitzed through the minor leagues, reaching Double-A in his first full season in 2023, dominating between Double-A and Triple-A in 2024 and crushing Triple-A pitching with his sweet left-handed swing this season.', ""Calls for his promotion were resounding among Red Sox fans, whose frustration with the team's start left them looking to Anthony as a potential solution to their ills. The Red Sox are now 32-36 after Monday's loss."", 'Boston was loath to summon Anthony, with chief baseball officer Craig Breslow suggesting he needed more experience in left field and fewer balls hit on the ground. His arrival comes on the heels of a 497-foot grand slam -- the longest ball hit at any level of organized baseball this season -- for Triple-A Worcester over the weekend.', 'Anthony hit .288/.423/.491 at Triple-A with 10 home runs and 29 RBIs in 265 plate appearances. Known as much for his discerning eye as his immense power, the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Anthony walked 51 times and struck out 56 for Worcester.', 'Where he will play with the Red Sox is a question that has vexed team officials -- and contributed to him not already having joined infielders Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer, with whom Anthony comprised the so-called big three, in the major leagues. Boston has All-Star Jarren Duran in left field, Gold Glove candidate Ceddanne Rafaela in center field and Wilyer Abreu, whose bat has thrived this season, in right field. However, the Red Sox placed Abreu on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain in a corresponding move on Monday.', 'Boston nonetheless deemed now the right time to call up Anthony. Because his promotion was delayed until now, Anthony will not be eligible for free agency until after the 2031 season -- unless he wins American League Rookie of the Year, which would come with a full year of service time and push his clock up to the 2030 season. Absent the award, Anthony also could miss being a Super Two, a category designated for the players in each class with the most service time. Avoiding Super Two status, which gives players a fourth year of negotiating their salary via arbitration, could save Boston upwards of $10 million.', '""It\'s been a long time coming,"" said Mayer, who was called up about two weeks ago. ""It\'s been talked about for a very long time, and it\'s kind of crazy that today\'s the day that we\'re all going to share the field together in the big leagues. I\'m super excited. I think we have a really good team, and he\'s just another great addition to that.""', 'Multiple officials and players in the Red Sox organization were clamoring for Anthony to head to Fenway Park well before Monday. His leap from Low-A to High-A to Double-A in 2023 placed him among the prospect elite throughout baseball, and Anthony has done nothing to disqualify himself from that since.', '""It happened quick,"" Anthony said. ""I think no matter when that call comes, nobody\'s really expecting it.""', ""He more than held his own at the top two levels of the minor leagues last year as a 20-year-old, finishing with a .291/.396/.498 line with 18 home runs and 21 stolen bases. Particularly impressive was his strike-zone discipline. Anthony's rate of swinging at pitches outside of the strike zone at Triple-A this year would rank among the best in the major leagues."", 'Boston could find room for him in the lineup by moving Rafaela to second base -- where he has played regularly -- and sliding Campbell over to first base. Boston lost its first baseman, Triston Casas, to a season-ending knee injury and also is playing without arguably its best player, third baseman Alex Bregman, who is out with a strained quadriceps.', 'A number of Red Sox players, from Bregman to new ace Garrett Crochet to catcher Carlos Narvaez, have exceeded expectations this season -- and Boston has still struggled. The Red Sox lead MLB in errors and have a 6-17 record in one-run games.
