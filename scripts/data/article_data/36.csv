So, if you want to join in and watch the event live, here's how you can do it. You can also check out what's in store for you. "", ""This year, Apple has revealed an impressive range of offerings for its annual WWDC, featuring the highly anticipated Keynote and Platforms State of the Union.

', ""You can watch the WWDC 2025 livestream on Apple's official website, Apple TV app, and the Apple YouTube channel. "", ""This year, Apple is expected to focus less on shiny new features and more on visual glow-up. At the event, iOS 19 is expected to garner the maximum eyeballs due to reports that it will be “one of the most dramatic software overhauls” in Apple's history, according to Bloomberg. "", ""The latest update would likely have a new interface designed to provide Apple's various products - including iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc - a consistent appearance. Drawing inspiration from the visionOS, Apple is also expected to redesign the appearance of icons, menus and apps."", 'According to TechCrunch, this year, Apple might also ditch the version number in favour of calendar-based naming. Meaning, instead of iOS 19 or macOS 15, Apple might introduce iOS 2026 and macOS 2026. Notably, iOS 26 is expected to bring a handful of practical upgrades, including Simplified WiFi sharing across Apple devices. ', ""On the AI front, Apple is expected to share a few updates. At WWDC, it may announce support for other AI chatbots. Apple's health app could also soon incorporate AI technology, which could include a health chatbot and generative AI insights that provide personalised health-related suggestions based on user data. "", 'Moreover, other apps, such as Messages, may receive enhancements with AI capabilities, including a translation feature and polls that offer AI-generative suggestions.

It could also integrate with iMessage or FaceTime for remote gaming, per TechCrunch. "", ""Apart from software changes, Apple could also bring a live-translate language feature to its AirPods wireless Bluetooth earbuds, allowing real-time translation during conversations. AirPods may also get new head gestures to complement today's ability to either nod or shake your head to respond to incoming calls or messages. "", 'Additionally, AirPods may get features to auto-pause music after you fall asleep, a way to trigger the camera via Camera Control with a touch, a studio-quality mic mode, and an improved pairing experience in shared AirPods.', ""This year's WWDC will not feature new hardware.

Leak reveals which Apple Watches will run watchOS 26,https://www.macworld.com/article/2806705/leak-reveals-which-apple-watches-will-run-watchos-26.html,"[""When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence."", 'Good news, Apple Watch owners. If you’ve got a Series 6 or later, it looks like you’ll be able to install and run watchOS 26.', 'On June 9, as part of its WWDC keynote presentation, Apple will announce this year’s big software update for the Apple Watch, and the current theory is that this will be called watchOS 26 (as in the year 2026). This will contain new features and likely a redesigned interface, and best of all, it won’t cost a penny to install.', 'The real question, however, is whether you’ll be able to run it. Not every Apple Watch can run every version of watchOS, because they become more spec-intensive over time as Apple includes more demanding features and more complex graphical elements.', 'If you had a Series 4 or later you could run watchOS 10 when it launched two years ago, but the Series 4 and Series 5 were both dropped from the list of supported devices when watchOS 11 came out in 2024. Series 6 owners will therefore be scanning the tech news sites nervously to see if they’ll be able to grab the update this year.', 'The good news is that Apple doesn’t seem to be planning to drop any more devices this year. According to a credible new leak reported by MacRumors, the list of supported Apple Watches for watchOS 26 will be the same as it was for watchOS 11: the Series 6 and later. The only change will be the addition of the late-2025 watches.', 'To be frank, this could have been predicted before the leak emerged. Apple has never cut watches from its supported list two years in a row: watchOS 5, 7, 9, and 11 all dropped models (sometimes multiple models at once), but the ones in between kept things steady. It would have been a major surprise if Apple had swung the hatchet for a second year running.', 'To be fair, that surprising turn of events could yet happen. MacRumors’ source is a private account on X/Twitter, and while the site insists this source has “a proven track record for upcoming software updates,” it’s impossible to be sure they’re right on this occasion. The only way to know the truth with any certainty will be to tune into the WWDC keynote on June 9. Macworld, needless to say, will be covering all the announcements as they happen.', 'David has been writing about technology for well over two decades, and got on board the Apple hype train when covering the original iPhone launch in 2007.

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)', 'In a somewhat overdue move, Apple plans to open up the Apple Watch Control Centre to widgets from third-party developers with watchOS 26.', 'After years of keeping the Control Centre strictly limited to its own toggles and tools, Apple appears ready to loosen its notorious grip with watchOS 26 by introducing third-party widgets.', 'I’ve been covering Apple’s wearable strategy since the first Watch launched, and this shift represents one of the most meaningful functional improvements in years. According to a source for 9to5Mac familiar with Apple’s plans, developers will soon have the ability to create their own widgets for the Control Centre—a change that expands what users can do on their Watch without diving into apps.', 'For those unfamiliar with the current setup, the Apple Watch Control Centre provides quick access to essential functions like Wi-Fi settings, battery levels, and Focus Mode toggles. However, it’s remained stubbornly closed to outside developers since its introduction.', 'Widgets on mobile devices were once associated with Android but have become an increasing focus of Apple in recent years. The company has gradually embraced widgets across iOS and iPadOS, making this watchOS expansion feel somewhat inevitable—if significantly overdue.', 'Beyond simply allowing third-party widgets, sources claim Apple is completely overhauling how users manage the Control Centre of their Watch. The current method of customising this space on the watch itself is frankly cumbersome. The new approach will move these controls to the Watch app on iPhone, letting users easily add, remove, and reorder widgets through a far more intuitive interface.', 'The practical implications are substantial. Imagine a quick-glance weather forecast when you’re deciding whether to grab a brolly, or a one-tap smart home control to lock your doors without fumbling through apps. Fitness enthusiasts could benefit from instant workout activation, while health-conscious users might appreciate hydration trackers with single-tap logging capabilities.', 'Support for third-party widgets is precisely the type of quality-of-life improvement that many Apple Watch users have been requesting. The ability to access critical information and functions without navigating through applications dramatically enhances the user experience on a small-screen device.', 'I’ve previously spoken with several developers who’ve expressed frustration at the limitations of the current watchOS framework. Many have clever ideas that would benefit from Control Centre integration but have been unable to implement them due to Apple’s restrictions. This opening up represents a major shift in Apple’s wearable strategy.', 'The timing feels appropriate, too. The Apple Watch interface has started to feel somewhat dated compared to the company’s other platforms. While complications on watch faces offer some customisation, they’re constrained by space and design limitations that the Control Centre doesn’t share.', 'This change will likely be announced alongside a suite of other updates at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9th. Substantial design refreshes and functional improvements appear to be the focus across Apple’s platforms this year.', 'For Apple Watch enthusiasts, particularly those who’ve invested in the ecosystem of third-party apps, widgets from outside developers can’t come soon enough.

All the sweet new watchOS features we expect at WWDC25,https://www.cultofmac.com/news/watchos-rumors-wwdc25,"['BY GRAHAM BOWER • 6:00 AM, JUNE 4, 2025', 'There’s less than a week to go until WWDC, the annual developer fest where Apple takes the wraps off its latest OS releases. While the rumor mill has mostly focused on iPhone this year, there’s plenty for Apple Watch fans to look forward to.', 'Rumor has it that the next big watch update — possibly dubbed “watchOS 26,” in line with Apple’s rumored naming convention shakeup — will get a fresh new user interface, Apple Intelligence, conversation transcriptions and a smart AI coach that delivers tailored health and fitness advice.', 'Let’s roll up our sleeves and take a closer look at what’s in store for Apple Watch.', 'A decade after the Apple Watch debuted, the smartwatch has morphed into one of the most intimate and health-focused devices in Apple’s ecosystem. It tracks heart rates and workouts, nudges us to stand, and even calls emergency services during crises.', 'Now, with watchOS poised for another evolution, Apple appears ready to double down on that role. Apple Watch rumors always seem scarcer than iPhone rumors. But at WWDC 2025, the company is expected to introduce a smarter, more context-aware version of watchOS, wrapped in a visionOS-inspired design that jibes with the rest of Apple’s refreshed operating systems.', 'The most obvious change to watchOS will probably be its name. According to Bloomberg’s veteran rumormonger Mark Gurman, watchOS will jump from version 11 to version 26, aligning with all Apple’s operating systems. This sounds like particularly good news for Apple Watch fans. You’d have to be a hard-core Apple geek to remember that watchOS 11 works with iOS 18. iOS 26 and watchOS 26 will be much more obvious bedfellows.', 'watchOS got a major redesign just two years ago with watchOS 10. At the time, Apple’s VP of technology, Kevin Lynch, called it a “major milestone.” The redesign introduced a new visual language that took full advantage of the larger screen sizes of recent Apple Watch models.', 'It might seem strange for watchOS to receive another makeover so soon. But according to the rumors, this is all part of a bigger plan, dubbed “Solarium” internally at Apple. Solarium reportedly will introduce a new, consistent design language across all Apple’s platforms, including watchOS.', 'Since watchOS benefited from a big design refresh so recently, this year’s changes are likely to be minor. But we can probably expect some visual touches inspired by visionOS, like translucent glass effects and buttons with beveled edges that catch the light as you move your wrist.', 'When Cupertino rolled out Apple Intelligence last year, Apple Watch was conspicuously absent from the list of supported devices. That could change this year, with rumors suggesting AI features are heading to a wrist near you.', 'The current absence of Apple Intelligence could be due to hardware limitations. The Apple Watch Ultra 2’s neural engine only has four cores. That’s nothing compared to the whopping 16-core Neural Engine the latest iPhones are packing.', 'Apple might get around this limitation by offloading intensive AI processing to your iPhone. This could enable your Apple Watch to deliver some basic AI features like Genmoji, notification summaries and new Siri capabilities. But only when your iPhone is within range.', 'This year’s changes could be the first small step toward a much more ambitious AI plan for Apple Watch. Rumors indicate Apple wants to add a camera to future models to deliver Visual Intelligence.', 'Apple already previewed some upcoming accessibility features on Global Accessibility Awareness Day last month. So we don’t need rumormongers to know some of the neat features the next version of watchOS has in store for us.', 'watchOS will gain controls for Live Listen, a feature that allows you to use your iPhone as a remote mic and stream audio to AirPods. Plus, live transcriptions of conversations will appear on your watch screen as mini subtitles. Unfortunately, checking your watch when someone is talking to you is a pretty unsubtle dis. So this feature could prove problematic.', 'Personally, the accessibility feature I’m eagerly waiting for is support for streaming audio to Made for iPhone hearing aids. You can already do this with iPhone, iPad and Mac. The Apple Watch is the last major Apple hardware platform not to offer this feature.', 'Rumors of an AI-powered fitness coach have been doing the rounds for years. Back in 2023, Bloomberg’s Gurman reported that Apple planned to “use AI and data from an Apple Watch to make suggestions and create coaching programs tailored to specific users.”', 'The project, apparently dubbed “Quartz” internally, could be an exclusive new feature for Fitness+ subscribers.', 'As a fitness buff myself, I have my doubts about all this. Real coaches know everything about their athletes’ capabilities and weaknesses. They relentlessly observe training sessions to make sure their programs are safe and effective. Can Apple Watch really gather enough data to safely and reliably provide this kind of advice? And would Apple be liable for any injuries if an AI coach hallucinated?', 'Quartz would be a bold move for a company that has previously been so measured in its fitness claims that it only ever promised that closing your Activity Rings would help you live a healthier day.', 'If a virtual fitness coach wasn’t ambitious enough, Apple is also considering adding AI-powered health coaches to the Health app. Internally dubbed “Project Mulberry,” this could form part of a new subscription service dubbed Apple Health+. According to Gurman, it would be Apple’s “biggest health care push to date with a revamped app and AI doctor service.”', 'Project Mulberry would draw on the data collected from the health sensors in your Apple Watch to deliver individually tailored health and lifestyle recommendations.', 'Food tracking would play a central role ing this offering, putting Apple in direct competition with calorie-counting apps like Lose It. This simplistic “calories in, calories out” approach to weight loss is increasingly challenged by experts. So it’s odd timing for Apple to move into this area.', 'Gurman suggests Project Mulberry might not ship until spring or summer of 2026, which means we might not see it at this year’s WWDC.', 'In recent years, Apple has kept up with Garmin by adding new training metrics every year at WWDC. We’ve seen the addition of metrics like heart rate variability, VO2 Max, Running & Cycling Power, Effort and Training Load.', 'So, what new metrics can we expect this year? The rumor mill doesn’t provide any clues, but the smart money is on training readiness and body battery, features that Garmin already offers. Training readiness analyzes things like your sleep history and stress levels to assess whether you should push yourself with a workout. The Body Battery feature in Garmin watches lets you “monitor your personal energy resources around the clock,” according to the company.', 'There are only a few sleeps left now before Apple CEO Tim Cook and his team reveal all during the WWDC25 keynote on June 9.

Apple Watch to Get Support for Third-Party Widgets: Report,https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/06/06/apple-watch-third-party-widgets/,"['', 'Apple might finally bring support for third-party Control Center widgets to the Apple Watch with its next big watchOS update, per a report from 9to5Mac.', 'Rumour has it that Apple is readying radical redesigns for its platforms with this year’s batch of major software updates, due to be unveiled at WWDC 2025 next week. A recent leak suggested that the tech giant will also switch from a version-based naming scheme for its OS iterations to a year-based system, meaning the next Apple Watch update will be called watchOS 26 instead of watchOS 19.', '“According to a reliable source, watchOS 26 will allow developers to plug their own widgets directly into the Control Center. This will let users surface relevant actions or data from third-party apps alongside Wi-Fi, Battery, and Focus Mode,” 9to5Mac noted.', 'Until now, the Apple Watch’s Control Center was limited to Apple’s own toggles and widgets. This could change with watchOS 26, which will supposedly make the area extremely customizable. Users will be able to easily add, remove, or reorder Control Center widgets from the Watch app on iPhone, making for an intuitive and highly-requested quality-of-life upgrade.', 'While an Apple Watch with a camera might still be years away, enhanced Control Center customizability and third-party Control Center widgets could be coming to the Apple Watch as early as this year. Stay tuned for our coverage of WWDC 2025, where Apple will showcase watchOS 26 and much more. The keynote kicks off Monday, June 9, at 10 am PT/1 pm ET.']",Technology,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUlabFIxVFRWdk5sTjZXV3A1VFJDSEF4aVBCaWdLTWdZbGRZN09NUVk=-w280-h168-p-df
