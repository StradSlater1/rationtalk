It is the result of damaged lung tissue, which leads to inflammation that irritates the airway and limits airflow. Because such damage usually worsens over time, ""COPD mostly affects people who are 50 or older,"" Dr. Shawn Aaron, senior scientist of the inflammation and chronic disease program at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada, previously told USA TODAY.', ""Here's what medical experts want you to know about COPD."", 'Common symptoms of COPD include wheezing, chest tightness, a painful and persistent cough (with and without accompanying mucus) and fatigue. ""Another of the most worrisome features of the disease can be periodic flare-ups, called exacerbations, which can greatly diminish your ability to breathe,"" Dr. Meilan King Han, pulmonary diseases specialist at University of Michigan Health, previously told USA TODAY. Due to the severity of such episodes, ""some COPD patients can end up hospitalized,"" she added. ', 'COPD also makes people more vulnerable to respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Related complications are why ""COPD is a leading cause of death both in America and worldwide,"" Dr. David Mannino, chief medical officer at the COPD Foundation in Florida, previously told USA TODAY.', 'At least 15 million adults have some form of COPD, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but Mannino said it could be twice that number, because the condition often goes misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.', 'The damaged lung tissue associated with COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritants, such as fumes, dust, chemicals or smoke. This is why ""cigarette smoke is the main cause of COPD in high-income countries like the United States,"" Mannino said. ""However, not everyone who smokes will develop COPD symptoms, and not all people with COPD have a history of smoking."" Indeed, some 25% of people with COPD have never smoked a cigarette.', '""Exposure to outdoor pollution or indoor cooking smoke and fumes is a major cause of COPD,"" said Aaron, especially in developing countries. He added that some people also develop the condition because of poor early lung development related to premature birth. ', 'Genetic factors, early-life respiratory infections and a history of asthma ""can all also contribute to the development of COPD,"" Han said.', 'Regardless of what\'s causing the condition, COPD is treatable. ""The mainstays of therapy have historically been inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids,"" according to Han. Such medications can reduce breathlessness, improve stamina and lower one\'s risk of flare-ups, Mannino said. ', 'He added that non-pharmacologic therapies are also helpful in reducing symptoms and risk of flare-ups. ""These include participating in pulmonary rehabilitation, using oxygen therapy as prescribed and adhering to vaccination guidelines,"" he said. And you can\'t overemphasize the importance of quitting smoking, added Aaron.', '""By adhering to medication recommendations, avoiding infection and irritating fumes, eating foods that support lung health and strengthening lung tissue by getting plenty of cardiovascular activity,"" said Mannino, ""individuals with COPD can maintain a good quality of life.""', 'Contributing: Daryl Austin and Marco della Cava']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.”', '', 'Sly and the Family Stone burst onto the scene in 1968 with the cathartic “Dance to the Music” and followed with a string of crossover smash hits that defined their hometown San Francisco’s “Summer of Love,” including “Stand!,” “Hot Fun in the Summertime,” “Runnin’ Away,” “If You Want Me to Stay” and “Time for Livin’.”', 'The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and inspired everyone from Herbie Hancock to George Clinton’s P-Funk, Michael Jackson, Curtis Mayfield, Bob Marley, The Isley Brothers, Prince, Public Enemy, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Black Eyed Peas, The Roots, OutKast and Kendrick Lamar. Stone’s life was the subject of significant discussion this year thanks to Questlove’s documentary Sly Lives, which was released to significant acclaim earlier this year.', '“Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,” Sly’s family said. “His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable. In a testament to his enduring creative spirit, Sly recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course, which follows a memoir published in 2024.”', '', 'Born on March 15, 1943, in Denton, Texas, Sylvester Stewart came from a family of devout Christians who took their beliefs with them when they moved to Vallejo, California, a suburb northwest of San Francisco. Reared on church music, he was 8 when he and three of his siblings recorded a gospel single as The Stewart Four.', 'A musical prodigy who picked up the name “Sly” in grade school, Stone was adept at keyboards, guitar, bass and drums by 11, and he went on to perform in several high school bands, one of which, The Viscaynes, boasted a then unheard-of mixed lineup and released a few singles.', 'After attending Vallejo Junior College, Stone got a job as a fast-talking DJ at San Francisco R&B station KSOL, where his eclectic taste stoked his popularity, working the new British bands like The Beatles, The Animals and The Stones into the station’s soul format.', 'By the time he brought his show to crosstown KDIA, he had already been producing records for the local label, Autumn Records, thanks to DJ Tom Donahue, who recommended him. The company was the home for such Bay Area bands as The Beau Brummels, The Charlatans, The Great Society and The Mojo Men. In 1964, Stone produced Bobby Freeman’s Top-5 pop hit, “C’mon and Swim.”', 'After leading a band called Sly and the Stoners, featuring trumpet player Cynthia Robinson, Stone brought in his brother Freddie on guitar, sister Rose on keyboards, Gregg Errico on drums, Jerry Martini on sax and Larry Graham on bass to complete Sly and the Family Stone.', '', 'They drew the interest of Epic Records, where they signed and released their debut album, A Whole New Thing at the end of 1967’s Summer of Love.', 'Despite critical acclaim, A Whole New Thing failed to resonate with audiences. However, the subsequent release of a new single, “Dance to the Music,” from the album of the same name, vaulted into the top-10 on both the pop and R&B charts.', '“Everyday People” (and its B-side, “Sing a Simple Song”), released in late 1968 and followed by the album Stand! In May of 1969, marked the crossover emergence of the band, going to No. 1 on both the pop and R&B charts, followed by the title track and its B-side, “I Want To Take You Higher.” The album climbed to No. 3 R&B and No. 13 pop, the band’s first certified platinum seller, with iconic non-singles such as “Sex Machine.”', 'There’s a Riot Goin’ On is arguably Stone’s masterpiece, both critically and commercially — it went to the top of both the Pop and R&B album charts within a few weeks of its release in November 1971. The transformative masterpiece of race and song — a template for the later work of Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, among others —  the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.', 'That turned out to be Sly’s last hurrah. In June 1973, the band released a new single, “If You Want Me to Stay.” (The departures of Graham and Errico during this period hastened the band’s demise.)', 'Continuing with Epic, Sly recorded High on You in 1975 and Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back a year later.', '', 'In June 1983, Stone was arrested in Fort Myers, Florida, and charged with cocaine possession.', 'He toured with Bobby Womack, recorded with Jesse Johnson and released several songs from soundtracks, including “Eek-a-Boo Static Automatic” for Soul Man (1986) and “I’m the Burglar” for Burglar (1987).', 'Stone sightings were sporadic after that, though he did appear for his Rock Hall induction and at the 2006 Grammys, where he briefly and bizarrely participated in a multi-artist tribute to the band featuring John Legend, Fantasia, Adam Levine, Ciara, Steve Tyler and Joe Perry.

Terrill, File', 'Sly Stone, the revolutionary musician and dynamic showman whose Sly and the Family Stone transformed popular music in the 1960s and ’70s and beyond with such hits as “Everyday People,” “Stand!” and “Family Affair,” died Monday at age 82.', 'Stone, born Sylvester Stewart, had been in poor health in recent years. His publicist Carleen Donovan said Stone died in Los Angeles surrounded by family after contending with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments.', 'Formed in 1966-67, Sly and the Family Stone was the first major group to include Black and white men and women, and well embodied a time when anything seemed possible — riots and assassinations, communes and love-ins. The singers screeched, chanted, crooned and hollered. The music was a blowout of frantic horns, rapid-fire guitar and locomotive rhythms, a melting pot of jazz, psychedelic rock, doo-wop, soul and the early grooves of funk.', 'Stone’s group began as a Bay Area sextet featuring Sly on keyboards, Larry Graham on bass; Sly’s brother, Freddie, on guitar; sister Rose on vocals; Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini horns and Greg Errico on drums. They debuted with the album “A Whole New Thing” and earned the title with their breakthrough single, “Dance to the Music.” It hit the top 10 in April 1968, the week the Rev. Martin Luther King was murdered, and helped launch an era when the polish of Motown and the understatement of Stax suddenly seemed of another time.', 'Led by Sly Stone, with his leather jumpsuits and goggle shades, mile-wide grin and mile-high Afro, the band dazzled in 1969 at the Woodstock festival and set a new pace on the radio. “Everyday People,” “I Wanna Take You Higher” and other songs were anthems of community, non-conformity and a brash and hopeful spirit, built around such catchphrases as “different strokes for different folks.” The group released five top 10 singles, three of them hitting No. 1, and three million-selling albums: “Stand!”, “There’s a Riot Goin’ On” and “Greatest Hits.”', 'Sly’s influence has endured for decades. The top funk artist of the 1970s, Parliament-Funkadelic creator George Clinton, was a Stone disciple. Prince, Rick James and the Black-Eyed Peas were among the many performers from the 1980s and after influenced by Sly, and countless rap artists have sampled his riffs, from the Beastie Boys to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. A 2005 tribute record included Maroon 5, John Legend and the Roots.', 'By the early ’70s, Stone himself was beginning a descent from which he never recovered, driven by the pressures of fame and the added burden of Black fame. His record company was anxious for more hits, while the Black Panthers were pressing him to drop the white members from his group. After moving from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in 1970, he became increasingly hooked on cocaine and erratic in his behavior.', 'On “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” Stone had warned: “Dying young is hard to take/selling out is harder.” Late in 1971, he released “There’s a Riot Going On,” one of the grimmest, most uncompromising records ever to top the album charts. The sound was dense and murky (Sly was among the first musicians to use drum machines), the mood reflective (“Family Affair”), fearful (“Runnin’ Away”) and despairing: “Time, they say, is the answer — but I don’t believe it,” Sly sings on “Time.” The fast, funky pace of the original “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” was slowed, stretched and retitled “Thank You For Talkin’ to Me, Africa.”', 'By the end of the decade, Sly and the Family Stone had broken up and Sly was releasing solo records with such unmet promises as “Heard You Missed Me, Well I’m Back” and “Back On the Right Track.” Most of the news he made over the following decades was of drug busts, financial troubles and mishaps on stage. Sly and the Family Stone was inducted into the Rock & Roll of Fame in 1993 and honored in 2006 at the Grammy Awards, but Sly released just one album after the early ’80s, “I’m Back! Family & Friends,” much of it updated recordings of his old hits.', 'He was born Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, and raised in Vallejo, California, the second of five children in a close, religious family. Sylvester became “Sly” by accident, when a teacher mistakenly spelled his name “Slyvester.”', 'He loved performing so much that his mother alleged he would cry if the congregation in church didn’t respond when he sang before it. He was so gifted and ambitious that by age 4 he had sung on stage at a Sam Cooke show and by age 11 had mastered several instruments and recorded a gospel song with his siblings. He was so committed to the races working together that in his teens and early 20s he was playing in local bands that included Black and white members and was becoming known around the Bay Area as a deejay equally willing to play the Beatles and rhythm and blues acts.', '“A Whole New Thing” came out in 1967, soon followed by the single “Dance to the Music,” in which each member was granted a moment of introduction as the song rightly proclaimed a “brand new beat.” In December 1968, the group appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and performed a medley that included “Dance to the Music” and “Everyday People.” Before the set began, Sly turned to the audience and recited a brief passage from his song “Are You Ready”:', '“Don’t hate the Black,', 'RECOMMENDED', 'Mk.gee N.J. concert review: Jersey’s latest breakthrough artist finds glory in simplicityJun. 5, 2025, 10:28 a.m.', 'How old is the ‘Phineas and Ferb’ cast now?Jun. 5, 2025, 4:05 p.m.', 'don’t hate the white,', 'if you get bitten,', 'just hate the bite.”', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Sly Stone was a trailblazer who changed the course of music – and an icon of both hope and pain,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/10/sly-stone-cause-of-death-funk-music,"['With the Family Stone, Sly was so audacious it was hard to believe his brilliance could ever be exhausted – making his unravelling all the more painful to watch', 'Sly Stone, pioneering funk and soul musician, dies aged 82', 'Sly Stone’s greatest songs – ranked!', 'Sly Stone – a life in pictures', 'E\nven though he recorded three of funk’s most foundational albums – four if you include 1970’s Greatest Hits, as flawless a good time as pop ever delivered – Sly Stone’s subsequent fall from grace was perceived as a grave betrayal of his talent. That Stone’s unravelling was so conspicuous – his drug abuse apparent in every wasted chat show appearance, his infallible hit-machine waning after his Family Stone became estranged – only exacerbated the sting of this loss. But Stone’s imperial era lasted almost a decade and delivered a discography that remains the acme of funk. He changed the course of pop and reconfigured the structure and essence of dance music, multiple times. He was an icon of hope, of pain, of pride. He was Icarus, for sure. But when it mattered, boy did he fly.', 'On arrival, his brilliance was so audacious it was hard to believe it could ever be exhausted. He seemed to tease this himself on 1968’s Life, promising, “You don’t have to come down!” Perhaps this confidence sprang from his knowledge that he’d already stumbled before he’d soared. The Family Stone’s 1967 debut album, A Whole New Thing – restlessly and inventively mashing psychedelia, soul, funk and rock into, well, a whole new thing – had been too much too soon, and baffled audiences. But the following year’s Dance to the Music simplified the formula and brought new focus, its title track and the 12-minute Dance to the Medley sounding a call to funk the world couldn’t resist.', 'Soon, Sly was everywhere. There he was with his sister Rose, ice-cool but wholesome, sweeping into the audience of The Ed Sullivan Show and getting an America riven by racism, Vietnam and the generation gap to spell out “L-O-V-E” together in their front rooms. There he was at Woodstock, glitter-daubed and wearing stack-heeled boots like they were ballet pumps, so wired and righteous the subsequent split-screen concert movie could barely contain him. A slew of killer singles sketched out Sly’s polymorphous concept, but it was 1969’s Stand!, his first perfect album, that gave it space to breathe. The title track was an anthem of Black power that could be sung by anybody, with a funk breakdown no body could resist. Everyday People was a hymn to the integrational dream the multi-racial, multi-gender Family Stone embodied. Don’t Call Me N*****, Whitey put voice to the resentments sparking uprisings across the nation. The deep funk epic Sex Machine was the source from whence Miles Davis’s 70s electric output later sprang.', 'The year closed out with a further triumph: the standalone single Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), on which the Family Stone’s Larry Graham reinvented bass guitar by slapping and plucking his strings with percussive fury. This was heavy street music, Sly’s homilies of peace and hope replaced by something more uncertain, more confessional. Stone had signalled the wind-change that July with Hot Fun in the Summertime, a candy floss cloud whose doo-wop croon doubled as an account of a summer torn up by protests and riots. But Thank You made the disquiet explicit and detailed the riot going on within Stone, as he wrestled with the devil, ruminating that, “Dyin’ young is hard to take / Selling out is harder.”', 'These were the stakes for Stone in 1969, facing down death and failure. Lesser artists would choke under such pressure; instead, Stone reached for his masterpiece. But the very height of his brilliance was itself symptomatic of what would bring him down. 1971’s There’s A Riot Goin’ On was recorded as the Family Stone were drifting apart, Sly hanging out and getting so high with muso mates at his home studio over long, hazy sessions where no one was sure who played what or if they even played at all. Loose, funky chaos reigned. “We never planned anything – I just walked in and saw a microphone there and a guitar, and started playing with him,” Stone’s friend, soul legend Bobby Womack, told me in 2012. “There was a riot goin’ on, alright – it was at Sly’s house!”', 'On There’s A Riot Goin’ On, much of what had previously defined a Sly Stone record – the brightness, the hooks, the hope – bled away, in their place a disorientatingly murky production, the tape itself disintegrating under the strain of compulsive overdubs. On the album’s chart-topping hit, Family Affair, Stone’s mush-mouthed croon distorts in the mix; you can’t make out the words, but his warm, wise crackle spells out what he’s saying. Elsewhere, his incisive gift for aphorisms remained intact, but now focused on a darkening world; Runnin’ Away and (You Caught Me) Smilin’ were as perfect as any pop song Stone ever wrote, but their sunshine hooks were stained with sadness. And a rerun of Thank You, now titled Thank You For Talkin’ To Me Africa, slowed Graham’s formerly propulsive bass riff to a swampy slog, the chorus chants now recast as ghostly murmurs. The devil, it seemed, was now winning.', 'Stone began to haunt his studio day and night, which was good because he was now habitually missing gigs. He kept overdubbing and remixing 1973’s Fresh even after it had hit the shelves, paring away more and more instrumentation in search of skeletal funk perfection. Skin I’m In found Stone more at ease than he had sounded for years; If You Want Me To Stay was Stone finding peace in self-acceptance, a love song that doubled as a warning to take him as he was (“For me to stay here / I got to be me”). But the chaos surrounding Stone was increasing, much of it self-inflicted. The Family Stone disbanded following 1974’s Small Talk, often cited as where Sly’s genius left the stage. In fact, the album is located in a similar pocket to Fresh: the songs aren’t as strong and it leans too hard on new Family member, violinist Sid Page, but the title track’s squelchy funk is sparse and electrifying, while the Beastie Boys loved Loose Booty enough to lift its chorus for their Shadrach. The sleeve featured Stone with young son Sylvester Jr and wife Kathleen Silva in familial embrace; they’d married onstage at Madison Square Garden that June, and separate two years later after Stone’s dog mauled Sly Jr.', '“You don’t have to come down,” Sly had sung back in 1968. Actually, of course you do. The slide began slowly – his 1975 solo album High On You was worth the price of entry for the synth-driven title track and the brilliantly discordant funk of Crossword Puzzle and the sinful howls of Who Do You Love? alone. But there’s little to love on 1976’s Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back, purportedly a Family Stone reunion but, in truth, as much a one-man band as the one Stone portrayed on the hokey sleeve. A move to Warner Bros for 1979’s inaccurately titled album Back on the Right Track delivered a last hit, Remember Who You Are, which tapped Stone’s magic one final time. But by his farewell, 1982’s Ain’t But the One Way, the well had run dry; its 34 minutes drag.', 'Then Sly pretty much disappeared, his life engulfed by crack cocaine, legal disputes and homelessness. He would occasionally resurface, stoking hopes for a final glorious act in the saga, the comeback record his legacy deserved. But, as Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s documentary Sly Lives – subtitled “the burden of Black genius” – argues, that was too much to ask of Sly Stone, who’d already given so much, and had earned the right to fade away and find his peace. As he sang over half-a-century earlier in Stand!: “In the end, you’ll still be you / One that’s done all the things you set out to do.” His burdens had brought him down to Earth, hard and for good. But there were few who had flown so high.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

"SLY STONE, FAMILY STONE ARCHITECT WHO FUSED FUNK, ROCK, AND SOUL, DEAD AT 82",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sly-and-the-family-stone-dead-obituary-1234810064/,"['By ELIAS LEIGHT', 'Sly Stone, one of the most influential and groundbreaking musicians of the late Sixties and early Seventies who smashed the boundaries of rock, pop, funk, and soul, died on Monday. He was 82. The cause of death was a “prolonged battle with COPD and other underlying health issues,” according to a statement by his family.', '“It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved dad, Sly Stone of Sly and the Family Stone,” Stone’s family said. “Sly passed away peacefully, surrounded by his three children, his closest friend, and his extended family. While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.”', 'The family added that Stone “recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course.” ', 'At the peak of his success, when hits like “Dance to the Music” and “Everyday People” were high on the charts, the wildly inventive musician and singer presented a glowingly optimistic image in step with the times, bringing together Black and white audiences, uplifting crowds with electrifying shows. But the unpredictability that was the core of his genius gave way to a long decline, as his personal demons destroyed what he had once been.', '', 'Born Sylvester Stewart in Texas in 1943, Stone started making music with his siblings as a child: The Stewart Four (Sylvester, his sisters Rose and Vaetta, and his brother Freddie) made their first single, “On the Battlefield,” in 1952. He moved to California with his family as a kid, and later became a familiar voice in the Bay Area’s music scene. As a staff producer at Autumn Records, he put together hits like Bobby Freeman’s “C’mon and Swim”; he also produced “Somebody to Love” by Grace Slick’s pre-Jefferson Airplane band, the Great Society. He was also a DJ on KSOL and KDIA, and later noted that “in radio, I found out about a lot of things I don’t like. Like, I think there shoudn’t be ‘Black radio.’ Just radio. Everybody be a part of everything.”', '', 'Stone’s own band, Sly & the Family Stone, came together over the course of 1966 and 1967. It really was a family of sorts: Sly and his siblings Rose and Freddie were joined by cousins Greg Errico and Jerry Martini, as well as bassist Larry Graham and trumpeter Cynthia Robinson. The Family Stone’s breakthrough hit was 1968’s “Dance to the Music,” in which their voices and instruments, high and low, each took a turn in the spotlight. A racially mixed band with male and female members, playing soul-infused rock together was a rare sight at the time — a utopian vision of what pop music could be.', 'Hits like “Life,” “Stand!,” “Everyday People,” and “Hot Fun in the Summertime” followed: all anthems of solidarity and joy that acknowledged the pain and frustration of the times and encouraged their audiences to transcend it. Sly & the Family Stone’s soaring performance of “I Want to Take You Higher” at Woodstock in 1969 was a triumph of that era, and the band finished the decade with an enormous hit: “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” whose joyful funk masked the existential horror and lacerating sarcasm of its lyrics.', 'Their next album was supposed to be called The Incredible and Unpredictable Sly & the Family Stone — a sideways reference to Stone’s habit of blowing off gigs. He finally released his masterpiece, There’s a Riot Goin’ On, in late 1971. Recorded with help from Bobby Womack and an early drum machine, it was a bleak, scarred, wobbly vision — the soured remains of the Sixties dream. “I think that’s kind of his like, help the medicine go down approach,” Questlove told Rolling Stone in March. “He paints a very dark, lyric, paranoia, self-confessional thing almost in every record, but it’s so happy-sounding.”', '', 'The Family Stone disintegrated over the next few years, as Sly sank deep into drug abuse and became even more erratic. He married Kathy Silva on stage in front of a crowd of 20,000 at a sold-out Madison Square Garden show in 1974, but within months, the band had broken up, and the marriage, which produced a son, Sylvester Jr., didn’t last much longer. “He beat me, held me captive, and wanted me to be in ménages à trois,” Silva said years later. “I didn’t want that world of drugs and weirdness.” Sylvia left in 1976. Sly had two more children, Sylvette and Novena Carmel. ', 'Sly persevered, making one attempt after another to win back the public: His 1976 album was called Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back, and the one that followed it three years later Back on the Right Track. After 1982’s half-finished Ain’t But the One Way, he never released another album of new, original material, despite persistent rumors that he was working on the magical record that would get his career back on its feet. He collaborated with George Clinton, on whom he’d been a huge influence; he turned up for guest vocals on records by the Bar-Kays and Earth, Wind and Fire.', '', 'Stone’s personal troubles continued. He was arrested for cocaine possession multiple times in the 1980s, and he served 14 months in a rehab center beginning in 1989. Between Sly & the Family Stone’s 1993 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the 2006 tribute to them at the Grammy Awards (for which Sly appeared for a few minutes with an enormous blond mohawk, then wandered off), he all but vanished. Interviewed by Vanity Fair in 2007, he claimed he had “a library” of new material, “a hundred and some songs, or maybe 200.” In 2011, the New York Post reported that he was living in a camper van in Los Angeles; that same year, he released I’m Back! Family & Friends, mostly lackluster new rerecordings of his Sixties classics.', 'But the specter of his glory years remained. Stone’s great 1960s and early-Seventies records inspired Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock to incorporate electric instruments and funk grooves into jazz; Prince and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Roots have all covered Sly & the Family Stone songs.', 'A little over a year after the release of Stone’s autobiography, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), a documentary, 2025’s Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius), reexamined Stone’s legacy. The film, directed by Questlove, focused on how Stone’s legacy and influence continues to reverberate through popular music along with how Stone carried the weight of that influence personally until it became a burden.', '“My intent was always to use Sly Stone to tell our story, my story, D’Angelo’s story, Lauryn Hill’s story, Frank Ocean’s story,” Questlove told Rolling Stone. “When you’re talking about ‘blowing it,’ a lot of times the fear of failing or the fear of returning to where you came from — which is the very bottom — causes you anxiety about your future, and then causes you to fumble it.”', '', 'The film featured commentary from George Clinton, Chaka Khan, D’Angelo, Q-Tip, and Family Stone members Larry Graham and Jerry Martini, among several others.', '“I feel like a piece of my heart left with Sly. We were best friends for 60 years. He credits me with starting the band, but it was his musical genius that made music history,” Martini said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “He will always be in my heart and I will continue to celebrate his music with the Family Stone. We extend our sincere love, condolences and prayers to his children and his family. Rest well my dear friend. You will be greatly missed.”', 'We want to hear it.

Thank you, Sly Stone, for being so generous with your music before your death on Monday at the age of 82 — for the wealth of durable hits that includes “Stand!,” “Sing a Simple Song,” “Everyday People,” “Dance to the Music,” “Family Affair,” and, yes, “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again).”', 'Thank you, Sly, for effectively inventing 1970s funk and the career of Prince with that last song. Thank you, Sly for pulling together the Family Stone, a band of players and singers Black and white, male and female, that served as a music-world version of the original Sesame Street cast, bright with the 1960s promise of a multicultural future unbound by racial or genre distinctions.', '', 'And thank you, Sly, falettin me into your life in 2007. Permit me to explain.', 'I grew up besotted with the music of the man born Sylvester Stewart in 1943. His songs defined my primordial years, osmosing straight into my bloodstream. In 1996, the year I became a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, I screwed up the courage to pitch the editor, Graydon Carter, the idea of my profiling Sly. Mr. Stone was in a bad place then. Actually, no one seemed quite sure what place he was in, having removed himself from public life after a bad 70s and 80s in which drugs and indolence robbed him of his joy and spark.', 'It wasn’t typical Vanity Fair material. But to my delight, Graydon said yes. Terrific! I started making phone calls. I got in touch with Greg Errico, the Family Stone’s founding drummer, who invited me to watch him jam in a Bay Area rehearsal space with fellow original band members Freddie Stone (guitar, Sly’s brother) and Jerry Martini (saxophone). Stonewalled by Sly’s then manager, Jerry Goldstein, I reached out to his fellow record-industry machers Lou Adler and Richard Gottehrer, to advocate on my behalf. Despite their efforts, Goldstein was unmoved.', '', 'Years passed. My wife and I welcomed two children into our family. A new millennium dawned. Then, early in 2007, I heard that the youngest of Sly’s sisters, a singer born Vaetta and known as Vet, had coaxed Sly into performing a few dates with her band that coming summer. I contacted Vet and related to her my decade-plus of travails. She told me that if I was serious, I should get to Las Vegas pronto to see her band’s show at the Flamingo Hotel. Sly, she said, was going to play. I asked her, given the predilection for no-shows that did in his career as a touring musician, if she was sure.', '“All I can say is that I’m his little sister and he’s never lied to me,” she said.', 'Sly did show up — in a bizarre ensemble pulled from the Me Decade’s dress-up bin, wearing platform boots, wraparound white sunglasses, and spangly newsboy knickers. It was a chaotic show in which he performed only a few songs. But when he sang a soft, unplugged version of “Stand!,” with its affirming message In the end you’ll still be you/ One that’s done all the things you set out to do, he held the crowd rapt. It was evident that, whatever he had done to himself bodily and mentally, his voice and musicianship were intact.', 'My reward for turning up was the first major interview he had granted in a couple of decades. We met in a motorcycle shop in his native Vallejo, California, called Chopper Guys Biker Products. I had a million questions. He answered them gnomically. When I asked him what he had been up to all these years, and if he was watching Seinfeld and American Idol like the rest of us, he said, “I’ve done all that. I do regular things a lot. But it’s probably more of a Sly Stone life. It’s probably… it’s probably not very normal.”', '', 'The comeback that my Vanity Fair profile was meant to signal failed to materialize; he still had drug and business issues to sort out. But between then and now, he did finally get sober. Vet emailed me a photo of Sly contentedly dandling a grandson in his lap. In Questlove’s excellent documentary released earlier this year, Sly Lives! (a.k.a. The Burden of Black Genius), his younger daughter, Novena, laughs at the unlikely circumstance to which she now regularly bears witness: “He’s kind of just like… a standard old Black man.”', 'That he lived to become that is hope-giving. Sly is often upheld as as an avatar for how the utopianism of 1960s America curdled into solipsism, cynicism, and bad vibes. I am reminded of the title character’s reproach of the Dude in The Big Lebowski: “Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski. Condolences. The bums lost!”', 'But in the long run, Sly won. He found redemptive happiness. His library of music remains as alive and vibrant as ever and shall forever transcend the circumstances of its making and what came after.

The musical icon had been battling lung disease, according to a statement provided by his family. He was 82.', '""While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come,"" the statement reads.', 'Born Sylvester Stewart, the second of five children, he and his family moved from Denton, Texas to Vallejo, Calif. when he was an adolescent. The family was heavily involved in the Church of God In Christ.', 'By age 8, Stone was recording gospel music with his siblings, Freddie, Rose and Vaetta as The Stewart Four. You can hear Stone as a child belting out ""On the Battlefield of the Lord"" on a single they recorded in 1952.', 'He was still in grade school when a friend misspelled ""Sylvester"" as ""Sly."" The nickname stuck. By age 11, Stone became proficient in keyboards, guitar, bass, and drums. In high school, he\'d formed a multi-racial doo-wop group, The Viscaynes, which recorded some singles in Los Angeles.', 'As a young man, Stone was a successful disc jockey for KSOL, an R&B radio station in San Mateo, Calif. His playlists included popular records by white artists such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.', 'During this time Stone also worked as a record producer for Autumn Records, producing San Francisco-area bands. One of the Stone-produced singles was Bobby Freeman\'s ""C\'mon and Swim,"" which reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop chart in 1964.', 'Stone and his brother Freddie merged their own bands together in 1966 to form Sly & the Family Stone. In it, women — notably — were not just vocalists but also played instruments, a rarity for the era. And it included both Black and white musicians. Within a few years, the group was turning out hits such as ""Everyday People,"" ""Family Affair"" and ""Dance to the Music.""', 'Although the group attracted a large and diverse audience from its beginnings, Stone was pressured by the Black Panthers to kick the white members out of the group — sometimes menacingly and in person, as saxophone player Jerry Martini recalled in a 2013 interview with NPR.', '""Sly always, always stood up for me, and in many instances, he saved my butt,"" Martini said.', ""Sly & the Family Stone's sound was a dazzling fusion of psychedelic rock, soul, jazz, gospel and Latin. The group's early morning performance at Woodstock in 1969 was widely recognized as a legendary moment in a legendary concert."", '""The call, the response. It felt like church,"" Stone wrote in his 2023 memoir Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin). ""The horns went up into the sky. When the show was over, we were wet and cold. I don\'t remember how I left, maybe the same way I came in, but I wasn\'t there to see Jimi [Hendrix] close the festival.""', '""We knew something magical was happening. I think after we realized that it was a sea of people in front of us,"" Sly\'s sister, Rose Stone, told NPR in 2007. ""It was about 5:00 AM when we went on. It was dark, and we were playing our best ... and the sun started to come up and all of a sudden all we could see was just a sea of people. I think it was like an apex of our group.""', ""In the 1970s, Sly Stone's music got gloomier and more cynical, reflecting a world made bleak by the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President John F. Kennedy, as well as elevated racial tensions and the horrors of the Vietnam War."", ""After playing some of the most euphoric and politically charged music that defined a generation, Sly and the Family Stone dissolved, in part, because of Stone's well-documented drug abuse. He became infamous for ghosting his own shows."", 'By the 1980s, Sly Stone had slipped into seclusion. He was arrested for cocaine possession in 2011. But in the mid 2000s, he started to make sporadic public appearances, including performing with his daughter\'s band, Baby Stone. The Grammys gave him a lifetime achievement award in 2017. His memoir, wrote Associated Press reviewer Christopher Weber, ""overflows with wit and wordplay.""

But the music he created with the band − a lineup that included brother/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini and bassist Larry Graham − inhabits the music of artists ranging from Diana Ross & The Supremes to Michael Jackson to John Mayer.', 'Sly and the Family Stone released 10 studio albums between 1967 and 1982, with many songs injected with passionate social consciousness and others existing as blissful foot-stompers.', ""Here are five of the band's most essential songs:"", 'The first No. 1 hit for the unit is also one of the most enduring in music history. A call for peace and equality is blanketed with a pop sheen including a singsong chorus (""There is a blue one who can\'t accept the green one for living with the black one trying to be a skinny one"") and a bridge including the phrase, ""different strokes for different folks,"" which was the inspiration behind the \'70s sitcom ""Diff\'rent Strokes."" The song\'s covers include a memorable rendition by Joan Jett as well as Cher and Future, who recorded it for a 2017 Gap commercial.', 'Sly Stone wrote this minor, yet important, hit solo and also primarily used studio musicians to record it. Stone\'s message was simple, to stand ""for the things you know are right,"" his words emphasized by a gospel choir. ""It\'s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight. … Don\'t you know that you are free, at least in your mind if you want to be,"" he sings in a gravelly tone before a mid-song detour into a think stew of gospel and funk. The B-side of the single – ""I Want to Take You Higher"" – is equally worthy of hosannas.', ""Though it was released just before the band’s appearance at Woodstock, the No. 2 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 became a symbol of the music festival with its memo about carefree fun in the sun. Tapped piano notes and a gentle pillow of strings provide the song’s backbone, and when the horns kick in along with the group's soaring background vocals, it's impossible not to get swept into the groovy vibe."", 'Though the spelling of the title would cause much cringing among English teachers, the clever title (which translates to ""Thank You for Letting Me Be Myself Again"") is one of many unforgettable elements of the funktastic singalong of individuality that still serves as a call to the dance floor.', 'A sliding high hat pairs with heavy use of bassist Graham\'s legendary ""slap technique,"" which he would employ throughout the band’s duration and be emulated by Prince, Flea and Chic\'s Bernard Edwards, among others.', 'The final No. 1 hit for the band and one of its most emulated, whether through its woozy electric piano (played by Billy Preston) or its syncopated rhythm. Prince and Madonna found ways to interpolate the song into their own recordings (""Y Should Eye Do That When Eye Can Do This?"" and ""Keep It Together,"" respectively), but, no, Mary J.

"Sly Stone, funk-rock progenitor and leader of the Family Stone, dies at 82",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-06-09/sly-stone-dies-at-82,"['Sly Stone, a funk pioneer whose influence and impact as leader of the musical group Sly and the Family Stone was as enduring as his career was brief, died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 82.', 'An agent of change before he vanished from the public eye, Stone died “after a prolonged battle with COPD and other underlying health issues,” according to a statement from his family.', 'From his beginnings in a family gospel group and his time as a lively San Francisco DJ, Stone became one of the major innovators in R&B, rock and pop music. There was a keen curiosity, even a restlessness, in the way he kept changing his group’s sound during its short, spectacular stint at the top.', 'Stone had a capacity for summing up the zeitgeist of an America in social transition, from collective joy (“Dance to the Music”) to racial harmony (“Everyday People”), and from the search for transcendence (“I Want To Take You Higher”) to the broken idealism in which the 1960s ended (“Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey”), a timeline in which he created a template for future generations of funk-rock hybrids.', 'After a musical peak that lasted six years, Stone released a few inconsequential records, spent decades mired in addictions to cocaine and sedatives, was arrested for possession of crack and lived in a camper van, a husk of his younger, vibrant self.', 'But several recent documentaries and Stone’s 2023 memoir “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” made a renewed case for the relevance of his bountiful vision, even amidst a tragic life.', '“When Sly comes on stage, you see older people looking like, ‘What’s this?,’ and younger people losing their minds,” said Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the director of “Summer of Soul” and “Sly Lives! (Aka The Burden Of Black Genius),” in an interview with the Times in 2021. “It’s an absolute lesson in how transformative they were.”', 'Stone formed Sly and the Family Stone in 1966, bringing in his brother Freddie (guitar) and sister Rose (piano). Stone played keyboards, guitar, bass and drums and wrote, arranged and produced all of the group’s music. The great funk bassist Bootsy Collins once called Stone “the most talented musician I know.”', 'Sly conceived of the Family Stone as a rainbow coalition of soul, with male and female, white and Black members. Traditional R&B was entering an expansive, transformative phase, which Stone accelerated with his innovations in funk, rock and psychedelia, not to mention fashion: He came to one interview, a reporter noted, in “knee-high fox fur boots, cut velvet knickers and a red satin shirt with 20-inch fringe on the sleeves.”', 'Between 1967 and 1973, Sly and the Family Stone had nine singles in the Top 40. “Dance to the Music,” the exuberant title song to their second album, hit No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. The hits that followed included three No. 1 songs — “Everyday People,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)” and “Family Affair” — as well as a No. 2, “Hot Fun in the Summertime.”', 'The mass of musicians he influenced ranges from Miles Davis to Janet Jackson, Herbie Hancock to Ice-T. “Everyday People” alone was covered by Aretha Franklin, Joan Jett, the Staples Singers, the Supremes and Pearl Jam, and it was interpolated by Arrested Development on the 1992 hit “People Everyday.” John Legend won a Grammy in 2007 for his cover of “Family Affair.” Prince, who was lavish in his praise of Stone, hired the Family Stone’s horn section to tour with him in 1997.', 'The group achieved perhaps their greatest renown in August 1969, when they landed a prestigious second-day gig at the Woodstock music festival, playing after Janis Joplin and before the Who.', 'Like many groups that weekend, they had equipment problems during the set, but resolved them with a bang-up 20-minute medley of “Everyday People” and “Dance to the Music.” “The delirium peaked during Sly & the Family Stone’s set,” journalist Ellen Sander wrote in the liner notes of the 2019 box set “Woodstock — Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive.”', 'MUSIC', '', 'In his occasional interviews, Stone made it clear that he was what, at the time, was called a race man. “Everybody in our group is neutral about race,” he told the New York Times in 1970. “Everybody in the group knows that Blacks have been screwed over by whites — that most whites are prejudiced.”', 'The band moved to L.A. not long after Woodstock, and quickly found trouble. The Black Panthers lobbied Stone to replace the two white band members with Black musicians. Some band members were doing cocaine and PCP. “It was havoc. It was very gangsterish, dangerous. The vibes were very dark at that point,” Family Stone saxophonist Jerry Martini told author Joel Selvin. Their concerts routinely started hours late, or never started at all.', 'When the group returned in 1971 with “There’s a Riot Goin’ On” (the title was a reply to Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On”), the exuberance of their music had curdled. The songs had a flinty exterior and a troubled tone. Stone wove drum machines into the dense thickets of sound. The cover showed a red, white and black American flag; “Africa Talks to You” was torpid — funk without any swing. The tone is bleak, dissonant, even static.', 'Years later, “There’s a Riot Goin’ On” was recognized as a prophetic record, one of only a few that described the end of the 1960s’ idealism. It was the last significant music Stone released.', 'Sylvester Stewart was born March 15, 1944, in Denton, Texas. When he was 3 months old, his parents, K.C. and Alpha Stewart, moved the family to Vallejo, in the Bay Area. The family sang gospel music and were active in the Church of God in Christ, where K.C. was a deacon. “I thought everybody in the world played music,” Stone later said.', 'While still a youth, Stone cut his first record, a gospel 78 RPM disc with brother Freddie and sisters Rose and Vaetta, as the Stewart Four. A fifth-grade classmate misspelled Sylvester’s name on the school chalkboard, and the mistake turned into a prophetic nickname: Sly.', 'Before he reached puberty, Stone had mastered several musical instruments. In his teens, he recorded sporadically with various doo-wop and R&B groups. He studied music theory at Vallejo Junior College, then attended the Chris Borden School of Modern Broadcasting. In 1964, he got a job at the R&B station KSOL, where he brought the Beatles and Rolling Stones into the station’s playlist and showed off his slick patter. The station christened him Sly Sloan, but he hated the name, so he introduced himself to listeners as Sly Stone — a taste of stubbornness to come.', 'By 1966, after playing music in fits and starts, Stone had formed a new band by plucking the best musicians from his band, Sly and the Stoners, and his brother Freddie’s band, which included drummer Gregg Errico and saxophonist Jerry Martini. The brothers Stone enlisted bass guitar wonder Larry Graham, who’d been playing in a local jazz duo with his mother.', 'Their first album, “A Whole New Thing,” didn’t chart. Clive Davis, the president of CBS Records, who oversaw Epic, advised Stone to try for a more commercial sound. His first attempt was a bull’s-eye: “Dance to the Music,” a shared-vocal funk workout on which Graham begins to introduce his influential “thumping and plucking” style of bass, and trumpeter Cynthia Robinson warns, “All the squares, go home!”', 'The group’s third album, “Life,” was another dud, though it included top tracks “Life” and “M’Lady.” Soon after it disappeared, Stone recorded “Everyday People,” a jolly song about tolerance that featured an unusual one-note bassline by Graham, and popularized the phrase “different strokes for different folks.” In addition to “Everyday People,” 1969’s “Stand!” included the title track, “Sing a Simple Song,” “I Want to Take You Higher,” “You Can Make It If You Try.” and the playful but pointed six-minute track “Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey,” which used a vocoder, delay and distortion to create a menacing artificiality that caught on quickly with Parliament-Funkadelic and was revived by T-Pain.', 'Stone described the band’s fifth album, 1971’s ominous “There’s a Riot Goin’ On,” as “a very truthful album, made and then released at a very truthful moment in time. That’s what it was all about, because I know the truth always prevails. And that’s exactly what my music is all about.”', 'But there were other truths, particularly about drug addiction that Stone tried to keep hidden. Band members quit: first Errico, then Graham (who founded the funk act Graham Central Station), and later, Freddie Stone and Martini.', '“Fresh,” in 1973, included the band’s final top-20 chart song, “If You Want Me to Stay.” Producer Brian Eno cited “Fresh” as the pivotal and irreversible production moment when “the rhythm instruments, particularly the bass drum and bass, suddenly become the important instruments in the mix.” `”Small Talk,” the following year, had a minor hit, “Time for Livin’,” and a cover photo of Sly, wife Kathy Silva (a Hawaiian actress whom he married onstage at Madison Square Garden) and their young son, Sylvester Jr.', 'The smiling family photo was deceptive, however. “He beat me, held me captive and wanted me to be in ménages à trois,” Silva later told People magazine. “I didn’t want that world of drugs and weirdness.” She left him in 1976 when his pit bull mauled Sylvester Jr., who was 2 at the time. Stone also had a daughter, Sylvette Phunne Robinson, with Family Stone trumpeter Robinson, and a second daughter, Novena Carmel, now a host for KCRW’s “Morning Becomes Eclectic” program.', 'Sly and the Family Stone’s next two albums, “High on You” and “Heard You Missed Me, Well I’m Back,” sold poorly. “Back on the Right Track,” in 1979, defied its hopeful title. There was another album in 1983. The adjective “reclusive” became permanently attached to his name.', 'Rumors persistently popped up, fostered by his absence: He’d recorded new songs, he’d worked with Prince, he had 100 new songs — no, 200 — he was on the verge of a comeback, always on the verge of it. He was convicted on charges of possessing cocaine in 1987. Two years later, he was arrested by FBI agents on a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution on the charges. He was arrested again for cocaine possession in 2011, after which he claimed he’d been to rehab seven times.', 'When Sly and the Family Stone were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, Stone stepped to the microphone, said, “See you soon,” and split. It was years before the public saw him again.', 'The Grammys paid tribute to Stone in 2006. After a medley of his hits, sung by John Legend, will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, among others, Stone came onstage in a white mohawk, sunglasses and a metallic duster, with a cast on his right hand. He hunched over a keyboard, sang a bit of “I Want to Take You Higher” in a distracted manner, seemed to miss a few cues and walked off before the song was over.', 'He was booked to play Coachella in 2010, shortly after he was reported to be homeless, but he played “an abysmal, confused set,” the Guardian said. Stone came on stage 3½ hours late, and when he talked, he either mumbled or stopped in the middle of sentences. He said he’d been kidnapped and cheated by managers. He started songs, held on for a few bars, then drifted away. “To say that he seemed high was an understatement,” a New Yorker writer observed. The L.A. Weekly called it a “sad spectacle.”', 'Rarely had a great music artist suffered such a severe, rapid and irreversible downfall. People struggled to explain it.', '“He’s had problems because he hasn’t been able to grow up,” Sylvester Stewart Jr., his son, said in 1996, after Stone finished a 45-day stay in rehab. “He’s meant no harm to anyone.”', '“Sly never grew out of drugs,” his ex-wife, Silva, said. “He lost his backbone and destroyed his future.”', 'Still, the story of his musical exuberance and deep personal pain continued to inspire — and haunt — the inheritors of his vision. With his pair of documentaries, director and musician Questlove used Stone’s life story to probe weighty questions about Black genius and how it’s embraced, exploited and neglected by the culture. The power of Stone’s music is bound up in his private pain.', '“Soul music is releasing a demon that turns into a beautiful, cathartic exercise,” Questlove told the Times in 2025. “We never just see it as ‘I’m watching someone go through therapy.’', '“Only time will tell,” he said, “if I had to make the Sly story to save my own life.”', 'His 2023 memoir, largely a study of his early life and craft, alluded to the toll that his drug use took on his output. “I should have stopped sooner,” he wrote. “Much sooner: less dust and powder, fewer rocks and pipes, enough days given back that might have added up to years.”', 'In the last years of his life, Stone worked on sobriety and lived quietly in the San Fernando Valley. His family, including brother Freddie, were left to speak up for Sly.', '“When people ask me questions about what was going on behind the scenes and how did you make such great music, I tell them it was Sly writing what was coming out of his heart and soul,” he told the website Wax Poetics. “He is a true genius.”', 'Times staff writer August Brown contributed to this report.', 'The biggest entertainment stories', 'Get our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', 'BOOKS', 'ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS', 'MUSIC', 'MUSIC', 'Subscribe for unlimited access\nSite Map', 'Follow Us', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

The federal funding that supports local stations and public media is under threat.', '', 'Hillel Italie, Associated Press', 'Leave your feedback', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Sly Stone, the revolutionary musician and dynamic showman whose Sly and the Family Stone transformed popular music in the 1960s and ’70s and beyond with such hits as “Everyday People,” “Stand!” and “Family Affair,” has died. He was 82.', 'Stone, born Sylvester Stewart, had been in poor health in recent years. His publicist Carleen Donovan said Monday that Stone died in Los Angeles surrounded by family after contending with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments.', 'Formed in 1966-67, Sly and the Family Stone was the first major group to include Black and white men and women, and well embodied a time when anything seemed possible — riots and assassinations, communes and love-ins. The singers screeched, chanted, crooned and hollered. The music was a blowout of frantic horns, rapid-fire guitar and locomotive rhythms, a melting pot of jazz, psychedelic rock, doo-wop, soul and the early grooves of funk.', 'Sly’s time on top was brief, roughly from 1968-1971, but profound. No band better captured the gravity-defying euphoria of the Woodstock era or more bravely addressed the crash which followed. From early songs as rousing as their titles — “I Want To Take You Higher,” “Stand!” — to the sober aftermath of “Family Affair” and “Runnin’ Away,” Sly and the Family Stone spoke for a generation whether or not it liked what they had to say.', 'Stone’s group began as a Bay Area sextet featuring Sly on keyboards, Larry Graham on bass; Sly’s brother, Freddie, on guitar; sister Rose on vocals; Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini horns and Greg Errico on drums. They debuted with the album “A Whole New Thing” and earned the title with their breakthrough single, “Dance to the Music.” It hit the top 10 in April 1968, the week the Rev. Martin Luther King was murdered, and helped launch an era when the polish of Motown and the understatement of Stax suddenly seemed of another time.', 'Sly & the Family Stone performs on the TV show “The Midnight Special” in 1971 in Burbank, California. Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images', 'Led by Sly Stone, with his leather jumpsuits and goggle shades, mile-wide grin and mile-high Afro, the band dazzled in 1969 at the Woodstock festival and set a new pace on the radio. “Everyday People,” “I Wanna Take You Higher” and other songs were anthems of community, non-conformity and a brash and hopeful spirit, built around such catchphrases as “different strokes for different folks.” The group released five top 10 singles, three of them hitting No. 1, and three million-selling albums: “Stand!”, “There’s a Riot Goin’ On” and “Greatest Hits.”', 'For a time, countless performers wanted to look and sound like Sly and the Family Stone. The Jackson Five’s breakthrough hit, “I Want You Back” and the Temptations’ “I Can’t Get Next to You” were among the many songs from the late 1960s that mimicked Sly’s vocal and instrumental arrangements. Miles Davis’ landmark blend of jazz, rock and funk, “Bitches Brew,” was inspired in part by Sly, while fellow jazz artist Herbie Hancock even named a song after him.', '“He had a way of talking, moving from playful to earnest at will. He had a look, belts, and hats and jewelry,” Questlove wrote in the foreword to Stone’s memoir, “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” named for one of his biggest hits and published through Questlove’s imprint in 2023. “He was a special case, cooler than everything around him by a factor of infinity.”', 'In 2025, Questlove released the documentary “Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).”', 'Sly’s influence has endured for decades. The top funk artist of the 1970s, Parliament-Funkadelic creator George Clinton, was a Stone disciple. Prince, Rick James and the Black-Eyed Peas were among the many performers from the 1980s and after influenced by Sly, and countless rap and hip-hop artists have sampled his riffs, from the Beastie Boys to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. A 2005 tribute record included Maroon 5, John Legend and the Roots.', '“Sly did so many things so well that he turned my head all the way around,” Clinton once wrote. “He could create polished R&B that sounded like it came from an act that had gigged at clubs for years, and then in the next breath he could be as psychedelic as the heaviest rock band.”', 'By the early ’70s, Stone himself was beginning a descent from which he never recovered, driven by the pressures of fame and the added burden of Black fame. His record company was anxious for more hits, while the Black Panthers were pressing him to drop the white members from his group. After moving from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in 1970, he became increasingly hooked on cocaine and erratic in his behavior. A promised album, “The Incredible and Unpredictable Sly and the Family Stone” (“The most optimistic of all,” Rolling Stone reported) never appeared. He became notorious for being late to concerts or not showing up at all, often leaving “other band members waiting backstage for hours wondering whether he was going to show up or not,” according to Stone biographer Joel Selvin.', 'Around the country, separatism and paranoia were setting in. As a turn of the calendar, and as a state of mind, the ’60s were over. “The possibility of possibility was leaking out,” Stone later explained in his memoir.', 'On “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” Stone had warned: “Dying young is hard to take/selling out is harder.” Late in 1971, he released “There’s a Riot Going On,” one of the grimmest, most uncompromising records ever to top the album charts. The sound was dense and murky (Sly was among the first musicians to use drum machines), the mood reflective (“Family Affair”), fearful (“Runnin’ Away”) and despairing: “Time, they say, is the answer — but I don’t believe it,” Sly sings on “Time.” The fast, funky pace of the original “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” was slowed, stretched and retitled “Thank You For Talkin’ to Me, Africa.”', 'The running time of the title track was 0:00.', '“It is Muzak with its finger on the trigger,” critic Greil Marcus called the album.', '“Riot” highlighted an extraordinary run of blunt, hard-hitting records by Black artists, from the Stevie Wonder single “Superstition” to Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On” album, to which “Riot” was an unofficial response. But Stone seemed to back away from the nightmare he had related. He was reluctant to perform material from “Riot” in concert and softened the mood on the acclaimed 1973 album “Fresh,” which did feature a cover of “Que Sera Sera,” the wistful Doris Day song reworked into a rueful testament to fate’s upper hand.', 'By the end of the decade, Sly and the Family Stone had broken up and Sly was releasing solo records with such unmet promises as “Heard You Missed Me, Well I’m Back” and “Back On the Right Track.” Most of the news he made over the following decades was of drug busts, financial troubles and mishaps on stage. Sly and the Family Stone was inducted into the Rock & Roll of Fame in 1993 and honored in 2006 at the Grammy Awards, but Sly released just one album after the early ’80s, “I’m Back! Family & Friends,” much of it updated recordings of his old hits.', 'He would allege he had hundreds of unreleased songs and did collaborate on occasion with Clinton, who would recall how Stone “could just be sitting there doing nothing and then open his eyes and shock you with a lyric so brilliant that it was obvious no one had ever thought of it before.”', 'Sly Stone had three children, including a daughter with Cynthia Robinson, and was married once — briefly and very publicly. In 1974, he and actor Kathy Silva wed on stage at Madison Square Garden, an event that inspired an 11,000-word story in The New Yorker. Sly and Silva soon divorced.', 'He was born Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, and raised in Vallejo, California, the second of five children in a close, religious family. Sylvester became “Sly” by accident, when a teacher mistakenly spelled his name “Slyvester.”', 'He loved performing so much that his mother alleged he would cry if the congregation in church didn’t respond when he sang before it. He was so gifted and ambitious that by age 4 he had sung on stage at a Sam Cooke show and by age 11 had mastered several instruments and recorded a gospel song with his siblings. He was so committed to the races working together that in his teens and early 20s he was playing in local bands that included Black and white members and was becoming known around the Bay Area as a deejay equally willing to play the Beatles and rhythm and blues acts.', 'Through his radio connections, he produced some of the top San Francisco bands, including the Great Society, Grace Slick’s group before she joined the Jefferson Airplane. Along with an early mentor and champion, San Francisco deejay Tom “Big Daddy” Donahue, he worked on rhythm and blues hits (Bobby Freeman’s “C’mon and Swim”) and the Beau Brummels’ Beatle-esque “Laugh, Laugh.” Meanwhile, he was putting together his own group, recruiting family members and local musicians and settling on the name Sly and the Family Stone.', '“A Whole New Thing” came out in 1967, soon followed by the single “Dance to the Music,” in which each member was granted a moment of introduction as the song rightly proclaimed a “brand new beat.” In December 1968, the group appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and performed a medley that included “Dance to the Music” and “Everyday People.” Before the set began, Sly turned to the audience and recited a brief passage from his song “Are You Ready”:', '“Don’t hate the Black,', 'don’t hate the white,', 'if you get bitten,', 'just hate the bite.”', 'Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.', 'Left: Musician Sly Stone of the psychedelic soul group Sly And The Family Stone performs at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Bethel, New York.

The 1971 album There’s a Riot Goin’ On, a moody reflection on civil rights and the corrupted idealism of the postwar era created predominantly by Stone apart from the rest of his band, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of the 20th century.', 'Born Sylvester Stewart to a Pentecostal religious family in Texas in 1943, Stone grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. His first music came in a gospel quartet with three siblings, the Stewart Four, who put out a locally released single in 1952.', 'As a young man he became well known in the fertile musical scene of countercultural San Francisco: a multi-instrumentalist and radio DJ who had a series of local bands and worked as a producer for garage rock and psychedelia groups such as the Beau Brummels.', 'In 1966, he fused his band Sly and the Stoners with his brother Freddie’s group Freddie and the Stone Souls, to form Sly and the Family Stone. Their breakthrough came the following year with Dance to the Music, and success was fully established by their fourth album in two years, Stand! (1969), which eventually sold more than three million copies. The band’s stylistic and racial diversity attracted a broad audience, and they played both of the defining music festivals of 1969, Woodstock and the Harlem cultural festival.', 'Hits continued more fitfully during the early 1970s, and the group – notorious for no-shows at concerts – slowly fractured amid increasing drug use. Stone would record There’s a Riot Goin’ On predominantly on his own, applying one of the earliest uses of a drum machine; albums such as Fresh!, with its Richard Avedon portrait of Stone on the cover, were also primarily his work. The band split entirely in 1975, though Stone continued to use the band name for solo releases.', 'Despite having laid the rhythmic groundwork for disco, Stone couldn’t sustain his career in the late 1970s, and his addiction to cocaine worsened. He continued to perform with peers such as Funkadelic and Bobby Womack, but album releases dried up after 1982’s Ain’t But the One Way.', 'He was arrested in 1983 for cocaine possession, and for driving under the influence of cocaine in 1987, prompting him to flee California for Connecticut. He was apprehended two years later, and sentenced to 55 days in prison, five years’ probation and a fine. His difficulties meant that he was little seen during the 1990s, and it wasn’t until 2006 that he performed in public again, at a tribute to Sly and the Family Stone at the Grammy awards.', 'He performed with the Family Stone on a tour the following year, but often erratically, and made a lacklustre appearance at 2010’s Coachella festival. His final album, I’m Back! Family & Friends, featuring re-recordings of old songs alongside three new tracks, was released in 2011.', 'In 2015 he was awarded $5m in a lawsuit against his former manager and attorney, successfully arguing that royalty payments had been diverted from him, though he ultimately wasn’t awarded the money due to the terms of a 1989 royalties agreement with a production company. Difficulties with royalties meant that Stone spent many of his latter years in poverty; in 2011 he was living in a campervan in a residential area of Los Angeles – voluntarily, he claimed – and relying on a retired couple for food.', '“Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,” the family statement added. “His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable. In a testament to his enduring creative spirit, Sly recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course, which follows a memoir published in 2024.”', 'That memoir, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), was praised in a Guardian review: “The charm, playfulness, humour and personality of Stone’s songs come through in his on-page voice”.', 'In a 2023 interview with the Guardian accompanying its publication, he said: “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own. I’m proud that the music I made inspired people.”', 'Among those paying tribute to Stone was musician Questlove, whose documentary about Stone, Sly Lives!, was release earliest this year. “From the moment his music reached me in the early 1970s, it became a part of my soul,” he wrote on Instagram. “Sly was a giant — not just for his groundbreaking work with the Family Stone, but for the radical inclusivity and deep human truths he poured into every note … His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.”', 'Musician and actor Queen Latifah heralded Stone as an “innovator [and] funk aficionado”, while hip-hop icon DJ Premier wrote: “I thank you for bringing us diversity, funk, soul, rock and a unique band which is why I’m cut from the integrity cloth. I will remain great because of you.” Waterboys frontman Mike Scott wrote: “Thank you for all the inspiration, for breaking ground so others could follow and for being the sassiest, funkiest being on planet earth”.', 'Stone was married from 1974 to 1976 to Kathy Silva, with whom he had a son, Sylvester Jr. He later had two further children: Sylvyette with Cynthia Robinson, and Novena Carmel.']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

He was the second oldest of five siblings and began his first band — the Stewart Four — with his brother Freddie and his sisters Rose and Loretta, which put out their only record in 1956 when Stone was still a teenager. Freddie and Rose, along with their younger sister Vet, eventually joined the Family Stone, the first integrated rock band, in 1966. Their first album, 1967’s A Whole New Thing, was not a commercial success but led to 1968’s Dance to the Music, which produced a top-ten hit of the same name. Their first number-one single was 1968’s political unification anthem “Everyday People,” off their album Stand! In 1969, they performed at Woodstock.

As bandleader of legendary rap group The Roots, he also shepherds their work as house band for NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. He’s produced artists ranging from D’Angelo to Elvis Costello. He’s performed as a DJ for the Academy Awards and at the White House. He’s got a podcast, Questlove Supreme, and had a web series, Quest for Craft. He’s written books, including a look at creativity called Creative Quest and 2024’s Hip-Hop Is History. He even served as an executive producer for CBS’s A Grammy Salute to 50 Years of Hip-Hop.', 'But back in the summer of 2020, he was contemplating saying no more often. That’s when he was editing Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) — an evocative and telling look at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival; the film went on to win the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.', 'Thompson remembers a rueful thought while looking at footage of Sly Stone’s performance from that festival — just before the funk and soul pioneer would play the much higher profile Woodstock festival and become a genre-bending star.', '“Sly doesn’t even know that, in exactly 10 days, his life is going to flip upside-down,” Questlove recalls thinking. “It’s going to be the most surreal three-year period in his life. And I said, ‘Man, somebody needs to do a documentary on that.’ I want to see the story of Sly Stone and what happens to him after Woodstock. Because it’s the craziest set of occurrences.”', 'Twenty-four hours later, the rapper and actor Common called with an idea. He owned Sly Stone’s life rights, had heard about Summer of Soul, and wanted to know if Thompson was interested in directing a documentary about Stone after he finished his current film.', 'Just like that, Questlove was saying yes one more time.', '“After [Summer of Soul debuted at Sundance], I guess that was the green-light indication that I might know what I’m doing with these music stories,” Thompson says, laughing.', '“And then, right after the Oscar, six offers came in, and the next thing I know I was like, ‘Yeah, I’ll take that.’ And now I’m stuck. It’s a good problem to have.”', 'One of those offers came in a similarly fortuitous way, when he was summoned to meet Saturday Night Live impresario Lorne Michaels in the show’s offices at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York.', '“I was thinking, ‘Wait, finally my dream’s coming true and you’re asking The Roots to be musical guests on the show?’” Thompson says. “Lorne just said, ‘You know, in about four years, it’s going to be the 50th anniversary of SNL. I love what you did with Summer of Soul; would you like to do this [documentary on SNL’s musical history]?’ And so, instant yes.”', ""That's how Thompson came to direct two of the biggest musical documentaries of early 2025, released within weeks of each other: Ladies & Gentlemen … 50 Years of SNL Music, streaming on Peacock, and Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius), available on Hulu and Disney+. Each offers a detailed, knowing look at its subject, with expert interviews, sharp ideas and storytelling styles that unfold like the world’s coolest club mix."", '“He’s worked on some of the most incredible records of all time. Of course, he’s a musical genius,” says Joseph Patel, who worked closely with Thompson as a producer on Summer of Soul and Sly Lives! “But he also has this desire to be a storyteller. He absorbs everything, but he’s still curious. We’re constantly chatting about theories that he has. He’s constantly trying to make sense of things.”', 'Patel says Thompson brings big ideas to help frame and shape the stories he wants to tell. “In our first conversation about Sly Lives!, he talked about this theory that Sly was the first Black artist who crossed over into the rock world and was heralded as a rock god by both Black and white audiences — and then didn’t have a blueprint to handle that.”', 'Sly Lives! explores the extreme pressure Stone felt to cope with Black and white audiences’ differing expectations, and how it led to self-destructive behavior: substance abuse, showing up late (or not at all) to concerts and more. The film features commentary from artists like D’Angelo and Chaka Khan, who faced similar struggles; though they’re ostensibly talking about Stone, they also seem to be addressing their own struggles.', '“We see [echoes of Stone’s] behavior in a lot of artists we admire and a lot of contemporaries of Ahmir’s,” Patel says. “He talked about his own struggles with success and the guilt that comes with that — survivor’s guilt. He talked about D’Angelo on the Voodoo tour [in 2000] and the pressure D’Angelo felt to take his shirt off at the end of the show to a screaming throng of fans, when he just wanted to play music. Ahmir was constantly thinking about that.”', '“When I would ask people [to speak in the film], their first response was, ‘Well, I don’t know that much about Sly, so I can’t do this,” Thompson says. “And I [would say], ‘Matter of fact, it’s better if you don’t talk about Sly. I’m not asking you questions about Sly. I’m asking questions about you.’ We would like to get in the mind-state of how an artist feels. I told them, ‘This could be very cathartic for you to talk about. Because oftentimes, fans don’t really care how you feel.’”', 'Thompson has spent a lifetime negotiating the pitfalls of an artist’s existence. Born and raised in Philadelphia, he cut his musical teeth touring with his father’s doo-wop group, Lee Andrews & the Hearts, filling in on drums at just 12 years of age. He met longtime creative partner Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts — where their classmates included future superstar jazz bassist Christian McBride and members of Boyz II Men — and the two formed a drummer-MC duo that evolved into The Roots in the early 1990s.', 'Though his love for pop culture, boundless creativity and herculean work ethic have led Thompson to everything from founding a book-publishing imprint to teaching at New York University, he admits that directing Summer of Soul provoked more than a few bouts of imposter syndrome. Eventually he realized the pandemic was forcing everyone in the film world to learn how to do things differently.', '“I found it very odd and apropos that a first-time director was learning in real time what the new normal was going to be for the rules of directing,” he says, recalling having to guide film crews remotely with his iPhone. “Anything you create, you have to just trust-fall into it and make sure you’re doing a project that is bringing you joy in your heart.”', ""Sly Lives! charts Stone's expansive, eclectic and pioneering career. Born Sylvester Stewart in Texas and raised in the Bay Area, he was — before his own chart-topping years — a renowned radio DJ in the early 1960s and later produced artists like The Beau Brummels for the San Francisco–based pop record label Autumn Records."", '“One point I wanted to make was that Sly is a major presence on radio for five years before he starts recording himself,” Thompson says. “He starts as a radio DJ in 1961, when the transistor radio has the same power as Spotify today. Those teenage kids with transistor radios in the Bay Area are eventually going to become the counterculture hippies, like Sly raises them.”', 'Eventually Stone formed Sly and the Family Stone with relatives and friends — breaking ground with a mixed-gender band rooted in Black music and featuring white and Black members. They charted a string of huge hits, from “Dance to the Music” (1967) and “Everyday People” (1968) to “Family Affair” (1971) and “If You Want Me to Stay” (1973). But by the mid-1970s, Stone’s erratic behavior and substance abuse contributed to the band’s dissolution, and his career never recovered.', 'In Sly Lives!, Thompson features clips from an interview Stone did in 1982 with a fresh-faced Maria Shriver, who asked about his self-destructive tendencies with a blunt question: “You were at that place that every musician wants to be. You get there, and you blow it?”', '“This film changed me personally, because I definitely came in the door trying to mirror [Shriver] … to create as close to an intervention talk to my community as I could,” Thompson says. He wanted to start a conversation about the unique pressure Black artists face, and how they can lead to self-sabotaging behavior even amid great success.', '“The hardest part of this film, the reason it took two-and-a-half years, is because I requested 19 talking heads for this film,” he adds. “I got D’Angelo, [A Tribe Called Quest’s] Q-Tip and [Outkast’s] Andre 3000, but the amount of people that stood us up …. Talking about our feelings is just a brand-new concept and leaves people in a state of mistrust.”', 'Thompson believes artists’ reluctance to show vulnerable emotions comes from the way Black people have learned to avoid trauma and oppression by hiding in plain sight. “Not many people know that the history of ‘cool’ is literally to be devoid of emotion,” he notes. “You don’t know if I’m happy or sad; you just lay in the cut, very quiet. And just like with soul food, we made something toxic sexy. But to be emotionless puts you in a position where your mental and physical health might be up for grabs. And not in a good way.”', 'One talking head who doesn’t appear is Sly Stone himself. He’s represented by clips from three interviews recorded at crucial moments in his past. Thompson says he interviewed Stone, who is now 82, for Summer of Soul, but Thompson wasn’t happy with the footage.', '“He’s not in the best of health, and it would have been too distracting, very jarring,” he says, adding, “No interview now was ever going to match the type of reflection [found in the other interviews], because these journalists just asked him the rawest questions ever.”', 'Patel says he and Thompson share the goal of using specific stories to explore larger ideas about society, art and artists. “Sly Lives! is about an artist — the rise, reign and fall of one of the great American artists of all time,” he adds. “But we extrapolate that into this idea Ahmir has that Black artists aren’t allowed to be fully human. They’re not allowed to go through the spectrum of emotions and behavior that any normal human being would go through. And so, Ahmir brings this big idea, and it’s sort of my job to build it.”', 'Whenever anyone talks about Thompson’s documentary on SNL’s music, the first thing that comes up is the montage.', 'It’s difficult to describe for anyone who hasn’t seen the first seven minutes of Ladies & Gentlemen … 50 Years of SNL Music. Somehow, Thompson and his producers weaved together a long sequence of clips featuring artists performing on Saturday Night Live, mixed so that the sounds from some performances blended with others, as footage from different performances plays together on split screens.', 'In this way, Prince’s performance of “Partyup” blends with Rick James’s “Super Freak” so that it sounds — if only for a moment — like the two famous funk rivals were playing together at the same time in SNL’s legendary Studio 8H.', 'Ditto with footage of Cher singing “I Found Someone” into Hanson’s “MMMBop,” Run-DMC’s “Walk This Way” with Hall & Oates’s “I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do)” and Queen performing “Under Pressure” blending into Dave Matthews Band’s “Ants Marching,” alongside Vanilla Ice’s “Ice Ice Baby” and Fine Young Cannibals’ “She Drives Me Crazy.”', 'Producing that sequence took about 11 months, and it was assembled after Thompson had managed the herculean feat of watching every episode of Saturday Night Live and chronicling every musical performance — the beats per minute, the keys of the songs and other nuances that would eventually allow the team to mix and match each musical performance over 50 years.', '“I wanted to build a world where Prince and Rick James do a duet together,” he says. “And then we just built on that. Once I got the hard drive [containing every SNL episode], I went through three to seven episodes in a day. On the weekend, I’d get up at 8 in the morning and lay in bed until 6 or 7 p.m., just binge-watching and taking meticulous notes. Around the fourth month, I was like, ‘There are way more magical musical sketches than just the performances.’”', 'Thompson even used his connections to get an on-camera interview with Eddie Murphy, who hadn’t spoken with any other documentarians making NBC-connected films for SNL’s 50th anniversary.', '“That was the one interview where I was starstruck,” says Oz Rodriguez, a longtime director of short pretaped SNL videos, who served as codirector on Ladies & Gentlemen. Rodriguez adds that Thompson’s extensive network often helped smooth over issues. “Sometimes we’d have trouble clearing an artist [getting permission to use a song or performance], and he’d say, ‘Let me text him.’ Problem solved.”', 'Toward the beginning of Sly Lives! Thompson asks a question that he spends the rest of the film trying to answer: What is Black genius?', '“Black genius is the ability to survive the day intact … literally, to survive the day and not get in your own way,” he says. “You can have separation anxiety and guilt, the feeling that you can’t save people, you can’t take them with you. That’s the burden. I think a lot of us [Black artists] just live it and don’t think about it or even talk about it.”', 'Sly Lives! is now streaming on Hulu.', 'This article originally appeared in emmy magazine, issue #4, 2025, under the title ""Music Lessons""', 'TELEVISION ACADEMY', 'CONTACT', 'PRESS', 'POLICIES', 'Website content © Television Academy.\nEMMY, EMMYS, and the Emmy Statuette are registered trademarks and/or copyrights Of ATAS and NATAS.\nTELEVISION ACADEMY and ACADEMY OF TELEVISION ARTS & SCIENCES are registered trademarks of ATAS.', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

Sly & the Family Stone’s 10 Best Songs (Staff Picks),https://www.billboard.com/lists/best-sly-family-stone-songs/,"[""The best from the Sly Stone-led funk, rock and soul outfit, following its leader's passing at age 82."", 'Funk, rock and soul maverick Sly Stone died at 82 on Monday (June 9). According to a statement from his family, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s passing came after “a prolonged battle with COPD and other underlying health issues,” while he was surrounded by family and loved ones.', '“While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come,” the statement continues.', 'That legacy is indeed a singular one, and he built most of it with his eponymous ’60s and ’70s group Sly & the Family Stone. With the band, Sly Stone both scaled the greatest heights of Flower Power utopianism and plumbed the lowest depths of Nixon-era disillusionment, with incisive lyrics, brilliant hooks and grooves that could be as lock-step tight or as meanderingly loose as the song called for.', 'Over the course of their original run, Sly & the Family Stone scored three Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, released at least two albums considered among the greatest of the entire rock era, and played one of the signature sets at 1969’s iconic Woodstock festival. Though the band largely fell into disarray in the mid-’70s, and neither the Family Stone or its leader ever were able to quite recapture their peak prominence, the music lived on through subsequent generations — and could be heard sampled and recycled on major hits by Janet Jackson, LL Cool J, Cypress Hill, the Beastie Boys and countless other later acts.', 'Below, Billboard rounds up our picks for Sly & Co.’s 10 all-time greatest — songs that captured turbulent times and spoke to universal truths, and remain just as potent over a half-century later.', 'Opening with a drum roll and the shouted titular command, Sly & the Family Stone made sure their first masterpiece LP immediately snapped listeners to attention. But “Stand!” is too melodic and empathetic to ever risk coming off didactic, with even directives like “Stand for the things you know are right/ It’s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight” delivered so tenderly it sounds like the band realizes it’s not telling you anything you don’t already know. And unlike too many protests, this one ends in unequivocal victory, as the song closes with a glorious parade of trumpets and jubilant “na-na-na-na-na“s. — ANDREW UNTERBERGER', 'With lullaby organs and a drum groove so clipped and woozy it almost sounds like it’s predicting J Dilla, “Just Like a Baby” made it clear early in There’s a Riot Goin’ On that the Woodstock-era triumphalism of Stand! was well over. While even that album’s angriest songs had energy and purpose to them, the band’s uncertainty is felt throughout the narcotic groove and buried, often wordless vocals here, but with results just as spellbinding — and arguably even funkier. Future generations would agree, as you can hear traces of “Baby” in everything from D’Angelo’s Voodoo to Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” — A.U.', 'A Doris Day song from an Alfred Hitchcock movie might seem like unlikely material for a gospel-inflected funk cover, but Sly Stone never played by anyone’s rules (even his own). Stone spent much of There’s a Riot Goin’ On and follow-up album Fresh tearing down the utopian hippie view of America he’d built in the ‘60s, and “Que Sera, Sera” — which arrived on the latter album’s side two – seems to be his shoulder-shrugging admission that just like everyone else, he ultimately has no idea what the hell is going on in this life. But when the funk is this mellow and the organ playing this heavenly, uncertainty doesn’t sound so quite so scary. — JOE LYNCH', 'Underpinned by a bold lead bass line, this 1973 hit that reached No. 12 on the Hot 100 features one of Sly’s most impressive vocal performances, as he both growls and croons in due course to a girlfriend about what he needs to stay in a relationship. One of the most iconic basslines in funk, its genius is in its steady simplicity, allowing the organ, piano and horn flourishes to really breathe, and Sly’s voice to shine, with no line delivered in the same way twice. Its parent album, Fresh, is one notorious for its overdubs, but even still “Stay” has an improvisational feel, melding the backline rigor with the expressive fluidity that is a hallmark of great funk records. — DAN RYS', 'Something of a thesis statement for the Family Stone, “Family Affair” — which became the band’s third and final No. 1 on the Hot 100 in late 1971 — is a more laid-back groove, with Sly’s voice melting and oozing all over the track as he sings about sibling, parental and newlywed relationships, and what keeps them all together. Trading off vocals with his sister Rose, Sly keeps it simple, with a bass, rhythm guitar and keyboard holding down most of the track, a breezy wah-wah guitar providing flourishes here and there. But as with much of Sly’s work, it’s the sum of its parts that makes “Family Affair” such an enduring cut more than 50 years later.  — D.R.', ""As the multi-racial, multi-gender Sly & the Family Stone emerged in the mid-’60s, its demographic composition wasn’t the only radical thing about it – it also fused the worlds of R&B, soul, and rock and roll in ways that thrilled audiences, but confounded the suits. When the band’s 1967 debut, A Whole New Thing, flopped, management told Stone it was “too funky” and that he should “just do something simple.” “I said, ‘OK, something simple, huh?'” Stone later recounted. That something simple: “Dance to the Music,” which with its relentless rhythm section and direct lyrics, commands listeners to do just that. Stone would go on to make higher-concept music, but “Dance to the Music” is a foundational text in psychedelic soul — and, perhaps more importantly, was a big enough hit that it afforded the ambitious musician the considerable creative freedom he would need moving forward. — ERIC RENNER BROWN"", 'Opening in medias rock, “I Want to Take You Higher” is a blunt battering ram of blues, psych, soul and funk that was initially stowed away as the B-side to “Stand!”, but hit America’s eardrums so hard that it went top 40 in its own right. This rallying cry is the sound of Sly Stone and his merry pranksters pushing James Brown’s meticulously timed funk off its foundations, destabilizing it with the untethered energy of an off-the-rails rock n’ roll jam session. The studio version feels like it might fling off into the ether at a moment’s notice — and in concert (including at Woodstock), it often did. — J.L.', 'For those rare times in life when there’s no riot goin’ on and nothing immediately pressing to take a stand over, there can simply be “Hot Fun in the Summertime.” Sly & the Family Stone’s most classic-sounding pop song — tone down a couple of those vocal ad libs and it could’ve easily been a Nat King Cole standard — remains a seasonal perennial for its sun-tanned horns, nostalgic lyrics and impossibly breezy sway, one of the most topical bands of its era proving it could be be just as potent blissing out in the shade for two and a half minutes. But like all truly great good-time songs, “Summertime” also comes tinged with the unmistakable sadness of knowing it’s all too good to last: “First of the fall, and then she goes back/ Bye, bye, bye, bye.” — A.U.', 'This is the rare example of a band figuring itself out in a transitional period while still delivering its best work. Sly and the Family Stone achieved so much and evolved so quickly from 1967-69, it’s no wonder that Stone felt compelled to craft a song that served as both a meta victory lap and farewell to his bright, buoyant first chapter before segueing into a lyrically and sonically murkier second act. But how many artists can write a song about their biggest, most beloved hits that’s also better than damn near all of them? Larry Graham’s slap bass gets a lot of the credit, but the tightly wound guitars, woozy horns and staccato vocals are equally hypnotic. — J.L.', 'Sly & The Family Stone’s first of three No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100 was more than a massive hit – it was a reflection of contemporary American society. Released in November 1968, as one of the most tumultuous years in American history drew to a close, “Everyday People” uses near-childlike simplicity (“There is a blue one who can’t accept the green one/ For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one”) to urge Americans to come together despite their differences. The song had an immediate impact and a lasting influence, from helping to mint a new catchphrase (“different strokes for different folks,” originally popularized by Muhammad Ali and later the inspiration for the title of the TV show Diff’rent Strokes) to featuring an early instance of the slap-bass technique. And few moments in Sly’s catalog are as singularly stunning as when he and his bandmates arrive at the first chorus shout: “I am everyday people!” — E.R.B.', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

""After a prolonged battle with COPD and other underlying health issues, Sly passed away peacefully, surrounded by his three children, his closest friend, and his extended family.', '""While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.""', 'After huge chart-topping success in the 1960s and 1970s, Stone had become an enigmatic and largely reclusive figure plagued by homelessness and health issues. He also had endured financial problems amid management disputes, at one point winning a $5 million judgment for unpaid royalties that was later overturned. In one dire period, reports indicated that the Woodstock icon was living in a van in Los Angeles.', 'But despite such misfortunes, the music created by the Texas-born California transplant and his trendsetting multiracial, multigendered Bay Area band, the Family Stone, had never stopped being a touchstone for generations of musicians.', 'Among Stone\'s oft-covered but never matched hits are ""I Want to Take You Higher,"" ""Hot Fun in the Summertime,"" ""Stand!"" and the infectious and phonetically titled funk anthem, ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).""', 'The statement from Stone\'s family hailed him as ""a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk and rock music,” one whose songs “have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable.”', 'Stone\'s family noted that the musician had recently completed a screenplay for his life story and concluded: ""We extend our deepest gratitude for the outpouring of love and prayers during this difficult time.

Hits followed in short order, starting with 1968\'s ""Dance to the Music"" and ""Everyday People,"" both of which celebrated the sheer and simple joy created when music brings the masses together.', 'But Stone\'s compositions also frequently plumbed deep depths, with lyrics that pierced as ably as they moved. In ""Family Affair,"" Stone\'s sensitive growl intones: ""One child grows up to be/ Somebody that just loves to learn/ And another child grows up to be/ Somebody you\'d just love to burn/ Mom loves the both of them/ You see, it\'s in the blood/ Both kids are good to mom/ Blood\'s thicker than the mud.""', 'By 1969, Stone and his group were among the most well-known bands in the nation, and performed a memorable set at that year\'s Woodstock festival in upstate New York, a hallmark of which was the band\'s audience-lifting rendition of ""I Want to Take You Higher.""', 'The band also performed that year at the Summer of Soul concert in Harlem, an event memorialized in the documentary of the same name by Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson. (Questlove went on to direct “Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius),"" a 2025 Hulu documentary focused on Stone.', ""While Stone's band was among the earliest of the '60s groups to feature a mix of genders and races (including founding member and trumpet player Cynthia Robinson and founding drummer Greg Errico), Stone was the leader and visionary who steered the band's direction."", ""Often cloaked in elaborate stage clothing, his massive Afro glowing, Stone's looks and music were an indisputable harbinger of the coming funk revolution that would take the foundational innovations of James Brown and propel it to an otherworldly showboating level as best exemplified by the huge success of '70s legends such as George Clinton and his Parliament-Funkadelic band."", 'But the rocket-ship ride to fame would quickly come crashing back to earth. By 1971, with the band addled by drug use and internal strife, Sly and the Family Stone would increasingly lose tour bookings and fail to produce music that matched the songs of just a few years prior.', ""While Stone spent the '70s working on new music, often on his own since he played numerous instruments, success proved elusive. In 1983, he was arrested in Florida on drug charges. More trouble and misfortune found its way to Stone's doorstep in the coming years, although in 1993 he did make a public appearance during the band's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."", ""A decade later, in 2005, Stone, by now almost a legendary ghost, was spotted at a Los Angeles club after driving his sister Vet, who was in a Family Stone tribute band, to her gig on his motorcycle. The next year, Stone shocked thrilled attendees at the Grammy Awards by taking the stage, resplendent in a huge blond mohawk, as his band roared through a number of hits during the show's salute to the seminal group."", 'In 2009, documentarian Willem Alkema released ""Coming Back for More,"" a look at Stone\'s life and career. The director told journalists at the time that Stone was homeless, but the pioneering musician nonetheless made a number of appearances, however brief, at California festivals.', 'In 2023, Stone released his autobiography, the first book released by Questlove\'s imprint, which aptly took its title from his song, ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)."" The book received mixed reviews, as its subject seemed a bit at a loss to recall that epic golden period so long ago that created those unforgettable songs.', 'But one excerpt captures the delightful lyricism that he brought to his hits, and serves as a reminder that genius never really fades.', ""Of many others who over the years tried to tell Stone's story, he wrote: “They’re trying to set the record straight. But a record’s not straight, especially when you’re not. It’s a circle with a spiral inside it. Every time a story is told, it’s a test of memory and motive. … It isn’t evil but it isn’t good.

From the moment his music reached me in the early 1970s, it became a part of my soul. Sly was a giant — not just for his groundbreaking work with the Family Stone, but for the radical inclusivity and deep human truths he poured into every note,” he wrote. “His songs weren’t just about fighting injustice; they were about transforming the self to transform the world. He dared to be simple in the most complex ways — using childlike joy, wordless cries, and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.”', 'The Roots drummer also highlighted two lines that “haunt me” as he reflected on his legacy: “We deserve everything we get in this life” from Sly Lives! and “We got to live together” from the group’s 1969 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Everyday People.” “Once idealistic, now I hear it as a command.

Sly’s artistry influenced so many of our important creative talents. He will be forever missed.”', 'KISS frontman Paul Stanley remembered seeing Sly and the Family Stone “debut at the Fillmore East in New York City opening for Jimi Hendrix.

"Sly Stone, dazzling funk maestro with the Family Stone, dies at 82",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2025/06/09/sly-stone-music-family-dies/,"['He electrified Woodstock crowds with his brand of psychedelic funk but fell into a fog of drug abuse at the height of his musical powers.', 'Sly Stone, whose band Sly and the Family Stone electrified Woodstock audiences and introduced a genre-fusing brand of psychedelic funk with hits such as “Family Affair” and “Everyday People” but then mostly vanished from the music scene for decades in the grip of drug abuse, died June 9 at his home in Granada Hills, California. He was 82.', 'The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other health-related complications, said his manager, Arlene Hirschkowitz.', 'Mr. Stone’s musical adventurism and ear for the times created an enduring soundtrack of the 1960s and early ’70s. The joyful “Hot Fun in the Summertime” in 1969 was a break from the era’s political storms; the boom-laka-laka-laka mojo of “I Want to Take You Higher” that same year uncorked pure energy. The song had the Woodstock throng dancing at 4 a.m. on Aug. 17, 1969, with Mr. Stone jamming on keyboards and roaming the stage in a white jumpsuit with fringe flying and his Afro haloed by the lights.', '“I sang, ‘I want to take you higher,’ and they sang back the last word, ‘higher.’ All of them. Damn. We kept it going. I kept it going,” Mr. Stone wrote in his 2023 memoir, co-authored with music journalist Ben Greenman, “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” the song title of another Sly and the Family Stone chart-climber in 1970.', 'This was Mr. Stone in full command of his craft. For years, he had experimented with wrapping strains of soul, rock and gospel’s call-and-response style around a funk downbeat. By the summer of 1969, his sound had come together, breaking into mainstream radio and riding the currents at the end of a wild decade of change and upheaval.', 'Mr. Stone could be edgy and rebellious in his music, using the n-word in a song warning “Whitey” not to evoke the term. Then he’d amble into a happy place with tracks such as 1968’s slinky “Dance to the Music.” He channeled the Age of Aquarius with songs from 1969’s “Stand!” album such as “You Can Make It If You Try” and the prejudice-bashing “Everyday People.”', 'There is a yellow one that won’t', 'Accept the Black one', 'Follow Music', 'That won’t accept the red one', 'That won’t accept the White one', 'Different strokes for different folks', 'Like the ’60s itself, Mr. Stone’s music spanned generations in its influence. The band’s bass-slapping funk groove was embraced by groups such as the Ohio Players and Mr. Stone’s friend George Clinton in his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. Others — from Michael Jackson to Stevie Wonder to Prince to the Black Eyed Peas — carried on Mr. Stone’s eclectic musical mixology. Sly and the Family Stone was “like Noah’s ark,” musician and record producer Don Was wrote in Rolling Stone. “They had Blacks and Whites, men and women. … This was a joyful noise and a joyful vision.”', 'To Mr. Stone, the band and its eclectic beats came from his own street anthropology. “I wasn’t going on any other program or agenda or philosophy,” Mr. Stone told Vanity Fair in 2007. “It was just what I observed, where I was at.”', 'He also was disappearing into a fog of drugs just as he reached his peak popularity. Cocaine and PCP, known as angel dust, became his escapes. He started showing up late for gigs or not at all. More than a third of the band’s 80 concerts were canceled in 1970. A riot broke out in Chicago’s Grant Park that July when fans wrongly believed that the band — late as usual — was a no-show.', 'More and more, Mr. Stone holed up in a rented mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, hosting nonstop parties or riding a solo drug-and-booze bender surrounded by a pit bull named Gun and mobsters doubling as bodyguards.', 'With the 1971 album “There’s a Riot Goin’ On,” the band cast off much of its brightness and can’t-we-get-along glow. The music took on darker tones and a muddier sound — the result of Mr. Stone obsessively overdubbing the tracks in a makeshift studio: a Winnebago parked in the mansion’s driveway.', 'The album’s “Family Affair” was the band’s last chart-topping single, spending three weeks leading the Billboard Hot 100. (In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked the band 43rd among its Greatest Artists of All Time, just behind Van Morrison.)', 'The core of Sly and the Family Stone — which included some of Mr. Stone’s real family — held together for two more albums. But his unreliability was corrosive. In the end, by many accounts, it was Mr. Stone who effectively broke ranks. He peeled away for several independent projects (sometimes still using the band’s name) and collaborations that reviewers found stiff and uninspired.', 'Mr. Stone made more headlines as a tragicomic spectacle. Seemingly high on something, Mr. Stone left the normally unflappable talk show host Dick Cavett slack-jawed in 1971. “You’re great,” gushed Mr. Stone. He pounded his heart.', '“Boom! Right on! Sure thing,” Mr. Stone rambled. “No, for real. For real, Dick. Hey, Dick. Dick. Dick. You’re great.” He grabbed Cavett’s hands to clap them together.', 'Cavett deadpanned: “Well, you’re not so bad yourself.”', '“Well,” said Mr. Stone. “I am kinda bad.” A pause and half-smile. “But I’m not so bad.”', 'On the “The Mike Douglas Show” in 1974, Mr. Stone repeatedly interrupted a stone-faced Muhammad Ali and tried to hoist the champ’s arm in a Black Power-ish salute. Ali yanked it away. “If you don’t like it,” said a rail-thin and bleary-eyed Mr. Stone, “I’m going to whoop you.”', 'Even Mr. Stone’s wedding was a scene. He married a 19-year-old actress, Kathy Silva, at Madison Square Garden before a concert in June 1974 — but backed off plans to release thousands of doves and have a high-wire “angel” sprinkle glitter over the crowd. Before the year was out, the couple was divorced. Mr. Stone’s pit bull had attacked their 1-year-old son, Sylvester Bubb Ali Stewart Jr.', 'When Sly and the Family Stone was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, Mr. Stone was on hand. But he snubbed his siblings and other former bandmates — and then largely disappeared from public view for years.', '“He’s been in seclusion for so long, he’s like J.D. Salinger,” Greg Zola, a director working on a documentary about Stone and the band, told The Washington Post in 2006, referring to the reclusive author of “The Catcher in the Rye.” (Zola’s “Small Talk About Sly” was released in 2017.)', 'Mr. Stone surfaced at the 2006 Grammy Awards, which included a tribute to Sly and the Family Stone. He was called onstage by Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler: “Hey, Sly, let’s do it like we used to do it!” Mr. Stone, in a silver lamé outfit and towering bleach-blond mohawk, joined “I Want to Take You Higher” on keyboards. Three minutes later, Mr. Stone wandered off the stage mid-jam.', 'It was never clear which version of Mr. Stone would show up as he made his way back into music. At a 2008 concert in Santa Rosa, California, he told the audience he needed to go to the bathroom and never returned. But there also were thoughtful and reflective moments.', 'In a 2009 interview with NPR affiliate KCRW in Santa Monica, California, Mr. Stone was asked about the meaning behind his 1970 hit “If You Want Me to Stay.” It was a message to his band and fans as his drug use deepened, he replied. “If you want me to stay, let me know, otherwise sayonara … friends, audience, everybody,” he said.', 'A decade after that interview, doctors told Mr. Stone that crack cocaine had left his body near collapse. He said he chose to get sober, but he was too physically battered by then to return to the studio or stage.', 'His health troubles “haven’t stopped me from hearing music,” he told the Guardian, “but they have stopped me from making it.”', 'Sylvester Stewart was born in Denton, Texas, on March 15, 1943, and grew up in Vallejo, California, north of Oakland. His father ran a janitorial business and was a deacon at a Pentecostal church; his mother helped form their five children into a gospel ensemble.', 'Sylvester — the second child — formed the Stewart Four with his brother Fred and sisters Rose and Vaetta. The eldest, Loretta, played piano. As a teenager, he joined a doo-wop group, the Viscaynes, and later studied music at Vallejo Junior College (now Solano Community College.) He started trying out the nickname Sly after a fifth-grade classmate misspelled his first name as “Slyvester.”', 'In 1964, he signed with Autumn Records and cut several singles. Mr. Stone initially shined more as a producer, teaming up with rhythm-and-blues stylist Bobby Freeman on the 1964 hit “C’mon and Swim.” Mr. Stone then worked on records with bands including Great Society (led by Grace Slick, later of Jefferson Airplane) and the Warlocks, which became the Grateful Dead. Under a new name, Sly Stone, he landed jobs as a disc jockey at AM stations in the Bay Area, perfecting a flat and raspy vocal style that became a hallmark of some of his songs.', 'At the same time, he was developing the overall Sly panache. His Jaguar XKE was painted candy purple, and he wore clothes to match. His first band, the Stoners, broke up in 1966. His next try included his brother Fred on guitar (sister Rose later joined as pianist) along with other Bay Area musicians.', 'Sly and the Family Stone’s 1967 debut album, “A Whole New Thing,” had modest sales. But Mr. Stone had laid down his marker. The songs sampled from a rich musical buffet and his band had a big-tent identity of race and gender.', 'He liked to surprise. The band’s 1973 album “Fresh” included a gospel-infused version of “Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be Will Be),” which had been popularized in the 1950s by actress Doris Day. (Mr. Stone and Day, who met through her music producer son Terry Melcher, became improbable friends.) A 1971 tune, “Spaced Cowboy,” included Mr. Stone yodeling like a member of the von Trapp family featured in the film “The Sound of Music.”', 'Then it all started to unravel. At times, Mr. Stone appeared just one bad break away from homelessness. A 2009 documentary, “Coming Back for More,” portrayed Mr. Stone living in a camper van and getting by with help from friends and relatives.', 'Mr. Stone blamed most of his financial woes on his former manager, Jerry Goldstein, alleging that he and others cheated him out of tens of millions of dollars in royalties. In January 2015, a Los Angeles jury awarded the musician $5 million, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The jury had not been told that Mr. Stone had assigned his royalties to a production company in exchange for an ownership stake. The company, however, foundered.', 'In addition to his son with his former wife, Mr. Stone had daughters Sylvyette Robinson and Novena Carmel with different partners; a brother; two sisters; and four grandchildren.', 'During Mr. Stone’s interview with Vanity Fair, reporter David Kamp asked about his life during the hermit years. Did he keep up on new TV shows? Read? Did he know of “American Idol?”', '“I do regular things a lot,” Mr. Stone said. “But it’s probably more of a Sly Stone life. It’s probably … it’s probably not very normal.”', 'What readers are saying', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNUZOMlJqWjNwUFNsWm9hM0p3VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhdFE0eVBIUWs=-w280-h168-p-df
"R.I.P. Sly Stone, Sly and the Family Stone singer and funk music legend",https://www.avclub.com/sly-stone-obituary-sly-and-the-family-stone,"['Sly Stone—frontman of Sly and the Family Stone and funk music pioneer—has died. “After a prolonged battle with COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] and other underlying health issues, Sly passed away peacefully, surrounded by his three children, his closest friend and his extended family,” a statement from his family reads, per Variety. “While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.” They also added that Stone “recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course.” Stone was 82.', 'Born Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, Stone’s musical career began in the single digits. He made his first record appearance at the age of 9 on a gospel single recorded by the Stewart Four, a group that also included his brother, Freddie. With his band Sly and the Family Stone (which included Freddie), he would go on to change the face of funk music through energetic, chart-topping singles like “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People,” and “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” as well as a legendary performance at the original Woodstock festival. ', '', '“Sly created the alphabet that we are still using to express music,” Questlove, who just released his documentary <i>Sly Lives! (AKA The Burden Of Black Genius)</i> earlier this year, said of the artist, per Variety. “He was the first to take advantage of being a bedroom musician, multi-track recording, the wah-wah, the drum machine, and doing everything by himself. We praise Stevie Wonder and Prince for these things, but Sly was the prototype. He also single-handedly revived hip-hop with all of the samples that came from him.”', 'But while dozens of artists modeled their sound after the genre he pioneered, Stone was “never annoyed” by the imitators, as he told The Guardian in 2023. “I was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own. I’m proud that the music I made inspired people.”', '', 'Even as Stone’s seminal 1971 album There’s A Riot Goin’ On hit number one on the charts, there was trouble brewing for the band. Stone’s erratic behavior, missed shows, and drug use escalated, eventually leading to the end of the group. Stone recorded a number of less successful solo albums in the following years and collaborated with artists like Bobby Womack and Jesse Johnson. He was also in and out of jail during this time, and dealt with addiction and homelessness later in his life.
