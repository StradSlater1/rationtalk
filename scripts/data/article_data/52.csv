Would the team be able to stay afloat as Clark recovered? The Fever have done well enough without Clark, managing a 2-2 record in her absence, the same record they had with Clark before she got hurt."", 'But widespread interest in the Fever has taken a downturn.

And how can fans purchase tickets for her return? Here's everything you need to know about Clark's injury and eventual return."", ""When Clark's injury first occurred, the Fever made it clear that they would not rush their star back to the court, prioritizing her long-term health over the team's short-term success.

Clark injury leads to uncertainty as to whether Sky-Fever can set attendance record,https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/06/06/clark-injury-leads-to-uncertainty-as-to-whether-sky-fever-can-set-attendance-record/,"['The Sky face a “major question” when they host the Fever on Saturday as to whether they can “still set a WNBA single-game attendance record” at the 20,923-capacity United Center, according to Julia Poe of the CHICAGO TRIBUNE. The Mystics set the record in September with 20,711 attending a game against the Fever at Capital One Arena. The United Center’s larger capacity “provides a chance for the Sky to break that record without a full sellout,” but Fever G Caitlin Clark will be out due to an injury. Tickets resales for the upcoming Fever-Sky game “took a hit” when\u202fthe Fever announced that Clark would be out at least two weeks, and the “momentum behind ticket sales shifted accordingly.” Initial ticket sales are not “a concern.” Fewer than 500 original tickets at the United Center remained available via Ticketmaster as of Wednesday. The majority “were in the 100 level,” where prices began at $393. According to TickPick, Clark’s injury “sent the resale market plummeting, with prices dropping by an average of 70% in the first 48 hours after her injury was announced.” Upper-level tickets originally priced at $125 “are now available for less than $20 on SeatGeek.” Early ticket sales for the Fever’s return to the United Center in July reflect pre-injury projections for Saturday’s game. If Clark returns on her current timeline, she “would be available to help boost the final attendance for the rematch” (CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 6/5).', 'IS THE PRICE RIGHT? In Boston, Julian Benbow noted that even “without Clark,” the Mystics-Fever game at CFG Bank Arena, which has a capacity of 14,000, drew 11,183 fans. Clark was “healthy a week before,” when the Fever were in Atlanta to face the Dream on May 22. With Clark in town, they played at State Farm Arena and sold 17,044 tickets. In three home games prior to Clark’s injury, the Fever averaged 16,939 tickets sold. In two without her, the dip to 16,113 “wasn’t necessarily dramatic.” Clark’s absence “hasn’t dramatically shaken Fever viewership, either.” According to Sports Media Watch, their matchup against the Sun averaged 851,000 viewers on ION. If there has “been a shift, it’s been in ticket prices.” For Saturday’s matchup between the Fever and Sky, which typically\u202fattracts a crowd because of the connection between Clark\u202fand\u202fSky F Angel Reese, StubHub’s get-in price was just $14 (BOSTON GLOBE, 6/6).', 'HISTORIC MOMENT: In Chicago, Jeff Agrest noted TV producer Deb Boulac will lead a historic broadcast Saturday when CBS airs the Fever-Sky game at the United Center -- the “first regular-season game in WNBA history to air on broadcast TV in prime time.” Play-by-play broadcaster Jordan Kent will call the action with analyst Isis Young and reporter Tiffany Blackmon.

', ""Colson (upper left leg) and Cunningham (right ankle) both left the Fever's 85-83 loss to the Connecticut Sun on Friday. While the imaging was positive, it's unclear if either will be available for the Fever's next game on Tuesday against the Washington Mystics. "", '""I think we got good news from both of their MRIs, as good of news as you can get,"" White said. ""And so right now, it\'s a day-to-day thing. We\'re looking forward to hopefully them returning at some point sooner rather than later, but at the same time, it\'s how each of them progresses in their rehab.""', 'With Caitlin Clark (left quad) also sidelined until at least June 10, the Fever are temporarily down to eight healthy players and hoping to sign a replacement player for Tuesday night. ', ""With just under 90 seconds remaining in the first quarter of Friday's game, Colson was driving to her right and lost control of the ball. Sun guard Jacy Sheldon dove to the floor to try and gain possession, and rolled up Colson's leg in the process. As the Sun took off the other way, Colson remained down. "", ""After the Sun scored, the Fever took a timeout to stop play, and Colson was attended to by the team's medical staff. Colson briefly tried to remain on the bench, but then hobbled back to the locker room. While she walked under her own power, she was moving gingerly. "", 'White called Colson\'s injury a ""gut punch,"" and said it made the team ""reconfigure"" what they were doing on the offensive end.

But the reality is this stuff happens. We\'ve seen it time and time again in our league. We can\'t take two and a half quarters to figure it out.""', ""Colson, who made her WNBA debut in 2011, signed with the Fever in free agency this winter. She was primarily brought in for her experience, and had only received spot minutes in the team's first four games. "", ""When Clark went down with a quad injury, however, Colson was inserted into the Fever's starting lineup. As the only other true point guard on the roster, she was the natural choice. "", '""[Colson] is an elite communicator,"" White said earlier this week. ""She is in every huddle that we have, whether she\'s on the floor or not. She sees things from that point guard position. And getting us into offense. It\'s gonna look different without the ball in Caitlin\'s hands. What are our looks, who can we get our looks for? And then the ability to communicate that to everybody in live action. That\'s the piece that we\'re still growing with. We can\'t call a timeout every time to get a matchup or recognize a switch, so she can help us with that on the floor."" ', ""White also said Cunningham would get a chance to run the offense in Clark's stead, but she didn't get much of an opportunity Friday. "", ""In the middle of the fourth quarter, Cunningham set an off-ball screen for Kelsey Mitchell, which Sheldon blew up by running straight through Cunningham's chest. As Cunningham tried to regain her balance, she rolled her right ankle -- the same one she injured during the preseason, which kept her out of the first two games of the regular season -- and collapsed to the ground in serious pain. "", ""Cunningham remained on the floor for a while as the Fever's medical staff assessed the situation. She was eventually brought to her feet and had to be helped to the locker room. Cunningham did not return to the game. "", ""The Fever are now 0-2 without Clark in the lineup and have fallen to 2-4 on the season. Clark's initial two-week timeline has her out for at least two more games, and the earliest she could return is June 10 against the Atlanta Dream. If Colson and Cunningham are both sidelined until then as well, things could get even uglier for the Fever. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Indiana Fever provide disappointing update on Caitlin Clark’s status ahead of big game,https://www.sbnation.com/wnba/2025/6/9/24446174/indiana-fever-update-caitlin-clarks-status-injury,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Fans will have to wait a little longer for Caitlin Clark’s return to the court, says head coach Steph White.', '', 'Two weeks ago, Caitlin Clark was sidelined from her Indiana Fever team to rest a strained quadricep. The Fever said she would be out at least two weeks, and then re-evaluated. In the time she has been out of the lineup, the Fever have gone 2-2 in games, struggling to replace Clark’s offensive load and playmaking ability. Now, at the two-week mark since the injury was announced, fans may have been hopeful they would see Clark suit up for the Fever’s Tuesday game against the Atlanta Dream. It seems like they will have to wait a little longer.', 'At Fever practice this morning, Clark was top of mind as reporters gathered to speak with head coach Steph White. White did not give them the answer they may have been hoping for, confirming that Clark will not be playing against the Dream.', 'Caitlin Clark will not play tomorrow, Steph White says.\n\nShe’s not necessarily cleared for basketball activities, but ready to start “ramping back up.”\n\nSophie Cunningham was also limited in practice today.\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/jvehgM7VYv', 'In the NBA and WNBA, players often need a little bit of time (a few days) after the injury itself has healed to recondition themselves after resting. With Clark, since she was resting her leg, she likely was not doing much by way of running, conditioning, or strength work, and will need time to gradually increase physical activity to prevent re-injury. Based on White’s comments here of her being ready to “ramp up” but not cleared for basketball, it seems that may be the case here.', 'The Dream game is the only game the Fever have this week before facing New York at home on Saturday, in what will be an important and marquee event for both teams. The Fever would love to not only have Clark back but also re-enter the championship contention conversation. For New York, their undefeated streak may be in jeopardy if the Fever have Clark back and are playing at their peak level.', 'Yet, before they get to that game, not having Clark to go against the Atlanta Dream is disappointing. The Dream (5-3) are in third place in the overall WNBA standings, right below the undefeated Liberty and Minnesota Lynx. Allisha Gray won the WNBA’s Eastern Player of the Month Award for May, and the team is 3-2 on the road this season. They have been finding a flow of both offence and defence under Karl Smesko as their coach, looking the best the team has in years. Not having Clark to offset the offense that will come from Gray, Rhyne Howard and Brittney Griner, among others on the Dream roster, will hurt them.', 'The Fever are 1-1 against the Dream so far this season, having lost the first game by 1 point despite a 27-point game from Clark. They played them again shortly after, this time Clark dishing out a game-high 6 assists to help her team win. They will miss both her high-volume scoring and passing ability in this third game, especially if Sophie Cunningham also remains out for Indiana.', 'So while White’s update on Clark was vague, it seems the Fever star is heading in the right direction. The fact that she is allowed to start ramping up again proves her condition is improving. Rushing it wouldn’t do anyone good, so taking the time to ensure she is healthy during what will be an important stretch now for the Fever is ideal.', 'Clark herself said last week that it’s “not worth” rushing back to play before her body is ready. She also confirmed that after the weekend passed, her injury status would be day-to-day, and that no one wants to put an exact date on her return. She said she was in some pain after the last game that she played against New York on May 24, which led to her getting an MRI and confirming that she had a strain in her muscle. Instead of focusing on the negatives of not playing, she has redirected that energy to her recovery and being a good teammate to the rest of the Fever roster.', 'Indiana is currently at 4-4 on their season, sitting in 7th place in the WNBA standings. They are at a 4.5 game balance difference from the Minnesota Lynx, who sit at the top of the league at 9-0 on their season. Bridging a 4.5 game balance difference isn’t too daunting at this stage of the season, but as the Lynx and Liberty just keep stacking wins, the Fever need to start making that number smaller if they are going to rise back up in the standings.', 'Ensuring Clark’s long-term health will be crucial to the Fever’s playoff goals this season, so fans will need to remain patient as they wait for Clark to re-enter the lineup.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNVZSMlI2Tm05RExYbGlkSEpwVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdhSk1JanRGUW8=-w280-h168-p-df

She reported some pain after the game and got an MRI, which showed a strain in her left quad."", ""“Obviously, adrenaline covers up a lot of stuff when you're in the heat of battle,” Clark said during her media availability on June 3. “And after the game, I had some pain, and then we got an MRI, and that kind of gave me the result that I didn't want to see. But, you know, those types of things don't lie.”"", ""Clark's original timeline was that she would be out for two weeks before she would be re-evaluated, setting her re-evaluation date at June 8. She was evaluated this weekend and allowed to begin some aspects of practice again, White said, but not necessarily cleared for basketball activities at the highest level."", '""I don\'t know if cleared is the right word, I mean, she\'s ready to start ramping back up,"" White said. ""But it\'s completely different when you\'re just doing 1-on-1 workouts, and when you\'re out there in 5-on-5, getting up and down the floor, moving laterally. So she\'s been allowed to do some practicing, not everything. And we\'re gonna be smart, and we\'re gonna be cautious, and we\'re gonna play the long game.""', 'Clark participated in the portion of practice open to media Monday afternoon, which were shooting drills from midrange and 3-point range. They went around the arc as a team, making shots from each corner, each wing and the top of the key.', ""Clark didn't seem limited in that portion of practice, running for rebounds and shooting as normal. But shooting drills are much different than actual practice — both in the amount of contact and the intricacies of it."", '""It\'s one thing to do some shooting drills,"" White said. ""It\'s another thing to get out there on the floor, get back into movement patterns, rhythm, timing, and so that\'s what part of, you know, picking and choosing things that they can be in in practice, so that we can see their progression.""', ""White did not provide a specific timeline for Clark's return to the court. The Fever play at Atlanta on Tuesday, then return to Indianapolis and a have a few days off before playing the New York Liberty on Saturday."", 'No, the Fever star will miss her fifth straight game as she recovers from a quad injury.
