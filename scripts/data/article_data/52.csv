That‚Äôs because Gauff, an American, was taking on a French opponent ‚Äî and one who came from nowhere, 361st-ranked Lo√Øs Boisson.', 'So the No. 2-seeded Gauff turned to a trick that 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic has talked about using: When the partisan crowd was loudly singing Boisson‚Äôs first name, Gauff pretended they were chanting ‚ÄúCoco!‚Äù Not that it mattered much, truly, because Gauff was by far the superior player throughout a 6-1, 6-2 victory that earned her a second trip to the final at Roland-Garros.', 'Three years ago, Gauff missed out on a chance to leave with the trophy when Iga Swiatek beat her. This time, Swiatek won‚Äôt be around for the championship match on Saturday, because her 26-match unbeaten run at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament ended earlier Thursday with a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 loss to No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.', 'Sabalenka vs. Gauff will be the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years.', 'Sabalenka, a 27-year-old from Belarus who owns three major titles, and Gauff have split their 10 previous matchups evenly.

The flags flapping in the stands, and the raucous applause and yells accompanying each point Boisson won, were hard to miss.', '‚ÄúI was mentally prepared before the match that it was going to be 99% for her. But I just tried to block it out,‚Äù Gauff told the spectators during her on-court interview, laughing as she explained her thought process. ‚ÄúAnd actually, when you guys were chanting her name, I was saying to myself my name. Just to kind of psych myself out. You have to do that.‚Äù', 'Then she added: ‚ÄúI know you guys would usually root for me if I‚Äôm not playing a French (foe).‚Äù', 'Gauff never really allowed the atmosphere to become much of a factor, because she took Boisson out of the match from the get-go, grabbing 20 of the first 30 points to lead 4-0.', 'As much as Boisson‚Äôs game is fit for clay, Gauff is rather adept on the slower surface, too. Her speed and reflexes allow her to track down shot after shot, elongating points and making the player across the net come up with the goods over and over.', 'Boisson finished with just seven winners. And Gauff made only 15 unforced errors, fewer than half of Boisson‚Äôs total of 33.', 'When the exchanges grew longer, Gauff got better. She won 34 of 51 points that lasted five strokes or more.', '‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt play my game today,‚Äù Boisson said, ‚Äúbecause she was just too good.‚Äù', 'Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

It was a formative experience for the Italian, but it now feels like it was three decades rather than three years ago. Since then Alcaraz has become a Grand Slam champion four times over, and he has also won five consecutive matches against the talented Italian.\n\nThe pendulum is swinging ever so slowly back to Musetti‚Äôs side these days, as the Italian‚Äôs massive progress in the last 52 weeks has given him newfound belief that he can hang with Alcaraz in a big match like a Roland-Garros semi.\n\nBut believing and doing are two different things. As good as Musetti has been of late ‚Äì his 19-3 record on clay is a testament ‚Äì Alcaraz has been better. The 22-year-old Spaniard rides a 12-match Roland-Garros winning streak into Friday‚Äôs clash and has won 32 of 34 matches on clay dating back to the start of his run to his maiden Roland-Garros title this year.\n\nHe‚Äôs also defeated Musetti twice to clay in the leadup to Paris, in the Monte-Carlo final (3-6, 6-1, 6-0) and in the Rome semis (6-3, 7-6(4)).\n\nSo what could be different this time? Musetti is a Top-10 player now, and he‚Äôs probably learned a thing or two from those losses, but has he learned enough to turn around a lopsided head-to-head against the surging Spaniard?\n\nOur prediction: It will take an off day from Alcaraz for him to have a chance.\n\nNovak Djokovic vs Jannik Sinner\n\nHead-to-Head: Tied, 4-4\nSinner has won the last three\n\nHere comes 38-year-old Novak Djokovic, looking to crash the Sinner-Alcaraz party this weekend in Paris. The 24-time major champion seeks a record-smashing 25th major title, and to do it he‚Äôll likely have to become the first man to defeat the top three-ranked players en route to a Slam title in Open Era history.\n\nDoes he have it in him? It‚Äôs hard to say, but it seems a lot more possible now, that Djokovic has reeled off nine consecutive wins and put a hurt on third-seeded Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.\n\nIt was vintage Djokovic, as he moved the German around the court as if he was a pawn on a chess board. \n\nThe Serbian legend is confident and, more important, he hasn‚Äôt had to use too much energy to get through his first five matches. About 12 hours and 42 minutes, which should allow him to take his best shot at impervious Sinner.\n\nBut it will be a tough ask. Sinner is on a 19-match Grand Slam winning streak and he has hit the ground running after returning from his three-month doping suspension. One could easily make the argument that he might have the freshest legs on the ATP Tour after sitting on the sidelines while the rest of the tour beat each other silly for three months.\n\nDjokovic, who is the oldest men‚Äôs singles semifinalist in Paris since 1968, will look to shorten points and throw wrinkles around the court to keep Sinner out of rhythm. Based on what we saw last night, he‚Äôs in great shape to do it.\n\nNow let‚Äôs see if the Grand Slam king has another miracle trick up his sleeve\n\nOur prediction: Djokovic will suprise, but it won't be enough in the end.""]",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWZaVWN0U25ZNFpHbDRRVEo1VFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhQkVJNnRFUXM=-w280-h168-p-df

His drop shots didn‚Äôt always land, but they drew some of the biggest gasps and cheers of the evening. Sinner, meanwhile, is relentless in a way which recalls, well, maybe a younger Djokovic.

The Serb wraps up with a firework of an ace. We‚Äôve passed the three-hour mark. Drink, anyone?', 'Sinner* 6-4, 7-5, 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner seems to lose concentration momentarily, dropping two points in quick succession.

He defends the second. Now it‚Äôs time for his fans to roar.', 'Djokovic seizes another break point, an exchange of angled cross-court shots ending with Sinner blasting wide.

Djokovic clinches the hold with a crunching serve which Sinner has no hope of returning.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 7-5, 4-4 Djokovic (*denotes server) Morale never seems to remain boosted for long against Sinner.

He has zero margin for error if he intends to earn a place in the final against all odds.', 'Djokovic is now taking a medical timeout, with the physio seemingly working on his left thigh.', 'This time, despite Djokovic taking the game to deuce, Sinner does the business. Djokovic upped his level in the second set, but the outcome was ultimately the same. Sinner still hasn‚Äôt dropped a set at Roland Garros this year.

Djokovic clenches his fist in defiant celebration.', 'Sinner 6-4, 5-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Djokovic may be in trouble but he isn‚Äôt planning to go quietly. He battles through his service game to hold, leaving Sinner to serve for the second set.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic looks understandably deflated, his accuracy waning as he fails to mount a challenge to Sinner‚Äôs serve. The Italian drops one point on his way to a comfortable hold, producing another superb drop shot winner along the way.', 'Sinner 6-4, 4-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Sinner makes life difficult for Djokovic with a vicious return, but the Serb wins the opening rally with an unstoppable shot that kisses the line. Sinner hits back, forcing his opponent into a shot which drifts long. Sinner makes it 30-15 with a fizzing forehand, but Djokovic drags it back to 30-30. Sinner gives Djokovic a taste of his own medicine with a perfectly executed drop shot to earn break point, taking it after a rally featuring a succession of outrageous drop shots, lobs and slices ends with Djokovic sending a forehand beyond the baseline.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 3-3 Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic wrangles an opportunity, Sinner dropping a couple of points after trying and failing to find the absolute outer limits of the court.

Sinner lets him off with a couple of returns which go just long. At 30-30, Djokovic tries to pull off a tricky drop shot which tumbles into the net. Sinner lets him off again, however, squandering break point. The Italian earns another but that, too, goes begging. Djokovic rallies to close out the game. He‚Äôs steadied the ship, for now at least.', 'Sinner* 4-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner looks far more relaxed than his rival, Djokovic throwing out his hands in frustration after losing the opening point. Sinner‚Äôs serve is just too powerful at the moment. Again, he holds to love. That‚Äôs six points in a row now.', 'Sinner 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server) A high-tempo opening rally ends with Djokovic skewing another attempted drop shot into the net.

An unexpected bounce catches Djokovic cold and, just like that, Sinner is ahead in the first set.', 'Sinner* 2-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic holds up well to Sinner‚Äôs forehand, weathering the opening rally until his opponent whips a shot wide. Sinner follows up with a screaming ace to make it 15-15. Djokovic goes for the drop shot again, but this time it falls the wrong side of the net to draw an audible gasp from the crowd. The Serb‚Äôs shotmaking goes a bit haywire in the final two points and Sinner sees out the game.', 'Sinner 1-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Djokovic coughs up the opening point after sending a shot marginally long. The pair trade drop shots, but Djokovic gets the better of the exchange to make it 15-15. Now it‚Äôs Sinner‚Äôs turn to send a shot marginally beyond the baseline, a call so tight it requires the umpire to leave his chair to double check.

Musetti, the Italian eighth seed, struggled with a left leg injury and quit the match after losing his eighth consecutive game, with Alcaraz progressing 4-6 7-6 (3) 6-0 2-0.', '‚ÄúSad and disappointed on how it ended,‚Äù said Musetti, who was bidding to reach his first grand slam final. ‚ÄúBut still a great match. I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and [it was] definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop. I think it was the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted.‚Äù', 'Alcaraz was in a spot of bother, though, before Musetti‚Äôs movement became too hampered for the match to be competitive. The 21-year-old had to dig deep and raise his level in the key second-set tiebreak. Musetti was looking confident and enjoying his first French Open semi-final, with Alcaraz growing frustrated and desperately needing to snap himself into focus.', 'He managed, and now awaits a blockbuster of a final against Sinner. The Spaniard will have time to go through his recovery before watching on TV tonight. ""Of course I\'ll watch it, I‚Äôm not gonna miss it. It\'s one of the best matches we can have in tennis at the moment,‚Äù Alcaraz smiled. ‚ÄúI\'m gonna watch and enjoy. I‚Äôm a big tennis fan, it‚Äôll be a great match.‚Äù', ""At one stage, it looked as if Alcaraz and Musetti were heading the distance, potentially delaying the later battle between the 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic and the World No 1. ‚ÄúThe first two sets were really tough. I had chances to break his serve in the match and I couldn't make the most of it,‚Äù Alcaraz said. ‚ÄúHe was playing great tennis. When I won the second set there was relief.‚Äù"", 'It was hardly a violent explosion of anger, but Alcaraz seemed to wake up after kicking his bench in frustration when Musetti won an entertaining net exchange to lead 4-3 in the second. Musetti had resisted Alcaraz and was there to guide a volley down the line after the Spaniard had opened his legs for the tweener. It‚Äôs the sort of fun point that Alcaraz plays for, but Musetti was winning too many of them.', 'In the tiebreak, however, Alcaraz stepped it up, winning the first three points and then pushing Musetti deep into his backhand corner before landing a drop shot that tickled the net-cord on the way over. Alcaraz held up his racket in a gesture of apology but was ruthless in closing out the tiebreak and then instantly stamped his authority over Musetti in the third.', 'The Italian barely won a point, and the source of his troubles were revealed after calling a physio at the end of the fifth game to receive treatment on his left leg. But Alcaraz had won 24 of the 30 points to win the bagel set, returning with new-found aggression and whipping his forehand with devastation. Musetti, though, hardly moved as Alcaraz aimed his backhand return past him on set point.', '‚ÄúIn the third set, I knew what I had to do in the beginning, pushing him to the limit and trying to be aggressive,‚Äù Alcaraz said. ""I was more calm and I could see this more clear and I could play great tennis. It‚Äôs not great getting through or winning the match like this [with Musetti retiring]. Lorenzo is a great player and I wish him all the best and a quick recovery.‚Äù', 'Musetti had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, including two this clay-court season in the Monte Carlo final and Rome semi-final, but the 23-year-old produced an impressive level and felt his performance over the first two sets was his best showing against the Spaniard.', ""‚ÄúThat's a step forward,‚Äù Musetti said. ‚ÄúThe last two matches were a little bit, you know, one way. I felt that today I had my chances even to try to go two sets up, but of course Carlos, he's playing really well. He's in really great shape. He deserves to go in the final.‚Äù"", 'Alcaraz got to put his feet up while Djokovic and Sinner met for the chance to face him. The Spaniard has now won 13 consecutive matches at the French Open and will bid for a second Roland Garros title on Sunday, either against the best player in the world or the most successful men‚Äôs player of all time.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWZaVWN0U25ZNFpHbDRRVEo1VFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhQkVJNnRFUXM=-w280-h168-p-df

It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù', 'The pair go from sideline to sideline, Sinner winning the first point of the tiebreak after Djokovic sends an attempted winner wide. The Italian peppers the corners ruthlessly, clinching the second point after Djokovic scoops one long.

Sinner allows Djokovic back into it, however, with two wayward shots to make it 3-2.', 'Sinner unleashes an explosive forehand which sends Djokovic into no man‚Äôs land for 4-2. He follows up with a huge serve which Djokovic is unable to return. On serve, Djokovic sends a loose shot long for 6-2. Sinner squanders his first match point, but not his second. He will face Carlos Alcaraz in the final. He still hasn‚Äôt dropped a set but, even so, that was a titanic contest.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 7-5, 6-6 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner starts with an ace.

Sinner follows up with a sliding forehand which leaves Djokovic standing like a statue. The next rally ends with Sinner finding the net, before Djokovic lashes one down the line. The Serb wraps up with a firework of an ace. We‚Äôve passed the three-hour mark. Drink, anyone?', 'Sinner* 6-4, 7-5, 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner seems to lose concentration momentarily, dropping two points in quick succession. The crowd roars in response, not least those frantically waving Serbia flags. Sinner pulls one back, but Djokovic earns two break points after his opponent flubs one long. Sinner defends the first. He defends the second. Now it‚Äôs time for his fans to roar.', 'Djokovic seizes another break point, an exchange of angled cross-court shots ending with Sinner blasting wide. Djokovic goes for a winner down the line, but fluffs it. He ends up in a heated exchange with the umpire after his next tracer down the line is called out by millimetres, but he drags it back to deuce. Sinner keeps his cool to finally clinch the hold. That was the best game so far.', 'Sinner 6-4, 7-5, 4-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Djokovic kicks things off with a drop shot which leaves Sinner skidding helplessly across the clay. The pair then trade points, Djokovic slightly overdoing a blast to the baseline.

Djokovic clinches the hold with a crunching serve which Sinner has no hope of returning.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 7-5, 4-4 Djokovic (*denotes server) Morale never seems to remain boosted for long against Sinner.

Djokovic isn‚Äôt done yet, though, holding serve and producing one enormous ace in the process.', 'Djokovic is ready to continue. He has zero margin for error if he intends to earn a place in the final against all odds.', 'Djokovic is now taking a medical timeout, with the physio seemingly working on his left thigh.', 'This time, despite Djokovic taking the game to deuce, Sinner does the business. Djokovic upped his level in the second set, but the outcome was ultimately the same. Sinner still hasn‚Äôt dropped a set at Roland Garros this year. Djokovic has dwindling opportunities to change that.', 'Djokovic takes a break to consult the physio. He‚Äôs been stretching off his leg, looking uncomfortable, for much of the second set.', 'Sinner 6-4, 6-5 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Sinner tries to wrest back the momentum, winning the first point, but Djokovic skims the lines with a couple of beautiful winners to make it 30-15. Sinner sends one long, but earns another point with a ruthless forehand having dragged Djokovic out of position. Djokovic attempts another audacious drop shot, but it skews wide to take the game to deuce. Djokovic cedes and defends break point, but coughs up another and, after sending his opponent scrambling desperately across the court, Sinner breaks back immediately with an emphatic smash.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 5-5 Djokovic (*denotes server) Well, well, well. Djokovic shows there‚Äôs a sting in the tail, knocking Sinner off his stride to earn two break points. Sinner defends the first, but can‚Äôt repeat the trick. Djokovic clenches his fist in defiant celebration.', 'Sinner 6-4, 5-4 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Djokovic may be in trouble but he isn‚Äôt planning to go quietly. He battles through his service game to hold, leaving Sinner to serve for the second set.', 'Sinner* 6-4, 5-3 Djokovic (*denotes server) Djokovic looks understandably deflated, his accuracy waning as he fails to mount a challenge to Sinner‚Äôs serve. The Italian drops one point on his way to a comfortable hold, producing another superb drop shot winner along the way.', 'Sinner 6-4, 4-3 Djokovic* (*denotes server) Sinner makes life difficult for Djokovic with a vicious return, but the Serb wins the opening rally with an unstoppable shot that kisses the line. Sinner hits back, forcing his opponent into a shot which drifts long. Sinner makes it 30-15 with a fizzing forehand, but Djokovic drags it back to 30-30.

Sinner lets him off with a couple of returns which go just long. At 30-30, Djokovic tries to pull off a tricky drop shot which tumbles into the net.

He‚Äôs steadied the ship, for now at least.', 'Sinner* 4-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner looks far more relaxed than his rival, Djokovic throwing out his hands in frustration after losing the opening point. Sinner‚Äôs serve is just too powerful at the moment. Again, he holds to love. That‚Äôs six points in a row now.', 'Sinner 3-2 Djokovic* (*denotes server) A high-tempo opening rally ends with Djokovic skewing another attempted drop shot into the net. He then showcases the power of his serve, splitting the court in two with a thunderous ace. Sinner drags him about the court in the next rally to pull ahead again.

The bottom half, predictable (but not boring). Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have cruised into the semifinals, while Lorenzo Musetti and Novak Djokovic now stand in their way. The storylines are clear: Sinner‚Äôs stamina, Musetti‚Äôs nerves, Djokovic‚Äôs legs, and Alcaraz‚Äôs momentum. The odds say we‚Äôre heading toward the final everyone predicted. But Roland-Garros has a way of flipping the script‚Äîespecially when one player cracks.', 'Credit: X', 'Carlos Alcaraz enters this semifinal as a massive favorite‚Äîand the numbers back it up. He leads Musetti 6‚Äì1 in their head-to-head, with a 3‚Äì0 record on clay. But Musetti‚Äôs not just some filler opponent. He‚Äôs made the semis at Monte Carlo, Madrid, and Rome this season. Nobody else on tour has done that. This is the most consistent clay run of his career.', 'Credit: Instagram', 'The bigger issue isn‚Äôt Musetti‚Äôs strokes‚Äîit‚Äôs his nerves. In the 2024 Rome semifinal against Alcaraz, Musetti never looked like he believed he could win. He got tight, rushed shots, and faded in the tiebreak. If that version of him shows up again, this match is over before it starts. If he plays free, it‚Äôs a different story.', 'Credit: Instagram', 'Musetti has only held serve 60% of the time against Alcaraz on clay. Alcaraz, meanwhile, has broken him in nearly half the return games they‚Äôve played. But zoom out to clay performance overall this season, and things get tighter: both players have near-identical service+return point totals (Alcaraz 111, Musetti 108). That‚Äôs not a mismatch‚Äîit‚Äôs a mental hurdle.', 'Credit: Instagram', 'Musetti thrives in slower night sessions. This match? It‚Äôs first on, 2:30 p.m. local time, under dry, breezy daytime conditions. Faster courts plus gusty winds will give Alcaraz‚Äôs forehand more bite‚Äîand give Musetti less time to set up his defensive patterns. It‚Äôs not unplayable, but it‚Äôs far from ideal.', 'Credit: X', 'Alcaraz has dropped just one set this tournament. Musetti‚Äôs not expected to win, but if he settles into rhythm, a 3‚Äì1 scoreline feels likely. At -106, the over 34.5 games total is one of the sharper bets on the board. This could be a long match without ever being close to an upset.', 'Credit: Facebook', 'Jannik Sinner hasn‚Äôt dropped a set all tournament. He‚Äôs looked clinical, dominant, even bored. But Novak Djokovic is the first top-tier opponent he‚Äôs faced. It‚Äôs the matchup everyone expected‚Äîand now we‚Äôll find out if Sinner‚Äôs physicality can hold up over five sets on clay.', 'Credit: Instagram', 'Against Zverev, Djokovic showed flashes of brilliance. He hit drop shots, attacked the net, and punished passive play. But he also looked tired at the end of Set 4. He‚Äôs 38. He hasn‚Äôt played a five-set match in nearly a year. If Sinner drags this out, it‚Äôs a survival test‚Äînot a shootout.', 'Credit: Facebook', 'There‚Äôs no backup plan. Sinner hits a heavy, flat ball, keeps opponents off balance, and dominates on serve. In his last three matches vs. Djokovic, he‚Äôs held serve 95% of the time. He‚Äôs not here to grind points. He‚Äôs here to blow through them‚Äîand Djokovic knows it.', 'Credit: Facebook', 'The bookmakers have Sinner as a -455 favorite. But Djokovic‚Äôs form and fight deserve respect. A 3‚Äì1 Sinner win pays out at +250 and hits the sweet spot: Djokovic gets a set (likely early), Sinner wears him down, and the final two sets pull away. It‚Äôs a bet that acknowledges Djokovic‚Äôs pedigree‚Äîbut respects the pace Sinner‚Äôs bringing.', 'Credit: X', 'At the start of this tournament, most serious bettors had one final in mind: Alcaraz vs. Sinner. After two weeks of dominance, nothing has changed. Both men are peaking at the right time. Musetti might test Alcaraz‚Äôs patience. Djokovic might test Sinner‚Äôs nerves.

Carlos Alcaraz returns to French Open final after Lorenzo Musetti retires hurt,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/06/carlos-alcaraz-battles-past-lorenzo-musetti-to-reach-french-open-final,"['Musetti took first set but fell 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 behind', 'Alcaraz reaches second consecutive Roland Garros final', 'Carlos Alcaraz continued his imperious march through the clay-court season as he reached his second consecutive French Open final by defeating Lorenzo Musetti, the eighth seed, who was forced to retire with a left thigh injury while Alcaraz led 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0.', 'After a difficult start to the year, the 22-year-old has found his way in a clay-court season that has yielded Masters 1000 titles in Monte Carlo and Rome. He will now attempt to become the third man this century, after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal, to retain the French Open. Alcaraz, the second seed in Paris, is also the fifth-youngest man in the open era to reach five grand slam finals and he will attempt to extend his record to winning all of them. He has won 21 matches and lost once on clay this year.', 'Alcaraz will face either Jannik Sinner, the world No 1, or the 24-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic in the final. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to miss it,‚Äù said Alcaraz of the second semi-final. ‚ÄúThis match is one of the best match-ups we have in tennis right now, Sinner against Djokovic. It‚Äôs going to be great tennis. As a huge fan of tennis, I‚Äôm going to watch it, I‚Äôm going to enjoy it. Of course, I‚Äôm going to take tactics from the match.‚Äù', 'Although the Spaniard was in the favourable half of the draw, away from Novak Djokovic and others, Musetti has established himself as one of the toughest opponents in the sport. The pair have spent much of their young lives competing against each other after coming up through the junior circuit together. Although the 23-year-old Musetti enjoyed a greater junior career, Alcaraz established himself at the top of the sport faster than most players in history. Over the past year, the Italian has finally made a significant leap forward.', 'Last year he reached his first grand slam semi-final at Wimbledon and won an Olympic bronze medal at Roland Garros. He followed those breakthrough results with a remarkable clay-court season this year, reaching his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo and then rolling to the semi-finals in Madrid and Rome. After playing and winning so many matches recently, the physical challenge presented by Alcaraz proved a step too far.', 'In this era of rigid, one-note baseliners, Musetti‚Äôs style is as distinct as Alcaraz‚Äôs. He peppers opponents with his variety of shots, including backhand slices, drop shots, net forays, and a sweet single-handed backhand. He is also a brilliant athlete and one of the very best movers. The two players‚Äô shared creativity made for a wonderful spectacle for two and a half sets on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where no two shots either man struck were the same.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The confidence and momentum Musetti has built in recent weeks was immediately evident. He started the match playing fearless, varied tennis, serving well, attacking his forehand and searching for opportunities to close down the net. He outsmarted and outmanoeuvred Alcaraz, who prides himself on his ability to disrupt his opponents, throughout the opening set.', 'Alcaraz had to be patient as he tried to turn the match around. He failed to consolidate his early break in set two, immediately handing the break back, then he also failed to serve out the set at 6-5. While he lost his focus on key points, he also had to accept that his opponent‚Äôs stellar level caused much of his misfortune. Despite his issues, Alcaraz saved his best stretch of tennis for the most critical point of the match, blazing through a brilliant tie-break to take the second set.', 'With that, Alcaraz opened his shoulders and began to consistently impose his greater weight of shot. He grew in confidence behind his serve and struck his forehand spectacularly from then on, tearing apart Musetti‚Äôs brilliant defence. ‚ÄúHe was playing great tennis,‚Äù said Alcaraz. ‚ÄúWhen I won the second set, it was a little bit of a relief. In the third set, I knew what I had to do, just to push him to the limit. Just trying to be aggressive, not let him dominate the game and just being myself. I was more calm, I could see things more clearly and I played great tennis at the beginning of the third set.‚Äù', 'However, as Alcaraz gained momentum in the third set, Musetti gradually began to slow down. Down 5-0, the match falling away from him, the Italian received a medical timeout for his left thigh. He lasted only three more games before he decided he could no longer continue.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWZaVWN0U25ZNFpHbDRRVEo1VFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdhQkVJNnRFUXM=-w280-h168-p-df

While Alcaraz ranks first on clay, per Tennis Abstract's Elo ratings, Musetti comes in at fourth behind only him, Sinner, and Novak Djokovic."", ""Musetti didn't earn any titles this clay season, but he went 14-3 with a run to the Monte Carlo final and the semis at both Madrid and Rome. However, two of those three losses came at the hands of none other than Alcaraz, and he's just 1-5 all time against the Spaniard."", ""That being said, we can find some positives for Musetti despite the lopsided head-to-head. In their four clay matches, three went to a deciding third set (one of which the Italian won), and in the most recent one that didn't, Musetti at least pushed Alcaraz to a second-set tiebreak."", ""Further, it's worth noting that despite his brilliance, Carlos has dropped a set in three of his last four matches here, and those three went 32, 36, and 42 total games. None of his opponents in those matches ranked inside the top 25 in Tennis Abstract's clay rankings. And while he did get a straight-sets win over Tommy Paul in the quarterfinals, Paul was compromised due to injury."", 'Musetti should be able to steal a set in this one, and if that comes to pass, this match has a great chance of going over 35.5 games. His last three matches have all gone over this number (37, 38, and 38), as well.', ""Djokovic proved in the last round against Alexander Zverev that even at 38 years old, he's still practically automatic in majors against anyone not named Sinner or Alcaraz. However, he now faces one of those young rivals in these semifinals."", ""Sinner may be taking on the GOAT, but in the year 2025, he's a -480 favorite against Djokovic. Jannik has won four of his last five matches against Novak and three in a row."", ""However, they haven't faced each other on clay since their first meeting way back in 2021 -- which Djokovic won easily -- and the two are separated by only 15 points in Tennis Abstract's clay Elo rankings. For all of Sinner's accomplishments at 23 years old, just one of his 19 titles have come on clay (2022 Umag), and that was an ATP 250 tournament."", ""This isn't to say we should expect a Djokovic victory -- Massey Ratings projects a 68% win probability for the Italian -- but this at least looks like a surface where Novak can give the world No. 1 some trouble. Even when the two last faced each other at a Grand Slam (2024 Australian Open) on Sinner's best surface, Djokovic managed to push him to 37 total match games."", ""Sinner has looked just about flawless through five matches with zero dropped sets, but Djokovic has lost only one set himself. Following Novak's impressive victory over Zverev, he should be game to go at least four sets with Sinner, giving us a clear path to the over."", ""And while I'm not sure Djokovic can do enough to ultimately topple Sinner at the finish line, +360 is an intriguing price for him to win straight up.

This slate is too big for a single ‚ÄúPick of the Day‚Äù‚Äîlet‚Äôs break down both matches from a betting perspective.', 'Alcaraz is 5-1 over Musetti, including two wins on clay this season. Both times, Alcaraz looked comfortable, and he‚Äôs coming off a dominant performance against Tommy Paul, dropping just five games and winning an incredible 48 of 55 service points. Given that, it‚Äôs easy to see why many expect Alcaraz to roll into the Roland Garros final.', ""But tennis isn‚Äôt that simple. Players aren‚Äôt defined by their last match, and Alcaraz has shown some inconsistency this tournament, dropping sets to Fabian Marozsan, Damir Dzumhur and Ben Shelton. Any lapses against Musetti could prove costly, especially since the Italian has become one of the best clay-courters on tour. He's made deep runs at all the big clay events this year, and took a set off Alcaraz in Monte Carlo before an injury slowed him down. He was also up a break in the second set in Rome, but he lost his focus serving at 4-3 to give it back."", 'Musetti‚Äôs game is built to frustrate. He‚Äôs an elite returner, and great at mixing up spins and playing sharp angles. He‚Äôs also relentless when it comes to defending the baseline. That can really make his opponents work. And if Alcaraz gets sloppy, Musetti will pounce on his mistakes.

Instead, I‚Äôm going with Over 3.5 sets‚Äîpretty much the same play, unless you think Djokovic sweeps Sinner, which feels unlikely. I‚Äôm not going big with this one (since I already have futures on both Sinner and Djokovic to win the tournament, meaning I‚Äôm covered either way), but this is a play I feel confident in.', ""Sinner comes in as a heavy favorite and hasn‚Äôt dropped a set all tournament. He‚Äôs the world No. 1 and has beaten Djokovic the last three times they‚Äôve played. Still, Sinner hasn‚Äôt won a clay title in years‚Äîan ATP 250 in Umag, in 2022‚Äîand clay is where he looks least comfortable moving around the court. Djokovic, meanwhile, is a master tactician and just pulled off a gritty win over Alexander Zverev, using dropshots to keep the German off balance. I expect him to go to that same shot a lot against Sinner, who is still a bit questionable when it comes to fitness. I also think we‚Äôll see plenty of serve-and-volley from Djokovic, whose slider out wide is one of the biggest cheat codes in tennis. He'll go to that pretty much every time there's a big point on the deuce side."", '>>> READ MORE: ‚ÄúHe is back to the level,‚Äù says Jannik of throwback Novak', 'Djokovic‚Äôs experience and mental toughness in best-of-five-set matches can‚Äôt be ignored, especially if Sinner‚Äôs fitness wavers.
