ENTs occur when stars more than three times the weight of the Sun get too close to a supermassive black hole. In response, the black hole slowly drains the life out of the star, creating a bright, energy surge unlike anything we’ve ever observed before.', '“We’ve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts, reaching brightnesses nearly ten times more than what we typically see,” said Jason Hinkle, who led the study, in a press release. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'The amount of energy and brightness emitted by ENTs is unusual and unequaled in the history of the cosmos.

Supernovae are extraordinary phenomena, with each explosion emitting the same amount of energy in one year as our Sun does in its entire lifetime.

As we know, black holes are able to grow thanks to their voracious consumption of matter — a process called accretion. ', 'After looking at the massive energy budget of ENTs and their distinct appearance, astronomers were able to land on accretion to explain what was happening between the star and the supermassive black hole.

It does not explode, not in the conventional sense. Instead, it unravels — shredded by tidal forces, stretched into a stream of stellar debris, and fed to the black hole like spaghetti into a maw. As this cosmic banquet begins, a brilliant flare of light ignites, bright enough to pierce billions of light-years of darkness. It persists not for seconds or hours, but for years.', 'Move over, supernovae. Astronomers call these phenomena Extreme Nuclear Transients, or ENTs. And they are, quite simply, the most energetic single events the universe has ever shown us since the Big Bang.', '“We’ve observed stars getting ripped apart as tidal disruption events for over a decade, but these ENTs are different beasts,” said Jason Hinkle, the University of Hawaiʻi astronomer who led the discovery. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'The research team first spotted signs of ENTs while combing through public data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission. Hinkle noticed two mysterious flares, Gaia16aaw and Gaia18cdj, that didn’t fit any known pattern. Their light curves were smooth and brightened gradually, standing in stark contrast to the erratic flickers of typical black hole outbursts or the sudden flashes of supernovae.', 'Then came the kicker. A third event, AT2021lwx, was detected independently by the Zwicky Transient Facility. It too shone with a quiet, persistent intensity. “When I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies,” Hinkle said, “I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'The brightness was just the beginning. These events weren’t just unusual—they were off the cosmic charts. The most luminous of the group, Gaia18cdj, released 2.5 × 10⁵³ ergs of energy — 25 times more than the most powerful known supernovae. For comparison, our Sun will produce just one ten-billionth of that energy over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.', 'These were no ordinary explosions. Supernovae couldn’t explain the observations. Neither could the chaotic feeding habits of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where black holes devour surrounding material.

The debris forms a temporary disk around the black hole, slowly falling inward and heating up to extreme temperatures. This process releases a sustained blaze of radiation — one that can outshine entire galaxies for months or years.', 'To confirm this scenario, Hinkle and his team launched a years-long observational campaign using facilities including the W. M. Keck Observatory and NASA’s Swift satellite. They tracked each ENT across the electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to infrared.', 'The ENTs’ spectra glowed with hot, blue light and broad hydrogen lines, both hallmarks of high-energy accretion onto a black hole. Their blackbody temperatures hovered around 15,000 Kelvin, consistent with models of tidal disruption. And their host galaxies, located at redshifts near 1, placed the events around 7 to 8 billion years in the past — an epoch when star formation and black hole growth were both at their peak.', '“ENTs provide a valuable new tool for studying massive black holes in distant galaxies,” said co-author Benjamin Shappee. “Because they’re so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances — and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time.”', 'But, even in a sky filled with telescopes, ENTs are vanishingly rare.', 'The study estimates their rate at about one per thousand cubic gigaparsecs per year — a volume equivalent to roughly 30 million Milky Way-sized galaxies. That’s 10,000 times rarer than ordinary supernovae.', 'Their scarcity isn’t surprising. For an ENT to occur, a rare set of cosmic coincidences must align. A massive star must exist in the central region of a galaxy, a supermassive black hole must be present, and the star must drift close enough to be destroyed — but not swallowed whole.', 'Even then, many ENTs may go unseen. Their dust-shrouded environments may obscure the flare in visible light, and some events may fail to trigger standard detection algorithms. In fact, Gaia itself missed AT2021lwx — likely due to interference from a bright nearby star.', 'These violent deaths offer more than a fireworks show. They illuminate the invisible. Because ENTs trace interactions between stars and black holes, they open a new window into the mysterious lives of supermassive black holes in distant galaxies — especially those that lie dormant most of the time.', 'They also push the boundaries of known physics. The sheer energy of ENTs rules out many mechanisms, from radioactive decay in supernovae to spinning magnetars or dense clumps of stellar debris.', '“No stellar explosion model can account for what we’re seeing,” the authors write. Instead, ENTs belong to a new — and extreme — frontier of astrophysics.', '“These ENTs don’t just mark the dramatic end of a massive star’s life,” Hinkle said. “They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe.”', 'Astronomers have just discovered them, but the future of ENT discovery already looks promising. Two next-generation observatories — the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile and NASA’s Roman Space Telescope — are expected to dramatically improve the odds of spotting these rare events. Their wide-field surveys and infrared sensitivity could reveal ENTs from the early universe, as far back as 12 billion years ago.', 'If so, these cataclysms could become cosmic signposts — blinking beacons that map the rise of supermassive black holes across time and space.', 'For now, though, the ENTs remain exceptional and few.', 'The findings appeared in the journal Science Advances.', '', '', 'Tibi is a science journalist and co-founder of ZME Science.

Stars burn like celestial nuclear fusion reactors, quasars emit thousands of times the luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy, and asteroids slam into planets. But all of these pale in comparison to a new class of events discovered by researchers at the University of Hawai’i’s Institute for Astronomy (IfA). According to their findings published June 4 in the journal Science Advances, it’s time to classify the universe’s most energetic explosions as extreme nuclear transients–or ENTs.', 'ENTs are as devastating as they are rare. They only occur when a massive star at least three times heavier than the sun drifts too close to a supermassive black hole. The colliding forces subsequently obliterate the star, sending out plumes of energy across huge swaths of space. Similar events known as tidal disruption events (TDEs) are known to occur on a (comparatively) smaller scale, and have been documented for over a decade. But ENTs are something else entirely.', '“ENTs are different beasts,” study lead author and astronomer Jason Hinkle explained in an accompanying statement. “Not only are ENTs far brighter than normal tidal disruption events, but they remain luminous for years, far surpassing the energy output of even the brightest known supernova explosions.”', 'Hinkle was first tipped off to ENTs while looking into transients—longlasting flares that spew energy from a galaxy’s center. Two particularly strange examples captured by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission caught his eye. The pair of events brightened over a much longer timeframe than previously documented transients, but lacked some of their usual characteristics.', '“Gaia doesn’t tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in brightness,” Hinkle said. “But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'Hinkle soon reached out to observatory teams around the world for what would become a multiyear project to understand these anomalies. In the process, a third suspect was detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego. After months of analysis, Hinkle and collaborators realized they were witnessing something unprecedented.', 'The ENTs analyzed by astronomers displayed smoother, longer lasting flares that pointed towards something very particular—a supermassive black hole accreting a giant, wayward star.', 'This contrasts with a more standard black hole that typically acquires its material and energy unpredictably, resulting in irregular brightness fluctuations.', 'The energy and luminosity of an ENT boggles the mind. The most powerful ENT documented in Hinkle’s study, Gaia18cdj, generated 25 times more energy than the most powerful known supernovae. For reference, a standard supernova puts out as much energy in a single year as the sun does across its entire 10 billion year lifespan. Gaia18cdj, meanwhile, manages to give off 100 suns’ worth of energy over just 12 months.', 'The implications of ENTs and their massive energy surges go far beyond their impressive energy outputs. Astronomers believe they contribute to some of the most pivotal events in the cosmos.', '“These ENTs don’t just mark the dramatic end of a massive star’s life. They illuminate the processes responsible for growing the largest black holes in the universe,” said Hinkle.', 'From here on Earth, ENTs can also help researchers as they continue studying massive, distant black holes.', '“Because they’re so bright, we can see them across vast cosmic distances—and in astronomy, looking far away means looking back in time,” explained study co-author and astronomer Benjamin Shappee. “By observing these prolonged flares, we gain insights into black hole growth when the universe was half its current age… forming stars and feeding their supermassive black holes 10 times more vigorously than they do today.”', 'There’s a catch for astronomers, however. While supernovae are relatively well-documented, ENTs are estimated to occur at least 10 million times less often.

In just one year, it radiated energy equal to the lifetime output of 100 Suns. Most supernovae, in comparison, produce only one Sun’s lifetime output over a similar timescale.', 'Hinkle first spotted the strange flares while combing through publicly available data from the Gaia space telescope. Unlike more common cosmic explosions that fade over several weeks, ENTs glow steadily for years.', '“Gaia observations don’t tell you what a transient is, just that something changed in how bright it appears to us,” said Hinkle. “But when I saw these smooth, long-lived flares from the centers of distant galaxies, I knew we were looking at something unusual.”', 'Hinkle used years of observations from UH’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System with telescopes on Haleakalā and Mauna Loa, the W.
