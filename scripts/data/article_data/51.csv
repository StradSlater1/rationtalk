NCAA settlement, which will allow schools around the country to directly pay student-athletes through revenue sharing beginning July 1.', 'The settlement is a landmark change in college athletics and one that CU is ready to embrace.', '“We’re all in,” CU athletic director Rick George told BuffZone in a recent interview. “We’re going to be all in, and this is going to be a group effort. … We’re going to be very aggressive, going out and looking at revenue streams, and obviously our donations that we get from donors is an area that we’re going to emphasize.”', 'Schools can pay student-athletes up to $20.5 million during the 2025-26 school year, to be divided among different sports. It’s widely expected that football and men’s basketball teams – the two sports that generate the most revenue – will receive most of that money.', 'While schools don’t have to reach the cap (which is expected to increase every year), George said CU plans to hit the cap. George and his administrative team have been working for nearly a year to be ready for the July 1 start date, including how to earn the money and how to allocate the funds. CU is still figuring out a plan of how to allocate money to different sports.', '“It’s a challenging time for our peers and for us, because you just don’t have $20.5 million lying around,” George said. “So it’s going to require some difficult decisions and we’ve just got to be willing to make them. But our goal in all of this is that we want to compete at the highest level, so we’re going to participate at the highest level.”', 'CU has already made some decisions, including installing artificial turf at Folsom Field this summer, which carries an upfront cost of about $1 million, but will allow CU to host more concerts at the stadium and generate revenue. Also, BuffZone reported last week that CU is eliminating the positions of long-time track and field coaches Casey and Lindsey Malone, as the Buffs plan to focus more on their distance programs going forward.', '“It requires a lot, and it’s going to require us to manage our expenses,” George said. “It’s going to require us to generate more revenue. You just don’t, in a year’s time, figure out how you can be able to revenue share at that number.', '“It’s going to be incumbent on our base out there, our Flatiron Society, our Buff Club donors, to get involved. And I think we’re showing them our commitment. I feel really strongly that for us to be in a great position three to five years from now, we need to participate at the highest level, and we need to make sure that it’s sustainable. I feel like we’ve got a good plan in place.”', 'While George acknowledges there will have to be some expense cuts, he said generating more revenue, through donors, outside events, etc., will be the priority. And, he maintained, as he has throughout his tenure at CU, that he does not want to cut from the programs that benefit the student-athletes.', '“One thing that I’ve told our student athletes and I’ve told our coaches is we will continue to provide the great benefits for our student-athletes that we always have, and that’s in the areas of mental health, nutrition, sports medicine, strength and conditioning, academic support, all those things that touch our student athletes,” he said. “We’re going to make sure that we still maintain those at a very high level.”', 'In addition to revenue sharing, a big piece of the House settlement is roster limits.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df
Montlake Futures hands NIL reins to UW athletics after House settlement,https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/montlake-futures-hands-nil-reins-to-uw-athletics-after-house-settlement/,"['Andrew Minear can finally take a few moments to breathe. It’s been nearly three years since he’d been able to say that truthfully. ', 'Minear took over as the executive director of Montlake Futures, UW’s official third-party name image and likeness (NIL) collective, in October 2022. It was his responsibility to guide Washington’s collective through the unregulated world of NIL. To ensure Michael Penix Jr. and Rome Odunze and Troy Fautanu and Bralen Trice returned for a final season. To help coach Jedd Fisch assemble UW’s first Big Ten roster. ', 'All while the NIL landscape was constantly shifting under his feet. Now, Minear can rest. ', '“As Montlake Futures,” he said, “we are not going to be at the forefront any longer.”', 'College athletics entered a new era Friday when U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken granted her final approval for the NCAA’s settlement of three antitrust lawsuits, collectively called the House settlement, to pave the way for universities to share revenue directly with student-athletes, among several other stipulations. ', 'Dawgs Unleashed, an internal NIL and influencer marketing division designed to connect UW student-athletes with corporate sponsorship opportunities, is a major part of Washington’s response to the settlement. Montlake Futures, which has operated outside of the athletic department since its founding in 2021, will begin relinquishing its NIL responsibilities to Dawgs Unleashed, Minear said.  ', '“We’ve said all along that our purpose was to be in service to the university and their athletes,” Minear said. “We were going to do it the Washington way. The right way.”', 'Montlake Futures won’t completely disappear. The company will continue fulfilling its active contracts with UW student-athletes through their completion date. ', 'However, Minear made it clear that Montlake Futures hopes its supporters will donate solely to the UW athletic department, which can directly share up to $20.5 million with student-athletes starting July 1. ', '“For now, the majority of that work is in the court of UW athletics,” Minear said. “We’re going to encourage everyone to go there and support the Dawgs like they’ve supported us.”', 'Minear, a former senior director of regional advancement at UW, said he’s proud of the work Montlake Futures did during his tenure. The collective consisted of only two employees — Minear and Henry McRae, a partnership and student-athlete development manager — for a majority of its existence. But it was able to build a membership base of more than 1,000 donors and provide NIL opportunities for student-athletes on several different teams including football, men’s and women’s basketball and softball. ', 'He credited the guidance of Montlake Futures lead adviser Pete Shimer and board members Gerald Swanson, Tiffany Girouard, Mindy Blakeslee and Fanny Green for helping the collective build success. ', 'Minear was particularly glad he was able to find charitable ways for UW student-athletes to contribute to the greater community while also earning their compensation. ', 'A majority of the contributions Montlake Futures received were charitable donations, so Minear, who spent more than 17 years as a senior vice president and chief development officer for the YMCA of Greater Seattle, devised a strategy to pay UW student-athletes for their NIL rights to promote local charities like Seattle Children’s, Seattle Humane, Treehouse and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. ', 'The settlement will fundamentally change this approach. Fans and donors can now get money directly to student-athletes by contributing directly to the athletic department. Minear said UW’s Go Big campaign was one option for current Montlake Futures donors to continue supporting Husky athletics. ', 'Additionally, the settlement’s approval created the College Sports Commission, a non-NCAA entity charged with ensuring teams stay under the revenue-share cap, and NIL Go, a Deloitte-run clearinghouse tasked with approving all NIL deals worth more than $600. Combined, they make corporate sponsorship the focus of NIL. ', 'It’s something Minear admitted Montlake Futures wasn’t built to handle. The NIL collective primarily dealt with boosters and casual donors. Their limited staff, he said, meant it was challenging to build relationships in the Seattle business community that eventually lead to corporate sponsorships. Montlake Futures was often starting from scratch. ', 'Dawgs Unleashed, as an internal division of the UW athletics department, already has many of those connections, he said. Minear added Dawgs Unleashed can also offer higher-quality assets and can easily include UW trademarks like the logos or wordmarks. ', 'While Dawgs Unleashed picks up where Montlake Futures left, the third-party collective’s future is less clear. Minear and Dawgs Unleashed executive director Joe Knight said there are ongoing discussions about how Montake Futures’ position as a third-party entity can help the athletic department going forward.', 'Yet Minear, for the first time in a long time, doesn’t have to worry about the distant future. ', '“We feel pretty good about what we did,” he said. “We’re just going to continue to encourage our donors and fans to love Husky athletics and support them the best they can so we can continue to be dominant in all of our sports.”', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df
COLLEGES PREP FOR ATHLETE TITLE IX LAWSUITS OF THE REVENUE-SHARE ERA,https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2025/colleges-budget-title-ix-lawsuits-revenue-sharing-1234855457/,"['Well before Judge Claudia Wilken granted approval last Friday of an antitrust settlement between athletes, the NCAA and power conferences, universities were already girding for the next legal war—one that threatens to hit much closer to home.', 'With the revenue-sharing era now officially underway,\nTitle IX\ndefense attorneys say colleges are preparing for a potential wave of gender-equity lawsuits from athletes, especially challenges over how that revenue is distributed. These preparations, months in the making, include budgeting for costly and prolonged litigation—and potential settlements with classes of athletes—as well as commissioning audits to identify other areas of Title IX vulnerability.', 'Just how intense—or costly—this next chapter will be remains uncertain, given the unprecedented legal landscape. However, lawyers say several institutions are preparing litigation reserves on par with the maximum revenue-sharing pools stipulated by the\nHouse v. NCAA\nsettlement.', '', 'Todd Shumaker, a sports law and higher education partner at Church Church Hittle and Antrim, told Sportico that some of the FBS schools he advises are allocating anywhere from a few million dollars to $20 million in anticipation. Shumaker says those discussions began around six months ago.', '“They are trying to balance antitrust concerns with Title IX concerns, knowing that even if they are working toward equity, that it is not going to get there right away,” said Shumaker, who previously served on the NCAA’s enforcement staff. “Like a lot of stuff in college sports, it is not if you are going to get sued but when you are going to get sued.”', 'Unlike the House, Carter, and Hubbard cases—consolidated into the settlement and aimed at the NCAA and athletic conferences—a Title IX lawsuit must name the school itself as the defendant, since it is the direct recipient of federal funds. The House settlement resolves the antitrust claims raised in the three cases’ complaints but explicitly can’t resolve claims that were not part of the litigation, a point Wilken underscored in her\norder granting approval\n. That is true of potential claims within the meaning of Title IX, leaving schools without legal protection in that area and opening them up to an entirely new avenue of liability.', 'From a damage control perspective, the least risky approach for a college would be to distribute revenue-sharing funds to athletes in proportion to the demographic composition of the school’s student body. In other words, the money would be shared (more or less) evenly among male and female athletes enrolled in a college where there are a roughly equal number of men and women students. This method would not only diminish the threat of Title IX claims, but it would be procedurally simple, administratively convenient and predictable. ', '', 'But for a number of institutions, there will be competing pressures—especially if rival schools use revenue-sharing to entice recruits with lucrative offers. Some athletic departments will favor directing the bulk of the funds to the most profitable sports, typically football and men’s basketball. That approach would belie the spirit, if not the letter, of Title IX.', 'These are not abstract considerations; plaintiffs in the revenue-sharing era will be able to litigate direct payments, but they are not limited to challenging only that aspect of a new system.', '“Revenue may just be a catalyst to open up the door for looking at Title IX,” said LaKeisha Marsh, who chairs the higher education and college sports practice at Akerman LLP. “If plaintiffs’ counsel can point to some other ongoing (Title IX) issue or disparity that is happening, they will.”', 'With this in mind, Marsh noted that her firm has been retained by multiple schools over the past two years to conduct Title IX risk assessments. These evaluations aim to proactively address potential vulnerabilities before they surface in a civil complaint and potentially attract negative media attention for a school.', 'Another salient factor that could stoke legal action is the current state of the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces federal civil rights laws in schools. In February, the new Trump administration rescinded an OCR\nfact sheet\nissued by the Department of Education in the waning days of Joe Biden’s presidency. The document asserted that payments to athletes—such as NIL deals and revenue-sharing stipends—should be subject to the same gender equity requirements as athletic scholarships.', 'With the Trump administration’s reversal of that guidance—and its broader signal of disinterest in enforcing gender-equity protections unrelated to\ntransgender participation\nin female sports—athletes and their advocates are increasingly likely to turn to their private right of action to address perceived Title IX violations.', '', '“I see it unlikely that sophisticated plaintiffs would look to OCR to potentially resolve this dispute,” said Darren Gibson, a Texas-based higher education attorney at Michael Best & Friedrich.', 'That’s potentially bad news for schools.', '“It is significantly more expensive than if you are just fighting OCR,” Marsh said.', 'One university, Oregon, is already facing an existing Title IX class action lawsuit that includes claims of inequitable treatment related to NIL opportunities and resources. ', '“This is a period of golden opportunities for Title IX enforcement in America,” Title IX plaintiffs\nattorney Arthur Bryant\n, who is suing UO on behalf of former female athletes, told Sportico last month. ', 'However, attorneys interviewed by Sportico said they expect a more selective approach to litigation, rather than a widespread rush of sex discrimination lawsuits, at least early on.', '“That doesn’t mean there won’t be rogue plaintiffs who just file [suits] against a school because they are unhappy, but I would be surprised if there are just hundreds of cases against all universities,” Gibson said. “Rather, I would anticipate a much more targeted approach to seek positive precedent.”', 'Later this month, Gibson is set to present on college sports-related liability at the annual conference of National Association of College and University Attorneys, where Title IX defense is sure to be on attendees’ minds. ', 'The fact that gender-equity claims could be brought against schools that unequally distribute revenue among men and women who play sports does not necessarily mean those cases would succeed. The relationship between Title IX and colleges engaging in revenue-sharing and direct NIL payments is unchartered legal territory. There is no case precedent directly on point, and the first case will be one of first impression.', 'The Biden Department of Education’s fact sheet—which was not a law or a regulation promulgated through agency rule-making—asserted colleges paying athletes for use of their NIL ought to count as athletic financial assistance within the meaning of Title IX. The federal statute governs financial assistance provided by a school to an athlete in connection to their athletic participation. Without playing a sport, a student would of course not receive a share of revenue from their college.', '', 'But revenue-sharing and NIL payments are based on economic activity, namely the commercial value of a sport and the use of athletes’ right of publicity. Think of the difference between reimbursing athletes for the cost of their tuition to take courses versus paying them because they play a sport that nets a lucrative TV deal.', 'The former is directly connected to financial assistance offered by a school for a shared and equal fee—the cost of matriculation at the college—while the latter is less about university financial assistance and more about compensation for services or identity use. Along those lines, broadcasting rights and NIL would not be the same by sport or even athlete. They are individualized concepts that might be outside the scope of Title IX, a law intended to ensure equal treatment from university services in higher ed.', 'Taking that into account—and considering the unique and constantly changing pool of college athlete plaintiffs—many lawyers believe it’s strategically advantageous for schools to litigate these cases rather than settle them quickly.', '“Every year you are going to have a new class of plaintiffs,” Gibson said. “The ongoing nature of the system being created does not lend itself to an early-settlement strategy.”', 'Marsh agreed. “Jumping out of the gate and looking to settle only opens up an institution to seem susceptible for settlement,” she said. “You play this out a little bit, see what courts’ appetites are, see what arguments are being made.”', 'Shumaker, however, said the strategy largely comes down to how a specific school assesses its risk profile.', '“If your exposure is probably more toward that $20 million side of things, because (Title IX compliance) has been a problem for multiple years, you probably want to see how to settle and move on as quickly as possible,” he said. “If it is toward the lower end, and it is pretty close, and you don’t mind pushing back in litigation, then it probably makes sense (to fight).”', '', 'Many schools carry liability insurance, through providers like United Educators (UE), which would likely play some role in defraying the costs of attorneys’ fees and damages related to athlete sex discrimination suits. UE’s\neducators legal liability coverage\n, for example, “typically” protects against claims arising out of Title IX violations, though there are caps to what it will pay out and potential restrictions on what firms schools can hire.', 'A spokesperson for UE did not respond to a request for comment on how a potential surge in Title IX suits might impact its policies.', 'However, it is reasonable to assume that an influx of such cases could influence both the cost of premiums and scope of coverage. The legal fallout from high-profile sexual abuse scandals, such as those at Michigan State involving former sports doctor Larry Nassar, and Penn State involving former football assistant Jerry Sandusky, are instructive in showing how complex legal disputes can arise between institutions and their insurers.', 'In 2018, after striking a $500 million settlement with Nassar’s victims, Michigan State filed a lawsuit in state court against 13 of its insurance carriers, including United Educators, seeking to recover at least $300 million. The legal battle concluded with UE agreeing to pay $90 million, while several other\ninsurers settled\nfor seven-figure amounts.', 'With its future coverage options limited, Michigan State created a captive insurance company, Lysander Series, to provide general liability coverage. Similarly, other universities, such as Cal and Ohio State, have established captive insurance companies. These self-funded subsidiaries are wholly owned by the institutions and allow them to avoid relying on third-party insurers.', 'While some universities have become well-accustomed to the increasing wave of college sports litigation in recent years, many others—especially those outside the power conferences—have largely been able to watch the developments from the sidelines. Now they face the possibility of being named defendants, an unwelcome prospect.', '', 'Ultimately, the only guaranteed beneficiaries in these legal battles are the lawyers, provided they can keep up with the growing caseload.', '“We feel comfortable we are ready for it,” Shumaker said. “If it turns into a torrent, we will deal with it as it comes.

New NCAA Roster Limits Just Got Approved. Here’s What It Means for Track and Cross-Country,https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a64999097/ncaa-roster-limits-house-settlement/,"['A historic legal settlement could spell problems for collegiate track and field.', 'Massive changes are coming to the NCAA this year.', 'On Friday, June 6, Judge Claudia Wilken approved the House vs. NCAA legal settlement that will fundamentally change Division I college athletics for the imminent future. Some track and field and cross-country rosters could be significantly reduced as a result of the decision, which goes into effect for the 2025-2026 school year.', 'The class-action settlement has three major parts. It will allow universities to share revenue with athletes for the first time—expected to be $20.5 million in the first year—and will provide $2.8 billion in back payments to former NCAA athletes who were not eligible to receive NIL money from 2016-2024.', 'A third part of the settlement has already been affecting many track and field and cross-country athletes. The settlement will set roster limits on each sport. For cross-country, schools will be capped at 17 roster spots, and track and field will be limited to 45. Only schools that opt into revenue sharing will be bound to these numbers.', 'Previously, there was no limit on roster numbers and schools instead had to adhere to scholarship limits: 18 total for women and 12.6 for men. Now, institutions can provide as many scholarships as they have roster spots. But few schools are expected to have the financial resources to use all 45 or 17 potential scholarships.', 'Many schools that opt into the settlement have rosters that are larger than the new limits.', 'Over the past year, some schools that are members of the Power 4 conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC) have begun preparing their rosters for the new numbers. The University of Florida, for example, had 56 men listed on their track team this year and 19 on the cross-country roster, and athletes like Alec Miller were faced with the possibility of not having a spot next year. And some athletes, like Jake Rimmel at Virginia Tech, were already cut in anticipation of the settlement.', 'The SEC, additionally, will limit rosters even further than the settlement’s numbers. Men’s programs will be limited to 35 athletes for track and just 10 for cross-country.', 'Originally, the settlement mandated that teams must adhere to new roster limits for the 2025–2026 school year—and no athletes would be grandfathered in. At that time, Yahoo Sports estimated that over 15,000 athletes across all Division I members could be cut, depending on how many schools opt in to the settlement.', 'But after significant pushback from athletes, the settlement was amended to allow—but not mandate—schools to grandfather in athletes who would have otherwise lost their spot.', 'The schools are instructed to use “good-faith efforts” to identify athletes who “were removed or would have been removed from the roster for 2025-26 due to the implementation of the roster limits.” Those individuals will not count toward roster limits for the rest of their eligibility. This applies to current athletes and those who were recruited to be on a team for the 2025-2026 school year (e.g., incoming freshmen). Schools have until July 6 to identify these athletes.', 'On May 8, Notre Dame became the first school to commit to grandfathering in all athletes.', 'While the settlement was preliminarily approved in October by Judge Wilken, many athletes, parents, and coaches voiced concerns about roster limits—a part of the agreement that was originally not as widely discussed as back payments and revenue sharing. This pushback delayed the approval for nearly two months after the April 7 final hearing.', 'Track and field was one of the sports that was at the center of the debate around roster cuts. At the final approval hearing, Gracelyn Laudermilch, a senior distance runner at Northeast Bradford High School in Pennsylvania, gave a powerful speech about declining opportunities for athletes.', 'Last fall, she was prepared to commit to an unnamed school but was advised by the school’s coach to go elsewhere because the coach had learned they would have to cut at least 15 women from the team to adhere to roster limits. Laudermilch argued to Judge Wilken that roster limits would reduce chances for her and “thousands of athletes” and encouraged her to deny the settlement.', 'Laudermilch also discussed how smaller roster sizes could discourage schools from taking chances on less-developed runners. She cited Olympian Emily Mackay, who was a walk-on in college, as an example of someone who thrived with a long-term approach.', 'NCAA coaches have also expressed concerns with budgets cuts (or complete team eliminations) that could occur due to new expenses from revenue sharing. In March, some of the most prominent coaches in the sport—including Vin Lananna, Ed Eyestone, and Maurica Powell—expressed displeasure with the settlement in a “call-to-action” email, where they mentioned that although scholarship limits will technically increase, “collegiate track and field programs won’t likely see funding across institutions.”', 'Revenue sharing could strain athletic department budgets. Yahoo Sports has reported that most Power-4 schools plan to allocate 90 percent of revenue sharing to football and men’s basketball—the two sports that have the highest chance at generating athletic department revenue. Cross-country and track and field programs generally do not bring in much revenue, if any.', 'On June 7, the U.S. Track & Field and Cross-Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) issued a joint statement, along with coaching associations for wrestling, volleyball, and swimming and diving. The organizations voiced worries that funding for Olympic sports could shrink, and they urged Congress to intervene.', '“We are concerned that the new financial obligations placed on schools will force administrators to divert attention and resources away from non-football and non-basketball sports—the very programs in which the majority of NCAA student-athletes participate,” the statement read. “This is no hypothetical. Budget cuts and program eliminations have already occurred in anticipation of [the settlement’s approval], and more are likely to follow.”', 'Theo Kahler is the news editor at Runner’s World.

NCAA, paving the way for a new era for college sports.', ""Starting this fall, colleges and universities in the NCAA's top division will be allowed to directly pay athletes for the first time. Payments will be limited by a salary cap set initially at $20.5 million per school. And more than $2 billion will be paid out to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while they were in school."", '""Despite some compromises, the settlement agreement nevertheless will result in extraordinary relief for members of the settlement classes,"" U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in Friday\'s order.', 'The approval of the settlement ""marks a huge step forward for college sports,"" said NCAA President Charlie Baker. Direct payments to players, he added, ""is a tremendously positive change and one that was long overdue.""', 'For decades, college athletics were ruled by the tradition of amateurism, and NCAA rules banned schools from compensating players — called ""student-athletes"" by the NCAA — with anything beyond a scholarship that covered the costs of tuition and attending college.', 'But the money in big-time college sports has grown exponentially over the past few decades. Top-level athletic departments rake in hundreds of millions of dollars from broadcast deals, ticket sales, donations and licensing agreements.', '""The money became too big to not allow athletes to get a cut,"" said Noah Henderson, a one-time collegiate golfer who now directs the sports management program at Loyola University Chicago.', 'The House settlement arose out of three different lawsuits over the issue of compensation for collegiate athletes. The plaintiffs were a class of some 390,000 current and former college athletes, and the defendants were the NCAA and five of its athletic conferences. The negotiations took more than a year to complete.', 'There are two major parts of the House settlement: one that looks backward, and one that looks forward.', ""Looking backward, the NCAA and schools have agreed to pay $2.75 billion to former college athletes who played before 2021. That's the year the NCAA changed its rules to allow players to sign licensing agreements to earn money from their name, image and likeness rights, known as NIL. Men's football and basketball players will earn the largest payments, with prominent athletes who played at major schools earning as much as five or six figures."", ""Going forward, the settlement puts in place a new system that will allow schools to pay players directly. Schools will be able to decide which players to pay and how much to pay them. It is expected that most of the compensation will be reserved for players in the sports that generate the most revenue for schools: primarily football, along with men's and women's basketball."", 'The settlement also sets a salary cap. For each school, player compensation across all sports will count against a cap initially set at $20.5 million and that could rise as high as $33 million in 2035. Also new are roster limits, which replace the traditional scholarship limits for each sport. Schools may grant as many scholarships as they like, but team sizes are limited.', ""Around half of the NCAA's 365 Division I schools are expected to adopt the new framework, either because their conferences — the SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and PAC-12 — are named as defendants and they are required to comply with the settlement or because they are expected to opt in to its terms, according to court documents filed by lawyers negotiating the settlement. Some schools, particularly those in the lower football subdivision and those without football teams altogether, will opt out of the settlement and continue to compensate athletes only with scholarships and other costs of attendance."", ""Since 2021, when the NCAA first allowed players to earn compensation from their name, image and likeness rights, NIL payments have become a de facto pay-to-play system. Star players, like Duke's basketball phenom Cooper Flagg, have earned millions of dollars on these deals."", 'Another key part of the settlement takes aim at those supersized NIL deals by establishing a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for ""fair market value.""', 'That concept has been criticized by some in college sports. It is also likely to face legal challenges, said Sam Ehrlich, a professor at Boise State University who tracks college sports litigation.', '""There\'s going to be significant questions moving forward as to what kind of powers that clearinghouse has and whether the clearinghouse is even legal,"" Ehrlich told NPR last month.', 'Sponsor Message', 'Become an NPR sponsor']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

So, no more chaos, right?', 'Right …?', 'RIGHT!?', ""If you believe that I have some oceanfront property in Arizona that you can get for a great deal. College athletics may be entering a new era, but the same issues that have caused anarchy in college football over the last half decade are foundational elements of the sport's governing structure."", 'The NCAA still lacks an anti-trust exemption.', 'The NCAA nor its member schools collectively bargain with their athletes.', 'Lacking one or both of those elements means any changes that come with House are stopgap measures -- flimsy walls constructed to stem a tide of change that continues to erode the old structure of the sport.', '""All these rules are … very arbitrary and are not bargained with the players,"" said Darren Heitner, a sports attorney with a large presence in the NIL space. ""Until the NCAA decides to treat the players as employees or a unit to bargain with, they\'re going to be stuck with challenges on their anti-trust law.""', 'Remember, those lawsuits -- from states and athletes alike -- are the mechanisms that pushed the NCAA further and further away from its amateurism North Star.  ', ""The NCAA didn't allow athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness. So, California passed a law that made it legal for colleges in that state to pay their athletes. That piece of legislation set off dominoes nationally and eventually forced the NCAA to adopt similar rules."", 'When the NCAA attempted to enforce its rules surrounding NIL -- like boosters striking a deal with an athlete or a collective negotiating with an athlete before he enrolled -- a state government once again enacted pressure. ', ""Tennessee's attorney general sued on behalf of the Nico Iamaleava and the Vols, who were under NCAA investigation for rule violations dating back to Iamaleava's recruitment. That suit was successful and essentially broke the NCAA's NIL enforcement mechanism, rendering the association almost powerless to control the obvious rule breaking that continues to occur.  "", 'Athletes pushed the NCAA through the courts, too.', ""Lawsuits shifted the NCAA's transfer rules, creating an environment where players can change schools as often as they'd like in their careers. Challenges to the NCAA's eligibility rules from those like Diego Pavia have shattered the NCAA's long-held stance that players only receive four seasons of eligibility across five total years."", ""Legislation aimed at the NCAA's potential anti-trust violations has been successful again and again this decade. "", ""The House Settlement isn't going to stop athletes from attempting to force change in the courtroom. "", 'The House Settlement puts an annual cap on how much schools can pay their athletes via revenue sharing. The settlement also attempts to dictate who determines fair market value on NIL deals. Athletes will almost assuredly test those restrictions in court. ', '""There will definitely be more lawsuits on that issue,"" said attorney Mit Winter, a lawyer who works heavily in the NIL space. ""The rules that are coming out of the House Settlement don\'t have any anti-trust protections.""', ""It only takes one desperate school to push the boundaries of fair market value. If you don't think a school will get creative -- i.e. break the rules -- to find an extra $500,000 for a five-star recruit, you are probably one of those people who believes wads of cash show up in a McDonald's bag during a recruiting trip by accident."", ""Schools do whatever it takes to get an edge. If their mechanism for landing a high-profile recruit is limited by a pseudo salary cap, you can bet a lawsuit won't be far behind attempting to bust that rule."", ""The NCAA doesn't have an anti-trust exemption that protects it from those challenges. Artificially placing a cap on someone's salary is generally considered anti-competitive in America. That won't change under the rules of the House Settlement even if a governor on compensation makes sense for the overall competitiveness of the sport."", 'In fact, several states, like Tennessee and New Jersey, have enacted state laws that prevent the NCAA from penalizing its schools for paying NIL to its athletes. ', ""Eligibility lawsuits won't stop either. Even if the NCAA at some point allows players five full seasons of eligibility, what prevents a player who just had his eligibility expire under the old rules to sue for the ability to return to the sport for another year?"", ""There will be probable challenges on the grounds of Title IX, especially when you consider the large majority of schools participating in the House Settlement will funnel the majority of their rev share money to men's sports. "", 'That\'s the thing about the House Settlement. Yes, it transforms the way college athletics operates and pushes it toward a near professional model. But the key word there is ""near."" The NCAA is still operating a business based on the principle that its labor force isn\'t technically labor. Athletes are not employees of the school. They lack the ability to collectively bargain.', 'The House Settlement does nothing to change that.

"Historic House v. NCAA settlement gets final approval, allowing schools to pay college athletes",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6367741/2025/06/06/house-ncaa-settlement-approved-revenue-sharing/,"['College Sports', 'NCAA House', 'Settlement', '412', 'By Ralph D. Russo, Stewart Mandel and Justin Williams', 'A federal judge Friday granted final approval of the House v. NCAA settlement, a watershed agreement in college sports that permits schools to directly pay college athletes for the first time.', 'The settlement, which resolves a trio of antitrust cases against the NCAA and its most powerful conferences, establishes a new 10-year revenue sharing model in college sports, with athletic departments able to distribute roughly $20.5 million in name, image and likeness (NIL) revenue to athletes over the 2025-26 season. Previously, athletes could earn NIL compensation only with outside parties, including school-affiliated donor collectives that have become instrumental in teams’ recruiting.', '', 'The NCAA and the power conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12 and SEC), as defendants in the settlement, also agree to pay nearly $2.8 billion in damages to Division I athletes who were not allowed to sign NIL deals, dating back to 2016. The damages will be paid out over 10 years, with most of the money expected to go to former power-conference football and men’s basketball players.', 'Universities can begin directly sharing revenue with college athletes starting July 1.', 'A public letter from NCAA president Charlie Baker described the settlement’s approval as “a new beginning for Division I student-athletes and for the NCAA.”', '“Approving the agreement reached by the NCAA, the defendant conferences and student-athletes in the settlement opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports,” Baker wrote in the letter. “Opportunities to drive transformative change don’t come often to organizations like ours. It’s important we make the most of this one.”', 'Judge Claudia Wilken of the Northern District of California, who previously ruled against the NCAA in the O’Bannon and Alston cases, granted approval roughly a year after parties agreed to settlement terms and nearly two months after a final approval hearing on April 7, when Wilken heard testimony from more than a dozen objectors. Lawyers for both the plaintiffs and defendants noted that the number of objections and opt-outs in the settlement represent a tiny fraction of the nearly 400,000 athletes in the certified class.', 'However, some of those objectors delayed approval, largely citing the settlement’s new roster limits. These limits, which replace sport-by-sport scholarship limits, cap the maximum roster size per team while allowing for every roster spot to receive a scholarship. Schools can offer scholarship funds — partial or full — as they see fit, which creates more potential opportunities. But as schools pre-emptively prepared to comply with those new limits, they removed roster spots for thousands of walk-ons, particularly in football, and partial scholarship athletes in non-revenue sports.', '', 'In late April, Wilken offered an ultimatum, instructing the settlement parties to revise the terms in a way that mitigated any lost roster spots as a result of schools preparing for the new roster limits, or she would deny the whole agreement. Settlement lawyers responded with an amendment that allows for voluntary “grandfathering” of any athletes who lost roster spots as a result of the roster limits, a status that will follow those athletes through the remainder of their eligibility, whether they return to their original school or transfer elsewhere.', 'The initial House v. NCAA case — brought by plaintiffs Grant House, a former Arizona State swimmer, and Sedona Prince, then an Oregon women’s basketball player — was filed in June 2020. It challenged NCAA policy at the time that prohibited athletes from being compensated for the commercial use of their NIL rights or from sharing in the revenue generated from NCAA and conference television contracts. The case was later consolidated with two similar suits, Carter v. NCAA and Hubbard v. NCAA.', 'The cases had not gone to trial. The NCAA and Power 5 conferences, fearful a verdict might result in much higher damages, agreed to a settlement in May 2024. Wilken granted preliminary approval in October 2024.', 'The NCAA’s traditional amateurism model, in which athletes could not receive any compensation beyond a scholarship, began to crumble in 2014 when Wilken ruled against the NCAA in a suit brought by former UCLA star Ed O’Bannon, who objected to his image being used in an EA Sports video game without his permission. Wilken ruled for the plaintiffs, but after an appeals court struck part of her decision, the only tangible effect was that schools began offering cost-of-attendance stipends.', 'The next major case, Alston v. NCAA, made it to the Supreme Court, where the justices ruled 9-0 against the NCAA. Often mischaracterized as a case about NIL, Alston’s main impact was that it allowed schools to provide athletes $5,980 a year in academic expenses. However, the lopsided decision left the NCAA vulnerable to additional legal challenges regarding rules that limited compensation, and it was delivered on June 21, 2021, nine days before numerous state laws allowing NIL payments were set to go into effect. The NCAA quickly scrapped most of its intended restrictions on NIL.', '', 'In the years since, many athletes have entered into deals with local companies and struck lucrative endorsement deals with national brands such as Gatorade and New Balance, as intended. But a far more common practice involves boosters using purported NIL deals to lure recruits or players from the transfer portal to their favorite school. The NCAA’s enforcement division initially sought to punish schools that used NIL as a form of “pay for play” or recruiting inducement, but when the University of Tennessee came under fire in early 2024, the state’s attorney general sued, and a judge issued an injunction prohibiting the NCAA from enforcing those rules.', 'The amount of money being spent in the NIL arena has skyrocketed since 2021. Last year, Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork said the Buckeyes football team — which later won the national championship — was earning $20 million in NIL. CBS Sports recently reported that a number of men’s basketball rosters have already topped $10 million for next season. Earlier Friday, The Athletic reported that Texas Tech softball pitching ace NiJaree Canady signed a second million-dollar deal, roughly a year after signing her first one.', 'To this point, collectives supporting specific schools have ruled the market, but administrators are hoping the House settlement will curtail that influence. In addition to schools being allowed to make NIL deals themselves, the new model also requires all outside NIL deals of more than $600 to go through a clearinghouse that will determine whether the payments are for a valid business purpose and reflect fair market value. Meanwhile, the settlement establishes an enforcement arm that will penalize schools that go over the $20.5 million cap. All of this will be overseen by a newly established regulatory body, called the College Sports Commission, which is in the process of shifting considerable oversight and control of college sports away from the NCAA and to the power conferences.', 'The NCAA’s Division I Board of Directors recently approved a series of proposals, pending settlement approval, that will strike 153 rules from the association’s handbook and clear the way for the settlement terms to be implemented.', '“Today marks a historic milestone for college athletics in the United States,” the newly formed College Sports Commission said in a statement. “Under the new system, student-athletes will have more opportunities to financially benefit during their participation in intercollegiate athletics than ever before.”', 'The settlement represents a significant shift in college sports, but it will not mark the end of the NCAA’s legal challenges. Among numerous ongoing cases, Johnson v. NCAA was filed in 2019 in Pennsylvania and seeks to have athletes classified as employees who are entitled to minimum wage compensation. The NCAA’s efforts to dismiss the case have thus far been denied. Revenue sharing and third-party NIL constraints could also invite additional lawsuits on the basis of Title IX, antitrust violations and conflicts with state laws.', 'NCAA and power conference stakeholders continue to pursue antitrust exemptions in the form of Congressional intervention, in hopes of codifying the settlement and its effectiveness moving forward. President Donald Trump has explored a new commission focused on the issues facing college sports, led by former Alabama head coach Nick Saban and billionaire Texas Tech board chair Cody Campbell, though it is paused as members of Congress pursue legislation.', ' (Photo: Jared C.

"How college athletes will be paid after House v. NCAA settlement: NIL changes, enforcement, contracts and more",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/how-college-athletes-will-be-paid-after-house-v-ncaa-settlement-nil-changes-enforcement-contracts-and-more/,"['', 'The House v. NCAA settlement was officially ratified on Friday, clearing the way for universities to directly pay athletes starting in 2025. The settlement is expected to formally take effect on July 1, 2025, after it was approved by Judge Claudia Wilken of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. ', 'This settlement marks one of the greatest shifts in the history of college athletics by paving the way for formalized pay-for-play for the first time ever. The NCAA cleared several rules banning the practice in the lead-up to the settlement, and the new reality is now here. ', 'So how will players be paid, and what impact will this have on the structure of college football heading forward? ', 'Starting in 2025, colleges will be able to opt into revenue sharing with athletes. Athletic departments will be allowed to use their own funds to pay players, with a cap expected to hover around $20 million annually per school. That figure is intended to cover all athlete compensation across varsity sports -- not just those that generate revenue. ', 'The number represents approximately 22% of average athletic department revenue across power conference athletic departments. The settlement estimates that the total cap will start at around $20.5 million per school in 2025-26 and could rise to nearly $33 million per school in the next decade. Between the revenue sharing, scholarships and other athletic benefits, the NCAA believes that compensation to athletes could push close to 50% of athletic revenue in many athletic departments. ', ""There are few guidelines in place for how the money should be distributed across sports. The expectation is that more than 70% of the funds -- around $15 million -- will go to football at power-conference schools. However, individual schools have the discretion to allocate funds as they choose. For example, Kentucky or UConn could decide to spend 50% of their budget on men's basketball. Non-football schools in conferences, like the Big East, could gain a major advantage when funding other programs."", ""It remains unclear how Title IX will factor into the model, though at least some funds will likely be directed toward women's sports. While players will be compensated directly for participating in college athletics, potentially through contracts worth seven figures or more, they still won't be classified as employees. Instead, their compensation is expected to resemble that of independent contractors."", 'Any NCAA schools that opted into the House settlement will be allowed to participate in revenue sharing, regardless of level or funding. Schools in the Big 12, Big Ten and SEC have all confirmed that they will pay out the full $20+ million rev share each season. The AAC notably is requiring schools to rev-share $10 million with their athletes over the next three years. Sacramento State, an FCS school hoping to transition to FBS, also intends to share revenue. Any school at any level of the NCAA can technically opt into the agreement as long as they in exchange follow the terms of the settlement. Plenty of FBS schools, however, will forego the major new expense. ', 'In the wake of the settlement, the Power Four conferences will take over regulation and enforcement of player compensation issues. They plan to create a new organization called the College Sports Commission, and will hire a CEO soon after the settlement. Power conference schools will be pressured to sign onto the new organization or risk expulsion from their conferences. ', 'The CSC will be in charge of enforcing the upcoming salary cap and working with Deloitte to create the NIL clearinghouse. Additionally, they will police and enforce punishments for circumventing the salary cap or improper athlete compensation. ', 'The decision to move player compensation to the CSC was spurred by the plaintiffs in the House case. The NCAA will continue to focus its enforcement efforts on its traditional issues heading forward, including player eligibility, academics, competition and a variety of other topics. ', 'The new agreement will allow players to sign outside contracts. However, a new wrinkle requires NIL contracts to be sent through a clearinghouse run by Deloitte to ensure ""fair market value"" based on an actual endorsement. For example, a rotation offensive lineman could potentially make six figures in the NIL era. While they will still be allowed to do that with a revenue-sharing contract, future NIL contracts are expected to be far more stringent. Additionally, the NCAA has the right to prohibit NIL compensation from a group it classifies as ""Associated Entities or Individuals,"" which would seem to mean boosters. ', 'Take a player like Cooper Flagg at Duke. His brand value would be considered high for Duke, which could allow the school to pay him for an endorsement without pulling from their revenue sharing money. Notably, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian claimed Quinn Ewers did not take any money from their collective, instead signing endorsement contracts to claim his millions. ', 'Per reports, Deloitte told ACC officials that 90% of existing NIL contracts with public companies would have been approved. More than 70% of deals with booster collectives would have been denied. ', 'The rule is intended to prevent schools from using fake NIL deals to circumvent the salary cap. However, the likelihood of this is highly dependent on whether the Deloitte-run clearinghouse will have any teeth. At least one high-profile sports lawyer has argued for athletes to refuse to disclose NIL deals to the clearinghouse. It remains to be seen how the NCAA will attempt to handle a punitive case of cap circumvention. ', ""There's no one consensus answer on the future of collectives; every school will handle them differently. Some will sunset their collectives and move all operations in-house. Others will use third-party collectives as a support tool for services like connecting athletes with outside endorsements or financial education. Different collectives have different relationships with their respective schools. "", ""The short answer is -- no one knows. Arkansas became the first school to publicly hire an attorney to enforce conditions on an NIL contract when quarterback Madden Iamaleava opted to transfer to UCLA. According to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello, Iamaleava's deal requires a buyout of 50% of the remainder of his contract should he transfer. "", 'Earlier this offseason, Wisconsin lost defensive back Xavier Lucas to Miami and similarly claimed that he was flaunting a two-year binding revenue sharing contract with the school. At this point, no formal legal challenge has been filed. Lucas is now on the roster at Miami. ', 'The binding nature of contracts could be a key complication still remaining for the pay-for-play era. It could soon be addressed by the courts. ', ""Even though the House v. NCAA settlement is coming down, it doesn't solve the biggest remaining questions around contracts, athlete movement, eligibility, NCAA enforcement power or a plethora of other issues. Key athletics leadership has consistently gone to Washington, D.C., to lobby for federal legislation. "", 'Additionally, former Alabama coach Nick Saban and Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville (now a senator) have spoken to president Donald Trump about an executive order to help clarify rules. Trump has proposed a presidential commission to discuss college football issues, though it has not come to fruition. However, the House settlement will at least bring a backdrop for any solutions to be written on. ', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

NCAA settlement and what’s next for the industry.', 'They were joined on the Zoom call by Teresa Gould, commissioner of the Pac-12, which was a named defendant in the lawsuit (along with the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and NCAA) and therefore a participant in constructing the post-settlement world order.', 'Together, the quintet reiterated the need for congressional help to codify rules and provide antitrust protection in order to end the barrage of legal challenges to the NCAA.', 'They explained that the distribution of $20.5 million to athletes starting July 1 won’t be determined at the conference level. How much to allocate to football, men’s basketball and the Olympic sports will be a campus decision.', 'And they acknowledged the post-settlement world is evolving. They don’t have all the systems and personnel in place to immediately clean up what Phillips (ACC) called “an unregulated environment with no rules and no enforcement.” They believe answers, and solutions, will come with time.', 'But is there any reason to believe cheating will disappear? That pay-for-play, which has taken so many forms over the decades, will be expunged from the system? That “bad actors,” as Sankey (SEC) described them, will be banished forever?', 'If effort and determination count, the clean-up effort could succeed.', '“It’s progress over perfection,” Yormark (Big 12) explained. “There will be challenges. But we’re very confident.', '“Our schools want rules. We’re providing rules, and we will be governed by those rules. And if you break those rules, the ramifications will be punitive.”', 'As part of the settlement, the power conferences created the College Sports Commission, with a chief executive, Bryan Seeley, a former lead investigator for Major League Baseball, and a singular mission: Ensure NIL deals are legitimate.', 'For the past four years, they have been anything but.', 'Remember the old-fashioned cheating, when bags o’ cash were given to recruits and their handlers in exchange for signatures on letters of intent? The moment NIL became the law of the land in the summer of 2021, a new, legal form of pay-for-play emerged, courtesy of booster collectives.', 'High school recruits and transfers alike were lured to schools by collectives offering six- and seven-figure deals.

"What I’m hearing about NCAA revenue sharing: $40M football rosters, unintended consequences",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6372328/2025/06/07/college-sports-revenue-sharing-ncaa-house-settlement-changes/,"['NCAAF', 'NCAA House', 'Settlement', '107', 'The House v. NCAA settlement, granted final approval Friday, has been touted as a means of restoring order to this Big Money Era of college sports. Starting this summer, Power 4 and other Division I schools can begin directly paying their athletes via an annual revenue sharing pool capped at roughly $20.5 million per school in year one.', '', 'But because schools have been preparing to navigate this new world order — and how to gain a competitive edge under it — many in the industry expect the budding NIL arms race to continue at the top of the sport, and at a price point much higher than the cap.', '“The top (football) teams are going to cost $40-50 million a year,” said one power conference personnel director. “That’s where this is going. Anyone who thinks different is nuts.”', 'That projected “budget” includes additional NIL (name, image and likeness) payments from collectives and outside organizations to athletes on top of the capped revenue sharing from the school. It would be a steep increase from the market-setting $20 million in NIL money Ohio State funded its roster with last season on the way to a national championship. But most significantly, a number of industry sources believe that $40 million-$50 million rate will continue beyond this upcoming season, where a number of top-end rosters have been uniquely built with front-loaded, pre-settlement NIL deals.', 'This cuts directly against the intent of the settlement, which is designed to stamp out the unspoken pay-for-play deals that have hijacked the NIL marketplace and keep ballooning roster budgets in check.', '“No chance,” the personnel director said.', 'It’s one of the many changes, intended and unintended, coming to college sports under the House settlement.', 'Schools opting in have spent the past year bracing for the financial reckoning this settlement will bring, including where the revenue share money will come from and how it will be distributed. College athletics have been trending in this direction, and to the benefit of most athletes, particularly those in revenue sports who will receive a bigger cut of the billions in television, sponsorship and ticket revenues that pour into power conference athletic departments.', '', 'Many of those same departments, however, are already struggling with the challenges of this transition.', '“We’re all just trying to figure it out as we go through it,” said one power conference head football coach. “The whole deal is to make it a level playing field, but I don’t think that will ever be realistic.”', 'The Athletic spoke with more than a dozen sources across each of the Power 4 conferences about how they plan to approach this new revenue sharing model and all that will come with it — including in-fighting between coaches at the same school, why “tanking” could factor into college sports and how programs will continue to bend rules and find competitive advantages in a post-settlement era.', 'The sources include athletic directors and administrators; coaches, general managers and personnel staffers in football and men’s basketball; and others involved in NIL and collectives. All were granted anonymity in exchange for their candor.', 'The $20.5 million revenue sharing cap goes into effect July 1 and covers every sport under a school’s athletic department. The most prominent football programs expect to have about $15 million of that pool at their disposal, with top programs supplementing that budget with third-party, “over-the-cap” NIL deals.', 'But not so fast, my friends. The settlement includes a new oversight and enforcement arm — named the College Sports Commission — that requires outside deals from collectives and other associated companies and organizations to reflect a valid business purpose and fall within an approved range of compensation. The settlement establishes a clearinghouse, dubbed NIL Go and managed by the accounting firm Deloitte, which instructs athletes to self-report any third-party NIL deals worth $600 or more for review. The idea is that any of those deals that fail to meet a valid business purpose and/or fall within an approved range will be flagged, and must be adjusted or taken to arbitration.', 'From the perspective of the NCAA and power conference leadership, this new enforcement is meant to bring competitive balance and transparency to a lawless, untenable NIL marketplace. But among those who have witnessed the NCAA’s inability to police that marketplace in the past, there’s a lot of skepticism that the settlement will change things.', '', '“It all sounds great in theory, but how will it actually work?” asked one power conference athletic director.', 'Industry sources familiar with the clearinghouse and enforcement plan insist it will have more (and swifter) latitude and punitive power than the NCAA wielded in the NIL era. Until it actually drops that hammer, it’s done little to scare off coaches and recruiting staffs with passionate, deep-pocketed donors.', 'A number of sources questioned whether athletes will even report their third-party deals, or do so accurately. Others suggested that deals getting challenged by the clearinghouse — or the fact that they have to be disclosed at all — could spark more antitrust legal action from collectives. Other sources were outright dismissive.', '“If you tell a booster or business owner they can’t give a star player $2 million, there will be lawsuits,” said the personnel director. “There’s no enforcing this. Fair market value? F— Deloitte. This is going to get even crazier.”', 'A legit enforcement arm with some teeth — perhaps in the form of suspensions or ineligibility — might change that sentiment, and multiple athletic directors suggest that if the clearinghouse merely serves as a minor deterrent to egregious pay-for-play payments, it will be better than pre-settlement circumstances. But others think the undertow of NIL and collectives is too strong to turn back now.', '“There are a lot of rich people that can’t buy a professional sports franchise, but they can give a ton of money to their alma mater,” said a power conference administrator. “And if you’re telling millionaires and billionaires what they can and can’t do with their money, you’re probably going to lose that battle.”', 'The over-the-cap arms race is for high rollers only. It will attract the premier programs that expect to win national championships, but for most schools, even in the power conferences, their focus is on how they will fund a new $20 million budget item.', '', 'Power conference athletic departments operate as self-sustaining organizations with $100 million budgets, where expenses more or less line up with revenues. Operating this way, even as millions upon millions in annual television revenue flowed in, is how the conferences and NCAA became ensnared in so much legal trouble to begin with. Untangling those norms is an admittedly first-class problem, but will require significant budgetary adjustments, including new revenue growth and cost cutting.', 'Most schools are leaning on fundraising and seeking new or increased assistance from campus subsidies or student fees. Virginia Tech, for example, recently announced it will increase student fees and direct a larger portion to athletics to help fund revenue sharing, a path plenty of other schools are considering. Iowa State athletic director Jaime Pollard referenced as much in a recent interview, while noting that Cyclones athletics receive no financial subsidies from the university.', '“Iowa State does not have that (additional) $20 million, but if we don’t pay it for this coming year, we have big problems, right? So we’re going to pay it,” said Pollard. “Would you pay a bigger fee (as a student) … to go to school here so that a member of our men’s basketball team could get paid $1.5 million in addition to their scholarship, their room and board, and all the services they get for being a student on campus? That’s the fundamental question we’re going to have to ask ourselves. Because if we don’t do that, then what we’re saying is that we’re not going to have the athletics program that we’re having.”', 'Even with increased fees and fundraising, there will also be widespread belt-tightening on things like administrative staffing and athlete benefits within athletic departments, such as eliminating Alston payments and reevaluating meal offerings in the facility.', '“If a player is making $500,000 a year, why am I still paying for three meals a day?” said another power conference administrator.', 'There could be new revenue streams from things like on-field logos or naming rights. Long term, departments might get creative, whether that’s an in-stadium restaurant that’s open year-round, purchasing its own housing complexes for athletes or inviting private equity. Last December, Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy and Florida State coach Mike Norvell each restructured lucrative contracts, returning a portion of their salary to the school after disappointing seasons. Kentucky recently announced it is transitioning its athletic department to a nonprofit LLC.', 'Fans will feel it too. Schools such as Tennessee and Arkansas have already increased ticket or concession prices to fund revenue sharing. Some may pass processing fees onto customers, or explore local restaurant and hotel taxes. And the fundraising calls won’t stop.', '', 'Fully eliminating non-revenue varsity sports is another last-resort option for most athletic directors, but it’s already begun, at least outside the power conferences. UTEP discontinued women’s tennis. Cal Poly did the same with men’s and women’s swimming and diving. Saint Francis (Pa.) announced plans to reclassify all athletics from Division I to Division III, just one week after its men’s basketball team played in the NCAA Tournament. Utah shuttered its women’s beach volleyball program, though it did not mention the House settlement and rather cited conference realignment.', '“I know for a fact schools are definitely talking about it,” said an administrator.', 'By any route, the ability for schools to spend the full amount of that annual revenue sharing cap — which will be essential to staying competitive, particularly at the highest levels — is a significant financial undertaking, and one few athletic departments can cobble together without upending their standard operating procedure.', '“Right now it feels like Monopoly. We’re planning to spend to the cap, but we have to figure out how we’re getting there,” said the power conference athletic director. “If you cut a million somewhere, sure that helps, but if you cut $5 (million) or $10 million, you’re really hurting your department.”', 'Generating the money is the first hurdle. Then schools have to decide how to distribute it among their sports. Most FBS athletic departments plan to use the settlement’s backpay formula as a blueprint, with roughly 75 percent earmarked to football ($15 million), 15-20 percent to men’s basketball, 5-10 percent to women’s basketball and whatever is left to the non-revenue sports.', 'Certain universities, like Texas Tech, have been transparent with the percentage of funds going to each sport and how those are calculated. But because there are no stipulations for how the pool must be allocated, it will vary between schools. And could create some dicey internal dynamics.', '“There is absolutely in-fighting (between coaches),” said an administrator.', '', 'Head coaches at the same school are essentially vying with one another for a bigger chunk of revenue share. One power conference administrator said their school plans to direct as much as 25 percent to men’s basketball, which means less for football. There have also been rumblings about how this could benefit the best-resourced basketball programs in the Big East or WCC that don’t have to share with football.', '“There are going to be some challenging and difficult conversations,” said another power conference AD. “Coaches will be paying more attention to the revenue figures of their program than ever before. Everybody wants to make a case why their rev share should increase.”', 'Once a school allocates its revenue share dollars, it’s up to teams to build out the roster accordingly. “Rev cap management,” as one AD phrased it.', 'Many schools have already signed athletes to preliminary revenue share agreements — whether through collectives or the actual university — specifying that payments will transfer to the athletic department on July 1. In addition to the wave of frontloaded NIL deals in recent months, as collectives emptied the coffers ahead of the settlement, schools are inserting notable caveats into these agreements. Some have buyout clauses, where athletes would have to pay money back to a school if they leave before the end of the agreement, similar to coaching contracts. Some suggest that because compensation is based on NIL, it can be adjusted up or down based on performance and/or playing time. Others have strict injury clauses.', '“With some negotiations, we were very direct that if you’re not healthy, you’re not getting the money,” said another power conference personnel director.', 'Whether any of these stipulations hold up in a legal sense remains to be seen, but it’s clear that after years of schools and coaches feeling they were on the short end of the NIL power dynamic, they are attempting to wrest back that control. Still, numerous people consulted for this story said the vast majority of initial revenue share agreements will be for one season until there’s clarity on how legally binding these agreements truly are. Repeats of the Nico Iamaleava holdout saga might be less likely for the time being, but there could be standoffs over payment disputes.', 'Unlike in the NFL, where there is a rookie salary scale and fairly transparent free agency, college football teams are still navigating best roster-building practices. How much money do you set aside for high school recruits? For transfers? Which positions do you value most in your particular system? How should you structure a player’s payments? This could lead to more GM hires in the mold of Andrew Luck or pro-style executives who have administrative power over head coaches and can maintain philosophies across coaching changes.', '', 'Further complicating matters is the fact that the settlement and revenue share calendars operate on the academic fiscal calendar, which runs July to June. This means each football season is split across two separate rev share budgets.', '“If you spend all $15 million on players for the 2025 season, then you aren’t going to be able to pay anyone for the 2026 season until July 1, 2026,” explained the personnel director.', 'This will require thoughtful budgeting, and could spark some innovative approaches — some more palatable than others. “Tanking” has been an issue unique to professional sports, but revenue sharing could usher it into the college ranks. If a team has glaring roster holes at quarterback or other key positions, it could elect to save its revenue share money and go all-in on the transfer portal when the season ends, with a bigger war chest than most of its competitors.', '“I do think you will see teams try to manipulate the cap in different ways,” said another power conference personnel director.', 'From a legal perspective, the lawsuits and court battles won’t stop in the wake of the House settlement. A number of states already have NIL laws that contradict the settlement, and the Johnson v. NCAA case regarding athlete employment is still ongoing.', 'From a competitive perspective, the dollars going up means the competitive imbalance will too. This isn’t a new problem in college sports, but a settlement negotiated with heavy input from the power conferences isn’t going to change that, regardless of how well the clearinghouse works.', '“It’s going to separate, even more, the haves and the have-nots,” said an administrator.', 'Big picture, athletic departments will be forced to adapt, financially and operationally, as college sports lean further away from amateurism and toward a more professional model.', '', '“For the longest time, these athletic departments acted like nonprofits,” said another administrator. “Now they have to act like businesses.”', 'In the meantime, power and non-power programs alike are hoping for some degree of stability in an industry that has had very little in recent years.', '“At some point,” said a personnel director, “maybe we’ll get two years in a row where we know what’s going on.”', ' (Photo of Ohio State football: Carmen Mandato / Getty Images)', 'Justin Williams covers college football and basketball for The Athletic.

The agreement lasts 10 years, and the money is expected to increase annually.', 'While college athletes have been taking in outside payments for their name, image and likeness, the so-called House settlement allows it to come from school coffers (media rights, ticket sales, etc.). What was once mostly unregulated is now mostly regulated.', 'NIL deals will have to go through a clearinghouse to determine whether they are in line with actual endorsement or promotional value -- say Caitlin Clark and State Farm -- and not just a workaround for boosters to pay recruits.', 'Whether all of this can withstand additional legal challenges, practical operational concerns and/or schools actually following the rules remains to be seen. The potential magnitude of the House case is indisputable, though.', '""I tell our coaches and our students, \'The three most significant events in the history of college athletics are, first, the NCAA\'s foundation [1905], second, the adoption of Title IX [1972] and all the opportunities that were created because of it, and, third, the House settlement,\'"" Byrne told ESPN.', 'Byrne welcomes an established system to replace the ""fluidness"" of the past few years and is happy for athletes to be paid. But there on the front lines of implementation, athletic directors have to make this work.', '""It\'s challenging,"" he said.', ""Start with this: Not every student-athlete will now be paid. Indeed, the vast majority won't."", ""Byrne has to weigh how to allocate the $20.5 million in a way that makes the most sense competitively and financially for Alabama. The school has a powerhouse football program, but it also has 20 other teams, including recent national champions in softball, gymnastics, women's golf and men's golf. Men's basketball also reached the 2024 Final Four."", 'Alabama, like many other major universities, tries to win in everything.', '""I tell our coaches, \'We don\'t have a sport here at the University of Alabama just to have a sport,\'"" Byrne said.', ""For generations, though, it has been one sport -- football -- that has made most of the money to fund those other teams. Alabama, like most places, saw only football ($26.4 million) and men's basketball ($5.9 million) deliver a profit in fiscal 2024, according to public records.

It was just four years ago that the NCAA cleared the way for NIL money to start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger.', 'Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte.', 'The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences.

Athletes express concern over impact of $2.8 billion NCAA settlement on non-revenue sports,https://www.10tv.com/article/news/nation-world/ncaa-house-settlement-athletes-react/507-bb4ec5f6-26c1-4afc-bbe7-8304825bbf70,"['WASHINGTON — Sydney Moore and Sabrina Ootsburg were surrounded by hundreds of college athletes at a convention in Charlotte when news broke that the $2.8 billion NCAA settlement had been approved by a federal judge. In a room full of college athletes, they felt like the only two people who understood the gravity of the situation.', '“I’m about to get paid,” Moore said a Division I football player told her.', '“Yes, you are about to get paid, and a lot of your women athlete friends are about to get cut,” she responded.', 'Moore acknowledged that her response might be a stretch, but while the sprawling House settlement clears the way for college athletes to get a share of revenue directly from their schools and provides a lucky few a shot at long-term financial stability, it raises genuine concerns for others.', 'Schools that opt in will be able to share up to $20.5 million with their athletes over the next year starting July 1. The majority is expected to be spent on high-revenue generating sports, with most projections estimating 75% of funds will go toward football.', 'So what happens to the non-revenue-generating sports which, outside of football and basketball, is pretty much all of them?', 'It’s a query that’s top of mind for Ootsburg as she enters her senior year at Belmont, where she competes on the track and field team.', '“My initial thought was, is this good or bad? What does this mean for me? How does this affect me? But more importantly, in the bigger picture, how does it affect athletes as a whole?” Ootsburg said.', '“You look at the numbers where it says most of the revenue, up to 75% to 85%, will go toward football players. You understand it’s coming from the TV deals, but then it’s like, how does that affect you on the back end?” Ootsburg asked. “Let’s say $800K goes toward other athletes. Will they be able to afford other things like care, facilities, resources or even just snacks?”', ""Moore has similar concerns. She just completed her fifth and final year of eligibility at Syracuse University, where she was a key member of the volleyball team. Like Ootsburg, she's become a pioneer in the NIL space and an advocate for college athletes, even though her on-court ventures are behind her."", 'Moore says most female athletes aren’t worried about how much – if any – money they’ll receive. They fear how changes could impact the student-athlete experience.', ""“A lot of us would much rather know that our resources and our experience as a student-athlete is going to stay the same, or possibly get better, rather than be given $3,000, but now I have to cover my meals, I have to pay for my insurance, I have to buy ankle braces because we don’t have any, and the athletic training room isn’t stocked,” Moore said over the weekend as news of Friday night's settlement approval spread."", 'One of the biggest problems, Ootsburg and Moore said, is that athletes aren’t familiar with the changes. At AthleteCon in Charlotte, North Carolina, they said, perhaps the biggest change in college sports history was a push notification generally shrugged off by those directly impacted.', '“Athletes do not know what’s happening,” Ootsburg said. “Talking to my teammates, it’s so new, and they see the headlines and they’re like, ‘OK, cool, but is someone going to explain this?’ because they can read it, but then there’s so many underlying factors that go into this. This is a complex problem that you have to understand the nuances behind, and not every athlete truly does.”', ""Some coaches, too, are still trying to understand what's coming."", 'Mike White, coach of the national champion Texas softball team, called it “the great unknown right now.”', ""“My athletic director, Chris Del Conte, said it’s like sailing out on a flat world and coming off the edge; we just don’t know what’s going to be out there yet, especially the way the landscape is changing,” he said at the Women's College World Series in Oklahoma City. “Who knows what it’s going to be?”"", 'Jake Rimmel got a crash course on the settlement in the fall of 2024, when he said he was cut from the Virginia Tech cross-country team alongside several other walk-ons. The topic held up the House case for weeks as the judge basically forced schools to give athletes cut in anticipation of approval a chance to play — they have to earn the spot, no guarantees — without counting against roster limits.', ""Rimmel packed up and moved back to his parents' house in Purcellville, Virginia. For the past six months, he’s held on to a glimmer of hope that maybe he could return."", '“The past six months have been very tough,"" he said. ""I’ve felt so alone through this, even though I wasn’t. I just felt like the whole world was out there – I would see teammates of mine and other people I knew just doing all of these things and still being part of a team. I felt like I was sidelined and on pause, while they’re continuing to do all these things.”', 'News that the settlement had been approved sent Rimmel looking for details.', '“I didn’t see much about roster limits,"" he said. “Everyone wants to talk about NIL and the revenue-sharing and I mean, that’s definitely a big piece of it, but I just didn’t see anything about the roster limits, and that’s obviously my biggest concern.”', 'The answer only presents more questions for Rimmel.', '“We were hoping for more of a forced decision with the grandfathering, which now it’s only voluntary, so I’m a little skeptical of things because I have zero clue how schools are going to react to that,"" Rimmel told The Associated Press.', ""Rimmel is still deciding what's best for him, but echoed Moore and Ootsburg in saying that answers are not obvious: “I’m just hoping the schools can make the right decisions with things and have the best interest of the people who were cut.”"", 'Copyright 2025 Associated Press.

The changes are set to go into effect July 1.', ""In a 76-page opinion, Wilken ruled that recent changes the principals had made to the settlement's inclusion of roster limits were sufficient. And, following through on what she had said weeks ago, she overruled a wide range of other objections that had been raised to the settlement, including those connected to Title IX and the rights of future athletes over the 10-year run of the settlement agreement."", '""We could not be more excited for the hundreds of thousands of athletes who will now get to enjoy the tens of billions of dollars in new compensation and benefits that the settlement will provide,"" Steve Berman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told USA TODAY Sports. ""It is a historic day for college sports and the rights of athletes.""', ""The total allotment for schools' NIL payments to athletes will be guided by a cap of 22% of the combined total of certain revenues of Power Five conference schools. The dollar amount is set to grow annually, and plaintiffs' economic expert Dan Rascher estimated that these payments will total at least $19.4 billion over the 10-year settlement."", 'The agreement resolves lawsuits involving the NCAA, the Power Five conferences and lawyers for the plaintiffs by providing a deal that also includes the damages pool, most of which is to be paid over 10 years to compensate current and former athletes who were unable to participate in NIL contracts. Athletes whose college careers began between 2016 and Sept. 15, 2024, are eligible for compensation.', 'The damages money will come from the NCAA, which the largest share will come from the association’s central office via new revenue, cost savings and reserve funds. The remainder will come from reductions in NCAA distributions to Division I members, with roughly a quarter coming from members of the Power Five conferences.', '""Approving the agreement reached by the NCAA, the defendant conferences and student-athletes in the settlement opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports,"" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.

""The Commission will investigate any potential violations of these rules, make determinations regarding potential rules violations and penalties, provide notice and opportunity to be heard, participate in the arbitration process and ultimately administer penalties for violations of these rules,"" the announcement said.', 'Bryan Seeley was named the Chief Executive Officer of the commission. He most recently served as an executive vice president of legal & operations with Major League Baseball. Seeley was also an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C.', 'During the process of the settlement approval, there was a wide range of objections to Wilken made in-person and in writing. It is expected there will be some of those objectors appealing her approval. An appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision.', 'In another profound shift for college sports, for schools that choose to pay their athletes for the NIL, the settlement eliminates the current system of team-by-team scholarship limits to implement roster caps on NCAA sports. This will give schools the opportunity to expand the total number of scholarships they can provide but could force some sports to trim their traditional roster sizes.', ""Citing Rascher's estimates, Wilken wrote that the elimination of scholarship limits could result in more than 115,000 additional scholarships being made available to Division I athletes."", 'The inclusion of the roster limits was the target of several objectors to the agreement, who cited the potential for thousands of walk-on athletes and current high school recruits to lose their place on Division I teams. Wilken delayed final approval of the settlement on April 23 due to concerns about how impact on those people.', 'The principals revised the settlement in early May to address the issue. They wrote that they had agreed to a setup under which schools would have the option to exempt from the limits any athlete who was on a roster in 2024-25 and who has been or would have been removed for 2025-26 because of the limits for the remainder of their college careers. It also would let schools similarly accommodate any high school senior who was ""recruited to be, or was assured they would be"" on a Division I school\'s roster for the 2025-26 school year. These athletes are to be identified by the schools as ""Designated Student-Athletes.""', 'However, this did not remove the roster limits from the settlement. And this did not require schools to keep all of their current athletes on their rosters — or to exceed the roster limits at any point. It just gave them the option to do so if they carried a ""Designated Student-Athlete.""', 'The objectors argued that this did not solve the problem Wilken had raised. “A settlement like this one, which vests (the schools) with ‘discretion’ to provide relief – or not – is no settlement at all,” wrote a group represented by Chicago-based attorney Steve Molo.', 'However, Wilken ended up siding with the principals.', 'In her ruling, she wrote the modifications ""negate any harm that the roster limits could have caused to (athletes) who were or will be impacted by the immediate implementation of the roster limits to be eligible for roster spots without the roster limits provisions posing an obstacle.""', 'She added that the ""modifications to exempt Designated Student-Athletes from roster limits will make those athletes more valuable to teams than they otherwise would be, because they will be able to participate on a team without counting against the roster limits.""', 'Molo and Laura Reathaford, another attorney who represented an objection connected to roster limits, were not immediately available for comment.']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df
‘A huge moment’: Martin Jarmond discusses UCLA’s plans after House settlement,https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2025-06-07/how-will-ucla-use-funds-scholarships-under-house-settlement-rules,"['Like a quarterback who completed offseason workouts, spring practices and fall training camp, Martin Jarmond had been preparing for this moment for nearly a year.', 'On Saturday came the big unveiling.', 'The UCLA athletic director discussed with The Times the plans for his department’s operations in the new college sports world created by the House settlement agreement with the NCAA that will allow schools to pay athletes directly for the first time starting July 1.', 'The big takeaways: UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing — the maximum allowed under the settlement — while keeping its Olympic sports programs and athletic department staff intact. The school will also preserve scholarship limits at their current levels for at least one year in order to distribute more revenue sharing money to each player.', '“This is a pivotal moment in collegiate athletics, and we have to continue to invest in our athletics program to compete at the highest level,” Jarmond said. “That’s why student-athletes come to UCLA, to get the best education and compete at the highest level, and we must invest in our student-athletes to provide that championship-level experience.”', 'While Jarmond would not divulge the specifics of his revenue-sharing arrangement, it’s expected that UCLA will follow other Power Four conference schools in using U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken’s back-payment formula as a model for current athletes. Under this formula, which will distribute $2.8 billion to athletes who competed from 2016 to 2024 to compensate them for lost name, image and likeness opportunities, roughly 75% of the money will be shared with football players, 15% with men’s basketball players, 5% with women’s basketball players and 5% with all remaining athletes.', 'SPORTS', '', '“We’ve worked really hard to look at the House settlement, along with other factors,” Jarmond said, “to determine how we were going to split up the revenue share.”', 'Jarmond told The Times last year that he anticipated a bigger share of revenue going to football and men’s basketball players because they were “responsible for more of the revenue based on the House settlement and the back pay for NIL and all those things.” Payments will rise each year as part of the 10-year settlement agreement.', 'Even though roster limits could eventually rise to 105 for football and 15 for men’s basketball as part of the settlement, keeping scholarship limits at their current levels — 85 for football, 13 for men’s basketball — will allow UCLA to provide each player on scholarship a bigger share of revenue. As part of the settlement agreement, any money used for scholarships (which have an estimated value of $65,000 per athlete at UCLA) comes out of the revenue sharing pot. Jarmond said his department would reevaluate this arrangement in a year to ensure it was best serving the school’s athletes.', 'UCLA is also committed to preserving its Olympic sports that have provided the lion’s share of NCAA championships in an athletic department widely regarded as one of the best in the nation. Jarmond said there would be no staffing cuts, but some personnel might be reassigned to better serve the athletic department.', '“We are looking at reallocating staff,” Jarmond said, “to positions that better meet our needs in a changing landscape.”', 'The ability to pay players directly could help UCLA in ways that go beyond compensating its athletes. Revenue sharing arrangements could help narrow the resource gap between the Bruins and other Big Ten Conference schools that had more deep-pocketed NIL collectives engaging in pay-for-play practices.', 'Now, all new NIL deals exceeding $600 must be approved by NIL Go, a clearinghouse created by the College Sports Commission to analyze deals to ensure they serve a valid business purpose and provide fair market value.', 'It’s expected that all existing college NIL collectives — including UCLA’s Men of Westwood (which serves men’s basketball), Bruins for Life (football) and Champion of Westwood (women’s basketball, Olympic sports) — will essentially become marketing agencies that try to find endorsement deals for athletes.', 'UCLA SPORTS', '', 'Jarmond said UCLA was seeking a third-party partner to help secure so-called true NIL opportunities. Being based in Los Angeles should provide Bruins athletes with a clear advantage in securing marketing deals, Jarmond said.', 'Other challenges remain. Having traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby for federal NIL legislation, Jarmond said he believed it was necessary to eliminate the imbalance that exists with more than 30 states having their own NIL laws.', 'While distributing $20.5 million in revenue will be another financial blow to an athletic department that has run $219.5 million in the red over the last six fiscal years — though the entire debt has been covered by the university, bringing the balance to zero — Jarmond said he has long championed athletes being paid and believes the move is long overdue. As part of the settlement involving back pay to athletes, UCLA’s share of NCAA revenue will be reduced by more than $1 million annually for the next 10 years.', 'UCLA’s finances could soon improve under a College Football Playoff revenue sharing agreement that is expected to provide Big Ten schools an additional $8 million to $12 million annually beginning in 2026. That’s on top of media rights deals tilted heavily in favor of Big Ten and Southeastern Conference schools, giving the Bruins another infusion of much-needed cash.', 'The athletic department has a new ally in Chancellor Julio Frenk, who signaled his intention to be closely involved with the school’s sports programs during a recent interview with The Times.', '“Chancellor Frenk has been extremely supportive of athletics and the impact that it has on our community,” Jarmond said. “He has been supportive of our efforts every step of the way. He hit the ground running during a pivotal time not just for athletics but the university, and he has demonstrated support at a high level and I’m grateful for his leadership at such a pivotal time for athletics.”', 'While acknowledging that UCLA athletics needed to be more creative with revenue generation as part of what he called “a huge moment” that would forever change the trajectory of college sports, Jarmond said the school’s commitment to sports was unwavering.', '“We have to be bold and innovative in this new world,” Jarmond said. “UCLA has always been on the forefront and been a leader and that’s not going to change.

I think it\'s worth pursuing and I think some of these things can be fixed if people tried to fix them."" ', 'Two months later, college athletics still waits.

A few lawyers involved in the case have a betting pool guessing when it will finally drop. All are losers so far.

""It\'s at the commissioner level, the president\'s level, the coaches\' level.""', ""Another source joked that if Wilken really wanted to mess with athletic administrators, she would render her final decision during next week's National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics conference, while many athletic department heads are in attendance in Orlando rather than working on their respective campuses. During a time that should be a relative respite for athletic administrators, the impending settlement has them stuck in purgatory. "", ""In the lawsuit's original language, the two sides had only until June 6 to finalize the settlement, or the case would go to trial. On Monday, Wilken granted a motion to extend that deadline to June 27. That comes just four days before administrators expect to start revenue sharing with athletes on July 1. "", '""I learned a long time ago, we don\'t control the court system,"" SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said. ""So, is there a hope? Is there a thought? Do people say it would be decided at this point? Yes. We have a responsibility for implementation. So does it pivot what we say this week? Yep. Does it mean we\'re going to keep preparing? We\'re going to keep preparing and we\'re going to wait to see the judge\'s final decision on the proposed settlement."" ', ""Wilken, 75, is now one of the most important people in the history of college athletics. The senior district judge of California's Northern District was named to the federal bench in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She works out of Oakland, California. Because of her location, she has overseen cases involving some of the world's largest retail and tech companies. "", ""Her first foray into major college athletics came in 2014, when she presided over the landmark O'Bannon v. NCAA lawsuit, which most consider the beginning of the end for the NCAA's amateurism model. In the O'Bannon case, Wilken ruled that withholding payments to athletes was against antitrust law and expanded scholarships to cost-of-attendance. "", ""Years later, she also presided over the the NCAA v. Alston case, which expanded permissible educational benefits to include cost-of-living stipends. Both of Wilken's decisions were later upheld by the Supreme Court, setting off another flurry of lawsuits that helped shape the unregulated morass that college athletics faces today.

She wants to hear both sides, and she really thinks deeply about both sides. The attorneys on both sides will cite case law to support their arguments, and she gets her clerks hopping, researching all the case law being cited.""', 'However, the federal judiciary is built to focus on precision, not speed.

She did not issue her 100-page opinion until almost six months later in March 2019. "", ""Lawyers speculate that the extension is a positive sign. If she approves the settlement, it won't be long until there are appeals. Writing airtight legal language is critical. If she were to deny the settlement, it's not appealable.

A denial or no action on it, however, would be a clear sign she will be denying the settlement.', '""We need to have certainty because we went from a land of certainty to no certainty, and we\'re desperate for that and I am very thoughtful,"" Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte said. ""I\'m hopeful in her deliberate response that she\'s taking this time, because the ramifications of this case are just completely changing our environment. I\'m not as worried about that, but I\'m just hoping that\'s with her delay."" ', ""While Wilken is not beholden to the July 1 deadline, it remains a critical date for college athletics. It's the beginning of the new academic year, making it a logical transition point logistically for college athletics to implement the new system. It's the official date when many teams moving conferences join their new leagues and the month when football programs begin training camps. "", ""All of the uncertainty has hit at a time when athletic departments are typically in the midst of turning the page to next year, instead they're still scrambling.

We\'re preparing a budget for the beginning of the school year in July, so you\'re trying to figure out what that means and where it\'s going to land.', '""You\'ve run all these scenarios, and then you\'re looking at rosters with your coaching staffs, and you\'re trying to prepare for that -- running different scenarios on \'grandfathered in\' clause (and) what the roster limit means. So right now, you\'re just doing triple, quadruple the work going into the school year, because you don\'t know the final answer. You can predict and get decision trees made, but you have a lot of decision trees as you go through this process.""', ""But perhaps most pertinent, numerous programs have signed revenue-sharing deals with college athletes that are contingent on the House settlement's approval. The NCAA announced it will eliminate 150 rules to allow schools to pay athletes directly, contingent on approval. Rosters have been purged and employees have been laid off to prepare for the new financial realities. The past 12 months have all been spent preparing for this moment. "", 'Regardless of whether the House case is settled, the belief remains that schools will voluntarily begin sharing revenue on July 1 -- everyone is too far in. However, if that happens without a settlement, it will mean almost every guardrail to standardize the system will not apply. ', ""The settlement plans to set a salary cap of approximately $20.5 million. It forces all NIL contracts to go through a Deloitte clearinghouse called NIL Go to ensure fair market value. The upcoming College Sports Commission, which plans to hire a CEO, will not be created. Without those measures, there's no legally enforceable way to regulate player compensation."", '""If they don\'t pass it, I\'ll be hitting every college up on Aug. 1 demanding new contracts,"" one NIL agent told CBS Sports. ', 'Meanwhile, schools have developed contingencies should the settlement be denied, but some have not shared those plans with their conferences or fellow schools, sources told CBS Sports. The clandestine operation promises more competitive imbalance as some schools opt to pay athletes and others pull back on their efforts to save costs.', 'Should the settlement be approved, unlimited scholarships will be allowed under new roster limits. Not all schools will fully fund those scholarships, however. The SEC has required its members to set aside $2.5 million of its $20.5 million cap for new scholarships. ', 'Revenue sharing will also not benefit every sport. For example, Texas A&M and Oklahoma plan to share revenue with six sports at their schools. Both schools declined to disclose which six programs would benefit from an influx of cash to players in a perceived effort to gain an advantage over rivals who may choose to direct their cash flow elsewhere in programs that are less competitive.', 'Even in a new world of regulation and guardrails designed to benefit players and level the playing field, every school is still looking for a competitive advantage.', ""As the clock ticks toward July 1, one administrator summed it up best in a college sports landscape that is continually building the plane as it's in midair.

$2.8 billion House v. NCAA settlement hangs in balance as federal judge extends response deadline,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2-8-billion-house-v-ncaa-settlement-hangs-in-balance-as-federal-judge-extends-response-deadline/,"['', 'The marathon legal battle regarding player compensation and the makeup of college athletics in a landmark, multibillion-dollar antitrust case took another turn Monday night.', 'A federal judge granted attorneys involved in the $2.8 billion settlement an extension to to file ""summary judgement and Daubert briefing."" With both sides still waiting for a final judgement and the original deadline coming on June 6, the new June 27 date provides proper time for a potential appeal. It also pushes the timeline for a potential resolution even closer to the expected start of revenue sharing payments to athletes on July 1. ', 'Both sides came to a compromise on tweaking the aspect of roster limits in the settlement on May 7, which they hope will convince a federal judge to grant final approval. The judge twice voiced concerns over proposed roster limits, a small but significant aspect of the deal that will enable schools to pay athletes a portion of their media revenues, capped at $20.5 million.', 'Under the compromise, schools would be allowed — but not required — to reinstate players who were cut from rosters during the 2024-25 academic year without those players counting against new roster limits set to be implemented July 1. Purged players exempt from roster limits can also transfer to new schools.', 'The key language in the brief, however, is that roster-limit exceptions are to be made at a school\'s discretion. It remains to be seen if the brief will satisfy Judge Claudia Wilken of the Northern District of California, who specifically asked attorneys to ""grandfather"" all players into the deal, after twice delaying a decision on whether to approve the settlement in April.', '""In other words, there are no guarantees that designated student-athletes will get or maintain roster spots,"" the NCAA and power conference\'s counsel wrote in a supplemental brief Wednesday. ""But that does not adversely affect any injunctive relief class member.""', 'High school seniors who were promised scholarships that were later rescinded because of the proposed roster limits will also be exempt.', 'Now, college athletics waits – again – for a decision from federal court. Wilken gave preliminary approval in October, speaking in favor of most aspects of the deal. However, she has twice delayed final approval because of language tied to roster limits, which could lead to an estimated 5,000 players being cut from sports across the NCAA. ', 'Several objectors testified April 7 against replacing scholarship limits with roster limits at a settlement hearing in the District Court of Northern California. In a brief filed April 23, Wilken ordered attorneys to develop a plan to ""grandfather"" current players into the agreement, allowing schools to temporarily exceed new limits as part of a phase-in solution for rosters. A two-week negotiation ensued.', ""If Wilken is not satisfied with the parties' resolution and declines final approval, the case may advance to trial, a daunting prospect for the NCAA, which has been bludgeoned legally over student-athlete compensation and lambasted by the Supreme Court over the last five years. If the NCAA and power conferences lose in trial, the parties could be liable for $20 billion in damages."", 'If the settlement is not approved, schools may soon turn to their state governments to help legalize direct pay to players, who have planned to be paid a share of the $20.5 million pool next fall.', ""Wilken's request on April 23 to renegotiate aspects of roster limits sent shockwaves across the country, complicating matters for many schools that had already begun cutting players from rosters. Under the preliminary settlement released in October, football rosters were set to shrink to 105 players, meaning as many as 30-plus players would be cut at each school. Even before the judge's final approval, schools began to cut players in the spring in preparation for the settlement's implementation on July 1."", 'Putting the toothpaste back in the tube could prove difficult for athletic departments. Some purged players landed at new schools, but many remain without a home, hoping to land again at their former schools. Most schools might be unwilling to re-sign players and spend extra scholarship money – as well as room and board, meals and health care – that balloon already-tight budgets.', 'In a brief filed April 23, Wilken was unmoved by the schools\' plight, writing that ""any disruption that may occur is a problem of Defendants\' and NCAA members schools\' own making.""', ""The settlement's touchstones remain uncchanged. Starting July 1, NCAA schools can share as much as $20.5 million in revenue with their athletes, and former athletes who played between 2016 and 2024 will be paid $2.8 billion in back payments if the settlement is approved."", ""Each school's revenue-sharing cap will increase 4% each year during the 10-year agreement. "", ""The class-action antitrust lawsuit was filed in 2020 by Arizona State swimmer Grant House and women's college basketball player Sedona Prince seeking an injunction against the NCAA and the Power Five conferences. It sought to lift restrictions on revenue sharing of media rights revenues. "", 'Powerful antitrust attorneys Steve Berman and Jeffrey Kessler represented the plaintiffs.', 'If approved by the judge, the settlement would resolve three antitrust lawsuits: Carter v. NCAA, House v. NCAA and Hubbard v. NCAA.', 'A decision: Judge Claudia WIlken will study the brief and decide whether to grant final approval to the House v. NCAA settlement, which was first introduced in October and has included months of negotiations.', ""Revenue-sharing formula: Many schools are preparing to mirror the back-payment formula in their revenue-sharing model for the future. That means roughly 75% of future revenue will be shared with football players, 15% to men's basketball, 5% to women's basketball and 5% to all remaining sports. Those numbers will differ from school to school, but most power programs have shared similar models with administrators."", 'CBS Sports has learned one school is preparing to share more than 85% of the $20.5 million pool with football players – a reflection of the percentage of annual revenue the sport generates for its athletics department. ', ""More lawsuits: Concerns over Title IX and antitrust issues will continue after the settlement is approved. However, instead of the NCAA being the target, individual schools may soon become the focus of litigation. Each school will split the revenue pie based on its own formulas, meaning a women's basketball player may sue a school if they believe they are not receiving their fair share of cash. The same can be said for a football player if their revenue share is lower than that of a rival player at another school. "", 'The White House is set to weigh in: The NCAA has long lobbied Congress to pass legislation protecting the organization and its members from antitrust litigation. Now the White House has zeroed in on college athletics.', 'President Donald Trump is creating a presidential commission on college athletics to find solutions for ""issues ailing the ecosystem,"" according to Yahoo! Sports. Trump was considering an executive order to regulate NIL after meeting with former Alabama coach Nick Saban, according to the Wall Street Journal. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn coach, also met with Trump last week to discuss college athletics. Steve Berman, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the House case, criticized the president\'s potential actions, saying that an executive order would lead to more lawsuits.', ""Sen. Ted Cruz is reportedly drafting a bill that could offer the NCAA limited antitrust protection. It's not clear how Trump's plans may affect Cruz's draft."", 'New enforcement model: The power conferences are expected to launch soon the College Sports Commission, an enforcement arm to police the settlement among its schools. The new organization effectively replaces the NCAA regarding NIL enforcement, and will monitor NIL deals between players and third parties, and oversee revenue-sharing practices at schools. This new organization will also penalize schools and individuals who break rules. ', 'Who is footing the bill? The NCAA is responsible for 40% of the $2.8 billion settlement, and the remaining 60% will come from reducing its revenue distributions to the 32 Division I conferences over the next 10 years ($1.6 billion). The NCAA is utilizing a formula based on revenue distribution presented to each league over a nine-year period starting in 2016, which leans heavily on basketball units tied to NCAA Tournament participation, according to Yahoo Sports. The Power Five conferences – ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC – will pay 24% of the overall damages, followed by the Group of Five at 10%.The FCS is on the hook for 14% and non-football conferences in Division I will pay 12% of the overall agreement, according to documents reviewed by CBS Sports.', '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The professionalization of college athletics will be seen in the high-stakes and expensive recruitment of stars on their way to the NFL and NBA, and they will be felt by athletes whose schools have decided to pare their programs. The agreement will resonate in nearly every one of the NCAA’s 1,100 member schools boasting nearly 500,000 athletes.', '“Approving the agreement reached by the NCAA, the defendant conferences and student-athletes in the settlement opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports,” NCAA President Charlie Baker said.', 'Wilken’s ruling comes 11 years after she dealt the first significant blow to the NCAA ideal of amateurism when she ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon and others who were seeking a way to earn money from the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) — a term that is now as common in college sports as “March Madness” or “Roll Tide.” It was just four years ago that the NCAA cleared the way for NIL money to start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger.', 'Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte.', 'The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC hold most of the power and decision-making heft, especially when it comes to the College Football Playoff, which is the most significant financial driver in the industry and is not under the NCAA umbrella like the March Madness tournaments are.', 'The deal looked ready to go since last fall, but Wilken put a halt to it after listening to a number of players who had lost their spots because of newly imposed roster limits being placed on teams.', 'The limits were part of a trade-off that allowed the schools to offer scholarships to everyone on the roster, instead of only a fraction, as has been the case for decades. Schools started cutting walk-ons in anticipation of the deal being approved.', 'Wilken asked for a solution and, after weeks, the parties decided to let anyone cut from a roster — now termed a “Designated Student-Athlete” — return to their old school or play for a new one without counting against the new limit.', 'Wilken ultimately agreed, going point-by-point through the objectors’ arguments to explain why they didn’t hold up.', '“The modifications provide Designated Student-Athletes with what they had prior to the roster limits provisions being implemented, which was the opportunity to be on a roster at the discretion of a Division I school,” Wilken wrote.', 'Her decision, however, took nearly a month to write, leaving the schools and conferences in limbo — unsure if the plans they’d been making for months, really years, would go into play.', '“It remains to be seen how this will impact the future of inter-collegiate athletics — but as we continue to evolve, Carolina remains committed to providing outstanding experiences and broad-based programming to student-athletes,” North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham said.', 'The list of winners and losers is long and, in some cases, hard to tease out.', 'A rough guide of winners would include football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, which will devote much of their bankroll to signing and retaining them. For instance, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood’s NIL deal is reportedly worth between $10.5 million and $12 million.', 'Losers will be the walk-ons and partial scholarship athletes whose spots are gone. One of the adjustments made at Wilken’s behest was to give those athletes a chance to return to the schools that cut them in anticipation of the deal going through.', 'Also in limbo are Olympic sports many of those athletes play and that serve as the main pipeline for a U.S. team that has won the most medals at every Olympics since the downfall of the Soviet Union.', 'All this is a price worth paying, according to the attorneys who crafted the settlement and argue they delivered exactly what they were asked for: an attempt to put more money in the pockets of the players whose sweat and toil keep people watching from the start of football season through March Madness and the College World Series in June.', 'What the settlement does not solve is the threat of further litigation.', 'Though this deal brings some uniformity to the rules, states still have separate laws regarding how NIL can be doled out, which could lead to legal challenges. NCAA President Charlie Baker has been consistent in pushing for federal legislation that would put college sports under one rulebook and, if he has his way, provide some form of antitrust protection to prevent the new model from being disrupted again.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

"College sports enters new era after NCAA settlement, but it won't work if schools cheat",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/columnist/dan-wolken/2025/06/07/ncaa-settlement-sports-revenue-sharing-schools/83235725007/,"['Don’t think about the House vs. NCAA settlement as an instant cure for all of the issues disrupting, and in some cases swallowing, schools at the top level of college sports. ', ""Instead, it’s more like the timeout a basketball coach is forced to take after watching his team give up six consecutive layups so he can draw up a zone defense and try to stop the bleeding. A change of strategy might work, but without a full commitment from the players in the game to execute the plan, it's over before it begins. "", 'In theory, the settlement is a big step in the right direction to solving issues.', ""It forces the wealthy, power-conference programs to directly share revenue with the athletes who help create the popularity of college football and basketball primarily, but other sports too, if the school so chooses. It sets a de facto salary cap that forces schools to prioritize not just which sports to invest in, but which athletes. It allows schools to sign enforceable, multi-year contracts that should ease at least some of the transfer madness. And it has an enforcement component that should — if it works the way it's intended — bring name, image and likeness deals back into the realm of Caitlin Clark appearing in State Farm commercials rather than school-affiliated booster groups paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a couple of meet-and-greets and calling it NIL. "", 'But there’s no guarantee any of this is going to work. And the main reason is because success will require schools to do something that they’ve never done in the history of college sports: Acknowledge that the rules are in place for the common good and must be applied to everyone, including themselves.', ""It sounds simple. But the decades-long track record of screaming and threatening whenever the NCAA attempted to enforce penalties on rule-breakers suggests it’s going to be one of the biggest challenges in the history of the association. As one prominent athletics director said recently, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the settlement was still pending, all of the stakeholders in this — including state legislatures and booster groups constantly looking for loopholes and gray areas — must agree to be governed, or they simply won't be. "", 'In fact, the need for complete buy-in on policing of NIL deals and the revenue-sharing cap is so profound that the new enforcement entity being established by the Power Four conferences spent months drafting a document schools will be required to sign that prevents them from suing if they don’t like the result of their internal arbitration process. Having that final authority vested in a third party is considered crucial by the Power Four to any semblance of self-governance, a person with direct knowledge of the process told USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the group.', 'But will it work? I’m skeptical, as everyone should be.', 'The reason is because pulling this off will require a complete mindset change from the way college sports have always operated, and I’m not sure the necessary foundational work has been done to make that transition. ', 'In the NFL or NBA, for instance, team owners are highly competitive but fundamentally understand that they are business partners more than competitors, driving long-term decision-making that works to everyone’s benefit. ', ""College sports has never had that mentality. Schools and conferences attempt to work together when necessary, but they ultimately see each other as adversaries to take advantage of and exert leverage on when it suits their immediate interests. It's a theme we've seen over and over again in everything from conference realignment to how they reacted to COVID in 2020 to the future structure of the College Football Playoff. They are forever probing for the smallest competitive advantage, pushing the limits of the rules and crying foul when the NCAA comes in to investigate."", 'That’s how athletics administrators and college presidents are conditioned to operate, especially in the social media era where their feedback loop is imbued with tribalism: When your rival gets caught, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent. When you get caught? Lawyer up, plant stories in the media and do everything possible to discredit the group holding you accountable.', ""Look, we can debate the history and effectiveness of NCAA enforcement – investigative tactics used, places where they've overreached, rulings that seemed inconsistent – but the process was set up and endorsed by the schools themselves because they did not trust each other to color within the lines. And its fundamental underpinning was the willingness of schools to submit to that system and even punish themselves when it was clear they broke rules. "", ""What happened over time, though, was an erosion and ultimately outright rejection of that body’s authority to enforce its rulebook. Yes, some of that was the NCAA's fault, but let’s get real."", ""It happened mostly because coaches and administrators facing penalties too often got better outcomes when they fought, refused to cooperate or found someone to throw under the bus because they knew the weakness of the system: It wasn’t a court of law, and its processes wouldn't necessarily stand up to that level of scrutiny."", 'Fair enough. ', 'But every time a major school with resources skates on a massive scandal (cough, North Carolina, cough), or when a state-level attorney general does a school’s dirty work to make sure NIL rules can’t be enforced (cough, Tennessee, cough), or when an unfavorable transfer eligibility ruling ends up in court (cough, West Virginia, cough) because schools believe they’re getting a raw deal from the bureaucracy they vested power in, it chips away at the very idea that schools are willing to be governed, until we arrive at a place where there’s not much governance remaining.', 'Do school presidents and athletic administrators have the collective will and discipline to suddenly do a 180-degree turn and submit to this new set of rules rather than look for creative ways to avoid them? Will they suddenly put faith into a different kind of bureaucracy that will undoubtedly, at some point, shoot down a key NIL deal or penalize a school for trying to get around the cap? ', 'That might be possible if, just as an example, Florida trusted Georgia or Ohio State trusted Michigan to play by the same set of rules, or vice versa. But what almost always happens instead in those kinds of rivalries is that one side believes the other will do something on the edge of the rules to get a player, thus giving themselves permission to go into the gray area as well. ', ""And when that happens under this new settlement, every administrator will tell you they want the enforcement arm to strictly apply the rules so that college sports doesn't slide back into the kind of chaos they have experienced the last four years. "", ""But will they still feel that way when it's applied to their own program? When it costs them a player? When it costs them wins? When it potentially costs them a job? "", 'If not, the House settlement will fall apart quickly – and take the entire structure of college sports down with it.

For many fans, it was so complicated that they didn’t pay attention.', 'But there is one burning question that has yet to be answered and may not be known for another week: What does it mean for North Dakota State fans? Maybe not much, maybe a lot.', 'Schools have until Sunday to decide whether to opt in to the settlement, meaning they have to operate under new guidelines, or opt out. If they opt out, not much changes. NDSU athletic director Matt Larsen said the athletic department is undecided, but the deadline is looming.', 'If the Bison opt out, that would mean the football team would still field a roster of around 110 to 120 players, would still have to adhere to the FCS scholarship maximum of 63 full rides, Alston and Cost of Attendance payments would stay the same and The Green and The Gold Collective would still act as a third party providing payments and NIL opportunities.', 'Opting in to the settlement would result in major changes. Schools would have the ability to revenue share with athletes up to $20.5 million in the first year, with that amount increasing in future years.', '“Outside of the Power Four, there are not a whole lot of schools that are worried about that cap,” Larsen said, “because they’re not going to get there.”', 'Power Four schools like Big Ten Conference programs are required to opt in. What does that mean? Schools can directly compensate athletes for NIL, they can go above the current cost of attendance standard (at NDSU it’s $3,400 for a full scholarship athlete) and Alston payments ($5,980 at NDSU).', 'Schools that opt in can still be aligned with a collective, but those benefits in excess of $600 will have to go through a clearinghouse managed by Deloitte, a large auditing company.', '“There’s going to be a lot greater scrutiny on those third party payments now to make sure there is a valid business purpose to those things,” Larsen said. “It’s not just pay for play. If you’re a school that is opting in and let’s say you’re a large FBS school, and between all of your revenue share you need to exceed the $20.5 million cap, you can do that through your collective or third parties. Those also are going to be under heavy scrutiny to make sure there’s a legitimate business purpose.”', '', 'In January, Larsen said he was around 99% percent sure NDSU was not going to opt in for the first year, with that decision being made on a yearly basis. That was also with a March 15 deadline in mind, but that changed. Judge Claudia Wilken’s long-awaited decision grandfathered the roster cap numbers, meaning if NDSU opted in, it wouldn’t immediately have to get down to 105 players for football but do it gradually over a few years.', 'A few like-minded FCS schools to NDSU like Montana State and Montana have already declared their intent to opt in.', 'But by also opting in, the Bobcats and Grizzlies are now free to offer 105 full scholarships for football if they so choose.', '“The biggest change is instead of having scholarship maximums, they now have roster caps,” Larsen said. “They’ve removed the scholarship minimums.”', 'Time is of the essence for NDSU to make a decision.', '“We have six days,” Larsen said.', '', '', 'ADVERTISEMENT']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

NCAA antitrust settlement received final approval, opening the door for millions of dollars to be shared between schools and players for the first time."", 'U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken gave final approval of the landmark settlement after five years of litigation, ending with nearly one year of discussions and tweaks after the NCAA and power conferences initially voted to settle the suit in 2024. The $2.8 billion, 10-year settlement will pay past players for missed name, image and likeness opportunities and allow colleges to pay current players directly starting July 1.', 'NCAA president Charlie Baker penned a letter in response to the landmark settlement. ', '""Approving the agreement reached by the NCAA, the defendant conferences and student-athletes in the settlement opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports,"" Baker wrote. ""This new framework that enables schools to provide direct financial benefits to student-athletes and establishes clear and specific rules to regulate third-party NIL agreements marks a huge step forward for college sports."" ', 'Schools can share as much as $20.5 million of their revenues with players during the upcoming academic year. The settlement also includes $2.8 billion in back payments for athletes who competed between 2016 and 2024. The new revenue-sharing cap will increase by at least 4% each year during the 10-year agreement. ', 'The House settlement\'s final approval was twice delayed in April after the judge echoed objectors\' concerns over imposing roster limits on current players, one of the pillars of the settlement. Schools were cutting players from rosters in the spring, even though the settlement had yet to be approved, complicating discussions during settlement hearings. The judge asked attorneys to craft a plan to allow current players to be ""grandfathered in"" with the new roster limits. The NCAA, power conferences and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit instead offered a compromise: schools have the option to keep current players on their rosters and temporarily exceed new limits until their eligibility expires.', ""The new roster limits were expected to lead to the cutting of nearly 5,000 athletes from teams across the NCAA's 43 sponsored sports. Some sports will increase roster limits compared to previous years, but many will be trimmed despite offering unlimited scholarships within those new thresholds. Football rosters will shrink to 105 players, resulting in schools cutting more than 20 players, though most schools are expected to exceed those limits by grandfathering in current athletes."", ""The House v. NCAA class-action antitrust lawsuit was filed in 2020 by Arizona State swimmer Grant House and women's college basketball player Sedona Prince seeking an injunction against the NCAA and Power Five conferences. It sought to lift restrictions on revenue sharing of media rights revenues. Powerful antitrust attorneys Steve Berman and Jeffrey Kessler represented the plaintiffs."", 'The settlement resolved three antitrust suits: Carter v. NCAA, House v. NCAA and Hubbard v. NCAA.', 'NCAA rules have long prohibited players from cashing in on their NIL, but that changed July 1, 2021 when the organization began allowing players to earn money from third parties and collectives. The House settlement will enable schools, for the first time, to pay players directly.', ""How schools plan to divvy up to $20.5 million among their sports has been a point of contention, with no legal framework to follow. Most schools are expected to mirror the back-payment formula outlined in the $2.8 billion settlement. That means roughly 75% of future revenue will be shared with football players, 15% to men's basketball, 5% to women's basketball and 5% to all remaining sports. Some schools have opted to mirror the gross revenue each sport averages, which could lead to more than 85% of the salary pool being set aside for football players."", 'How revenue-sharing will affect skyrocketing NIL deals among third parties is unknown. Still, those deals with third parties and collectives outside the revenue-sharing plan will soon face intense scrutiny from a new enforcement entity starting July 1. Experts believe it will help curb ""pay-for-play"" schemes between boosters and players far beyond perceived market values. Many multi-million dollar deals with high-profile players were struck in the months before the House settlement\'s approval so that those deals would not be scrutinized by the enforcement entity, which does not have authority until July 1.', 'The power conferences are expected to soon announce the College Sports Commission, an organization tasked to oversee the settlement\'s terms and enforce new rules. The power conferences hired Deloitte and LBI, major players in revenue management for professional sports, to develop software to dissect NIL deals and track players\' revenue-sharing contracts. The CSC will police NIL deals over $600 with a new clearinghouse called ""NIL Go,"" sources told CBS Sports. Deloitte will use data from past endorsement deals with athletes to review boosters\' NIL deals and determine whether an agreement exceeds an athlete\'s fair market value.', 'Schools\' revenue-sharing payouts will be monitored by an enforcement arm called ""CAP,"" sources said. ', 'NIL deals under scrutiny will be subject to an arbitration process, which could speed up decisions on eligibility and penalties under the new system. The NCAA, which had become toothless in NIL enforcement as it was challenged legally state to state, will not be directly involved in enforcing NIL deals.', '""I certainly think that\'s something we\'ll have to work with on a coordinated basis, but on some level … that could be a really nice way – and it has an arbitration process, and it can do fact finding,"" NCAA president Charlie Baker said last week. ""There\'s a lot to like about that.""', 'Schools are expected to pay Deloitte as little as $5,000 or as much as $500,000 for the software, according to documents shared with athletic departments last week.', 'The newly-formed CSC released a statement shortly after the settlement was finalized with remarks from every power conference commisioner.', '""This is a significant moment for college athletics that will provide unparalleled opportunities for student-athletes,"" ACC commisioner Jim Phillips said.

So now more than ever we’ll see just how much athletic departments want to be football schools or basketball schools, and how they’ll go about striking that balance.', 'IU AD Scott Dolson came up as a manager with the basketball program, but he’s stated publicly on multiple occasions he thinks football is the economic engine of his department.  In the years to come, Indiana might try as hard as any school to thread the needle and find the sweet spot for both good football and basketball.', '“Football is important. Football drives so much revenue,” Dolson said last September.', '“That’s why Coach Cignetti is here. We need to be relevant in football. We need to make sure we get that momentum because it drives the engine for the whole department. Certainly men’s basketball speaks for itself as well, particularly here at Indiana, but football is really, really critical.”', 'So what impact might the recently approved House settlement have on Indiana?', 'On the whole, it looks better for football than basketball when it comes to the national landscape.', 'Schools are allowed to allocate $20.4 million of revenue to athletes as they see fit.  Most will likely give $2-4 million to men’s basketball players, and almost all of the rest to football players.', 'It won’t come as a surprise if IU gives more $5 million to basketball players, but there will still be a significant amount allocated to football players.  And that should help level the playing field for Indiana in a sport where they haven’t been competitive financially.  Really good football players should be able to come to IU and make really good money.  In general, IU should have enough money that the players they want can evaluate IU on the football opportunity as much as the financial opportunity.', 'Also coming with the House settlement is oversight for booster/collective payments to athletes.  This is the form of “NIL” we’ve seen over the last four years, where the schools with the richest and most motivated boosters can buy the best rosters.  Those payments will continue, but all of those deals will now be reviewed by Deloitte, and the sham element of payments will be disallowed.  Again, this should level the playing field for IU football, which has had collective cash, but not the silly money we’ve seen elsewhere.', 'To be determined is how Deloitte views the big brand programs across college football.  In other words, does the starting QB at Ohio State have a higher NIL value than the starter at Northwestern?  You can see the potential logic why that would be the case, along with the potential to permanently reinforce the hierarchy in college football.  That would be a scenario that would not help Indiana football, but continued high-level success by Curt Cignetti could help mitigate any concerns there.', 'Of course these very same considerations will help level a men’s basketball playing field where IU has had a financial advantage in recent years, along with one of the best national brands.', 'Now most high major men’s basketball programs should have at least a few million in their war chest, which will help them compete with IU.  And Indiana’s healthy amount of booster/collective money earmarked for men’s basketball will receive more scrutiny.', 'Another competitive layer in men’s basketball is the Big East Conference, as most of the schools in that league don’t have FBS football.  That could leave the vast majority of their revenue sharing resources to be directed almost exclusively to men’s basketball, giving them a significant advantage.  Of course without FBS football, there isn’t nearly as much revenue to share, so just how great the advantage is remains to be seen.  But we’ve already seen one coach — Kevin Willard — leave Maryland for Villanova in part due to greater financial promises.', 'The Big Ten does have the benefit of a massive television rights deal which should help at least offset some of the pain within the athletic department of the new $20 million expense.  It’s good to be in the Big Ten or SEC in this brave new world.', 'The Daily Hoosier –“Where Indiana fans assemble when they’re not at Assembly”', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNW5TekJrYVdWS1N6UlZMV1pKVFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdrZElJUlEwR09TeEFJ=-w280-h168-p-df

Conference commissioners bullish on new NIL enforcement,https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/45479869/conference-commissioners-bullish-enforcing-new-nil-rules,"['', 'Days after a multibillion-dollar legal settlement changed college athletics by allowing schools to directly pay their athletes, the most powerful conference commissioners are bullish on their ability to enforce NIL rules in a new system, even though specific punishments remain unclear.', 'Hours after the House v. NCAA settlement was approved on Friday, former MLB executive Bryan Seeley was named CEO of a new enforcement organization called the College Sports Commission. His job will be to lead the team responsible for enforcement of the new rules around revenue sharing, third-party payments to players for NIL deals, and roster limits.', 'One of the biggest questions, though, is what happens when those rules are broken?', 'ACC commissioner Jim Phillips, who spoke Monday on a Zoom news conference with fellow commissioners Greg Sankey (SEC), Tony Petitti (Big Ten), Brett Yormark (Big 12) and Teresa Gould (Pac-12), said they\'ve all had ideas, but nothing they\'re ""ready to come forward with."" Ultimately, Phillips said, the rules and boundaries will be under Seeley\'s purview.', '""We\'re in the process of developing some of those rules and structure and overall implementation of that,"" Phillips said. ""Now that we have Bryan on board, I think we\'ll be able to move a little bit quicker. But we want to get this right. It\'s one of those areas that until you have somebody leading the College Sports Commission, it\'s difficult to get together with that individual and start some of that framework that will be in place.""', 'Yormark called it ""progress over perfection,"" and said that while there will be challenges, they will meet them over time.', '""Our schools want rules, and we\'re providing rules, and we will be governed by those rules. And if you break those rules, the ramifications will be punitive,"" Yormark said.', 'The annual cap is expected to start at $20.5 million per school in 2025-26 and increase every year during the decade-long deal. Those payments will be in addition to scholarships and other benefits the athletes already receive. Starting June 7, players have to report NIL deals of $600 or more to the College Sports Commission.', 'LBi Software and accounting firm Deloitte will monitor salary cap management and the NIL clearinghouse, an online platform called NIL Go. Those NIL deals will be outside of the revenue directly shared by schools and will be vetted to determine if they are for a valid business purpose -- not recruiting.', ""Sankey met with his head coaches in football and men's and women's basketball this past February, and he said he has asked the same question at every level -- including up to the university presidents."", '""If you want an unregulated, open system, just raise your hand and let me know,"" Sankey said. ""And universally, the answer is, \'No, we want oversight. We want guardrails. We want structure.\' Those individuals don\'t have the luxury to just say that in meeting rooms, period. They don\'t have the luxury to just be anonymous sources. They have a responsibility to make what they\'ve sought -- what they\'ve asked for -- to make it work.""', 'The commissioners agreed, though, that in order to ""make it work,"" they need congressional help. Sankey, who said he played golf recently with President Donald Trump and Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua, continued to stress the need for an ""effort to preempt state laws.""', '""Congress exists to set national standards, and we\'re not going to have Final Fours and College Football Playoffs and College World Series with 50 different standards,"" Sankey said. ""Codification of at least settlement terms or around settlement terms would be enormously healthy.""', 'Sankey said he has always ""appreciated [Trump\'s] interest in college sports, ""and while it was ""helpful for me and Pete as well to hear his thoughts and his perspectives, and to share some of ours,"" he said those are ""best left for the moment on the golf course.""', 'Even with a multitude of questions still looming, Phillips said college athletics is in a ""much better place"" than it was 48 hours ago, before the settlement was approved.', '""What\'s not debatable is that this new model does bring stability and fairness to student-athletes in college sports,"" Phillips said, ""and we\'ve been in an unregulated environment with no rules and no enforcement.

But with a new clearinghouse managed by Deloitte set to begin, the settlement aims to limit pay-for-play activity by the booster collectives that funded rosters for the past four years.', 'It is a monumental shift in college sports, one that LSU has prepared for for nearly a year. Here’s what we know so far about the Tigers’ plans for this system.', 'Any school that opted into the settlement is allowed to pay an estimated maximum of $20.5 million during the 2025-26 academic year. That cap is expected to increase annually over the course of the 10-year settlement agreement because of rising revenues.', 'LSU running back Josh Williams (27) chats with LSU athletic director Scott Woodward following LSU’s 49-39 win over Missouri, Saturday, October 7, 2023, at Faurot Field on the campus of The University of Missouri in Columbia, Mo.', 'Each school can distribute the money as it sees fit, creating decisions about how to spread funds among multiple sports and players.', 'Similar to others in the SEC, LSU athletic director Scott Woodward told The Advocate in a recent interview that the Tigers would “roughly” follow the formula the settlement used to pay back $2.8 billion in damages to former players who could not profit off their NIL.', 'That means LSU plans to allocate 75% to football, 15% to men’s basketball, 5% to women’s basketball and 5% to the rest of its sports, including baseball and gymnastics. Up to $2.5 million in new scholarships will count against the cap.', ""“I don't see it changing drastically from there as far as revenue share goes,” Woodward said."", 'LSU football now has $13.5 million to spend in the upcoming academic year. Some of the money already was earmarked for players on the 2025 roster. Brian Kelly has said LSU reserved an unspecified amount for the 2026 team because payments operate on the academic calendar.', 'After paying football and basketball players, it’s unclear how LSU will divide the remaining 5% among the rest of its sports. Athletes will be under contract, though they are not yet considered employees.', 'Instead of using the NCAA, the power conferences created a new enforcement organization, the College Sports Commission, to monitor the legitimacy of the payments and make sure schools stay under the cap. The commission will be run by Bryan Seeley, a former MLB executive.', 'The other major result of the settlement was an attempt to regulate NIL payments by school-affiliated donor collectives, which funded rosters in the NIL era. The success of the salary cap hinges on restricting pay-for-play activity.', 'Every third-party NIL deal of more than $600 will have to go through the clearinghouse\'s online platform, NIL Go, which launches June 11. According to the commission\'s website, deals will be judged on whether or not they serve a “valid business purpose and do not exceed a reasonable range of compensation.""', 'If the deal is not cleared, players can revise the contract, cancel it or appeal the decision through an arbitration process. The commission\'s website noted ""if the student-athlete continues with the deal as submitted, they may face enforcement consequences, which could include loss of eligibility.""', 'There are questions about how effective this system will be, and the restrictions could lead to more lawsuits. But the idea is that it will limit spending by collectives. In this new system, the future of LSU’s collective, Bayou Traditions, is unclear.', ""Knowing those NIL deals would likely be denied by the clearinghouse, Bayou Traditions front-loaded contracts ahead of the settlement's approval. It planned to spend at least $10 million on the football team in the first half of 2025, money that will not factor into the revenue sharing cap."", 'The next recruiting battleground likely will take place over who can find legal ways to exceed the cap. With this in mind, LSU entered into a new agreement with its longtime multimedia-rights partner, Playfly Sports, to arrange NIL deals with its corporate partners.', 'There is hope among LSU athletics officials that finding legitimate NIL deals will give the Tigers an advantage because of their brand. Through the first three years of collectives, LSU football’s spending fell behind many of its SEC counterparts until a fundraising push took place over the past year.', 'But constantly asking donors for money to pay players is not viewed as a sustainable approach.', ""“We really have to focus on what we can do to help our student-athletes get into the third-party NIL world,” Woodward said. “That's where our focus is going to be with (the Tiger Athletic Foundation) and Bayou Traditions.”"", 'Instead of having a certain number of scholarships per sport — such as 11.7 in baseball — teams now operate under roster limits.

Baseball teams can carry 34 players.', 'It is up to every school to decide how many scholarships to fund, so there could still be space for walk-ons. The SEC maintained an 85-scholarship limit for its football teams for the time being, preserving 20 walk-on spots.', 'Wilken required the NCAA to grandfather current players into the roster limits so they don’t lose their places.

"Grant House Prevails in Landmark Settlement, But Olympic Sports Will Be Severely Affected",https://www.si.com/college/grant-house-prevails-in-landmark-settlement-but-olympic-sports-will-be-severely-affected,"['INDIANAPOLIS — Judge Claudia Wilken’s timing wasn’t intentional, but it certainly was exquisite. The morning after Wilken approved the settlement of the landmark House v. NCAA lawsuit that will revolutionize college sports, the named plaintiff in the suit was competing a mere four-minute walk from the front door of NCAA headquarters.', 'Grant House showed up at the IU Natatorium on Saturday morning to swim the 200-meter individual medley wearing a Gary Payton Seattle SuperSonics jersey, and at night for finals in a Rik Smits Indiana Pacers jersey. Those are two of many vintage NBA jerseys the swimmer owns. The 26-year-old former Arizona State Sun Devil can afford to buy more of them now if he so chooses after receiving a $125,000 “service award” in the settlement for putting his name on the suit. ', 'His name will resonate historically for reasons unrelated to his swimming. He’ll be famous for burning down the house of amateurism in college sports. When Wilken’s ruling dropped around 9:15 p.m. ET Friday, the symbolism of the moment did not escape him.', '“I was walking out of my brother Kyle’s hotel room with my family,” he tells Sports Illustrated. “It was actually very culminating to be wearing a Cassius Clay shirt, in Indianapolis, headquarters of the NCAA. It just felt right. It felt like the stars were aligned for that.', '“What Cassius Clay stood for in a different time period, and a much different demographic, was advocating for what’s right and standing against what’s wrong. I believe that’s what this whole [lawsuit] cause has been for, athlete advocacy. Having the courage to take one step forward for the sake of athletes now, from a couple years past, righting the wrongs that have been for decades, and then especially for the hundreds of thousands of athletes going forward.”', 'The unintended side effect of the House v. NCAA lawsuit might be setting fire to House’s chosen sport, and other Olympic sports.', 'Schools that opted into the House settlement will begin distributing up to $20.5 million to current athletes on July 1. The generally acknowledged breakdown of payments is along these parameters: 75% to football players, 15% to men’s basketball players, 5% to women’s basketball players and 5% to all other sports combined. Some Olympic sports in major athletic departments will receive none of the House revenue share at all. The billions of dollars from the settlement will not trickle down to the vast majority of college athletes.', 'At Southeastern Conference spring meetings last month, some schools said they will distribute revenue to six sports. Others have said it will be only three—football and the two basketball programs. Meanwhile, schools with lesser resources are not only not distributing revenue to Olympic sports, many are looking to deemphasize or even eliminate them.', 'Concerns about the future of college swimming hovered over the U.S. championships here. With the economics of college athletics tilting more toward a big-business mentality, everyone in this and every Olympic sport is worried about what the post-House landscape will be.', '“The elephant in the room is, what are the implications for Olympic sports?” says Louisville Cardinals swimming and diving coach Arthur Albiero, who is the president of the College Swim Coaches Association. “My concern is that the value of Olympic sports, that scale has shifted a little bit. Producing Olympians, All-Americans, great GPAs, great citizens—where does that fit into the metrics now? It’s a dire moment.”', 'Jaime Gordon, CEO of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said at a Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics forum last month that 32 individual sports have been dropped at the Division I level since the introduction of the House v. NCAA lawsuit in 2020. That has eliminated more than 900 D-I athletic opportunities, Gordon said, and that figure does not include St. Francis dropping its entire athletic program to Division III in ’26–27.', 'Former Penn State president Eric Barron, a Knight Commission member, declared the number of eliminated sports “a tragedy.” More eliminated programs seem inevitable over the lifespan of the House settlement, which covers 10 years.', 'For time immemorial, football and (sometimes) men’s basketball have funded entire athletic departments. This was a universally accepted revenue distribution at the higher education level—just as some academic departments attract more students and more tuition for a university than others. The departments that aren’t high earners aren’t eliminated by the school.', 'But as the revenue geyser has increased in football, so has the sport’s desire to keep what it earns and spend it. Coaching salaries have skyrocketed, the facilities arms race was uncontrolled—and over the last three years, the players have been getting paid higher and higher amounts. (Paid above the table. They were always getting kickbacks under it in the past.)', '“It’s a spending problem,” says Rocky Harris, chief of sport and athlete services at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “If you win in football, you need to invest more in it. If you lose in football, you need to invest more in it. It’s a never-ending problem.”', 'At the FBS level, Olympic sports are hoping to hold on to a couple of current thresholds: a minimum of 15 sponsored sports for each school, and estimated per-dollar spending in the range of 38 to 43 cents.', 'If those equations change, tilting more toward football and basketball, many universities could keep Olympic sports in name only. They could be virtual club sports, with facilities left to age, staff sizes and salaries diminished, recruiting and travel budgets slashed.', '“We know we have to invest in football and basketball, we fully understand that,” Albiero says. “And I believe those guys do need to be compensated—no problem with that whatsoever. But I do think the pendulum has swung a little too far, where Olympic sports are starting to suffer. ', '“Can we put some guardrails around our resources, so they can be somewhat protected, without taking away from other boxes that must be checked? The reality is, we need some help to protect Olympic sports, whether that’s from Congress or somewhere else.”', 'House acknowledges that Olympic sports are facing a new and somewhat uncertain future. The power-conference schools will be the last to drop those sports, but the tiers below them—the mid-major and low-major universities—are in the most immediate jeopardy.  ', 'Swimming, which is a lynchpin of American Olympic excellence and viewer interest once every four years, doesn’t move the needle the other three. The sport will have to be resourceful and creative to maintain a national presence on campuses beyond the top 25 programs.', '“The biggest thing is working together to handle these changes,” House says. “Making sure we’re working as a community—that’s when swimming is at its strongest. That’s why the sport is so amazing, because it’s so collaborative. The only constant in our life is change, so walking together into that change is important.”', 'House described walking into the natatorium—where he has competed at various times since he was 8 years old—and competing the day after the settlement as “cathartic.” A long journey into a strange sort of fame was over. He might even have looked at the NCAA building nearby in a new light.', '“It’s interesting the connotation it takes now,” he says. “But it’s still just a building you drive past at the end of the day. They don’t know I’m in the car, I don’t know who’s in the building—but I know what it stands for and what I stand for, and those aren’t the most collaborative forces right now.”', 'In the pool Saturday, House qualified fifth for the final of the 200 IM. At night, wearing the Smits jersey, he walked out behind Lane 2, shot an imaginary jump shot, then stripped down to his racing suit and dove in, hoping to finish in the top two and make the U.S. team for the World Championships later this summer in Singapore.', 'House finished fifth, missing the team by three places and 2.31 seconds but swimming a career-best time in the event. After a long warmdown, House changed, dried off and left the natatorium with his ASU teammates.', 'Literally and figuratively, his work here in Indy was done.', 'Pat Forde is a senior writer for Sports Illustrated who covers college football and college basketball as well as the Olympics and horse racing.

Judge approves landmark House v. NCAA settlement,https://www.on3.com/news/judge-approves-landmark-house-v-ncaa-settlement/,"['PeteNakos_', 'Fifty-nine months after the initial class-action House v. NCAA suit was filed, it has been resolved. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the House settlement on Friday in the U.S. Northern District of California, marking a landmark decision in the history of college sports.', 'Since the NCAA was founded in 1906, institutions have never directly paid athletes. That will now change with the settlement ushering in the revenue-sharing era of college sports. Beginning July 1, schools will be able to share $20.5 million with athletes, with football expected to receive 75%, followed by men’s basketball (15%), women’s basketball (5%) and the remainder of sports (5%). The amount shared in revenue will increase annually.', 'Power Four football programs will have roughly $13 to $16 million to spend on rosters for the 2025 season. Many schools have front-loaded contracts ahead of the settlement’s approval, taking advantage of contracts not being vetted by the newly formed NIL clearinghouse.', '“Despite some compromises, the settlement agreement nevertheless will result in extraordinary relief for members of the settlement classes,” Wilken wrote in her 76-page final opinion. “If approved, it would permit levels and types of student-athlete compensation that have never been permitted in the history of college sports, while also very generously compensating Division I student-athletes who suffered past harms.”', 'Instead of facing $20 billion in back damages, the NCAA and Power Five conferences signed off on a 10-year settlement agreement that includes $2.776 billion in back damages. The NCAA is responsible for paying the amount over the next decade – $277 million annually. Roughly 60% will come from a reduction in distribution to institutions. The NCAA is tasked with closing the other 40%, which will come through reducing operating expenses. Some of the top athletes in recent memory will make millions.', 'The settlement also imposes new restrictions on college sports. An NIL clearinghouse will be established, titled “NIL Go” and run through Deloitte. All third-party NIL deals of $600 or more must be approved by the clearinghouse. If not approved, the settlement says a new third-party arbiter could deem athletes ineligible or result in a school being fined. In a gathering at the ACC spring meetings last week, Deloitte officials reportedly shared that 70% of past deals from NIL collectives would have been denied, while 90% of past deals from public companies would have been approved.', 'Speaking with sources on Friday, On3 has learned that multiple schools are sending over rev-sharing contracts, so deals are getting signed as soon as midnight.', '“Because the alleged anticompetitive effect of the associated entity third-party NIL provisions has not been established, and because defendants advanced pro-competitive justifications for these NIL provisions at the final approval hearing, it is not clear that such provisions violate the Sherman Act under the rule of reason,” Wilken wrote in her decision on Friday. “Thus, the associated entity third-party NIL provisions do not preclude the court from granting final approval.”', 'Roster limits are also set to be introduced. Wilken recently pushed back on the limits automatically being put in place, stating that the House v. NCAA settlement would not move forward if roster spots were not grandfathered in. NCAA and power conference attorneys, along with plaintiffs’ attorneys, agreed on a plan to phase in roster limits.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Under the plan, athletes who had their positions cut will be eligible for reinstatement at schools’ discretion. It also permits athletes who leave or are not retained by their current school would keep grandfather status at a new school. Proposed rosters include football (105), men’s and women’s basketball (15), baseball (34), men’s and women’s soccer (28), softball (25) and volleyball (18).', 'And while the settlement will usher in a new era of college sports, plenty of questions continue to linger. Drafted conference membership contracts are circulating at the Power Four level. The agreements spell out that institutions must waive their right to sue the College Sports Commission, the new enforcement entity to be created following the House v. NCAA settlement approval.', 'The contracts are a direct shot at Tennessee’s new state law, which allows schools and their NIL collectives to continue to pay above the cap, creating a competitive advantage. Not signing the membership agreement could result in schools being kicked out of their conferences or risk being blackballed by the rest of the Power Four. The College Sports Commission, run by the Power Four, is also expected to hire a commissioner. Major League Baseball executive Bryan Seeley will take the role, the commission announced late Friday.', 'Many across college sports have expressed doubt that the settlement will be able to halt third-party NIL collective payments. Sources expect lawsuits surrounding Title IX, the rev-sharing salary cap and the newly founded NIL clearinghouse to be filed.', 'In a letter published on Friday night, NCAA president Charlie Baker called the settlement “a new beginning” for the governing body.', '“Together, we can use this new beginning to launch college sports into the future,” Baker wrote in the letter to the membership. “… In the weeks ahead, we will work to show Congress why the settlement is both a massive win for student-athletes and a road map to legislative reform.”', 'Kentucky assistant to Louisville', 'ESPN predicts order of finish', 'Ranks Top 12 teams', 'Plans to leave Auburn baseball', 'Politician pleads with Trump', '© 2025 On3 Media, Inc.

Five hot takes from landmark House v. NCAA settlement: Parity boom ahead as big dogs may start to go hungry,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/five-hot-takes-from-landmark-house-v-ncaa-settlement-parity-boom-ahead-as-big-dogs-may-start-to-go-hungry/,"['', ""It's been coming down the pipe for years, but it finally happened -- college athletics has forever changed with revenue sharing thanks to the House v. NCAA settlement. Now, the door's been removed from its hinges for a new era in what was formerly known as amateur sports."", ""Last week's $2.8 billion, 10-year settlement ushers in backpay for previous student-athletes who missed out on name, image and likeness opportunities and beginning July 1, colleges are allowed to pay current players directly. There's an expected $20.5 million on the table per school to share with their players in the upcoming academic year with a new revenue sharing cap that increases by at least 4% every year -- except Years 4, 7 and 10 when Power Four revenue baselines are determined -- for the next decade."", ""Most of the money will be earmarked for football (estimated 75%) and men's basketball (~15%), with the rest being dispersed to women's basketball (~5%) and other sports (~5%). "", ""Here's a couple quick opinions on the landmark decision and how things may look moving forward:"", ""TCU reaching the national championship game a few years ago piqued interest, as did Cincinnati and Boise State reaching the playoff as Group of Five surprises. Should we expect more of the same in the coming years? If you're fans of a Power Four program, you bet, and at a few others, there's an enhanced chance for annual success. Glancing at the recruiting powerhouses within college football and basketball in the modern era, most have various factors in common: rich history, incentivized exposure and an opportunity to star at the highest level. You can wear a blindfold and generally guess how many five-stars Duke will sign on the hardwood or Georgia's placement at the top of the SEC's food chain."", 'However, since the playing field will be closer to level financially, it\'s no guarantee a five-star quarterback would sign with Ohio State over Maryland moving forward, for example, if the Terps are offering a more handsome contract through direct revenue sharing. While the notion of the Buckeyes ""buying"" their national championship last season with a reported $20 million roster received pushback, Ohio State\'s no longer one of the only handful of programs who can afford payroll that expansive in the new era. ', ""We've already seen early reminders at the top of the recruiting board for the nation's best players the last two cycles that all the prized fish aren't necessarily being lured by the the title-contending, biggest yachts in the sea. Per 247Sports' individual player rankings, 25 different Power Four programs have signed at least one five-star since 2024's early signing period. That number dwarfs the five-star disparity across the modern era in any other two-year sample size. SMU, Georgia Tech, Nebraska, Texas Tech and Colorado are among the programs who have landed their highest-rated prep signee ever during that stretch."", 'Casuals say preseason polls are meaningless, right? Well, media shapes the national discussion every offseason and there\'s a certain expectation for teams inside the top 15 every year to show out. There\'s a built-in bias there from bluebloods getting the benefit of the doubt thanks to the same dozen or so programs signing the top talent year after year. That\'s going to change with revenue sharing. Teams will have to consider their ""payroll"" or sorts and determine where money will be spent and at what positions. ', ""During the first year of the expanded playoff, three SEC teams who were ranked throughout the regular season missed out on the bracket with three losses, including playoff mainstay Alabama. Why do you think SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and others from the Big Ten are advocating for four auto-bids from those leagues in the next portion of playoff expansion and harping on strength of schedule? It's growing increasingly more difficult to go unbeaten with better balanced schedules and more competitive conferences from top to bottom, and that's going to continue with revenue used to fund rosters."", ""In December, college basketball's top recruit, AJ Dybantsa, committed to BYU over traditional power Kansas and North Carolina in an unprecedented move. Part of the Tar Heels' sales pitch to Dybantsa was the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of Michael Jordan and Vince Carter, along with spotlighting the potential of future career earnings through endorsements deals like Zion Williamson's contract with Nike after he starred at Duke over in-state finalist -- and non-traditional power -- Clemson."", ""Instead, BYU was able to match Dybantsa's reported asking price of $5 million through its collective, and that deal is considered the largest for any incoming college basketball player ever. Moreover, transfer portal signings have further shifted the balance of power in college basketball, and the days of the top-five teams in the country gobbling up all the elite signings are evaporating."", 'What happens when boosters figure out their massive annual contributions to a football program may not result in an automatic nationally ranked finish that carries playoff buzz every December? It\'s coming. We\'ve already seen athletic directors and figureheads at elite programs asking fans to ""fight back"" and help fund respective rosters with the talent disparity shrinking within major conferences. With this new revenue sharing commitment that all Power Four programs are dealing with, where\'s the ROI for the most deep-pocketed donors? ', ""We've already seen a groundswell of schools using social media to rally its fanbases and ask for donations after big wins or momentum-changing announcements. How often over the last year alone have you seen fans complaining about funding salaries for players, many of whom are signing year-to-year deals and wanting an enhanced contract at its conclusion? Without a sense a loyalty and the transfer portal being a dip into free agency, it seems many fans -- and worst-case scenario, boosters -- could become disinterested in donating to the cause. "", 'The last thing these major programs across football and basketball want is wide variance in booster support if those contributors are unwilling to assist in funding annual rosters and tossing extra funds on top of what schools receive through TV contracts, conference revenue dispersement, ticket sales and other guarantees. All this being said, you can still the football-first entities around college sports -- programs like Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia, etc. -- to have higher budgets than others.', 'Those within NIL offices have to be sweating right now. How about the ""agents"" who have reaped the benefits of unregulated NIL over the last few recruiting cycles? There\'s a ""fair market"" review process in place now for third-party deals, and there will be enhanced scrutiny on partnerships thanks to the College Sports Commission (CSC), an oversight arm of sorts. With virtually no parameters previously, pay-for-play checks that were hidden as marketing agreements in the past must pass the sniff test with these changes. ', 'NIL is not being eliminated, but it will be curbed and its impact far less important thanks to the rules adjustments and players having opportunities elsewhere through revenue sharing that could be far more lucrative. ', 'Various reports indicate collectives hurried to finalize multi-million dollar with franchise-caliber players before this House settlement ahead of the July 1 switch. Any athlete who receives $600 or more through an NIL deal must report that partnership to the new enforcement arm later this summer. The contract will then be further evaluated to determine if the NIL parameters meet a ""valid business purpose"" and are within ""a reasonable range of compensation."" How that is defined in terms of legitimacy, no one knows.', 'As CBS Sports\' Brandon Marcello appropriately put it, ""the NCAA\'s 119-year amateurism model died Friday with a judge\'s pen,"" and he\'s right. Any key contributor for your favorite college football or basketball team moving forward will be paid, handsomely, with ""cost of attendance"" being a laughable phrase from yesteryear. Those stale arguments about tuition, housing and meals provided to scholarship athletes being enough are extinct and, bluntly, have been for years. ', ""While most agree paying college players is long overdue with events like the College Football Playoff and NCAA Tournament generating hundreds of millions, there was an essence of purity within intercollegiate athletics that brought a special sense of pride to the playing field. Let's stop pretending any of that was authentic in recent years."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.', 'CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Formally unveiled just hours after the final-approval ruling was released, the Commission will be responsible for the implementing, overseeing and enforcing schools' compliance with the settlement’s terms."", 'Sankey pledged that cooperation will occur because school CEO’s, athletics directors and coaches have grown weary of what has become a largely marketplace of athletes being able to transfer schools multiple times without penalty and seek the best financial terms from school-affiliated collectives or, in deals that were contingent on the settlement’s final approval, the schools themselves.', ""“I've asked at every level … our university presidents and chancellors, our athletics directors, our head coaches: If you want an unregulated, open system, just raise your hand and let me know,” Sankey said. “And universally, the answer is: ‘No. We want oversight. We want guardrails. We want structures.’"", ""“Those individuals don't have the luxury to just say that in meeting rooms. Period. They don't have the luxury to just be anonymous sources They have a responsibility to make what they've sought, what they've asked for -- to make it work."", "" “I'm speaking from one perspective. My expectation is everybody on this video conference has had that same dialogue. And, so, some of this burden shifts back to make this work. And we should be candid about the expectation that's been established from our members, each of us, and the commitment that we've made to make this work.”"", ""HEAVY BURDEN: House settlement won't work if schools decide to cheat"", 'Those terms include an annual cap on the amount of money that schools will be able to spend on direct NIL deals with their athletes and a system under which athletes’ NIL deals worth more than $600 will have to be reported and then evaluated to determine whether a deal has a “valid business purpose” and is within “a reasonable range of compensation.”', 'Schools, administrators and coaches are always looking for an edge on their competitors, and, in recent years, they have become increasingly hostile toward investigations and enforcement from the NCAA.', 'Sankey and the Big 12’s Brett Yormark both said they expect there will “challenges” with the new system.', ""“But,” said Yormark, “we will meet those challenges and we'll address them appropriately. …"", '""I\'ll also say that our schools want rules and we\'re providing rules, and we will be governed by those rules. And if you break those rules, you know, the ramifications will be punitive.”', 'Meanwhile, Sankey, who confirmed that he and Notre Dame AD Pete Bevacqua played golf with President Donald Trump over the weekend, maintained that even with the settlement, federal intervention in college sports is necessary.', ""“Congress exists to set national standards,” Sankey said, “and we're not going to have Final Fours and College Football Playoffs and College World Series with 50 different standards. So that's the starting point.”"", 'Sankey also said that he believes Congress can pass a college-sports bill, even amid a turbulent and divisive political climate.', ""“They do have the ability to get things done, even in difficult political times,” Sankey said. “And I think this is a nonpartisan issue, candidly. I don't think this is about drawing lines between Democrats and Republicans or the House and Senate. I think this is an opportunity for our governmental leaders, our political leaders, to come together around solutions to support our Olympic development program, to support college football and every one of our sports that flows off of that, including those that are labeled as non-revenue sports.”"", 'Sankey’s analysis may be optimistic. In the Senate, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who now chairs the chamber’s Commerce Committee, and Democrats led by Sens. Cory Booker, N.J., and Richard Blumenthal, Conn., have been trying to craft college-sports bills for several years, but have not been able to come to terms. The points of disagreement have included the degree of legal protections the NCAA, the conferences and school want, and the types of benefits for athletes that would become enshrined in law, as opposed to the NCAA’s or conference’s rules books.', ""However, the Big Ten’s Tony Petitti, expressed optimism that the settlement’s final approval may help the NCAA’s and the conferences’ case. And the commissioner's noted that another hearing is upcoming this week — one by the a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.."", ""“We've shown that we're willing to make significant change and modernize our system,” Petitti said. “We're not just asking for something.

Which Kirby Smart-era players would’ve earned the biggest piece of a House settlement salary cap?,https://www.dawgnation.com/football/around-the-dawghouse/these-5-players-wouldve-been-highest-paid-players-kirby-smart-era-terms-salary-cap/FCBOJ5Y2CBHAPOE4HQJMRXTYWA/,"['Welcome to ""Around the DawgHouse"" where we update you multiple times each week on the latest news and information from the different sports. Around The DawgHouse is also a daily feature on DawgNation Daily.', 'Much of the House settlement is forward-leaning, as schools are now able to engage in revenue sharing with active players.', 'But a key part of the settlement is also the $2.8 billion that schools will be paying athletes who competed from 2016 through 2024.', 'Those years conveniently dovetail with Kirby Smart’s time in Athens, as 2016 was his first season in charge.', 'The Bulldogs have produced tons of talented players over that span. In the five most recent NFL drafts, no program has put more players into the NFL than Georgia’s 55. Smart has more first-round draft picks, 20, in his time at Georgia than losses.', 'So which recent Georgia greats would’ve commanded the largest share of the salary cap, had it been in place for Smart’s previous teams? Below are the five guys we think would’ve commanded the highest annual payout.', 'It’s important to keep in mind this isn’t just a list of who had the best season. Positional value matters, as you’re going to pay a quarterback more than you would a running back, and a cornerback more than you would a safety. It’s also important to remember that players who have had multiple great seasons would’ve had better leverage. Roquan Smith’s 2017 season could well be the best individual season anyone has had under Smart but the player he was at the end of that season was not who he was viewed as at the beginning of the year.', 'Tight end Brock Bowers going into the 2023 season:', 'Yes, we touched on positional value earlier in this piece and tight ends rarely commanded a massive salary.', 'But Bowers is the exception to the rule. He’s arguably the best player Smart has coached and his impact on the program is without question.', 'While some may question making a tight end one of your highest-paid players, it’s important to keep in mind that no one worked harder than Bowers did in his time in Athens. And there are undoubtedly trickle-down benefits that come when your highest-paid player is also your best one.', 'Offensive tackle Andrew Thomas going into the 2019 season:', 'Georgia has had a number of great offensive tackles roll through the program in recent years. Thomas is one of five offensive tackles to play for Smart who became first-round picks.', 'You could’ve gone with Broderick Jones entering the 2022 season or even Amarius Mims going into the 2023 season. But Thomas was significantly more proven than either of those players.', 'Much like Bowers, Thomas checked all the boxes when it came to being wired the right way. The only Georgia player to be drafted higher than Thomas was Travon Walker, who went with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Thomas was the No. 4 pick in the 2020 draft cycle.', 'Wide receiver George Pickens going into the 2021 season:', 'Georgia’s 2021 team had a legendary defense. Perhaps Smart would’ve signed off on giving Jordan Davis more, given his leadership abilities and the fact that he bypassed the NFL draft for another year.', 'But coming out of that season, Pickens was a massive star and someone who could open up so much for an offense. When he and JT Daniels were on the field together, the two proved to be incredibly dynamic.', 'Of course, Pickens’ 2021 season shows just how tricky this new era of college football will be. He tore his ACL in March of that year and didn’t return until the team’s final regular season game against Georiga Tech. He had just 5 receptions in 4 games that season.', 'Defensive tackle Jalen Carter going into the 2022 season:', 'Georgia’s defense lost a ton coming off of the 2021 National Championship season. But it brought back major star power in Carter.', 'His talent has never been in question and when he was on the field in 2022, he was often the most disruptive player on the field. His sack of Jayden Daniels in the 2022 SEC Championship Game is one of the defining images of that team.', 'Nolan Smith would’ve commanded a high salary that season as well, given his importance as a leader and edge defender. But Carter has a strong case as the most talented defender to play for Smart. His cap hit this season would’ve reflected that.', 'Quarterback Carson Beck going into the 2024 season:', 'Because of the importance of the position, quarterback is going to more often than not be the highest-paid position on the team.', 'Jake Fromm would’ve had a case for it going into 2019, especially after Justin Fields transferred. JT Daniels would’ve been a big-time earner on the 2021 team. Stetson Bennett would’ve been a fascinating case heading into the 2022 season.', 'But there’s little doubt that Beck would’ve earned more than all of them. Georgia needed Beck to elevate the offense and he put forth a very strong 2023 season when he had Brock Bowers and Ladd McConkey at his disposal.', 'The 2024 season though did not play out how Beck or Georgia envisioned. His interceptions doubled from 6 to 12 while his completion percentage sagged. Georgia put too much on Beck’s shoulders last season.', 'Even with the regression from Beck, Miami still made him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the sport this offseason. And that is even after suffering a season-ending elbow injury with the Bulldogs.', 'Honorable mention: 2017 Nick Chubb, 2017 Roquan Smith, 2018 Deandre Baker, 2019 Jake Fromm, 2019 D’Andre Swift, 2020 Richard LeCounte, 2020 Eric Stokes, 2021 JT Daniels, 2021 Jordan Davis, 2021 Travon Walker, 2021 Nakobe Dean, 2022 Nolan Smith, 2022 Stetson Bennett, 2022 Broderick Jones, 2023 Amarius Mims, 2024 Mykel Williams, 2024 Malaki Starks, 2024 Jalon Walker', 'Georgia Football Podcast: Landmark legal settlement brings big …', 'Athletic Director Josh Brooks shares how Georgia is set up to handle …', 'BREAKING: 3-star OL Zach Lewis commits to Georgia football', 'Judge grants final approval to House vs. NCAA: What it means for …', 'Alex Huntley: South Carolina DT commit will likely give UGA an …', 'We have a new way to comment on our DawgNation stories.

Paul Finebaum: House settlement will only help the rich in college athletics,https://www.on3.com/news/paul-finebaum-house-settlement-will-only-help-the-rich-in-college-athletics/,"['ChandlerVessels', 'Paul Finebaum gave a stern warning about the implications that the recently approved House vs. NCAA settlement will have on college athletics. It is set to bring a wave of changes to the sport, most notably allowing universities to directly pay athletes for the first time ever.', 'But according to Finebaum, it might not have the desired impact save for the two most powerful conferences in the sport already, the SEC and Big Ten. He believes those schools will see bigger benefits as well as bigger pay days as a result of the new changes while the remaining conferences will be left picking up the scraps. He also worried how it might affect sports outside of football and men’s basketball.', '“It means very little, really,” Finebaum said on the Dan Patrick Show. “This is all very complicated. A lot of legal mumbo jumbo. What I think it will really mean, though, if you’re a fan of a Group of 5 school, if you’re a fan of a school somewhere in the middle, get ready for hard times.', '“This is only going to help the rich. The big leagues, the Big Ten, the SEC will more than likely profit because they have so much money. Women’s sports, in my opinion, will be hurt. Olympic sports will be crushed. Football wins. Basketball, other than maybe the Big East, takes a slight backseat.”', 'Direct payments to players isn’t the only change coming as a result of the new settlement. There will also be set roster limits for each sport as well as an NIL clearinghouse for deals greater than $600.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Ultimately, Paul Finebaum sees this possibly being the final nail in the coffin for the NCAA. The organization has already been losing power due to all the recent changes and Sankey revealed at the SEC Spring Meetings that people within the SEC have brought up the possibility of separating from the NCAA entirely.', 'This settlement only makes that an even stronger possibility. However, as Finebaum mentioned, one has to wonder what that could mean for a vast majority of other schools left in the wake.', '“The NCAA is essentially dead and I know a lot of people are celebrating,” he said. “But the damage that has been done by this organization is incalculable and it’s really about time. What did we grow up thinking about when we thought of the NCAA? The enforcement part of it. The big, bad NCAA is coming to your town. They don’t even have any jurisdiction for that any more.', '“By the way, not that they have in about the last five years. They’ve been completely ineffective. So if you’re the NCAA president, who happens to be Charlie Baker, you get to fly around on a luxury plane, you’re welcomed at Taj Mahal, you stay at five-star resorts.
