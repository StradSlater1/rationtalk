Welcome to Aaron Rodgers’s Final Chapter,https://www.theringer.com/2025/06/06/nfl/aaron-rodgers-signs-pittsburgh-steelers-mike-tomlin-arthur-smith-dk-metcalf,"['Since Ben Roethlisberger’s retirement in 2022, six quarterbacks have taken dropbacks for the Pittsburgh Steelers: Russell Wilson, Justin Fields, Kenny Pickett, Mason Rudolph, and Kyle Allen. Presumably, after agreeing on Thursday to a one-year deal and ending a monthslong saga of will he or won’t he, Aaron Rodgers will be the seventh quarterback to try to fill what has been a glaring void at the sport’s most important position. ', 'It feels like the Steelers are back where they were before the turn of the decade, at the tail end of Roethlisberger’s career, with a decent supporting cast surrounding a once-great quarterback with waning physical abilities. I’ll forgive you if you’ve deleted the memories of Roethlisberger’s final two seasons from your brain’s cache. By that point, he had lost most of his arm strength, all of his mobility, and any desire to take a hit. His demands on how the Steelers offense should operate around him were as strong as ever, though. And placating an aging Roethlisberger seemed to take precedence over fielding a productive offense, and the results were predictably bad, if not comical at times. ', '', 'Aaron Rodgers Signs With the Pittsburgh Steelers', '', 'Even if the quarterbacking was bad, Roethlisberger had earned the right to retire on his terms. He had led the franchise to two Super Bowl titles while breaking numerous passing records along the way. His strong influence over the offense made some sense because when Roethlisberger was at or near the top of his game, it paid dividends on the field. Rodgers is joining the Steelers with an equally impressive career résumé, but none of it was accomplished in Pittsburgh. Given what we know about Rodgers—which is frankly too much at this point—that probably won’t make much of a difference to the quarterback. He will likely demand the same level of control over the offensive scheme that Roethlisberger had over the last decade of his career. And given how the Steelers have been willing to put their offseason plans on hold while Rodgers contemplated retirement after his release from the Jets, it feels likely that he’ll get it. Whether the 41-year-old former MVP is still worthy of that respect will ultimately determine how successful this seemingly doomed partnership will be, and whether this is the move that will pull Pittsburgh out of QB purgatory. ', 'A cursory look at Rodgers’s final 2024 statline might convince you that he’s still got plenty left in the tank. He threw for 3,897 yards with a solid touchdown-to-interception ratio of 28-to-11. Pro Football Focus credited him with 26 “big-time throws” against 12 “turnover-worthy plays,” putting him ahead of Patrick Mahomes, and just outside of the top 10, in both categories. There’s a statistical case that Rodgers’s lone season as the Jets’ starting quarterback wasn’t nearly as bad as you remember. That case would be misleading. The advanced (and more reliable) metrics paint a much more bleak and realistic picture. Rodgers finished 26th in EPA per dropback and 25th in both passing success rate and QBR. Sure, he was playing behind a bad offensive line, which would drag down the numbers of any quarterback, but Rodgers put up bottom-of-the-league numbers even from a clean pocket. Only Tennessee’s Will Levis, who was ultimately benched for Pittsburgh’s current backup, Rudolph, had a lower EPA average on unpressured dropbacks last season, per TruMedia.  ', '', '', 'The strongest sign that Rodgers is a far cry from the quarterback who won back-to-back MVP awards in 2020 and 2021 can be found in his stats when facing pressure. Nearly a quarter of his pressured dropbacks last season turned into sacks, and he averaged just over 3.1 yards on those plays. A deep dive into his film leads to a similar conclusion: Rodgers is no longer the creative force he was at his  peak. When the pocket breaks down, Rodgers breaks down. Even if he manages to escape the rush, the 40-something QB with a surgically repaired Achilles tendon doesn’t pose much of a threat with his legs. What was once a hallmark of his game is his most significant area of weakness. Now, he’s more likely to just tap out on a play that isn’t going as planned. Only Bo Nix threw more checkdowns last season, according to Pro Football Focus; those safe passes may have padded Rodgers’s completion percentage and kept his interception total down, but they were not part of an efficient offense.', 'The deeper Rodgers got into a play, the worse he played. He was at his best when the ball was coming out of his hand quickly, whether it was on short, timing-based throws or vertical shots to the perimeter, which were often dictated by the pre-snap defensive look. If you watched only a cut-up of Rodgers when he was dealing in quick-game concepts or throwing downfield outside of the numbers, you might come away thinking the guy still has plenty of juice in his arm.', 'Just don’t watch any of the other throws if you want to hold on to that hope. Rodgers’s loss of downfield precision was most glaring when he attacked the intermediate areas of the field, the type of passes that would show off his accuracy and zip during his MVP-winning days in Green Bay. Last season, on throws aimed 10-to-19 yards downfield and made from a clean pocket, Rodgers’s uncatchable throw rate spiked to 39.6 percent. That’s a 14-point jump from his 2022 season and a 17-point jump compared to 2021. The version of Rodgers who routinely pulled off absurd throws like this seems to no longer exist. ', 'Rodgers has lost a few mph off his fastball and his top running speed, but there are still some qualities the Steelers can conceivably build a productive offense around. He may no longer be a star quarterback capable of elevating a middling supporting cast, but he can still get it done as a game manager thanks to his quick processing and accuracy on throws with a lower degree of difficulty. ', 'There was a time when it felt like even mediocre quarterback play would be enough to get the Steelers over the hump and end Mike Tomlin’s playoff win drought. That’s probably no longer the case. Pittsburgh did reshape its receiving corps over the offseason, shipping malcontent George Pickens off to Dallas and bringing in DK Metcalf and Robert Woods, but that feels like the Alex Jones before-and-after meme, to put it in terms that a guy like Rodgers can appreciate. Pittsburgh also let Najee Harris, a first-round pick, walk in free agency after a disappointing stint as the team’s lead running back and will seemingly give his former backup, Jaylen Warren, the first crack at replacing him—unless third-round rookie Kaleb Johnson beats Warren out for the job. The young offensive line should be improved in 2025, but it did lose a key contributor in offensive tackle Dan Moore to free agency. The tight end group, led by Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington, could be another strength that offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will lean on heavily, but this isn’t exactly a world-beating group of skill players the Steelers are putting around Rodgers. And nobody would be surprised if Rodgers eventually forces a trade for one of his buddies, and Randall Cobb is getting third-down targets by November.', 'It’s not a given that Pittsburgh’s defense will be a strength in 2025, either. Not after the unit imploded down the stretch last season, with stars T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward throwing not-so-veiled shots at their teammates. As impotent as the offense was in key games down the stretch, the defense didn’t fare much better, giving up 38 points to the Bengals, 27 to the Eagles, 34 to the Ravens, and 29 to the Chiefs before Baltimore ran them off the field in a 28-14 loss in the wild-card round. The team did use a first-round pick on defensive end Derrick Harmon and brought in veteran cornerback Darius Slay to play opposite of Joey Porter Jr., but Harmon is just a rookie, and Slay is well past his prime.', 'The roster is no longer just a quarterback away. And if Rodgers is no longer a quarterback who can elevate what’s around him—and all of the evidence suggests this is the case—it will be on the coaching staff to carry out that job. Whether Smith’s play calling is good enough to turn Rodgers into a productive quarterback again remains to be seen, but Smith does have a track record of getting the most out of his quarterbacks. In Tennessee, he rejuvenated Ryan Tannehill’s career (with a lot of help from Derrick Henry). The team results weren’t good in Atlanta, but he got efficient quarterback play from Marcus Mariota. And his most impressive feat to date may have been extracting mediocre results from Wilson and Fields last season. ', 'But Smith’s brand of offense, built around heavy personnel groups, condensed alignments, and sequenced play calling, isn’t what Rodgers has preferred throughout his career, even if he’ll find it familiar. Smith worked under Matt LaFleur in Tennessee before LaFleur left to take the Packers job. While there are some differences between Smith’s and LaFleur’s offenses, the general structure is the same and Rodgers played some of the best ball of his career in LaFleur’s version of the scheme. But it took some time for Rodgers and LaFleur to find the right balance between the scheme and what made the quarterback most comfortable. And there was some initial tension as Rodgers advocated for more control at the line of scrimmage. “The audible thing,” as LaFleur referred to it, was the big hurdle the two had to clear. ', '“I don’t think you want to ask me to turn off 11 years [of recognizing defenses]. … It’s just the other stuff that really not many people in this league can do,” Rodgers said during the 2019 offseason. “That’s not like a humblebrag or anything; that’s just a fact. There aren’t many people that can do at the line of scrimmage what I’ve done over the years. … There are a few of us who’ve just done it; it’s kind of second nature. And that’s just the icing on the cake for what I can do in this offense.”', 'LaFleur seemed to agree—despite his reluctance to give Rodgers full control of the offense. “We’re running a system I first picked up while working with Kyle [Shanahan] in Houston a decade ago, and we’ve never really had a quarterback who’s had complete freedom to change plays at the line, because that’s not really the way the offense is set up,” LaFleur said back in 2019. “But, I mean, this is Aaron Rodgers. He’s had a lot of freedom to make those calls, and deservedly so.”', 'At the time, “but it’s Aaron Rodgers” was a convincing enough argument to make significant alterations to a successful offensive scheme. That is no longer the case in 2025. As we saw in New York, where the veteran quarterback acted as shadow offensive coordinator while his buddy Nathaniel Hackett held the official title, the Aaron Rodgers Offense doesn’t work like it used to. If Rodgers intends to bring his ideal scheme to Pittsburgh, we can just fast-forward through these next six months and get right to the inevitable breakup. ', 'Having lived through the final years of Roethlisberger’s career, Tomlin and the Steelers should already know how things will end if they allow Rodgers to shape the offense to his liking. Maybe Tomlin is the coach who finally pushes back against the future Hall of Famer and gets him to fall in line, but he wasn’t able to do it with Roethlisberger. For this to work, it will be up to Rodgers to recognize that he’s no longer that guy, which will require a level of humility he has yet to show in his career. Tomlin has pulled off some impressive coaching jobs throughout his time in Pittsburgh. Getting Rodgers to fall in line and run the offense as designed may be his biggest challenge yet. It’s undoubtedly the most important one for next season.\nEnd of article', 'Yep, we have one too', 'By submitting, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy.', 'Most Read', 'The Knicks Ran Out of Gas—So They Lit the Car on Fire', 'The 2025 NBA Finals Entrance Survey', 'Lane Kiffin Crossed a Line.

Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards, which was good enough for eighth-best in the entire NFL. He was only 31 yards behind Patrick Mahomes for seventh.  ', 'Rodgers also finished eighth in touchdowns with 28 to go along with 11 interceptions.

', ""It's also only fair to take into account that Rodgers did open the year recovering from his Achilles injury that he suffered a few plays into the 2023 season. "", 'And after the Steelers added DK Metcalf and traded away George Pickens, a veteran like Rodgers could be the perfect person to try to get the most out of the receiver room as a whole. ', ""But most importantly, when trying to contextualize the Steelers' decision to sign Rodgers, there is an argument that he was the best available in a pretty weak market. Rodgers also won't try to hang around too long due to his advanced age, so everyone involved should be on the same page, knowing he's just a bridge option until Pittsburgh can find its next franchise guy.  "", 'Simply put, Rodgers is an upgrade, granted only a temporary one, from what the Steelers have had in recent years. ', 'Cons ', 'The problem with signing Rodgers extends far beyond what goes on between the lines. The full Rodgers experience is only partly about football.

"", 'From his political rants to his bizarre comments that turn into headlines to his appearances on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" Rodgers is a lightning rod who can\'t help himself. Many even feel he\'s a narcissist who truly believes he\'s the smartest guy in every room.

Emailed daily. Always free!', 'The Las Vegas Raiders made several major changes during the 2025 NFL offseason. This was because the team brought in new leadership in the form of general manager John Spytek and head coach Pete Carroll. While the move to hire these two was praised around the league, several of the decisions that Spytek and Carroll made during free agency were met with skepticism from Raider Nation. Perhaps the most scrutinized choice was letting linebackers Robert Spillane and Divine Deablo find new homes and replacing them with cheap veterans like Elandon Roberts and Devin White. Both signed one-year deals with little-to-no guaranteed money. Roberts is a nine-year NFL veteran who won two Super Bowls with the New England Patriots in the the mid-2010s. He racked up 206 tackles and 4.0 sacks during his four-year stint with the Patriots before making stops with the Miami Dolphins and Pittsburgh Steelers. After two years with the Steelers, Roberts opted to join Las Vegas on a $3 million deal in March. On Tuesday, he was a guest on an episode of ""The Rush With Maxx Crosby"" and spoke about his decision to join the Raiders this offseason. ""When I got that phone call to come to the Raiders and knowing what’s being built, I was just like ‘Yeah, no lie … I’m back feeling young,” Roberts said. “Even in free agency, that’s literally why I came to Vegas. Yeah I want to win a Super Bowl."" Roberts has 13 playoff games under his belt and has 53 postseason tackles to his name. This kind of winning pedigree and experience will be pivotal to a Raiders team that is trying to find their footing in a brutal AFC conference. All told, Roberts has over 600 career tackles in the NFL, 54 of which were for a loss. He has also tacked on 14.5 sacks, 12 passes defended, five forced fumbles and an 85-yard interception returned for a touchdown, which, coincidentally, came against Las Vegas in 2021. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham will, once again, have to teach a new linebacker how to operate in his defense. However, based on Roberts\' NFL success and Graham\'s track record of getting the most out of his players, this should be a great pairing for the Silver and Black during the 2025 season.', 'The Braves are shaking up their bullpen after a heartbreaking loss. David O’Brien of The Athletic reports that the club is going to select right-hander Craig Kimbrel and recall left-hander Dylan Dodd. In corresponding moves, right-hander Daysbel Hernández will land on the 15-day injured list, while righty Scott Blewett will be designated for assignment. The Kimbrel move was reported earlier Thursday. Blewett unfortunately lived up to his name, leading to a deluge of social media jokes at his expense. Atlanta was leading Thursday afternoon’s game against Arizona 9-3 through seven innings. Blewett was put into the game in the eighth and allowed one run, making it 9-4. Atlanta got that run back in the bottom of the eighth, making it 10-4. Blewett was sent back out for the ninth with a six-run lead to protect and three outs to get. He struck out the first batter he faced but the next four reached. With the score having narrowed to 10-7, Atlanta went to closer Raisel Iglesias to get the final two outs. Unfortunately, he allowed Arizona to take an 11-10 lead before getting out of the inning. Atlanta couldn’t score in the bottom of the ninth to stay alive. It was a heartbreaking loss in what has already been a rough stretch for the club. It was their fourth straight L and they are now 3-11 in their past 14 contests. Their overall record is 27-34, putting them behind all the other National League contenders in the standings. Blewett was charged with five earned runs in an inning and a third in today’s dagger. Blewett, 29, is out of options. That’s led him to bounce around the league. He started the season with the Twins on a minor league deal and was added to that club’s roster for a few days in April before getting designated for assignment. He was then claimed off waivers by the Orioles, though that club also designated him for assignment a few days later. That led him to Atlanta on a cash deal. He had a pretty decent run prior to today’s unpleasantness. Between those three clubs, he came into today with 24 innings and a 2.25 earned run average. His 22.8% strikeout rate and 8.9% walk rate were both around league average while his 58.5% ground ball rate was quite strong. The ERA climbed to 3.91 after today’s game but it’s been a solid season overall. But since he’s out of options and the club is looking to shake things up by adding Kimbrel, a 40-man roster spot was needed, so Blewett heads into DFA limbo. That can last as long as a week but the waiver process takes 48 hours, meaning Atlanta could take as long as five days to explore trade interest. Though he’s out of options, he’s still in his pre-arbitration seasons, meaning he’s cheap. As mentioned, he’s been having a good year, today’s results notwithstanding. As for Hernández, it’s unclear exactly what his injury is but he departed yesterday’s game and appeared to be in discomfort. More information should be revealed when he is officially placed on the injured list.', 'The Pittsburgh Steelers finally found their starting quarterback for the 2025 season on Thursday when it was announced that Aaron Rodgers would be signing with the team. It had been nearly three months of the two sides being in contact without a deal being done, so the fan base can breathe a sigh of relief now that Rodgers is officially coming to Pittsburgh. Some hate the move, while others are fine with it as they can acknowledge that the four-time league MVP was the best option for Pittsburgh if the organization had serious intentions on being competitive in 2025. Rodgers arguably provides Pittsburgh with its highest-ceiling, and there is a chance the organization can win a playoff game in 2025 with him under center. The best way to make it into the playoffs is by winning the AFC North, but Pittsburgh might have to settle for a Wild Card spot as the Baltimore Ravens seem to have a firm grasp on the division. Their head coach, John Harbaugh, spoke to the media on Friday, and he was asked about Pittsburgh acquiring Rodgers. He gave his thoughts on the matter. ""I didn\'t have reaction,"" Harbaugh said. ""Just respect, respect for the Steelers, obviously. Respect for the team that they have, the coaches they have, head coach, Coach Tomlin. I mean obviously we\'ve always respected Aaron Rodgers, I mean he\'s a Hall of Fame quarterback. So we\'ll have to go against a Hall of Fame quarterback with one of the premiere teams in the league. Who happens to be our arch-rival, so we\'ll be preparing for that."" Harbaugh was talking to a media scrum, so he wasn\'t going to say anything too candidly. He spoke about his admiration for Pittsburgh and Rodgers, but deep down, he knows that the veteran quarterback is on his last leg. He can still be a good quarterback, but he is nowhere near the player that he once was. He does however, give the Steelers their best chance to compete for the AFC North title. Pittsburgh has not won the AFC North since the 2020 season when the team started the year out 11-0. The group still had its signature late-season collapse as Pittsburgh finished the year 12-4 and lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns. If the group wants to get back to winning the division, Pittsburgh needs consistent offensive production. There were too many times during the 2024 season where the offense had no life, and hopefully Rodgers is able to keep that from happening. The arm talent is still there from Rodgers, which he showed as he continued to get better during the 2024 season. The quarterback tossed 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while returning from his Achilles injury, and his production should be better in 2025 as he will be two years removed from the injury. Steelers Will Have To Beat Ravens At Some Point With Aaron Rodgers At The Helm If Pittsburgh wants to meet its goals of at least winning one playoff game during the 2025 season, it is more than likely that the Steelers will have to take down the Ravens at least once. The two play twice during the regular season, while there is also a chance the two sides could meet up in the first round of the postseason as well. For a while, it felt like Pittsburgh had Baltimore\'s number, but after the 2024 season, that is no longer the case. The Ravens beat Pittsburgh when the two played in December, and Baltimore won again in the Wild Card Round. It is hard to imagine the Steelers can have much success with Rodgers. He is still a decent quarterback, but recent results in Pittsburgh to end the season are hard to ignore.', 'The New York Knicks are hoping to interview a Hall of Fame player for their head-coaching vacancy, but they would first need permission from another NBA team. The Knicks are expected to formally request permission to interview Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd, according to NBA reporter Marc Stein. Stein wrote on Friday that the Knicks have interest in Kidd, though it is unclear how the Mavericks will react to the inquiry. ESPN’s Tim McMahon, who covers the Mavericks, said on “The Hoop Collective” podcast earlier this week that there is a possibility of Kidd leaving Dallas to take the same job with the Knicks. McMahon cited Kidd’s strong relationship with Jalen Brunson, whom Kidd coached in Dallas, and other people in New York. While McMahon said it would be going “way too far” to say Kidd wants out of Dallas, the reporter claimed the Mavericks have made some recent decisions that Kidd was not pleased about. Kidd is close with veteran NBA trainer Casey Smith, who was controversially phased out by the Mavericks a while back. Smith has since taken a job with the Knicks. Kidd just completed his fourth season as the head coach in Dallas. He led the team to the NBA Finals a year ago, but things changed dramatically for the Mavericks after Luka Doncic was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a stunning move. Kidd suggested publicly that he had no say in the deal. The 52-year-old Kidd spent a brief period as a player with the Knicks during his Hall of Fame career in 2012-13.

He threw 33 touchdown passes and just seven interceptions.', 'In 2020, 43-year-old Tom Brady left New England for Tampa Bay. He threw 40 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions, leading the Bucs to an 11-5 record and a Super Bowl title.', ""Thing is, there have been fewer than 20 quarterbacks in NFL history to even start games after age 40.

Beyond Favre and Brady, who isn't in yet but will be, the only other 40-plus-year-old Hall of Famer with more than a handful of starts is Warren Moon (11-14 as a starter for Seattle and Kansas City)."", 'Moon was a very good player. But Favre, Brady and Aaron Rodgers are all considered better.', ""Rodgers, who agreed to terms with the Steelers Thursday night, threw 28 touchdown passes and just 11 interceptions for the Jets.

Always a quarterback who values the football – Rodgers has 503 touchdown passes against just 116 interceptions in his career – he's reached double digits in interceptions in a season just four times in his 20-year career."", ""And he'll value the football while producing touchdowns."", 'Ben Roethlisberger threw 33 touchdown passes in 2020, his first season back after undergoing elbow surgery in 2019.', 'Since that time, the Steelers have struggled to produce touchdown passes at anywhere near that level.', ""The Steelers also won't be asking Rodgers to be the Aaron Rodgers of five or 10 years ago. What they need from him is what Favre provided for the Vikings in 2009, when they came within a game of going to the Super Bowl, and what Brady gave to the Buccaneers."", ""In Brady's case, for example, he was replacing Jameis Winston, who had led the NFL with 30 interceptions the previous season."", 'Brady obviously gave Tampa Bay much more than that, but even if he had posted, say, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, they would have been a better football team.', ""They had a solid defense. They had playmakers on offense. They just couldn't live with their quarterback throwing the ball to the other team 30 times."", ""The Steelers also won't be asking Rodgers to be the focal point of their offense.

The Steelers are still going to rely heavily on the run."", ""Rodgers' former team, the Jets, ran the ball 363 times, dead last in the NFL. New York asked Rodgers to carry the team."", 'The Steelers, meanwhile, will be asking him to make a handful of big-time throws per game, not dozens.', 'He is most certainly capable of doing that.

But, perhaps more importantly, there have been massive changes to the lineup.', ""Of the 22 starters who opened the year last season in Atlanta, 10 are no longer with the team. Of the 22 players who started the team's playoff loss to the Ravens, eight are no longer with the team."", ""That's not simply doing the same thing with the same people and expecting different results. That's real, tangible change."", ""• The Steelers have their three practices next week at the mandatory minicamp. After that the coaching staff won't lay eyes on the players again until they report to Saint Vincent College for training camp on July 23."", ""Now that Rodgers is under contract, he's obligated to attend minicamp. Unlike the OTA sessions, which are voluntary, these are mandatory workouts for all players under contract."", 'Also, over the years, the Steelers have added some key pieces in the post-minicamp days.', 'In 2019, cornerback Joe Haden was signed at the end of training camp following his release by Cleveland.', 'In 2021, David DeCastro surprisingly retired on June 24, soon after the Steelers had finished minicamp. That led to the team signing guard Trai Turner a few days later as a replacement.', 'And in 2023, the Steelers signed linebacker Kwon Alexander on July 30, just a couple of days after reporting to Saint Vincent College.', 'Things happen. Rosters continue to evolve.', 'This one will continue to do so, as well.', ""• It's incredibly difficult to get playoff wins."", 'To drive that point home, Rodgers is 11-10 in his career in the postseason.

And yet, on paper and on the field, Rodgers doesn\'t appear to be a fit for the Steelers\' offense or its longstanding organizational philosophies, leaving the franchise hurtling toward an identity crisis.', 'Tomlin doubled down on the importance of being a run-first team when he hired offensive Arthur Smith a year ago, but on Friday the Steelers are expected to agree to a deal with Rodgers, who attempted the second-most passes in the NFL last season.', 'Tomlin also repeatedly emphasized mobility as a coveted quarterback trait, yet his new signal-caller took 40 sacks and rushed 34 times for 94 yards last season.', 'And general manager Omar Khan orchestrated a blockbuster trade to acquire premier deep threat DK Metcalf on the eve of free agency and signed him to an unprecedented extension, yet now has agreed to terms with a quarterback who averaged 6.6 air yards per attempt last season, ranking 32nd out of 36 qualified signal-callers.', ""• See all 257 picks | Pick-by-pick analysis\n• Kiper's grades | Miller's best 100 picks\n• Yates' favorite picks | Overreactions\n• Kiper's Day 1 winners | Day 2 winners\n• Sanders to Browns | Hunter to Jaguars"", '""The way we ended [the season] was unacceptable,"" Khan said at the NFL combine.

And while Rodgers, poised to be the team's fifth different Week 1 starting quarterback in as many years, is a change, it's not necessarily one in concert with their intended offensive identity."", ""Rodgers' acquisition marks the second time in as many years the Steelers have taken a swing on a reclamation project. Like 36-year-old Russell Wilson before him, Rodgers, 41, was released before the end of his contract by the New York Jets, who once gave up a king's ransom in hopes he would reinvigorate their franchise."", 'This is the hand the Steelers dealt themselves by not re-signing Justin Fields, their onetime quarterback who left for the Jets and a modest contract -- his $20 million average annual value is the lowest among all projected starting quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal -- and a fresh start.', ""The Steelers earned Rodgers' long-awaited final rose after the Giants signed Wilson and Minnesota committed to 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy as its starting quarterback. Pittsburgh then landed Rodgers after a tedious internal tug-of-war between Rodgers' desire to keep playing or to retire. At this point in his career, though, Rodgers comes with more thorns than petals."", ""As a four-time NFL MVP, 10-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champion -- in a win over Tomlin's Steelers -- Rodgers is an undeniable future Hall of Famer. But after two decades in the NFL and an Achilles rupture that cost him the 2023 season and a triumphant second act in New York, Rodgers enters Pittsburgh as a shadow of the quarterback who won back-to-back MVP awards in 2020 and 2021."", ""Since last earning the NFL's highest individual honor, Rodgers' performance has been in sharp decline. In 2022 and 2024, his past two seasons as a starter, he ranked 26th and 25th in QBR and 21st and 26th in yards per attempt."", ""Beyond being the ringmaster of New York's off-field circus for the better part of two seasons, Rodgers' on-field performance in his lone complete season as the starter declined from the gold standard set during his Green Bay career. Though Rodgers finished the season completing 63% of his attempts for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, he posted a 48.0 QBR. His career low QBR as a complete-season starter was 41.3 in 2022. That year, his final season in Green Bay, he completed 64.6% of attempts for 3,695 yards, 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as the Packers went 8-9."", ""Perhaps the lowest point in a reel of Rodgers' Jets-era lowlights came in a 40-14 Week 17 loss to the Buffalo Bills, when he recorded a career-worst 1.2 QBR, threw two interceptions and was sacked four times to surpass Tom Brady as the most-sacked quarterback in NFL history. By the time Rodgers benched himself with the Jets trailing 40-0 at the start of the fourth quarter, the offense had gone 14 straight possessions without a touchdown. The unit finally scored a touchdown -- Rodgers' 500th career TD strike -- in the second quarter of an eventual regular-season finale win against the Dolphins in Rodgers' last game as Jet."", ""The Steelers had similar offensive dry spells during 2024. They failed to score an opening-drive touchdown all season. From the start of the Week 11 win against the Baltimore Ravens (thanks to Chris Boswell's field goals) until Wilson found receiver Calvin Austin for a 23-yard score late in the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Browns a week later, the Steelers went 20 offensive possessions -- seven quarters -- without a touchdown."", '""It certainly needs to score more points,"" Tomlin said of the offense in his season-ending news conference. ""In whatever way that happens is whatever way that happens. It doesn\'t necessarily mean construction, but we certainly got to score more points. You\'re not going to score 14 points a week in January and be very successful.""', ""In a side-by-side comparison, Wilson's strengths would seem to fit better with the Steelers' offensive personnel."", ""Wilson averaged 7.6 yards per attempt in 2024, while Rodgers checked in at 6.7. Wilson also outperformed Rodgers when they weren't pressured, per ESPN Research. Wilson completed 75% of attempts with 11 touchdowns and two interceptions for a QBR of 71. Rodgers completed 68% of attempts when he wasn't pressured and threw 21 touchdowns to 10 interceptions for a QBR of 55.

Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here."", ""And although Rodgers wasn't shy about letting it fly earlier in his career, he has been noticeably more conservative since the Achilles tear. He averaged 2.69 seconds to throw, fifth among qualified quarterbacks, last season, and his 6.6-yard average throw distance was the fifth shortest in the league. 2024 marked the only full season as a starter that he averaged a throw distance below 7.4 yards."", ""Rodgers also hasn't been at the helm of prolific running offenses. The Jets ranked 28th in run plays last year, and from 2008 to 2022, the Packers ran on 37% of plays -- the fourth-lowest rate in the league over that span, according to ESPN Research. Rodgers' new offensive coordinator, Smith, however, has overseen top-five rushing offenses in five of his past six seasons as a playcaller."", ""But those are moot points, because while the Steelers waited for Rodgers' decision, Wilson took matters into his own hands and scheduled visits with the Browns and Giants. A day after news spread of Wilson's visits, the Steelers inked Rudolph, their 2018 third-round pick who spent the 2024 season in Tennessee, to a two-year, $8 million deal."", ""Some, like the Steelers, believe Rodgers has more upside than Wilson -- or any other option available in weak quarterback free agency and draft classes. The Jets had a better red zone scoring percentage than the Steelers in 2024 -- 54.55% to Pittsburgh's 48.21%, the fourth lowest in the NFL."", '""He played good, especially towards the end of the season,"" said Steelers cornerback Brandin Echols, who played with Rodgers in New York last season. ""I wish the outcome was a little better, but towards the end of the season he started to really wake up.""', ""The Steelers' approach to free agency put the ball in Rodgers' hands.

Whether they regard Rodgers as a barnstorming opportunist who is hoping to exit the NFL with a better final chapter or whether they resent his failure to pounce on the team’s interest in signing him (Cam Heyward’s words resonated in Steelers Nation) or whether they simply don’t like him, the anti-Aaron sentiment has been palpable.', 'Beyond the anecdotal evidence of fans complaining about Rodgers, we posted a couple of polls that posed a simple question.

Six Super Bowl wins. The NFL's longest-tenured head coach. Black and gold uniforms that have rarely been tweaked. They are what you might call one of the dignitaries of football history, established in the earliest days of the NFL and still graced with some of the league's premier matchups, like the NFL's first foray into Ireland this fall."", 'Unfortunately, legacy doesn\'t always equate to contemporary impact. ""Star Wars"" was a cultural phenomenon at the tail end of the 1970s, right around the same time the Steelers were the NFL\'s dynastic powerhouse. Today, ""Star Wars"" is an oversaturated made-for-streaming brand, and the Steelers are the NFL equivalent, living off residuals and banking on nostalgia without lasting results.', 'Is this an unreasonable critique of a franchise that last suffered a losing record in 2003, the year 50 Cent dropped ""In Da Club"" and George W. Bush was halfway through his first term? Does consistency warrant no respect anymore? Surely fans of downtrodden, dysfunctional teams like the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets would kill to have even half the Steelers\' annual success.', 'The problem is, the Steelers tout their higher bar -- ""The standard is the standard,"" coach Mike Tomlin often quips -- like it still applies to their operation. What is the standard? Winning titles? That hasn\'t occurred since 2008, when Ben Roethlisberger was 26 years old. Winning conference championships? That hasn\'t happened since 2010, when Aaron Rodgers was the trophy-wielding face of the Green Bay Packers, not the 41-year-old ""missing piece"" of the very Steelers team he conquered in Super Bowl XLV. Winning just a single playoff game? Nope. Not since 2016.', 'The Steelers deserve credit for staying relevant. But only in the sense that ""relevant"" means annually eligible for an ugly one-and-done postseason appearance. In the time since ""the standard"" last translated to a Pittsburgh playoff victory, the Kansas City Chiefs have drafted Patrick Mahomes and made five Super Bowls, the nearby Philadelphia Eagles have made three Super Bowls and won two (with two different sets of coaches and quarterbacks), and the rival Cincinnati Bengals have made two AFC title games. Only seven NFL teams have longer active playoff-win droughts.', 'Miami Dolphins', '24', 'Las Vegas Raiders', '22', 'New York Jets', '14', 'Chicago Bears', '14', 'Arizona Cardinals', '9', 'Carolina Panthers', '9', 'Denver Broncos', '9', ""But don't worry, Tomlin has never had a losing record! We should all fear that Steelers defense!"", ""Perhaps this is too harsh. Perhaps the Steelers really do deserve the benefit of the doubt. If you hang around long enough, after all, you're bound to get over the hump eventually. It's what defined Andy Reid's career, in a way, going from longtime would-be champion with the Eagles to repeat trophy-winner in Kansas City."", ""The difference is that Reid and his Chiefs, and even the Eagles that followed his Philly tenure, always adapted offensively (and had some elite quarterbacking to help). The Steelers, meanwhile, have been stumbling all over themselves in search of a dance partner since the final sluggish seasons of Roethlisberger's reign."", ""They closed their eyes and smashed the red button in 2022, spending a first-round draft pick on Kenny Pickett, only to saddle the young signal-caller with iffy staffing and support, then ship him out of town entirely once he soured on his hometown team a couple years later. They proactively pillaged the bargain bin with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, only to let both veterans walk after another aggressively mediocre January finish. And now they're entering summer 2025 -- Year 19 of the Tomlin regime -- with every chip pushed onto Rodgers, who waited until June to make a firm commitment to the organization."", 'It\'s not easy to go from one long-term quarterback answer to the next, a la the Packers with Brett Favre to Rodgers to Jordan Love. Sometimes -- oftentimes -- taking lumps is required. In this way, however, the Steelers\' ""standard"" of perpetual wild-card contention has actually worked against them. ', ""Like, say, the New Orleans Saints, who until this offseason refused for years to embrace a full rebuild, forever gazing at the past peaks of the Drew Brees-Sean Payton reign, the Steelers have avoided the potential fruits of a total teardown -- at quarterback, atop the staff, etc. -- by always prioritizing quick fixes. Is that smart, given Tomlin's ability to coax a winner out of any roster? Or is it delusional, given his inability to top true contenders down the stretch?"", '2022', 'Mitchell Trubisky', 'Free agency', '2-5', '2022', 'Kenny Pickett', 'Draft', '14-10', '2024', 'Russell Wilson', 'Free agency', '6-6', ""As we stand here in 2025, it's probably true that Rodgers was the Steelers' best remaining bet at quarterback. He's aging, but he can still sling the rock. He certainly offers a higher ceiling than Mason Rudolph, whose recent internal endorsements should ring a bit hollow considering Pittsburgh literally let the career backup leave town immediately following his brief 2023 takeover."", ""Just because Rodgers was the best arm available doesn't mean Pittsburgh is off the hook for reaching this point. The guy who left the Jets in ruin and barely stayed upright while doing so is your grand plan? That's at least a little concerning."", ""We could've said the same thing about the Jets of two years ago. When Rodgers was approaching 40, coming off a so-so finale with the Packers, was he an upgrade for New York? An understandable win-now gamble? Sure. But the primary reason Rodgers chose the Jets wasn't because New York was a shining beacon of potential Super Bowl glory, but because he knew his time was up in Green Bay and his market around the NFL was no longer incredibly robust. And the primary reason the Jets bet on Rodgers' impact -- not so much his upside, but his past results -- was because they were absolutely desperate for help."", ""Is anyone surprised, in retrospect, that the entire marriage proved both short-lived and akin to a reality-TV circus? No. Not really. That's what makes the Jets the Jets. But the real question is, are the present-day Steelers that far off? That's not to say the two are comparable in the NFL standings; Steelers fans can at least bank on sniffing the playoffs every fall, which is a lot more than can be said for Gang Green faithful. Failure to meet internal standards, however, is just part of what makes Pittsburgh such a curious franchise right now. There's also the team's evident appetite for -- or at least tolerance of -- sideshow drama."", ""Love or hate Rodgers, he is an outsized presence and increasingly public personality. He acts and sounds off as he pleases. Now, he's earned that platform as a future Hall of Famer. And he may well face too much scrutiny for it. But the fact he dominated the Steelers' news cycle for months, even before putting pen to paper to play for the team, is just par for the course in Pittsburgh these days. Far from the buttoned-up outfit they're often portrayed as, the Steelers might be one of the NFL's most riotous assemblies -- darn near attracted to tabloid fodder -- during their near-decade of playoff stagnation."", ""When Roethlisberger retired in 2022, the franchise great indicated certain factions of the front office wanted him back, arguing the alleged divide all but forced him to hang up the cleats. Before the ill-tempered George Pickens was traded out of the wide receiver room this offseason, there was Le'Veon Bell, Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, Chase Claypool, Diontae Johnson -- a whole cast of talented playmakers whose locker-room volatility bought them unceremonious exits."", ""These weren't bottom-of-the-roster malcontents. They were front-facing standouts who simply couldn't stick under the Steelers' standards. Or were they just products of that standard? Tomlin is a revered leader who often gets heralded for running a tight ship despite employing plenty of colorful characters. Are we sure his Steelers aren't just a wellspring of players destined to disrupt? Is Pittsburgh really good at maximizing troubled talents before cutting them loose, or does the team just have an unhealthy attachment to such projects? What about finding elite players stable enough to retain for the long term?"", ""There are exceptions, of course: T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Minkah Fitzpatrick. It just so happens most of those gems fall on the defensive side of the ball. It's the spots critical to modern-day success -- you know, quarterback, receiver, etc. -- that have either been fumbled or filled with short fuses in Western Pennsylvania."", ""Maybe, just maybe, the Steelers will finally right the ship with Rodgers at the helm. Maybe they have a longer-term solution up their sleeves. And maybe that something is an unspoken commitment to mining the 2026 quarterback class for a true savior. But even that should be considered something of a pipe dream. We're old enough to remember scouts suggesting teams desperate for quarterbacks wait for the 2023 class just for the mere possibility of landing ... Bryce Young. Literally every single quarterback class is barely even a 50-50 proposition in terms of who pans out and who doesn't. Are we to believe the Steelers front office that handpicked and quickly dumped Pickett is equipped to right that wrong next time around?"", 'Terry Bradshaw, the most accomplished Steelers quarterback of all-time, might\'ve been letting his emotions fly when he described the current club this offseason as a ""joke"" and ""failure"" for its pursuit of Rodgers. Yet it\'s hard not to consider his perspective when Pittsburgh\'s abundance of high-profile drama rarely supersedes its big-game production. Or when a pattern of actions that lends itself to being ""just good enough"" takes precedent over the necessary pains of an overhaul. Winning cures everything, they say, and the issue in Steel City hasn\'t necessarily been winning; it\'s been winning games that matter. Tomlin has done that before. The Steelers have done that before. No one can take that away from them.', 'Now it\'s time -- beyond time -- for them to make ""the standard"" mean something again.

"Steelers' long wait for Aaron Rodgers is over, but offense far from finished product",https://www.nfl.com/news/steelers-long-wait-for-aaron-rodgers-is-over-but-offense-far-from-finished-product,"['Senior National Columnist', 'For months, Aaron Rodgers had said all the right things to the Pittsburgh Steelers, if not to everyone else. He had asked about practice schedules. He had throwing sessions with new Steelers receiver DK Metcalf. He had been in communication with head coach Mike Tomlin. He had given the Steelers every reason to believe he would eventually be theirs, as long as he did not shift field and completely leave the game.', ""During that time, the Steelers could only wait, knowing they were Rodgers' only potential landing spot, but having no more significant insight into his timeline than anyone else. Notably, Pittsburgh waited until the sixth round in April's draft to select a quarterback, Will Howard, about as clear as sign as possible that the team was confident Rodgers would be its QB1."", 'On Thursday, their very patient approach finally paid off, when Rodgers told the team he would be in Pittsburgh for their minicamp next week. The drama of his courtship and his decision-making process gives way to a more immediate concern: What does he still have left and how much can the Steelers put around him?', 'The Steelers are a win-right-now team, with defensive veterans like T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward, who have seen Pittsburgh through the final years of the Ben Roethlisberger era and then the long wandering through the fallow field of franchise quarterback wannabes. The Steelers have made the playoffs in four of the past five seasons. But Kenny Pickett, Justin Fields and Russell Wilson all came and went, doing enough to keep the team above .500 and get into the last two postseasons, but nowhere near enough to win a playoff game.', 'For Rodgers to get the Steelers over the hump, he will have to be considerably more consistent than he was with the New York Jets last year, when he showed flashes of being able to lead drives with his arm and brain, if no longer with his legs. Rodgers was coming back from an Achilles tear he suffered in his first game with the Jets in 2023, and there is little doubt that the injury -- coupled with being 40 years old -- contributed to the absence of mobility. The problem is that quarterbacks -- or any professional athlete, for that matter -- do not get better as they get older and there were real moments when Rodgers looked like he was very near the end. The Jets were a flawed team -- in coaching, in personnel -- and Rodgers is further removed from the worst injury of his career and from other injuries that nagged him last season, but it is fair to wonder if Rodgers is still the kind of player who can elevate his teammates. Rodgers looked mostly fine when throwing to his old friend Davante Adams last season. But his connection with a young star like Garrett Wilson never fully materialized, to the detriment of Wilson, Rodgers and the Jets offense.', 'Still, Rodgers played better toward the end of the season -- perhaps because he was healthier -- and finished the season with 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while the team went 5–12 overall. It was not MVP-level Rodgers, but there was at least enough on tape to convince the Steelers that in an offseason offering few options -- it was considered a weak draft class at the position and their top choice in free agency, Fields, decided to sign with the Jets instead of staying in Pittsburgh -- Rodgers would give them the best chance to do what the Steelers are supposed to do: win playoff games.', ""To do that, it is up to the franchise to add more weapons for Rodgers after an offseason that has seen some big-name attrition. Running back Najee Harris is a Charger. George Pickens was traded to the Cowboys. Metcalf, by far the biggest offseason move before Rodgers, will be the No. 1 receiver and his downfield playmaking ability should match with Rodgers' accuracy and arm. The offensive line is going to be important here. Rodgers can still sling it when he has time. Too often with the Jets, though, he felt the pressure coming and resorted to short, over the middle dump-off passes to avoid taking hits. That's normal for an older quarterback who is not as mobile as he was as a younger player -- and it is potentially good news for slot receiver Calvin Austin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth -- but a porous offensive line and a skittish Rodgers would not be able to take full advantage of Metcalf's skills."", 'A meeting this week with free-agent Gabe Davis did not result in a contract and the Steelers likely have to keep looking for receiving targets. Pittsburgh drafted running back Kaleb Johnson, who is big with a good burst. The hope is he will add a spark and bigger running plays to a unit that struggled last season, and that offensive coordinator Arthur Smith will be able to lean into the running game he would like to execute. Without more personnel additions in the weeks before the team heads to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in late July for training camp, the Steelers will be counting very heavily on the defense and Tomlin to generate enough support for Rodgers.', ""For as much relief and anticipation as Rodgers' decision generates, it is still just a band-aid for the Steelers. Even if they win big with Rodgers, it has been years since they could be assured they had a long-term answer at quarterback. Perhaps they hit the jackpot with Howard, who now can watch Rodgers. Perhaps the Steelers will be looking for a quarterback next offseason."", ""Rodgers, who will turn 42 in December, is a bridge, something he hasn't been in his Hall of Fame-caliber career. His buy-in will be critical -- it was clear he grew frustrated in New York last season -- but so will the Steelers'. The roster needs more help to maximize whatever time the Steelers get with Rodgers. Without reinforcements, the long wait for this quarterback, while finally over, will still have been in vain."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 NFL Enterprises LLC.

Aaron Rodgers signing with Steelers: Four-time NFL MVP joining Pittsburgh on one-year deal,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-signing-with-steelers-four-time-nfl-mvp-joining-pittsburgh-on-one-year-deal/,"['', ""After weeks of waiting and mulling his different options, Aaron Rodgers has chosen his new NFL team. The four-time NFL MVP agreed to terms with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the team announced Thursday night. Rodgers will attend Pittsburgh's mandatory minicamp next week. "", 'The Steelers were one of three teams viewed as being in the running for Rodgers. The New York Giants were another, but instead opted to sign Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson. The Minnesota Vikings were also a team to watch; the sides had had conversations before the Vikings ultimately decided to go ahead with J.J. McCarthy, a 2024 first-round pick who was injured his entire rookie season. ', 'The Steelers made it clear at the NFL Scouting Combine that they wanted to re-sign either Wilson or Justin Fields at quarterback before the start of free agency, but failed on both counts. Now, Pittsburgh has committed to going the veteran quarterback route for another year while bringing back Mason Rudolph and drafting Ohio State QB Will Howard in the seventh round.', 'Rodgers, who spent the past two years with the New York Jets, is coming off the worst season of his Hall-of-Fame career. He registered career-worsts in games lost (12), yards per attempt (6.7) and passer rating (90.5). In 2024, Rodgers threw for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and became the fifth quarterback in NFL history to reach 500 career touchdown passes.', 'While the Steelers can now feel more comfortable having grabbed a seat in this stressful game of quarterback musical chairs, the decision to sign Rodgers will be a polarizing one in Pittsburgh. After all, Rodgers has more losing seasons (three) than playoff wins (two) since 2017. In fact, earlier this offseason Steelers safety DeShon Elliott even commented on a social media post pointing to the fact that the Steelers became the betting favorites to land Rodgers, saying, ""Leave his ass at the retirement home.""', 'The Steelers are attempting to revamp an offense that was much too inconsistent in 2024. Pittsburgh swung a trade for former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf and gave him a five-year, $150 million contract last month, and now, has found its new quarterback. ', 'If Rodgers could win one more Super Bowl, he would join Manning and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks ever to win at least three league MVPs and two Super Bowls. That would certainly cement his place as a top-five quarterback in NFL history. ', ""That's the reward aspect of Rodgers giving it one more go with the Steelers in 2025 along with how celebrated he would be for lifting one of the league's most historic franchises back to the mountain top for Pittsburgh's first championship since the 2008 season. Doing so would also allow Rodgers to ride off into the sunset with many people forgetting some of his behavior regarding his public health stances and the worst season of his career helping lead to the firings of New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas in 2024. "", 'However, giving it another go in 2025 as he turns 42 is also a big risk. Rodgers will be two years removed from tearing his Achilles, and last season he looked incredibly stiff moving around the pocket following an injury that has drained much of the mobility that allowed him to dance around in the pocket before making jaw-dropping throw after jaw-dropping throw throughout his career. Another serious injury, missing the postseason, plenty of pain and even a potential, permanent limp could be the end result of another year of NFL football for Rodgers at his age. -- Garrett Podell', ""While talent was clearly a reason why the Steelers fell apart late last season, you could argue that a lack of offensive leadership also contributed to the collapse. While Rodgers' public persona is a complicated, he has largely been regarded in the past as a great teammate and a leader who isn't afraid to challenge anyone. The Steelers haven't had an offensive leader like that since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. What Rodgers should bring to Pittsburgh from a leadership standpoint shouldn't be overlooked. "", ""While they don't have a ton of depth behind them, the Steelers' offensive line has the potential to be the franchise's best since 2020. The starting-five projects to include two former first-round picks in tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu, a returning Pro Bowler in veteran guard Isaac Seumalo, and two second-years players in center Zach Frazier and Mason McCormick who were immediate starters in 2024. "", ""Rodgers has weapons at his disposal in DK Metcalf, fellow wideout Calvin Austin III and tight end Pat Freiermuth. He's already started working with Metcalf, and he should quickly gel with Austin, whose work ethic is among the best on the team. The Steelers are also reportedly trying to acquire another proven wideout after trading George Pickens to the Cowboys last month. There have been rumblings that Roman Wilson -- who missed his entire rookie season with an injury -- has impressed during OTAs. "", ""Pittsburgh still has Jaylen Warren, but it lost a big part of its offense when it let fellow running back Najee Harris test free agency (he ultimately signed with the Chargers). With Harris gone, the Steelers spent a third round pick on his replacement, former Iowa running back Kaleb Johnson. The 6-foot-1, 225-pound Johnson has already been compared to both Harris and Le'Veon Bell. Along with possessing Harris-like physicality, Johnson's patience and big-play ability are similar to Bell, who set several franchise records during his five-year run in Pittsburgh. "", ""Defensively, Rodgers will be complemented by a unit that is capable of winning some games on its own, especially after adding some necessary pieces via free agency and during the draft. The Steelers' defensive additions this offseason includes six-time Pro Bowl cornerback Darius Slay and first-round pick Derrick Harmon, one of the top-ranked defensive tackle prospects in this year's draft. -- Bryan DeArdo"", ""The fun gets started in Week 1 at New York in a game CBS will broadcast. The Jets had a chance to bring Rodgers back for a third season in New York, but they decided to move on. During an interview with Pat McAfee in April, Rodgers definitely sounded bitter about the way things ended. The 41-year-old said he flew across the country on his own dime only to sit down for a meeting where he was told in the first 20 seconds that the Jets didn't want him. "", ""The game between the Steelers and Jets is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET in Week 1, which is something that definitely would NOT have happened if the NFL had known for sure that Rodgers was going to sign. In a recent interview with CBS Sports, Mike North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning and scheduling, admitted that the game likely would have been given a prime-time slot if the league had been 100% certain that Rodgers was going to play. "", '""I think if the league knew, we probably would\'ve scheduled that game for a national television window,"" North said. ""Look at what we did with Aaron Rogers\' first game the last two years (both Monday night games). If we knew something, I think you would\'ve seen it reflected in the schedule. That being said, still a good game.""', 'The Week 8 Sunday night game that will see Pittsburgh host Green Bay is likely to be bittersweet for Rordgers, who of course started his career in Green Bay after the Packers selected him in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. By 2008, he was the full-time starter and during his 15 years under center, he led the Packers to five NFC title games and one Super Bowl win while also winning four MVP awards. Rodgers had a Hall of Fame career in Green Bay, but it came to a somewhat bitter end in April 2023 when the Packers traded him to New York.  ', ""The Packers made it pretty clear that they were getting ready to move on from Rodgers when they used a first-round pick in 2020 to select Jordan Love. Rodgers wasn't happy about the pick and things became awkward between him and the front office after that. Rodgers will now get to face Love for the first time. -- John Breech"", ""If Rodgers can beat Green Bay, he'd be just the fifth quarterback to beat all 32 teams as a starter, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees Peyton Manning, Brett Favre. Only two other active quarterbacks -- Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes -- have beaten 31 teams. Neither is set to reach 32 this season, as Wilson's Giants do not play the Seahawks, and Mahomes remains on the Chiefs. Two quarterbacks -- Joe Montana and Fran Tarkenton -- beat all 28 teams when the NFL had only 28 teams. -- Zachary Pereles"", 'Metcalf, who was traded from the Seahawks and promptly signed a five-year, $150 million extension, projects as the type of No. 1 receiver Rodgers has thrived with. A supercharged athlete with speed to burn, Metcalf should feature heavily in this offense on in-breaking routes, too.', 'Moreover, the Steelers showed a willingness to match Metcalf, 27, with a quarterback who has worked with big-bodied, physically gifted perimeter receivers his entire career. Metcalf has little competition for targets in a relatively scarce wide receiver room, and he should put up a monster season. Even amid a rough 2024 for the Jets, Garrett Wilson had over 100 catches, and Davante Adams averaged over six catches for over 77 yards per game in New York. -- Zachary Pereles', 'The Steelers were reportedly monitoring the Kirk Cousins situation in Atlanta as recently as late May. Cousins has not been at OTAs and has asked for a trade, though a deal was always going to have to wait until post-June 1 money savings kicked in.', ""Now, there's no clear spot for Cousins to land as a starter. The Browns have four quarterbacks. The Giants brought in two free agents and drafted Jaxson Dart in the first round. The Steelers have found their answer. Cousins has wanted out for months, but it will be hard for him to find a good landing spot and perhaps even harder for the Falcons to find a willing trade partner. -- Zachary Pereles"", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The most obvious of those chances begins in Week 1 when Rodgers will face the team that released him, the New York Jets.', 'The Jets have former Steelers quarterback Justin Fields, giving that game a dueling revenge game storyline. In addition, Rodgers gets to face his entire gauntlet of NFC North rivals, from the Minnesota Vikings in Ireland to the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions on the road. Both of those games should be marquee matchups.', 'Lastly, he will face the Green Bay Packers for the first time since leaving his longtime team during the 2023 offseason.

"Winners, losers from Aaron Rodgers joining Steelers: DK Metcalf gets boost, Steelers still bad?",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/winners-losers-from-aaron-rodgers-joining-steelers-dk-metcalf-gets-boost-steelers-still-bad/,"['', 'After months of speculation, Aaron Rodgers agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers and will report for minicamp next week. While the team was never truly worried about missing out on Rodgers according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones, it certainly took time, patience and a willingness to deal with at least a little bit of uncertainty.', 'Rodgers, 41, is coming off a disappointing two-year tenure with the Jets in which he tore his Achilles in Week 1 of 2023 and then struggled for much of 2024. After winning nearly two-thirds of his starts with the Steelers, Rodgers posted just a 6-12 record with New York, and he posted his lowest yards per attempt (6.7) as a starter last season while taking 40 sacks, his most since 2018.', 'Still, he is a four-time MVP, someone who, even far from his peak powers, slots in as the best quarterback the Steelers have had since Ben Roethlisberger\'s retirement. Even amid a lost 2024 season, he showed flashes of ""vintage Rodgers"" later in the year, highlighted by a four-touchdown performance in Week 18 against the Dolphins.', ""Rodgers' plan to sign has ripple effects across the Steelers and the league as a whole, both now and in the future. Here are winners and losers from the move:"", 'The Steelers, frankly, were desperate for Rodgers to sign. Yes, there were talks of contingency plans, but the Steelers had been after Rodgers for months, with every media appearance or every report on his plans holding major sway for an organization that has long prided itself on stability.', 'Pittsburgh moved on from both of its 2024 quarterbacks -- Russell Wilson and Justin Fields -- and had three quarterbacks on its roster: career backups Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson and sixth-round rookie Will Howard. That would have inarguably classified Pittsburgh as one of the worst quarterback rooms, if not the worst quarterback room, in the NFL.', ""Rodgers is no longer a premier quarterback, but he is a clear upgrade over what Pittsburgh had before Thursday and perhaps even above Wilson. Though both quarterbacks had similar success rates and expected points added per dropback in 2024, Rodgers avoids negative plays at a much higher rate -- Wilson had an 11.1% negative play rate last year compared to Rodgers' 8.8% -- and is much more willing to play on schedule and throw over the middle, vital parts of Arthur Smith's offense."", ""Rodgers is another year removed from a significant injury. He's entering a system that should, fundamentally, be more sound than the Jets' underwhelming, scattershot system, run first by Rodgers' old pal Nathaniel Hackett and then, after the Robert Saleh firing, by Todd Downing. The biggest difference between the Jets and the Steelers is stability. The Jets haven't had it for a decade-plus. The Steelers have. That should be good for Rodgers."", ""If the Steelers being both a winner and a loser from this signing doesn't summarize the Rodgers experience, nothing will. Rodgers, the player, is in clear decline. Beyond the stats, he graded out as Pro Football Focus' No. 18 quarterback last season, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize Wilson was 15th. A big issue for Wilson was his all-or-nothing approach that relied heavily on the deep ball. As a result, he finished 28th in success rate. That was still one spot better than Rodgers."", ""Beyond Rodgers the player is a significant injury history -- he limped through parts of 2024 -- and his sometimes-frustrating personality. The Jets appeased Rodgers with former coaches and teammates. He didn't deliver. He took a long time to decide his future and now faces an abbreviated offseason learning a new system. He is at the very least a big personality. He will have to fit into Mike Tomlin's well-established culture. That's not saying it can't be done. But there are questions -- and potentially headaches -- ahead."", 'One of the earliest signs pointing Rodgers to Pittsburgh was an informal throwing session with DK Metcalf in late March. Metcalf, who was traded from the Seahawks and promptly signed a five-year, $150 million extension, projects as the type of No. 1 receiver Rodgers has thrived with. A supercharged athlete with speed to burn, Metcalf should feature heavily in this offense on in-breaking routes, too.', 'Moreover, the Steelers showed a willingness to match Metcalf, 27, with a quarterback who has worked with big-bodied, physically gifted perimeter receivers his entire career. Metcalf has little competition for targets in a relatively scarce wide receiver room, and he should put up a monster season. Even amid a rough 2024 for the Jets, Garrett Wilson had over 100 catches, and Davante Adams averaged over six catches for over 77 yards per game in New York.', 'If there were ever a time to get off the high-floor, low-ceiling path the Steelers have been on since Roethlisberger retired, it was now. Instead, they likely face a similar outcome to what they have done every year since 2017: Go .500 or better and fail to win a playoff game.', ""Rodgers will be the Steelers' sixth different starting quarterback since 2022, the first year after Roethlisberger's retirement. Only one was drafted by the team: 2022 first-rounder Kenny Pickett, who never worked out. Pittsburgh never devoted resources to finding a Roethlisberger succession plan when he was in Pittsburgh and swung and missed on their only true attempt after he left."", ""Unless Rodgers really raises the ceiling, the Steelers will go another season without a true plan for the future of the position. Maybe he proves this inconsequential with a terrific year, but based on the past three seasons, that doesn't appear to be the case."", ""This isn't a perfect landing spot for Rodgers, but it is pretty good. The Steelers have famously never had a losing season under Tomlin. While that fact might be tiring, it's a testament to remarkable consistency in a league where most teams rise and fall. Rodgers should be backed by a strong defense and protected by a young offensive line that should only improve. Center Zach Frazier had a solid rookie season, and 2024 first-rounder Troy Fautanu returns from injury that limited him to one game last year. Left tackle Broderick Jones, a 2023 first-round selection, enters year three and is a key factor."", ""As a bonus, Rodgers faces the Jets in Week 1 and the Green Bay Packers (on Sunday Night Football, no less) in Week 8. The revenge tour begins. If he can beat Green Bay, he'd have beaten every team in the NFL over his illustrious career"", ""Rudolph and Howard did everything they were asked to do. Rudolph handled the Rodgers noise with aplomb. Howard, fresh off a national championship, figured to have a chance to be Rudolph's primary backup at worst. Now, both are relegated to the bench. Perhaps this matters, in the grand scheme of things, a little bit less for Rudolph, but Howard being relegated to third-string duty means fewer practice reps, which is a tough pill to swallow for him."", 'Rodgers is many things. ""Boring"" isn\'t one of them. For a franchise that\'s generally been very buttoned-up and straightforward dealing with the media, Rodgers is a major departure. Expect some fireworks.', 'The Steelers were reportedly monitoring the Kirk Cousins situation in Atlanta as recently as late May. Cousins has not been at OTAs and has asked for a trade, though a deal was always going to have to wait until post-June 1 money savings kicked in.', ""Now, there's no clear spot for Cousins to land as a starter. The Browns have four quarterbacks. The Giants brought in two free agents and drafted Jaxson Dart in the first round. The Steelers have found their answer. Cousins has wanted out for months, but it will be hard for him to find a good landing spot and perhaps even harder for the Falcons to find a willing trade partner."", ""If the Ravens, Bengals and Browns thought this might finally be the year the Steelers reset, they have to think again. We've run through the pros and cons of the Rodgers signing for Pittsburgh, but it's clear this team hopes to compete in the rugged AFC North. Rodgers is 3-0 in his career against the Browns, 3-1 against the Ravens and 2-2 against the Bengals."", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Pittsburgh coincidentally did little in the draft to make the marriage less likely, waiting until Day 3 to select a quarterback (Will Howard; No. 185 overall).', ""That left the Steelers staring at a QB room composed of Howard, Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, with one of the NFL's most obvious needs for a difference-making signal-caller."", 'Especially following the signing of Russell Wilson by the New York Giants -- another Rodgers suitor -- and several teams finding QBs through the draft, Pittsburgh inking the 41-year-old became the expected result for both parties, barring a Rodgers retirement.', 'Rodgers is coming off a season that dinged his reputation as a top-tier quarterback, as he struggled to make the difference so many expected for the New York Jets during a 5-12 campaign that included his head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas being fired midseason.', 'But Pittsburgh is nonetheless happy to land a future Pro Football Hall of Famer with 62,952 passing yards and 503 touchdowns under his belt. Adding another level of intrigue to the signing is that the Steelers play at the Jets to open the regular season on Sept. 7 and also host the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 26 on Sunday Night Football.', ""Rodgers' perceived downswing during the 2024 season at least partly stems from just how prolific he's been in stacking stats throughout his 20-year NFL career."", ""He wasn't as deadly accurate for New York as he's been, nor was he as nimble coming off a torn Achilles, but he still completed 63% of his passes for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2024. His numbers look even better when considering his final 10 games last season: 2,234 yards, 18 TDs and four INTs with a 64 completion percentage."", 'Rodgers, essentially swapping places with Justin Fields after the mobile QB agreed to go from the Black and Gold to Gang Green, will be working with a pass-catching group somewhat in flux.', ""The Steelers traded for Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf, who through six seasons has never fallen under 900 receiving yards and three times eclipsed 1,000. Pittsburgh also returns the team's leading pass catcher from 2024, tight end Pat Freiermuth. Beyond that, though, the receiving corps is relatively thin following the trade of George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. Calvin Austin III, veteran free-agent addition Robert Woods and 2024 third-rounder Roman Wilson will likely vie for the No. 2 WR role, assuming there's not be another spring FA add like Rodgers."", 'Pittsburgh nonetheless remains an ideal location for Rodgers to find redemption after the New York debacle. The Steelers consistently field a stellar defense and know how to accumulate wins, as evidenced by their last sub-.500 season taking place a couple years before Rodgers entered the league two full decades ago.', 'It will be intriguing to watch the relationship between Rodgers and head coach Mike Tomlin -- a player seemingly never shy to enact his influence and a head coach who commands the room -- but combining a championship quarterback with a championship coach is never a bad recipe to try.', 'Fourteen years ago, Rodgers took down Tomlin and the Steelers to win a Super Bowl.', 'He now joins them after a long and winding road in hopes of capturing a second.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 NFL Enterprises LLC.

See our ethics statement.', 'Mercifully, the months-long will-he-won’t-he game is over. Aaron Rodgers is officially the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers - but now what? What is the ceiling of this team? How far can they go? And what will Rodgers look like in his 21st year in the NFL? There are plenty of questions that still remain, even with Rodgers answering the biggest one. One thing seems pretty evident, though, and it’s that the Steelers are banking on the fact that Rodgers still has it and that he can prove a lot of people wrong - much like his former predecessor Brett Favre did in 2009.', 'Like Favre, Rodgers went to the New York Jets after a long career with the Green Bay Packers, and both stints didn’t exactly go as planned. Favre looked poised to lead New York to a playoff berth after an 8-3 start, but the Jets lost four of their final five games and missed the playoffs. Favre threw 22 touchdowns and 22 interceptions that season, and it looked as if that would be an unceremonious sunset season for the three-time MVP. However, in 2009, he joined the Minnesota Vikings and looked like a completely different player.', 'That season, Favre recaptured some of his former glory at age 40, throwing 33 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, which was the lowest total in a full season for his career. He also topped 4,200 yards passing for the first time since 1998 en route to leading the Vikings to an improbable appearance in the NFC Championship Game. And if not for a patented awful Favre interception late in the fourth quarter, the Vikings likely would have won and gone on to face Peyton Manning and the Colts in the Super Bowl.', 'I say all that to say this - Rodgers showed he still has some gas in the tank in 2024. Despite the Jets being a tire fire, Rodgers had 28 touchdown passes, which ranked sixth in the NFL. He averaged more yards per game than Justin Herbert, Jordan Love, Kyler Murray, C.J. Stroud, and Josh Allen, and his 90.5 passer rating was hovering around the league average of 92.3.', 'Rodgers’ arm talent was still very evident in 2024, as well. He finished seventh in the NFL in big-time throws with 26, and also didn’t put the ball in harm’s way, finishing with the third-lowest turnover-worthy play percentage of all quarterbacks with at least 150 dropbacks in 2024, per PFF.', 'To continue, Rodgers had one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL last season, which is practically kryptonite for an older signal-caller. Of the 44 quarterbacks with 150 dropbacks, he finished 33rd in average time to throw. Rodgers also didn’t get any help from the run game, as the Jets finished with the second-fewest rushing yards per game in the NFL. To compare, Justin Fields had the third-longest time to throw, while Russell Wilson finished in the upper half, as well, at 16th. The Steelers also had the 11th most rushing yards per game in 2024. Plug Aaron Rodgers into that offense last season, and it isn’t crazy to say they’d win at least one more game, which could have changed the outlook of their postseason fortunes, as well.', 'This isn’t to say that Rodgers is still the guy who was tossing 48 touchdowns to five interceptions back in 2020 - he isn’t. But he also hasn’t fallen off a cliff like some would suggest. Now in a more stable organization with a good head coach, a good No. 1 recevier, a solid offensive line and running back duo, as well as a strong defense on the other side of him, there’s no reason to believe Rodgers can’t have his own renaissance year like Favre did 16 years ago and help the Steelers end this playoff-win drought.', '', 'Gambling Problem?

But Rodgers had given mixed signals about whether he wants to continue his career.', '“I’m in a different phase of my life,” Rodgers said in April. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing. And I don’t think it’s fair to the Steelers or anyone while I’m dealing with a lot off the field.”', 'Whatever those issues were appear to have been resolved, but the Steelers will not get the version of Rodgers who once cut a swathe through the NFL in his prime with the Green Bay Packers, winning four league MVP awards and a Super Bowl along the way. Rodgers’s tenure with the Jets was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.', 'Rodgers’s hesitation over signing a contract had irritated many around the Steelers, including Terry Bradshaw, who led the team to four Super Bowl titles during his playing career.', '“That’s a joke.

Bring him in for one year, are you kidding me?”', 'Without Rodgers, the Steelers would probably have started Mason Rudolph, who recently rejoined the team from the Tennessee Titans.

Have they gotten better in the quarterback room? Absolutely,” Clark continued. “Will they contend for that championship that Pittsburgh Steelers people and fans and organization think is the standard? No, they won’t. They will be fighting for a wild card spot. They’ll probably be home Week 1 of the playoffs and again be looking for a franchise quarterback.”', 'Had the Steelers not signed Rodgers and went with a more inexperienced quarterback, they likely would have finished with a poorer record and garnered a higher pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Now, Clark feels the team may be in the exact same position next year.', 'While Clark is hardly alone in his criticism of the aging quarterback, the former safety has made it clear in the past that he is not Rodgers’ biggest fan. After Rodgers criticized how the media covers the NFL in December 2024, Clark fired back by calling him a “fraud.”', '“This dude is once again tone-deaf,” Clark said at the time. “This dude is once again unaware. This dude is once again arrogant to a point that’s almost sickening because he says these things, and he talks tough, and he behaves in his way, but he ain’t.”', '“This dude is a fraud,” he added. “He’s been a fraud. He can throw a football and that’s where it stops. Once that talent ends … so does he. And to sit up there, man, and to be just blatantly hypocritical is funny and sickening at the same time.”', 'In April, Clark criticized the Steelers for what he claimed was letting Rodgers essentially hold the franchise hostage by taking too much time to choose his next destination.', '“What has Aaron Rodgers done in the last two years or since leaving Green Bay that says he should be afforded this type of time that says that you should give them a sort of respect that keeps your franchise at bay?” Clark asked.', 'Rodgers’ deal with Pittsburgh is for one year and worth a base salary of around $10 million with incentives, according to NFL insider Ian Rappaport.', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', '', '', 'US WEEKLY HAS AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIPS SO WE MAY RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR SOME LINKS TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.', '', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly', 'Us Weekly is part of Part of the a360media Entertainment Group. © a360media 2025\nPowered by WordPress VIP', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXlXVVpaTldNME9GTmZVbmh5VFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

NFL free agency grades: QB Aaron Rodgers signs with Steelers,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44442475/2025-nfl-free-agency-grades-quarterback-aaron-rodgers-pittsburgh-steelers-signing,"['', 'Aaron Rodgers officially has a new team. The veteran quarterback agreed to terms on a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday and is expected to join the team for mandatory minicamp next week. Rodgers was released by the New York Jets in mid-March but took some time to weigh options before ultimately landing in Pittsburgh.', ""Rodgers, who will turn 42 during the 2025 season, is expected to start for the Steelers. He threw for 3,897 yards, 29 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions last season, his first full year with the Jets after tearing an Achilles in Week 1 in 2023. He was one of the top available QBs this offseason, and he is a four-time league MVP. But there are questions about how much he has left in the tank. Is this really a good move for Pittsburgh, even without other obvious solutions? Does it help stabilize the offense? Let's size up the deal."", ""Analytics writer Seth Walder is evaluating and grading the deal based on multiple factors, including on-field impact, salary cap implications, compensation, player value/age and the context of the Steelers' short- and long-term outlooks. How large is the impact of this decision, and how sure are we it's a good or bad choice? How does this affect Pittsburgh's chance to win the Super Bowl this season or in the future? We also asked NFL analyst Ben Solak to make sense of the scheme fit in the Steelers' offense -- is Pittsburgh's offense better now than it was in 2024?"", ""Here's our take on the long-awaited Rodgers deal."", '', 'Jump to:\nGrading the Rodgers deal\nSizing up the team fit', ""I can't believe we're back here, watching another NFL franchise desperate for an answer at quarterback kowtow to a 41-year-old who hasn't played good ball since 2021. Twelve months from now we will look up and most likely be talking about the Steelers' lost season with Rodgers that ended in disappointment. But ... I also think this is the rational choice for the Steelers. The median outcome is not the point. This move makes some sense simply because of the slim amount of upside that Rodgers still possesses and the options that were on the table."", 'In 2021, Rodgers recorded a 74.1 QBR, leading the league in the category and winning MVP. For context, the last time Russell Wilson -- who signed with the Giants but was theoretically an option to return to the Steelers at one point -- hit that QBR mark was in 2012, his rookie season. Same goes for Kirk Cousins, who might have been a trade candidate. As poorly as Rodgers played last season, the chances of him being a top-10 quarterback this season are higher than those of Wilson, Cousins or any other veteran who was or is available.', 'Rodgers is coming off a very poor 2024 season with the Jets in which he ranked 25th in QBR (48.0) despite having Garrett Wilson and Davante Adams (for 11 games) to target. His completion percentage over expectation was minus-5%, per NFL Next Gen Stats, better than those of only Anthony Richardson and Cooper Rush. (Granted, the pass protection in New York was below average.)', ""The optimistic case for the Steelers is that Rodgers was still hampered by the torn Achilles that knocked him out for all but four plays in the 2023 season. And to be fair, Rodgers did look more mobile as the 2024 season went along. Of Rodgers' 30 fastest top-speed plays last season, 17 came in Week 13 or later, per NFL Next Gen Stats. But an underrated part of the Rodgers career arc is that he played poorly not only last season after missing virtually all of 2023 but also in 2022, his final season with the Packers. Rodgers ranked 26th in QBR that year (one spot ahead of Wilson). So Rodgers' recent struggles shouldn't be attributed entirely to that injury; the decline started before he joined the Jets."", ""The Steelers would probably be wise to not let Rodgers have as much say in the offense as he had with the Jets. After all, Rodgers' best season in recent history was 2020 playing under Matt LaFleur in a system that used play-action and motion at much higher relative rates than what the Jets ran last season. Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith ran play-action 27% of the time last season (10th most) but was light on motion at the snap at just 16% (28th)."", ""The Jets' offense was also heavily predicated on receivers running straight. In fact, 27% of the Jets' routes were deep fades, short fades, hitches and go routes. That probably isn't ideal in general and definitely isn't ideal for a team whose best receiver is Garrett Wilson, who excels at moving laterally. However, that route profile is a strength of DK Metcalf."", ""What separates the Steelers from, say, the Giants (another reported contender for Rodgers at one point) is that Pittsburgh has the infrastructure that could possibly take advantage of Rodgers' upside. By that I mean this is a team that has:"", 'A potentially great defense. Pittsburgh ranked 10th in EPA per play last season, but its ceiling is so much higher. With T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith, Cameron Heyward and Nick Herbig (do not sleep on Nick Herbig!), the Steelers have an outrageous pass rush. And the secondary (with Minkah Fitzpatrick, Joey Porter Jr. and Darius Slay Jr.) can be solid, too.', 'Good enough pass protection. The Steelers ranked 13th in pass block win rate last season, though they lost left tackle Dan Moore Jr. to the Titans in free agency.', 'A good wide receiver in Metcalf. Though with George Pickens traded to the Dallas Cowboys, Rodgers and the Steelers really could use a second wide receiver behind the former Seahawks star. The depth chart behind Metcalf in not particularly inspiring.', ""A savvy coach with organizational power and a track record of being able to handle difficult personalities. This was something the Jets lacked, giving Rodgers de facto run of the organization. It's pretty clear that's not something a team should want, and if anyone can handle Rodgers, it's Mike Tomlin."", ""Assuming Rodgers is playing for something like the $10 million he said he would play for, this is a good move for Pittsburgh. Sure, there were low-cost QB alternatives at the draft. Shedeur Sanders fell to Day 3, but Pittsburgh passed on him at No. 83 and then again at No. 123. Even so, as poorly as Rodgers has played over the past few years, this is a relative bargain. The Steelers will likely be looking for a quarterback next offseason, but at least they didn't overspend in the interim. (They did draft Will Howard in the sixth round, but he is likely a backup in the pros.)"", ""• Offseason dates | OTAs and minicamps\n• 10 lingering questions | 2025 schedules\n• Draft pick analysis | Kiper's draft grades\n• Free agency grades | Top remaining FAs\nDraft | Free agency | Coaching hires"", ""Looking ahead, if Rodgers hits his, say, 85th percentile outcome, then the Steelers could go on a deep playoff run. If Wilson had landed in Pittsburgh and hit his own 85th percentile outcome, I don't think we could say the same thing. And if Rodgers were to hit his 85th percentile outcome with the Giants, they would still be a lacking football team. This is why the Rodgers-Steelers marriage makes uncomfortable sense."", ""Don't get me wrong: If I were the Steelers, I would not feel good about going down this path. But I also look at 30-year-old Watt and think that if they're going to take a swing while he's still there, there isn't a better alternative. -- Walder"", '', ""Riddling out whether Rodgers fits any sort of scheme or system starts not with his on-field talent but with whether he buys in. Will Rodgers willingly run the Arthur Smith offense when his time with the Jets was defined by his unwillingness to play in a new system or throw to new players? Smith's offenses in Tennessee, Atlanta and Pittsburgh have all relied heavily on play-action passes from under center, but Rodgers doesn't like turning his back to the defense. Is he finally ready to admit that his mobility is diminishing and bend his play style to accommodate it? Or will he continue to hold the line on how he wants to play?"", ""Rodgers is also an uncertain fit with Metcalf. The ex-Seahawk is one of the less precise route runners in the NFL, and Rodgers famously demands perfection from his receivers as they run his hand-selected variety of highly specific routes. It's hard to imagine a 17-game season in which there is no sideline or postgame blowup between Rodgers and his top pass catcher."", ""Even if the fit isn't perfect and the personalities clash, Rodgers was a better quarterback in the 2024 season than Russell Wilson or Justin Fields. The Steelers' offense under Rodgers will not consistently outperform last season's version, but it will likely have more peak games of competency, which could be a big deal come playoff time. -- Solak"", '', '', '']",Sports,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNXlXVVpaTldNME9GTmZVbmh5VFJDb0FSaXNBaWdCTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
