A South African immigrant who posted cringe, dreamed of microchipped brains, and didn’t understand the importance of halting mass immigration was going to become irrelevant.', '', '“Trump is a hero, and Elon Musk is not,” former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said on the Thursday episode of his War Room podcast. Musk’s eight-figure support for Trump in 2024 was “deal baggage,” and the deal had been completed months ago.', '', '“Elon Musk is illegal, and he’s gotta go, too,” Bannon said. “Deport immediately.”', '', 'Bannon told Semafor late last year that Musk “wrote a quarter-of-a-f*cking-billion-dollar check when we had no money,” and helped execute a winning GOP strategy. But Musk, he added, was out of sync with a populist economic project more than a decade in the making.', '', '', 'Musk’s public spat with Trump began on Tuesday, when the former DOGE head began attacking the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, warning that it would “bankrupt” the country. Democrats rubbernecked from the sidelines, happy to watch Musk make some of their arguments, skeptical that it would amount to anything.', '', 'Pro-Trump conservatives were on surer footing. They saw the end of Musk’s advocacy for policies that clashed with their vision, including visas for highly skilled immigrants and tax credits for electric vehicles. And they spied victory over the GOP’s libertarian wing — down to a handful of congressional Republicans, and Musk — who were more worried about deficit reduction than immigration.', '', '“Debt is an important issue,” the pro-Trump influencer Jack Posobiec wrote on X. “But there is one issue that is more important than all others, and that is Immigration. This bill funds the Mass Deportations.”', '', 'This faction of MAGA notched one victory before Trump took office. The day after Christmas, when he was slated to lead DOGE alongside Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy defended tech companies that “hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over ‘native’ Americans,” arguing that modern America didn’t venerate the right skills or ethics.', '', '“A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy wrote.', '', 'Ramaswamy left DOGE just hours into the Trump presidency, launching a run for governor of Ohio that Trump would soon endorse. But his riff on American competitiveness, and the need for more smart immigrants, became infamous on the nationalist right.', '“When an outsider comes here, gets in your face, and starts throwing definitions at you, and you gotta Google sh*t? We’re not doing that,” said the comedian Sam Hyde in a livestream dedicated to Ramaswamy. “You’re getting called a slur.”', '', 'Musk, who had taken Ramaswamy’s side in the argument, kept his role in the administration. He was publicly supportive of moves taken to cut grants for Ivy League schools.

The Department of Government Efficiency remains in place; Democrats and liberal groups are still suing to undo its work. And the Musk/DOGE effort to demolish USAID fulfilled a basic nationalist project, pulling back resources for noncitizens and giving the money to Americans. (The agency’s offices are being refitted for Customs and Border Protection.)', '', 'But the long-term Trump project, which has been succeeding all year, is transforming the Republican Party from Reaganite national greatness to nationalism — more like Viktor Orban’s Fidesz than George W. Bush’s GOP. As progressives and ex-Republicans fret about foreign scientists fleeing the country, as they quote Emma Lazarus and Martin Niemöller, Trump’s Republicans are raising tariffs and funding more border wall construction.', '', 'How far would Trump go to punish Musk? Maybe not as far as Bannon, who wants the government to seize SpaceX and his citizenship. The punishment matters less than the policy, which is to stop seeing the national debt as an existential threat, and understand immigration as an existential threat. Who wins if Trump-endorsed Republicans run on that, and candidates backed by a Musk PAC talk about cutting the deficit? The ending to that story is even more predictable than the ending of this one.', '', 'California Rep. Ro Khanna, a personal friend of Musk, believed that he could be brought back to the Democratic Party after his fight with Trump. Few Democrats agreed, even though some were using Musk’s “disgusting abomination” language against the OBBBA.', '', 'Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said that the donors and voters who helped beat Musk’s candidate in the state’s supreme court race “drove a chisel into a crack in the Republican Hoover Dam,” and got a “historic villain, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people,” to slink out of politics.', '', '“A few months ago, politicians in both parties were terrified about crossing Trump, because they thought Musk might fund a primary campaign against them,” Wikler told Semafor. “He was Trump’s No. 1 enforcer. Now, he’s been pushed out of the palace, and he’s responding by trying to burn the whole thing down.” Musk’s approval rating with Democrats, he said, was “somewhere between anthrax and the bubonic plague.”', '', 'US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are unlikely to hold a phone call today, after Trump said that Musk had “lost his mind” and was “not particularly” interested in talking to his former advisor. A White House official later told Reuters that no call is planned.', 'Trump’s comments suggest that his feud with Musk remains ongoing, despite earlier reports that the two may have been attempting to reconcile, following an explosive online falling out on Thursday.', 'The feud — Musk alleged Trump was mentioned in the Jeffrey Epstein files; Trump threatened to end Musk’s government contracts — sent Tesla’s stock price slumping 14% on Wednesday, while Republicans scrambled to stop it damaging their legislative agenda.', 'The GOP largely backed Trump, while The Information said the rift “doesn’t necessarily signal a broader break between tech and the White House.”', 'NATO leaders agreed their most ambitious military expansion since the Cold War.', 'The US and NATO leadership are pushing to increase the alliance’s spending target from 2% of each member country’s GDP to 5%, including 1.5% on related defense expenditures such as logistics and cybersecurity.', 'While major countries such as the UK are holding out on the higher target, arguing that the priority should be pushing all allies to meet their existing commitment, the deal is expected to be finalized in a summit this month.', 'The alliance also pledged a five-fold increase in surface-to-air defense systems, and set out a detailed list of each country’s specific contributions to NATO’s military capabilities.', 'The US Supreme Court blocked a case brought by Mexico’s government that alleged that American gun makers sell weapons they know will be funneled to cartels.', 'Despite the unanimous decision to block the case, both Washington and Mexico City agree that Mexican cartels get most of their weapons from US sellers; the guns are used to defend drug trafficking which has led to record overdose deaths in the US.', 'A recent survey showed at least two-thirds of the hundreds of thousands of weapons seized in Mexico each year come from the US, as is the case across much of Latin America, a factor in it being the world’s most dangerous region.', 'Harvard University secured a temporary order blocking President Donald Trump’s proclamation that sought to bar international students from attending the institution.', 'US District Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that enforcing the proclamation to restrict student visas would cause “immediate and irreparable injury” to Harvard, which has more than 7,000 international students and researchers. She set a hearing for June 16.', 'When the administration announced the proclamation on Wednesday, Trump argued that Harvard’s failure to disclose information on international student misconduct threatened national security.', 'The CEO of artificial intelligence company Anthropic called on the White House to drop its plan to limit AI regulation.', 'Dario Amodei said a provision in President Donald Trump’s bill to place a 10-year moratorium on state-level regulation of AI was “far too blunt” with AI advancing “head-spinningly fast.”', 'He called instead for a national framework requiring leading firms to disclose their safety policies and efforts to reduce AI risk.', 'Amodei — who warned last week that technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in five years — is not the only AI boss calling for regulation of the technology: DeepMind’s leader recently called for internationally agreed rules to implement safeguards across borders.', 'Russia’s central bank cut interest rates for the first time since late 2022, as policymakers fear a red-hot wartime economy could tip into a downturn.', 'Most of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected the bank would lower borrowing costs, which currently stand at a record 21% in order to rein in inflation levels that are more than double the bank’s target.', 'The bank — which is relatively independent in an otherwise largely centrally directed economy — faces a tricky balancing act: Russia’s economy minister said this week a growing number of industries are in decline, while a report for the EU last month warned that “time is not on Russia’s side.”', 'US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone Thursday, and plan to hold trade talks soon, Trump said.', 'The US president wrote in a post on Truth Social that the call lasted one and half hours, and focused exclusively on trade. He added that a US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would meet with a Chinese team for negotiations “shortly,” and that both leaders extended invitations to visit each other’s countries. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said the call was initiated at Washington’s request.', 'The talks come amid persistent tension between the world’s two largest economies, and after Trump posted Wednesday that the Chinese leader was “extremely hard to make a deal with.”', 'The phone call is the first time that Trump and Xi are confirmed to have spoken since the US leader’s return to office in January. Since then, the pair had slapped huge tariffs on each other, before agreeing a truce last month.', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged US President Donald Trump to put more pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, even as the American leader suggested there wasn’t much he could do.', 'Merz, who took office one month ago and in February said Europe needed “independence” from the US, avoided an Oval Office blowup with Trump through “a great deal of mutual flattery, which is known to be Trump’s most important currency,” Der Spiegel wrote.', 'Despite the congenial encounter, the meeting highlighted the gulf between Europe and Trump on ending the war: Trump spoke of the conflict as if he were a bystander, The New York Times noted, comparing Russia and Ukraine to “two young children fighting like crazy.”', 'The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the eighth time in the past year on Thursday, lowering borrowing costs to 2%.', 'The quarter-percentage-point cut comes in response to slowing eurozone inflation, in part owing to US trade restrictions, but analysts are divided on whether the central bank will further reduce borrowing costs. The ECB’s growth forecast for 2025 remains unchanged, signaling expectations of steady if modest economic expansion.', 'Particularly intriguing is the future of its boss: ECB chief Christine Lagarde has discussed cutting her term short in order to replace Klaus Schwab as the head of the World Economic Forum, WEF’s founder told the Financial Times last week. “Any move by Lagarde to accelerate her departure… could trigger a succession race,” the FT noted.', 'The European Union gave Bulgaria the green light to join the euro, but political ructions in Sofia threaten to torpedo its accession.', 'The European Commission and European Central Bank’s approval for Bulgaria to become the 21st country to join the common currency marks a significant step for the Balkan nation, which joined the EU in 2007 and has pegged its lev currency to the euro since 1999.', 'Yet domestic enthusiasm for the euro has waned, with half of Bulgarians now skeptical of the currency union and far-right parties demanding a delay or dismissal of the plans.', '“For Bulgaria, the main hurdle is not the economic criteria, but the political dynamics… of whether or not to join,” Eurointelligence said.', 'A clash between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk burst into the open Thursday, as disagreements over Republicans’ spending bill quickly morphed into a personal feud.', 'Musk, once a close Trump ally and adviser, has repeatedly criticized the Trump-backed package. Trump said Thursday that he was “disappointed” in Musk’s pushback, and threatened to cut government contracts and subsidies for the tech mogul’s businesses, which include SpaceX and Tesla. Musk said Trump wouldn’t have won the White House without his support.', '“This tension is about more than just a bromance falling apart,” WIRED wrote: Republicans fear Musk’s criticism could drag down a key part of Trump’s legislative agenda.', 'German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will today push for reduced American tariffs in his first meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC.', 'Merz will also highlight his country’s increased defense spending and press for stronger American support for Ukraine, hoping to leverage what has so far been a positive, if distant, relationship: The two former businessmen text each other and are on a first-name basis, Handelsblatt noted.', 'The visit is crucial for Merz — Germany’s huge manufacturing and carmaking sectors are particularly vulnerable to Trump’s steel and auto tariffs — but he also has cards to play, The Wall Street Journal said, and is expected to argue that Washington needs Europe in order to present a unified front against China.', 'President Donald Trump signed an order banning nationals of 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, from entering the US, and imposed heavy restrictions on citizens of a further seven nations.', 'A similar policy in Trump’s first term targeted migrants from mostly Muslim countries, but hit legal roadblocks; the new approach, which the White House said was driven by national security, is more robust, experts told The New York Times. Trump said Sunday’s attack by an Egyptian man in Colorado underscored the “extreme dangers” of foreign nationals, although Egypt was not on the list of banned countries.', 'A broader immigration crackdown has also swept up elite American universities: Trump on Wednesday suspended visas for those studying at Harvard.', 'US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said after a meeting with alliance counterparts in Brussels that there was a “near consensus” over raising NATO’s defense spending target to 5% of GDP.', '“Countries in there are well exceeding 2% and we think very close, almost near consensus, on a 5% commitment for Nato,” Hegseth said.', 'The alliance is expected to sign a new pledge at a NATO summit this month increasing defense spending targets to 3.5% of GDP and add a 1.5% target for security-related infrastructure such as cyber capabilities and transportation.', 'Many countries already spend roughly 1.5% of GDP on the types of infrastructure expected to be included in the pledge, but the figure would allow US President Donald Trump to say the alliance is setting the 5% spending target he has demanded, a Western official told Semafor.', 'The US vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.', 'All 14 other members backed the measure, but the US voted against, saying that the wording did not condemn Hamas.', 'US-Israel relations have cooled in recent months — President Donald Trump did not visit the country during his recent Middle East tour, and his relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is tense, with disagreements including over the best way to deal with Iran.', 'But Washington remains firmly behind Israel on the war, to the frustration of the UN: Its humanitarian chief said the scenes of people being “shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat” were “horrifying.”', 'US President Donald Trump renewed his clash with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after new jobs data suggested hiring is slowing.', 'The private sector added just 37,000 jobs last month, down from 60,000 in April and well below the 110,000 expected by economists, according to research firm ADP.', 'Trump lashed out at “‘Too Late’ Powell” — despite inflation risks, the president has repeatedly urged the Fed to proactively cut rates, suggesting that he’d likely blame Powell for any coming slowdown, Axios wrote.', 'The labor market won’t provide the same buffer for the economy that it did in 2022 and 2023, economist Claudia Sahm warned, noting that job openings have dropped and workers aren’t moving between roles as frequently.', 'Moscow is planning to retaliate after Ukraine’s surprise drone strike over the weekend, US President Donald Trump said after speaking to Russia’s leader Wednesday.', 'Vladimir Putin insisted “very strongly” that Moscow must respond to the attack on Russian airfields, Trump said, setting up a further escalation in the conflict even as the US pushes for a ceasefire.', 'Trump said his conversation with Putin was not one “that will lead to immediate peace”: He is growing frustrated with both Russia and Ukraine, The New York Times reported.', 'Trump’s policy toward the Kremlin is “at a dead end,” international relations scholar Edward Fishman wrote in Foreign Affairs, arguing the White House should work with Congress to pursue tough, targeted oil sanctions on Russia.', 'Transparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.', '']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iI0NnNVVZMk00TWxSamMyOTNhbXRQVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdB=-w280-h168-p-df

Deportation of a naturalised citizen is rare and generally requires evidence of fraud or serious criminal activity related to the naturalisation process. Therefore, despite the controversy, Musk’s current citizenship status provides him strong legal protection against deportation.', 'The US Constitution grants certain protections to everyone in the country, regardless of immigration status. These include due process rights, meaning that individuals are entitled to fair legal procedures before the government can take action against them.', 'Past immigration scrutiny', 'This isn’t the first time Musk’s immigration status has come under scrutiny. In the past, allegations surfaced that Musk may have worked in the US without proper authorisation while on a student visa in the 1990s.

The two have publicly clashed over various issues, including Trump’s proposed policies.', 'The RBI’s 50 bps rate cut and 100 bps CRR slash aim to balance inflation and growth. The shift to a neutral stance signals a possible pause, though more cuts may follow in FY26 if inflation stays low.

Musk Launches Furious Retaliation Against Steve Bannon for Urging Trump to Punish Him,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-launches-furious-retaliation-against-steve-bannon-for-urging-donald-trump-to-punish-him/,"['Elon Musk has hit back at Steve Bannon after the longtime MAGA hardliner called on President Donald Trump to “seize” SpaceX.', 'Following this week’s nuclear fall-out between Trump and top campaign donor Musk—who until last week was also one of the president’s most important advisers—Bannon slammed Musk’s government cost-cutting efforts and called for him to be deported.', '2/2', 'During Thursday’s episode of his War Room podcast, he also referred to a social media exchange between the former allies in which Trump threatened to cancel Musk’s government contracts, and Musk responded that SpaceX would “begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.', '“When he threatens to take one of the big programs out of SpaceX, President Trump tonight should sign an executive order calling for the Defense Production Act to be called and seize SpaceX tonight before midnight,” Bannon said.', 'Generally speaking, the 1950 act doesn’t give the government the power to “seize” companies. Instead, it allows the president to control domestic industries during emergencies by ordering companies to prioritize orders from the federal government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.', 'The president also has the power to allocate materials, services and facilities for production, make loans or loan guarantees to companies, and prevent hoarding of necessary supplies.', 'Both Democratic and Republican administrations have routinely used the act to place military orders, bolster domestic production of critical materials, and increase production of medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the CFR.', 'Rather than point any of this out, Musk responded to Bannon by calling him a slur favored by middle-school bullies—and MAGA culture warriors.', '“Bannon is peak r----d,” the Tesla chief wrote in response to a post on the social media platform X. Under another post calling Bannon’s comments “authoritarian,” the Tesla chief repeated the slur, writing, “Bannon is a communist r----d.”', 'Ever since NASA officially ended the Space Shuttle program in 2011, it has relied on outside vehicles to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.', 'Originally, they traveled aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, but now, NASA relies heavily on SpaceX’s four-person Dragon capsule, which was developed with the help of government contracts.', 'Unable to help himself, Bannon also warned during Thursday’s show that a scorched-earth Musk would turn to backing Democratic candidates and “help steal the ’28 election, looking to imprison President Trump.”', 'Bannon was of course one of the leading conspiracy theorists leading the claim that Joe Biden “stole” the 2020 election from Trump.

,https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/steve-bannon-nationalize-spacex,"['Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.', 'I had planned to write something on the possible Google remedy, but the political world is riveted by the bitter feud that has broken out between the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, and the President, Donald Trump. Though the fight feels a bit like pro-wrestling and may not last long, the insults back and forth are mean-spirited and bitter, and were accompanied with threats.', 'From a market power perspective, there is potential policy fallout, and that’s what interests me. Trump said he might cut Elon Musk’s government contracts, which are largely centered in his rocket company, SpaceX. That’s a big deal, because the company runs much of our space program. In the last quarter of 2023, SpaceX lifted up 90% of all pounds sent into orbit, which makes it a monopolist in launching satellites. It provides the only vehicle that astronauts have to get to and from the International Space Station.', 'There’s more. A big part of SpaceX is the communications satellite company Starlink, which has around two thirds of all satellites in space and has a dominant lead in its market, allowing people to get broadband internet with a small dish anywhere on the planet. Starlink is so important that it is a key geopolitical weapon. Musk has made the call to allow or disallow Ukraine from using Starlink terminals for different warfighting purposes, giving this individual sovereign-level powers.', 'After Trump threatened Musk today, Musk responded by saying he would use his power to jeopardize U.S. interests.', 'It’s not clear if he was joking, but even a joke threat makes the point. Decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft would harm the International Space Station and hinder U.S. encrypted communications, some of which flow over Musk’s network.', 'One result of this fight is that Steve Bannon, a close advisor to Trump, has suggested that Trump use the Defense Production Act - a legacy law from mid-century that allows the government to use civilian industrial capacity for national security purposes - to take over SpaceX. Here’s the clip.', 'Bannon is correct in his argument. Something like launch capacity to space, especially when it’s a monopoly, or a vital communications network like Starlink, are too important to be controlled by one guy. And it’s government funded anyway, having received $22 billion in direct Federal monies, and more every year, with immense public support in the form of permissions to launch and knowledge built on top of the public space program.', 'Bannon’s argument isn’t just about seizing private power. It’s true that SpaceX’s rockets that bring satellites into space are reusable and efficient, and his company has won because its technology is better than rivals such as Blue Origin and Boeing. But there’s also a real monopolization problem. Here’s the New York Times discussing the company’s tactics a year ago:', 'The new generation of space entrepreneurs trying to emulate Mr. Musk is sufficiently concerned about what they see as his anticompetitive tactics that some of them are now willing to take him on publicly.', 'Tim Ellis started Relativity Space after being inspired by Mr. Musk’s pursuit of a rocket that could carry humans to Mars. Then he heard from other industry executives that individuals with ties to SpaceX were trying to block his efforts to raise money for his own Mars project.', 'Jim Cantrell worked with Mr. Musk at the founding of SpaceX in 2002. When he started to build his own launch company, Phantom Space, two potential customers told his sales team they could not sign deals because SpaceX inserts provisions in its contracts to discourage customers from using rivals.', 'Peter Beck, an aerospace engineer from New Zealand, met in 2019 with Mr. Musk to talk about Mr. Beck’s own launch company, called Rocket Lab. Several months later, SpaceX moved to start carrying small payloads at a discounted price that Mr. Beck and other industry executives said was intended to undercut their chances of success.', '“I don’t think this is an accidental monopoly,” Mr. Beck said in an interview about SpaceX and Mr. Musk. “These are business decisions that are being made.”', 'Rivals allege two main tactics for the launch part of the monopoly. First, SpaceX allegedly charges below cost in certain contexts to prevent competitors from getting into the market. Second, the company inserts “right of first refusal” provisions with customers, meaning that it has the right to match competitors if they make a better offer. Both of these are classic moves of an aspiring monopolist. There are likely others tactics of course, rumors that Starlink gets better pricing from SpaceX launches than other rival satellites, which is self-preferencing. And there’s the sabotaging of funding rounds, plus the need for large amounts of capital and regulatory barriers to entry.', 'So there is a legitimate reason that the government has to use the Defense Production Act to take over SpaceX, since Musk is threatening to sabotage vital interests over a political spat. Normally, I’d support Bannon’s argument, and also call for an antitrust investigation and action, as that should have happened long ago. But this is the Trump era, and there’s a reason that didn’t happen', 'Talking about key national infrastructure in the context of two enormously powerful men calling each other pedophiles on Twitter is extremely weird. We’re in an oligarchy, and nothing screams that as much as this fight. And I will make an observation about how miserable it must be to work in this administration in a political capacity, because keeping your job and/or advancing means expressing zeal for cults of personality that can change at any moment.', 'Musk’s politics are those of a standard Reagan libertarian - low corporate taxes, free trade with China, bad labor standards, lots of immigration - and he fits in well with the Republican establishment. But he’s both immensely wealthy, and he has a cult of personality almost as big as Trump. Before this fight, the cringe adoration for Musk among GOP officials was overwhelming. For instance, the FBI set up a task force to look at anti-Tesla vandalism, every agency investigating parts of Musk’s empire was dismantled, the FCC and Commerce Department redirected broadband subsidies to Starlink, and trade reps helped Musk’s broadband company get contracts in India, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Lesotho, using the threat of tariffs as a lever. The State Department even tried to order $400 million of electric armored cars from Tesla, before being exposed and embarrassed.', 'I’m not making a corruption argument, though obviously the conflicts of interest here are insane. I’m making a slightly different point. For the last three years, and then increasingly since Trump took office, every Republican official with less than a billion dollar net worth has been bending over backwards to be as obsequious as possible to Musk. When told to jump they ask how high, they self-righteously attack and ferret out anyone who had anything to do with anything that might slightly annoy Musk. It’s little stuff, like this, which I’m guessing Musk didn’t ask for but some random Trump staffer thought might get him a promotion or a positive word from the boss.', 'Since they don’t know what they want in terms of a governing agenda, and they aren’t getting clear direction, Trump officials are just trying to please the most powerful cult of personality they see. They are acting out of fear, a constant sense of exhaustive social climbing.', 'And now, everything that these people have done, all the worshipping of DOGE and Musk, all the extra subsidies they’ve tried to slip Musk’s way, is that for nothing? Have the rules changed? Will they now be criticized for what they thought they were supposed to be doing?', 'That’s one of the problems with oligarchy. It really is arbitrary, and it sucks for everyone, not just those victimized by the vagaries, but even for those working for the oligarchs. That is one reason the rule of law matters and why institutional integrity is useful. Being at the utter whim of powerful men who can change their mind whenever, without consequence, well, it’s a terrible way to run a country. It took us a thousand years to develop democratic systems and get us away from this kind of arbitrary and capricious behavior. Hopefully we’ll start to remember what we have before we lose it.', 'In the meantime, yeah, we should treat SpaceX and Starlink like the public utilities they are. And if Trump really wanted to go after Musk, he’d send the Federal Trade Commission after SpaceX to look at some of its contracts and pricing choices. But we’re aways from that, even if an enterprising state official might be able to do it.', 'Thanks for reading!', 'And please send me tips on weird monopolies, stories I’ve missed, or comments by clicking on the title of this newsletter.

This was an example of how to find ways to reach across the aisle. This example resonated with me, because I had already been in this position when Bannon and Musk were going at it earlier this year, which seems like eons ago.
