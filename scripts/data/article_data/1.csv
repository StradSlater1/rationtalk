California under attack: A weak and failing Donald Trump seeks a punching bag | Opinion,https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article308232985.html,"['', 'Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting.', 'With his national agenda on the brink as the United States Senate balks at trillions in additional debt, and as President Donald Trump loses the support of the world’s richest man in Elon Musk, the president has chosen to shift attention westward, back to his favorite punching bag. Instead of giving Los Angeles the tens of billions of dollars the region needs to recover and rebuild from January’s devastating fires, Trump instead dispatched federal law enforcement to round up immigrants outside of a Home Depot — then called in the National Guard.', 'This feels like nothing short of an attack on California, the nation’s largest state and a global engine of innovation, by our president. This weekend’s events were merely the excuse Trump needed to test this state in ways we have never confronted before.', 'How can any state succeed when its leader wants it to bend to his political will or fail?', 'The effects of Trump’s growing war against California will only worsen over time. So far, D.C. has denied $40 billion in economic assistance and reimbursements for rebuilding Los Angeles, and the city and the state face an unimaginable financial blow. In addition, Trump’s global trade war has already halved activity at the once-busy Port of Los Angeles.', 'But that’s not all: Trump officials are looking to defund grants to numerous state agencies, billions in federal funding for the High Speed Rail project are now in jeopardy and roughly a million Californians could lose their Medi-Cal health insurance if the president gets his way by denying care as a way to decrease taxes for the nation’s most fortunate.', 'We aren’t yet halfway through the first year of Trump’s term in office, but the pattern is fast emerging — and the reality is evident: We’re on our own.', 'California has only begun to come to terms with this reality. Los Angeles can seem a world away from Northern California, but our state’s largest city has been preparing for the global stage: In 2026, it will host games of the globe’s largest sporting tournament, soccer’s World Cup. In 2028, it will host the Summer Olympics. If Los Angeles shines, the country shines. Yet Trump doesn’t want to invest in Los Angeles’s success.', 'And what is Trump doing? He has dispatched law enforcement from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to raid garment factories, Home Depot parking lots, and donut shops. He has stripped our governor of his ability to manage protests that started calmly. He has sought to tear Los Angeles down in hopes of rehabilitating his own shaky standing.', 'And to what constructive end?', 'Sadly, the attacks on the Golden State play well elsewhere, but a clear pattern has emerged: The rest of the nation is not immune.', 'California — Los Angeles in particular — is in the president’s crosshairs today. But it will be Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle or New York tomorrow. Trump is promising Americans as much.', '“We’re going to have troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country,” the president told reporters on Sunday. “If we see danger to our country, to our citizens, we’ll be very, very strong in terms of law and order.”', 'This is a suffocating level of hypocrisy, coming from a president who was slow to respond to the Jan. 6 siege of the nation’s Capitol.', 'It was perhaps inevitable that Trump would choose California as his lead target. But we are not the lone innovator under siege; the nation’s universities, medical research apparatus, and perhaps soon our space program are all under financial attack. Trump so far isn’t building anything other than a larger apparatus to deport immigrants. And he is centering the destruction on places and institutions once without peer in the world.', 'The geopolitics of this state make it hard to unite in the best of times. Our great regions, such as the Central Valley, Southern California, the Central Coast, and the Bay Area, are so different from one another.

They're now on standby."", 'Tam, this is clearly a fight that Donald Trump wants. What is his strategy in escalating the response?', 'Tamara Keith:', 'President Trump, if you go back to his first term in office, he wants wanted to use the military, use force against protesters.', 'He sees the violent imagery, he sees it on television, and his reaction is to want to send in the military. Back in 2020, he said — quote — ""If the looting starts, the shooting starts""', 'There were — that was in Minnesota that he was referring to, but there were also protests that turned violent in California back then. Now he\'s saying, ""If they spit, we will hit.""', ""He seems to have a rhyme for every occasion, and he's into this. He wants this fight. He wants this fight with the state of California. Even before this happened over the weekend, late last week, he was talking about wanting to take funding away from California, urging his departments to find ways to take funds from California."", ""California's governor was pointing out that California pays more in taxes than it receives in federal services. This was a fight that's been brewing, and now it is at a whole 'nother level."", 'Geoff Bennett:', ""It's worth mentioning the protests in some places did turn violent."", 'Tamara Keith:', 'Absolutely.', 'Geoff Bennett:', ""The chief of the LAPD at one point said he wasn't entirely sure, maybe they did need more help, maybe they did need more National Guard resources."", 'But on this point of President Trump, Amy, using the military to paint this perception of toughness and to send a signal to other Democratic-led states and cities, what do you make of it?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Yes.', ""No, I think that's true, and I do think that's why it's been so interesting to watch the Democratic response, especially of Democratic leaders, not just in the state, but nationally. To Tam's point about this is a fight that Donald Trump wants, Democrats know that too. They can see the poll numbers. They remember 2020. They remember 2024."", ""And when it comes to issues like this, whether it's crime, whether it is, and now, today, on the issue of immigration, Donald Trump has the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't have on a lot of other issues. So this is a fight that he wants to have. What Democrats are saying is, let's not give him more fuel to keep this fight going."", ""You see the mayor of Los Angeles, Gavin Newsom, others saying, please, if you want to protest, that's great. Don't turn it violent. Don't allow this to turn into something that benefits Donald Trump, the signs, the scenes of chaos and police in the streets."", ""The question going forward, I think, is how Democrats do talk about these issues, it's going to be really important for the — not just what's happening today in Los Angeles, but just writ large. I think there has been a lot of pullback and a lot of hand-wringing from Democrats about an issue which they used to have an advantage on during the — Trump's first term, they have a disadvantage on now."", ""This issue isn't going away. And how Democrats respond to whether this is going to happen in other states, how they address concerns about safety and security, that is going to be critical just for the next — well, forever long."", 'Geoff Bennett:', 'Well, the risk for Democrats.', ""What are the risks for President Trump? Immigration, as you both said, his number one issue.It's number one in terms of that's the one that he cares the most about, but it's also the one from which he derives his best approval numbers."", 'Amy Walter:', 'Yes.', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'The risks of overreach.', 'Tamara Keith:', ""Yes, I think that there definitely isn't a risk of overreach. There is also a risk of the Trump administration looking like they are desperately trying to boost their numbers because they haven't been able to have the sort of sweeping mass deportations that they promised coming into office."", 'So part of this is about trying to visibly keep that promise while also picking a fight with California. One thing I will note is that, in California itself, the population of California, 73 percent of adults in the Public Policy Institute of California survey from February of this year said that there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally. A vast majority say that immigrants benefit California.', 'So, in terms of the population of the state, his view is not popular in the state, but that also sort of heightens the fight, which is what he wants.', 'Geoff Bennett:', ""In the time that remains, let's talk about the infighting within the Democratic National Committee, because Politico reported that the current DNC chair, the new DNC chair, Ken Martin, just months into the job, he privately told Democratic leaders that his new vice chair, David Hogg, you see him there, is making it hard to lead the party."", ""And Hogg has vowed to spend millions of dollars in safe blue primaries to oust incumbent Democrats that he views as ineffective. Now, you can say most people aren't really paying attention to what's happening within the DNC right now, but the DNC, in my view, plays a more central role when the party lacks a clear, unifying leader. So what's all this mean and what's it mean for the party?"", 'Tamara Keith:', ""Yes, there's this quote from Ken Martin that I saw where he says he took this job to fight Republicans, not Democrats."", ""But, right now, Democrats are fighting with each other in terms of the DNC and this leadership fight. There is a decision being made about whether they should take a revote on who — on this position that Hogg is in currently. There used to be a commandment in politics that you don't go after incumbents from your own party. Hogg's view is not that."", 'And, also, he is — David Hogg is remarkably good at getting attention. Ken Martin, that is not his greatest skill set, is getting attention.', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'Amy?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Yes, and I think it speaks to the broader conversation that Democrats are having about, who do we want to be going forward? David Hogg represents the younger generation that has felt incredibly frustrated with Democratic politicians, really going all the way back to 2016, when young voters said, we want Bernie Sanders.', ""They have actually said that in three successive elections. So this is a fight actually Democrats should welcome having right now, because 2028 is when they want — they should want the team to be on the same page. If you're going to get there, you got to have the disagreements, whether it's of the DNC, but it's certainly going to be happening within primaries and just more broadly within conversations with the Democratic Party leadership."", 'Geoff Bennett:', 'So get it out of the way in June 2025.', 'Amy Walter:', 'Right.', 'Geoff Bennett:', ""Don't let this be happening in October…"", 'Amy Walter:', ""That's right, in June of 2028."", 'Geoff Bennett:', ""That's right."", 'Tamara Keith:', 'Well, they may or may not be able to control that for themselves here.', '(Crosstalk)', 'Geoff Bennett:', 'We shall see.', 'Amy Walter and Tamara Keith, thanks to you both.', 'Tamara Keith:', ""You're welcome."", 'Amy Walter:', ""You're welcome."", 'Watch the Full Episode', 'Jun 09', 'By Michael Liedtke, Associated Press', 'Jun 09', 'By Gisela Salomon, Associated Press', 'Jun 09', 'By Calvin Woodward, Nathan Ellgren, Associated Press', 'Jun 09', 'By Jason Dearen, Jaimie Ding, Jake Offenhartz, Associated Press', 'Jun 09', 'By Associated Press', 'Geoff Bennett', 'Geoff Bennett serves as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS News Hour.

Trump is a student of what works on television because that is precisely how he learns about the world. If his White House TV screen is filled with scenes of burning cars and rock-throwing protesters, that is exactly what most Americans are seeing, too.', 'So Trump ramps up the rhetoric and action.

There is no rebellion,” Bonta said in a statement, as reported by The Washington Post. “The president is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends.”', 'The idea that Newsom would sue Trump over violent protests in Los Angeles is a losing proposition for the governor in the court of public opinion.

Cillizza, on his YouTube channel, said Democrats should denounce the violence rather than “blame Donald Trump.” (RELATED: Dem Rep Really Upset That ICE Agents Wore Masks When Making Arrests)', 'WATCH:', '“Democrats appear entirely comfortable with playing along on this, which is colossally stupid from a political perspective,” Cillizza said, taking aim at Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for daring border czar Tom Homan to “come after [him]” and “arrest” him.', '“[Newsom] was on MSNBC on Sunday night where he basically said, like, to Tom Homan … he basically said, ‘Why doesn’t Tom Homan just come and arrest me? He’s not such a tough guy.’ I don’t know why that would — this is not about Gavin Newsom, right?” Cillizza added. “To personalize it like that makes no sense.”', 'He also called out Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters for her comments on the riots.', '“She said, quote, ‘I don’t know why we have guns. What are those guns for? Are they to shoot protesters?’ Again, if you are looking at the images coming up on your TV screen — cars on fire, looting, people defacing buildings—and then you hear Maxine Waters say, ‘What are these cops doing?’ That feels tone-deaf to me, right?” Cillizza said. “It feels as though Maxine Waters doesn’t get it, that people are like, ‘What? Like, this doesn’t make sense.’ Given what we’re seeing on TV, this appears to be … ‘Yes, law enforcement should respond to those things,’ right? Again, you must pick fights on your preferred ground.”', ""“What Democrats should say is, ‘Look, we condemn all violence. There should be no violent protests. People, if they want to protest, need to do it peacefully. Any violence is not what we support. But we do want to have a serious conversation about Donald Trump’s deportation policies and what they mean for this country, in Los Angeles, in border towns, and across the country,'” he added. “That’s the conversation Democrats can win on. They will not win on a conversation about clashes in the streets over Donald Trump’s immigration policies.”"", 'CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten noted on Monday that Trump’s approval rating on the issue of immigration has surged by 20 points among the American electorate since June 2017, citing his own aggregate data.', 'Los Angeles rioters burned cars, threw Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks, and vandalized property with slogans such as “KILL ICE.” Trump announced he would deploy 2,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles on Saturday, prompting angry reactions from both Newsom and Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.', 'Former Democratic Strategist Dan Turrentine also said on “The Morning Meeting” Monday that the Democratic Party has “lost its mind” based on its reaction to the riots, suggesting members of his party were condoning the rioters’ actions.', 'All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump's war with California will test MAGA's limits,https://www.salon.com/2025/06/09/with-california-will-test-magas-limits/,"['During the last months of last year\'s presidential campaign, Donald Trump would hold his rallies in places like Pennsylvania and complain about Vice President Kamala Harris\' home state of California being a violent hellscape that had its residents cowering in terror of the rampaging hordes of immigrant criminals who were routinely killing people in their beds. He would often complain that the police were hamstrung by ""woke"" policies that wouldn\'t allow them to take the gloves off. At one of his rallies, Trump even daydreamed about what he would do about it if he became president again: allow the cops to have ""one really violent day.""', ""His crowds loved it. He's always entertained them with his lurid, violent fantasies. It's one of the things they love about him."", 'Californians didn\'t love it so much, however. The fact that Harris hailed from the state was certainly an invitation for him to trash the state, but he\'d been doing that long before Harris was in the race. In fact, despite owning a house and a golf course in Los Angeles, Trump has been openly hostile toward California ever since it failed to vote for him in 2016. During his first term, he raged at the state for failing to ""clean the floors of the forest,"" which he claimed was responsible for the fires that hit Northern California. As The Atlantic\'s Ron Brownstein reported, during the global pandemic crisis, he demanded that if the Golden State wanted pandemic supplies and federal help, they would need to ""ask nicely"" and capitulate on issues like sanctuary cities. Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called such requests a ""blue state bailout"" and suggested that the state should go bankrupt if it requests relief during the global emergency. Trump behaved similarly toward other blue states, but reserved a special portion of his ire for California.', 'He started his second term by maligning Los Angeles during the devastating wildfires in January. He fatuously insisted that if the state had listened to him about ""turning on the valve"" in Northern California to release water to the south from Canada, there would have been no fires. He even ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to release millions of gallons into a flood plain and then weirdly claimed that he\'d ""invaded"" Los Angeles and solved its water problem.', 'Related', 'He never had a word of sympathy for the victims of the tragedy. All he could do was blame the governor, who he immaturely calls Gavin ""Newscum.""', ""All that was bad enough. But now he's pretty much declared war on Los Angeles."", 'Ever since Trump came into office with his mandate for ""Mass Deportation Now,"" he\'s been impatient with the pace and the numbers. What was touted as a plan to rid the country of violent gang members has proved to be less fruitful than he promised. He always meant to deport as many immigrants as possible, regardless of their legal status or criminal history. (Why else would he pounce on the Haitian community as he did?) As the Washington Examiner reported last week, Trump\'s enforcer and shadow president Stephen Miller brought the hammer down on ICE in recent days, instituting a quota and demanding that they stop looking for criminals and start arresting people at their workplaces, schools and outside places like Home Depot and 7-Eleven.', 'I live here and I can validate the fact that immigrants in this city are part of the fabric of our lives ... Nobody here is asking for this.', ""They've been doing smaller raids around the country for some time. But after Miller's edicts, they are now waging full-scale assaults. They've come to LA, with its large Latino and Asian immigrant communities, carrying assault weapons and wearing masks, to make an example of the already stressed city, which is still recovering from an epic natural disaster. What better way to demonstrate our new constitution-shredding, authoritarian police state? (And, naturally, it happens to be Stephen Miller's hometown, which he has loathed since he was an angry xenophobic misfit at Santa Monica High School.)"", 'Last week, ICE began a series of large-scale raids, naturally provoking protests from the community. As the demonstrations against them escalated over Friday and Saturday, ICE lied about the LAPD failing to help protect them, clearly as a way to allow Trump to deploy the National Guard.', 'He claimed it was a riot. Los Angeles knows what a riot is. We have had real ones here, and this is not that. He did not ask the governor to deploy the National Guard, as he is expected to do. He instead evoked a very rarely used law that was last applied in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson to protect civil rights workers from local police, allowing him to federalize those troops.', 'Start your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'He issued a memorandum ordering ""at least 2,000"" troops to the city of LA for ""no less"" than 60 days. It instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, most recently a former Fox News weekend host, to order active duty military on standby as well. Several hundred of these federalized California National Guard troops entered the city on Sunday. All this action did was escalate tensions and prompt more unrest. But then, that was the point.', ""I live here and I can validate the fact that immigrants in this city are part of the fabric of our lives. There have always been many undocumented workers here and they're part of the community — they're our families, friends and co-workers. We value them and the contribution they make culturally and economically. Nobody here is asking for this. Having militarized federal cops and active duty troops raiding our neighborhoods and violently grabbing people off the streets is the real invasion, not the people who've been living and working here forever."", ""And it isn't going to be just us. Liza Goiten, director of the National Security Project at the Brennan Center, told CNN:"", '[Trump\'s] memorandum doesn\'t even mention Los Angeles. It authorizes the deployment of federalized national guard forces and active armed duty forces anywhere in the country where protests against ICE activity are occurring regardless of whether those protests involve any violence or in places where protests are simply likely to occur. And that could really be anywhere in the country. That kind of pre-emptive nationwide deployment of the military to effectively police protests is unprecedented, incredibly dangerous and an abuse of any law the president might be relying on. ""', 'On Sunday, Donald Trump spoke to the media and promised that ""we\'re going to have troops everywhere.""', 'Late last night, he posted this:', ""We can probably expect to see even more escalation by Trump in the coming days. The state of California is filing suit, so perhaps the court will stay his hand temporarily. But that won't be the end of it. If they rule that he cannot use this rarely used law, he will almost certainly invoke the Insurrection Act and, if necessary, declare martial law. This is just the beginning. Anyone who lives in a blue American city should get ready. They're coming for you, too."", 'Read more', 'about this topic', ' ', 'Heather Digby Parton, also known as ""Digby,"" is a contributing writer to Salon.

,https://www.thebulwark.com/p/los-angeles-was-destined-to-be-where-trump-staged-his-ice-immigration-fight-protests-democrats,"['WHEN JOURNALIST RYANNE MENA TOOK TO THE STREETS of Los Angeles Friday to cover the protests against ICE, she figured she knew what to expect. As a Southern California News Group reporter whose beat includes crime, public safety, and (recently) immigration, Mena had covered her share of protests.', 'She’d never been shot before, however. But as she was covering it all from outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, that’s precisely what happened.', 'A protester threw a desk chair at an entrance to the detention center, prompting agents to launch a fusillade of pepper balls and rubber bullets. Mena was hit with a pepper ball projectile on her upper-left thigh, leaving a nasty bruise and the dark realization that this would be unlike any protest she’d covered before.', 'The next day brought further affirmation, as federal agents shot Mena again, this time with a rubber bullet that hit her on the right side of her head an inch above her ear. She and another journalist who was hit were then both tear-gassed by men Mena said were Homeland Security Investigations agents responding to protests in Paramount, California, after the ICE raid targeting the area around a Home Depot sparked the weekend’s protests. She posted photos to Instagram documenting her and her colleague’s injuries.', '“It’s very violent, and it seems intentional,” Mena told The Bulwark. The Trump administration, she added, “is using Los Angeles as an example.”', 'Mena has her reasons to believe this. As she noted, Los Angeles “has a longstanding history of large protests going back to the civil rights era.” The city is also filled with immigrants. “Everyone knows someone who isn’t authorized to be in this country, so this hits home for Angelos because immigrants are the lifeblood of our city.”', 'Far from the musings of just one reporter on the ground, Mena’s comments reflect an emerging consensus of those pushing back on the Trump administration in this most precarious moment: L.A. was chosen for a reason; the White House wanted this to be their staging ground.', 'Support our coverage of these important stories by becoming a Bulwark+ member today:', 'The first reason for this belief is historical: Los Angeles has for decades been a frequent site of major civil rights–related protests, from the 1968 East L.A. walkouts, when thousands of Chicano students protested inequality and prejudice in the public education system; to the riots in 1992 over the acquittal of police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King; to historic protest marches in 2006 for immigration reform.', 'The second point has to do with demographics. In covering that rollout so far, I’ve often written about Louisiana’s detention centers, which have come to be known for human rights abuses and for making detainees inaccessible to their lawyers and families. In such deep-red states, there’s also a sense among undocumented people that they are clearly, vastly outnumbered—and also with fewer allies. In that context, it makes sense to try to evade any kind of public scrutiny, to keep your head down and your profile low to try to keep your family together.', 'But Los Angeles? It’s almost half Latino; immigrants really are, as Mena said, the lifeblood of the city and the state. In L.A., nearly half a million people live in mixed-status families. Paramount—where agents sought out day laborers outside Home Depot after Stephen Miller suggested more Home Depot raids were needed—is 82 percent Latino, according to census figures. Once reports spread of the ICE offensive, it was only a matter of time before people took to the streets to defend their families, friends, and neighbors.', 'Share', 'THAT’S THE HISTORICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CONTEXT through which to view these protests. There is a similarly important political context too.', 'We are long past the phase of “mass deportation” in which bad actors or those with scary rap sheets are the main focus. Real, hard-working people—taken from the L.A. garment district or in front of a Home Depot while trying to find work—are being targeted. Americans were promised a crackdown on criminals and are instead watching masked people destroy families. Some were pleased to hear this. But others either did not believe Trump when he said he would do this or did believe him and opposed him—and it’s many of those people who now are rising up to say no.', 'Flor is one of those saying no.1 She’s a 24-year-old graduate student in Los Angeles, and her dad—who has lived in the United States for 27 years, quietly working and providing for his three daughters for all that time—was one of the garment workers seized outside Ambience Apparel on Friday by agents in tactical gear, helmets, and masks.', 'After the 9:30 a.m. raid, her father was taken to the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in downtown L.A. Democrats reacted with alarm to the news that immigrants were being held in the basement of the building, which was not designed to hold immigrants for long periods. Flor was trying to establish that her father was there, and she said officials used the protests outside as an excuse to cut off visitation.', 'Officers inside the federal building told lawyers to return between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday and family members to return between 1 and 4 p.m., but Flor came at 7 a.m. to try to visit with her father. She never got the chance. While outside, she caught a glimpse of him and other immigrants being put into white vans to be shuttled to the Santa Ana USCIS offices. On Sunday, they were then moved to Adelanto ICE Processing Center two hours away. Each step of the way, Flor joined with activists and members of other families also dealing with what she was going through to try to get answers and figure out how to see their detained loved ones.', 'Flor learned resilience from her dad, she says, a man who has always worked, including in sweatshops, as the sole provider—“emotionally and financially”—for her and her sisters, who have gone on to succeed as college graduates and graduate students. Her father likes bike rides and is a fan of both Club America, a Mexican soccer club, and Real Madrid. When Flor played soccer, he made sure she had the pricey gear she needed. When she went through her ballet phase, he was there, too, paying for it all.', '“He supported us through his labor and always wanted to give us a better life,” Flor told me. “They’re not doing these things to go against the law, they’re doing it to provide for their kids, to have a better job, and have good homes.”', 'Share', 'THESE STORIES, AND TRUMP’S DELIBERATE actions, have put Los Angeles on edge. And they’ve raised challenges for those who recognize that the president is trying to fan the flames rather than calm them. What is the best way to respond to it?', 'Angelica Salas, a veteran immigration leader for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), watched as Flor did everything she could to see her father again, impressed with the young woman and speaking to her about her plight.', 'Salas told me that she expects Democrats to have the backs of Californians who are standing up to fight back against ICE. The question is what should that support look like?', 'Her view is that the real way through this is to find enduring solutions to the problems at hand. There are, after all, 13 million people who have been denied access to legal status—the result of inaction and neglect on the part of both major parties. As for now, she says Democrats have a responsibility to do everything in their power to back the cause of immigrants.', '“On the Democratic side, this has to be an unapologetic fight for immigrants because it’s a fight for U.S. citizens now, too,” she said. “This is one of our most vulnerable communities, and we’re being used as a political piñata—they’re beating us up and denying due process. We cannot live like this.”', 'Smarten a friend’s inbox or social media feed:', 'Share', 'The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has begun picking up the fight, even inviting “tough guy” border czar Tom Homan to arrest him. But for folks like Salas, more is needed. She challenged Newsom last month for proposing cuts to health care for undocumented immigrants in his budget.', '“Someone has to stand with us and see us as your constituents,” she said. “They have to use their power at every level of government to stop this travesty.”', 'Many Democrats did credit Congressional Hispanic Caucus members for showing up to ICE facilities across the country to conduct oversight, which led to their being rebuffed (and sometimes charged with crimes) by federal officials. But they say the party has to do more.', '“How will they get loud?” asked Alida Garcia, a veteran immigration advocate and Latino vote organizer for Kamala Harris. “This only gets worse when [Trump’s spending and tax cut] bill passes and Homan has a green light to hire 10,000 people, build millions of dollars in cages, and get a whole fleet of jets to send people God knows where.”', '“I want to see Democrats not afraid to fight to defeat the expansion of the authoritarian regime,” she continued. “A lot of people will act like it’s a border bill, but it’s a family-separation-and-raid-workers-at-workplaces bill.”', 'Leave a comment', 'Share The Bulwark', '“Flor” asked to have her identity masked to protect her family.', 'He picked the wrong state and the wrong city. Perhaps it’s time for the West Coast states to consider secession—our combined economies would be the fifth largest in the world.', 'Since every action is personal with Trump, he’s long hated Los Angeles. He never got that Emmy, his show was canceled, and Hefner made it clear that Trump couldn’t just waltz into his mansion, select a playmate, and escort her upstairs.

That was followed by orders on Monday to send 700 Marines to join them, and then later in the day, with an order for 2,000 additional National Guard troops.', 'Even though the demonstrations have been largely contained to specific areas and mostly peaceful, Mr. Trump claimed on social media that the protesters were “insurrectionist mobs” and that Los Angeles had been “invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals.”', 'In endorsing harsh law enforcement tactics against immigration protests, Mr. Trump is picking a political fight on ground that Republicans believe is advantageous terrain.

To put it the way an alliterative TV news chyron might, think “CALIFORNIA IN CHAOS,” with President Trump stoking the fire by tweeting about immigrant invasions and rampant lawlessness.', 'TV news and social media excel at offering snapshots of what’s happening, but not the big picture. So the images emanating from L.A. (and the outlying city of Paramount, one many Angelenos likely couldn’t find on a map) fueled the distorted scenario that Trump and his acolytes pushed, capitalizing on the fact that those information conduits and their viewers are drawn to the conflict like moths to the (literal, in this case) flames.', 'Granted, more sober voices tried to clarify the overall dynamic — observing that Trump’s tweets, for starters, were untethered from reality. Yet given the power of his megaphone and the legions who parrot his claims, it’s hard to sway an audience that might have never been to California, or that lacks the media literacy to grasp a few hundred people taking to the streets — in a state with 40 million residents — doesn’t translate into widespread chaos.', '“Most people in L.A. probably don’t even know that this is going on,” CNN national security analyst and Harvard professor Juliette Kayyem pointed out on Saturday. “It’s such a big city, and we need an administration that’s not going to get to Defcon 1 every time they see something on TV they don’t like.”', 'Expecting or even hoping for restraint from Trump, however, merely reflects naïveté, especially because he and his advisors so obviously relish the idea of painting a blue state as something out of a “Mad Max” movie, provoking confrontation and creating cover to try implementing a military response.', 'That’s all red meat for Trump and his base, playing into the stereotypes of California that Fox News pushes with regularity. Small wonder he’s been spoiling for a fight with the state and its leaders, threatening to cut off federal funding even before the weekend’s flare-up.', 'By that measure, the few protesters that engaged in violence are playing right into his hands, as his weekend social media tirade — “BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!,” he said in one all-caps, three-exclamation-point salvo — made utterly transparent.', 'The onus for behaving responsibly thus shifts to news organizations and social media commentators with cooler heads, not to downplay or diminish what’s happening but rather to provide what’s so often the first casualty in the breaking coverage of such events: Context.', '“There are a few protests downtown, and yesterday’s drama was in a suburb 30 minutes away,” Pod Save America’s Jon Favreau tweeted in response to Trump’s bluster, accurately capturing the geography of what had transpired. “We’re the biggest county in America, with 10 million people, and you wouldn’t know anything is up unless you read the news or happen to be downtown.”', 'So how has the media fared in the early stages of this manufactured crisis? Predictably, not terribly well.', 'On Saturday, for example, CNN cut away from its post-game coverage after televising a live performance of “Good Night, and Good Luck” to interview a reporter at the scene in Los Angeles. Then again, the panel assembled to discuss the Broadway show’s lessons in a town-hall-type setting represented the kind of journalism the play’s subject, Edward R. Murrow, almost surely would have hated, a bit of irony that seemed to elude everyone participating in the forum.', 'Ultimately, having a reporter going live at a chaotic, fast-moving event often doesn’t tell you very much. That’s certainly the case in a situation like the one unfolding in Los Angeles, where Trump’s ICE raids rounding up undocumented immigrants have unleashed anger and prompted fear within local communities, while playing to Trump’s xenophobic appeal and helpfully shifting the focus away from other topics, like the pending tax bill and breakdown of Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk.', 'Thanks to social media and satellites, the immediacy of information has never been faster, but the tradeoff is that the ability to digest and understand what we’re seeing easily gets lost in the shuffle. And unless you live in L.A., the images create powerful impressions that play into preconceived notions without knowing exactly what you’re seeing, in the same way footage out of Gaza or Ukraine can often turn out to be misleading once we’ve had a chance to absorb and sort out the details of the deeper story behind the pictures.', 'Murrow could have explained all this, were he still alive, but he’d need to find a sympathetic platform to amplify those views. Alas, as things stand right now, the odds are Fox News wouldn’t have put him on at all, MSNBC would simply let him preach to the choir, and CNN would have cut away from interviewing him to see what its squabbling, both-sides-ing panel of experts had to say.', 'The post Trump’s ‘California in Chaos’ Dystopia?

Not just the officers. Everyone who watched it. That hasn\'t changed,"" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who responded to the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  ', ""Dunn and some of the other victims of the U.S. Capitol siege are angry about the Trump administration's public statements and response to this weekend's unrest in Los Angeles, accusing top officials and the president of hypocrisy. They point to the stark difference between the aggressive response of the president and his top aides against those who allegedly assaulted police in Los Angeles, compared to their staunch defense of those who admitted beating and gassing police on Jan. 6. The disparity risks inflaming the already heated controversy in California."", '""Trump still calls January 6 a \'day of love\' and it\'s total bulls***,"" Dunn told CBS News. ', '""Hypocrisy is the key word,"" he said. ""Trump thinks anything done in his name is OK. Jan. 6 was done in his name, so our officers don\'t matter.""    ', ""Some of the Trump administration's top national security leaders have issued forceful public statements criticizing the people accused of confronting and assaulting police in Los Angeles, amid a weekend of unrest over federal immigration raids. Those statements are stirring anger or frustration by Capitol siege victims, who are still outraged by the pardons President Trump issued to more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants — including approximately 600 accused of assaulting police. "", 'On Saturday, FBI Director Kash Patel wrote a social media post stating, ""Hit a cop, you\'re going to jail… doesn\'t matter where you came from, how you got here, or what movement speaks to you."" ', 'A day later, deputy FBI director Dan Bongino wrote, ""If you choose violence tonight, this message is for you. We will be investigating and pursuing all available leads for assault on a federal officer, in addition to the many arrests already made.""', '""It feels like those posts should have an asterisk, which says \'effective now.\' They\'re fine with police officers that got assaulted and attacked on January 6,"" Dunn said, blasting those posts.', 'Brendan Ballou, a former federal prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 criminal cases, told CBS News, ""For Trump, the law applies to his enemies but not his friends. He calls protesters in Los Angeles \'insurrectionists\' while praising those who attacked the Capitol on January 6 as \'patriots\' and \'warriors.\'""   ', '""His use of language is deliberate: it is an attempt to rewrite history and to create a false equivalency between the protests happening now and his attempt to subvert democracy in 2021,"" Ballou added. ""I hope that those following don\'t fall for it.""', ""Democrats in Congress have also noted the contrast in Mr. Trump's decision to order the National Guard to California this weekend, despite his delay in doing so to help save the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. In a speech that morning, Mr. Trump exhorted his followers to go to the Capitol and protest the certification of the 2020 election. Just before 2 p.m., the Capitol Police chief declared a riot and requested help from the National Guard. About 2.5 hours elapsed before Mr. Trump released a video telling his supporters to go home. The National Guard arrived at the Capitol four hours after the police chief requested the troops."", 'Rep. Glenn Ivey, a Maryland Democrat who represents a large number of congressional employees, told CBS News, ""The hypocrisy is unmistakable.""', '""President Trump has urged the immediate deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, despite the governor and mayor saying it\'s not needed,"" Ivey said. ""Yet he delayed sending the guard on Jan. 6, when insurrectionists stormed the Capitol, violently attacked police and targeted Mike Pence and Nancy Pelosi.""', 'In social media posts Monday, some of the convicted Jan. 6 rioters have argued that the Los Angeles unrest is larger in scale and size than the U.S. Capitol siege. In an X post that received 1 million views in its first 12 hours, a side-by-side image of a fiery and smoke-filled moment from the Los Angeles unrest is shown next to a quieter moment during the attacks from the Capitol riot. ', 'pic.twitter.com/5oLh9TpZmC', 'Dunn argued other layers of hypocrisy risk further inflaming tensions. He said outrage among Trump supporters over the waving of Mexican flags by crowds in Los Angeles minimizes the horror of the Confederate flags that were paraded on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6.', 'The blistering criticism of people who were part of the crowds and confrontations with police in Los Angeles marks a sharp contrast with the treatment of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt by  Mr. Trump and his allies. She was on the front lines of the Jan. 6 mob as it breached the House Speaker\'s Lobby and was shot and killed by a Capitol Police lieutenant as she entered a smashed window in a doorway. Mr. Trump has called Babbitt a ""patriot,"" and the Trump administration recently reached a legal settlement to give a multimillion-dollar taxpayer-funded payment to Babbitt\'s family.', 'Harrison Fields, principal deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement, ""The same media that calls the chaos and anarchy in Los Angeles \'peaceful protests\' and distracts the American people with played out narratives is the same media that covered for Biden when he allowed more than 20 million illegal immigrants into our country.""', 'He added that Mr. Trump ""was elected to secure the border, equip federal officials with the tools to execute this plan, and restore law and order"" and added that the protests underscore the need to pass the legislation containing Mr. Trump\'s second-term agenda, to ""provide record funding and resources to those on the front lines in Los Angeles."" ', ""The FBI has not responded to a request for comment on the disparity of its leadership's reaction to Jan. 6, compared to the L.A. protests.

Was it all a set-up?""', 'Patel initially defied requests for information from the House Jan. 6 Select Committee, though he did appear before the panel in December 2021. At his Senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Patel was accused of referring to violent Capitol rioters as ""political prisoners.""', ""The FBI also did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News about Patel and Bongino's statements."", 'Mr. Trump has consistently defended Capitol rioters as patriots who were victims of a ""weaponized"" Justice Department during the Biden administration.', 'Rep.

Trump’s ‘California in Chaos’ Dystopia? Not if You Live Here,https://www.thewrap.com/trump-california-ice-raids-immigration-real-situation/,"['The administration and its media allies paint a distorted, politically motivated picture that’s untethered from L.A.’s reality but made for social media', 'For most people in Los Angeles, it was a run-of-the-mill weekend. There were kids baseball and soccer games, pleasant weather for getting outdoors, and Dodgers games on TV.', 'On cable and local news, though, as well as X and other strident quadrants of social media, the scene was far less idyllic, playing into the dystopian narrative the Trump administration clearly wanted to advance regarding demonstrations over immigration policy. To put it the way an alliterative TV news chyron might, think “CALIFORNIA IN CHAOS,” with President Trump stoking the fire by tweeting about immigrant invasions and rampant lawlessness.', 'TV news and social media excel at offering snapshots of what’s happening, but not the big picture. So the images emanating from L.A. (and the outlying city of Paramount, one many Angelenos likely couldn’t find on a map) fueled the distorted scenario that Trump and his acolytes pushed, capitalizing on the fact that those information conduits and their viewers are drawn to the conflict like moths to the (literal, in this case) flames.', 'Granted, more sober voices tried to clarify the overall dynamic — observing that Trump’s tweets, for starters, were untethered from reality. Yet given the power of his megaphone and the legions who parrot his claims, it’s hard to sway an audience that might have never been to California, or that lacks the media literacy to grasp a few hundred people taking to the streets — in a state with 40 million residents — doesn’t translate into widespread chaos.', '“Most people in L.A. probably don’t even know that this is going on,” CNN national security analyst and Harvard professor Juliette Kayyem pointed out on Saturday. “It’s such a big city, and we need an administration that’s not going to get to Defcon 1 every time they see something on TV they don’t like.”', ""Kayyem: Active duty Marines for this? I mean, we were just reporting on it. There's music. The traffic is moving. Most people in L.A. probably don't even know that this is going on. It's such a big, city, and we need an administration that's not going to get to defcon one every… pic.twitter.com/DvyQBNTG4W"", 'Expecting or even hoping for restraint from Trump, however, merely reflects naïveté, especially because he and his advisors so obviously relish the idea of painting a blue state as something out of a “Mad Max” movie, provoking confrontation and creating cover to try implementing a military response.', 'That’s all red meat for Trump and his base, playing into the stereotypes of California that Fox News pushes with regularity. Small wonder he’s been spoiling for a fight with the state and its leaders, threatening to cut off federal funding even before the weekend’s flare-up.', 'By that measure, the few protesters that engaged in violence are playing right into his hands, as his weekend social media tirade — “BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!,” he said in one all-caps, three-exclamation-point salvo — made utterly transparent.', 'The onus for behaving responsibly thus shifts to news organizations and social media commentators with cooler heads, not to downplay or diminish what’s happening but rather to provide what’s so often the first casualty in the breaking coverage of such events: Context.', 'Trump: “BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!” pic.twitter.com/jBpakI1ZJQ', '“There are a few protests downtown, and yesterday’s drama was in a suburb 30 minutes away,” Pod Save America’s Jon Favreau tweeted in response to Trump’s bluster, accurately capturing the geography of what had transpired. “We’re the biggest county in America, with 10 million people, and you wouldn’t know anything is up unless you read the news or happen to be downtown.”', 'So how has the media fared in the early stages of this manufactured crisis? Predictably, not terribly well.', 'Absurd.\n\nThere are a few protests downtown, and yesterday’s drama was in a suburb 30 minutes away. We’re the biggest county in America, with 10 million people, and you wouldn’t know anything is up unless you read the news or happen to be downtown. pic.twitter.com/7HB21bkBhX', 'On Saturday, for example, CNN cut away from its post-game coverage after televising a live performance of “Good Night, and Good Luck” to interview a reporter at the scene in Los Angeles. Then again, the panel assembled to discuss the Broadway show’s lessons in a town-hall-type setting represented the kind of journalism the play’s subject, Edward R. Murrow, almost surely would have hated, a bit of irony that seemed to elude everyone participating in the forum.', 'Ultimately, having a reporter going live at a chaotic, fast-moving event often doesn’t tell you very much. That’s certainly the case in a situation like the one unfolding in Los Angeles, where Trump’s ICE raids rounding up undocumented immigrants have unleashed anger and prompted fear within local communities, while playing to Trump’s xenophobic appeal and helpfully shifting the focus away from other topics, like the pending tax bill and breakdown of Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk.', 'Thanks to social media and satellites, the immediacy of information has never been faster, but the tradeoff is that the ability to digest and understand what we’re seeing easily gets lost in the shuffle. And unless you live in L.A., the images create powerful impressions that play into preconceived notions without knowing exactly what you’re seeing, in the same way footage out of Gaza or Ukraine can often turn out to be misleading once we’ve had a chance to absorb and sort out the details of the deeper story behind the pictures.', 'Murrow could have explained all this, were he still alive, but he’d need to find a sympathetic platform to amplify those views. Alas, as things stand right now, the odds are Fox News wouldn’t have put him on at all, MSNBC would simply let him preach to the choir, and CNN would have cut away from interviewing him to see what its squabbling, both-sides-ing panel of experts had to say.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWlUVXBHUkVneE1XOXJNek01VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZRnNJQjExQUk=-w280-h168-p-df

I think what Democrats are doing and saying about all this is politically insane.

They’re basically guarding federal installations out there, which frees up more police that don’t have to do that to make the arrests and try to bring about order,” Hume added.', 'Hume then discussed Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who supported the use of federal troops, citing local polling. (RELATED: Authoritarian Flexing’: Linda Sanchez Says Sending Troops To Los Angeles Riots Doesn’t Make ‘Anyone Safer’)', '“Karen Bass has seen polls that suggest that people do support it. She’s the mayor, of course. I think she said that if it was local polling, it might be different.

Trump Should Crush the L.A. Riots—with a Subtle Hand,https://www.city-journal.org/article/los-angeles-riots-trump-deportation-national-guard-immigration,"['How the president can restore order and win the war for visual symbolism', 'Los Angeles is burning. Earlier this year, seasonal fires ripped through the Southern California city, but now, the fires are entirely manmade. In response to the Trump administration’s deportation policy, left-wing activists and opportunistic rioters have taken to the streets to vandalize property, incinerate automobiles, and assault law enforcement officers. The images emerging from the city are shocking: thugs hurling rocks from an overpass onto police; men spinning motorcycles around burning debris; a masked, shirtless rioter waving a Mexican flag atop a burned-out autonomous car.', 'In short, the Left is giving President Trump all the visual symbolism he needs to advance his immigration agenda. Most Americans see chaos in the name of a foreign flag and find it repellent. Though Trump’s language about a migrant “invasion” has sometimes been dismissed as hyperbolic, it seems that the Left is intent on turning it into a material reality.', 'Finally, a reason to check your email.', 'Sign up for our free newsletter today.', 'The question: How should the president respond? Many on the right may feel an instinctual reaction to “send in the troops.” While this concern for law and order is natural and merited, it must be pursued in a way that maximizes the chance for success and minimizes the chance for blowback. As the president considers his options, he might keep in mind a number of strategic points that, if implemented, will increase his leverage in the fight for large-scale deportations.', 'The administration must deny the Left a strong visual counterargument. It’s easy to see how scenes of militarization, abuse of demonstrators, or a violent death could reverse public sympathies and present the administration as abusing its authority. The language of politics is visual—and therefore emotional, which means that a single mistake can reverse the flow of opinion and imperil the president’s immigration agenda. Left-wing tacticians have trained their foot soldiers to bait law enforcement into confrontation and to play victim for the press, to great effect.', 'To prevent this scenario, Trump has a number of strategic options available to him. First, rather than sending in more troops to stop the fires, the president might be better advised to hold off. Right now, California governor Gavin Newsom has sided with the demonstrators, but if the riots spread further, this stance will cost him in public opinion, and eventually, he will have to assume the mantle of authority. The public will expect Newsom to restore order, and he’ll have to incur the risk of using force.', 'Second, the president should pressure local leaders to buy in to the task of quelling the riots. He could wait for Governor Newsom to request the National Guard or appear at a press conference with Los Angeles County officials, bringing state Democrats into the risk-reward calculus and creating the option for the president to shift the blame in the future if they fail to respond effectively. California Democrats are anticipating that Trump will assume all the authority and, therefore, relieve them of any responsibility. He should resist the temptation to be the only player on the field with skin in the game.', 'Third, the president should direct federal agencies to create a hard-soft, or visible-invisible, approach to riot control. In public, the National Guard should mobilize with enough manpower to smother the protests and avoid protracted conflict or hand-to-hand combat, which carries with it the highest level of risk. At the same time, as we saw demonstrated in Portland, Oregon, during the George Floyd riots, the agencies should dispatch unmarked vans to follow key agitators and snatch them from the streets while the media are not looking. The most effective riot control is to take movement leaders off the field, infiltrate their networks, disrupt the flow of funding, and roll them up in federal investigations. Denying the Left trained protest leaders now will create a strong precedent for the rest of the president’s term.', 'President Trump has often tweeted “law and order” in all capital letters. This is a powerful formulation—half a century ago, it won Richard Nixon a landslide reelection—but especially in today’s media environment, it must be carried out subtly and with an eye toward visual language. To reestablish order on the streets but lose the war for public opinion would constitute an empty victory and a real danger to the president’s agenda.

Yet their most visible response to the anti-deportation riots in Los Angeles has been to denounce President Trump for sending National Guard troops to quell the riots. The situation, they insist, is under control—or at least it was, until Trump intervened.', 'This view is not shared by some in charge of actually doing the quelling. As Los Angeles police chief Jim McDonnell admitted at a Sunday evening press conference: “We are overwhelmed. . . . Tonight, we had individuals out there shooting commercial-grade fireworks at our officers. . . that can kill you. . . . They’ll take backpacks filled with cinder blocks and hammers, break the blocks, and pass the pieces around to throw at officers and cars, and even at other people.”', 'Ruy Teixeira is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the co-founder of the Substack The Liberal Patriot.']",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWlUVXBHUkVneE1XOXJNek01VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZRnNJQjExQUk=-w280-h168-p-df
Trump's war with California will test MAGA's limits,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-war-california-test-magas-131632329.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'During the last months of last year\'s presidential campaign, Donald Trump would hold his rallies in places like Pennsylvania and complain about Vice President Kamala Harris\' home state of California being a violent hellscape that had its residents cowering in terror of the rampaging hordes of immigrant criminals who were routinely killing people in their beds. He would often complain that the police were hamstrung by ""woke"" policies that wouldn\'t allow them to take the gloves off. At one of his rallies, Trump even daydreamed about what he would do about it if he became president again: allow the cops to have ""one really violent day.""', ""His crowds loved it. He's always entertained them with his lurid, violent fantasies. It's one of the things they love about him."", 'Californians didn\'t love it so much, however. The fact that Harris hailed from the state was certainly an invitation for him to trash the state, but he\'d been doing that long before Harris was in the race. In fact, despite owning a house and a golf course in Los Angeles, Trump has been openly hostile toward California ever since it failed to vote for him in 2016. During his first term, he raged at the state for failing to ""clean the floors of the forest,"" which he claimed was responsible for the fires that hit Northern California. As The Atlantic\'s Ron Brownstein reported, during the global pandemic crisis, he demanded that if the Golden State wanted pandemic supplies and federal help, they would need to ""ask nicely"" and capitulate on issues like sanctuary cities. Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called such requests a ""blue state bailout"" and suggested that the state should go bankrupt if it requests relief during the global emergency. Trump behaved similarly toward other blue states, but reserved a special portion of his ire for California.', 'He started his second term by maligning Los Angeles during the devastating wildfires in January. He fatuously insisted that if the state had listened to him about ""turning on the valve"" in Northern California to release water to the south from Canada, there would have been no fires. He even ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to release millions of gallons into a flood plain and then weirdly claimed that he\'d ""invaded"" Los Angeles and solved its water problem.', 'He never had a word of sympathy for the victims of the tragedy. All he could do was blame the governor, who he immaturely calls Gavin ""Newscum.""', ""All that was bad enough. But now he's pretty much declared war on Los Angeles."", 'Ever since Trump came into office with his mandate for ""Mass Deportation Now,"" he\'s been impatient with the pace and the numbers. What was touted as a plan to rid the country of violent gang members has proved to be less fruitful than he promised. He always meant to deport as many immigrants as possible, regardless of their legal status or criminal history. (Why else would he pounce on the Haitian community as he did?) As the Washington Examiner reported last week, Trump\'s enforcer and shadow president Stephen Miller brought the hammer down on ICE in recent days, instituting a quota and demanding that they stop looking for criminals and start arresting people at their workplaces, schools and outside places like Home Depot and 7-Eleven.', ""They've been doing smaller raids around the country for some time. But after Miller's edicts, they are now waging full-scale assaults. They've come to LA, with its large Latino and Asian immigrant communities, carrying assault weapons and wearing masks, to make an example of the already stressed city, which is still recovering from an epic natural disaster. What better way to demonstrate our new constitution-shredding, authoritarian police state? (And, naturally, it happens to be Stephen Miller's hometown, which he has loathed since he was an angry xenophobic misfit at Santa Monica High School.)"", 'Last week, ICE began a series of large-scale raids, naturally provoking protests from the community. As the demonstrations against them escalated over Friday and Saturday, ICE lied about the LAPD failing to help protect them, clearly as a way to allow Trump to deploy the National Guard.', 'He claimed it was a riot. Los Angeles knows what a riot is. We have had real ones here, and this is not that. He did not ask the governor to deploy the National Guard, as he is expected to do. He instead evoked a very rarely used law that was last applied in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson to protect civil rights workers from local police, allowing him to federalize those troops.', 'Start your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.', 'He issued a memorandum ordering ""at least 2,000"" troops to the city of LA for ""no less"" than 60 days. It instructed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, most recently a former Fox News weekend host, to order active duty military on standby as well. Several hundred of these federalized California National Guard troops entered the city on Sunday. All this action did was escalate tensions and prompt more unrest. But then, that was the point.', ""I live here and I can validate the fact that immigrants in this city are part of the fabric of our lives. There have always been many undocumented workers here and they're part of the community — they're our families, friends and co-workers. We value them and the contribution they make culturally and economically. Nobody here is asking for this. Having militarized federal cops and active duty troops raiding our neighborhoods and violently grabbing people off the streets is the real invasion, not the people who've been living and working here forever."", ""And it isn't going to be just us. Liza Goiten, director of the National Security Project at the Brennan Center, told CNN:"", '[Trump\'s] memorandum doesn\'t even mention Los Angeles. It authorizes the deployment of federalized national guard forces and active armed duty forces anywhere in the country where protests against ICE activity are occurring regardless of whether those protests involve any violence or in places where protests are simply likely to occur. And that could really be anywhere in the country. That kind of pre-emptive nationwide deployment of the military to effectively police protests is unprecedented, incredibly dangerous and an abuse of any law the president might be relying on. ""', 'On Sunday, Donald Trump spoke to the media and promised that ""we\'re going to have troops everywhere.""', 'Late last night, he posted this:', ""We can probably expect to see even more escalation by Trump in the coming days. The state of California is filing suit, so perhaps the court will stay his hand temporarily. But that won't be the end of it. If they rule that he cannot use this rarely used law, he will almost certainly invoke the Insurrection Act and, if necessary, declare martial law. This is just the beginning. Anyone who lives in a blue American city should get ready. They're coming for you, too.""]",U.S.,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWlUVXBHUkVneE1XOXJNek01VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZRnNJQjExQUk=-w280-h168-p-df
