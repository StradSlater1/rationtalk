He subsequently filed a $400 million lawsuit against Lively, Reynolds and Sloane, and a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times. Lively and Reynolds filed motions to dismiss in March. Sloane, for her part, requested to be removed from the case. The New York Times also filed to dismiss the suit that same month. In March, the judge granted the newspaper’s request to pause the lawsuit while the motion to dismiss was under review.', 'After news broke of Lively’s win in court, the actress took to social media to speak out about her legal situation.', '“Last week, I stood proudly alongside 19 organizations united in defending women’s rights to speak up for their safety. Like so many others, I’ve felt the pain of a retaliatory lawsuit, including the manufactured shame that tries to break us,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on Monday. “While the suit against me was defeated, so many don’t have the resources to fight back.”', 'Lively added that while she was able to have backing and support, she acknowledged that others do not have that same privilege.', ' ', '“I’m more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman’s right to have a voice in protecting themselves, including their safety, their integrity, their dignity and their story,” she continued. “There are protections out there.”', 'Lively shared a series of resources available to women in need of support, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and National Organization for Women.', '“With love and gratitude for the many who stood by me, many of you I know.

Since then, the two have communicated through warring legal teams and the press as they head toward their March 2026 court case.', ""Baldoni has denied all allegations and said that Lively's claims were false and designed to help Lively gain creative control of It Ends With Us. In response to Lively's allegations, which were reported by the New York Times and included texts between Baldoni and members of his team, he filed a $400 million countersuit against the actress, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and their publicist Leslie Sloane. The lawsuit alleges defamation and extortion, as well as a separate $250 million defamation suit against the New York Times."", ""But on June 9, Judge Lewis J. Liman threw out Baldoni's lawsuit, ruling that the statements at the center of the suits were either privileged or lacked the necessary legal basis for defamation.

""We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys’ fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation.""', 'It’s all very messy — and with the case headed to court in March 2026, there is almost certainly going to be more that will unfold. But how did It Ends With Us go from being a highly anticipated adaptation of a popular BookTok novel to being one of the entertainment industry’s biggest rifts to date? Here’s what to know.', 'Skip ahead:', 'How it all began', 'Blake Lively speaks out', 'Justin Baldoni pushes back', 'How Taylor Swift got involved', 'Where Deadpool comes in', 'Blake Lively breaks her silence in 2025', 'Lively drops her emotional distress claim', 'Lively and Baldoni starred together in 2024’s It Ends With Us, based on Hoover’s 2016 romance novel about a woman breaking out of the cycle of domestic violence. Baldoni, who initially got the rights to the book through his production company, Wayfarer Studios, also directed the film, while Lively was also an executive producer on the project.', 'When the movie came out in August 2024, fans noticed that Lively and Baldoni — who played a couple in the film — did not do interviews together or pose for photos at the movie’s premiere, fueling speculation that there was a rift between the two.', 'During the film’s press tour, Lively faced backlash for downplaying the story’s central theme of domestic violence, instead emphasizing female empowerment and the film’s floral aesthetic and even weaving in promotion for her newly launched hair care line. Social media buzz turned critical against the star as old interviews resurfaced that portrayed the actress as catty or rude. Meanwhile, Baldoni — whose brand and podcast Man Enough is centered on untangling himself from toxic masculinity — received praise for including domestic violence as part of the larger conversation about the film.', 'Lively had stayed quiet about her time on the It Ends With Us set and work with Baldoni — until December 2024, when she filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department. In her complaint, she claimed Baldoni engaged in sexual harassment and created a hostile work environment during the film’s production.', 'Her complaint coincided with a New York Times exposé titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine,” which detailed Lively’s allegations — along with her legal complaint — and highlighted the alleged retaliatory actions by Baldoni’s team. That included Baldoni encouraging publicists to drum up a smear campaign against the star, which Lively said was the driving force behind the sudden onslaught of negative social media comments about her.', 'Lively was initially met with some public support following the New York Times piece — people like her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants costars and her Another Simple Favor director Paul Feig spoke out in her favor — but in the weeks after the article, social media sentiment toward the actress remained negative.', 'On Dec. 31, 2024, Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times. The actor claimed that the article crafted a misleading narrative that damaged his reputation using cherry-picked communications — like, say, a quoted text message that omitted an emoji indicating sarcasm. The New York Times stood by its reporting and in February 2025 filed to dismiss the lawsuit.', 'On Jan. 16, 2025, Baldoni and his team — including Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath and PR reps Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel — filed a lawsuit in New York federal court. They accused Lively, her husband Reynolds and her publicist Sloane of defamation and other contract violations, while seeking a whopping $400 million in damages. In Baldoni’s version of events, Lively and Reynolds wanted to gain control over the making of It Ends With Us, and, when met with resistance, attempted to damage Baldoni’s reputation with a harassment claim.', 'In the days after his lawsuit filing, Baldoni’s team released footage from the It Ends With Us set in order to contradict some of Lively’s complaints about harassment. Later, in March, he launched a website with information about the situation for the public to view.', 'Also in March, Lively sought to have Baldoni’s lawsuit dismissed, citing California law on misconduct claims.', 'In May, pop superstar Taylor Swift was officially dragged into the mess, with a subpoena for the artist to appear in court. Swift is a longtime friend of Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and is also godmother to their four children.', 'The artist entered the conversation when messages between Baldoni and Lively came to light in Baldoni’s filing. In the lawsuit, she is referred to as Lively’s “megacelebrity friend,” and Baldoni claimed that Lively used her connection to Swift — whose song “My Tears Ricochet” is in the film — as leverage to take control of the set. That is the reason Swift was subpoenaed.', 'According to text messages between Baldoni and Lively, Swift was allegedly with Lively when she and Baldoni were discussing a scene from It Ends With Us that Lively wanted to change.', 'In one text exchange between her and Baldoni, Lively wrote of Swift and husband Reynolds, “If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you’ll appreciate that I’m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you.”', 'Swift’s reps, however, say that the singer’s only involvement in the film was allowing her song to be used in the movie.', '“Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see It Ends With Us until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,” her reps said in a statement to the press, stating that the subpoena was “designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.”', 'Though Swift’s team said her only role in the film was providing a song for it, as other artists who were not subpoenaed had done, Baldoni previously stated that she had a larger impact. He told reporters that Swift had watched a video of Isabela Ferrer, who plays a younger version of Lively’s character, and encouraged the casting decision — something that Ferrer also shared with the press.', 'In addition to Swift, her longtime law firm Venable was also subpoenaed. The subpoena, initially served April 29, demanded all communications between Venable and Lively, Reynolds and their attorney Michael Gottlieb. It specifically named Douglas Baldridge, a Venable partner who has represented Swift since 2013.', 'On May 12, Venable filed a motion to dismiss it, according to documents obtained by Billboard, calling it a “fishing expedition.” The firm stated that Venable is in no way involved in the lawsuit, and that any information Baldoni seeks should be sourced from Lively and Reynolds themselves.', '“Venable had nothing to do with the film at issue or any of the claims or defenses asserted in the underlying lawsuit,” the firm wrote, arguing the subpoena was designed “to distract from the facts of the case and impose undue burden and expense on a non-party.”', 'In a May 13 court filing, Reynolds and Lively supported Venable’s motion, calling it an “abuse of the discovery process.”', 'On May 14, however, Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman came back with a letter to the judge in the case, per People, stating that the decision to subpoena Swift was necessary under the circumstances. Freedman wrote that the team received a tip from what he believes to be a highly credible source that claimed that Lively urged Swift to delete text messages between the two of them.', 'The letter also alleged that Lively’s lawyer demanded that Swift release a statement of support for Lively over the Baldoni situation, suggesting that if the singer refused, “private text messages of a personal nature in Ms. Lively’s possession would be released,” the letter from Baldoni’s attorney read.', 'In a statement to People on May 14, Lively’s attorney Gottlieb denied the allegations, which he called “categorically false” and “cowardly sourced to supposed anonymous sources, and completely untethered from reality.”', '“This is what we have come to expect from the Wayfarer parties’ lawyers, who appear to love nothing more than shooting first, without any evidence, and with no care for the people they are harming in the process,” he continued. “We will imminently file motions with the court to hold these attorneys accountable for their misconduct here.”', 'On May 18, Lively\'s team filed a motion in New York’s Southern District Court that alleged Baldoni\'s lawyer made the claim that she extorted Swift as a way ""to seed harassing media narratives"" against the actress.', '“These public attacks, combined with the Rule 11 Plaintiffs filing numerous claims against Ms. Lively without any basis in law or fact, is willfully improper and warrants sanctions,” the legal document read, per the Wrap.', 'Lively\'s team also filed a second motion to compel Wayfarer Studios to hand over documents and recordings from what they call a ""disingenuous charade"" of an investigation into her sexual harassment on the It Ends With Us set. The filing accuses Wayfarer of failing to properly investigate her allegations, which include Baldoni allegedly discussing his sex life and staging improvised intimacy scenes without her consent. Her team argues that if a real investigation had taken place in 2023, it would have validated her claims — and that Lively would have been ""spared the retaliatory smear campaign"" she alleges Baldoni incited in its wake.', 'However, on May 22, the subpoena against Swift was dropped.', 'A spokesperson for Lively confirmed that Baldoni’s legal team has withdrawn subpoenas issued to Swift and her legal counsel — a move the spokesperson says they are pleased with.', '""We supported the efforts of Taylor’s team to quash these inappropriate subpoenas directed to her counsel, and we will continue to stand up for any third party who is unjustly harassed or threatened in the process,"" the spokesperson said in a statement obtained by People.', 'The statement also criticized the Baldoni and Wayfarer team’s handling of the case, suggesting they had attempted to use Swift’s fame for strategic advantage. ""The Baldoni and Wayfarer team have tried to put Taylor Swift, a woman who has been an inspiration for tens of millions across the globe, at the center of this case since day one,"" the spokesperson said. ""Exploiting Taylor Swift’s celebrity was the original plan in Melissa Nathan’s scenario planning document, and it continues to this day. Faced with having to justify themselves in federal court, they folded. At some point they will run out of distractions from the actual claims of sexual harassment and retaliation they are facing.""', 'Baldoni also called out Reynolds’s Marvel movie for allegedly attempting to damage his reputation — specifically with the character of Nicepool, portrayed by Reynolds but credited under the name “Gordon Reynolds.” In the film Deadpool & Wolverine, Nicepool is an alternative version of Reynolds’s sarcastic superhero Deadpool who sports long hair and a bun similar to a style worn by Baldoni in the past. Nicepool also calls himself a feminist and remarks on Lively’s character Ladypool’s postpartum body.', '“Reynolds portrayed Nicepool as a vicious caricature of a ‘woke’ feminist before concluding the character’s arc with his violent shooting death at the hands of ‘Ladypool,’ a character voiced by Blake Lively,” the suit states. It calls the character a “transparent and mocking portrayal of Reynolds’ warped perception of Baldoni.”', 'The It Ends With Us credits also thank “Gordon Reynolds.”', 'Lively and Reynolds kept a relatively low profile in the immediate wake of the lawsuit. However, the two have recently hinted at the drama at public events, one of which includes Lively and Reynolds’s February appearance at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary on Feb. 16 — their first public appearance together since the lawsuit broke. When asked how things were going by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, Reynolds jokingly responded with “Why? What have you heard?”', 'Baldoni’s lawyer Freedman addressed the moment on Billy Bush’s podcast, calling it “surprising” that they would joke about such serious matters.', 'At the 2025 Time100 Gala on April 24, where Lively was an honored guest after making its list of most influential people, she spoke about using her voice for good, saying, “Who and what we stand up for, and what we stay silent about, what we monetize versus what we actually live, matters.”', 'She also hinted at her legal battle, stating, “I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum.”', 'In a May appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers to promote Another Simple Favor, Lively also spoke about using her voice for change.', '“What I can say without getting too much into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life,” Lively told Meyers. “And I see so many women around, afraid to speak — especially right now — afraid to share their experiences. And fear is by design. It’s what keeps us silent. But I also acknowledge that many people don’t have the opportunity to speak. So I do feel fortunate that I’ve been able to. It’s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that’s kept me strong and helped me in my belief and my fight for the world to be safer for women and girls.”', 'According to court documents, on June 2, Lively chose to withdraw her emotional distress claims against Baldoni, which came after the director’s legal team requested access to Lively’s medical records. They argued the records were central to her allegations of emotional distress.', ""Baldoni’s team stated that rather than hand over her records, Lively is withdrawing her emotional distress claim, court papers cited by Variety stated. However, Lively wants to withdraw the claims without prejudice, meaning she could refile them later should she change her mind — something that Baldoni's team has pushed back against."", 'Baldoni\'s team argued that Lively is both refusing to disclose the documents needed to disprove that she suffered emotional distress, and/or that Baldoni and his production company were the cause. However, at the same time, she is maintaining the right to refile the claim ""at an unknown time in this or some other court after the discovery window has closed.” As of now, they have reached an impasse.', 'Lively\'s lawyers refuted that, stating that Baldoni\'s lawyers are not accurate in Lively refusing to hand over these documents. Instead, they said the team is ""intentionally misleading to the Court"" and that their ""intended audience"" for this ""false record"" was the public, alleging that Baldoni\'s lawyers are using this as a way to spin negative press about the actress. They stated that they are dropping the emotional distress claim to focus on other charges in court.', '“Once again, this is a routine part of the litigation process that is being used as a press stunt. We are doing what trial lawyers do: preparing our case for trial by streamlining and focusing it; they are doing what they do: desperately seeking another tired round of tabloid coverage,” they said, according to TMZ.', ""Lively's team stated that Lively still “alleged emotional distress, as part of numerous other claims in her lawsuit, such as sexual harassment and retaliation, and massive additional compensatory damages on all of her claims.”""]",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNU9iVFpIYmtoSVEzQkJRbXROVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdrTlVwckdvbWc5U1FJ=-w280-h168-p-df

& Wolverine,” Nicepool, was crafted by Ryan Reynolds as a caricature of Baldoni, Marvel Studios sent a letter to Liman asking the court to squash Baldoni’s subpoena for relevant documents, stating the claims are irrelevant to Baldoni’s claims of defamation and that releasing confidential Marvel documents would harm the studio.', 'April 24, 2025In an amended response to Jones’ lawsuit against Baldoni, which she filed in December accusing him of defamation and breach of contract, Baldoni accused Jones of colluding with Lively to file a “sham legal proceeding” in New York court in September

messages—which were central to Lively’s claims, and the basis for a New York Times story—sent among Baldoni’s team.', 'In a statement to Deadline, Jones’s lawyer Kristen Tahler accused Baldoni’s team

largely focused on abuse against women, a central theme of “It Ends With Us,” and revealed her mother was a victim of abuse.', 'April 13, 2025“It Ends With Us” storyboard artist Talia Spencer defended Baldoni in an interview with “60 Minutes Australia,” stating she felt Lively “smelled [Baldoni’s] kindness, mistook it for weakness and tried to take advantage and take power,” alleging Lively “tried

gynecologist pushed back against Lively’s description of a birthing scene in her lawsuit as “invasive and humiliating,” telling PageSix Lively wore a “full hospital gown, black shorts and torso-covering prosthetic” and was not “nearly nude” as she had claimed in her complaint.', 'March 20, 2025In a counterclaim to Jones’ December lawsuit against Baldoni and Abel, Baldoni alleged Jones attempted to undermine Abel’s authority as a PR representative for Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company, claiming she suddenly terminated Abel from her PR firm, seized her phone and leaked texts to Lively’s team, which the lawsuit says was done in response to Abel voicing her intent to leave Jones’ firm and Jones’ fear she would take Baldoni as a client with her.', 'March 20, 2025In her motion to dismiss, Lively slammed Baldoni’s “vengeful and rambling lawsuit” as a “profound abuse of the legal process,” urging the court to “dismiss all claims against Ms. Lively with prejudice, deny leave to amend, and award Ms. Lively all relief sought,” including attorney’s fees and damages for “reputational and emotional harm.”', 'March 18, 2025Reynolds filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni’s lawsuit, in which he is named as a co-defendant, alleging Baldoni’s lawsuit does not prove Reynolds defamed him and is instead “a list of grievances attempting to shame Mr. Reynolds

Favor,” where she received a warm reception from the crowd and spoke primarily about her work on the film, though co-star Anna Kendrick dodged a question that appeared to allude to Lively’s legal battle, and one protester held up a sign that said “Justice for Justin Baldoni” outside the theater.', 'March 6, 2025At a hearing Thursday, Lively’s attorneys argued certain information should be treated as highly classified “attorney’s eyes only” material, which lawyer Sigrid McCawley said would help minimize the risk of “irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands”—apparently suggesting messages between Lively and celebrity friends may leak. The judge did not rule on the request Thursday.', 'Though it’s unclear which “high profile individuals” McCawley was referring to, Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman has previously suggested he could request Lively’s friend Taylor Swift testify, after she appeared to be referred to in Baldoni’s lawsuit.', 'March 5, 2025The Los Angeles Times published an investigative report on Baldoni’s career, citing multiple unnamed employees at his Wayfarer Studios production company, some of whom said he injected “toxic positivity” and his Bahai faith into the workplace culture in a way that felt “professionally inappropriate.”', 'Representatives for Baldoni and Wayfarer told the Los Angeles Times there have “never been any reported complaints regarding the workplace culture” and Wayfarer’s work is rooted in “various faiths and backgrounds.”', 'March 4, 2025Lewis Liman, a U.S. district judge, said the New York Times’ motion to dismiss Justin Baldoni’s $400 million case against the newspaper provided “substantial grounds,” suggesting the lawsuit—in which Baldoni accused the Times of working with Lively’s team to smear him—could be dismissed.', 'Feb. 28, 2025Shapiro, who formerly served as the CIA’s deputy chief of staff between 2013 and 2015 before starting his own strategic consulting firm, will advise Lively’s litigation team on legal communications relating to the lawsuit she filed against Baldoni in New York federal court.', 'Feb. 20, 2025Attorneys submitted a letter on behalf of Lively and Reynolds asking a new, more extensive protective order be imposed that would shield “personal, sensitive or proprietary information” from the public after claiming they and their allies have been victimized since the legal battle began.

In a resurfaced interview from the 2022 Forbes Power Women\'s Summit, Lively said just following direction as an actress ""wasn\'t fulfilling for me"" and that she\'s received backlash for stepping in and trying to be part of costume design, writing and other aspects of a project. She said she\'s had writers, producers and directors ""welcome that and invite that,"" and others who resented her for stepping on toes. She also said she hasn’t always upfront with her plans to step in to other parts of a project when she was hired as an actress, and that she “wouldn\'t reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled...

""I f***ed up, that is a fail on my part,"" he appears to say. ""One thing you should know about me is that I am willing to apologize when I fail... I am a very flawed man, as my wife will attest."" Baldoni then appears to talk for almost another five minutes, in which he says there is “nothing more exciting to me” than working with Lively. The message does not specifically say which scene Baldoni is referring to but his lawsuit against Lively mentions tension over a rooftop scene in the film that Lively rewrote and presented to Baldoni as her own work before telling media outlets that her husband, Reynolds, actually wrote it.', 'Baldoni directed and co-starred with Lively in “It Ends With Us,” the movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling book of the same name, which released last August. Rumors of a rift developing between Lively and Baldoni during post-production began to emerge around the movie’s release, and were further fueled during the film\'s press tour when Lively appeared to avoid mention of Baldoni in interviews. Speculation emerged that there were disputes over creative control and sources told TMZ Baldoni had ""fat-shamed"" Lively by inquiring about her weight, telling an on-set trainer he wanted to avoid injury while lifting the actress in the movie. Baldoni and Lively were never photographed together while promoting “It Ends With Us.” As rumors of a feud grew, Baldoni hired Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR manager who represented Johnny Depp in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to texts published by The New York Times, Nathan suggested plans including “full social take downs” by creating “threads of theories” and planting pieces in the media of “how horrible Blake is to work with.” Lively said the alleged smear campaign had caused “severe emotional distress” for her and her family, prompting her to back out of hosting the “Saturday Night Live” season 50 premiere.', 'Lively\'s initial complaint included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails, which were the main focus of the Times article at the center of Baldoni\'s lawsuit. The text messages were largely between Baldoni, his publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis management expert Melissa Nathan, and were obtained through a civil subpoena, Lively\'s complaint said. A lawsuit filed by Baldoni\'s ex-publicist Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Jonesworks publicity firm, days later revealed she was the source of the text messages, which were obtained from Abel’s work phone. In her own lawsuit against Baldoni, Jones claimed Abel was fired for conspiring to steal clients from her firm and Jones later had Abel’s company-issued phone “forensically preserved and examined in detail.” Lively\'s team then obtained the texts through a subpoena against Jonesworks. The texts show discussions on how to coordinate a social media campaign against Lively, and how Baldoni wanted to feel like Lively ""can be buried” under negative media. The messages show the trio talking about the “shift on social” against Lively, and reveal that Baldoni was aware of the negative messaging against her. Messages from Baldoni also show him encouraging the P.R. team, flagging social media posts for them to use and, in one case, suggesting “flipping the narrative” on a positive story about Lively and Reynolds, according to The Times. In other messages, he reiterates that the campaign needs to be untraceable.', 'Around the time of the “It Ends With Us” premiere, Lively was the subject of intense criticism online targeting how she promoted the film, the opportune release of her haircare line and other behaviors. In one promotional video, Lively encourages the audience to ""grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see (the movie)."" Fans instantly criticized Lively\'s upbeat tone and claimed she was attempting to promote the movie as a lighthearted love story, cheapening the movie\'s serious take on domestic abuse. Comments on the video attacked Lively—""shame on you and your PR team for turning a blind eye,"" one said—but praised Baldoni for how he handled promotion. Lively was also criticized for seeming to promote her newly launched hair-care line, Blake Brown, off the back of the film, but it was later revealed that the two were never supposed to launch at the same time. Production delays caused by Hollywood strikes in 2023 pushed the premiere of “It Ends With Us,” then coinciding with the predetermined launch date of the brand. At the same time, Lively was freshly criticized for her reaction to an interviewer in a resurfaced 2016 clip. Lively’s lawsuits claim the public’s attacks were part of the smear campaign she says was orchestrated against her.', 'Breaking News Alerts: Get the latest news straight to your inbox as it happens.', '', '', '', 'A number of celebrities have come out to support Lively since she filed her initial complaint, including Hoover, Lively’s “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-stars and actress Amber Heard, who claimed to be a victim of a similar social media takedown.

America Ferrera, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn, who starred alongside Lively in her 2005 breakout role in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" slammed the “vindictive effort ensued to discredit her voice” and Heard said she has seen similar social media campaigns ""firsthand and up close,” calling it ""horrifying and destructive.” Actresses Kate Beckinsale and Abigail Breslin shared their own stories of harassment and retaliation in the wake of Lively\'s lawsuit, and director Paul Feig posted that Lively ""did not deserve any of this smear campaign.” Lively\'s ""It Ends with Us"" costar Brandon Sklenar posted a link to the initial New York Times story and Jenny Slate, another co-star in the film, said she stands by her ""loyal friend.""

While he declined to strike the exhibit from the docket, he said he would simply disregard it.', 'Liman granted the plaintiffs leave to amend only a narrow part of their case — allegations that Lively interfered with Apple and Sony’s promotional arrangements — but dismissed all other claims with prejudice, signaling that he found the broader legal theories fundamentally flawed.', 'Although an appeal remains possible, the ruling delivers a decisive and public defeat for Baldoni and Wayfarer in their attempt to reframe the fallout over the film.', 'Lively’s push to dismiss the lawsuit had drawn support from several advocacy groups, that argue that the case threatens hard-won legal protections for people who speak out about sexual harassment and misconduct.

Baldoni immediately denied Lively’s claims.', 'Lively eventually escalated her civil rights complaint, officially filing a lawsuit against Baldoni.', 'In a statement posted on her Instagram Story, Lively wrote that she was grateful for the support she’s received and said she is committed to continue advocating for women.', '“Like so many others, I’ve felt the pain of a retaliatory lawsuit, including the manufactured shame that tries to break us. While the suit against me was defeated, so many don’t have the resources to fight back,” she wrote. “I’m more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman’s right to have a voice in protecting themselves, including their safety, their integrity, their dignity and their story.”', 'Motions to dismiss Baldoni’s claims by Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, were all granted. The judge also granted a motion to dismiss by the New York Times.', 'Baldoni had sued the publication, who was the first to report on Lively’s allegations of sexual harassment, for $250 million for libel, claiming that the newspaper published an article “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” that relied on Lively’s “self-serving narrative.”', 'The judge ruled that Baldoni can file an amended complaint on the allegations of tortious interference with contract, relating to Reynolds and Lively, and breach of implied covenant, relating to Lively, by June 23, if they choose to do so.', 'In a statement, New York Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said, “We are grateful to the court for seeing the lawsuit for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting.”', '“Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism,” the statement added. “We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.”', 'CNN has reached out to representatives for Baldoni for comment.', 'The New York Times was the first to report – in an article titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” – that Lively had filed a complaint with Civil Rights Department about Baldoni’s alleged conduct on set of “It End With Us” and after production. Those complaints are typically confidential.', 'Lively alleged that after being sexually harassed with inappropriate comments and behavior on set, Baldoni’s team then orchestrated a smear campaign against her to ruin her reputation in the public sphere. Lively’s complaint contained hundreds of text messages between Baldoni and his crisis PR team, including one text that read they could “bury” her.', 'Baldoni’s production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath, Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, and members from Baldoni’s PR and crisis management team were all cited as plaintiffs on the suit against the Times.', 'The judge’s ruling on Monday did not address the merits of Baldoni’s complaint but rather held that Lively’s sexual harassment claims in her complaint were protected by law and could not form the basis of a defamation claim. He cited a piece of California legislation that came in response to the #MeToo movement.', 'He also wrote in his decision that the act of providing Lively’s complaint to the New York Times was not sufficient to constitute defamation “because the complaint is protected by the fair report privilege.”', 'In the months after Lively and Baldoni’s suits were filed, the legal battle has often played out in the public eye. In February, Baldoni’s team published a website containing texts and an alleged timeline relating to Lively’s claims. The website, a separate leaked voice note that Baldoni sent to Lively and several public statements made by Baldoni’s lawyer were the subject of several court hearings in recent months.', '“It Ends With Us” starred Lively and Baldoni as an on-screen couple and featured instances of domestic violence.', 'Rumors of their fractured professional relationship began percolating during the film’s 2024 press tour.', 'This story has been updated.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Justin Baldoni’s Defamation Suit Against Blake Lively Dismissed,https://www.vulture.com/article/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-lawsuit-dismissed.html,"['', 'Save this article to read it later.', '', 'Justin Baldoni’s $400 million defamation suit against Blake Lively was thrown out of court in a June 9 decision by Judge Lewis J. Liman. Baldoni had countersued Lively; Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds; and her publicist, Leslie Sloane, for libel over statements that Baldoni was a “sexual predator” or had committed “sexual assault.” Liman wrote that Baldoni did “not adequately allege” that any statements Lively made to the Times were false except the claims that are also in her harassment suit against Baldoni, which are protected by law. Sloane’s and Reynolds’s statements were found to be repeated versions of Lively’s story, “which they had no reason to doubt” and are therefore not defamation, per the decision. Baldoni is allowed to refile but only allegations regarding interference with contracts.', '“Last week, I stood proudly alongside 19 organizations united in defending women’s rights to speak up for their safety,” Lively, 37, wrote via her Instagram Story on Monday, June 9. “Like so many others, I’ve felt the pain of a retaliatory lawsuit, including the manufactured shame that tries to break us. While the suit against me was defeated, so many don’t have the resources to fight back. I’m more resolved than ever to continue to stand for every woman’s right to have a voice in protecting themselves, including their safety, their integrity, their dignity and their story.” Lively reportedly “cried with relief” after learning of the dismissal, a source told People. “She’s obviously relieved. They both are,” another source added. “She feels vindicated.”', 'Baldoni’s claim against the New York Times for defamation was also thrown out. Liman wrote that the Times is protected by fair-reporting privilege, a state-law defense that covers defamatory statements made in a court trial. New York State allows journalists to report on any “judicial proceeding, legislative proceeding, or other official proceeding,” without its being considered defamation. In December 2024, the Times published a report that Baldoni and his crisis-PR team, headed by Melissa Nathan, ran a “smear campaign” against Lively during It Ends With Us’s promotional run, based on Lively’s legal proceedings against Baldoni.', '“Today’s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane, and The New York Times,” Lively’s legal team said in a statement to Variety. “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million’ lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it.” Sloane’s lawyer added in a statement to People that “Leslie Sloane has consistently said that she never defamed Baldoni or the Wayfarer Parties and she was wrongfully dragged into this lawsuit because the Wayfarer Parties wanted to actively harm Sloane’s reputation. Today’s decision by the Court makes clear that Sloane did nothing wrong. Sloane stands fully vindicated, and justice has been served.”', 'On June 3, Liman had ruled against Lively’s emotional-distress charges against Baldoni, but the director still faces multiple other complaints, including allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation. The trial is currently scheduled for March 2026.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']",Entertainment,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNU9iVFpIYmtoSVEzQkJRbXROVFJDZkF4amlCU2dLTWdrTlVwckdvbWc5U1FJ=-w280-h168-p-df

It was logged days after the newspaper’s Pulitzer Prize-winning #MeToo journalist Megan Twohey published a story outlining her claims against Baldoni and Wayfarer, including how they weaponized social media to “astroturf” the actress around the time of the pic’s release in summer 2024.', '', 'The Times piece coincided with a complaint Lively filed just before Christmas with the California Civil Rights Commission. Days later, Lively formally lodged an almost identical complaint with federal court in New York, prompting Baldoni and Wayfarer to file their own countersuit action (the two cases were quickly combined).', '“Today’s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,” Lively’s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb said in a statement. “As we have said from day one, this $400 million lawsuit was a sham, and the court saw right through it.”', 'Judge Lewis J. Liman of the Southern District did, however, leave the door open for Wayfarer and Baldoni’s legal team, led by Bryan Freedman, to file an amended lawsuit relating to limited contractual obligations. He also denied a request that Freedman’s side be ordered to pay legal fees, albeit without prejudice.', '', 'That didn’t seem to deter Gottlieb and Hudson, who say they look forward to the next battle in court toward “seeking attorneys’ fees, treble damages and punitive damages” against Baldoni and Wayfarer’s billionaire partner and backer, Steve Sarowitz.', 'The Baldoni-Lively legal saga has gripped Hollywood for months. Liman’s 132-page ruling would seem to indicate it might be time for all to move on.', 'Among other key findings, Liman wrote, “Even if they turn out to be unneeded, an employee can insist on protections at workplace for sexual harassment without being accused of extortion. If an employer accedes, it cannot later claim to be a victim of the employee’s wrongful threats.”', 'He also returned again and again to the notion that Wayfarer somehow lost out on any money because it was Lively’s cut of the film — which grossed north of $350 million globally — that was released into the world. “Accepting the allegations, Wayfarer gave up on releasing its preferred version of the movie, a cut by Baldoni, in favor of a version that Lively preferred. But there is no allegation that Baldoni’s version of the movie was of greater value than Lively’s. For that independent reason, the Wayfarer Parties’ civil extortion claim related to the demands for creative control fails,” stated the ruling.', 'Freedman and Baldoni didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. They have repeatedly argued that Lively wrested control of the film, both from Wayfarer and distribution partner Sony, by threatening to not promote it unless she could cut her own version of the film.', '', '“The Wayfarer Parties cannot recover for Lively’s alleged actions to steal creative control of the film from Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties. Regardless of the propriety of these actions, they do not constitute civil extortion under California law,” Liman said in his ruling. “However, the Wayfarer Parties have not adequately alleged that Lively’s threats were wrongful extortion rather than legally permissible hard bargaining or renegotiation of working conditions. Additionally, the Wayfarer Parties have not shown that some of Lively’s allegedly extortionate acts damaged them. The Wayfarer Parties also cannot recover on their defamation claims. The Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements in her CRD complaint, which are privileged.”', 'And in regards to a hotly contested document Lively allegedly never signed assuring that she would promote the film, Liman wrote, “There also is no allegation that Lively had a contractual obligation to promote the film; if not, there is no basis to assume that the value that she conveyed in terms of her willingness to promote represented anything other than a fair trade for the Wayfarer Parties’ willingness to use her cut.”', 'Liman also suggested it wasn’t defamation for Reynolds to tell his agents at WME — which at the time represented Baldoni — that Baldoni was a sexual predator since he may have genuinely believed it was true with no malice intended. Baldoni was soon dropped from the agency; his contract with WME is one of the topics the judge would allow to be included in a limited amended filing.', '', 'In a statement following the ruling, a Times spokesperson added, “We are grateful to the court for seeing the lawsuit against The New York Times for what it was: a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting. Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism.

largely focused on abuse against women, a central theme of “It Ends With Us,” and revealed her mother was a victim of abuse.', 'April 13, 2025“It Ends With Us” storyboard artist Talia Spencer defended Baldoni in an interview with “60 Minutes Australia,” stating she felt Lively “smelled [Baldoni’s] kindness, mistook it for weakness and tried to take advantage and take power,” alleging Lively “tried

torso-covering prosthetic” and was not “nearly nude” as she had claimed in her complaint.', 'March 20, 2025In a counterclaim to Jones’ December lawsuit against Baldoni and Abel, Baldoni alleged Jones attempted to undermine Abel’s authority as a PR representative for Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company, claiming she suddenly terminated Abel from her PR firm, seized her phone and leaked texts to Lively’s team, which the lawsuit says was done in response to Abel voicing her intent to leave Jones’ firm and Jones’ fear she would take Baldoni as a client with her.', 'March 20,

battle, and one protester held up a sign that said “Justice for Justin Baldoni” outside the theater.', 'March 6, 2025At a hearing Thursday, Lively’s attorneys argued certain information should be treated as highly classified “attorney’s eyes only” material, which lawyer Sigrid McCawley said would help minimize the risk of “irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands”—apparently suggesting messages between Lively and celebrity friends may leak.

In a resurfaced interview from the 2022 Forbes Power Women\'s Summit, Lively said just following direction as an actress ""wasn\'t fulfilling for me"" and that she\'s received backlash for stepping in and trying to be part of costume design, writing and other aspects of a project. She said she\'s had writers, producers and directors ""welcome that and invite that,"" and others who resented her for stepping on toes. She also said she hasn’t always upfront with her plans to step in to other parts of a project when she was hired as an actress, and that she “wouldn\'t reveal that I actually need to have authorship in order to feel fulfilled... Sometimes that might have felt like a rug pull.”', 'Feb. 8, 2025Filmmaker Judd Apatow joked about ""It Ends With Us"" at the 77th Annual Directors Guild of America (DGA) Awards Saturday night, calling it ""such a terrible movie"" and referencing the Baldoni-Lively lawsuits.

Rumors of a rift developing between Lively and Baldoni during post-production began to emerge around the movie’s release, and were further fueled during the film\'s press tour when Lively appeared to avoid mention of Baldoni in interviews. Speculation emerged that there were disputes over creative control and sources told TMZ Baldoni had ""fat-shamed"" Lively by inquiring about her weight, telling an on-set trainer he wanted to avoid injury while lifting the actress in the movie. Baldoni and Lively were never photographed together while promoting “It Ends With Us.” As rumors of a feud grew, Baldoni hired Melissa Nathan, a crisis PR manager who represented Johnny Depp in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. According to texts published by The New York Times, Nathan suggested plans including “full social take downs” by creating “threads of theories” and planting pieces in the media of “how horrible Blake is to work with.” Lively said the alleged smear campaign had caused “severe emotional distress” for her and her family, prompting her to back out of hosting the “Saturday Night Live” season 50 premiere.', 'Lively\'s initial complaint included excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails, which were the main focus of the Times article at the center of Baldoni\'s lawsuit. The text messages were largely between Baldoni, his publicist Jennifer Abel and crisis management expert Melissa Nathan, and were obtained through a civil subpoena, Lively\'s complaint said. A lawsuit filed by Baldoni\'s ex-publicist Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Jonesworks publicity firm, days later revealed she was the source of the text messages, which were obtained from Abel’s work phone. In her own lawsuit against Baldoni, Jones claimed Abel was fired for conspiring to steal clients from her firm and Jones later had Abel’s company-issued phone “forensically preserved and examined in detail.” Lively\'s team then obtained the texts through a subpoena against Jonesworks. The texts show discussions on how to coordinate a social media campaign against Lively, and how Baldoni wanted to feel like Lively ""can be buried” under negative media. The messages show the trio talking about the “shift on social” against Lively, and reveal that Baldoni was aware of the negative messaging against her. Messages from Baldoni also show him encouraging the P.R. team, flagging social media posts for them to use and, in one case, suggesting “flipping the narrative” on a positive story about Lively and Reynolds, according to The Times. In other messages, he reiterates that the campaign needs to be untraceable.', 'Around the time of the “It Ends With Us” premiere, Lively was the subject of intense criticism online targeting how she promoted the film, the opportune release of her haircare line and other behaviors. In one promotional video, Lively encourages the audience to ""grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see (the movie)."" Fans instantly criticized Lively\'s upbeat tone and claimed she was attempting to promote the movie as a lighthearted love story, cheapening the movie\'s serious take on domestic abuse. Comments on the video attacked Lively—""shame on you and your PR team for turning a blind eye,"" one said—but praised Baldoni for how he handled promotion. Lively was also criticized for seeming to promote her newly launched hair-care line, Blake Brown, off the back of the film, but it was later revealed that the two were never supposed to launch at the same time. Production delays caused by Hollywood strikes in 2023 pushed the premiere of “It Ends With Us,” then coinciding with the predetermined launch date of the brand. At the same time, Lively was freshly criticized for her reaction to an interviewer in a resurfaced 2016 clip. Lively’s lawsuits claim the public’s attacks were part of the smear campaign she says was orchestrated against her.', 'Breaking News Alerts: Get the latest news straight to your inbox as it happens.', '', '', '', 'A number of celebrities have come out to support Lively since she filed her initial complaint, including Hoover, Lively’s “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-stars and actress Amber Heard, who claimed to be a victim of a similar social media takedown. Hoover, who The Times reported also refused to do press with Baldoni, posted to Instagram after Lively first made her allegations to call her ""nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient."" America Ferrera, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn, who starred alongside Lively in her 2005 breakout role in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" slammed the “vindictive effort ensued to discredit her voice” and Heard said she has seen similar social media campaigns ""firsthand and up close,” calling it ""horrifying and destructive.” Actresses Kate Beckinsale and Abigail Breslin shared their own stories of harassment and retaliation in the wake of Lively\'s lawsuit, and director Paul Feig posted that Lively ""did not deserve any of this smear campaign.” Lively\'s ""It Ends with Us"" costar Brandon Sklenar posted a link to the initial New York Times story and Jenny Slate, another co-star in the film, said she stands by her ""loyal friend."" Amy Schumer posted a story on Instagram that said, “I believe Blake.” Political influencer Candace Owens posted in support of Baldoni after he was stripped of his Vital Voices award, writing that he should ""have his day in court"" before such drastic measures are taken.', 'One Community.
