"I found a free iPhone 16 deal that doesn't require a trade-in (and applies to Pro models, too)",https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-found-a-free-iphone-16-deal-that-doesnt-require-a-trade-in-and-applies-to-pro-models-too/,"['', '', '', '', 'It may sound unbelievable, but Boost Mobile is offering nearly every iPhone 16 model at essentially no upfront cost and with no trade-in required. With its ""Infinite Access"" deal, you also get unlimited talk, text, and data for just $65 per month. ', ""Also: T-Mobile will sell you an iPhone 16 Pro for free with no trade-in - here's how you can get one"", ""This offer is available to both new and existing Boost customers. In fact, existing subscribers can upgrade easily in the Boost app without opening a new account. Here's all the fine print you need to know."", 'You\'ve probably seen other carriers offering ""free"" iPhones, but before you dismiss this deal, there are reasons why it stands out.', ""First, Boost's offer covers the entire iPhone 16 lineup: the base iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. While traditional carrier plans often require trading in a phone to qualify for discounts, Boost waives that requirement entirely."", ""Second, Boost will cover up to $1,000 of the list price. When you sign up, you'll pay the required sales tax on your chosen model plus your first month of service. You must enroll in Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for iPhone plan to get this deal. It bundles unlimited talk, text, and data (on a 5G-capable network) and includes 30 GB of premium data."", ""Also: Verizon will give you almost any phone for free with just one trade-in required - here's how"", ""Infinite Access costs $65 per month for a single line -- but the first month is credited back on your next Boost bill. So your real out-of-pocket cost is just the sales tax. For example, if you choose an iPhone 16 Pro (list price $999.99), you might pay roughly $80 to $100 in sales tax (depending on your state) plus $65 in service, which you'll see credited on your following bill."", ""You simply complete a soft credit check (which won't affect your credit score) and start the plan. There's no activation fee, no administrative fee—just the standard taxes and local surcharges. Boost's pricing is straightforward: if the checkout page shows $65 for your first month (with the device credit to follow), that's what you'll pay, aside from sales tax on the phone."", ""There's no multi-line requirement. One line is all you need."", ""Each model is available in its base configuration. If you choose extra storage, the monthly device payment increases proportionally -- you'll see the precise breakdown before checkout."", ""Boost said it spreads device payments over 36 months, but you're not locked into a separate service contract and can cancel your service at any time. If you do cancel early, however, you'll owe the remaining device balance."", ""Also: You can still trade in any phone at Verizon to get an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch free. Here's how"", ""After 12 consecutive monthly payments, you're eligible for an annual upgrade. So, when the next iPhone model launches (e.g., the iPhone 17), you can request the upgrade through the Boost Mobile app. Boost will ship you the new phone at no additional cost and even sends a pre-paid box for your old device. Once it receives and inspects it, you'll continue the same $65-per-month plan with the new model. If you'd rather skip the upgrade, the 36-month finance schedule continues until you fully own the phone."", ""Most major carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) require four lines at $85 to $100 per line, trade-ins, and additional activation fees (usually $35 per line). Boost's offer is $65 per month for a single line, with zero activation fees and no trade-ins. Over a year, Boost claims you'd save around $420 compared to T-Mobile, $360 compared to Verizon, and $311 compared to AT&T. Those savings assume you're comparing a single-line plan with equivalent data allowances and factoring in typical trade-in requirements."", ""Also: I replaced my iPhone 16 Pro with the 16e for a month - here's my buying advice now"", ""If you're curious about Boost's network coverage, the service uses a cloud-based 5G network and claims to offer roughly 99 percent nationwide coverage -- so performance should match what you'd get from other carriers."", 'Boost Mobile\'s Infinite Access deal is honestly one of the cheapest ways to get the latest iPhone 16 lineup without trading in your current device or paying big upfront fees. Boost even provides free ""store-to-door"" setup with this deal. That\'s where you get to choose a two-hour delivery window, and a technician will come and help set up and activate your phone in person. Neat, right?', 'Looking for the next best product?

"T-Mobile review: Packed with perks, but is it worth the price?",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/t-mobile-review,"[""It's hard to go wrong with T-Mobile. It offers some of the best cell phone plans and value among the big three carriers in the US. Admittedly, more so if you're taking out multiple lines."", 'Like AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile is an ideal option for multi-line plans thanks to its multi-line discounts, especially those with three or more lines.', ""Those with fewer lines can still enjoy T-Mobile and all its benefits, like in-person customer support at physical locations, and depending on the plan, comprehensive international features and discounts on popular streaming services. However, we'd recommend that single or dual-line accounts consider mobile-virtual-network-operator (MVNO) options, which are significantly less expensive than T-Mobile's plans, and dominate our cheap cell phone plans guide."", ""The only way you could go wrong is if you pick T-Mobile in an area with weak coverage. This isn't a dig at T-Mobile's coverage; the same word of caution applies to all carriers, as they all have varying coverage in different parts of the country."", ""With that said, T-Mobile has one major drawback relative to other major carriers that bears consideration — it doesn't let you mix-and-match plans (picking different plans for different lines). That could lead to unnecessarily higher monthly plan costs if other users in your account have different needs."", 'T-Mobile has three main postpaid plans — the basic Essentials (including the Essentials Saver plan), the mid-range Experience More, and the high-end Experience Beyond plans.', ""The Essentials plan offers T-Mobile's best value with all the data most people need, even if the network may temporarily become artificially slower when it is congested (more on that in the coverage and data speeds section below)."", ""However, T-Mobile's Essentials plan lacks additional features found in the Experience plan that some may need, like high-speed mobile hotspot, satellite messaging when you're out of coverage areas, and extended international features. Experience plans also include discounts on popular streaming services and smartwatch or tablet plans, which are nice bonuses. You can get included Apple TV+ and ad-supported Netflix subscriptions on Experience More, and the Experience Beyond tier also throws in ad-supported Hulu."", 'Prices are guaranteed for five years on both Experience plans as well.', ""Other benefits on all three tiers include free in-flight WiFi, free months of service to SiriusXM and Pandora Streaming, and an MLS season pass (offers rotate regularly). Plus, there's T-Mobile Tuesdays to regularly mix things up by providing free Slurpees, pizza, $5 movie tickets, discounted fuel, cashback at restaurants, and more."", ""If you've been reconsidering your home internet options lately, you'll get extra savings on T-Mobile's internet packages if you're on one of these plans. We're testing one of their 5G home internet plans right now and will have a review soon - it's pretty impressive so far."", ""You can find plan details on T-Mobile's website, and we've included them below for your convenience:"", 'Beta included until July 2025', '$10 per month optional extra', 'Beta included until July 2025', '$10 per month optional extra', 'Discounted to $5/month per line', 'Max savings of $22/month', 'Free Apple TV Plus and Netflix Standard with ads', 'Savings with both subscriptions: $17.98/month', 'Free Apple TV Plus, Netflix Standard with ads, Hulu with ads', 'Max savings of: $27.97/month', 'In Canada and Mexico: Unlimited talk, text, 128Kbps data (essentially unusably slow)', 'Abroad: Unlimited texting in 215+ countries and destinations', 'In Canada and Mexico: Unlimited talk, text, 15GB high-speed data', 'Abroad: Unlimited text, 5GB high-speed data in 215+ countries and destinations', 'Full flight texting and WiFi with streaming where available (mostly domestic US flights)', 'In Canada and Mexico: Unlimited talk, text, 30GB high-speed data', 'Abroad: Unlimited text, 15GB high-speed data in 215+ countries and destinations', 'Full flight texting and WiFi with streaming where available (mostly domestic US flights)', 'At the time of writing, T-Mobile also has a limited-time promotion for its plans where you can get a third line free (the same price as two lines).

These promotions are outrageously good value for families or friend groups with three or more lines.', ""T-Mobile's Experience More plan is an excellent for most people with good T-Mobile coverage, as it comes with unlimited premium data, a generous 60GB of mobile hotspot data, tempting discounts on popular streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus, and comprehensive international features."", 'No mix-and-match plans with T-Mobile', ""Unlike other carriers, T-Mobile doesn't let you add differing plans under one multi-line account — every line in the account must have the same plan."", ""That inflexibility can be somewhat mitigated by T-Mobile's 3rd-line-free promotion, but all the users in an account are still beholden to the cost of the highest-tier plan in the account."", 'For example, if one person in an account needs the Experience Beyond plan, but the others only need the Essentials plan, everyone has to get the Experience Beyond plan and pay more than they would if they could mix and match plans.', 'When it makes sense to get the Essentials plan', 'When it makes sense to upgrade to the Experience More plan', 'When it makes sense to get the Experience Beyond plan', ""Don't upgrade to an Experience plan just for the streaming service and watch/tablet line discounts"", 'The maximum savings from the streaming service discounts on the Experience More plan is around $18, and up to $28 on the Experience Beyond plan.', 'Even with all the discounts on the Experience Beyond plan combined, including streaming services and watch/tablet lines, the maximum savings amount to $50.', ""Those discounts won't offset the added cost of the Experience plans if all you need is the Essentials plan. They are nice benefits if you also need the core features included in the Experience plans that aren't included in the Essentials plan, like fast (usable) hotspot data and extended international features."", 'T-Mobile offers the plans with discounts for members of the military and veterans, first responders, and customers aged 55 or older.', ""T-Mobile also offers prepaid plans, but they are poor value compared to mobile-virtual-network-operator (MVNO) options, many of which run on T-Mobile's network. MVNOs tend to offer the same amount or more data than T-Mobile's prepaid plans for lower monthly costs. The first MVNO alternative to T-Mobile's prepaid plans that comes to mind is Mint Mobile, which T-Mobile purchased back in 2024, and tops our list in our guide for the best cheap cell phone plans."", 'T-Mobile has typically excellent coverage in many urban and suburban areas, and its rural coverage is expanding quickly. It can even serve certain areas better than other major carriers. To be sure, the opposite can be true for other areas.', ""I can't say whether T-Mobile's coverage works for you and your area, and while T-Mobile's coverage map can give you an idea, no carrier coverage map is truly accurate."", 'The best way to determine if T-Mobile works well in your area is to ask local friends, family, and neighbors. You can also check local groups on social media channels, like Facebook and Nextdoor.com.', ""If someone says T-Mobile's coverage isn't good, ask which carrier works for them. You might find that no carrier works well in that area, as is the case around my home. I fully realize the irony that someone writing a carrier review has poor coverage from every major carrier. Don't worry, I venture out to various spots in and out of town to test signal strength and data speeds."", 'T-Mobile advertises data speeds between 79 and 357 Mbps on its Essentials plans, and between 89 and 418 Mbps on its Beyond plans. Our speed tests varied wildly, regardless of plans — as high as 902 Mbps in busy parts of town, to as low as 0.97 Mbps in leafy residential areas not too far away from the busy section. Interestingly, I saw fast speeds up to 303 Mbps in sparsely populated ""back-country"" parts of my area.', 'To be sure, T-Mobile data speeds will differ nationwide, and even in different parts of my town.', 'Data speed differences between the two plans', 'Unlike data speeds in my test areas, the difference in data speeds between the Essentials plan and the Experience Beyond plan can be translated to almost anyone across the country.', ""T-Mobile's website has a fine-print clause beneath its plan offerings stating that the Essentials plan may deliver slower data speeds than higher-tier plans. My tests confirm that this is true."", ""Still, while measurable, the difference in data download speeds isn't dramatic — the Essentials plan recorded 19% slower speeds on average than the Experience Beyond plan across 31 tests in various parts of town, including busy commercial areas, residential zones, parks, and backcountry."", 'To put that into perspective, the average download speed on the Essentials plan was 220 Mbps in my tests, and 263 Mbps on the Experience Beyond plan. Both speeds are easily fast enough for most people, and the experience of using apps was identical on both the Essentials and Experience Beyond plans, whether I was in an area with slow or fast speeds.', ""This means that those leaning toward the more affordable Essentials plan shouldn't be concerned about slower speeds or a meaningfully different experience compared to the higher-tier plans."", 'Additionally, the fastest speed test we recorded was 902 Mbps on the Essentials plan. The fastest speed test recorded on the Experience Beyond plan was 856 Mbps.', ""Like most major carriers in the US, T-Mobile has tempting deals for new phones. Deals differ for different phones, so you'll need to check the specific deals for the one you'd like."", ""Still, it's possible to get even a high-end $1,000 iPhone 16 Pro for free with various condition combinations, like trading in a phone, signing up for a specific plan, or switching to T-Mobile from a different carrier. The trade-in value of your old phone depends on its generational age. For example, an iPhone 13 has a higher trade-in value than the iPhone 12."", ""There are deals with varying conditions for almost every phone on T-Mobile, many get you a new phone for free, and some aren't even dependent on signing up for a pricey high-end plan. You generally get a better deal when signing up for higher-tier plans."", ""The overarching phone deal condition with T-Mobile is that you must keep the phone for 24 months (two years) before you can upgrade to a new one. The exception is the Experience Beyond plan, which lets you upgrade yearly. At these times, you'll also have access to the same deals as new customers."", ""To be sure, T-Mobile offers a shorter window before you can upgrade phones than Verizon and AT&T, which don't let you upgrade for 36 months (or three years)."", ""T-Mobile's plans propose some of the best value among major carriers, especially the Essentials and Experience More plans. As with most major carriers, you get better value with more lines on your account, generally around three or more lines."", 'We recommend that those with less than three lines look at MVNOs, including Mint Mobile, which T-Mobile acquired. MVNO options often have similar features and data as the basic postpaid plans from major carriers for a lower monthly bill. For more information, take a look at our roundups of the latest Mint Mobile plans and Visible mobile deals.', ""Still, T-Mobile's physical locations are a major benefit. They can offer superior in-person support than the phone and online-based support MVNOs offer. If you'd rather go to a physical location for anything related to your cell service, whether setting up your plan on your phone or troubleshooting an issue, you'll be better off with T-Mobile."", ""Only rule out T-Mobile if you find it has poor coverage in your area. After all, value doesn't matter if you can't use the service."", 'T-Mobile’s Essentials and Essentials Saver plans constitute the most affordable premium plans among the major carriers. It’s a downright bargain with four or five lines on a single plan and includes 50GB of premium monthly data per line before T-Mobile slows down your data speeds. Just note that Essentials users may experience slower speeds than higher-paying T-Mobile customers during heavy network congestion.', '', 'You can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.
