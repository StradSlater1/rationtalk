The British government threatened sanctions over the aid effort, the inaugural leader exited after complaining of limited autonomy, and a marquee consulting group backed out amid reports of dozens of Palestinians killed near the distribution sites.', 'Meanwhile, media coverage of the crises has ignited criticism and at least one major correction, to a Washington Post story that initially repeated Hamas’ claim that Israel was responsible for the killings.', 'Israel said the new effort, which launched amid warnings of widespread food shortages, was designed to ensure that Hamas terrorists would not seize supplies. But the rollout has been marred by chaos, drawing a barrage of criticism from international humanitarian groups that say its activities fall far short of meeting the massive need for food in Gaza and force residents to walk long distances across dangerous territory.', 'That criticism intensified after Hamas-affiliated health officials and the Red Cross reported that more than 20 people were killed at the distribution centers on Sunday and again on Tuesday. In response, the foundation, which is run by American contractors and secured by the Israeli military, said it would suspend aid distribution on Wednesday and part of Thursday.', 'The previous week, Boston Consulting Group, which had partnered pro-bono on the foundation’s work, said it would pull out and announced a review of its work in Gaza, according to the Wall Street Journal. (Nearly half a century ago, before he formally entered politics, Netanyahu worked as a consultant for BCG.)', 'The group’s exit came as the inaugural director, a U.S. military veteran named Jake Wood, resigned just hours before the first site was set to open, saying that Israel retained more control than he expected. This week, He was replaced by Johnnie Moore, an evangelical Christian public relations executive and ally of U.S. President Donald Trump who takes partial credit for Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in 2018.', 'On his Linkedin profile, Moore describes himself as “a bridge builder and peacemaker especially known for consequential work at the intersection of faith and foreign policy, especially in the Middle East.”', 'He assumes the role amid mass confusion about violence at the distribution sites, where Hamas said dozens were killed in multiple incidents.', 'Israel initially denied killing anyone at the sites. Late Tuesday night, a military spokesperson said the IDF has not fired within the distribution areas but did fire warning shots nearby on Tuesday, and would investigate “any incident that requires review.” The spokesperson blamed Hamas for trying to “sabotage” the aid distribution and said the military would “do whatever is necessary to ensure that the aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas.”', '“According to initial findings, the IDF did not fire at civilians within the aid distribution centers. Any claims to the contrary are entirely false, harm our forces and serve Hamas propaganda,” said the spokesperson, Effie Defrin. “Earlier today, IDF forces carried out warning fire approximately half a kilometer from the aid distribution center, targeting a few individuals who were approaching in a way that posed the security threat. We are not preventing Gaza residents from accessing the a distribution sites.”', 'But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that his country had halted negotiations over a free trade agreement with Israel, and may apply sanctions to the country, in protest of the aid crisis and other Israeli activity, which he called “appalling and in my view counterproductive and intolerable.”', 'He added, speaking in the House of Commons, “We have strongly opposed the expansion of military operations and settler violence, and the blocking of humanitarian aid. … We will keep looking at further actions along with our allies, including sanctions.”', 'The United Nations secretary general also condemned the killings and called for an investigation.

Security Council resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire.', 'The competing claims over carnage at the sites have rippled out into another controversy, as Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, accused the BBC of “tak[ing] the word of Hamas with total truth” regarding the fatalities, and then retracting its reporting — though she also said the administration was examining the claims.', 'Israel’s Foreign Ministry shared a clip of Leavitt’s remarks on X Tuesday, adding, “Maybe the @BBC should stop spreading fake news to vilify Israel.”', 'The BBC defended its coverage on Wednesday, acknowledging that it had updated estimates of the number killed on Sunday in its headline but that it had not retracted any article.', '“The claim the BBC took down a story after reviewing footage is completely wrong. We did not remove any story and we stand by our journalism,” the British network’s statement said.', 'But another outlet, The Washington Post, posted on X that it had corrected an article and deleted a tweet from Sunday that, it said, did not give appropriate weight to Israeli claims.

An additional 500 are wounded. Following the series of deadly attacks, the shadowy U.S.-Israeli humanitarian aid operation is shutting down for a day, and Israel’s military warned Palestinians that roads leading to the aid distribution centers will be considered “combat zones.” The United Nations has called for a prompt and impartial investigation into each of the attacks. The U.S.-Israeli aid system is “more about the humiliation and the control of the people” than feeding Palestinians, says Mahmoud Alsaqqa, Oxfam’s food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza, who joins us from Gaza City.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks over the past day have killed at least 95 Palestinians and injured 440 others. At least 18 of the dead are in Khan Younis following an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians.', 'Meanwhile, the new shadowy U.S.-, Israeli-backed aid operation has suspended aid distribution for a day to address what it called, quote, “renovation, reorganization and efficiency improvement work,” unquote. This comes after Palestinian officials accused Israel of repeatedly attacking Palestinians headed to the aid sites. The attacks killed 102 people, left nearly 500 others wounded.', 'The dead included a mother named Reem Zaidan, who was shot while waiting for aid in western Rafah. On Tuesday, her children and other mourners gathered for her funeral procession in Khan Younis. This is Reem Zaidan’s 16-year-old daughter Tahrir.', 'TAHRIR ZAIDAN: [translated] In the highest paradise, mom — we’ll see her in the highest paradise, God willing. … She put on her abaya and veil, took a sack of flour and a bag with her, hoping to fill them with canned food. For five days, she’s been going for nothing.', 'AMY GOODMAN: And this is Reem Zaidan’s 15-year-old son Ahmed describing how his mother was fatally shot while trying to get aid.', 'AHMED ZAIDAN: [translated] We haven’t eaten in two months. Everything has been under siege. Of course, we were going to go get aid. Today, my mother was telling my brother, “Lean over. Lower your head. Do what I’m doing.” My brother turned his head. Then a bullet went into her head.', 'AMY GOODMAN: We go now to Gaza City, where we’re joined by Mahmoud Alsaqqa, the Oxfam food security and livelihoods coordinator in Gaza.', 'Welcome back to Democracy Now! In a moment, we’re going to be going to the ship that’s trying to make its way to challenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza. We’ll be speaking with the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. But can you, Mahmoud, tell us what’s happening on the ground and the latest with this closing of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation set up by Israel, backed by the U.S., that took over the, what, three or four sites — it built them — instead of the 400 that were on the ground around Gaza?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for having me again.', 'In fact, the situation on the ground is extremely chaotic. And it’s as we have warned before about this, especially with this aid distribution mechanism. In fact, what is happening in these new militarized distribution points, it’s more about the humiliation and the control of the people. We are seeing the people — thousands of people are standing from the early hours in the morning to secure something to their starving children. And in such cases, it’s rare even to get actually the supplies. And now they are facing the issue of returning home alive. So, we are considering these points as death traps, and we are seeing shooting of starving people near to these sites, especially what’s happened in Rafah, as per your reporting, deaths. It’s horrifying, and many people have lost their lives in these sites.', 'So, these sites are controlled by private actors. It’s located in military zones, in military conflict areas. So, they didn’t even consider any things related to that, to the human beings and dignity. And what was exposed — expected to have from these sites is contradicts again and nothing achieved in terms of addressing the high and the overwhelming needs of the people here in Gaza.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mahmoud, the other organizations, aid organizations, that have been on the ground since this conflict began, has the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had any kind of communication or coordination with the existing groups?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: No, no. You know, our position from the first, that we were against such a mechanism, because we have the system in place. We have the system of the U.N. and the international NGOs that exist in place and which has proven its effectiveness since the 19 months, and even the improvement was noticed during the ceasefire period, where we were able to reach more and more vulnerable people. And this is vulnerable people who are not accessing even this distribution — the new GHO distribution points. And we have this multisectoral assistance. What we are having now in these distribution points is just food, and the people in need for a multisectoral assistance that we were even and we were trying to provide, this including the medical supplies, the clean water, shelter materials and all these things. And these things are now ignored within this mechanism. And we are trying all the time to abide to the international humanitarian law and to preserving the dignity of those people, which is — this mechanism strips the people of dignity, and this is why we are seeing all this humiliation of the people.', 'In summary, this mechanism is dehumanizing the people, and it’s really dangerous. People are losing their lives there. And it’s ineffective in reaching the people, especially the vulnerable people. And we have our mechanism in place and active, so there’s no need even for this mechanism at all.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And is Israel allowing any supplies in for the existing mechanism of aid groups in Gaza?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah, as you know, after the international community pressure on Israel after 12 weeks of a full blockade, on the 21st of March, they allowed a trickle of aid to come in. But it still have this over control on this aid that are coming, and it’s very limited quantities that are coming. And even it’s limited for food supplies and some nutrition items, where the need is much more than this. On average, what we are receiving in Gaza Strip right now in this mechanism is around 50 trucks, 60 trucks, or even less, more. But it’s nothing compared to what we should have, and it’s not addressing the huge needs of the people here in the Gaza Strip.', 'So, even with these mechanisms, we are still seeing this happening, and the people are starving. And this is the question, that: Where is the problem? The problem is with this mechanism, is that it’s not efficient or effective. We need to have a smooth supply of the aid in order to be able to provide the services. And we succeeded in doing so in a previous period of time.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, the U.N. Children’s Fund, UNICEF, has reported that the number of Gaza’s children killed or injured by Israel since October 2023 has surpassed 50,000. In a statement, UNICEF wrote, “How many more dead girls and boys will it take? What level of horror must be livestreamed before the international community fully steps up, uses its influence, and takes bold, decisive action to force the end of this ruthless killing of children?” As we speak, people in London are forming a red line. They’re holding red banners fully around the British Parliament. While Britain and France and Canada have said they’re going to crack down on relations with Israel, these people are demanding that they stop arming Israel. Can you talk about what’s happening with the children on the ground at this point?', 'MAHMOUD ALSAQQA: Yeah, the situation is deteriorating over time, especially with the vulnerable groups, including the children, you know? And according to the last food security and nutrition report, that we are expecting more worsening in the health of children, who are more affected by this shortages of all supplies in the Gaza Strip. And this is increasing, because we are seeing more displacement orders are in place, more intensifying of the military operations, and more displacement for the people to crowded people, so — to crowded places, so we are seeing the outbreak of diseases. And the health from — the health, public health, is deteriorating, and the health sector is collapsing, so we are expecting worse for the vulnerable groups, including the children.', 'So, this is why we have to save lives. We must go back to our work, reopening all the crossings, and lift the movement and the fuel restrictions for the people. And what we are seeing around the world nowadays, it’s really important and should be continued in order to hold Israel accountable to their — what they are doing right now, and also to reach this permanent ceasefire. Nowadays we are talking about permanent ceasefire, when we do not need a proposal to have such a few days and return back to the same area. We need a permanent ceasefire, so the people can breathe again and at least to have — to be able to recover from all these things that they are encountering and facing right now.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Alsaqqa, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Oxfam’s food security and livelihoods coordinator, speaking to us from Gaza.', 'When we come back, we go to the high seas to Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who’s attempting to sail to Gaza with about a dozen other people on a humanitarian aid boat organized by the Freedom Flotilla.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the US and Israeli-backed aid initiative that runs the site, said that Israeli forces were operating in the area during the same period.', 'Multiple videos geolocated by CNN place the gunfire near a roundabout where hundreds of Palestinians had gathered about half a mile (800 meters) away from the militarized aid site in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah. The designated route to the site along the coast, Al-Rasheed Street, is in an area under the Israeli military’s control and Israeli troops operate at a base nearby.', 'Weapons experts said the rate of gunfire heard in the footage, as well as images of bullets retrieved from victims, were consistent with machine guns used by the Israeli military that can be mounted on tanks. Multiple eyewitnesses said that they saw gunfire emanating from Israeli tanks nearby.', 'None of the videos definitively show who fired shots outside of the aid camp. However, CNN’s review of audiovisual material sheds fresh light on how the pursuit of aid turned chaotic and then dangerous, on the actions of Israeli forces and the consequences of the new aid mechanism, which has been mired in controversy.', 'The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially said on Sunday that its forces did not fire at civilians “while they were near or within the aid site.” An Israeli military source later acknowledged that troops had fired “warning shots” at suspects about 1 kilometer (1,093 yards) away.', 'The Israeli military declined to answer questions about CNN’s findings.', 'During a press conference on Tuesday, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said the military investigated and found its troops played no role in any mass casualty event. Defrin said: “This week, it was claimed that the IDF fired at civilians in an aid distribution area. This report is entirely false and echoes the propaganda of the terrorist organization Hamas… Regarding the incident on Sunday – it simply didn’t happen!”', 'Defrin also suggested casualty figures provided by the Palestinian health ministry were inflated, but did not elaborate as to how many people the military believed had been killed or injured.', 'Sunday’s mass shooting, which the Palestinian health ministry said killed at least 31 Palestinians and injured dozens, was the deadliest incident involving aid distribution in recent months. It comes amid warnings from the United Nations that the new aid distribution mechanism has become a “death trap” for desperate people seeking food in the strip.', 'Thousands of starving Palestinians had gathered in the sandy bulldozed area near the GHF-run site before the gates opened on Sunday, braving chaotic scenes when gunfire struck the crowd.', '“No one move, stay in your place… no one move!” one Palestinian man is heard yelling in a series of videos posted to TikTok on Sunday, filmed along the coast where crowds had gathered near the aid site.', 'The videos – reviewed and geolocated by CNN – capture Palestinians taking cover amid repeated bursts of gunfire, and what appear to be two explosive munitions seen landing next to the crowd.', 'Mohammed Saqer, 43, told CNN in an interview that he only narrowly escaped death, watching people around him get shot in the head as he crouched on the ground, hoping to survive long enough to reach the site run by GHF and get food for his family.', 'After the US-backed private foundation finally opened the site at 5:00 a.m., witnesses said the Israeli military’s gunfire continued nearby. Surveillance footage shared by GHF shows crowds of onrushing Palestinians scrambling to reach the limited boxes of food as tracer fire explodes into the night sky in the distance.', 'By sunrise, the extent of the catastrophe was undeniable. Videos captured bloodied bodies of Palestinians scattered across the sands, roughly a half mile from the food distribution center.', 'Similar deadly incidents on Monday and Tuesday near the same site have raised further questions about whether the militarized aid initiative backed by the US and approved by Israel can deliver food supplies safely. In the subsequent episodes, the IDF acknowledged that Israeli troops had fired warning shots in the area. GHF said none of the shootings occurred within or adjacent to their distribution sites, adding that the location of the shootings was “an area well beyond our secure distribution site.”', 'For Saqer, who said he managed to finally reach the aid site and escaped with whatever he could carry, the harrowing night still weighs heavily on him.', '“We survived a night that was worse than we could imagine,” he said. “The reality for people was one of death and hunger searching for food.”', 'When GHF announced its distribution plans for Sunday, the instructions were direct: only one aid site would be open starting at 5:00 a.m., and the IDF would be present in the area to secure passage on a designated route.', 'It also warned – albeit after gunfire reportedly already erupted – that the Israeli military would be “active” in the area ahead of the site’s opening.', '“Using the passage before 5:00 a.m. is prohibited, as we were informed by the military that it will be active in the area before and after the specified safe hours,” the GHF said in a release on Facebook at 4 a.m. “We remind all residents to stay on the road — straying from it poses a significant danger.”', 'Having endured an 11-week Israeli blockade of humanitarian aid, thousands of desperate Palestinians began making their way down Al-Rasheed Street in hopes of being among the first to reach the aid site – the only one operating in all of Gaza that day – before the limited supplies ran out.', 'As people attempted to slowly advance to the aid site from the Al-Alam roundabout, more than a dozen witnesses interviewed by CNN described the IDF opening volleys of intense fire on the crowd starting as early as 3:30 a.m.', '“I could hear the screams of young people and others from their injuries,” Saqer said. “In front of me were four young men with direct injuries to the head… there was a person next to me who was injured by a bullet in his eye.”', 'He and others said a quadcopter drone appeared above the crowd, with the voice on its speaker telling people to turn around. But amid the warning, gunfire crackled all around them.', '“Even retreating was almost impossible, and everyone was lying on the ground unable to lift their heads because if you lifted your head, you would get shot.”', 'As the chaos unfolded near the Al-Alam area, the GHF aid site officially opened at 5:00 a.m. Security video of the location released by the organization, which was labeled as beginning at 5:02 a.m., shows crowds of Palestinians running into the fenced distribution center.', 'Three minutes later, in the background of the video, bursts of tracer gunfire are seen overhead, which forensics experts told CNN appear to be outgoing from an area near the distribution site. In the video, which has no audio, crowds can be seen running in another direction nearby. It is unclear whether they are running from gunfire.', 'Around the same time back in the Al-Alam area approximately 800 meters (874 yards) away, 30-year-old Ameen Khalifa was filming as he took cover. Several videos shared on TikTok by Khalifa show groups of Palestinians lying flat on the ground and taking cover from ongoing bursts of automatic gunfire. CNN geolocated the video to the area using visible spotlights at the Egyptian border and the unfinished hospital that became an Israeli military base.', 'Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined the footage for CNN and said that the bursts of gunfire were at a rate of 15 and 16 shots per second (or 900 and 960 per minute), fired from a distance of about a quarter of a mile (450 meters).', 'Based on the erratic nature of the sound, Maher said that the shots seemed to be spread out, fired repeatedly in one direction. “Since the cracks are irregular, it seems more like the gunfire was being sprayed over the area.”', 'Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, said the rate of fire was consistent with the FN MAG, a heavily-used machine gun in the Israeli military’s arsenal. The FN MAG is commonly equipped on the IDF’s Merkava tanks, which several eyewitnesses said they saw open fire on the crowds.', 'Ball told CNN he could not confirm the specific weaponry used, or who fired it, but the rate of fire, he said, indicated it wasn’t consistent with machine guns used by Hamas.', 'Ball also said the tracer fire – ammunition containing a pyrotechnic charge illuminating its trajectory – seen in the GHF’s footage is consistent with the use of machine guns. “Typically belt fed machine guns have tracer rounds inserted every few rounds. So while only 3 tracers are visible in the video, more rounds were fired.”', 'Khalifa, who loved sports and bodybuilding, survived the harrowing night on Sunday only to be shot and killed by a drone two days later while heading to the same aid site to look for food, one of his close friends told CNN.', 'By daylight, video footage reviewed by CNN captured the dire scene near the coast, with several bodies strewn in the sand. The Palestinian health ministry said that more than 200 casualties reached hospitals, including dozens with serious injuries. It added that all of those killed had been shot in the head or chest.', 'The International Committee of the Red Cross said that its nearby field hospital was overwhelmed by patients, describing the carnage as the “highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident” since it opened over a year ago. Other dead and wounded were taken to Nasser Hospital.', '“It’s difficult to describe what we saw with the young and the old, there was severe injuries to the head, severe injuries to the lung,” recalled Dr. Ahmad Abou-Sweid, an Australian working at the Nasser medical complex.', '“There was a heavy proportion of head-targeted injuries from bullet wounds.”', 'Doctors working at Nasser Hospital shared photos with CNN of the bullets retrieved from patients injured and killed in the attack, which weapons experts say appear to match the type of ammunition used in the Israeli military’s machine guns. “This bullet is consistent with the NATO standard 7.62mm M80, which would be fired by IDF 7.62x51mm weapons, including the Negev 7.62 and FN MAG,” Ball said of one of the images.', 'GHF, which runs the site, insisted: “There was no gunfire in the (distribution) center and also not in the surrounding area.”', '“All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”', 'The IDF said allegations that Israeli soldiers fired on Gazans near or within the aid distribution site were “false reports.” It added: “Findings from an initial inquiry indicate that the IDF did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false.”', 'An Israeli military source told CNN that IDF troops did fire warning shots towards suspects approaching their position approximately a kilometer (1,100 yards) away from the aid distribution site in an incident that happened several hours before the site opened.', 'Ihab Musleh told CNN he had taken his two young sons along to the aid distribution center. When he told them to stay put at a nearby hill as he went inside the site, he heard more gunfire and rushed back out.', 'Yazeed, 13, was shot in the stomach by gunfire from an Israeli tank and survived his injuries, according to his dad.', '“He was waving his hands towards the tank and within seconds, he was hit with gunfire and fell to the ground,” Musleh said, speaking to CNN from the hospital where his son was being treated.', 'Other witnesses told CNN they were either injured or saw intense gunfire in the area after the aid site opened.', 'Mohammad Abu Rezeq was shot in the stomach upon arriving at Al-Alam where he said Israeli forces were deliberately targeting the crowd.', '“I have seen a lot of soldiers in this war. When they want to clear an area or warn you, they shoot around you. But yesterday, they were shooting to kill us,” Abu Rezeq said.', 'CNN asked the IDF about the claim from witnesses that its troops were firing directly at crowds, shooting to kill, but it gave no further comment beyond its published statement.', 'The chaos in the early hours of Sunday morning was not an isolated incident. In consecutive days since, Palestinians attempting to reach the GHF’s aid distribution sites have come under fire by the Israeli military.', 'After the intense gunfire near the Al-Alam roundabout on Sunday, GHF’s Facebook posts included updated maps of the safe route for the following days. The new maps included a large, red stop sign at Al-Alam.', 'On Tuesday, nearly 30 people were killed and dozens wounded while making their way to the aid sites in Tel al-Sultan in Rafah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health and Nasser Hospital.', 'The Israeli military said that its forces opened fire multiple times after identifying “several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes.”', '“The troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced toward the troops,” the IDF said in a statement, adding they were looking into reports of casualties.', 'While the Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots in the area three days in a row, posts from GHF’s Facebook page show the organization works in close coordination with the IDF to establish safe, defined routes.', 'GHF was set up amid Israeli accusations that Hamas is stealing aid in Gaza and profiting from sales, though Israel hasn’t presented any evidence publicly to back up the claim.', 'UN aid groups, such as UNRWA, typically check identification and rely on a database of registered families when distributing aid.', 'But GHF is not screening Palestinians at aid distribution sites, despite Israeli officials saying that additional security measures were a core reason for the creation of the new program.', 'UN aid agencies have criticized GHF’s aid mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles and raises the risks for Palestinians.', 'Criticism has been mounting against both Israel and GHF after chaos broke out last week when tens of thousands of starving Palestinians arrived at two new food distribution sites.', 'The UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, was scathing in his assessment to the UN Security Council late last month.', '“It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet,” he said.', '“It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”', 'Video edited by Oscar Featherstone in London. Tareq Al Hilou in Gaza contributed to this report.', 'The IDF has not directly responded to this article. But it later released to the media a recording of what it said was a Gaza resident speaking to an official at COGAT, the Israeli agency that coordinates the passage of aid into the territory. According to the IDF, the resident blames Hamas for preventing residents receiving aid, including by “firing at IDF troops near distribution points and spreading false claims about mass casualties near those areas.” CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the recording nor the identity of those speaking.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

"Who’s shooting whom near Rafah’s aid center, and who’s exploiting the bloodshed",https://www.timesofisrael.com/whos-shooting-whom-near-rafahs-aid-center-and-whos-exploiting-the-bloodshed/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 609', '', 'This Editor’s Note was sent out earlier Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.', 'On three successive days this week, Hamas alleged that Israeli troops opened fire at and near the newly established US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid distribution center in Rafah.', 'On Sunday, the terror group charged that 31 Gazans were killed by Israel, on Monday that the death toll was 3, and on Tuesday that 27 were killed. The way Hamas depicted it, and much of the world reported it, Israel was brutally gunning down Gaza civilians who were desperately seeking access to vital food supplies.', 'The International Committee of the Red Cross, a relatively credible source of medical information, said its field hospital in Rafah handled a mass casualty influx of 179 cases on Sunday, most of whom had gunshot and shrapnel wounds, and 21 were declared dead on arrival. All patients, it noted, said they had been trying to reach the aid site. On Tuesday, the ICRC reported another mass casualty incident, of 184 patients, 19 of whom were dead on arrival and another eight of whom died soon after. It does not appear to have issued a separate announcement on Monday, but its Tuesday statement referred to four mass casualty incidents in the previous 96 hours. Unlike Hamas, the Red Cross statements did not issue allegations of responsibility for the deaths and injuries.', 'The Israel Defense Forces has said it fired what it described as warning shots in the area of the aid center — about a kilometer away on Sunday and Monday, it said, and 500 meters away on Tuesday. It has acknowledged that its fire hit an unspecified number of people, but has not acknowledged killing anybody.', 'At a Tuesday evening televised press conference, IDF Spokesman Effie Defrin said Hamas’s figures were “exaggerated.” Relating to Tuesday’s incident, Defrin said “warning shots were fired” at suspects “who posed a threat to our forces, far from where they were supposed to be.” The shots were aimed so as “not to hit anyone,” he said.', 'Trying to pierce the fog of war and make sense of conflicting unverifiable claims has been spectacularly difficult ever since Hamas triggered almost 20 months of conflict with its unprovoked invasion of Israel, from territory it fully controlled, slaughtered 1,200 people for the crime of living in Israel, and abducted 251, of whom it still holds 57 captive.', '', 'Hamas had spent years turning Gaza into a terror state, its war machine deliberately constructed to utilize Gaza’s civilians as cover — their homes booby-trapped, mosques used as missile and arms depots, schools repurposed as command centers and tunnel access points, hospitals abused as hideouts with Hamas chiefs seeking to evade capture in warrens beneath them. For 20 months, Hamas has worked assiduously to misrepresent Israel as a capricious aggressor viciously targeting the Gazans that the terror chiefs have carefully ensured would find themselves in harm’s way.', 'Its depiction of Israeli forces cynically killing Gazans desperately seeking food this week has been one of its many tragic successes on this second battlefield — the war for global public, diplomatic and legal legitimacy and support. It’s a battlefield on which official Israel has for decades simply declined to deploy — refusing to allocate resources, to hire and train skilled personnel, to formulate a strategic approach — but never with such dire and abiding consequences as since October 7, 2023.', 'It is not definitively clear who killed the 61 Gazans Hamas alleges were shot this week at and near the Rafah aid center. It is not definitively clear that 61 Gazans were killed at all. It is not definitively clear who they were. Noncombatant men, women and children? Hamas and other gunmen killed in that area or elsewhere? Victims of Hamas gunfire? (It has been reported that Hamas has set up checkpoints and tried to stop Gazans from reaching aid centers. And the IDF on Sunday published footage it said showed gunmen opening fire at Gazans seeking to collect looted humanitarian aid in Khan Younis.)', 'It should be manifestly clear, however, that Israel has no interest in deliberately gunning down Gaza noncombatants approaching an aid center set up with Israel and American backing. Hamas, by contrast, has every interest in seeking to doom the aid project, which threatens its hold on Gaza aid, and constitutes an alternative to the trucks of supplies it has routinely commandeered, and either used for its forces or sold off to helpless Gazans to finance its efforts to recruit and revive. The trouble is that Israel does not maintain the mechanisms necessary to make very much at all manifestly clear.', 'Defrin, new to the post from which his broadly effective predecessor Daniel Hagari was essentially removed, defended the IDF’s failure to respond in anything close to real time to the daily global-headline-making Hamas-led allegations of Israeli mass murder by stressing that the IDF needs to investigate extensively before issuing specific responses to immensely sensitive accusations. The IDF has indeed lost credibility with hurried responses it was subsequently forced to correct regarding incidents such as the March killing of medics in a convoy in southern Gaza.', 'An effective civilian public diplomacy mechanism, however, would at least be capable of immediately explaining the context in which allegation and counter-allegation are hurled. Except that Israel refuses to properly task and staff such a hierarchy. According to the former head of the Public Diplomacy Directorate at the Prime Minister’s Office, Gadi Ezra, who left the post when the current government took office, the cabinet has not held a single meeting to discuss its public diplomacy strategy. Hundreds of millions of shekels were recently allocated to the Foreign Ministry for some kind of media room; it does not provide any kind of real-time response to unfolding events.', 'Official Israeli defeatism — and that’s what it is, defeatism — in the battle for world opinion is unforgivable. Competent public diplomacy would not shift the needle from one side to the other. It would nudge it a little, however, and give those who are minded to delve into the cause and effect of this conflict a basis for doing so.', 'Global judgments of right and wrong, aggressor and victim, however, are also affected by the declared policy governing the conduct of the war.', 'The IDF has stated that it is seeking to raise its hold on Gaza to 75% in the next few weeks, and push Gazans into limited largely coastal areas in the south, center and north of the Strip. But the IDF’s Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir has also said that it seeks to keep the war as short as possible in attaining victory — which he defined last week as returning the hostages, defeating Hamas and dismantling its rule. This is “not an endless war,” he insisted.', 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, says the war will not end until US President Donald Trump’s vision for the relocation of all Gazans is carried out. And far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir are avowedly bent on Israel permanently reoccupying and resettling a Gaza emptied of its Palestinian populace.', 'An initial IDF probe into Tuesday’s shootings reportedly has found that Palestinians heading to the aid center “got lost” en route to the distribution point, approached IDF soldiers, and were fired on when they failed to retreat. Other indications, some of which have been confirmed in military briefings, are that troops fired this week at what the IDF has called “suspects” who headed to the center before it was open and/or approached it from outside the designated safe route. Gaza, of course, is a war zone, and the IDF is charged with the highly complex task of protecting the aid distribution centers from deadly Hamas attack, protecting the intended aid recipients from Hamas, and ensuring the safety of its own troops — four of whom have been killed by Hamas elsewhere in the strip this week.', 'The fog of this particular juncture of the war would be cleared a little were the IDF to enable access for independent reporters to the new aid operation. But, as throughout this conflict, the IDF thinks it has more to lose via the risk of local or international war reporters getting killed or injured in Gaza than it has to gain from enabling independent reporting there.', 'Declining to provide access, failing to provide detailed real-time information and context on fast-changing and deadly events, and with its inadequate responses undermined by its own ministers’ radical policy goals for Gaza, Israel is failing itself and its would-be supporters on the second battlefield even as it continues to struggle to eliminate the Hamas threat on the first.', 'On Wednesday, the Gaza Humanitarian Federation suspended its operations for the day, to enable a logistical overhaul that aims to ensure it can handle the larger-than-expected crowds and coordinate more effective security procedures with the IDF — essentially to prevent the recurrence of whatever exactly has been happening this week. Hopefully, the one-day pause will enable an effective reset.', 'It will take a lot more than a day to resuscitate Israel’s public diplomacy, however, and there remains absolutely no sign that the government intends to embark on any such effort.', 'And worst of all, in this terrible, Hamas-sparked war, Israel’s cause and legitimacy are continually and deeply harmed by the empty-and-occupy Gaza goals of two coalition parties whose agenda dominates government policy.', '', '', '', 'We’re really pleased that you’ve read 4 Times of Israel articles in the past month.', 'You clearly find our careful reporting valuable, during an ongoing war when facts are often distorted and news coverage of Israel often lacks context.', 'Your support is essential to continue our work.

This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area.”', 'Tuesday’s violence was centered in a corner of Rafah, a once-teeming city on the border with Egypt, and which Israeli forces now largely control.
