His remarks come amid ongoing debates about balancing patient autonomy with regulatory oversight in emerging medical technologies.', 'Stem cell therapies, which remain largely unregulated in certain contexts, have been linked to serious adverse effects in some cases. Reports have documented instances where patients experienced blindness, tumor formation, and other injuries after undergoing experimental procedures. Critics argue that insufficient oversight has allowed unscrupulous providers to exploit vulnerable patients seeking alternative treatments. Proponents of broader access contend that experimental therapies offer hope for individuals facing conditions without established cures or effective treatments.
