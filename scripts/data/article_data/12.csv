However, critics have argued that the hundreds of millions of dollars that came in from Qatar allowed Hamas to focus on expanding its military arsenal in the years leading up to its October 7, 2023, attack when some 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel and another 251 were taken hostage.', '“Netanyahu didn’t want to work with the PA then because it would have meant advancing a broader diplomatic resolution to the conflict, and he is taking the same approach now,” the senior Arab diplomat said.', '“Arming clans in Gaza only further divides the Palestinians and increases the chances of a Somalia-like scenario in Gaza,” the ambassador said, expressing concern that the Strip will become a failed state characterized by lawlessness and rival militia groups.', 'Netanyahu’s decision to arm the Abu Shabab clan was kept secret from his far-right coalition partners, who would have likely come out against the move. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have long spoken out against Israel’s decision to arm the PA as part of the Oslo Accords.

It saves the lives of IDF soldiers.”', 'But an Israeli official told The Times of Israel that such schemes were only proposed by the Shin Bet because Netanyahu has barred the security establishment from advancing Gaza security initiatives that involve the PA.', 'Granting a foothold in Gaza to the Palestinian Authority — which backs a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — would likely have risked collapsing Netanyahu’s government, given Ben Gvir and Smotrich’s strong disregard for the PA.', 'Allowing the PA to play a role in Gaza would unlock the support of roughly half a dozen Arab countries who have expressed willingness to play a role in the post-war rehabilitation of Gaza if invited by Ramallah.', 'But that initiative has never gotten off the ground due to opposition from Netanyahu, who has likened the PA to Hamas, while rejecting the notion of entrusting Israel’s security to foreign actors.', 'The Israeli stance is widely understood to be an extension of Netanyahu’s efforts to thwart a two-state solution, which would be advanced by having a single governing authority in both Gaza and the West Bank, where the PA is currently based.', '', 'Supporting The Times of Israel isn’t a transaction for an online service, like subscribing to Netflix.

ISRAEL-BACKED MILITIAS LINKED TO ISIS LOOT GAZA AID UNDER IDF WATCH,https://www.mintpressnews.com/gaza-aid-looting-israel-isis-militias/289900/,"['Israeli officials often claim that Hamas has been looting aid heading to Gaza, yet the evidence suggests the opposite. New reports and eyewitness accounts indicate that Israel is backing ISIS-linked militants who are working to replace Hamas security forces and are looting humanitarian aid under the watchful eye of IDF drones.', 'New evidence recently emerged of ISIS-linked militants in Gaza, operating inside the Israeli-controlled buffer zone and controlling roads on which aid was destined to be transported. These armed men were photographed brandishing automatic weapons, wearing Israeli military tactical vests and bearing Palestinian flag patches on their helmets.', 'To the naked eye, they could be mistaken for Palestinian security force officers. In fact, they are members of an infamous criminal network responsible for looting humanitarian aid. On May 21, 15 World Food Program trucks carrying flour were looted, and UN sources suggest the perpetrators were these armed factions. Yet, they claim to be a legitimate opposition group poised to replace Hamas.', 'For some 80 days, Israel had imposed a total blockade on all food, medical supplies, water and fuel entering the territory. As soon as a small number of trucks were allowed to enter, the militants were spotted, sporting new military gear and poised to intercept the humanitarian supplies.', 'The IOF allows some flour trucks in and assigns Yasser Abu Shabab to secure them up to the crossing area.\nYasser Abu Shabab, who stole thousands of trucks before the truce and is now directly cooperating with the IOF.', 'Yasser and the IOF are two sides of the same coin.#Traitor pic.twitter.com/2LYByhXe3o', '— MOHAMMED From Gaza (@Its_Moh9) May 25, 2025', '', ' ', 'The leader of the Israeli-aligned militia is a man named Yasser Abu Shabab, a member of the Tarabin tribe that extends between the Naqab (Negev), Gaza and Sinai. However, he and others affiliated with the Tarabin have long been denounced as not representing the tribe due to their extensive criminal pasts.', 'Abu Shabab was well known in Gaza for his fierce opposition to Hamas and had been arrested for smuggling narcotics. He also maintained a direct connection to ISIS in the Egyptian Sinai. When Israeli bombing destroyed the jails run by Hamas security forces during the early days of the Gaza war, the infamous criminal managed to escape.', 'From there, Abu Shabab quickly began building a militant force numbering at least 100 men, many of whom were also previously imprisoned and had known ties to ISIS and al-Qaeda-linked groups.', 'An internal UN memo, reported by the Financial Times in November 2024, stated that Abu Shabab’s men were operating inside Israel’s buffer zone, looting aid shipments with “the passive, if not active benevolence” of Israeli forces. This is notable, as Israeli forces have routinely shot and killed civilians attempting to enter that same zone, even when coordinated in advance.', 'While these criminal factions began looting early into the Gaza war, they became more prominent following Israel’s invasion of Rafah on May 6, 2024. Up until that point, Hamas-led Palestinian police had helped coordinate aid deliveries through the Rafah Crossing.', 'This security was provided despite Israel threatening to bomb the police officers if they approached aid trucks, often forcing Gaza’s law enforcement into a hands-off role. But once Rafah was invaded and police disappeared, Israeli forces worked in proximity with criminal networks to intercept and sell stolen aid through intermediaries.', 'The result was a massive price hike for basic goods, with these gangs reportedly drip-feeding supplies to local sellers, maintaining artificial scarcity during a famine. Israel’s leading human rights organization, B’Tselem, has labeled the policy “manufacturing famine.”', 'Two sources working with aid agencies in Gaza confirmed to MintPress News that all aid entering the Strip is either subject to a bribe paid to these gangs or is partially or completely confiscated. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, stating that the gangs are widely believed to be coordinating with Israeli forces.', 'Prior to January 19, when a temporary ceasefire began, these gangs wore face coverings and operated as a ragtag militia. In recent weeks, however, they have rebranded themselves as the “Anti-Terror Service,” claiming to be a grassroots opposition to Hamas.', 'On Abu Shabab’s Facebook page, he now describes himself as a “grassroots leader who stood up against corruption and looting,” posting photos of himself patrolling roads and claiming to work with international aid organizations, to ensure the delivery of flour trucks.”', 'Back in November 2024, he told The Washington Post that “Hamas has left us with nothing,” even denying that his men carried weapons. He claimed that the looting was done by unarmed individuals and that they avoided stealing food intended for children. Yet aid workers and truck drivers insist his men are committing armed robbery.', 'Israel is aiding ISIS-linked terrorists & criminals to sow chaos & famine in Gaza:', 'Shadi al-Sofi, a wanted murderer & son of an informant/collaborator with Israel, & Yasser abu Shabab, a drug dealer, are the main warlords responsible for looting most aid under IDF protection.… pic.twitter.com/tnI1txqGSZ', '— Muhammad Shehada (@muhammadshehad2) November 19, 2024', '', 'Another warlord reportedly backed by Israel is Shadi al-Sufi, a convicted murderer and drug trafficker who had been sentenced to death. In 2020, he assassinated Jabr Al-Qiq, a senior commander in the PFLP’s Abu Ali Mustafa brigades. He reportedly later worked with ISIS contacts to escape to Sinai.', 'A senior official with a major humanitarian organization told MintPress News:', 'In the areas where the security forces are operating, the situation is always more stable, and they have repeatedly cracked down on black market operations. Anyone telling you the gangs are helping the people is a liar, that is all I can say.”', 'In November, Haaretz reported: “The IDF is aware of the problem. They said that at one point, the government had even considered making the clans to which the armed men belong responsible for distributing aid to Gaza’s residents, even though some of the clans’ members are involved in terrorism and some are affiliated with extremist organizations like the Islamic State.”', 'This now appears to be the Israeli strategy: to deputize these criminal gangs as a replacement security force to supplant Hamas rule. The makeover also coincides with efforts by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-linked initiative rumored to involve private military contractors, raising concerns that such groups may be tapped to cooperate with these armed networks.', 'A source affiliated with the Palestinian security forces in Gaza told Mint Press News that a similar strategy was attempted in northern Gaza, but that Hamas, working with politically unaffiliated locals, dismantled the criminal networks that began forming under Israeli supervision.', '', ' ', 'Meanwhile, the UN and every major humanitarian organization that has addressed the issue have pointed the finger at the gangs, not Hamas, for looting. None have reported credible instances of Hamas stealing aid. In fact, the Biden administration even asked Israel in February 2024 to halt its targeting of Hamas-led security forces, which had been helping coordinate the delivery of humanitarian trucks into Gaza.', '“Hamas is ISIS,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared. But recent actions by Israel suggest the opposite: that it is actively empowering Salafist factions to undermine Hamas in Gaza. In March, the Israeli military floated the idea of arming certain tribal clans to establish so-called “Hamas-free zones.” Among those considered was the Dughmush clan, long known for its links to ISIS.', 'Since Hamas was voted into power and took full control of Gaza in 2007, it has fought a years-long war against Salafi-jihadist factions inside the Strip. In 2009, it crushed an al-Qaeda-aligned uprising that left 22 dead. Sporadic bombings and assassination attempts followed.', 'Tensions between Hamas and al-Qaeda affiliates continued intermittently for years, marked by sporadic violence and periodic mass arrests, most notably in 2015, when Hamas detained over 50 Salafist militants after a wave of bombings targeting civilians in Gaza.', 'That same year, ISIS formally entered the fray. The Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, an ISIS affiliate, announced its presence in Gaza shortly after ISIS executed Hamas commander Sheikh Abu Salah Taha in Syria’s Yarmouk camp. Hamas responded swiftly: its security forces hunted down and killed the group’s leader, Younis Hunnar, in a gunfight.', 'In 2018, ISIS would officially “declare war” on Hamas, urging its followers to carry out attacks in order to overthrow the group in Gaza.', 'Now, in a bitter twist, Israel is backing many of these same elements. Under the guise of “aid security,” it is arming and enabling former ISIS and al-Qaeda-linked operatives, along with known traffickers and warlords, to carve out zones of control in Gaza. These forces are marketed as a grassroots alternative to Hamas. In practice, they are looting aid and destabilizing local governance under the watchful eye of Israeli drones.', 'Feature photo | Illustration by MintPress News', 'Robert Inlakesh is a political analyst, journalist and documentary filmmaker currently based in London, UK.

According to Hamas-linked sources, he escaped during an Israeli Air Force strike earlier in the war. He now commands a force estimated between 100 and 300 gunmen.', ""Abu Shabab's clan belongs to the Tarabin tribe, one of the largest in Gaza.

Despite this history, the clan itself has no ideological affiliation with the Islamic State."", 'Hamas has accused Abu Shabab of stealing aid shipments. A source within the group described him as ""a tool used by Israel to fragment the internal Palestinian front."" In late May, Hamas fighters attacked members of the new militia and published disturbing footage of the incident through its propaganda channels.

Who Is Yasser Abu Shabab?,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yasser-Abu-Shabab,"['', '', 'In the context of the Israel-Hamas War and the Gaza Strip, Yasser Abu Shabab is the leader of a Palestinian militia based in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip whose core members belong to a clan within the Tarabin Bedouin tribe, primarily known for its prominent trade network in the Sinai Peninsula and neighboring desert areas. In media reports from 2024 and into 2025, his militia has been described as a criminal gang or a large clan that both rivals Hamas and loots humanitarian aid. The militia calls itself the Popular Forces (PF), although it numbered only about 300 fighters in May 2025. That same month the PF drew attention when it attempted to secure aid delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial organization set up to centralize aid-distribution efforts under the supervision of the United States and Israel. On June 5, 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed suspicions that the Israeli government, through the efforts of its Shin Bet intelligence agency, had been arming and bolstering Abu Shabab’s militia as an alternative Palestinian force to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some of the militia’s Kalashnikov rifles were given to the group after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) seized the weapons from Hamas.', 'Abu Shabab, who was born in Rafah in the early 1990s, was previously imprisoned by Hamas on allegations that included theft and drug trafficking. He escaped during the Israel-Hamas War, and his network expanded in the power vacuum left by Hamas’s retreat from southern Gaza. In addition to having Israeli backing, Abu Shabab is believed by some sources to have received help from the Palestinian Authority (PA) to recruit the majority of his militia’s members, although he has been critical of the PA (as well as Hamas) on social media. Some Israelis who oppose their government aiding the group, most notably former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman (2016–18), have expressed worry that the militia is aligned with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Although some members of the Tarabin tribe have cooperated with ISIS in smuggling operations, Abu Shabab and his militia are not believed to have any ideological affiliation with the jihadist organization. The critique, however, highlights the security risk to Israel posed by arming the new Palestinian group: Under Netanyahu, the Israeli government employed a similar strategy toward Hamas—as a rival to the PA—before Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.', '']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iL0NnNVNXSG80WkRoT2FEZHhaVlo2VFJDUUF4allCQ2dLTWdrQmtJS0NPR093bWdB=-w280-h168-p-df
