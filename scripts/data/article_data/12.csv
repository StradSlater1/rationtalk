Italy’s citizenship referendum could make the country fairer. It’s a miracle it’s happening at all,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/italy-citizenship-referendum-government-italians,"['For decades, the state has been tightening its rules around who qualifies as Italian. This is a chance to fight back', 'W\nhen I first moved to Italy in 2012, I had no idea that more than a decade later I’d still be here. Back then, being British I had the luxury of EU citizenship, and thus of not overthinking things. I was excited by the prospect of spending time in a country that I’d always been fascinated by, and that was that. And yet, post-Brexit, I’m still here. Italy is my home. My community is here and I’ve made my career here. I speak the language fluently, and I’m even making progress with the hand gestures. Politically, I’ve lived through seven prime ministers – from Mario Monti to Giorgia Meloni – but, sadly, one thing I’ve never been able to do, in all these years, is vote in an election.', 'This weekend, Italians will participate in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. (My own path to citizenship is covered by a different, post-Brexit process. However, a yes vote would offer me another route if my various EU-era documents and residency proofs are found wanting by the Italian bureaucracy.)', 'Some of my neighbours face more serious obstacles. I recently attended an Italians Without Citizenship event; this grassroots organisation played a key role in gathering half a million signatures last year, which was required to bypass parliament and put this question directly in the hands of the people. Sonny, a 38-year-old man born in Italy to a Nigerian mother, told the small crowd that he’d been waiting for more than a decade to claim citizenship, because some vital documents were sent to the wrong address. Benedicta, whose parents are from Ghana, explained that she had recently gained citizenship after 17 years of bitter struggle. It’s estimated that as many as 1.4 million people, including 284,000 minors, are living in similar states of limbo, their paths to citizenship blocked due to clerical errors, insufficient income and other systemic obstacles.', 'The fact that this referendum is happening at all is therefore something of a miracle. For the past three decades, the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules so that fewer and fewer are eligible. And the political wind is still blowing very much in that direction. Last year, a broad coalition of parties put forward a proposal to introduce a so-called ius scholae reform, which would have automatically extended citizenship to foreign nationals who have completed a cycle of schooling. Meloni’s government quickly quashed their efforts. And just weeks ago, her administration enacted a law to prevent foreigners from claiming Italian citizenship by descent via their great-grandparents.', 'With the walls closing in, this weekend’s vote is a rare chance for Italians to make the country’s bureaucracy slightly more benevolent. But it has cultural implications, too. Citizens are being asked to go to the polls to make a statement about their own identity and, let’s face it, that identity, like any national identity, is so often tainted by bigotry. Meloni habitually prioritises white, heterosexual, “native” Christian families over other Italians, and millions support her. Yet a similar exclusionary logic persists, in more subtle forms, well beyond the far right. Take the dolce vita reverie of clean-cut youths dressed in designer clothes whizzing around on Vespas and eating pizza and pasta in family-run restaurants. How inclusive, really, is this widely accepted fantasy of a country perpetually frozen in the 1950s, that foreigners and Italians alike consume with such gusto?', 'Don’t get me wrong, I love old movies and nostalgic daydreaming as much as the next Italophile. But the focus on traditional identity all too easily feeds into a desire for ethnic and cultural homogeneity, which neglects so many people’s experiences. Where do Olympic volleyball gold medal winners Paola Egonu and Myriam Sylla fit into this national story, for example? Both are Italians with African ancestry, both are, undeniably, national heroes, yet both struggled to gain citizenship and both have faced discrimination since doing so. Or what about Khaby Lame, the world’s most followed TikToker, who, despite living in Italy since he was one, only gained citizenship in 2022, more than 20 years later? These are just the high-profile cases. By relaxing the rules on naturalisation, Italians would be recognising the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. Surely this is an opportunity for everyone involved?', 'Meloni and her colleagues do not see it that way. Earlier this week the prime minister declared that she “will not be collecting” her referendum ballot, and several high-profile ministers, including Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party, have been encouraging people to “head to the beach” instead of participating. The government seems to be hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, that the referendum will not reach quorum and that the organisers will be humiliated for their efforts.', 'As a future citizen, albeit one currently without a voice, I am crossing my fingers that enough of my neighbours will demonstrate the requisite common sense and civic duty to at least show up. Politics aside, this is an opportunity for those privileged with the right to vote to prove that they care as much about the future of Italy as I and so many of my fellow migrant-residents do.', 'Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in Florence']",World,https://news.google.com/api/attachments/CC8iK0NnNWhOSFJFUXpSV01YSkdiMEZ5VFJERUF4aW1CU2dLTWdZOUFKd1NtUWs=-w280-h168-p-df

This includes heated debates over how many immigrants should be welcomed to Italy, as the country suffers a demographic crisis with an aging population and one of the lowest birthrates in the world.', 'As well as asking Italians to vote to liberalize the labor market, the referendum sought to reduce the time it takes to become a naturalized citizen from 10 years to five years. Campaigners for the change said this would help second-generation Italians born in the country to non-European Union citizens. They can spend years, often long into adulthood, battling to get full citizenship rights from the only country they know to be their home.', ""Italian economists have said the change could also be a useful measure to address the problems resulting from Italy's aging society and low birthrate — just 12% of the population is younger than 14."", 'On Sunday and Monday, the two days of referendum voting, turnout was low and thus the referendum was declared void. Partial data from Italy\'s Interior Ministry published Sunday showed national turnout of just 22.7%, far below the 50% participation by eligible voters that is required for referendums in Italy to be valid. After polls closed on Monday, the YouTrend polling agency estimated voter participation to have been around 30% of eligible voters. In his concession speech, Landini said it was clear from the results that ""there is an obvious crisis of democracy.""', ""According to the Associated Press and Reuters, the new citizenship rules could have allowed some 2.5 million foreign nationals, about half of Italy's foreign population, to apply for citizenship."", ""This change was vehemently opposed by Meloni's right-wing Brothers of Italy party and other right-wing political parties, who have campaigned on reducing the number of foreign migrants in Italy and often see Italian identity as intimately linked with blood ancestry."", 'In the weeks leading up to the referendum, these politicians did not campaign for their supporters to vote ""no"" but simply called on them to boycott the process. Senate speaker Ignazio La Russa, from Brothers of Italy, said in May that he would ""campaign until people stay home.""', 'The Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Brothers of Italy circulated a memo to party members saying it was ""absolutely against"" the questions in the referendum and was therefore encouraging members to abstain from voting.', 'On Sunday, Meloni visited a polling station, but pointedly did not cast a vote.', ""Referendums have long been an important part of Italy's democracy. Brought in as part of a system of checks on power after the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini, some have resulted in a high turnout and consequential decisions, including the end of Italy's monarchy and confirming that divorce be allowed."", 'While Meloni\'s government is not the first to try to quash a referendum with a boycott — left-wing Italian leaders have done the same in the past — civil rights activists and opposition parties expressed outrage, saying this strategy violates ""the foundation of democracy.""', 'Elly Schlein, the leader of the center-left Democratic Party, said it was a ""betrayal of the constitutional principles that establish voting as a civic duty.""\n \nBetween 1974 and 1995, eight of nine referendums reached the quorum for voter participation.

This includes heated debates over how many immigrants should be welcomed to Italy, as the country suffers a demographic crisis with an aging population and one of the lowest birthrates in the world.', 'As well as asking Italians to vote to liberalize the labor market, the referendum sought to reduce the time it takes to become a naturalized citizen from 10 years to five years. Campaigners for the change said this would help second-generation Italians born in the country to non-European Union citizens. They can spend years, often long into adulthood, battling to get full citizenship rights from the only country they know to be their home.', ""Italian economists have said the change could also be a useful measure to address the problems resulting from Italy's aging society and low birthrate — just 12% of the population is younger than 14."", 'On Sunday and Monday, the two days of referendum voting, turnout was low and thus the referendum was declared void. Partial data from Italy\'s Interior Ministry published Sunday showed national turnout of just 22.7%, far below the 50% participation by eligible voters that is required for referendums in Italy to be valid. After polls closed on Monday, the YouTrend polling agency estimated voter participation to have been around 30% of eligible voters.

The June 8-9 ballot, which had also sought changes to rules on workers’ rights, saw a voter turnout of just 30.6 percent.', 'The result is a victory — albeit an unconventional one — for Meloni, president of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, which opposed the ballot and tactically aimed to depress turnout.
