Trump, in response, expressed disappointment in Musk, suggesting that his criticism stems from a sense of loss after leaving the administration. The tension escalated as Musk accused Trump of failing to release records related to Jeffrey Epstein, implying Trump's involvement.

One such event released an astonishing 25 times more energy than the most powerful supernova recorded, emitting energy equivalent to the lifetime output of 100 suns over the course of a year. ENTs are significantly rarer than supernovae, occurring millions of times less frequently, yet they provide valuable insights into the processes that contribute to the growth of the universe's largest black holes. The study, led by astronomer Hinkle, involved collaboration with observatories worldwide to investigate these unusual phenomena. The brightness of ENTs allows astronomers to observe them across vast cosmic distances, effectively looking back in time to understand black hole growth during a period when the universe was much younger and galaxies were more active in star formation and black hole feeding. **Questions:**",What implications do extreme nuclear transients have for our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in the early universe?,How might the discovery of ENTs change the way astronomers approach the study of cosmic events in the future?,In what ways do you think the rarity of ENTs compared to supernovae affects our ability to study and understand these phenomena?
