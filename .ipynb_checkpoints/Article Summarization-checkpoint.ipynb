       " 'If your flight is canceled or significantly delayed and you don’t want to be rebooked and you instead want a refund, you can go to delta.com/refund to apply for a refund.',\n",
       " 'Delta said it is “notifying customers about delays and cancellations in their itinerary via the Fly Delta app and text message, and offering rebooking options that can be managed online.”',\n",
       " 'But it also acknowledged that its Fly Delta app and Delta’s website have had spotty service, being overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of customers trying to get help. That’s making it difficult for customers to get information about their flights or rebooking.',\n",
       " '“Delta teams are working to stabilize those tools,” the airline said.',\n",
       " 'Delta customers have encountered more frustrations trying to get assistance from Delta, with some waiting for hours at airports to get rebooked or to get their checked bags back, while others wait hours for responses from Delta customer service on the phone or through messaging.',\n",
       " 'Many have tried reaching out to Delta on social media.',\n",
       " 'The company acknowledged some of the challenges by saying: “Also note that our ability to respond to service messages on social media platforms such as X are limited.”',\n",
       " 'Credit: John Spink',\n",
       " 'Delta said it will cover “eligible expenses” resulting from the flight disruption. The airline said it is “providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation” — but many passengers say they were not offered vouchers or hotels.',\n",
       " 'Another way for stranded passengers to get compensation for their extra expenses is to file for reimbursement from Delta.',\n",
       " '“Customers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement,” Delta said.',\n",
       " 'However, Delta said it “does not reimburse prepaid expenses, including but not limited to hotel reservations at the customer’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, concerts or other tickets.”',\n",
       " 'Delta said it is also issuing SkyMiles or a travel voucher, with the amount based on how much the passenger was affected during that time.',\n",
       " 'Many people with flights scheduled on Delta last weekend and this week have worried about whether they’ll also get caught up in the mass flight cancellations.',\n",
       " 'This has been a reality for thousands of people who ended up stuck after their trips were disrupted. But many others have managed to get on flights that were not canceled.',\n",
       " 'Some travel experts have advised travelers to avoid flying Delta while the airline’s operation remains dysfunctional and beleaguered with a backlog of thousands of stranded passengers trying to get home or to their destinations.',\n",
       " 'Delta encouraged this by issuing a travel waiver allowing people with flights booked for a certain period starting Friday, July 19, to change their travel plans without paying a higher fare, with certain conditions.',\n",
       " 'The waiver has been extended multiple times, and it was recently extended to last through Tuesday, July 23.',\n",
       " 'Some who have had flights canceled or are worried about the prospect have considered alternate transportation options, such as renting a car or taking a refund from Delta and looking for an alternate flight on another airline.',\n",
       " 'In a video message to employees on Monday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian signaled that he expects a full recovery to still take some time.',\n",
       " '“It’s going to take another couple of days before we’re in a position to say, ‘The worst is clearly behind us,’” Bastian said. Monday “will be a better day than yesterday, and hopefully Tuesday and Wednesday will be that much better again.”',\n",
       " 'Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta over the meltdown and its treatment of passengers.',\n",
       " 'The agency says Delta is legally obligated to care for its passengers and adhere to its commitments to customers.',\n",

       " 'The DOT said the Delta cancellations and delays are considered “controllable,” triggering a higher degree of commitments for handling passengers whose flights are disrupted.',\n",
       " 'On Tuesday, Buttigieg posted on social media platform X: “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions.

       "['FILE - A Delta Air Lines plane leaves the gate on July 12, 2021, at Logan International Airport in Boston. U.S. airline regulators have opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, which is still struggling to restore operations on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, more than four full days after a faulty software update caused technological havoc worldwide and disrupted global air travel. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) U.S. regulators are investigating how Delta Air Lines is treating passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights as the airline struggles to recover from a global technology outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the Delta investigation on the X social media platform Tuesday “to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.” “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” Buttigieg said. Delta and its Delta Connection partners canceled about 500 flights on Tuesday by midday on the East Coast, accounting for about two-thirds of all cancellations in the United States, according to trackng platform FlightAware. The outage began Thursday night into Friday morning, after a faulty software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to more than 8 million Microsoft computers around the world. The Atlanta-based carrier has canceled more than 6,600 flights since the outage started, far more than any other airline, according to figures from FlightAware and travel-data provider Cirium. Delta said it was cooperating with the investigation. “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,” an airline spokesperson said in a statement. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” Delta has said upward of half its technology systems run on Microsoft Windows, including a tool the airline uses to schedule pilots and flight attendants. The systems could not keep up with the high number of changes triggered by the outage. The collapse at Delta is stunning for an outfit that was widely viewed as the best big U.S. airline – the most profitable before and after the pandemic, and the best-run operation. Delta has almost always ranked near the top among all U.S. carriers for on-time performance. The Transportation Department said it launched the investigation after seeing Delta’s continued widespread flight disruptions “and reports of concerning customer service failures.” The department said the investigation will evolve as it “processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” Investigators are likely to focus on whether Delta is complying with federal rules and offering prompt refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed. In a text provided to The Associated Press, a Delta passenger whose flight was canceled Saturday was told, “If you prefer not to rebook your trip, your ticket value will automatically be available as an eCredit that can be used towards a future Delta ticket.” In Washington, lawmakers are beginning to weigh in. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chair of the Senate committee that oversees airlines, said in a letter to Delta CEO Ed Bastian that she is “concerned” that Delta is not complying with passenger rights contained in a law that Congress passed in May. “While the technology outage was clearly not caused by Delta or any airline, I am nevertheless concerned that Delta is failing to meet the moment and adequately protect the needs of passengers,” Cantwell wrote. Delta’s meltdown mirrors that of Southwest Airlines, which canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 15 days in December 2022. A Transportation Department investigation ended with Southwest agreeing to pay a $35 million fine as part of a $140 million settlement. Southwest blamed its breakdown on a winter storm, but other airlines recovered in a couple days while Southwest did not. Consumer advocates see the same pattern with Delta this month — the airline continues to blame the CrowdStrike outage while rivals such as American recovered quickly. Even United Airlines, the second-worst at cancellations, was back on track Monday. “It’s not about the thing that caused the problem, it’s about how you recover from the problem. That’s the test of an airline,” said William McGee, a former aircraft dispatcher who is a consumer advocate at the American Economic Liberties Project, a group critical of large corporations.',\n",
       " 'Airlines, banks, hospitals and companies worldwide have been hit with a Microsoft outage. FOX Business\\' Gerri Willis with the details. The federal government launched an investigation into Delta Air Lines as it struggles to get its operation back on track, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Tuesday. The Department of Transportation opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, which has canceled over 4,000 flights since Friday \"to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,\" Buttigieg posted on X.  \"All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,\" Buttigieg continued. GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OUTAGE DISRUPTS MAJOR AIRLINES, 911 SERVICES AND BUSINESSES Delta told FOX Business that it is fully cooperating with the department and is \"working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.\" The post came just one day after Buttigieg said that hundreds of complaints regarding service disruptions at Delta have been filed with the department. Since CrowdStrike\\'s global tech outage temporarily hindered airline operations last week, Delta has been struggling to recover its systems and restore its operations despite its rivals getting back to normal. Airline operations were halted as a result, causing 35,000 delays throughout the U.S. and 8,500 cancellations between Friday and as of 10 a.m. ET Monday, according to FlightAware spokesperson Kathleen Bangs. Delta had the most disruptions each day. CEO Ed Bastian said that \"a significant number of applications,\" including Delta\\'s crew tracking-related tools, rely on the Microsoft Windows operating system. \"Given that CrowdStrike and a bug in one of their applications caused us to have to essentially pause our entire operations, not just our operations, but our technology platform and reset on Friday, created a number of startup issues on a couple of very, very important applications,\" Bastian said in a note Monday.  Delta Air Lines Inc. Bastian previously said teams are working diligently to return to normal operations and said affected customers would receive either SkyMiles Program miles or a travel voucher.',\n",
       " 'U.S. airline regulators have opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, which is still struggling to restore operations on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, more than four full days after a faulty software update caused technological havoc worldwide and disrupted global air travel. Here, a Delta Air Lines plane leaves the gate on July 12, 2021, at Logan International Airport in Boston. Travelers, be sure to pack some patience. Chaos is still underway with Delta Air Lines, as the airline has entered its fifth day of flight cancelations and delays following Friday’s global software outage. And while the Atlanta-based carrier is still trying to get operations in order, the U.S. Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into the recent flight disruptions, citing “the high volume of consumer complaints” the department has received against Delta. “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement Tuesday. “This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law, and our department will leverage the full extent of our investigative and enforcement power to ensure the rights of Delta’s passengers are upheld,\" he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, Delta had canceled more than 400 flights and delayed roughly 860 flights for the day, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. In a statement to NPR, Delta Air Lines acknowledged the Department of Transportation’s notice of the investigation and said it is \"fully cooperating\" with the department. \"We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,\" the airline said in its statement, adding that teams are constantly working to get its operations back to normal. On Monday, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that the airline has been working to restore the software that tracks and schedules its flight crews. However, he noted that it may take a few days to fully restore the airline’s operations. In a public letter Sunday, Delta offered travel waivers to customers on flights impacted by the outage, allowing them to change itineraries and rebook their flights without any added fees. But in a post on X, Buttigieg said that under new federal regulations, customers are not obligated to accept the travel credit offered to rebook flights but are entitled to a prompt cash refund. \"Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance,\" he wrote. Millions of Microsoft users worldwide were knocked offline following a flawed software update from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity group. CrowdStrike said the problem was not a cyberattack but a \"software glitch.\" After identifying the issue, the company said it withdrew the \"problematic channel file\" that affected customers\\' systems. Delta’s technical issues are comparable to those that occurred with Southwest Airlines during the 2022 holiday travel season. The Dallas-based airline canceled thousands of flights and left millions of travelers stranded. Following the incident, the U.S. Transportation Department ordered Southwest to pay $140 million in a civil penalty, which was by far the largest the DOT has ever levied for consumers, the department said in a statement announcing the penalty.',\n",
       " 'Delta Air Lines\\nCEO Ed Bastian apologized and offered frequent flyer miles to travelers for thousands of flight cancellations as the carrier struggled to recover from Friday’s globe-spanning IT outage, disruptions that sparked criticism from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The Atlanta-based airline canceled over 4,600 flights from Friday through Sunday, more than any other airline, according to aviation data firm OAG. By Monday evening, Delta had already canceled another 900 flights, or 23% of its mainline operation, making up most of the day’s cancellations in the U.S., according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The delays and cancellations have put Delta in a rare spotlight for the carrier whose leaders pride themselves on reliability and punctuality, and who market the airline as a premium carrier. “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department,” Buttigieg said in an emailed statement late Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds” to customers who chose to call off their trips because of the disruptions as well as “timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The disruptions have persisted at Delta while most other carriers have recovered. American Airlines\\nsaid it was almost back to normal by Saturday. United Airlines\\nhad elevated flight disruptions on Sunday with 9% of its schedule canceled, or 260 flights, according to FlightAware, but still below Delta’s. “I want to apologize to every one of you who have been impacted by these events,” Bastian said in a message to customers over the weekend. The airline was offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up shifts, a staff memo on Sunday said. The carrier called some of them on their personal phones to come in, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. High demand during some one of the busiest periods of summer challenged the airline to find alternative flights for affected travelers, Bastian said in his note. On Sunday, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth forecast a financial hit of more than $160 million for Delta. Delta has a number of Microsoft\\ntools that were impacted in the outage, “in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in his note. That would make the event similar to an issue Southwest Airlines\\nsuffered, on a much greater scale, at the end of 2022 when it failed to recover from severe winter weather for days.',\n",
       " 'Federal transportation officials have launched an investigation into Delta Air Lines as the carrier struggled to rebound from an operations meltdown that led to thousands of canceled flights and stranded passengers. Delta’s turmoil, spurred by last week’s CrowdStrike-driven outage that struck businesses around the globe, extended into a fifth day.',\n",
       " 'The Department of Transportation is particularly concerned that Delta Air Lines is not adequately compensating passengers after canceling thousands of flights. The Department of Transportation is investigating Delta Air Lines over whether it\\'s \"following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions\" related to the CrowdStrike update mess, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced today. The agency is particularly concerned that Delta is not adequately compensating passengers after canceling thousands of flights since the start of the outage on Friday, including 400 on Tuesday. Delta leads all airlines with the most cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware.  \"All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,\" Buttigieg said on X. In its defense, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on Monday: “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be.” It looks like the airline is struggling to restore systems partly because around half of its IT systems use Windows. PCs and servers installed with both the OS and Crowdstrike’s cybersecurity software ended up bricking and displaying the “Blue Screen of Death” after CrowdStrike accidentally sent out a faulty update.  Delta has since had to send staff to manually fix and restore each affected Windows IT system. Those same computers also need time to synchronize their applications. “One of Delta’s most critical systems—which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time—is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize,” Delta says. Delta has been offering affected consumers the chance to modify their flights free of charge or cancel a flight with a full refund. In addition, the airline says it’ll reimburse passengers for any meals or hotels they booked due to the disruptions.  CrowdStrike has published a new advisory and video with steps on restoring a Windows system. In the meantime, the Department of Transportation says airline passengers affected by the delays at Delta or other providers can contact them through a government complaint form.',\n",
       " 'Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week’s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 2pm ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 466 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 28 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection. There were more than 1,000 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights. The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly. The DOT said it has received a “high volume of consumer complaints” about Delta’s actions since Friday. The department said if can penalize an airline for “an unfair and deceptive practice” if it finds finds that an airline provided inadequate customer assistance when flights are canceled or travel plans significantly changed. Buttigieg asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation. “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,” he tweeted. “We will follow up.” Delta said it cooperating with the investigation. RELATED ARTICLE\\nWhat Delta passengers are entitled to in terms of compensation “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation,” the company told CNN in a statement. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. Jeremy and Kaylee Jones were married on Saturday and left Spokane, Washington Monday for their honeymoon, they told CNN. Five guests weren’t able to attend the wedding due to flight issues. They arrived in Atlanta early Tuesday morning for a connecting flight from Atlanta to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. There were no issues with the flights until they landed in Atlanta this morning and saw the flight to St. Lucia was cancelled due to a lack of crew. The next Delta flight to St. Lucia is not until Friday, so they are canceling their honeymoon. The only other option is to be re-routed to other airports, which they believe will have the same problem, and they still don’t have their luggage. “I’m thinking the domino effect of flight cancellations are causing people to be stuck here for 5 days. I have no confidence in getting anywhere at this point.” This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In addition to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane. Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags. Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Business Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did. He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he’s gotten from the airline so far.',\n",
       " 'Delta people worked Monday to get the airline’s complex global operation back on track after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems of companies across the globe inoperable.    “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees on Monday. “Keep taking great care of our customers and each other in the coming days.”  Upward of half of Delta’s IT systems worldwide are Windows based. The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.    Delta’s crews are fully staffed and ready to serve our customers, but one of Delta’s most critical systems – which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time – is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize.   Across the operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as the airline works to put flight crews and aircraft back in position following the disruption.   Extending a travel waiver. Delta extended a travel waiver for all customers with travel booked from July 19-23. The waiver offers customers the ability to make a one-time change to their itinerary. The fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before July 28, in the same cabin of service as originally booked. Customers are encouraged to manage changes to their travel via delta.com or the Fly Delta app.  Right to a Refund Upon Request.

       " 'On Sunday morning, nearly 300 Delta flights were canceled at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport alone. ‘We’re sorry:’ Delta offers ‘acknowledgment’ to passengers stranded at Atlanta airport for days On Sunday morning, nearly 300 Delta flights were canceled at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport alone. ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines is “offering an acknowledgment” to passengers affected by hundreds of cancellations at airports across the country. On Sunday morning, nearly 300 Delta flights were canceled at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport alone. Just before Noon on Sunday, Delta spokespeople shared an updated statement on the global IT outage with Channel 2 Action News that detailed what they plan to do for affected customers. “We’re sorry for this inconvenience – canceling a flight is always our last resort and isn’t taken lightly,” the lengthy statement read in part. “Delta is communicating directly with significantly impacted customers via email Sunday offering an acknowledgment of the disruption, an apology and the issuance of SkyMiles Program miles or a travel voucher.” Channel 2′s Veronica Griffin was at the world’s busiest airport on Sunday morning where she spoke with travelers who say they’ve been left stranded at the airport, some of whom have been stuck there for days. Delta’s statement goes on to say that they are extending travel waivers to all passengers who booked travel from July 19 through 21 if they rebook travel for before July 26.',\n",
       " 'The US has opened an investigation into Delta Airlines as it struggles to recover from last week\\'s global IT outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Delta must provide passengers with refunds and other compensation for disrupted travel as required by law. A day earlier, Delta, which has cancelled more than 5,000 flights since Friday, signalled it could take several more days for operations to return to normal. It added: \"Recognising that Americans will undoubtedly feel the lasting, real-world consequences of this incident, they deserve to know in detail how this incident happened and the mitigation steps CrowdStrike is taking.” CrowdStrike said it was working on ways to make it easier and faster to fix the issue, which downed an estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices globally, hitting airlines, health systems and other services. In many cases, IT teams had to reboot computers manually. Delta, which appears to have had more difficulty recovering than other airlines, said that its crew-staffing system had been affected by the incident. As of Tuesday morning, it had already cancelled more than 400 flights and delayed hundreds of others, following more than 1,150 cancellations a day earlier, according to tracking firm Flight Aware. \"All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,\" Mr Buttigieg wrote on social media. \"While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up.\" The Biden administration in April finalised a rule requiring that airlines promptly and automatically refund passengers for significant changes to their travel, and other issues. It is part of a broader effort to step up policing of airlines after a series of major travel meltdowns. Last year, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $140m (£108m) resolve a Department of Transportation investigation launched after a storm disrupted service and set off a cascade of cancellations during the busy 2022 holiday travel period. The passenger has called for the States to stop defending the airline over delays and cancellation About 200 passengers destined for Cardiff have been trapped in Spain for days after cancellations. The airline said cost-concious customers were being \"more frugal and cautious\". If you face disruption because flights are cancelled or delayed you could be entitled to help.',\n",
       " \"Hundreds of thousands of travelers have been stranded by Delta flight cancellations, and many have to wait for hours to get assistance from the airline. Here’s what travelers should be aware of if their Delta flight is canceled. If the airline cancels or significantly delays your flight, you are entitled to a prompt refund if you don’t want to be rebooked on another flight, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. If your flight is canceled or significantly delayed and you don’t want to be rebooked and you instead want a refund, you can go to delta.com/refund to apply for a refund. Delta said it is “notifying customers about delays and cancellations in their itinerary via the Fly Delta app and text message, and offering rebooking options that can be managed online.” But it also acknowledged that its Fly Delta app and Delta’s website have had spotty service, being overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of customers trying to get help. That’s making it difficult for customers to get information about their flights or rebooking. “Delta teams are working to stabilize those tools,” the airline said. Delta customers have encountered more frustrations trying to get assistance from Delta, with some waiting for hours at airports to get rebooked or to get their checked bags back, while others wait hours for responses from Delta customer service on the phone or through messaging. Many have tried reaching out to Delta on social media. Delta said it will cover “eligible expenses” resulting from the flight disruption. The airline said it is “providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation” — but many passengers say they were not offered vouchers or hotels. Another way for stranded passengers to get compensation for their extra expenses is to file for reimbursement from Delta. “Customers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement,” Delta said. However, Delta said it “does not reimburse prepaid expenses, including but not limited to hotel reservations at the customer’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, concerts or other tickets.” Delta said it is also issuing SkyMiles or a travel voucher, with the amount based on how much the passenger was affected during that time. Many people with flights scheduled on Delta last weekend and this week have worried about whether they’ll also get caught up in the mass flight cancellations. This has been a reality for thousands of people who ended up stuck after their trips were disrupted. But many others have managed to get on flights that were not canceled. Some travel experts have advised travelers to avoid flying Delta while the airline’s operation remains dysfunctional and beleaguered with a backlog of thousands of stranded passengers trying to get home or to their destinations. Delta encouraged this by issuing a travel waiver allowing people with flights booked for a certain period starting Friday, July 19, to change their travel plans without paying a higher fare, with certain conditions. The waiver has been extended multiple times, and it was recently extended to last through Tuesday, July 23. Some who have had flights canceled or are worried about the prospect have considered alternate transportation options, such as renting a car or taking a refund from Delta and looking for an alternate flight on another airline. In a video message to employees on Monday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian signaled that he expects a full recovery to still take some time. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta over the meltdown and its treatment of passengers. The agency says Delta is legally obligated to care for its passengers and adhere to its commitments to customers. Buttigieg said he has “made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The DOT said the Delta cancellations and delays are considered “controllable,” triggering a higher degree of commitments for handling passengers whose flights are disrupted. On Tuesday, Buttigieg posted on social media platform X: “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up.” He directed travelers to the DOT’s online air travel service complaint form.

       " 'VIDEO: Passengers stranded after I.T. Outage SEATAC, Wash — Growing frustration for Delta passengers who have been stranded for days at Sea-Tac Airport. The lines at Delta Airlines counters remain long at Sea-Tac. The airline has canceled more than a third of its scheduled flights today alone. Nearly 17 hundred other flights have been delayed. Some passengers are telling you they are booking flights on other airlines. They say they have no other choice, especially since most other airlines are flying. This is after a glitch in software used around the world grounded five airlines late last week. But as you can see, Delta’s passengers are dealing with the brunt of it. These are Delta passengers, still stranded at Sea-Tac, some since late last week, because of a technology outage that grounded aircraft across the globe. “They took forever to put the bags on the crew timed out,” said Luann Lenz. She says that was yesterday. And they are still stuck at Sea-Tac. “We rebooked on United on our own,” Lenz said, “‘cause Delta didn’t have anything. We’re trying to get to Raleigh-Durham. And we don’t have, they didn’t have any flights going out that we could find until Thursday or Friday, at the earliest.”',\n",
       " 'Delta canceled another 400 flights Tuesday as its troubles in the wake of the global CrowdStrike-Microsoft IT outage dragged on for the fifth consecutive day. The Atlanta-based carrier also saw more than 300 flights delayed Tuesday. The ongoing issues have prompted the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection to open an inquiry into Delta, citing “the high volume of consumer complaints” it has received about issues at the carrier. “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments,” DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law, and our department will leverage the full extent of our investigative and enforcement power to ensure the rights of Delta’s passengers are upheld.” Delta has been uniquely affected by the global IT outage compared with other major carriers, who have since largely resumed normal operations. In a statement on its website Monday afternoon, Delta estimated that more than half of its IT systems worldwide rely on Microsoft Windows. Friday\\'s CrowdStrike error, it said, \"required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.\" It continued: \"One of Delta’s most critical systems — which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time — is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize,\" it said. A Delta representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.    Social media has been filled with images of passengers stranded away from their destinations. An additional complicating factor has been coordinating flyers\\' luggage as they seek to rebook, reflected in a significant volume of Delta\\'s social media team responses on X related to baggage issues. Bastian said the company is working around the clock to get its operation back on track, but it will take another couple of days before the worst is over.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg announced an investigation into Delta Air Lines on Tuesday as fallout from last week’s global IT outage continued to impact would-be flyers at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and other airports. More:New airline refund rule could get you money back for delayed flights The outage, said to have been caused by a faulty update by cyber security firm CrowdStrike that impacted Microsoft’s Windows Operating System, hit major airlines and infrastructure but Delta was one airline still seeing major flight disruptions as of Tuesday. And social media users were calling out the airline, saying it was not properly supporting their efforts to get home or get a place to stay or food until they can. Detroit wasn’t the airport experiencing the most misery for cancellations and delays for all airlines as of about 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to FlightAware. That was Atlanta’s airport. But Detroit had seen 132 cancellations in the last 24 hours, with 26 flights originating from Detroit canceled and 52 delayed on Tuesday. Delta had more than 400 cancellations, not specific to Detroit, by 9 a.m. Tuesday and in the time since the outage had canceled more flights than it canceled for half of 2023, USA Today reported. Buttigieg, in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, said his department is probing to make sure the law is followed and that Delta is “taking care of its passengers” as the disruptions continue.   “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” he said. He encouraged customers to try to resolve issues directly with the airline, but offered a link to file complaints for those who believe Delta is not following passenger protection requirements. In a statement provided to the Free Press, Delta acknowledged the investigation and said it was cooperating: “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable. Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.”     Flight delayed for hours?How to figure out when you get can a refund or rebooked. Delta, in a news release Monday, said upward of half of its IT systems worldwide are Windows-based and require manual repairs and rebooting. It also stated its system that makes sure full crews are available at the right place and time requires the most time and manual support. The company promised a travel waiver from July 19-23, a refund upon request, travel vouchers, coverage of eligible expense including meals, hotels and ground transportation, and rebooking options. It also stated that the company does not reimburse prepaid expenses, including hotel reservations at a customer’s destination, lost wages or event tickets. Jeff Fargo, his 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son are some of the customers left stranded in Detroit. The family was on their way to return home to Las Vegas after a 10-day stay in upstate New York visiting Fargo’s parents when their typical layover at DTW turned into a living nightmare. The three arrived in Detroit around 7:30 p.m. Monday night when they received news that their continuing flight had been rescheduled and later cancelled. After waiting in line at Delta’s customer service desk for 45 minutes, Fargo says he was told that the company would not be offering vouchers or reimbursement for hotel stays, food and other surprise expenses. Anxious to get his kids and himself home, Fargo said he looked at renting a car to drive from Detroit to Las Vegas, only to find that businesses in the metro Detroit area aren’t allowing for one-way car rentals. As of Tuesday afternoon, Fargo found a Southwest flight that could get his family home, but not after forcing Fargo to cancel the filming of an episode of his podcast as well as other work meetings, leaving him and his children with no clean clothes, and causing withdrawal symptoms without access to the medications that Fargo has been taking for years. After Ubering to TJ Maxx and a grocery stores from hotel to buy him and his children some clean clothes, Fargo says the repercussions of the flight failure is in the hundreds of dollars – most of which he says he doesn’t think will be returned from Delta. “Luckily I have the means to take care of myself and my children, but what if I didn’t?” he said. “It would’ve been Delta’s fault for compromising the safety and wellness of my family.” Before the delay, Fargo had Delta silver medallion status, and had already spent enough money on flights this year to qualify for silver medallion next year. But now, Fargo says he’d rather walk than buy a ticket with Delta. “I will never fly Delta again, even if they offer me a trip around the world for free,” he said.',\n",
       " 'Delta Air Lines Inc. customers aren’t the only ones unhappy about the thousands of flights the carrier has canceled since Friday. Its pilots are, too.

       " 'More than 12 Delta Air Lines flights were canceled Tuesday at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the fifth-straight day of travel issues caused by a widespread IT outage. The massive global tech outage that hit individuals and companies on Friday is still disrupting global air travels days later. On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta Air Lines to ensure that Delta is following the law and following newly-established passenger protections. The protections mean that if passengers’ flights are canceled, they can get a refund if they choose not to travel. It also means the passengers get a refund if the flight is significantly delayed. Additionally, baggage fees are supposed to be returned if a passenger’s bags are lost. Buttigieg’s post on X also instructed airline passengers to try and resolve problems directly with the airline first. If that doesn’t work, then file a complaint with the DOT. The DOT also has a list on its website of what different airlines are committed to do for passengers in case of a problem. Buttigieg wrote in a statement late Sunday night, “Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancelations.” Delta has canceled more than 4,000 flights since Friday. Most airlines have recovered from Friday\\'s outage, but Delta has been especially hard hit, leaving some stranded for days. Jerry Matthews told WRAL News he was traveling to Tampa with a family of 17 people for vacation when he got stranded at the airport. \"We went online and tried to find a flight to Tampa … nothing’s available,\" he said. Many Delta passengers said they had to book with other airlines to reach their final destinations. On Monday, the airline said it would cover or reimburse for meal vouchers and hotels. It also said all customers who booked flights between July 19 to 23 will be able to change their itineraries once or get a refund. Delta executives previously said remedying this issue would take days. For Skip Horne, who has been recovering from back surgery, it’s been a pain – literally. Horne\\'s flight on Monday was canceled, and there was not another available flight until Tuesday, leaving him waiting 24 hours inside RDU. \"What choice do I have?\" Horne said. \"I already checked out of my hotel, I have nowhere to go. This is my home for today.\" Horne, like thousands of passengers nationwide, found himself stranded Monday. \"We’re so tired,\" Castillo said. \"It’s been a long day for us. Going hotel by hotel, and we’re trying to get home. But we can’t.\" A stop in Detroit Saturday turned into a two-day layover for the family. They’re now stuck at RDU after yet another cancelation. \"I already tried to look at West Palm Beach, or Miami, or Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, anywhere, but they still say they cannot find anything for like three days,\" Castillo said. Castillo said it’s been a fight trying to get vouchers for food or hotels something the federal government says passengers dealing with flights canceled because of the computer outage are owed.',\n",
       " 'Experts said it could take airlines weeks to recover from the massive cybersecurity error The Biden administration has launched an investigation into Delta Airlines as the company continues to struggle from the fallout of the CrowdStrike failure. The US Department of Transportation has received hundreds of complaints about the airline since Friday, when the cybersecurity company launched a faulty software update that brought down Microsoft systems globally, impacting retailers and top airlines. While most airlines have since recovered, Delta is still working to get back on track. According to FlightAware, a commercial flight tracker, the company was leading the number of delays and cancellations at 779 and 460 on Tuesday. “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees on Monday. “Keep taking great care of our customers and each other in the coming days.” The airline explained that more than half of Delta IT systems worldwide are Windows-based. The error required the company’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems. One of Delta’s most critical systems, which makes sure all flights have a full crew, requires the most time and manual support to synchronize. The DOT confirmed the investigation in a statement to The Independent. “This process will continue to evolve as DOT learns more and processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg added: “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments. This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law. In a statement responding to the investigation, the airline said: “Delta is in receipt of the Department’s notice of investigation and is fully cooperating.” The House Homeland Security Committee has called on CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz to testify over the incident, which brought airline operations to a standstill and left billboards in Times Square blank on Friday. Experts have said it may take days, or even weeks, to resolve the chaos caused by the outage across sectors, requiring millions of labor hours.',\n",
       " 'Delta has canceled or delayed more than 1,100 flights on Monday as it struggles to recover from a massive technology outage that first froze air travel nationwide on Friday. The airline canceled about 690 flights and delayed about 420 on Monday, according to the tracking service FlightAware. It comes a day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called out Delta for the lingering cancelations and delays from Friday’s outage. A bug in the security software CrowdStrike shut down computer systems globally on Friday, with airlines being one of the most affected industries.  Delta was the only airline to still have a significant number of cancelations and delays as of Monday, after it canceled more than 1,300 flights on Sunday and about 1,200 each Friday and Saturday. “We have received reports of continued disruptions and unacceptable customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with U.S. DOT,” Buttigieg wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we will hold them to all applicable passenger protections.” He also called on the airline to provide proper refunds and hotel accommodations for stranded passengers. “No one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent,” Buttigieg wrote. Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized to customers in a statement Sunday, saying the airline was hit especially hard by the tech outage because it relies on CrowdStrike-affected computer systems for its crew management software. “Cancellations continue on Sunday as Delta’s teams work to recover our systems and restore our operation. Canceling a flight is always a last resort, and something we don’t take lightly,” he wrote.',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (WABC) -- If you booked a vacation and flew Delta last weekend, going back to the office is probably less stressful. One woman we spoke with hadn\\'t slept in more than 24 hours. She spent hours bouncing back and forth from area airports when she was supposed to be in Europe. \"Our flight took off two hours late. They told us that we were going to make our connection. It was going to be very tight and then when we got to JFK we sat on the runway for 40 minutes. And so they still told us we were going to make it if we ran for it,\" Jamie Paulen said. Paulen from Raleigh was on her way to relaxing vacation in Iceland. Or so she thought, until the layover from hell at JFK. It was midnight. She and her kids were the first ones off the plane. They sprinted to their connection. \"We got there and they just shut the gate. So they told us that I had to get in line. So I waited in line for 3 hours and they booked us on another flight but she didn\\'t tell me that we were going to Newark. So I actually almost went to JFK,\" she said. She\\'s among the Delta Airlines customers living in a travel nightmare. The airline is struggling to bounce back from the Microsoft computer outage. The disruptions have dragged into the fifth day. \"My flight was supposed to be 6 o\\'clock this morning. I\\'m from Long Island and I was supposed to leave from JFK. I had to rebook to Philadelphia and now I\\'m here in Newark,\" Donyshia Boston-Hill said. Other airlines got back to normal by the weekend but Delta had to cancel 1,100 flights on Monday, which was more than a quarter of its flights. Hundreds more were canceled on Tuesday. More than 7-thousand in all since Friday. The airline\\'s CEO says it will take a few more days to resolve the issues. The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched an investigation into Delta Airlines, Secretary Pete Buttigieg says, \"to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.\" Delta says it is fully cooperating and working tirelessly to make it right for customers. \"There\\'s been a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of issues with delta at this point,\" traveler Steve Mansor said. Mansor would rather see less words, and more action from Delta. He was considering renting a car to drive back home to Detroit from Newark after his 1:00 p.m. flight was canceled. \"The only later flight that I saw was 8:20 and I don\\'t want to risk having to stay at the airport because hotels are booked,\" Mansor said. The outage happened on the busiest weekend of the summer for Delta. The airline says customers who\\'ve incurred hotel, meal, or transportation expenses may be eligible for reimbursement. Delta\\'s meltdown mirrors that of Southwest Airlines, which canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 15 days in December 2022. A Transportation Department investigation ended with Southwest agreeing to pay a $35 million fine as part of a $140 million settlement. Southwest blamed its breakdown on a winter storm, but other airlines recovered in a couple days while Southwest did not. Consumer advocates see the same pattern with Delta this month - the airline continues to blame the CrowdStrike outage while rivals such as American recovered quickly, and even United Airlines, the second-worst at cancellations, was back on track Monday.',\n",
       " 'Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, made the announcement after the airline suspended travel for unaccompanied minors. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that his department had opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines after the tech outage last week disrupted flights worldwide, and the agency wanted to hear from travelers who said that the airline had not complied with passenger protection requirements. The aim of the investigation is to “ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,” Mr. Buttigieg said in a statement. “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly,” he added. The Transportation Department has consumer protection requirements that cover lost baggage, lengthy tarmac delays, compensation for being bumped from an overbooked flight and other protections. Passengers should try to resolve their travel issues directly with Delta, Mr. Buttigieg said, but the department wanted to hear from those who thought the airline “has not complied” with the protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. His announcement included a link to a form for passengers to provide information about their concerns. Mr. Buttigieg’s statement did not specifically mention the reports of unaccompanied minors being stranded at airports, but the department said in an email that it was “seeking answers” about the situation and that it was “extremely concerned.” We “have made clear that we expect Delta to prioritize getting kids safely and swiftly to their destinations,” the emailed statement said. Delta barred children under 18 from traveling without a guardian as it struggled to recover from the global technology outage on Friday, which crippled Microsoft systems, hobbling train networks, disrupting hospitals and forcing airlines around the world to ground flights. The airline initially suspended travel for unaccompanied minors until Sunday, but then it extended the suspension through Tuesday. “Those already booked will not be able to travel,” Delta’s website said. “Please do not book new travel for unaccompanied minors during this time.” Delta has been the slowest U.S. airline to restore its operations, canceling more than 1,000 flights each day from Friday to Monday. More than 450 had been canceled as of midday on Tuesday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Some families said they had not been notified of the change until their children were turned away at the airline counter at the airport. The airline said on Tuesday that it was cooperating with the Transportation Department’s investigation. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta,” the company said in a statement. Some Delta employees have also expressed frustration with the airline’s struggles to recover from the technology outage last week. Capt. Darren Hartmann, the chairman of the company’s pilots union, the Delta Master Executive Council, said in a message to his members that the pilots felt “that we have been abandoned in the system” after being stranded at airports and being unable to get in touch with anyone at the company.',\n",

(Atlanta News First) - The chaos continues at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as Delta Air Lines works to fully bounce back following the global IT outage from a software defect on Friday that caused thousands of flight cancellations and delays. As other carriers have returned to normal, Delta’s meltdown could continue for another few days. Some travelers say they have been stranded at the Atlanta airport for five days now with no end in sight. Delta says it’s working with an impaired crew tracking system, which has caused major hiccups in the recovery process. Nearly 200 Delta flights have already been canceled for Tuesday, according to FlightAware, and mass amounts of luggage are missing. Thousands of unclaimed suitcases have filled Delta’s baggage claim centers globally, including in Atlanta. >> HOW TO GET REIMBURSED BY DELTA “The bags went without us. Went to Newark. They wouldn’t let us board the plane,” traveler Roderick Taylor said. “Our plane never came in. It kept getting canceled, canceled. We stayed here for about 15 to 16 hours on Friday, because we couldn’t get on the plane. Just wondering why if we couldn’t get on the plane, why would you take our luggage to Newark and we couldn’t go? It was so frustrating.” Taylor was heading up north for a cruise with his wife and a group of friends. However, he never made it. “It’s my first time ever going through this at the airport,” Taylor said. “It was total chaos. People everywhere. People laying everywhere, sleeping everywhere. It was like being around a homeless shelter.” Taylor’s wife, Marcellia, spent the last few days with her eyes glued on Delta’s luggage tracker and her ears bonded to her phone. “Kept calling and calling. Couldn’t get through. So finally, yesterday, I got through,” she said. “I held on the phone for like five hours to get someone to get a file number to get my luggage sent from Newark back to Atlanta.” While some passengers have been frustrated, other flyers say they understand. “Delta has really taken care of us. They’ve been really good for us,” traveler Shawn Mohr said. “I would say take a deep breath. Let people do their job. These folks are professionals and let them be professionals. Be courteous. Because they’re here plenty more hours than we are, and they feel what we’re going through.” Meanwhile, the United States of Transportation (DOT) has opened an investigation into Delta’s handling of the outage. “U.S. DOT has opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions. All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. Delta officials said the company is working around the clock to recover. They’ve added dozens of staff in baggage claim areas to help expedite the return of all bags as soon as possible.

       " 'Thousands of people are without their luggage after Delta Airlines experienced significant flight operation disruptions over the weekend. The airline had to cancel thousands of flights on Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the worldwide CrowdStrike outage. While nearly every airline in the United States was impacted by the outage, Delta Airlines appeared to be the only airline still navigating major issues connected to the outage at Denver International Airport by Monday.  On the fifth level baggage claim area, only Delta had thousands of luggage bags scattered around their claim. \"I was a little nervous when I walked up and saw the sea of luggage,\" said Amy Clifton, a Delta customer.  Clifton and her husband were in Colorado on business and then vacation. They purchased flights home to Atlanta via Delta with the hope of being home by Monday afternoon. However, Delta\\'s system and lack of available staffing have snowballed into a third consecutive day of major cancellations.  \"I heard a worker say the bags behind us have been here for a few days,* Clifton told CBS News Colorado\\'s Dillon Thomas.  Unlike many, the Clifton\\'s quickly reclaimed their bags even after checking them in. However, many others either departed Colorado or left the airport in recent days without knowing where their bags were.  Delta Airlines told CBS News this outage came amid their busiest travel weekend of the entire summer.

       " '‘Vacation from hell’: Delta passengers stranded for fourth straight day BOSTON — Thousands of Delta passengers were stranded for a fourth straight day as the airline still struggles to recover from the largest IT outage in history. Delta cancelled more than 20 percent of its trips in or out of Boston’s Logan Airport for much of the day on Monday. It followed the cancellation of about 1,300 Delta flights on Sunday, roughly the same number as each of the previous two days. Friday’s tech outage hit Delta especially hard. The airline’s CEO said it affected not only their rebooking system but also crew tracking tools, which ensures that flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time. “It has been a nightmare. This is the vacation from hell,” said Roberta Harris of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Roberta and Jim Harris departed Florida on Friday morning and then got stranded on what felt like a never-ending layover in Atlanta. “From there it just went to hell,” she said. “We would wait in line for hours, and they would cancel the flight at the last minute.” The couple was supposed to arrive in Boston Friday afternoon around 3p for a cruise to Iceland and Greenland. They finally arrived at Logan around 5 p.m. on Monday after five cancelled flights on Delta. “Now we have to try to catch up to that ship,” said Jim Harris. “By the time we get there, the cruise will be half over!”',\n",
       " 'Most of the world has slowly recovered from the devastating CrowdStrike and Microsoft outages that hamstrung countless businesses and industries last Friday. One airline, however, is still struggling early this week. Delta Airlines is still dealing with numerous cancelled flights and delays. It\\'s become clear the airline has had a much more difficult time getting back on its feet than other companies across nearly all sectors of the economy. Around midday Tuesday, more than 455 Delta flights had been cancelled, far outpacing any other airline, according to data from FlightAware. It also had more than 650 delays. Computer systems in airports, at airlines, and pretty much everywhere else went down Friday, but Delta has had unique struggles trying to recover. The issue with Delta largely stems from a crew-tracking tool that relies on Windows, leaving the airline in a difficult position as it tried to manage the overwhelming schedule changes caused by the outages. “The technology issue occurred on the busiest travel weekend of the summer, with our booked loads exceeding 90%, limiting our re-accommodation capabilities,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in a letter to customers. \"Specifically, the issue impacted the Microsoft Windows operating system. Delta has a significant number of applications that use that system, and in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown. Our teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.\" Delta has to manually reset a ton of computers. Half its IT systems are Windows-based, which meant they crashed and need to be manually fixed after the CrowdStrike issue. \"The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other,\" the company said in statement. So if you\\'re flying Delta on Tuesday or the upcoming days, just know there\\'s a good chance the airline is still reeling from the CrowdStrike outages.',\n",

       " 'The carrier also scrubbed hundreds of flights over the weekend after a defective software update knocked out computer systems worldwide. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 800 flights Monday as it struggled to recover from a global tech outage that rippled through the global economy four days earlier, even while other airlines and some major health-care organizations largely returned to normal. The Atlanta-based carrier had already scuttled hundreds of flights after a software update Friday knocked out computer systems worldwide, sparking widespread disruptions at airports, hospitals and an array of other businesses. On Sunday alone, Delta recorded more than 1,300 cancellations and about 1,600 delays, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Delta has been the subject of hundreds of complaints filed with the U.S. Transportation Department over “continued disruptions and unacceptable customer service conditions,” according to a social media post Sunday from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “I have made clear to Delta that we will hold them to all applicable passenger protections,” Buttigieg said. In a Sunday blog post, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said that the outage had affected an important tool related to crew tracking and that it was unable to effectively process the “unprecedented” number of changes triggered by the system shutdown. “Our teams have been working around-the-clock to recover and restore full functionality,” Bastian wrote. The outage has taken a bigger toll on Delta than its rivals. It scrubbed 1,200 flights Friday, while United Airlines canceled 649 flights, American Airlines scrapped 408 and Spirit Airlines cut 234. All told, there were about 46,000 flights canceled worldwide Friday, according to FlightAware. As of midafternoon Monday, the number of total worldwide cancellations had fallen to about 1,500. The Transportation Department said in a statement that airlines aside from Delta have “largely been able to recover.” Windows-controlled medical devices, medical records, pharmacy orders and more were affected, he noted, adding that more and more hospitals had installed CrowdStrike in the past few years because of the devastation wreaked by ransomware gangs. The problems with airline staffing tools drew comparisons to the 2022 Christmas meltdown at Southwest Airlines, which canceled or significantly delayed about 16,900 flights, disrupting the travel plans of 2 million people, according to a Transportation Department investigation. In that case, a winter storm spiraled into a broader staffing crisis as the airline’s system for matching crew members with aircraft couldn’t keep up. The agency ultimately fined Southwest $140 million over its handling of the crisis. Delta said Monday that it had communicated directly with customers, offering them an apology along with SkyMiles program miles or a travel voucher. It also offered to cover certain expenses through meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and ground transportation. Additionally, the carrier extended a travel waiver allowing previously scheduled fliers to rebook their flights free. The Transportation Department has emphasized that Delta must inform its customers that they are entitled to a refund if they choose not to travel. The department lists each airline’s customer service commitments in the event of “controllable” cancellations and delays on the website flightrights.gov.',\n",

And Delta\\'s hub of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport has been particularly hard-hit. If you\\'ve already been affected by the chaos, or are planning travel on Delta soon, you may have options. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg made it clear in an X posting on Sunday night: \"Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays.\" On Tuesday, Delta extended its travel waiver for all passengers with scheduled departures through July 28. The waiver allows you to reschedule your flight for anytime through Aug. 4 in the same class of service without paying any change fee (in the case of Basic Economy tickets) or a fare difference. If you rebook your flight for after Aug. 4, any change fee is waived, but you would still pay the fare difference. If you\\'re unable the reschedule at this time, Delta\\'s waiver allows you to cancel your reservation and apply the value to a future travel credit, to be used within one year of when you bought your original ticket. But it may be worth waiting to see if Delta cancels your flight first (see below). If Delta\\'s scheduling problems continue, we may see the eligible dates for this waiver extended, so stay tuned if you have travel coming later in the week. Of course, all airlines would like you accept a voucher or credit, for use on their own metal, when your flight is canceled or delayed. But that often obscures the important thing for consumers: If an airline cancels or significantly changes your flight — and you don\\'t accept an alternative flight — you are entitled to a full cash refund. A \"significant change\" would include departing or arriving more than three hours late, or a change of airport or in the number of connections, according to the Department of Transportation. Delta\\'s own guidelines are better: They allow you to cancel and receive a refund to your original form of payment after a more than 120-minute delay. To get started on a cancellation and refund, go to delta.com/refund-form. If your travel nightmare has led to additional meal, transportation and lodging expenses, save your receipts. As indicated by Buttigieg, airlines must reimburse for such necessary expenses in the case of a cancellation or significant delay under the airline\\'s control. But Delta says it will not reimburse for \"other airline tickets, prepaid expenses, including hotels and activities at your destination, or lost wages.\" Delta\\'s reimbursement request form is at delta.com/reimbursement.

A Delta Air Lines jet sits at a gate at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. (Photo by Daniel SLIM) At\\n8:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday, Delta Air Lines had already canceled 416 flights and delayed another 323. Together, 20% of the airline’s daily scheduled departures were disrupted, according to FlightAware. By 3 p.m., the tally of disrupted flights had ticked up significantly to 467 cancellations and 998 delays, representing 41% of Delta’s scheduled flights for the day. Air travelers can expect this number to increase throughout the afternoon and evening. The Atlanta-based carrier lags behind competitors in returning to normal operations after the CrowdStrike software update grounded flights globally on Friday. More than half of Delta’s IT systems worldwide are Windows-based, the company said in a statement, noting that outage impacted the airline’s “deeply complex” staffing software system. “The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.” “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees on Monday. “Keep taking great care of our customers and each other in the coming days.” On Monday, three-quarters of Delta’s scheduled departures were either canceled (30%) or delayed (46%). Comparatively, rivals American Airlines and United Airlines saw 50% and 33%, respectively, of their flights delayed on Monday. Both airlines canceled only 2% of Monday’s flights, respectively. “The [Department of Transportation] has opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on Threads on Tuesday morning. “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld.” The statement follows a similar thread yesterday in which the secretary promised to “hold [Delta] to all applicable passenger protections,” adding that “Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance.” Delta has extended its travel waiver for passengers whose flights were booked for July 19-23. The waiver lets customers make a one-time change to their itinerary. The fare difference for customers will be waived if flights are rebooked for travel on or before July 28. Customers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed flight may receive an eCredit for the unflown portion of the trip, or may instead request a cash refund for the unflown portion of the trip.

       " 'Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian apologized and offered frequent flyer miles to travelers for thousands of flight cancellations as the carrier struggled to recover from Friday’s globe-spanning IT outage, disruptions that sparked criticism from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The Atlanta-based airline canceled more than 4,600 flights from Friday through Sunday, more than any other airline, according to aviation data firm OAG. On Monday morning, Delta had already canceled another 700 flights, or 18% of its mainline operation, making up the vast majority of cancellations in the U.S. The delays and cancellations have put Delta in a rare spotlight for the carrier whose leaders pride themselves on reliability and punctuality. “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department,” Buttigieg said in an emailed statement late Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds” to customers who chose to call off their trips because of the disruptions as well as “timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The disruptions have persisted at Delta while most other carriers have recovered. American Airlines said it was almost back to normal by Saturday. United Airlines had elevated flight disruptions on Sunday with 9% of its schedule canceled, or 260 flights, according to FlightAware, but still below Delta’s. “I want to apologize to every one of you who have been impacted by these events,” Bastian said in a message to customers. “Delta is in the business of connecting the world, and we understand how difficult it can be when your travels are disrupted.” The airline was offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up shifts, a staff memo on Sunday said. The carrier called some of them on their personal phones to come in, according to a person familiar with the matter. High demand during some one of the busiest periods of summer challenged the airline to find alternative flights for affected travelers, Bastian said in his note. Delta Air Lines has a number of Microsoft tools that were impacted in the outage, “in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in his note. That would make the event similar to an issue Southwest Airlines suffered, on a much greater scale, at the end of 2022 when it failed to recover from severe winter weather for days.',\n",
       " 'Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week’s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 6 a.m. ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 383 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 18 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday. The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable U.S. airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday the remainder of the week are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In additional to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport, thousands of pieces of luggage were strewn about the baggage claim area, waiting to be reunited with passengers. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them.',\n",
       " 'U.S. regulators are investigating how Delta Air Lines is treating passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights as the airline struggles to recover from a global technology outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the Delta investigation on the X social media platform Tuesday “to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.” “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” Buttigieg said. Delta and its Delta Connection partners canceled close to 500 flights on Tuesday by midday on the East Coast, accounting for about two-thirds of all cancellations in the United States, according to FlightAware. The outage began Thursday night into Friday morning, after a faulty software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to more than 8 million Microsoft computers around the world. The Atlanta-based carrier has canceled more than 6,600 flights since the outage started, far more than any other airline, according to figures from FlightAware and travel-data provider Cirium. Delta said it was cooperating with the investigation. “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,” an airline spokesperson said in a statement. \"Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” Delta has said upward of half its technology systems run on Microsoft Windows, including a tool the airline uses to schedule pilots and flight attendants. That system could not keep up with the high number of changes triggered by the outage. The Transportation Department said it launched the investigation after seeing Delta\\'s continued widespread flight disruptions “and reports of concerning customer service failures.” The department said the investigation will evolve as it “processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” Investigators are likely to focus on whether Delta is complying with federal rules and offering prompt refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed. In a text provided to The Associated Press, a Delta passenger whose flight was canceled Saturday was told, “If you prefer not to rebook your trip, your ticket value will automatically be available as an eCredit that can be used towards a future Delta ticket.” This Delta Airlines passenger said she\\'s been on hold for more than six hours while waiting in line at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on July 23, 2024, days after the CrowdStrike global outage. (KOMO News) Delta’s meltdown mirrors that of Southwest Airlines, which canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 15 days in December 2022. A Transportation Department investigation ended with Southwest agreeing to pay a $35 million fine as part of a $140 million settlement. Southwest blamed its breakdown on a winter storm, but other airlines recovered in a couple days while Southwest did not. Consumer advocates see the same pattern with Delta this month — the airline continues to blame the CrowdStrike outage while rivals such as American recovered quickly, and even United Airlines, the second-worst at cancellations, was back on track Monday. “It\\'s not about the thing that caused the problem, it\\'s about how you recover from the problem. That\\'s the test of an airline,” said William McGee, a former aircraft dispatcher who is a consumer advocate at the American Economic Liberties Project, a group critical of large corporations.',\n",

Thousands of passengers are still being impacted by the global IT outage, most of which are Delta customers. Delta Airlines canceled at least 700 flights on Monday and nearly 4,800 more over the weekend, according to an AP report. Many travelers formed a long customer service line at Tampa International Airport because, for some of them, their jobs might depend on it. “I had the option of choosing American Airlines or another airline provider,” Delta TPA traveler Gregory Cook said. “I didn’t but I should have.” Cook is one of Delta’s many angry customers after his Monday flight got rescheduled to Wednesday. Delta addressed the issue on social media and has offered reimbursements for certain expenses caused as a result of the outage. “So unfortunately they can’t reimburse me right? I have to be somewhere today actually to install some equipment, right, so money won’t solve that issue,” Cook said. By noon on Monday, 16 of the 20 canceled flights at TPA were Delta, according to airport officials. Maricruz Quezada, flying American Airlines, dealt with a delay on Monday but her new flight wasn’t days away like many of the Delta travelers. Airport officials said weather also played a factor in some of Monday’s delays and cancelations. “I got work tomorrow and they canceled or changed my flight to next Monday,” Dunlap said. “Supposed to fly out today and then I’m flying out next Monday.” Dunlap said he was never notified of the change. After 8 On Your Side’s interview, Delta said they would update travelers about the status of their flights through their app or text message; however, their app is having complications because so many people are trying to use it.',\n",

He went on to say that “airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld.” Delta has canceled over 400 flights Tuesday, and that accounts for about two-thirds of all cancellations in the U.S., according to the Associated Press.

Frustrated passengers, long lines for customer service and images of travelers resting on airport concourse floors have been commonplace in recent days. \"We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and their customer service commitments,\" said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in announcing the investigation Tuesday, which \"will continue to evolve,\" the department said, as it processes a high volume of consumer complaints. Several U.S. airlines and many more globally were affected by Friday\\'s IT glitch at Austin-based CrowdStrike, which caused major problems for Microsoft clients. However, Delta\\'s problems have snowballed even as other U.S. carriers recovered. Delta has canceled more than 5,000 flights since Friday, per FlightAware data. Its cancellation rate has regularly topped 30% in recent days, far exceeding the 0.3% of flights it had previously canceled in 2024. In an update Monday, CEO Ed Bastian noted nearly half of the carrier\\'s global IT systems are Windows based, and required Delta staff to manually repair and reboot each machine, \"with additional time needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.\" The problems have caused particular problems with Delta\\'s critical crew-scheduling system, that helps the airline get crews to the right place at the right time. U.S. travelers know all too well how significantly crew scheduling software outages can affect air travel. Southwest Airlines\\' holiday 2022 meltdown was greatly exacerbated by problems with its crew scheduling systems, which caused mounting problems — and contributed to nearly 17,000 cancellations – following a December winter storm just before Christmas. \"It\\'s critical because you have to get the aircraft, the cabin crew, the flight crew, all at the right place at the right time in order for you to operate your schedule,\" explained Michael McCormick, a longtime Federal Aviation Administration veteran. \"When the system goes down ... you have to resort to manually trying to plan it,\" he explained. \"That\\'s requiring emails, texts, phone calls, all around the system in order to try to do that.\" In the eyes of McCormick, who now serves on the faculty at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, this recent outage — and the subsequent meltdown it triggered — should serve as a wakeup call for airlines. \"I think this highlights the need to have better firewalls, so, that\\'s cybersecurity, but in addition to that, redundancy and backup systems,\" McCormick said. \"[Airlines] have grown extraordinarily dependent upon automation, and as we saw — and continue to see — they cannot operate their flight schedules without that automation.\" Delta says it\\'s providing affected passengers with an option with flight credits for future use, or cash refunds for eligible travelers. You can submit a refund request at delta.com/refund. The airline also notes it\\'s providing stranded passengers with meals, hotel and ground transportation per its commitments listed on the Airline Customer Service Dashboard. Read more, here, on what you can do if you\\'re affected by Delta\\'s meltdown. In the meantime, Delta staff is working \"around the clock\" to get operations back on track, CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees Monday — a message that did leave uncertainty on when the problems might finally end.',\n",
       " 'The CrowdStrike outage that started late on Thursday is still causing havoc as Delta was forced to scrap an additional 1,250 flights yesterday on top of the 3,500 already cancelled, Reuters reported. That has left tens of thousands of Delta fliers stranded waiting for new flights that could take days, forcing many to cancel or postpone trips. The airline has yet to say when it will resume normal operations. Delta has scratched a third of scheduled flights for a total of 5,000 since Friday, and delayed another 1,700. \"In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\" said Delta CEO Ed Bastian. CrowdStrike\\'s software update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, causing many to go into a boot loop that could only be recovered by technicians with direct access to machines. The problem turned out to be a faulty sensor designed to detect malicious activity that \"triggered a logic error that resulted in an operating system crash,\" according to CrowdStrike. Delta was the worst hit of any US airline, and United Airlines was a distant second with about 266 (9 percent) of flights cancelled on Sunday. At first, United and Delta told stranded travelers that they wouldn\\'t cover bills since the CrowdStrike crash was out of their control. However, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg later stepped in and said that he considered the situation self-inflicted, so carriers would need to cover food, transportation and lodging costs for any delays longer than three hours as required by law. CrowdStrike said today that a \"significant\" number of devices are back online and the company is reportedly close to rolling out an automatic fix to the issue. Also heavily impacted by the outage are healthcare and other public services in the US and UK, with the NHS warning patients that \"there may still be some delays.\"',\n",
       " 'AUSTIN, Texas — Four days after a software update took down millions of computers around the world, Delta Airlines still hasn\\'t returned to normal operations, canceling hundreds more flights Monday.

I\\'ve been saying the exact same place for the last probably 25-30 minutes at least.\" The flight tracking service FlightAware shows Delta Airlines canceled more than a thousand flights Monday, marking a fourth straight day of the move. The airline is still struggling after a tech outage Friday caused by a faulty software update released by Austin-based Crowdstrike. While other airlines have managed to recover, CEO Ed Bastian says the glitch affected a tool Delta uses to track crews, causing a massive disruption during the high demand of summer travel. \"I just figured that we had enough of a cushion since that surge that it would work itself out, and apparently did for the other airlines, so I guess we\\'re just getting the short end of the stick,\" Lindsey said. According to CNN, Delta is offering crew members premium pay and assuring them they\\'ll be back home by the end of their work period. This is in place through Friday, meaning the problem may not be fixed for several more days. ALSO| Austin airport hit by widespread delays as software crash impacts airlines Delta declined to comment to CNN about these offers.

In a note to customers over the weekend, Bastian apologized for the delays and assured customers Delta would “continue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations, and transportation where available\" in addition to flight miles and travel vouchers.

About 16% of Delta\\'s flights had been canceled as of 5 a.m. MST, according to data from FlightAware, out of roughly 1,100 flights to or from the United States overall, the web site said. The issue has stranded thousands of Delta travelers across the United States, with some having to rent cars to drive hundreds of miles while others could have to wait days for new flights or cancel trips altogether. The Atlanta-based airline is battling operational issues after the outage hit its crew tracking system. Delta\\'s total number of canceled flights since Friday has exceeded 5,000. A Delta spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Although other U.S. airlines have largely recovered, Delta has struggled to return to normal. American Airlines had called off 1% of its flights on Monday, while United Airlines canceled less than 1%. Delta shares were little changed in premarket trading on Monday. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said over the weekend that the CrowdStrike issue affected its Microsoft Windows systems, snarling a critical application. \"One of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\" Bastian told customers in an email.

       " 'New York  — Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week’s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 8:30 am ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 420 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 18 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection. There were more than 400 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights. The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly. He asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation. “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,” he tweeted. “We will follow up.” The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday the remainder of the week are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In additional to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane. Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags. Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Busines Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did. He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he’s gotten from the airline so far.',\n",
       " \"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — The fallout from Friday's global IT outage is still causing a ripple effect. Many airlines are back to normal operations, except Delta Airlines. The Atlanta-based airline canceled over 800 flights today, and 1200 delayed Tuesday morning, leaving travelers in a frenzy. At Palm Beach International Airport, travelers experienced the same thing.

So far, everything is still up in the air. “Finally, when we got to talk to somebody they were able to rebook us on a flight from Atlanta to Cleveland but the one from here might still get canceled.,” she said. That’s because Delta canceled hundreds more flights early at their hub in Atlanta, as the problems from the global Microsoft outage continued into a fifth day. “Then we had 52 minutes to catch our connecting flight, but now it's delayed to 26 minutes,” said Robin Moody. The Ft. Pierce resident is flying to Michigan to be with family but the delays could cause her to miss her connecting flight in Detroit. “I’m a little nervy [sic], but I can get through that airport in about 10 seconds! I’m not worried about it too much and they may wait. There may be more than me waiting to catch that flight so maybe they’ll wait,” said Moody. There are visible reminders from Friday’s outage can be seen at PBIA, where dozens of bags are lined up awaiting the arrival of passengers stranded at other airports. Dozens of bags sit at Delta's baggage claim following Friday's IT outage that left many travelers stranded at other airports.

But some of his players and their equipment are still MIA. “10 kids whose flights got canceled.

       " 'The Department of Transportation is particularly concerned that Delta Air Lines is not adequately compensating passengers after canceling thousands of flights. The Department of Transportation is investigating Delta Air Lines over whether it\\'s \"following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions\" related to the CrowdStrike update mess, US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced today. The agency is particularly concerned that Delta is not adequately compensating passengers after canceling thousands of flights since the start of the outage on Friday, including 400 on Tuesday. Delta leads all airlines with the most cancellations and delays, according to FlightAware.  \"All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,\" Buttigieg said on X. In its defense, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on Monday: “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be.” It looks like the airline is struggling to restore systems partly because around half of its IT systems use Windows. PCs and servers installed with both the OS and Crowdstrike’s cybersecurity software ended up bricking and displaying the “Blue Screen of Death” after CrowdStrike accidentally sent out a faulty update.  Delta has since had to send staff to manually fix and restore each affected Windows IT system. Those same computers also need time to synchronize their applications. “One of Delta’s most critical systems—which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time—is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize,” Delta says. Delta has been offering affected consumers the chance to modify their flights free of charge or cancel a flight with a full refund. In addition, the airline says it’ll reimburse passengers for any meals or hotels they booked due to the disruptions.  CrowdStrike has published a new advisory and video with steps on restoring a Windows system. In the meantime, the Department of Transportation says airline passengers affected by the delays at Delta or other providers can contact them through a government complaint form.',\n",
       " 'The carrier also scrubbed hundreds of flights over the weekend after a defective software update knocked out computer systems worldwide. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 800 flights Monday as it struggled to recover from a global tech outage that rippled through the global economy four days earlier, even while other airlines and some major health-care organizations largely returned to normal. The Atlanta-based carrier had already scuttled hundreds of flights after a software update Friday knocked out computer systems worldwide, sparking widespread disruptions at airports, hospitals and an array of other businesses. On Sunday alone, Delta recorded more than 1,300 cancellations and about 1,600 delays, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Delta has been the subject of hundreds of complaints filed with the U.S. Transportation Department over “continued disruptions and unacceptable customer service conditions,” according to a social media post Sunday from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “I have made clear to Delta that we will hold them to all applicable passenger protections,” Buttigieg said. In a Sunday blog post, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said that the outage had affected an important tool related to crew tracking and that it was unable to effectively process the “unprecedented” number of changes triggered by the system shutdown. “Our teams have been working around-the-clock to recover and restore full functionality,” Bastian wrote. The outage has taken a bigger toll on Delta than its rivals. It scrubbed 1,200 flights Friday, while United Airlines canceled 649 flights, American Airlines scrapped 408 and Spirit Airlines cut 234. All told, there were about 46,000 flights canceled worldwide Friday, according to FlightAware. As of midafternoon Monday, the number of total worldwide cancellations had fallen to about 1,500. The Transportation Department said in a statement that airlines aside from Delta have “largely been able to recover.” Windows-controlled medical devices, medical records, pharmacy orders and more were affected, he noted, adding that more and more hospitals had installed CrowdStrike in the past few years because of the devastation wreaked by ransomware gangs. The problems with airline staffing tools drew comparisons to the 2022 Christmas meltdown at Southwest Airlines, which canceled or significantly delayed about 16,900 flights, disrupting the travel plans of 2 million people, according to a Transportation Department investigation. In that case, a winter storm spiraled into a broader staffing crisis as the airline’s system for matching crew members with aircraft couldn’t keep up. The agency ultimately fined Southwest $140 million over its handling of the crisis. Delta said Monday that it had communicated directly with customers, offering them an apology along with SkyMiles program miles or a travel voucher. It also offered to cover certain expenses through meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and ground transportation. Additionally, the carrier extended a travel waiver allowing previously scheduled fliers to rebook their flights free. The Transportation Department has emphasized that Delta must inform its customers that they are entitled to a refund if they choose not to travel. The department lists each airline’s customer service commitments in the event of “controllable” cancellations and delays on the website flightrights.gov.',\n",

By Monday evening, Delta had already canceled another 900 flights, or 23% of its mainline operation, making up most of the day’s cancellations in the U.S., according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The delays and cancellations have put Delta in a rare spotlight for the carrier whose leaders pride themselves on reliability and punctuality, and who market the airline as a premium carrier. “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department,” Buttigieg said in an emailed statement late Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds” to customers who chose to call off their trips because of the disruptions as well as “timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The disruptions have persisted at Delta while most other carriers have recovered. American Airlines\\nsaid it was almost back to normal by Saturday. United Airlines\\nhad elevated flight disruptions on Sunday with 9% of its schedule canceled, or 260 flights, according to FlightAware, but still below Delta’s. “I want to apologize to every one of you who have been impacted by these events,” Bastian said in a message to customers over the weekend. The airline was offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up shifts, a staff memo on Sunday said. The carrier called some of them on their personal phones to come in, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. High demand during some one of the busiest periods of summer challenged the airline to find alternative flights for affected travelers, Bastian said in his note. On Sunday, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth forecast a financial hit of more than $160 million for Delta. Delta has a number of Microsoft\\ntools that were impacted in the outage, “in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in his note. That would make the event similar to an issue Southwest Airlines\\nsuffered, on a much greater scale, at the end of 2022 when it failed to recover from severe winter weather for days.',\n",
       " 'ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines canceled more than 600 flights on Monday, as the U.S. air carrier continued to struggle to restore operations after last week\\'s global cyber outage, even as other airlines were recovering from the incident. About 16% of Delta\\'s flights had been canceled as of 5 a.m. MST, according to data from FlightAware, out of roughly 1,100 flights to or from the United States overall, the web site said. The issue has stranded thousands of Delta travelers across the United States, with some having to rent cars to drive hundreds of miles while others could have to wait days for new flights or cancel trips altogether. The Atlanta-based airline is battling operational issues after the outage hit its crew tracking system. Delta\\'s total number of canceled flights since Friday has exceeded 5,000. A Delta spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Although other U.S. airlines have largely recovered, Delta has struggled to return to normal. American Airlines had called off 1% of its flights on Monday, while United Airlines canceled less than 1%. Delta shares were little changed in premarket trading on Monday. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said over the weekend that the CrowdStrike issue affected its Microsoft Windows systems, snarling a critical application. \"One of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\" Bastian told customers in an email.

       " 'U.S. airline regulators have opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, which is still struggling to restore operations on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, more than four full days after a faulty software update caused technological havoc worldwide and disrupted global air travel. Here, a Delta Air Lines plane leaves the gate on July 12, 2021, at Logan International Airport in Boston. Travelers, be sure to pack some patience. Chaos is still underway with Delta Air Lines, as the airline has entered its fifth day of flight cancelations and delays following Friday’s global software outage. And while the Atlanta-based carrier is still trying to get operations in order, the U.S. Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into the recent flight disruptions, citing “the high volume of consumer complaints” the department has received against Delta. “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement Tuesday. “This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law, and our department will leverage the full extent of our investigative and enforcement power to ensure the rights of Delta’s passengers are upheld,\" he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, Delta had canceled more than 400 flights and delayed roughly 860 flights for the day, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. In a statement to NPR, Delta Air Lines acknowledged the Department of Transportation’s notice of the investigation and said it is \"fully cooperating\" with the department. \"We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,\" the airline said in its statement, adding that teams are constantly working to get its operations back to normal. On Monday, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that the airline has been working to restore the software that tracks and schedules its flight crews. However, he noted that it may take a few days to fully restore the airline’s operations. In a public letter Sunday, Delta offered travel waivers to customers on flights impacted by the outage, allowing them to change itineraries and rebook their flights without any added fees. But in a post on X, Buttigieg said that under new federal regulations, customers are not obligated to accept the travel credit offered to rebook flights but are entitled to a prompt cash refund. \"Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance,\" he wrote. Millions of Microsoft users worldwide were knocked offline following a flawed software update from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity group. CrowdStrike said the problem was not a cyberattack but a \"software glitch.\" After identifying the issue, the company said it withdrew the \"problematic channel file\" that affected customers\\' systems. Delta’s technical issues are comparable to those that occurred with Southwest Airlines during the 2022 holiday travel season. The Dallas-based airline canceled thousands of flights and left millions of travelers stranded. Following the incident, the U.S. Transportation Department ordered Southwest to pay $140 million in a civil penalty, which was by far the largest the DOT has ever levied for consumers, the department said in a statement announcing the penalty.',\n",

That’s because Delta canceled hundreds more flights early at their hub in Atlanta, as the problems from the global Microsoft outage continued into a fifth day. “Then we had 52 minutes to catch our connecting flight, but now it's delayed to 26 minutes,” said Robin Moody.

It comes a day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called out Delta for the lingering cancelations and delays from Friday’s outage. A bug in the security software CrowdStrike shut down computer systems globally on Friday, with airlines being one of the most affected industries.  Delta was the only airline to still have a significant number of cancelations and delays as of Monday, after it canceled more than 1,300 flights on Sunday and about 1,200 each Friday and Saturday. “We have received reports of continued disruptions and unacceptable customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with U.S. DOT,” Buttigieg wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we will hold them to all applicable passenger protections.” He also called on the airline to provide proper refunds and hotel accommodations for stranded passengers. “No one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent,” Buttigieg wrote. Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized to customers in a statement Sunday, saying the airline was hit especially hard by the tech outage because it relies on CrowdStrike-affected computer systems for its crew management software. “Cancellations continue on Sunday as Delta’s teams work to recover our systems and restore our operation.

While nearly every airline in the United States was impacted by the outage, Delta Airlines appeared to be the only airline still navigating major issues connected to the outage at Denver International Airport by Monday.  On the fifth level baggage claim area, only Delta had thousands of luggage bags scattered around their claim. \"I was a little nervous when I walked up and saw the sea of luggage,\" said Amy Clifton, a Delta customer.  Clifton and her husband were in Colorado on business and then vacation. They purchased flights home to Atlanta via Delta with the hope of being home by Monday afternoon. However, Delta\\'s system and lack of available staffing have snowballed into a third consecutive day of major cancellations.  \"I heard a worker say the bags behind us have been here for a few days,* Clifton told CBS News Colorado\\'s Dillon Thomas.  Unlike many, the Clifton\\'s quickly reclaimed their bags even after checking them in.

More:New airline refund rule could get you money back for delayed flights The outage, said to have been caused by a faulty update by cyber security firm CrowdStrike that impacted Microsoft’s Windows Operating System, hit major airlines and infrastructure but Delta was one airline still seeing major flight disruptions as of Tuesday. And social media users were calling out the airline, saying it was not properly supporting their efforts to get home or get a place to stay or food until they can. Detroit wasn’t the airport experiencing the most misery for cancellations and delays for all airlines as of about 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to FlightAware. That was Atlanta’s airport. But Detroit had seen 132 cancellations in the last 24 hours, with 26 flights originating from Detroit canceled and 52 delayed on Tuesday. Delta had more than 400 cancellations, not specific to Detroit, by 9 a.m. Tuesday and in the time since the outage had canceled more flights than it canceled for half of 2023, USA Today reported. Buttigieg, in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, said his department is probing to make sure the law is followed and that Delta is “taking care of its passengers” as the disruptions continue.   “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” he said. He encouraged customers to try to resolve issues directly with the airline, but offered a link to file complaints for those who believe Delta is not following passenger protection requirements. In a statement provided to the Free Press, Delta acknowledged the investigation and said it was cooperating: “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable. Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.”     Flight delayed for hours?How to figure out when you get can a refund or rebooked. Delta, in a news release Monday, said upward of half of its IT systems worldwide are Windows-based and require manual repairs and rebooting. It also stated its system that makes sure full crews are available at the right place and time requires the most time and manual support. The company promised a travel waiver from July 19-23, a refund upon request, travel vouchers, coverage of eligible expense including meals, hotels and ground transportation, and rebooking options. It also stated that the company does not reimburse prepaid expenses, including hotel reservations at a customer’s destination, lost wages or event tickets. Jeff Fargo, his 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son are some of the customers left stranded in Detroit. The family was on their way to return home to Las Vegas after a 10-day stay in upstate New York visiting Fargo’s parents when their typical layover at DTW turned into a living nightmare. The three arrived in Detroit around 7:30 p.m. Monday night when they received news that their continuing flight had been rescheduled and later cancelled. After waiting in line at Delta’s customer service desk for 45 minutes, Fargo says he was told that the company would not be offering vouchers or reimbursement for hotel stays, food and other surprise expenses. Anxious to get his kids and himself home, Fargo said he looked at renting a car to drive from Detroit to Las Vegas, only to find that businesses in the metro Detroit area aren’t allowing for one-way car rentals. As of Tuesday afternoon, Fargo found a Southwest flight that could get his family home, but not after forcing Fargo to cancel the filming of an episode of his podcast as well as other work meetings, leaving him and his children with no clean clothes, and causing withdrawal symptoms without access to the medications that Fargo has been taking for years. After Ubering to TJ Maxx and a grocery stores from hotel to buy him and his children some clean clothes, Fargo says the repercussions of the flight failure is in the hundreds of dollars – most of which he says he doesn’t think will be returned from Delta. “Luckily I have the means to take care of myself and my children, but what if I didn’t?” he said. “It would’ve been Delta’s fault for compromising the safety and wellness of my family.” Before the delay, Fargo had Delta silver medallion status, and had already spent enough money on flights this year to qualify for silver medallion next year. But now, Fargo says he’d rather walk than buy a ticket with Delta. “I will never fly Delta again, even if they offer me a trip around the world for free,” he said.',\n",

The massive global tech outage that hit individuals and companies on Friday is still disrupting global air travels days later. On Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta Air Lines to ensure that Delta is following the law and following newly-established passenger protections. The protections mean that if passengers’ flights are canceled, they can get a refund if they choose not to travel. It also means the passengers get a refund if the flight is significantly delayed. Additionally, baggage fees are supposed to be returned if a passenger’s bags are lost. Buttigieg’s post on X also instructed airline passengers to try and resolve problems directly with the airline first. If that doesn’t work, then file a complaint with the DOT. The DOT also has a list on its website of what different airlines are committed to do for passengers in case of a problem. Buttigieg wrote in a statement late Sunday night, “Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancelations.” Delta has canceled more than 4,000 flights since Friday. Most airlines have recovered from Friday\\'s outage, but Delta has been especially hard hit, leaving some stranded for days. Jerry Matthews told WRAL News he was traveling to Tampa with a family of 17 people for vacation when he got stranded at the airport. \"We went online and tried to find a flight to Tampa … nothing’s available,\" he said. Many Delta passengers said they had to book with other airlines to reach their final destinations. On Monday, the airline said it would cover or reimburse for meal vouchers and hotels. It also said all customers who booked flights between July 19 to 23 will be able to change their itineraries once or get a refund. Delta executives previously said remedying this issue would take days. For Skip Horne, who has been recovering from back surgery, it’s been a pain – literally. Horne\\'s flight on Monday was canceled, and there was not another available flight until Tuesday, leaving him waiting 24 hours inside RDU. \"What choice do I have?\" Horne said. \"I already checked out of my hotel, I have nowhere to go.

       " 'Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week’s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 2pm ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 466 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 28 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection. There were more than 1,000 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights. The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly. The DOT said it has received a “high volume of consumer complaints” about Delta’s actions since Friday. The department said if can penalize an airline for “an unfair and deceptive practice” if it finds finds that an airline provided inadequate customer assistance when flights are canceled or travel plans significantly changed. Buttigieg asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation. “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,” he tweeted. “We will follow up.” Delta said it cooperating with the investigation. RELATED ARTICLE\\nWhat Delta passengers are entitled to in terms of compensation “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation,” the company told CNN in a statement. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. Jeremy and Kaylee Jones were married on Saturday and left Spokane, Washington Monday for their honeymoon, they told CNN. Five guests weren’t able to attend the wedding due to flight issues. They arrived in Atlanta early Tuesday morning for a connecting flight from Atlanta to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. There were no issues with the flights until they landed in Atlanta this morning and saw the flight to St. Lucia was cancelled due to a lack of crew. The next Delta flight to St. Lucia is not until Friday, so they are canceling their honeymoon. The only other option is to be re-routed to other airports, which they believe will have the same problem, and they still don’t have their luggage. “I’m thinking the domino effect of flight cancellations are causing people to be stuck here for 5 days. I have no confidence in getting anywhere at this point.” This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In addition to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane. Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags. Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Business Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did. He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he’s gotten from the airline so far.',\n",

Several U.S. airlines and many more globally were affected by Friday\\'s IT glitch at Austin-based CrowdStrike, which caused major problems for Microsoft clients. However, Delta\\'s problems have snowballed even as other U.S. carriers recovered. Delta has canceled more than 5,000 flights since Friday, per FlightAware data. Its cancellation rate has regularly topped 30% in recent days, far exceeding the 0.3% of flights it had previously canceled in 2024. In an update Monday, CEO Ed Bastian noted nearly half of the carrier\\'s global IT systems are Windows based, and required Delta staff to manually repair and reboot each machine, \"with additional time needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.\" The problems have caused particular problems with Delta\\'s critical crew-scheduling system, that helps the airline get crews to the right place at the right time. U.S. travelers know all too well how significantly crew scheduling software outages can affect air travel. Southwest Airlines\\' holiday 2022 meltdown was greatly exacerbated by problems with its crew scheduling systems, which caused mounting problems — and contributed to nearly 17,000 cancellations – following a December winter storm just before Christmas. \"It\\'s critical because you have to get the aircraft, the cabin crew, the flight crew, all at the right place at the right time in order for you to operate your schedule,\" explained Michael McCormick, a longtime Federal Aviation Administration veteran. \"When the system goes down ... you have to resort to manually trying to plan it,\" he explained. \"That\\'s requiring emails, texts, phone calls, all around the system in order to try to do that.\" In the eyes of McCormick, who now serves on the faculty at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, this recent outage — and the subsequent meltdown it triggered — should serve as a wakeup call for airlines. \"I think this highlights the need to have better firewalls, so, that\\'s cybersecurity, but in addition to that, redundancy and backup systems,\" McCormick said. \"[Airlines] have grown extraordinarily dependent upon automation, and as we saw — and continue to see — they cannot operate their flight schedules without that automation.\" Delta says it\\'s providing affected passengers with an option with flight credits for future use, or cash refunds for eligible travelers. You can submit a refund request at delta.com/refund. The airline also notes it\\'s providing stranded passengers with meals, hotel and ground transportation per its commitments listed on the Airline Customer Service Dashboard. Read more, here, on what you can do if you\\'re affected by Delta\\'s meltdown. In the meantime, Delta staff is working \"around the clock\" to get operations back on track, CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees Monday — a message that did leave uncertainty on when the problems might finally end.',\n",

       " 'AUSTIN, Texas — Four days after a software update took down millions of computers around the world, Delta Airlines still hasn\\'t returned to normal operations, canceling hundreds more flights Monday. That includes many flights at Austin Bergstrom International Airport. At a bursting customer service line, frustration was mounting. \"We\\'re just helpless, really,\" Austinite and Delta customer Sarah Lindsey said. \"And it\\'s not moving. I\\'ve been saying the exact same place for the last probably 25-30 minutes at least.\" The flight tracking service FlightAware shows Delta Airlines canceled more than a thousand flights Monday, marking a fourth straight day of the move. The airline is still struggling after a tech outage Friday caused by a faulty software update released by Austin-based Crowdstrike. While other airlines have managed to recover, CEO Ed Bastian says the glitch affected a tool Delta uses to track crews, causing a massive disruption during the high demand of summer travel. \"I just figured that we had enough of a cushion since that surge that it would work itself out, and apparently did for the other airlines, so I guess we\\'re just getting the short end of the stick,\" Lindsey said. According to CNN, Delta is offering crew members premium pay and assuring them they\\'ll be back home by the end of their work period. This is in place through Friday, meaning the problem may not be fixed for several more days. ALSO| Austin airport hit by widespread delays as software crash impacts airlines Delta declined to comment to CNN about these offers. Lindsey and her husband shelled out money for new tickets with another airline so they could still get to Boston on Monday for a family vacation. \"It was either, you know, the trip is gonna have to be sacrificed in some way, or we\\'re gonna have to pay a lot of money,\" Lindsey said. In a note to customers over the weekend, Bastian apologized for the delays and assured customers Delta would “continue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations, and transportation where available\" in addition to flight miles and travel vouchers. Both women just hope the issue is resolved soon, for both their sakes and the employees. \"I feel bad for the flight attendants. I\\'m sure they\\'re getting snapped out really bad too,\" Smith said. \"It doesn\\'t sound like a good time to be in customer service for Delta.\"',\n",
       " 'TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — Some Tampa travelers feel stuck as they try to get past the travel nightmare that began Friday. Thousands of passengers are still being impacted by the global IT outage, most of which are Delta customers. Delta Airlines canceled at least 700 flights on Monday and nearly 4,800 more over the weekend, according to an AP report. Many travelers formed a long customer service line at Tampa International Airport because, for some of them, their jobs might depend on it. “I had the option of choosing American Airlines or another airline provider,” Delta TPA traveler Gregory Cook said. “I didn’t but I should have.” Cook is one of Delta’s many angry customers after his Monday flight got rescheduled to Wednesday. Delta addressed the issue on social media and has offered reimbursements for certain expenses caused as a result of the outage. “So unfortunately they can’t reimburse me right? I have to be somewhere today actually to install some equipment, right, so money won’t solve that issue,” Cook said. By noon on Monday, 16 of the 20 canceled flights at TPA were Delta, according to airport officials. Maricruz Quezada, flying American Airlines, dealt with a delay on Monday but her new flight wasn’t days away like many of the Delta travelers. Airport officials said weather also played a factor in some of Monday’s delays and cancelations. “I got work tomorrow and they canceled or changed my flight to next Monday,” Dunlap said. “Supposed to fly out today and then I’m flying out next Monday.” Dunlap said he was never notified of the change. After 8 On Your Side’s interview, Delta said they would update travelers about the status of their flights through their app or text message; however, their app is having complications because so many people are trying to use it.',\n",

And Delta\\'s hub of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport has been particularly hard-hit. If you\\'ve already been affected by the chaos, or are planning travel on Delta soon, you may have options. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg made it clear in an X posting on Sunday night: \"Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays.\" On Tuesday, Delta extended its travel waiver for all passengers with scheduled departures through July 28. The waiver allows you to reschedule your flight for anytime through Aug. 4 in the same class of service without paying any change fee (in the case of Basic Economy tickets) or a fare difference. If you rebook your flight for after Aug. 4, any change fee is waived, but you would still pay the fare difference. If you\\'re unable the reschedule at this time, Delta\\'s waiver allows you to cancel your reservation and apply the value to a future travel credit, to be used within one year of when you bought your original ticket. But it may be worth waiting to see if Delta cancels your flight first (see below). If Delta\\'s scheduling problems continue, we may see the eligible dates for this waiver extended, so stay tuned if you have travel coming later in the week. Of course, all airlines would like you accept a voucher or credit, for use on their own metal, when your flight is canceled or delayed. But that often obscures the important thing for consumers: If an airline cancels or significantly changes your flight — and you don\\'t accept an alternative flight — you are entitled to a full cash refund. A \"significant change\" would include departing or arriving more than three hours late, or a change of airport or in the number of connections, according to the Department of Transportation. Delta\\'s own guidelines are better: They allow you to cancel and receive a refund to your original form of payment after a more than 120-minute delay. To get started on a cancellation and refund, go to delta.com/refund-form. If your travel nightmare has led to additional meal, transportation and lodging expenses, save your receipts. As indicated by Buttigieg, airlines must reimburse for such necessary expenses in the case of a cancellation or significant delay under the airline\\'s control. But Delta says it will not reimburse for \"other airline tickets, prepaid expenses, including hotels and activities at your destination, or lost wages.\" Delta\\'s reimbursement request form is at delta.com/reimbursement.

       " 'ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - The chaos continues at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as Delta Air Lines works to fully bounce back following the global IT outage from a software defect on Friday that caused thousands of flight cancellations and delays. As other carriers have returned to normal, Delta’s meltdown could continue for another few days. Some travelers say they have been stranded at the Atlanta airport for five days now with no end in sight. Delta says it’s working with an impaired crew tracking system, which has caused major hiccups in the recovery process. Nearly 200 Delta flights have already been canceled for Tuesday, according to FlightAware, and mass amounts of luggage are missing. Thousands of unclaimed suitcases have filled Delta’s baggage claim centers globally, including in Atlanta. >> HOW TO GET REIMBURSED BY DELTA “The bags went without us. Went to Newark. They wouldn’t let us board the plane,” traveler Roderick Taylor said. “Our plane never came in. It kept getting canceled, canceled. We stayed here for about 15 to 16 hours on Friday, because we couldn’t get on the plane. Just wondering why if we couldn’t get on the plane, why would you take our luggage to Newark and we couldn’t go? It was so frustrating.” Taylor was heading up north for a cruise with his wife and a group of friends. However, he never made it. “It’s my first time ever going through this at the airport,” Taylor said. “It was total chaos. People everywhere. People laying everywhere, sleeping everywhere. It was like being around a homeless shelter.” Taylor’s wife, Marcellia, spent the last few days with her eyes glued on Delta’s luggage tracker and her ears bonded to her phone. “Kept calling and calling. Couldn’t get through. So finally, yesterday, I got through,” she said. “I held on the phone for like five hours to get someone to get a file number to get my luggage sent from Newark back to Atlanta.” While some passengers have been frustrated, other flyers say they understand. “Delta has really taken care of us. They’ve been really good for us,” traveler Shawn Mohr said. “I would say take a deep breath. Let people do their job. These folks are professionals and let them be professionals. Be courteous. Because they’re here plenty more hours than we are, and they feel what we’re going through.” Meanwhile, the United States of Transportation (DOT) has opened an investigation into Delta’s handling of the outage. “U.S. DOT has opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions. All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. Delta officials said the company is working around the clock to recover. They’ve added dozens of staff in baggage claim areas to help expedite the return of all bags as soon as possible. Airline officials said customers should use the process found on this page to reclaim their missing bags. “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable. Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta,” the company’s statement reads.

The US Department of Transportation has received hundreds of complaints about the airline since Friday, when the cybersecurity company launched a faulty software update that brought down Microsoft systems globally, impacting retailers and top airlines. While most airlines have since recovered, Delta is still working to get back on track. According to FlightAware, a commercial flight tracker, the company was leading the number of delays and cancellations at 779 and 460 on Tuesday. “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees on Monday. “Keep taking great care of our customers and each other in the coming days.” The airline explained that more than half of Delta IT systems worldwide are Windows-based. The error required the company’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems. One of Delta’s most critical systems, which makes sure all flights have a full crew, requires the most time and manual support to synchronize. The DOT confirmed the investigation in a statement to The Independent. “This process will continue to evolve as DOT learns more and processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg added: “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments. This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law. In a statement responding to the investigation, the airline said: “Delta is in receipt of the Department’s notice of investigation and is fully cooperating.” The House Homeland Security Committee has called on CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz to testify over the incident, which brought airline operations to a standstill and left billboards in Times Square blank on Friday.

The lines at Delta Airlines counters remain long at Sea-Tac. The airline has canceled more than a third of its scheduled flights today alone. Nearly 17 hundred other flights have been delayed. Some passengers are telling you they are booking flights on other airlines. They say they have no other choice, especially since most other airlines are flying. This is after a glitch in software used around the world grounded five airlines late last week. But as you can see, Delta’s passengers are dealing with the brunt of it. These are Delta passengers, still stranded at Sea-Tac, some since late last week, because of a technology outage that grounded aircraft across the globe. “They took forever to put the bags on the crew timed out,” said Luann Lenz. She says that was yesterday. And they are still stuck at Sea-Tac. “We rebooked on United on our own,” Lenz said, “‘cause Delta didn’t have anything. We’re trying to get to Raleigh-Durham.

       " 'Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week’s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 6 a.m. ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 383 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 18 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday. The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable U.S. airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday the remainder of the week are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In additional to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport, thousands of pieces of luggage were strewn about the baggage claim area, waiting to be reunited with passengers. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them.',\n",

It was going to be very tight and then when we got to JFK we sat on the runway for 40 minutes. And so they still told us we were going to make it if we ran for it,\" Jamie Paulen said. Paulen from Raleigh was on her way to relaxing vacation in Iceland. Or so she thought, until the layover from hell at JFK. It was midnight. She and her kids were the first ones off the plane. They sprinted to their connection. \"We got there and they just shut the gate. So they told us that I had to get in line. So I waited in line for 3 hours and they booked us on another flight but she didn\\'t tell me that we were going to Newark. So I actually almost went to JFK,\" she said. She\\'s among the Delta Airlines customers living in a travel nightmare. The airline is struggling to bounce back from the Microsoft computer outage. The disruptions have dragged into the fifth day. \"My flight was supposed to be 6 o\\'clock this morning. I\\'m from Long Island and I was supposed to leave from JFK. I had to rebook to Philadelphia and now I\\'m here in Newark,\" Donyshia Boston-Hill said. Other airlines got back to normal by the weekend but Delta had to cancel 1,100 flights on Monday, which was more than a quarter of its flights. Hundreds more were canceled on Tuesday. More than 7-thousand in all since Friday. The airline\\'s CEO says it will take a few more days to resolve the issues. The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched an investigation into Delta Airlines, Secretary Pete Buttigieg says, \"to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.\" Delta says it is fully cooperating and working tirelessly to make it right for customers. \"There\\'s been a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of issues with delta at this point,\" traveler Steve Mansor said. Mansor would rather see less words, and more action from Delta. He was considering renting a car to drive back home to Detroit from Newark after his 1:00 p.m. flight was canceled. \"The only later flight that I saw was 8:20 and I don\\'t want to risk having to stay at the airport because hotels are booked,\" Mansor said. The outage happened on the busiest weekend of the summer for Delta. The airline says customers who\\'ve incurred hotel, meal, or transportation expenses may be eligible for reimbursement. Delta\\'s meltdown mirrors that of Southwest Airlines, which canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 15 days in December 2022. A Transportation Department investigation ended with Southwest agreeing to pay a $35 million fine as part of a $140 million settlement. Southwest blamed its breakdown on a winter storm, but other airlines recovered in a couple days while Southwest did not. Consumer advocates see the same pattern with Delta this month - the airline continues to blame the CrowdStrike outage while rivals such as American recovered quickly, and even United Airlines, the second-worst at cancellations, was back on track Monday.',\n",
       " 'FILE - A Delta Air Lines plane leaves the gate on July 12, 2021, at Logan International Airport in Boston. U.S. airline regulators have opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines, which is still struggling to restore operations on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, more than four full days after a faulty software update caused technological havoc worldwide and disrupted global air travel. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) U.S. regulators are investigating how Delta Air Lines is treating passengers affected by canceled and delayed flights as the airline struggles to recover from a global technology outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the Delta investigation on the X social media platform Tuesday “to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.” “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,” Buttigieg said. Delta and its Delta Connection partners canceled about 500 flights on Tuesday by midday on the East Coast, accounting for about two-thirds of all cancellations in the United States, according to trackng platform FlightAware. The outage began Thursday night into Friday morning, after a faulty software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to more than 8 million Microsoft computers around the world. The Atlanta-based carrier has canceled more than 6,600 flights since the outage started, far more than any other airline, according to figures from FlightAware and travel-data provider Cirium. Delta said it was cooperating with the investigation. “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,” an airline spokesperson said in a statement. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” Delta has said upward of half its technology systems run on Microsoft Windows, including a tool the airline uses to schedule pilots and flight attendants. The systems could not keep up with the high number of changes triggered by the outage. The collapse at Delta is stunning for an outfit that was widely viewed as the best big U.S. airline – the most profitable before and after the pandemic, and the best-run operation. Delta has almost always ranked near the top among all U.S. carriers for on-time performance. The Transportation Department said it launched the investigation after seeing Delta’s continued widespread flight disruptions “and reports of concerning customer service failures.” The department said the investigation will evolve as it “processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” Investigators are likely to focus on whether Delta is complying with federal rules and offering prompt refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed. In a text provided to The Associated Press, a Delta passenger whose flight was canceled Saturday was told, “If you prefer not to rebook your trip, your ticket value will automatically be available as an eCredit that can be used towards a future Delta ticket.” In Washington, lawmakers are beginning to weigh in.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., chair of the Senate committee that oversees airlines, said in a letter to Delta CEO Ed Bastian that she is “concerned” that Delta is not complying with passenger rights contained in a law that Congress passed in May. “While the technology outage was clearly not caused by Delta or any airline, I am nevertheless concerned that Delta is failing to meet the moment and adequately protect the needs of passengers,” Cantwell wrote. Delta’s meltdown mirrors that of Southwest Airlines, which canceled nearly 17,000 flights over 15 days in December 2022. A Transportation Department investigation ended with Southwest agreeing to pay a $35 million fine as part of a $140 million settlement. Southwest blamed its breakdown on a winter storm, but other airlines recovered in a couple days while Southwest did not. Consumer advocates see the same pattern with Delta this month — the airline continues to blame the CrowdStrike outage while rivals such as American recovered quickly. Even United Airlines, the second-worst at cancellations, was back on track Monday. “It’s not about the thing that caused the problem, it’s about how you recover from the problem. That’s the test of an airline,” said William McGee, a former aircraft dispatcher who is a consumer advocate at the American Economic Liberties Project, a group critical of large corporations.',\n",
       " 'The US has opened an investigation into Delta Airlines as it struggles to recover from last week\\'s global IT outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Delta must provide passengers with refunds and other compensation for disrupted travel as required by law. A day earlier, Delta, which has cancelled more than 5,000 flights since Friday, signalled it could take several more days for operations to return to normal. It added: \"Recognising that Americans will undoubtedly feel the lasting, real-world consequences of this incident, they deserve to know in detail how this incident happened and the mitigation steps CrowdStrike is taking.” CrowdStrike said it was working on ways to make it easier and faster to fix the issue, which downed an estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices globally, hitting airlines, health systems and other services. In many cases, IT teams had to reboot computers manually. Delta, which appears to have had more difficulty recovering than other airlines, said that its crew-staffing system had been affected by the incident. As of Tuesday morning, it had already cancelled more than 400 flights and delayed hundreds of others, following more than 1,150 cancellations a day earlier, according to tracking firm Flight Aware. \"All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld,\" Mr Buttigieg wrote on social media. \"While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up.\" The Biden administration in April finalised a rule requiring that airlines promptly and automatically refund passengers for significant changes to their travel, and other issues. It is part of a broader effort to step up policing of airlines after a series of major travel meltdowns. Last year, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $140m (£108m) resolve a Department of Transportation investigation launched after a storm disrupted service and set off a cascade of cancellations during the busy 2022 holiday travel period. The passenger has called for the States to stop defending the airline over delays and cancellation About 200 passengers destined for Cardiff have been trapped in Spain for days after cancellations. The airline said cost-concious customers were being \"more frugal and cautious\". If you face disruption because flights are cancelled or delayed you could be entitled to help.',\n",
       " \"Hundreds of thousands of travelers have been stranded by Delta flight cancellations, and many have to wait for hours to get assistance from the airline. Here’s what travelers should be aware of if their Delta flight is canceled. If the airline cancels or significantly delays your flight, you are entitled to a prompt refund if you don’t want to be rebooked on another flight, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. If your flight is canceled or significantly delayed and you don’t want to be rebooked and you instead want a refund, you can go to delta.com/refund to apply for a refund. Delta said it is “notifying customers about delays and cancellations in their itinerary via the Fly Delta app and text message, and offering rebooking options that can be managed online.” But it also acknowledged that its Fly Delta app and Delta’s website have had spotty service, being overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of customers trying to get help. That’s making it difficult for customers to get information about their flights or rebooking. “Delta teams are working to stabilize those tools,” the airline said. Delta customers have encountered more frustrations trying to get assistance from Delta, with some waiting for hours at airports to get rebooked or to get their checked bags back, while others wait hours for responses from Delta customer service on the phone or through messaging. Many have tried reaching out to Delta on social media. Delta said it will cover “eligible expenses” resulting from the flight disruption. The airline said it is “providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation” — but many passengers say they were not offered vouchers or hotels. Another way for stranded passengers to get compensation for their extra expenses is to file for reimbursement from Delta. “Customers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement,” Delta said. However, Delta said it “does not reimburse prepaid expenses, including but not limited to hotel reservations at the customer’s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, concerts or other tickets.” Delta said it is also issuing SkyMiles or a travel voucher, with the amount based on how much the passenger was affected during that time. Many people with flights scheduled on Delta last weekend and this week have worried about whether they’ll also get caught up in the mass flight cancellations. This has been a reality for thousands of people who ended up stuck after their trips were disrupted. But many others have managed to get on flights that were not canceled. Some travel experts have advised travelers to avoid flying Delta while the airline’s operation remains dysfunctional and beleaguered with a backlog of thousands of stranded passengers trying to get home or to their destinations. Delta encouraged this by issuing a travel waiver allowing people with flights booked for a certain period starting Friday, July 19, to change their travel plans without paying a higher fare, with certain conditions. The waiver has been extended multiple times, and it was recently extended to last through Tuesday, July 23. Some who have had flights canceled or are worried about the prospect have considered alternate transportation options, such as renting a car or taking a refund from Delta and looking for an alternate flight on another airline. In a video message to employees on Monday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian signaled that he expects a full recovery to still take some time. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating Delta over the meltdown and its treatment of passengers. The agency says Delta is legally obligated to care for its passengers and adhere to its commitments to customers. Buttigieg said he has “made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The DOT said the Delta cancellations and delays are considered “controllable,” triggering a higher degree of commitments for handling passengers whose flights are disrupted. On Tuesday, Buttigieg posted on social media platform X: “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up.” He directed travelers to the DOT’s online air travel service complaint form.

       " 'It’s Day 5 of cancellations and delays for the Atlanta-based carrier, which still struggles to recover from last week’s global IT outage. A Delta Air Lines jet sits at a gate at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. (Photo by Daniel SLIM) At\\n8:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday, Delta Air Lines had already canceled 416 flights and delayed another 323. Together, 20% of the airline’s daily scheduled departures were disrupted, according to FlightAware. By 3 p.m., the tally of disrupted flights had ticked up significantly to 467 cancellations and 998 delays, representing 41% of Delta’s scheduled flights for the day. Air travelers can expect this number to increase throughout the afternoon and evening. The Atlanta-based carrier lags behind competitors in returning to normal operations after the CrowdStrike software update grounded flights globally on Friday. More than half of Delta’s IT systems worldwide are Windows-based, the company said in a statement, noting that outage impacted the airline’s “deeply complex” staffing software system. “The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.” “We’ve got everyone around the company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a video message to employees on Monday. “Keep taking great care of our customers and each other in the coming days.” On Monday, three-quarters of Delta’s scheduled departures were either canceled (30%) or delayed (46%). Comparatively, rivals American Airlines and United Airlines saw 50% and 33%, respectively, of their flights delayed on Monday. Both airlines canceled only 2% of Monday’s flights, respectively. “The [Department of Transportation] has opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on Threads on Tuesday morning. “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly, and I will make sure that right is upheld.” The statement follows a similar thread yesterday in which the secretary promised to “hold [Delta] to all applicable passenger protections,” adding that “Delta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance.” Delta has extended its travel waiver for passengers whose flights were booked for July 19-23. The waiver lets customers make a one-time change to their itinerary. The fare difference for customers will be waived if flights are rebooked for travel on or before July 28. Customers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed flight may receive an eCredit for the unflown portion of the trip, or may instead request a cash refund for the unflown portion of the trip. Impacted passengers should save their receipts. The airline is covering eligible expenses resulting from a disruption, including providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation.',\n",
       " 'Delta Air Lines is canceling hundreds of flights four days on from a mass IT outage connected to a defective update issued by the Texas-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. As most airlines began to recover following the technology issues, Delta has struggled to restore operations to full capacity, now resorting to manually resetting each system affected by the meltdown. In a statement on Monday, Delta said over half of its IT systems globally are Windows-based. \"The CrowdStrike error required Delta\\'s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other,\" the statement said. It explained that the airline\\'s crew-tracking-related tool, which ensures flights are fully staffed, has needed manual support to repair. On Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the critical tool could not effectively process the number of changes prompted by the Microsoft Windows operating system\\'s shutdown. On Friday, air travel was hit particularly hard by the outage, with passengers facing chaos at airports as over 5,000 flights worldwide were canceled and over 40,000 were delayed, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking data platform. Delta grounded 1,207 flights on Friday, almost a third of its total scheduled departures. The airline with the next highest number of cancellations was United Airlines, with 694 cancellations. Since Friday, Delta has canceled over 5,000 flights, per FlightAware data. Delta canceled 394 flights on Tuesday as of 6.50 a.m. ET, representing 11% of its scheduled departures, and almost 40% of total flights canceled across airlines around the world, FlightAware data showed Cancellations for other airlines have reduced to the tens and single digits, including for United, which canceled about 1% of its flights. Passengers at Delta\\'s largest hub, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, have grappled with travel chaos, with cancellations and delays continuing into the week. Delta announced that it extended a travel waiver, offering customers with flights booked from July 19 to 23 the option to change their itinerary free of charge. Bastian also said on Sunday that passengers who experienced flight disruptions were being offered travel and meal vouchers, hotel accommodations, transportation where available, and Delta SkyMiles, the airline\\'s loyalty program that gives points to flyers for upgrades and flights. Pete Buttigieg, the Secretary for Transportation, said in a post on X Tuesday that the Department of Transportation has \"opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions.\"',\n",

       " 'Most of the world has slowly recovered from the devastating CrowdStrike and Microsoft outages that hamstrung countless businesses and industries last Friday. One airline, however, is still struggling early this week. Delta Airlines is still dealing with numerous cancelled flights and delays. It\\'s become clear the airline has had a much more difficult time getting back on its feet than other companies across nearly all sectors of the economy. Around midday Tuesday, more than 455 Delta flights had been cancelled, far outpacing any other airline, according to data from FlightAware. It also had more than 650 delays. Computer systems in airports, at airlines, and pretty much everywhere else went down Friday, but Delta has had unique struggles trying to recover. The issue with Delta largely stems from a crew-tracking tool that relies on Windows, leaving the airline in a difficult position as it tried to manage the overwhelming schedule changes caused by the outages. “The technology issue occurred on the busiest travel weekend of the summer, with our booked loads exceeding 90%, limiting our re-accommodation capabilities,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian wrote in a letter to customers. \"Specifically, the issue impacted the Microsoft Windows operating system. Delta has a significant number of applications that use that system, and in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown. Our teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.\" Delta has to manually reset a ton of computers. Half its IT systems are Windows-based, which meant they crashed and need to be manually fixed after the CrowdStrike issue. \"The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other,\" the company said in statement. So if you\\'re flying Delta on Tuesday or the upcoming days, just know there\\'s a good chance the airline is still reeling from the CrowdStrike outages.',\n",
       " 'Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian apologized and offered frequent flyer miles to travelers for thousands of flight cancellations as the carrier struggled to recover from Friday’s globe-spanning IT outage, disruptions that sparked criticism from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The Atlanta-based airline canceled more than 4,600 flights from Friday through Sunday, more than any other airline, according to aviation data firm OAG. On Monday morning, Delta had already canceled another 700 flights, or 18% of its mainline operation, making up the vast majority of cancellations in the U.S. The delays and cancellations have put Delta in a rare spotlight for the carrier whose leaders pride themselves on reliability and punctuality. “We continue to receive reports of unacceptable disruptions and customer service conditions at Delta Air Lines, including hundreds of complaints filed with our Department,” Buttigieg said in an emailed statement late Sunday. “I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds” to customers who chose to call off their trips because of the disruptions as well as “timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers.” The disruptions have persisted at Delta while most other carriers have recovered. American Airlines said it was almost back to normal by Saturday. United Airlines had elevated flight disruptions on Sunday with 9% of its schedule canceled, or 260 flights, according to FlightAware, but still below Delta’s. “I want to apologize to every one of you who have been impacted by these events,” Bastian said in a message to customers. “Delta is in the business of connecting the world, and we understand how difficult it can be when your travels are disrupted.” The airline was offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up shifts, a staff memo on Sunday said. The carrier called some of them on their personal phones to come in, according to a person familiar with the matter. High demand during some one of the busiest periods of summer challenged the airline to find alternative flights for affected travelers, Bastian said in his note. Delta Air Lines has a number of Microsoft tools that were impacted in the outage, “in particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in his note. That would make the event similar to an issue Southwest Airlines suffered, on a much greater scale, at the end of 2022 when it failed to recover from severe winter weather for days.',\n",
       " '‘Vacation from hell’: Delta passengers stranded for fourth straight day BOSTON — Thousands of Delta passengers were stranded for a fourth straight day as the airline still struggles to recover from the largest IT outage in history. Delta cancelled more than 20 percent of its trips in or out of Boston’s Logan Airport for much of the day on Monday. It followed the cancellation of about 1,300 Delta flights on Sunday, roughly the same number as each of the previous two days. Friday’s tech outage hit Delta especially hard. The airline’s CEO said it affected not only their rebooking system but also crew tracking tools, which ensures that flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time. “It has been a nightmare. This is the vacation from hell,” said Roberta Harris of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Roberta and Jim Harris departed Florida on Friday morning and then got stranded on what felt like a never-ending layover in Atlanta. “From there it just went to hell,” she said. “We would wait in line for hours, and they would cancel the flight at the last minute.” The couple was supposed to arrive in Boston Friday afternoon around 3p for a cruise to Iceland and Greenland. They finally arrived at Logan around 5 p.m. on Monday after five cancelled flights on Delta. “Now we have to try to catch up to that ship,” said Jim Harris. “By the time we get there, the cruise will be half over!”',\n",
       " 'Delta canceled another 400 flights Tuesday as its troubles in the wake of the global CrowdStrike-Microsoft IT outage dragged on for the fifth consecutive day. The Atlanta-based carrier also saw more than 300 flights delayed Tuesday. The ongoing issues have prompted the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection to open an inquiry into Delta, citing “the high volume of consumer complaints” it has received about issues at the carrier. “We have made clear to Delta that they must take care of their passengers and honor their customer service commitments,” DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “This is not just the right thing to do, it’s the law, and our department will leverage the full extent of our investigative and enforcement power to ensure the rights of Delta’s passengers are upheld.” Delta has been uniquely affected by the global IT outage compared with other major carriers, who have since largely resumed normal operations. In a statement on its website Monday afternoon, Delta estimated that more than half of its IT systems worldwide rely on Microsoft Windows. Friday\\'s CrowdStrike error, it said, \"required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.\" It continued: \"One of Delta’s most critical systems — which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time — is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize,\" it said. A Delta representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.    Social media has been filled with images of passengers stranded away from their destinations. An additional complicating factor has been coordinating flyers\\' luggage as they seek to rebook, reflected in a significant volume of Delta\\'s social media team responses on X related to baggage issues. Bastian said the company is working around the clock to get its operation back on track, but it will take another couple of days before the worst is over.',\n",

Delta and its Delta Connection partners canceled close to 500 flights on Tuesday by midday on the East Coast, accounting for about two-thirds of all cancellations in the United States, according to FlightAware. The outage began Thursday night into Friday morning, after a faulty software upgrade from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to more than 8 million Microsoft computers around the world. The Atlanta-based carrier has canceled more than 6,600 flights since the outage started, far more than any other airline, according to figures from FlightAware and travel-data provider Cirium. Delta said it was cooperating with the investigation. “We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation after cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike’s faulty Windows update rendered IT systems across the globe inoperable,” an airline spokesperson said in a statement. \"Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.” Delta has said upward of half its technology systems run on Microsoft Windows, including a tool the airline uses to schedule pilots and flight attendants. That system could not keep up with the high number of changes triggered by the outage. The Transportation Department said it launched the investigation after seeing Delta\\'s continued widespread flight disruptions “and reports of concerning customer service failures.” The department said the investigation will evolve as it “processes the high volume of consumer complaints we have already received against Delta.” Investigators are likely to focus on whether Delta is complying with federal rules and offering prompt refunds to passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed. In a text provided to The Associated Press, a Delta passenger whose flight was canceled Saturday was told, “If you prefer not to rebook your trip, your ticket value will automatically be available as an eCredit that can be used towards a future Delta ticket.” This Delta Airlines passenger said she\\'s been on hold for more than six hours while waiting in line at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on July 23, 2024, days after the CrowdStrike global outage.

       " 'Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, made the announcement after the airline suspended travel for unaccompanied minors. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday that his department had opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines after the tech outage last week disrupted flights worldwide, and the agency wanted to hear from travelers who said that the airline had not complied with passenger protection requirements. The aim of the investigation is to “ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,” Mr. Buttigieg said in a statement. “All airline passengers have the right to be treated fairly,” he added. The Transportation Department has consumer protection requirements that cover lost baggage, lengthy tarmac delays, compensation for being bumped from an overbooked flight and other protections. Passengers should try to resolve their travel issues directly with Delta, Mr. Buttigieg said, but the department wanted to hear from those who thought the airline “has not complied” with the protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. His announcement included a link to a form for passengers to provide information about their concerns. Mr. Buttigieg’s statement did not specifically mention the reports of unaccompanied minors being stranded at airports, but the department said in an email that it was “seeking answers” about the situation and that it was “extremely concerned.” We “have made clear that we expect Delta to prioritize getting kids safely and swiftly to their destinations,” the emailed statement said. Delta barred children under 18 from traveling without a guardian as it struggled to recover from the global technology outage on Friday, which crippled Microsoft systems, hobbling train networks, disrupting hospitals and forcing airlines around the world to ground flights. The airline initially suspended travel for unaccompanied minors until Sunday, but then it extended the suspension through Tuesday. “Those already booked will not be able to travel,” Delta’s website said. “Please do not book new travel for unaccompanied minors during this time.” Delta has been the slowest U.S. airline to restore its operations, canceling more than 1,000 flights each day from Friday to Monday. More than 450 had been canceled as of midday on Tuesday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Some families said they had not been notified of the change until their children were turned away at the airline counter at the airport. The airline said on Tuesday that it was cooperating with the Transportation Department’s investigation. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta,” the company said in a statement. Some Delta employees have also expressed frustration with the airline’s struggles to recover from the technology outage last week. Capt. Darren Hartmann, the chairman of the company’s pilots union, the Delta Master Executive Council, said in a message to his members that the pilots felt “that we have been abandoned in the system” after being stranded at airports and being unable to get in touch with anyone at the company.']"

      "\"In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\" said Delta CEO Ed Bastian. Delta Airlines canceled at least 700 flights on Monday and nearly 4,800 more over the weekend, according to an AP report. Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. As of 8:30 am ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 420 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 18 flights. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. “The [Department of Transportation] has opened an investigation into Delta Air Lines to ensure the airline is following the law and taking care of its passengers during continued widespread disruptions,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on Threads on Tuesday morning. “While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,” he tweeted. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.” A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday the remainder of the week are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In additional to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked.

This disruption led to significant customer frustration, with many passengers stranded at airports like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for days. Despite efforts to accommodate affected travelers, Delta has faced challenges in finding alternative flights, with mounting frustration at customer service lines. Delta crew members are also dealing with similar frustrations, feeling \"abandoned in the system\" due to the inability to get in touch with company officials. The airline has been working \"around the clock\" to restore normal operations, offering meal vouchers, hotel accommodations, and ground transportation to affected customers. However, the recovery has been slow, with Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologizing and offering frequent flyer miles to travelers as compensation. The prolonged disruptions have left thousands of people stuck, highlighting the severe impact on Delta's operations and customer satisfaction."
