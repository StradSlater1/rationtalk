Not only was it the team’s most points scored of the Dan Campbell era but it was the most points scored by the Lions since Thanksgiving 1997 when they defeated the Chicago Bears 55-20 (Barry Sanders touchdown game). It was also the second time in three weeks that the Lions won by 38 points after not having a margin of victory that high since a 48-3 Week 2, 2011 win over the Chiefs.', 'While initially, it was a closer game than anticipated, tied at 14-14 early in the second quarter, the Lions poured it on with 38 straight points over the course of a 27:43 span in the second and third quarters.', 'It was a total team effort that led to a number of worthy candidates for game ball and unsung hero.', 'Game Ball – Kalif Raymond', 'Kalif Raymond’s role and demeanor are more of the unsung hero type, but for his efforts against the Titans, he was more than deserving to be tossed my post-game game ball.', 'Raymond perfectly encapsulates the Lions under Dan Campbell and Brad Holmes. Heart. Effort. Toughness. Selflessness. He’s got a chip on his shoulder with an against all odds, never back down, mentality.', 'Funny to think, after two seasons with the Titans in 2019-20, they decided not to bring back Raymond in free agency which led him to the Lions. Raymond had been on four teams, including two separate stints with both the Titans and New York Giants, prior to signing with the Lions in the 2021 offseason. The Lions handed both Breshad Perriman and Tyrell Williams one-year and $3-million-dollar contracts that offseason, and yet, Raymond is the one still left standing. He has even received very deserving contract extensions in back-to-back offseasons (2022 and 2023) to show how much he means to this team.', 'Raymond went out against his former team and became the first Detroit Lions player ever to score a punt return and a receiving touchdown in the same game. He did both in the same quarter to boot! Take that turd quarter.', ""In total, Raymond had 204 all-purpose yards including 190 punt return yards and two catches for 14 receiving yards (he was the Lions' second-leading receiver). His 190-yard outing in the punt return game is the fifth most all-time in an individual game in NFL history."", 'Raymond had returns of 90, 64, 24, 10, and 2 yards. He was a major spark for the team. Raymond was a guest captain for the game and Ben Johnson even had a play designed to get him a touchdown in his revenge game. Not bad for an undersized 30-year-old former journeyman return player.', 'Unsung Hero: Dave Fipp', ""On Sunday, the Lions' average starting field position was their own 45.9-yard line, including five possessions that started inside the Titans 26-yard line. Dave Fipp’s units deserve a lot of credit for setting the Lions offense up with a stacked deck (in addition to the four turnovers forced by the defense)."", 'Fipp went from catching some somewhat overly-critical heat for the failed fake punt against the Vikings to being this week’s unsung hero.', 'During Dan Campbell’s pregame interview on 97.1 The Ticket, he spoke about how when you watch the Titans special teams, those units don’t play like a 1-5 team and how Dave Fipp was excited for the challenge. Gee whiz, did he deliver.', 'Raymond’s performance in the punt return game, with the Titans averaging only 17.7 net yards per punt, was a valuable part of the special team’s efforts on the day but they were providing big plays in every facet.', 'Lions special teams set the tone early, with Sione Vaki forcing a fumble, which was recovered by the Titans, on the very first punt. The Lions punt unit would be the most heralded of the special teams unit on any other day with their performance if it wasn’t for the prolific punt returns. Jack Fox punted five times for 305 yards, which is an astounding 61 yards per punt. Fox’s day included a long punt of 67 yards and three punts downed inside the 20-yard line. The Lions punt coverage unit averaged 56.2 net yards per punt. There was a difference of 39.1 net yards per punt between the Lions and Titans. Unbelievable advantage.', ""Fipp was very vocal about the NFL passing the new dynamic kickoff rule. Entering Sunday’s game the Lions were ninth in the NFL averaging 28.2 yards per kick return however they were one of only two teams in the top 10 without a 40+ yard return. That changed Sunday, when following the Titans’ second touchdown to make it 14-14, Khalil Dorsey returned the kickoff 72 yards to the Titans' 25-yard line. It was the exact spark the team needed as they never looked back after scoring a few plays later to take the lead for good."", 'Per NextGenStats, the unit’s +196 return yards over expected is the most in a game since at least 2018 (previous high, +160).', 'As the cherry on top for the specialists, Jake Bates drilled a career-long 51-yard field goal and went a perfect seven-for-seven on extra point attempts. Bates is now 11-of-11 on field goal attempts this season.', ""Fipp is arguably the Lions' most underrated coach on the staff and he and his players were very much deserving of some limelight after Sunday.

But, on the positive side is what we talked about. Well, yeah, but when your special teams unit plays that well and is that productive, and then you do those little things, the red zone offensively and the takeaways defensively, well, you didn’t need it. You didn’t need to play your best there. You want to and we should, but it’s just another reminder. When we play, because we play with three units here, and when a couple of them are cooking at the right time, it can bail out one of your units. And, when you get them all three playing at the right time, I think you’re very hard to beat. So, I like where we’re at, we’re in a good place. It’s win number six, it’s a perfect setup. We get to go to Lambeau this week, I’m already excited. I know the guys are, and so it was good. That’s a good win.”', 'Jared Goff', ""On David Montgomery's touchdown pass to Sam LaPorta."", '""That was an absolute dart, and his dance was good too, after. We\'ve been cooking that one for a couple years, too. Good moment for it, too. Sam wasn\'t that open, he was open, but that had to be a good throw and that was an absolutely well-thrown ball.""', 'Kalif Raymond', 'On recovering from the low moments early in his career.', '""I remember 2017, goodness, gracious, I was struggling. Had a lot of fear, a lot of doubt. I remember actually I walked off the field, I think I was playing for the Giants, I said, \'I just played my last NFL game.\' I actually told myself that in my head. I had a choice during that time. That offseason, I was like, \'I can either go in the tank and quit, or I can give everything I have.\' That summer, I trained so hard. Probably over-trained, you can say. I trained so hard, I had so much help and I had a lot of people that helped me keep going. I\'m just thankful, thank God for being here today and being able to keep doing what I\'m doing.""', 'Taylor Decker', 'On the early pass-protection struggles.', '""On the first play of the game, we had a play-action pass called. The D-end, he played pass all the way and went right up the field, so that\'s on me. I\'ve got to be better in that situation. I don\'t remember the other one specifically, but yeah, we have to be better in protecting him. We know he\'s a play-maker when he can have some time back there. Overall, I would say the pass-protection was not up to our standard today.""', 'Trevor Nowaske', ""On overcoming the Titans' hot start and creating takeaways."", '""I feel like we\'re just a \'bend, don\'t break,\' kind of mentality. Obviously, we\'ve got some things to work on. Some things to clean up, but we had a couple good red-zone stops, a lot of turnovers, a lot of takeaways, which kind of helped us in the end. But, yeah, I feel like at the end of the day, we\'re a \'bend, don\'t break\' mentality on defense.""', 'Jahmyr Gibbs', 'On his 70-yard touchdown run.', '""I\'m not really doing nothing too much. It\'s really the line. Both long touchdowns I\'ve had these past two weeks, I was untouched. Again, shoutout to them.

Us as a defense, we just try to match the energy, man. We try to go out there and give them a spark. They already give us a spark, so we just try to give them the same spark they give us.""', 'Khalil Dorsey', ""On the special teams performance in Sunday's game."", '""It makes me happy, because all the days we practiced, especially in training camp and until now. I\'m happy for (Kalif Raymond) \'Leaf,\' he almost broke that record. I\'m happy for everybody. I feel like we executed on all levels. Still need to do some work here and there, but I think we did a great job.""', 'On his 72-yard kickoff return.', '“The play before, when they had kicked it to me, I saw the kicker was mad that I didn’t take it out. It was borderline, right on the edge, I’m like, ‘You’re either gonna have to kick it a little shorter,’ or whatever, but hopefully he gives me the green light from here on out. But, once I caught it, we had a double team to the left. I wasn’t worried about anybody to the front side, I know they’re not gonna catch me. I was like, ‘Alright, let’s just get there right now.’ Isaiah (Williams) had a great one-on-one block, and I just took it up. The rest was kind of a blur, I was just trying to beat everybody. I saw the kicker right there, took it to the outside, and there was one more dude. Got a step on him, but he was able to push me out. I just know my dad’s gonna be torturing me as soon as I get upstairs.""', 'Amon-Ra St. Brown', 'On scoring in five straight games and the overall offensive effort.', '""It\'s awesome. It\'s a sport that, obviously every receiver wants to score every week and have 100 yards, but that\'s not the reality of it. The biggest thing is winning. As long as we\'re winning, I feel like the rest of it can take care of itself. That\'s what we\'ve been doing. Putting up points, executing. I will say, I do feel like today on offense, when we were on the field, we could\'ve done a lot better. But, it\'s the way the game kind of played out. We were in the red zone a lot, and we executed well in the red zone. I feel like we could\'ve done better. But, we came out with a big win against a team that wasn\'t a pushover, like most people thought, and had a good defense, and we put up some points.""', 'Brock Wright', 'On the offense scoring 52 points despite Jared Goff throwing for only 85 yards.', '""It was weird. And, Sam at one point said, \'It kinda feels like it\'s taking a while.\' And, that\'s because we\'d been sitting on the bench for a while. Special teams just playing their butts off, getting us in great field position. Defense with the turnovers, so kind of one of those funky games. But, it\'s great to put up points like that and getting the ball spread around a lot. It\'s fun to see.""', 'Kerby Joseph', 'On how the defense is able to be in position to create takeaways.', '""To be honest, it comes with watching film, of course, and reading your keys.

He bounced around on multiple teams during his first five seasons in the league (the Broncos, the N.Y. Jets and Giants and the Titans). Plus, he spent the majority of those years on teams’ practice squads. And, when he did play during that time, it was almost exclusively as a kick and punt returner.', 'Raymond has earned every single opportunity he’s had in the league up to this point. And, he didn’t truly catch his big break until latching on with the Lions as a free agent in 2021, Campbell’s first season as Lions head man.', 'Raymond, who was a member of the Titans’ and Giants’ practice squads in 2018, didn’t play a single game during the aforementioned campaign. And then he proceeded to spend the next two seasons in Tennessee, but once again almost exclusively as a member of the team’s special teams unit. In fact, he logged a total of just 18 receptions for 357 yards and a lone touchdown in those two seasons combined.', 'Yet, Campbell was convinced that the undersized Raymond belonged in Detroit, and could play the receiver position for his then-rebuilding team.', '“I watched 10 plays, and I was like, ‘Holy sh*t. Whatever it takes, (Detroit general manager) Brad (Holmes), let’s get this guy in here,’” Campbell said in the locker room postgame, before handing Raymond a game ball.', 'Raymond, who inked just a one-year, $1.2 million deal to originally join the Lions, has rewarded Campbell & Co. – and then some – for taking a chance on him.', 'He finished among the Lions’ top three pass-catchers in receiving yards in each of his first two seasons in the Motor City (No. 3 in 2021 and No. 2 in 2022). Plus, he earned second-team All-Pro honors as a punt returner in 2022. Then, a season ago, he finished as the team’s No. 4-leading receiver.', 'All the while, Raymond has continued to play with the same underdog mentality that has made him easy to root on for Campbell and Lions fans.', 'And, it made it all the more rewarding to watch his standout performance on Sunday against one of his former teams in Tennessee. In the Week 8 affair, Raymond recorded 190 return yards on five punts, including a 90-yard return for touchdown in the third quarter.', 'Raymond, who prior to Sunday had last scored on a return in 2022, was more than ready for his return to the end zone.', '“I’ve been ready for that feeling too many times. It’s kind of surreal, it’s kind of like, ‘Oh, oh, it’s happening, it’s happening,’ saying, ‘Don’t mess up, don’t mess up,’” Raymond told reporters in the postgame. “But, no when you got guys like that – I’ve been saying it the past 30-45 minutes – when you got defensive guys who will go play three snaps, force a punt and then go block on the punt, it’s incredible. I think (against) Arizona, we almost had one, too, and (Lions CB) Carlton (Davis III) and ‘T.A.’ (Lions CB Terrion Arnold) are just like – they’re blocking and they’re like, ‘Let’s go.’ It’s just so cool when you have a team with that kind of character, those kind of guys, that kind of grit. It’s really cool.”', 'And then midway through the third quarter, Raymond caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Detroit signal-caller Jared Goff. In doing so, he became the first ever Lions player to amass a punt return touchdown and a receiving touchdown in the same game.', 'Goff felt like Raymond had been on the verge, for a while, of breaking a return for a touchdown.', '“I mean, he’s just been so close to breaking them through the whole year, it seems like, and today, those guys were blocking well for him, and he’s making those returns,” Goff said. “He’s as electric as it gets back there, and they kept kicking it to him, so he kept making them.”', 'Raymond’s 38.0-yard punt-return average against Tennessee is the highest by any player since the AFL/NFL merger in 1970 (on a minimum of five punt returns).', 'Campbell – to no surprise – heaped a ton of praise upon the ninth-year pro for his impressive effort.', '“Man, you talk about reliable and he’s consistent, and the way he prepares, the way he works, and he does everything for us, man,” Campbell said of Raymond. “He can play all the positions on offense, he’s a dynamic returner. That was good to see. It’s been a while since we got some big ones. He’s just, man, he’s the best. So, that was great, the team’s fired up for him, and I thought those guys blocked their rears off. And, the rest was up to him, you know. He just, he turned it on and found it.”', 'Raymond has found a home in Detroit, and Lions fans have found a soft spot in their hearts for the hard-working, never-say-never receiver.', 'The city of Detroit knows far too well what it’s like to be overlooked and counted out, and so does Raymond.

The NFC North-leading Lions have the conference’s best record at 6-1. They have won five straight, averaging 40-plus points over the last four. Detroit had its highest-scoring game since a 55-point performance against Chicago in 1997, and scored at least 50 for the fourth time in franchise history. The Titans were routed for a second straight week to fall to 1-6.  The Lions were efficient on offense, converting on all five chances in the red zone, and the other two phases were dominant. Detroit’s defense forced four turnovers, and its special teams produced Kalif Raymond’s 90-yard punt return for a TD, he finished with 190 yards on five punt returns, and Khalil Dorsey’s 72-yard kickoff return set up another score.

Daniels scrambled for several seconds before heaving the ball from the Commanders 35-yard line. It was deflected about 3 yards short of the goal line and fell into the arms of Brown, who was standing alone in the end zone. Chicago had taken its first lead with 23 seconds left in the game, going ahead 15-12 on a 1-yard TD run by Roschon Johnson after a pass-interference penalty on the Commanders.', 'Texans 23, Colts 20 – Stroud throws TD pass, Mixon adds score as Texans outlast Colts 23-20\nC.J.

That’s what first-year Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan had to do after his team repeatedly gave up long returns to the Detroit Lions in Sunday’s 52-14 embarrassment. The Titans allowed 262 yards and a touchdown on returns, sinking any hope Tennessee had of keeping the game close. Earlier this season, Tennessee had punts blocked in consecutive weeks. It’s a terrible look for first-year special teams coordinator Colt Anderson. After the game, Callahan said, “I think Colt’s a good football coach.”', 'NFL – Tyrique Stevenson taunts Washington fans seconds before Bears lose on Hail Mary\nChicago Bears cornerback Tyrique Stevenson could be seen taunting fans seconds before he and his teammates gave up a Hail Mary touchdown with time expired to lose to the Washington Commanders 18-15. Video posted on social media showed Stevenson pointing toward the stands and raising his arms in the air with his back to the play when the ball was snapped. He was late to get to the play and missed the chance to prevent Zach Ertz from tipping the ball up for Noah Brown to catch in the end zone.

Mitch Albom: Kalif Raymond shows even the smallest Lion has a mighty roar,https://www.freep.com/story/sports/columnists/mitch-albom/2024/10/28/mitch-albom-kalif-raymond-shows-even-smallest-lion-has-mighty-roar/75879899007/,"['Kalif Raymond waited for the ball to come out of the lights, then caught it on the 10-yard line and took off running. He passed the first Tennessee defender as if he’d been blown over backwards, cut past the second like a waterbug cuts past a lily, then left the rest of the defense behind like a cannonball leaves behind the cannon. He reached the end zone so fast, even the cheerleaders felt a crick in their necks.', 'Whiplash. With over 200 yards worth of punt returns and receiving — and two touchdowns — Raymond had the day of his dreams. And he’s been dreaming for a long time. This is a guy who went undrafted eight years ago, and played for four different NFL teams before he caught his first touchdown pass. He’s had more short-term contracts than a Motel 6. He’s been cut more times than sushi.', 'Yet at age 30, he did something Sunday that no Detroit Lion ever had — returned a punt for a touchdown and caught a TD pass in the same game — and was the most unlikely star of a most likeable afternoon.', 'LIONS GRADES:Special teams exemplary in 52-14 decimation of Titans', '“It was,” Kalif would say after the 52-14 blowout, “a really cool game.”', 'Everybody loves Raymond.', 'You see, every four years or so, like an election, the Lions face the Titans. And the last six times, Detroit has lost. Then came Sunday. And if this game were a presidential race, CNN would have called it at the coin flip.', '“That team (Tennessee) came out and played hard …” Dan Campbell said. “I know it doesn’t look that way.”', 'No, it doesn’t. But the Lions were responsible for that. They didn’t just beat the Titans for the first time since the franchise moved out of Houston, they ran through them, ran over them, then pushed them down an elevator shaft. Their defense kept stealing the ball away. And the sideline became a Detroit superhighway, where play after play, various Lions would outrace a gaggle of Titans defenders for big gains or touchdowns.', 'The Lions hung 52 points on the board. And I think they slept through the fourth quarter.', '“We did not play our cleanest ball,” Campbell said. “However, when you have four takeaways on defense, five-for-five in the red zone, and you have the returns our special teams units had … then you can get a lot of production. …', '“Once again, this team knows how to complement itself.”', 'Yes. As in, “Nice play, Kalif. Nice play, David. Nice play, Sam. …”', 'Remember, this was supposed to be a week where the Lions bemoaned who they didn’t have: no Aiden Hutchinson, no Jamison Williams, no Josh Pashcal. Instead they looked like a movie cast that barely had enough costumes for its stars.', 'Raymond returned that punt 90 yards to the promised land. Jahmyr Gibbs ran 70 yards for a touchdown. David Montgomery ran for one and THREW for another. Both tight ends had TD catches. If the game went any longer, the equipment manager was gonna score.', ""Weird as it sounds, the LEAST impressive player was the Lions' biggest offensive star, their quarterback, Jared Goff. And all he did was go 12-for-15 with three touchdowns. On 85 yards."", '“I’ll take it,” Goff said. “I’ve had a lot of games where I’ve had a whole lot of yards and not a lot of touchdowns.”', 'But that’s what you get when your offense is humming, your defense is humming, your special teams are humming and your opposition sings like Tiny Tim.', ""Tennessee (1-6) is a bad team that, we must admit, is also badly coached. The Titans on Sunday not only threw two interceptions, lost two fumbles, drew eight penalties and gave up over 260 yards on special teams, but they had the ball with first-and-goal from the Lions' 1-yard line and called FOUR STRAIGHT PASSES, all of them unsuccessful."", 'It takes skill to be that pigheaded. I don’t want to say Tennessee made mistakes, but if their foot were a gun, it would shoot itself.', '“This,” their coach, Brian Callahan, said after the game, “is how you get beat by a really good football team.”', 'Well. Who can argue with that?', 'But let’s leave further critique of the Titans to the fine folks in Tennessee, and instead get back to Raymond, who, at 5 feet 8, may be the smallest Lion, but is likely the most beloved.', 'Goff admires him. His teammates embrace him. And if you want to make the tough-as-leather Campbell choke up, just ask him to tell you Raymond’s arrival story from 2021.', '“We were fresh on the job, and (Brad Holmes, the Lions GM) said, ‘Hey, take a peek at this guy from Tennessee. He’s really a returner. … You think there’s a place for him on offense?’', '“And I watched about 10 plays, and I was like, ‘Yeah. Absolutely there is. Take this guy in a heartbeat.’ And it’s been a blessing ever since to get Leaf here.”', 'Remember, this is a man who played for Denver, the N.Y. Jets, the N.Y. Giants twice and the Titans twice before signing with Detroit. He admitted Sunday there was a moment in 2018 when he came off the field with the Giants and told himself, “I just played my last NFL game.”', '“I was struggling,” he admitted Sunday. “ I had a lot of fear. A lot of doubt. …', '“I had a choice during that offseason. I was like, I can either go in the tank, just kind of quit, or I can give it everything I have.”', 'He chose the latter. Redoubled his efforts. Dedicated every minute to getting better. Which, when you think about it, kind of parallels the Lions since they started 1-6 just two years ago.', 'Look at them now. They’ve flipped that record — they are 6-1 — and currently hold the top seed in the NFC. More importantly, they showed last week they can beat the hottest team (Minnesota) and this week, the coldest.', 'That’s more impressive than it sounds. The NFL is not college, where expected blowouts usually happen. Pro teams are relatively close. And this may be hard for you crazy kids to believe, but there was a time when Detroit regularly lost games like these. Bad teams came to town, and Detroit stumbled and bumbled and handed them victories.', 'It’s hard to imagine the 2024 Lions doing that. They are too inspired. They take things too seriously. They are also just too damn good. They keep stepping up whenever there is a hole. Or filling those holes with new heroes.', 'They did it again on Sunday. You didn’t hear anyone saying “Where’s Jamo?” in Ford Field. But you might have heard a few Titans screaming, “Where’s Kalif?”', 'Uh. He’s behind you.', 'Everybody loves Raymond.', 'Contact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com. Check out the latest updates with his charities, books and events at MitchAlbom.com.

Detroit Lions vs. Titans score today: Recap from Lions' blowout 52-14 win,https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2024/10/27/lions-titans-game-score-updates-highlights-tv-channel/75843400007/,"['The Detroit Lions returned to Ford Field for the lone home game in a stretch of four road games in five weeks and decimated the Tennessee Titans.', ""The Lions scored the final 38 points on Sunday to blow out the Titans 52-14 in the first AFC matchup of Detroit's season. The Lions (6-1) have now won five straight to remain as the last one-loss team in the NFC. The Titans's struggles continued as they dropped to 1-6."", ""The Lions are leading the Titans 52-14 in the fourth quarter. It was a very high-scoring first half powered by Detroit's explosive plays in all three phases. The Lions and Titans traded punches early in a 14-14 start that included a 70-yard touchdown run from Jahmyr Gibbs, Then, a long Khalil Dorsey kickoff return set up a quick Brock Wright touchdown, a Kerby Joseph interception set up an Amon-Ra St. Brown touchdown, and a Kalif Raymond long punt return led to a David Montgomery touchdown pass to Sam LaPorta."", 'The Lions forced a quick three-and-out to start the second half and Raymond returned the punt 90 yards for a touchdown. Amik Robertson forced a Calvin Ridley fumble and Raymond scored a second touchdown three plays later. Jake Bates hit a field goal at the end of the third quarter to push the lead to 38. Linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez was ruled out in the first quarter with an ankle injury.', ""The Lions showed they have what it takes to be a contender again without star pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson through another outing scoring over 30 points (fourth straight game with more than 30 points) while getting big returns in special teams and three turnovers from the defense. This was the Lions' second-to-last game before the Nov. 5 trade deadline as the front office looks to bolster the edge of the defensive line."", ""The offense was without one of its top weapons, Jameson Williams, as he sits out for the first game of a two-game suspension for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy, but the Lions still managed to score seven touchdowns thanks to short field all afternoon. The Lions are on the road for the next two games against fellow contenders in the Green Bay Packers and Houston Texans."", 'Check out the game recap from Ford Field below.', ""Amik Robertson just forced his second fumble of the second half with another forceful punch out on Chig Okonkwo on a short completion behind the line of scrimmage and defensive end Isaiah Thomas scooped up the loose ball at Detroit's 22-yard line. The Lions have forced three turnovers, two from Robertson and one from Kerby Joseph. Hendon Hooker and the Lions' backup offense is taking the field to finish out the fourth quarter."", ""The first non-touchdown points came for Detroit after running the ball into Titans' territory before being stopped at the Tennessee 33-yard line on a deep shot to Tim Patrick. Jake Bates nailed the 51-yard field goal to push the Lions past 50 points and give them the most points scored by an NFL team this season with over a full quarter still remaining."", ""The Lions keep on coming up with big plays in each phase. Detroit had to punt on its first possession of the second half, but got the ball back after the Titans' first play. They ran a reverse to the right with Calvin Ridley and Amik Robertson peanut-punched the ball loose and Carlton Davis jumped on it at Tennessee's 26-yard line."", 'The Lions only needed three plays to find the end zone. Jahmyr Gibbs ran for seven yards and then Sam LaPorta picked up a first down with a 10-yard gain before Jared Goff hit Kalif Raymond uncovered on a swing route for his second touchdown.', ""Kalif Raymond is trying to follow in Jake Bates' footsteps and earn NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. He became the sixth different Lions player to score a touchdown Sunday after he received a Ryan Stonehouse punt at the Lions' 10-yard line, made both of Tennessee's gunners miss with a pair of crisp jukes and took off down the right sideline for a 90-yard touchdown. It is the second-longest punt return touchdown in Lions' history and the longest at a home game since 1963."", ""The Titans seemed prime to cut into Detroit's big lead just before the half, but could not pick up one yard on four attempts from Detroit's 1-yard line. A pass interference penalty and 34-yard completion against Nick Westbrook-Ikhine put the Titans deep in Lions' territory, and then another pass interference against Brian Branch put the Titans on the 1. Tennessee attempted four straight passes to the short left, but Mason Rudolph missed on each of them to keep the Titans out of the end zone."", ""The Lions defense forced another Titans' punt, and Kalif Raymond returned the punt 64 yards to the Tennessee 25-yard line. Jahmyr Gibbs picked up a first down with a pair of runs, then Ben Johnson dialed up some more trickery on second-and-goal. Jared Goff pitched it to Montgomery, who fired a missile to Sam LaPorta in the corner of the end zone on a pitch pass to put the Lions ahead three touchdowns."", ""The Lions' defense came up with their first big play, courtesy of ballhawk Kerby Joseph. On the first play of the Titans' drive, Joseph jumped in front of a crossing route to intercept Mason Rudolph and returned it to Tennessee's 12-yard line. Jared Goff hit Sam LaPorta on an out route at the goal line that was originally ruled a touchdown, but was called down at the 1 after review. The Lions ran a hard run-fake right and leaked St. Brown out of the formation left for a wide-open touchdown. Joseph now has five interceptions through seven games, second-most in the NFL."", ""It didn't take long for the Lions to jump ahead again. Khalil Dorsey returned the kickoff 72 yards to the Titans' 25-yard line for prime field position and then a double penalty against defensive back Jarvis Brownlee put Detroit inside the 10-yard line. The Lions dialed up a run-fake and Jared Goff hit a wide-open Brock Wright in the flat after he came across the formation for the touchdown."", ""The Titans' offense is rolling with Rudolph. Tennessee put together a seven-play, 70-yard touchdown, starting with a 47-yard deep shot to Calvin Ridley at the end of the first quarter. He caught two more passes for 29 yards to reach the Lions' 15-yard line and then Tony Pollard put them inside the 5. Rudolph hit Westbook-Ikhine in the back of the end zone to tie the game."", ""Jahmyr Gibbs' speed is lethal."", 'On the first play following the touchdown, Gibbs got to the left side of the field and took off down the sideline for an untouched 70-yard touchdown to put Detroit back in front immediately. The Lions have 97 rushing yards on four carries between Gibbs and David Montgomery. Frank Ragnow and Graham Glasgow sealed out the inside defender while Taylor Decker carved out a big hole by deflecting the defensive end to the sideline.', 'The Titans were the ones able to turn defense into quick offense this time.', ""The Titans forced another Lions punt with consecutive sacks on Jared Goff on the left side from Roger McCreary and Arden Key. On the first play of Tennessee's drive, Rudolph hit Josh Whyle for a 35-yard gain to reach Detroit's territory, then he found Calvin Ridley on a slot fade for a 26-yard gain to Detroit's 11-yard line. A play later, Rudolph kept it on a play-fake, juked Trevor Nowaske than ran in for an 11-yard touchdown."", 'The turnover turned into points in just two plays. David Montgomery picked up 10 yards on a first-down run and a facemask penalty against Tennessee put the Lions at the 7-yard line. On the next play, Montgomery got the ball again off the right side of the line and pinballed off a defender past the goal line to give Detroit an early lead.', ""The Lions received the opening kick but quickly went three-and-out. The Titans picked up the first first down of the game on a curl to Calvin Ridley, but Mason Rudolph gave it to Detroit on the next set of downs. Rudolph held onto the ball for too long and didn't realize he was getting pressured by Levi Onwuzurike before too late, and tried to dump it off late to the flat, but Nowaske was right there for the interception."", ""Defensive end Josh Paschal, who is now starting due to injuries up front, is out with an illness, The Lions' other inactive are safety Loren Strickland, tight end Parker Hesse and tackles Giovanni Manu and Colby Sorsdal."", ""The Titans are really beat up and without quarterback Will Levis, running back Tyjae Spears, linebacker Jerome Baker and cornerback L'Jarius Sneed."", ""The Lions are confident in their offense even without Williams, who was in the midst of a breakout start as the team's second-leading receiver. The offensive line will be at full strength with right guard Kevin Zeitler in the lineup with the running back duo of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs healthy and ready to go against Tennessee's stout front."", 'Jared Goff will look to continue his MVP-level start to the season with Amon-Ra St. Brown, Sam LaPorta, Gibbs, Kalif Raymond and Tim Patrick as the primary receiving options this week. Goff has been historically efficient over the last month and found the right buttons to push with offensive coordinator Ben Johnson to average 30.3 points per game.', 'The Titans will be starting backup quarterback Mason Rudolph for the second straight game as Will Levis sits out with a shoulder injury. The Titans have been the worst passing offense in the NFL and second-worst in giveaways but have found some success on the ground with Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears. The defense has been by far the better unit as the best in the NFL at limiting yards with an approach of keeping everything in front of them.', 'Date: Sunday, Oct. 27.', 'Time: 1 p.m. ET.', 'Where: Ford Field in Detroit.', 'TV channel: Fox.', 'Streaming: Fubo (free trial).', 'Radio: WXYT-FM (97.1) in Detroit (find all Lions radio affiliates).', 'Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press: The Titans have a good defensive nucleus, but they haven’t made enough game-altering plays this season to be considered one of the NFL’s best on that side of the ball.

""You give up a punt return for a touchdown, you give up a long kickoff to give the defense another short field, and ultimately you turn the ball over four times. At some point we\'re going to stop doing that and we\'ll be able to play a competitive football game, but until then that\'s what they look like.""', 'Mason Rudolph made his second straight start in place of the injured Will Levis. He threw for 266 yards and had both a touchdown rushing and passing as the Titans matched the Lions early in a 14-14 game.', 'But Detroit matched each Tennessee score immediately. First, with a Jahmyr Gibbs 70-yard touchdown run off the left side of the Lions offensive line on the first play of a drive, then with a three-play, 25-yard touchdown drive that was set up by a 72-yard Khalil Dorsey kickoff return.', 'Jared Goff, who had just 85 yards passing, hit Brock Wright for an eight-yard touchdown and a 21-14 lead. The Lions never looked back.', ""Kerby Joseph jumped an over route on the very next play from scrimmage, intercepting Rudolph's pass intended for Chig Okonkwo and returning it to the Tennessee 12. Three plays later Goff hit a wide-open Amon-Ra St. Brown for a one-yard TD and the route was on."", '""Unfortunately it\'s the same story of giving them some easy ones,"" Rudolph said. ""Once again putting our defense on a short field. I\'ve got to protect the ball better.""', 'The Titans turned it over four times in all, including fumbles by Calvin Ridley and Okonkwo, leading directly to 21 Detroit points.', 'The Lions took advantage of an extremely short field, posting five touchdown drives of 26 yards or fewer to pour it on despite being outgained 416-225 on the afternoon.', '""It\'s tough,"" outside linebacker Arden Key said. ""Detroit\'s offense only had 130-something yards in the first half. It\'s just frustrating because every week it\'s something different. We\'ve got to figure it out and get it fixed.""', ""Tennessee's season long special teams' woes continued. Detroit posted an almost inconceivable 262 return yards against Colt Anderson's beleaguered unit, raising questions about whether the first-year special teams coordinator will hold that position much longer."", ""In addition to Dorsey's kickoff return, former Titan Kalif Raymond shredded Tennessee's coverage on two different punt returns. His 64-yard return late in the first half set up a 22-yard drive that was capped by a David Montgomery halfback pass to Sam LaPorta. He then had a 90-yard punt return for a touchdown in the third quarter."", '""We don\'t get down and cover,"" Callahan said. ""We missed tackles today.

Check out our Week 8 stock report.', 'The Detroit Lions manhandled the Tennessee Titans by a score of 52-14 to move to 6-1 on the season. The final score tells a story of a beatdown, but the first quarter and a half didn’t look like that would be the case. There’s still a lot to work on for Detroit entering a tougher stretch of their season. Here are your movers for the week:', 'Taylor Decker’s rough season continues. After what was arguably his worst game of the year last week against the Vikings, Decker picked up right where he left off with a rough start to Sunday. He gave up two sacks in the first quarter alone to Titans EDGE Arden Key, who has just one sack in six previous games this season. Then, he gave up a third in the third quarter to Justin Simmons. To make matters worse, two of those three sacks caused fumbles from Jared Goff, and the Lions were lucky that the offense was able to recover them.', 'Stats: 2 rec, 14 yards, 1 TD; 5 punt returns, 180 yards, 1 TD', 'You couldn’t write a better revenge game for Kalif Raymond. He didn’t see much action on offense, but did catch both of his targets for 14 yards and a touchdown. His real magic came on punt returns, averaging 38 yards on five returns, including a 90-yard return for a touchdown. Those numbers would’ve been even higher had it not been for a penalty that took 20 yards off his last punt return. Oh, and he also made history:', 'It was a nice rebound game for Glasgow after a tough outing last week against Minnesota. Glasgow sharpened up against a stout Titans defensive line, paving the way in the run game for the Lions to average 6.8 yards per carry. He climbed to the second level for a pivotal block on Jahmyr Gibbs’ 70-yard rushing touchdown. Glasgow wasn’t perfect in pass protection, but Sunday was an improvement over last week to trend in the right direction again.', 'Stats: 6 tackles, 2 passes defended, 1 INT', 'Kerby giveth, and Kerby taketh. Sunday was no different. It was a brutal start to the game for Joseph, confusing his assignments and playing out of position when deep in coverage. At one point, defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn chewed out Joseph after he left a man wide open in the end zone on Mason Rudolph’s rushing touchdown.', 'However, Joseph redeemed himself in classic Joseph fashion, with a timely interception that he returned deep into Titans territory to pull the Lions out of reach of the Titans. Had it not been for that pick, Joseph would be firmly in stock down territory. But turnovers are the name of the game, and he showed up to play on Sunday.', 'Stats: 2 tackles, 1 TFL, 2 forced fumbles', 'It was almost the same narrative as Joseph for Amik Robertson Sunday. He looked brutal in coverage and constantly found himself a step behind. Mason Rudolph picked on Robertson for the entire time in which the Titans offense looked decent.', 'However, like with Joseph, Robertson came up huge with two forced fumbles. They did come in the third and fourth quarter, respectively, when the game was pretty much over, but turnovers are turnovers. Had we just been looking at Robertson’s coverage today, it would have been a stock down. A forced fumble put him at neutral on the day. Two forced fumbles? That’s an honest day’s work by Amik.', 'Stats: 6 tackles, 1 QB hit', 'Are you seeing a trend yet? Similar to Kerby and Amik, Brian Branch had a rough day on the back end. It was only a matter of time for Branch to come down to earth after playing like one of the best defenders in the entire NFL this past month. Lucky for the Lions, Branch hit his rough patch in a game where they didn’t need him to come up big.', 'It was a tough day in run and in pass for Branch. He, like almost every other Lions defender, struggled to bring down Tony Pollard in run defense. Then Branch got tagged with two defensive pass interference penalties on the same drive from the Titans’ last possession of the half. It was uncharacteristically poor performance from Branch, and without the turnovers to annul that bad performance like his peers in the secondary, he gets a stock down.', 'Dave Fipp, Special teams coordinator: I gave Fipp a stock down two weeks ago for the special team unit’s poor performances in coverage and returns. Boy, did the Lions turn that around. It was against one of the worst special teams units in the league, so I’m not sure this level of play will be sustained, but it was a very impressive day from top to bottom by Fipp’s units.', 'Jack Fox, P: Speaking of special teams units, Fox had an unreal day with an average of 61 yards on five punts, including three inside the 20-yard line.', 'Alex Anzalone, LB: Anzalone had an uncharacteristically slow day, looking lost in coverage early and whiffing on several tackles. He did come up with a sack in the second half and sharpened up as the game went on, but not his finest performance.', 'Carlton Davis III, CB: Davis got abused early and often by Calvin Ridley, as did many Lions secondary players. Davis also struggled in run defense in the first half, including one play where a bad pursuit angle gave up the edge and an additional 10+ yards to the Titans offense.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

It was a good play.', '“Maybe [I was a hair late], but if anything, I’m waiting a second longer and launching it up to Nick Westbrook, who got behind the safety as he was driving.”', 'Rotten Ratio: The Titans began the afternoon with a minus-nine turnover ratio, second worst in the NFL behind the Las Vegas Raiders’ minus-13 figure.', 'Tennessee’s turnover numbers took another tumble in the loss to the Lions.', 'In addition to the two interceptions, the Titans suffered two lost fumbles, one each by wide receiver Calvin Ridley and tight end Chig Okonkwo.', 'Defensively, the Titans failed to produce a single takeaway. The Titans have intercepted just one pass in seven games this season, and they’ve recovered two fumbles.', 'Tennessee is 0-5 when losing the turnover battle this season.', '“At some point, we’re going to stop doing that and we’ll be able to play a competitive football game,” Callahan said. “But until then, that’s what [games] look like when you turn it over like that and don’t get any turnovers in return. It’s just not good enough anywhere.', '“Again, you play a good team on the road that’s built to capitalize on mistakes and make you pay for them … that’s what they did. That’s where we’re at.”', 'Passing Production: Though Rudolph’s two interceptions were the biggest part of his afternoon, he did put together some decent throwing numbers otherwise.', 'Rudolph completed 22-of-38 passes for 266 yards, throwing one touchdown pass and recording his first career touchdown run. The 266 yards were the most the Titans have thrown for this season, and Rudolph has now recorded two of the team’s three most productive passing days this season. He threw for 215 yards in last week’s loss to Buffalo.', 'Levis, who could return as early as next week, has thrown for more than 200 yards only once in four complete-game starts this season — 204 yards against Green Bay.', 'Rudolph produced a 47-yard completion to Ridley, a 34-yard throw to Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, a 33-yard throw to Josh Whyle and a 26-yard toss to Ridley. The Titans had only two plays of 30-plus yards going into Sunday’s contest.', '“There were some good things in the first half that we did,” Rudolph said. “We moved the ball, possessed the ball. But none of it matters when you get your butt kicked.”', 'Firing Blanks: The Titans had a chance to at least make things mildly interesting late in the first half.', 'Trailing 35-14, Tennessee put together a nine-play, 69-yard drive to the Lions’ 1-yard line with just over half a minute remaining in the second quarter.', 'At that point in the game, the Titans had run 13 times for 73 yards, averaging 5.6 yards per attempt. Tony Pollard had carried 10 times for 46 yards, averaging 4.6 yards per attempt.', 'But the Titans chose not to try to gain 36 inches via the run on four successive plays, instead throwing four straight incompletions.', '“[It was] their base defense against our sub [offense],” Callahan said. “I thought our advantage was the one-on-ones and we had opportunities. You can look back at it and second guess it all you want, but at the end of the day, I thought our best chance to get the ball in the end zone was to play a one-on-one game outside with those guys.”', 'Rudolph missed Westbrook-Ikhine on a fade on first down, threw two incompletions to Tyler Boyd (both short of the goal line, the second one dropped by Boyd) and missed Ridley in the back of the end zone on fourth down. Even if Ridley had managed to make the catch, the touchdown would have been overturned, as the Titans were flagged for two penalties. John Ojukwu was called for holding and Ridley called for illegally touching a pass after he’d stepped out of bounds.', '“To have moved the ball so well down the field and not get the [touchdown], yeah, it’s deflating,” Rudolph said. “But you still have a half to play. Got to put it behind you.”', 'Second-half Slumber Continues: The Titans entered Sunday’s game having been outscored 94-43 in second halves this season, and things only got worse against the Lions.', 'Despite already holding a 35-14 halftime lead, Detroit still outscored Tennessee 17-0 in the second half, meaning the Titans have now been outscored by a combined 111-43 total in second halves.', 'The Titans have scored only 12 points in the fourth quarter in seven games this season, and all 12 came in one contest — the lone victory against Miami.', 'Ridley Rolls: One of the very few bright spots for the Titans was Ridley’s stunning emergence after six frustrating weeks of subpar production.', 'Ridley, who signed a four-year, $92 million contract during the offseason, came into the contest with just 12 catches — tied for fifth on the team — for 183 yards and one receiving touchdown.', 'But in the first game following the Titans’ trade of five-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, Ridley was a terror from the start.', 'In the first half alone, Ridley posted seven catches for 126 yards, both numbers season highs. His 26-yard reception set up the Titans’ first touchdown and his 47-yard catch set up Tennessee’s second — and final — score.', 'Ridley piled up 10 catches on 15 targets for 143 yards before leaving the game early in the fourth quarter with a possible injury. The only blemish on Ridley’s day was a lost fumble, one that set up a 26-yard touchdown drive by the Lions.', '“I noticed he came to work every day with a great attitude and [was] catching as many balls as he could,” Rudolph said of Ridley. “He was hungry. You could tell that. He wanted to bounce back. We all did. We were clicking. He can take the top off a defense, and then they start to adjust and play zone when they’re up a couple scores. … But was happy to see him move some chains for us.”', 'Ridley’s 143 receiving yards were his most in a game since 2020, when he totaled 163 for Atlanta against Tampa Bay.', 'All he Does is Score: Westbrook-Ikhine posted his third straight game with a receiving touchdown, catching a five-yard scoring pass from Rudolph.', 'Westbrook-Ikhine has been targeted only 10 times in seven games this season, but three of his five catches have resulted in touchddowns.', 'A five-year veteran, Westbrook-Ikhine is the only Titans receiver with more than one touchdown catch this season.', 'Strange-Looking Stats: The Lions were so good in the return game and in the takeaway department that five of Detroit’s seven touchdowns came on drives of 26 yards or fewer.', 'As a result, the final stats looked really odd.', 'The Titans, for instance, outgained the Lions 416-225, ran 71 plays to Detroit’s 47 and held a time of possession edge of 35:37 to 24:23.', 'Maybe the weirdest stat of all: On a day the Lions rolled up 52 points, Detroit quarterback Jared Goff totaled just 85 passing yards. The Lions became just the third team since 1950 to score 50-plus points with fewer than 100 passing yards, joining the 1950 Giants (55 points vs Colts) and 1955 Bears (52 points vs Packers).', 'Nevertheless, Goff still completed 12-of-15 passes and connected for three TDs. His 129.9 quarterback rating meant he became just the third quarterback in NFL history with a 125-plus quarterback rating in four straight contests, joining Russell Wilson (five straight games in 2015) and former Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill (four straight in 2019).', 'Winnable Game? The 52 points the Titans surrendered to the Lions were the most the team had allowed since giving up 57 to Houston in 2017.', 'In the Titans’ last two losses, Buffalo and Detroit have combined to outscore Tennessee by a margin of 86-24. The Bills beat the Titans 34-10 last week.', 'The Titans were heavy underdogs in each of those road games, but perhaps things won’t be quite as challenging next Sunday.', 'That’s when Tennessee returns home for the first time since Oct. 13 to face a 2-5 New England team.', 'The Patriots lost starting quarterback Drake Maye to a concussion on Sunday, but rallied behind backup Jacoby Brissett for a 25-22 win over a Jets team that beat the Titans earlier this season.', '']"

"Kalif Raymond, 'the freaking iron man,' enjoys day he deserved",https://www.audacy.com/971theticket/sports/detroit-lions/detroit-lions-kalif-raymond-enjoys-day-he-deserved,"['There\'s a chain-link fence covered in blue canvas that separates the Lions\' practice field from Rotunda Drive in Allen Park. On one side, adults get paid millions of dollars to play a kid\'s game. On the other, the real world rumbles by. Kalif Raymond was walking off the field one day this summer and started ""thinking about what it would be like to drive on the other side of that blue fence and to look in.""', '""So my biggest challenge this year,"" he said ahead of his ninth NFL season, ""is to continue to grow and to not ever let the tiniest bit of complacency or entitlement into my reps, because I could be on the other side of that fence. Not saying it’s a bad thing, it’s just a blessing to be able to walk on this field.""', 'Seven years ago, Raymond walked off the field for what he thought was the final time. After a game with the Giants in 2017, ""I was like, \'I just played my last NFL game.\' I actually told myself that in my head,"" Raymond said.', '""Goodness gracious, I was struggling,"" he said. ""I had a lot of fear, a lot of doubt.""', 'And then he had a choice. Raymond could either ""go in the tank"" and call it quits or empty the tank that offseason. He decided to train so hard that he could accept in good conscious whatever became of his career. He even enlisted the help of family members who fired him punts on a JUGS machine while his mom swatted him with foam pool noodles and yelled in his face as he tried to catch the ball. Raymond still has a video of it on his phone. He re- watched it Saturday night and couldn\'t help but laugh.', ""The next afternoon, Raymond took a punt 90 yards to the house in the Lions' rout of the Titans. He piled up 190 return yards, fifth most in NFL history. He also caught a touchdown for the second week in a row. In Detroit's most complete performance of the Dan Campbell-Brad Holmes era, it's fitting that one of the original pieces on the board was ultimately in the center of the locker room accepting a game ball. Naturally, he shouted out his blockers for also playing their tails off on defense."", 'There\'s no one who loves his teammates more than Raymond. He celebrated Amon-Ra St. Brown\'s extension this offseason by surprising the star receiver outside the Lions\' facility with balloons, silly string, a bottle of champagne and a group of their fellow receivers. Raymond\'s teammates hooted and hollered after Sunday\'s win as Campbell told the story of how Holmes walked into his office in their first offseason in Detroit and told him to ""check out this free agent"" from the Titans. He was a gadget, Holmes said, mostly a returner, but maybe the Lions could find a role for him on offense.', '""I watched 10 plays and I was like, \'Holy sh*t. Whatever it takes, Brad, let\'s get this guy in here,\'"" Campbell said.', ""It didn't take much, a one-year, $1.2 million deal for a player who had 20 NFL catches to his name. Raymond had bounced between five teams over his first five years in the league, spending significantly more time on practice squads than active rosters. He needed an opportunity, the Lions needed players who wouldn't cave under a rebuild. Of the non-draft-picks they imported four years ago, three remain on the roster: Jared Goff, Alex Anzalone and Raymond. The Lions have forged their identity around the selfless, fearless qualities that trio represents. They aren't scared of the work."", 'Raymond\'s return skills immediately stood out to Campbell on film. He moves like a water bug. Campbell also noticed the 5\'8 receiver running a variety of routes out of motion ""and it was just like, \'Whoa!\' ... There was a naturalness about him, and you can’t hide from the speed. But it wasn’t like he was just speed. Man, he\'s a fluid athlete, and at the time we desperately needed it."" When Raymond arrived in Detroit that summer, he figured he had two more years to prove he belonged in the NFL before it moved on without him.', '""I’m closer to out than I am in,"" Raymond recalled.', ""He was the Lions' third-leading receiver in year one, their second-leading receiver and a second-team All-Pro punt returner in year two. He signed a $10.5 million extension ahead of year three that will keep him in Detroit through at least next season. It's hard to envision him anywhere else, because he embodies Campbell's Lions as much as anyone on the team. Raymond has played in every game of the rebuild but one."", '""The freaking iron man,"" Campbell called him. ""Does everything you ask, the greatest teammate, works his ass off.""', 'When Campbell wants his young players to understand what it takes, he tells them, ""Go talk to Leaf. You want to know reality in this league? He’ll give you some perspective."" Undrafted rookie receiver Isaiah Williams followed Raymond\'s every move this summer and forced his way onto the Lions\' roster. Knowing his own struggle to stick in the NFL, ""anything I can do to help my brothers who are out here grinding, I like to give to them,"" Raymond said.', '""So they don’t have to learn the lessons that I had to learn,"" he said. ""They\'re already a step ahead.""', 'Raymond\'s daily goal is to ""make sure you’re not the same player that you were before."" He\'s ever the same person, happy and hopeful, even when the Lions won three games in that first season. Asked this summer if he\'d rather score a touchdown by housing a punt or catching a pass, Raymond said in all sincerity that neither tops the satisfaction of ""just going out there and playing ball."" He took the trouble out of it Sunday by doing both.', '""And the reason I can say that, non-cliche, is because I’ve had a lot of time to not be playing football, I’ve had a lot of times to be cut,"" he said. ""If you see, there’s a blue fence right there.""', 'Raymond is on the right side of it, on the right team.', '', '', '', '', '']"
Detroit Lions’ Kalif Raymond continues to re-write his incredible journey,https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2024/10/27/24281233/detroit-lions-kalif-raymond-continues-to-re-write-his-incredible-journey,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Lions WR Kalif Raymond continues to re-write his incredible NFL journey, and game against the Tennessee Titans is his best work yet.', 'It’s been written before that Kalif Raymond’s journey to the Detroit Lions was one wrought with struggles and strife. His first two years were spent on three different teams, and after getting cut by the third team (the New York Giants), he thought his career was over after just two seasons. After muffed punts and minimal impact, no one would’ve been surprised if his career—like so many others—ended before given the chance to really develop.', '“2016, oh goodness gracious, I was struggling,” Raymond said Sunday night, after his record-breaking performance against the Tennessee Titans. “I had a lot of fear, a lot of doubt. I remember I was walking off the field, I want to say I was playing for the Giants, I was like, ‘I just played my last NFL game.’”', 'But instead of letting that moment define his career, he let the struggles fuel his fire.', '“I had a choice during that offseason: I was like, ‘I could either go in the tank and kinda quit, or I could give everything that I have,’” Raymond said.', 'He chose the latter, and with the help of his extremely supportive family, he landed on the Titans in 2018. He would stay there for the next three seasons. Though he didn’t play in 2018, he had 23 game appearances over the next two seasons in Tennessee, helping them reach the AFC Championship in 2019.', 'Entering free agency in 2021, the Lions were in desperate need of a receiver, and when general manager Brad Holmes showed the tape of Raymond to coach Dan Campbell, they immediately saw the potential.', '“Brad coming into my office in 2021, and early spring we were fresh on the job, and he said, ‘Hey, take a peek at this guy from Tennessee. He’s really a returner, kind of gadget. You think there’s a place for him on offense?’” Campbell recalled. “And I watched about 10 plays, and I was like, ‘Yeah. Absolutely there is, you know. Take this guy in a heartbeat,’ and it’s been a blessing ever since to get Leaf [Raymond] here.”', 'The Lions signed him to a one-year deal. Then they signed him to a two-year deal. And just before entering that second year, they gave him another two years. It’s been six years since he thought his NFL career was over, and he’s thriving more than ever.', 'He’s been part of the Lions’ rebuild from the beginning, and while he may not be a weekly top contributor, he has built a reputation for one of the hardest working players on the team.', '“Guys love him—coaches, players,” Campbell said. “Man, you talk about reliable, and he’s consistent, and the way he prepares, the way he works, and he does everything for us, man.”', 'And against the Titans—his former team, earning him “guest captain” this week—Raymond had his best career game. He became the first ever Lions player to notch a punt return touchdown and a receiving touchdown in the same game. And his 38.0 punt return average against Tennessee is the highest since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger (minimum five attempts). It will, undoubtedly, earn him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors—which would be the second time he’s been named that since becoming a Lion.', 'Last week against the Vikings, the Lions got Raymond more involved in the offense, hauling in three catches for 27 yards and a touchdown. That was a fun game for the 30-year-old receiver. But this one likely topped it.', '“The last two that we played I was telling some of the guys, Minnesota’s like top five (most fun) game all time, then to come follow it up with this one—just to be playing such a team game is so fun,” Raymond said. “Special teams, defense takeaways, offense pushing it in—it’s just really fun to be part of a football team like that.”', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

TWENTYMAN: Week 8 observations,https://www.detroitlions.com/news/detroit-lions-week-8-observations-nowaske-raymond-goff,"['Senior Writer', ""Special teams impact: The Lions' special teams units were magnificent Sunday vs. Tennessee. Kalif Raymond set the NFL record for return average in a single game (38.0) with returns of 64 yards and a 90-yard touchdown on the way to totaling 190 punt return yards in the contest. Khalil Dorsey had a 72-yard kickoff return. Kicker Jake Bates made a 51-yard field goal and was 7-for-7 on extra points. Punter Jack Fox is the first punter in NFL history to average at least 60.0 gross yards per punt and 55.0 net yards per punt in a game with at least five punts."", ""Complementary football: We mentioned the special teams above. Detroit's defense recorded four takeaways - three in Titans territory - to set the offense up with great field position. As a result, Detroit's 225 total yards of offense are the second fewest all-time for a team that scored 49 or more points."", ""No Jamo, no problem: Lions head coach Dan Campbell didn't seem too worried this week talking about the two-game suspension for wide receiver Jameson Williams, saying his offense still had plenty of talent and would be fine. Boy was it. Six different players scored a touchdown Sunday for the Lions. Talk about a complete team effort."", 'Pass rush: The Lions have now had two games to evaluate their pass rush minus Aidan Hutchinson and it should be clear to GM Brad Holmes and Campbell they could use some help before the Nov. 5 trade deadline.

The Lions are hoping November brings more of the same.', 'Hot start: Detroit has started the year 6-1, their best start to a season since 1956.', '""The players, they\'re urgent about it, they\'re accountable to it, and they want more,"" Campbell said. ""And they know when it\'s good and when it\'s not, so that\'s a credit to them, and we still have room to improve, which is great.""', ""Making an impact: Saginaw Valley State product Trevor Nowaske has stepped in and made an impact the last three weeks playing more of the SAM linebacker role in Aaron Glenn's defense. With an interception against the Titans on Sunday, he became first Lions linebacker to total at least 2.0 sacks and an interception over any three-game span in a season since Chris Claiborne in 2001."", ""Dynamic duo: Kerby Joseph recorded his fifth interception of the season Sunday. Now Detroit's safety duo of him and Brian Branch have nine total on the season, which is more than the interception total for 27 teams across the NFL."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'No portion of this site may be reproduced without the express written permission of the Detroit Lions. © 2023 Detroit Lions, Ltd.', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

They were also top five in both passing offense, rushing and third-down efficiency.', '""(We) got Ben (Johnson), he can draw up anything for anybody,"" Raymond said after the game.

We talk about something over and over during the week on coverages and what we\'re expecting, and we get to the game and it\'s exactly what he said it was going to be and he\'s set up things from two weeks prior. It\'s really cool to play on this team and to play for somebody like that who is so detailed and so innovative.""', 'SECOND DOWN: SPECIAL TEAMS IMPACT', ""Dan Campbell values special teams and the importance they have on wins and losses on gamedays.
