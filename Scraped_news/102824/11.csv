No title found,https://www.transparency.ge/en/post/evaluation-polling-and-precinct-closing-process,"['The coalition observation mission of Georgian civil organizations - ""My Vote"" is observing the elections of the Parliament of Georgia on October 26 in all electoral districts throughout Georgia. The mission unites about 2000 people, among them, 150 citizens are involved in observing election stations opened abroad. The observers of the coalition observe the election process throughout Georgia in all electoral districts as well as in the CEC. 133 mobile groups are working in 73 electoral districts. During the day, observers regularly provide us with information about the process at the polling stations on election day, as well as about specific violations and incidents.', 'Key Findings', 'The election day took place in the context of serious and substantial violations. At the end of the day, it became clear that the various problems identified during the monitoring of the election process during the day were part of a larger scheme, the purpose of which was to subvert the final result of the election. It became clear that a complex scheme of election fraud had been developed, for the implementation of which such methods were used as disruption of the verification system, violation of marking procedures and obstruction of observers from observing voter identification procedures. In the first half of the day, two or more ballots were given to voters en masse. Also, there were cases when ballots were already selected in favor of the ruling party.', 'It became obvious that in the pre-election period, numerous reports and media reports about the confiscation and ""renting"" of ID cards, as well as the collection of personal data, served the purpose of implementation of the mentioned scheme. Due to such manipulations it became possible to obtain a decisive number of votes in favor of the ruling party, which we can see now in the results of counting electronic machine checks published on the CEC website.', 'During the day, unprecedented pressure was exerted on the representatives of the monitoring organizations. There were physical attacks, verbal abuse, intimidation, expulsion from the electoral precincts without reason. In most cases, it was impossible to observe the voting process. In some cases, it was even necessary to evacuate the observers. There were cases when the police were also involved in the process of expelling the observer. Consequently, the created environment made normal observation of the election process impossible.', 'Journalists also became victims of violent attacks. Obstructing the journalists at the polling stations while they were undertaking their professional duties served the purpose to prevent fraud schemes from being detected during the election process and the public not to have information about these facts.', 'On the day of voting, there was a concentration of unauthorized persons in the polling stations and their surrounding areas, who were particularly aggressive towards both voters and observers. As always, this time too, in order to pressure and intimidate the voters, the ruling party used criminal groups.', 'During the day, neither the election administration nor the law enforcement bodies reacted to the gross facts of the violation of the law. There was a clear impression that the persons involved in rigging the elections had guarantees that no one would raise the question of their responsibility, even though they committed crimes.', ""The ruling party carried out an unprecedented mobilization of voters by means of vehicles. Unprecedented pressure was exerted on voters. Taking into account that during the pre-election period, voters' personal information was collected, including their social and family status, a large number of voters were literally hostages of the ruling party."", 'Moreover, the polling process was deliberately collapsed due to the lack of sufficient space and the lack of registrars at the polling stations outside Georgia. Voters had to stand in line for hours. Many of them did not even manage to vote, which means depriving our fellow citizens living abroad of their right to vote.', 'As of 22:30, we received the following information from the observers:', '●      347 notifications about the facts of non-implementation of marking and voting without marking;', '●      about violation of voting secrecy - 89 notifications;', '●      341 cases of presence of unauthorized persons in the area were recorded;', '●      physical confrontation/threat/violence - 96 cases;', '●      163 cases of restriction of the observation rights of ""My Vote"" observers.', ""The coalition has identified election districts where substantial violations in the voting process had a systematic character, which could have a significant impact on the free expression of the voter's will. These districts are: Marneuli, Bolnisi, Kareli, Gori, Kaspi, Khashuri, Senaki, Gardabani, Gurjaani, Sighnaghi, Dedoflistskaro, Kobuleti, Sagarejo, Batumi, Telavi, Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku, Akhaltsikhe, Mtskheta, Akhalkalaki, Rustavi, Gldani, Isni, Samgori , at Kharagauli election districts."", 'Such violations include:', '●      Violation of voting secrecy - such facts took place in Kareli, Batumi, Telavi, Khashuri, Bolnisi, Senaki, Gori, Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku, Marneuli, Kobuleti, Sagarejo, Akhaltsikhe, Kaspi, Mtskheta districts;', '●      Voting instead of someone else and repeatedly - in the election districts of Marneuli, Gardabani, Zugdidi, Kharagauli, Chkhorotsku, Samgori;', ""●      Impossibility of observing the correctness of the verification process and the registrar's activities - in Gurjaani, Sighnaghi, Rustavi, Gardabani, Samtredia, Chugureti, Sighnaghi, Dedoplistskaro, Isani, Senaki election districts;"", '●      Handing out more than one ballot per voter and/or placing it in a box - in Gurjaani, Dedoplistskaro, Telavi, Rustavi, Batumi, Senaki, Lagodekhi, Tbilisi, Batumi, Khelvachauri, Kobuleti, Mestia, Akhaltsikhe, Aspindza, Gori, Kareli, Khashuri election districts;', '●      Physical violence - in Marneuli, Gldani, Isni, Marneuli and Zugdidi electoral districts;', ""●      Control of the manifestation of voters' will - in Kharagauli, Chiatura, Akhalkalaki, Khashuri, Mtskheta, Kaspi, Kareli, Khashuri, Gori districts;"", '●      Damage to mobile ballot boxes and ballots - in Vake, Saburtalo, Samgori, Ozurgeti, Rustavi, Khashuri electoral districts;', '●      Non-implementation of marking procedures - in Gldani, Isani, Samgori, Marneuli, Kaspi, Gori, Zugdidi, Marneuli, Batumi, Mtskheta districts;', '●      Agitation by the members of the commission - in the electoral districts of Gori, Marneuli, Bolnisi, Kutaisi;', '●      Disrupting the activities of observers and expelling them - in the election districts of Marneuli, Senaki, Gardabani, Kobuleti, Sagarejo;', '●      Stuffing of ballots in the box - In Marneuli electoral district.', 'For now, 244 complaints have been filed and 183 notes have been made in the record book regarding the violations observed at the polling precincts.', 'Based on the above, as a result of the analysis of the environment in the pre-election period and the fraud schemes used on the election day, as well as the unprecedented impact on the will of the voters and the facts of violence, we believe that the preliminary results published by the Central Election Commission do not reflect the will of the citizens of Georgia.']"

Putin is saying to Ukraine sure, fight us. You die, we die - but in the end you will be like Georgia.'"", 'There is, however, one factor the scheming oligarch apparently did not anticipate – Gen Z.

(He promised them the West would not follow through). ', ""Most importantly, restricting the movements and money of these politicians would signal to the people, so disheartened after the first failure of mass protests in Georgia's modern history, that their voices had been heard."", ""But over the past five months, Europe has allowed Ivanishvili to wriggle free. America has largely pulled its punches too, however at least Washington hit a few dozen Georgian Dream members with travel bans and has reportedly debanked Ivanishvili's family."", ""Across the country Georgian Dream election billboards have been erected with pictures of Ukrainian cities destroyed by Russian bombs under the simple caption: 'Choose peace'"", 'In Brussels, nothing of any note has materialised. Despite the rhetoric, no European country has even imposed a travel ban.

', ""Across the country Georgian Dream election billboards have been erected with pictures of Ukrainian cities destroyed by Russian bombs under the simple caption: 'Choose peace'. "", 'The unspoken message being Moscow is close, the West is far, so keep quiet and accept your fate.', 'As Georgians head to the polls, they are in need of more than warm words from Brussels. ', 'Europe must make good on their promises now – and not after the country has already become Belarus 2.0. Ivanishvili has bet the protesters will become apathetic.

"As Georgia votes, fears of a stolen election and a return to the Kremlin’s orbit loom large",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/europe/georgia-election-russia-europe-intl/index.html,"['', 'At the Joseph Stalin Museum in Gori, the small Georgian town where the Soviet dictator was born, a line of guides is waiting to tell you the story of the local boy who made it big.', 'They can list the birthdays of Stalin’s family and recite the poems he wrote as a schoolboy (for Stalin “could have been a poet, but chose to be a great leader”). But on other things, they are less exact. Of the millions killed in the gulag, “mistakes were made.” Of show trials, they have little to say.', 'So revered is Stalin by some that when the government thought it time to remove his towering statue in 2010, they did so unannounced at night, lest locals protest. But while some older voters in rural towns like Gori might harbor fond memories of life under communism and pine for a Soviet past, they seemed set to be swept away by younger generations who have grown up knowing nothing but democracy, and who are happy to see Stalin consigned to history’s dustbin.', 'Now, as voters in the Caucasus nation cast their ballots in Saturday’s parliamentary election, the specter of authoritarianism looms large once again.', 'Many observers fear the ruling Georgian Dream party will resort to anything to stay in power. It has buried the liberal values it espoused when it took office 12 years ago and effectively torpedoed Georgia’s bid to join the European Union. Its founder, the secretive oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has threatened to imprison his political rivals after the election and ban the main opposition party.', 'After spending years in the shadows, Ivanishvili – who made his billions in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union and served as Georgia’s prime minister from 2012 to 2013 – returned late last year as the party’s honorary chairman and has since given a string of conspiracy-tinged speeches. He claims Georgia is being controlled by a foreign “pseudo-elite” and that the opposition belongs to a “Global War Party” bent on dragging the country into conflict with Russia. This year, Georgian Dream pushed through a Kremlin-style “foreign agent” law, which critics say aims to shut down watchdogs who call the government to account.', 'For many, Ivanishvili’s rhetoric is eerily reminiscent of the past from which many Georgians are keen to escape. And the anti-Western posturing of Georgian Dream, along with the country’s controversial foreign agent law, directly mirrors President Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on domestic political opposition in neighboring Russia.', '“It’s incredible how much of this old Bolshevik, Stalinist language is back. Everybody’s a traitor, everybody’s a foreign agent,” Natalie Sabanadze, a fellow at the London think-tank Chatham House and former Georgian ambassador to the EU, told CNN. She described some of the statements made by Georgian Dream officials as a “copy-paste” of those from Stalin’s show trials. “Have people forgotten what it was like?” Sabanadze asks.', 'In a speech last month in Gori, Ivanishvili also broke a taboo in Georgian society. He said Georgia should apologize for the 2008 war with Russia, for which many Georgians blame Moscow. Russia fought the five-day war in support of pro-Kremlin separatists in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, just north of Gori. Combined with Abkhazia, another breakaway region, Russia today de facto occupies 20% of Georgia’s territory.', 'Ivanishvili said apologizing to Russia would help preserve “12 years of uninterrupted peace” the country has enjoyed under Georgian Dream’s leadership, which he warned the opposition could jeopardize. The message has some appeal to his rural base but sparked a political firestorm.', 'Mikheil Saakashvili, who was Georgia’s president during the war but has been imprisoned since 2021 for abuse of power while in office, called the comments a “betrayal.”', 'Younger, more pro-European Georgians were also outraged. Their earliest memories are not of easier lives under communism, but of Russian tanks rolling into Gori and towards the capital, Tbilisi. Walking out of the Stalin Museum – past his personal railway carriage, past the hut in which he was born – it is easy to find buildings still scarred with bullet holes from the 2008 war. Many buildings still lie in ruins, while Stalin Avenue has been kept pristine.', 'For these Georgians, Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 rekindled memories of Russian aggression in their own country. They want nothing more than for Georgia to slip from the Kremlin’s orbit and continue its march toward a European future.', 'But many fear the government is now heading in the opposite direction, and that Georgia could be on the cusp of returning to the one-party rule from which it escaped a generation ago.', '“The election will be crucial,” Davit Mzhavanadze, a researcher at the Governance Monitoring Center in Tbilisi, told CNN. “If this government keeps power, Georgia will become more Belarusian than European.”', 'At a press conference in Tbilisi on Thursday, Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili – a pro-Western but largely ceremonial figure who has urged Georgians to vote against the government – said she “rules out any outcome other than a victory for the pro-European forces,” citing polls which routinely show that only around a third of the public support Georgian Dream.', 'A question puzzling many is why the formerly center-left Georgian Dream has made a sudden authoritarian pivot.', 'The party’s origin was unusual. It takes its name from a rap song by Ivanishvili’s son, Bera. Although some suspected Ivanishvili – whose net worth is equivalent to about a quarter of the country’s GDP – might pursue a pro-Russian path, during his brief premiership he tacked close to Europe and even promised eventual NATO membership.', '“A modern civil society has been a cherished goal of the Georgian people since we regained our independence 20 years ago,” Ivanishvili wrote in an email to then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012, subsequently leaked. “Unfortunately, old habits are hard to overcome.”', 'That has proved true for his own government, Sabanadze of Chatham House told CNN. Her career is a measure of Georgian Dream’s ideological shifts. As recently as 2021, Sabanadze served as Georgia’s ambassador to the EU. Now, she says she’s troubled by the party’s shift to the right.', 'Having abandoned its liberal origins, Sabanadze said, the party is now “clearly copying” the model of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest this year, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze praised Orban as a “role model,” parroting his claims to defend “homeland, language and faith.” The government has also passed legislation curbing LGBTQ+ rights.', 'But now it is poised to go much further. Ivanishvili has promised a “Nuremberg trial” against members of the opposition, who have been subject to increasing persecution. During street protests in Tbilisi against the foreign agent law, Levan Khabeishvili – chair of the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) – said he was brutally beaten by police. He appeared the next day in parliament, his face blackened and swollen.', 'Khabeishvili has since stepped down as chairman, citing the effect the beating had on his health. He said the assault was meant to intimidate Georgia’s opposition. “Ivanishvili has a Soviet mentality. He’s a Soviet guy,” he told CNN.', 'The Georgian government did not respond to a request for comment.', 'A consequence of Russia’s war in Ukraine was the EU’s decision to offer Georgia candidate status. Brussels, keen to stem Russia’s influence in former Soviet countries, put Georgia – along with Ukraine and Moldova – on an accelerated path to membership.', 'Many say this was despite Georgian Dream, rather than because of it. During protests against the “foreign agent” law, the images of citizens waving EU flags being buffeted back by water cannons put pressure on Brussels to reward the Georgian people, of whom more than 80% support EU membership, polls show.', 'Whether Ivanishvili wanted candidate status is not clear. Joining the EU would require cleaning up the country’s judiciary and giving up power if Georgian Dream is voted out on Saturday. His opponents doubt he is willing to do this.', 'Under the country’s new proportional voting system, Khabeishvili of the UNM says Georgia’s fragmented opposition will have no trouble forming a coalition after the election. But he fears that Ivanishvili will seek to cling to power after an election loss.', 'If this happens, he predicts huge protests in Tbilisi and throughout the country. Here, things could get ugly. Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, said in August that Georgia’s Western allies are plotting a coup to remove Georgian Dream from power. He warned Russia will be on standby to prevent this.', 'For Sabanadze, the stakes could not be higher: How Georgians vote on Saturday, and how the government responds, will determine whether the country remains on a path to Europe or becomes more like Belarus.', '“When I was in Brussels, I thought that Georgia would never become an authoritarian state again, because it’s just something that we find very difficult to accept,” she said. “Georgians will put up a fight. The Belarus scenario will not happen easily.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.\nCNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.', '', '', '']"

The Kremlin likely hopes to seize on Georgian Dream's increasing pro-Russia position to facilitate long-term hybrid efforts to assert control over Georgia and the South Caucasus and diminish Western influence in the region."", ""This paper assesses the implications of a possible Georgian Dream victory in these elections, which would be the most dangerous course of action for Georgia and the West. A Georgian Dream victory is possible but not certain. ISW will offer assessments of Georgia's prospects subsequently if Georgian Dream does not win."", ""Georgia’s October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections will likely be one of the country’s most significant elections since its independence and present the Kremlin opportunities to derail Georgia's long-term Euro-Atlantic integration efforts and reestablish Russian influence over Georgia. The Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections will be the first since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the first since Georgia obtained EU candidate status in December 2023.[1] The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili has said that the elections will have “existential” importance given the increasingly polarized state of Georgian politics and suggested that the elections will determine the fate of Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[2]"", 'Georgia constitutionally enshrined its goal of joining the EU and NATO after the 2003 Rose Revolution — a pro-democracy revolution that sparked Georgia’s pro-Western trajectory. The elections after the Rose Revolution brought the pro-Western United National Movement (UNM) party to power, and its leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, became President of Georgia in 2004.[3] NATO supported Georgia\'s and Ukraine\'s aspirations for membership and their applications for a NATO membership action plan in the April 2008 Bucharest Declaration.[4] Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008 and occupied the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in part to derail Georgia\'s path to NATO membership and to enhance Russia\'s rapidly waning influence in the country. Georgia nevertheless continued Euro-Atlantic integration efforts following the Russo-Georgian War and the 2012 parliamentary elections, which transferred power to Georgian Dream. Georgian Dream initially continued Georgia\'s path towards the EU and NATO, but started to undo some of the progress Georgia had made in its Western aspirations shortly after coming to power.[5] Georgia signed an Association Agreement, including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement (DCFTA), with the EU in June 2014 triggering a set of Russian trade embargoes and information operations aimed at discrediting Georgia’s enhanced EU partnership.[6] Georgia and NATO agreed to deepen cooperation in September 2014 when the alliance endorsed the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package (SNGP) aimed at strengthening Georgia\'s defensive capabilities and developing closer security cooperation and interoperability with NATO members.[7] Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022, and the EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023, although the European Council announced in June 2024 that Georgia\'s accession process was ""de facto halted"" due to ""backsliding on the steps set out in the Commission’s recommendation for candidate status.""[8] Georgian Dream has accelerated its attempts to derail Georgia\'s Euro-Atlantic trajectory following Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.', ""The EU has set key milestones that Georgia must pass before starting actual EU accession talks and progress towards membership can begin, including ensuring a free and fair parliamentary election in October 2024.[9] The October 2024 parliamentary elections will show the elected government's ability, willingness, and interest to advance this pro-Western agenda amid the increasingly Russia-friendly rhetoric that the Kremlin will try to exploit to expand Russian geopolitical influence in Georgia."", '', 'The Kremlin intends to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow\'s geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia. Russia has repeatedly attempted to influence the domestic political landscape of neighboring states formerly part of the Russian Empire and/or the Soviet Union in an effort to exert influence, build a coalition of states opposing the US-led international order, and demonstrate its claimed great power status. Post-Soviet Russian leaders coined the expression ""near abroad"" to describe the former Soviet states as part of an effort to assert Russia\'s supposed right to view those states within its “sphere of influence.”[10] The ""near abroad"" spans the entirety of the post-Soviet space (and Russia\'s claimed sphere of influence reaches into Eastern Europe), and targets of this concept notably include Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Russia aims to establish pro-Kremlin governments in these states in order to secure many of its strategic foreign policy objectives. Russia has attempted to mold the domestic politics of many nearby countries with varying degrees of success since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia has used economic coercion, information operations, political pressures, and most notably military force to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries in its efforts to establish de facto Russian control over the foreign policy and local resources of nearby sovereign states. Russia has occupied Transnistria in Moldova since the fall of the Soviet Union, invaded Georgia and occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, and invaded Ukraine in 2014 to establish breakaway pro-Kremlin territories in eastern Ukraine through which it can project its influence in the victim state. (Russia illegally annexed Crimea outright in 2014 but did not annex occupied areas in Ukraine until September 2022.) Russia’s occupation of territories in these countries has generally followed domestic developments in these states impelling them away from Russian control and toward the West.', ""Russia has increasingly lost its influence in the South Caucasus in recent years, likely explaining its concerted efforts to re-establish this influence particularly through Georgia because of Georgia's pivotal strategic location. The South Caucasus — comprised of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia — has increasingly become an important region for global trade routes, particularly following Western sanctions related to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and has become a space of geopolitical competition and an energy transport hub.[11] Armenia, once one of Russia’s closest allies and one of the countries most dependent on Russia, has attempted to diversify its foreign policy alignments at the expense of Russian influence since its pro-democratic revolution in 2018.[12]"", ""This process accelerated after Azerbaijan launched the 2020 Nagorno-Karabkah War, during which Armenia expected to receive Russian support or at least support from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military alliance, of which it is a member.[13] Moscow did not come to Armenia's assistance in that conflict despite the presence of Russian military bases and forces in Armenia because of the complexities of the relationships among Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey. Russia responded to Armenian anger over the betrayal with information operations blaming Armenia for the war and defeat.[14] Russo-Armenian tensions have grown, leading Armenia to distance itself from security and political ties with Russia including effectively freezing its membership in the CSTO, against the backdrop of Armenia’s pro-democratic trajectory that has often negatively impacted the influence and interests of domestic pro-Kremlin elites.[15] Armenia has recently pursued closer economic, military, and socio-cultural ties with the EU, United States, and non-Western partners in order to reduce its dependence on Russia.[16] Armenian officials have also hinted at the possibility of a hypothetical future Armenian EU membership.[17]"", ""Azerbaijan, for its part, has become an increasingly important energy partner for the EU, particularly following Russia’s re-invasion of Ukraine, increasing its energy supplies to the EU through established trade routes involving Georgia.[18] Azerbaijan has pursued military and political relations with NATO member (and one of Azerbaijan's key patrons) Turkey and has only aligned itself with Russia on select issues while in general maintaining greater geopolitical autonomy facilitated by its geostrategic location on the Caspian Sea, oil-rich economy, and relationships with other powerful states.[19] Russia had limited influence in Georgia after the 2008 Russian invasion and occupation of Georgian territories, but souring Russo-Armenian relations and a more assertive Azerbaijani foreign policy have likely caused Moscow to try to use Georgia to regain influence in the South Caucasus. The Kremlin likely seeks to maintain its political power projection and influence over key trade routes that pass through the South Caucasus as well. Moscow will likely seek to leverage the Georgian 2024 parliamentary elections as a key opportunity."", ""The election results will be crucial in demonstrating Georgia's dedication to implementing reforms related to democracy, the rule of law, and judicial independence that are essential to deepening Georgia's Euro-Atlantic relations. Georgians will elect 150 members of parliament through a fully proportional system, with parties needing to surpass a five percent threshold to win seats.[20] This is the first time that Georgia will be conducting parliamentary elections through a fully proportional system after constitutional changes transitioning Georgia from a semi-presidential republic to a parliamentary system entered into force in 2018.[21] Georgian Dream expressed support for the 2020 elections to be held under a fully proportional system, although Georgian Dream appears to have postponed implementing the change until 2024.[22] The October 2024 election rules prohibit party blocs (pre-election groups of parties that can claim pluralities for the purpose of government formation) – unlike previous Georgian parliamentary elections – and an Edison Research poll indicates that the ruling Georgian Dream party is likely to secure a plurality of the votes.[23] Georgian Dream likely implemented constitutional changes in 2018 to limit party blocs and require a five percent threshold in order to make it more difficult for opposition parties to win seats in parliament or use coalitions as the basis of government formation. Several pro-Western opposition parties, including but not limited to the main opposition Unity - National Movement coalition, are expected to win enough seats in total to comprise a majority in the parliament, but the picture differs from a Georgian Dream-affiliated poll suggesting otherwise[24] Imprisoned former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili founded the pro-West United National Movement party, which leads the Unity - National Movement coalition. The pro-Western Strategy Aghmashenebeli and European Georgia parties are also a part of this coalition. The pro-Western opposition parties are currently fractured, however, reducing the likelihood of an outright defeat of the Georgian Dream party and the victory of a united pro-Western front in the Georgian parliament, possibly setting the stage for Georgian Dream to garner more support in the actual elections than the polls.[25] The Georgian Dream party has ruled Georgia since 2012 with clear or near parliamentary majority.[26]"", ""The Kremlin intends to exploit Georgian Dream to advance Russian influence in Georgia, although the exact extent of Moscow’s current relationship with and possible influence over Georgian Dream and its founder, former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is unclear. The degree of coordination between Kremlin and Georgian Dream is also unclear, and ISW is not prepared to assess the Kremlin's involvement in specific Georgian Dream policies or decisions, although ISW assesses that Ivanishvili very likely has Kremlin ties.[27] The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage Georgian Dream's rhetoric and actions to strengthen Kremlin influence in Georgia and derail Georgia's path to Euro-Atlantic integration, whether or not the Kremlin is directly coordinating with Georgian Dream officials. Russian officials and milbloggers have launched information operations portraying Georgian Dream as the stable choice for Georgia’s future, while suggesting that the party’s victory could lead to territorial reconciliation, including potential compromises on Russian-occupied regions like Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[28] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hinted at this possibility on September 29, signaling that Russia may be open to withdrawing troops under certain conditions.[29] Russia has also eased trade and migration restrictions since 2012 when Georgian Dream came to power, suggesting Kremlin sympathies toward the party.[30]"", ""The assessments in this ISW report consider the most dangerous course of action that the Georgian Dream party can secure an electoral victory and achieve a parliamentary majority. This course of action, although uncertain, remains plausible and would have significant consequences for Georgia's political landscape and Russia’s role in Georgia and the broader South Caucasus. A Georgian Dream parliamentary majority would enable the party to implement its policies derailing Euro-Atlantic integration efforts, which the Kremlin will likely leverage to advance its influence in Georgia and the South Caucasus. Should Georgian Dream fail to gain control of the government, ISW will offer subsequent assessments and forecasts of Georgia's trajectory and Kremlin responses."", 'The Kremlin will likely attempt to leverage the ruling Georgian Dream party\'s increasingly pro-Russian narratives that justify Russian violence against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of post-Soviet countries such as Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. This shift in Georgian Dream rhetoric also offers a possible blueprint for deepening Russo-Georgia cooperation and potential reconciliation without Russian accountability, further distancing Georgia from its Western orientation. Georgian Dream has increasingly positioned itself as favoring the Kremlin, explicitly promoting enhanced Russia-Georgia bilateral ties while gradually distancing the country from its long-standing pro-Western trajectory. Georgian Dream has mirrored Kremlin-driven narratives to justify Russia’s aggression and enhance its voter base by fear mongering. On August 13, Georgian Dream accused Saakashvili of provoking the 2008 Russian invasion and subsequent illegal occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, blaming these Russian actions on Saakashvili\'s UNM party and unspecified ""external actors,"" likely alluding to Western states.[31] Georgian Dream\'s Political Council also pledged to ""inform"" the public about Saakashvili\'s and the UNM\'s allegedly ""treasonous actions,"" blaming them — rather than Russia — for the 2008 Russian invasion. This narrative echoes Kremlin information operations seeking to shift responsibility away from Russia, despite international condemnation of Russia\'s occupation of Georgian territory and violation of its territorial integrity. Russia has frequently alleged that pro-Western and pro-democratic leaders in neighboring countries collaborate with ""external forces,” presumably Western actors, to undermine Russian interests.[32] Russia has simultaneously engaged in lawfare as a means of legitimizing invasions, occupations, and hybrid operations against these sovereign states. A well-known Kremlin-linked Russian military blogger echoed Georgian Dream\'s remarks and reinforced earlier Kremlin accusations against Saakashvili and the West, indicating that this narrative might gain further momentum in the broader information space.[33]', 'Ivanishvili again attributed the 2008 Russian invasion to external actors and the UNM during an election rally held in September 2024 in Gori, a city bordering Russian-occupied South Ossetia.[34] Ivanishvili ostentatiously failed to mention Russia’s aggression and vowed that Georgian Dream would hold UNM accountable should Georgian Dream secure a majority in the upcoming 2024 elections. Ivanishvili notably stated that the Georgian government, under the Georgian Dream party, would seek ""reconciliation"" with South Ossetia and work towards ""forgiveness"" for the alleged violence that UNM caused. Ivanishvili’s rhetoric aligns with the broader Georgian Dream campaign, which portrays the party as a force for peace while framing the opposition, particularly the UNM, as agents of instability and war. Georgian Dream\'s rhetoric explicitly excuses Russian aggression in Georgia and plays into Russian information operations attempting to shift blame from Russia\'s violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity onto domestic actors. This Georgian Dream rhetorical line directly copies the Kremlin\'s position on Russia\'s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Russian invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022 and supports Moscow\'s claims that the domestic policies of post-Soviet states are by themselves sufficient casus belli to justify Russian invasions.', ""Georgian Dream’s electoral campaign has also recently used controversial visual propaganda, featuring images of buildings that the Russian military has destroyed in Ukraine, including the aftermath of the Mariupol Drama Theatre strike, under the caption “choose peace.”[35] These ads further emphasize Georgian Dream's supposed narrative of peace, contrasting it with the alleged war-mongering of opposition parties, all while aligning with pro-Kremlin rhetoric by implicitly blaming Ukraine for Russia's full-scale invasion and for the horrors and war crimes Russia has committed in the course of that invasion. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry (MFA) condemned on September 26 Georgian Dream's new campaign banners criticizing the instrumentalization of Ukrainian suffering.[36]"", 'The Georgian government has also reiterated standard Kremlin information operations accusing Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces of ""terrorism"" and ""conspiracy to overthrow the government"" in an attempt to portray associates of Ukrainian forces as threatening Georgian national security. The Georgian State Security Service (SUS or SSSG) reportedly recently summoned several Georgian citizens who had served as volunteers alongside Ukrainian forces for questioning on charges of ""conspiracy to overthrow the government"" and ""terrorism"" on July 19.[37] Article 410 of Georgia\'s criminal code forbids mercenarism, but Georgian authorities notably did not charge these former volunteers under that article. The Kremlin routinely uses the narrative of a “violent coup” in Ukraine to misrepresent Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity and protests for Ukrainian European integration, and SUS activities increasingly mirror Kremlin rhetoric. The decisions by Georgian authorities and the SUS to question and charge its citizens who have fought in Ukraine indicate that the Georgian Dream ruling party likely intends to derail long-term Georgian efforts for Euro-Atlantic integration, which plays into continued Russian hybrid operations to divide, destabilize, and weaken Georgia.[38]', 'Georgian Dream has already forwarded pro-Russian policies and enacted laws that mirror Kremlin-style governance, thereby setting conditions to strengthen relations with Russia while distancing Georgia from its Western allies. The Georgian parliament passed a “foreign agents” law in May 2024 requiring NGOs receiving at least 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as ""foreign agents,"" with penalties for non-compliance.[39] The law bears a strong resemblance to Russia\'s foreign agents law that also requires civil society bodies to register as “foreign agents” to let the Kremlin monitor and restrain pro-democracy, anti-Kremlin activities in Russia.[40] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov defended Georgia\'s Parliamentary majority for reintroducing the foreign agents law, stating that it is normal for sovereign states to prevent foreign interference in their domestic politics.[41] EU High Representative Josep Borrell warned in March 2023 and May 2024 that the adoption of the bill would ""negatively impact"" Georgia\'s membership prospects — likely the desired effect from the Kremlin\'s perspective.[42] Georgian parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili announced on October 3, 2024, that he had signed a ""family values"" law, echoing Kremlin-style initiatives to implement restrictive measures under the guise of protecting ""traditional values"" from alleged foreign threats.[43]', 'Georgian Dream announced on August 20 most significantly that it will ban all pro-Western opposition groups — particularly targeting the main opposition party, UNM — if it secures a constitutional majority (113 out of 150 parliamentary seats, as opposed to 76 seats to create a parliamentary majority).[44] Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze stated that the ban would include all major opposition parties essentially leaving Georgia with a one-party parliament.[45] Such a ban would eviscerate representative government in Georgia and presumably establish the Kremlin-friendly Georgian Dream party permanently in control.', ""Georgia has notably refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia despite supporting UN resolutions and offering limited rhetorical support for Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion.[46] Then-Prime Minister and leader of the Georgian Dream party Irakli Garibashvili publicly rejected the idea of sanctions in February 2022 and argued that they were ineffective and would harm Georgia’s economy.[47] Members of the Russian Federation Council's International Affairs Committee subsequently praised Garibashvili's position.[48] Although Georgia’s economy is indeed dependent on Russia in key sectors such as trade, tourism, and remittances, Georgian Dream officials have not only highlighted these economic realities but also leaned on pro-Russian rhetoric to justify their refusal to join international sanctions.[49] Georgian Dream rhetoric has often mirrored Russian talking points, downplaying the effectiveness of sanctions and adopting a more sympathetic stance toward Moscow, rather than focusing solely on Georgia's economic interests and needs."", ""The Kremlin will likely leverage success in realigning Georgian foreign policy with Moscow to advance Russian political, military, and economic influence in the South Caucasus and Black Sea region and leverage these areas to support its war effort in Ukraine. Since Georgian Dream came to power in 2012, and particularly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, trade relations between Russia and Georgia have notably increased. Russia has emerged as one of Georgia's largest import and export partners, ranking among the top five in both categories.[50] Russia gradually lifted previous trade embargoes, including those on Georgian wine, signaling its willingness to cooperate with the Georgian Dream party despite the fact that the two countries have not had formal diplomatic ties since the 2008 Russian invasion.[51] Transparency International's Georgian bureau reported in February 2024 that Russia accounted for 10.8 percent of Georgia's total exports and 13.3 percent of its total imports.[52] The study also noted a large increase in Russian businesses registered in Georgia since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian citizens have been able stay in Georgia without a visa for a year since 2012 — one of the most liberal residency laws for Russian citizens in the world.[53] Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted the ban on direct flights between Russia and Georgia in May 2023 and abolished the visa regime for Georgian citizens to stay in Russia first in 2023 and then expanded the scope to include Georgian labor migrants in October 2024.[54] "", 'Russia may seek to exploit improved economic relations with Georgia to expand its sanctions evasion capabilities and mitigate the impacts of Western and international sanctions. Reports suggest that Georgia\'s increased trade with Russia and the flow of goods through its borders could be aiding Russia\'s war effort in Ukraine. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\'s (RFE/RL) Georgian Bureau, echoing a February 2024 US Senate Investigation, reported on March 5, 2024, an analysis of Georgia\'s import and export data from the past two years.[55] The analysis indicated that Georgian imports of crucial Western dual-use ""critical components"" required for Russia\'s military operations have significantly surged since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine suggesting that Russia may be acquiring them via Georgia. The Georgian government denied these allegations noting that the importation of dual-use commodities was well below the levels of pre-COVID pandemic years and that the surge was simply a sign of economic recovery and re-establishment of trade.[56] A Georgian opposition outlet noted, however, that while the Georgian government’s claims are likely true, Georgian re-exports of critical dual-use components have notably increased to countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan through which Russia has acquired dual-use materials.[57] A Georgian Dream victory in future elections is likely to continue this trend, positioning Georgia as one of the bases for possible Russian sanctions evasion and further entrenching Russia\'s economic influence in the South Caucasus. This deepening relationship risks undermining international efforts to isolate Moscow economically and could shift the region’s balance of power in favor of Russia.', ""The Kremlin will likely seek to leverage the potential of a Russia-friendly Georgian government to secure long-term access to Georgian territorial waters and ports in the Black Sea after Ukraine's Summer-Fall 2023 strike campaign against the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) successfully curtailed Russian naval operations in the Black Sea. Ukrainian missile and drone strikes targeting BSF assets in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea, in Summer and Fall 2023 forced Russia to relocate vessels to Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. Ukrainian drones also targeted Novorossiysk in August 2023, demonstrating Ukraine's growing ability to disrupt Russian operations across the Black Sea.[58] Russia subsequently began to shift some naval assets to the eastern Black Sea and to expand the small Russian military port in occupied Ochamchire, Abkhazia. Georgian leadership, including former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, condemned Russia’s actions in occupied Ochamchire, and the Georgian MFA called the port a violation of sovereignty and urged compliance with the 2008 EU-mediated ceasefire.[59] Breakaway Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania announced on October 5, 2023 an agreement with Russia to construct a permanent naval base in occupied Ochamchire[60] Deputy Chief of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Major General Vadym Skibitskyi reported on October 23 that Russian authorities started dredging and constructing port infrastructure in Ochamchire in order to construct a base for some warships currently stationed in occupied Crimea, which could not be redeployed to Novorossiysk[61] The base's expansion will reportedly take over two and a half years to complete, but the Russian BSF reportedly began utilizing the Ochamchire port even before full construction, suggesting the urgency for Russia of gaining access to Georgian Black Sea facilities. International naval activities-focused outlet Naval News reported in July 2024 that satellite imagery from July 2024 purportedly showing a Russian Project 22870 support ship docked at Ochamchire, indicating Russia’s commitment using the port.[62] The Russian military is likely intending to develop the existing port into a subsidiary rather than a main base since the surrounding terrain largely consists of sandy beaches unsuitable for the construction of naval infrastructure.[63] Russia might seek to use this small port for small-scale operations and to allow a limited number of vessels to evade Ukrainian strikes, even though Georgian officials have thus far opposed these actions. A Russia-friendly Georgian government that ceases to voice meaningful criticisms of the Russian port in occupied Abkhazia would likely allow Russian authorities to more rapidly expand port infrastructure with fewer denunciations from the Georgian government and the international community."", ""The Kremlin may also be interested in long-term access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports to expand Russia's economic and military influence in the Black Sea region. The Kremlin may attempt to leverage a Russia-friendly Georgian government to gain access to larger Georgian ports such as Batumi and the planned deep seaport in Anaklia. A Russian flagged cargo ship entered Batumi Port in July 2022, and the Georgian Maritime Transport Agency and Economy Ministry stated that international sanctions against Russia for its war in Ukraine did not apply to the ship or the shipping company.[64] A Russian cruise ship attempted to dock in Batumi Port in July 2023, raising concerns and causing controversy about Russia’s increasing presence in Georgian territorial waters.[65] Russia likely has long-term interests in expanding commercial and military access to larger Georgian Black Sea ports that can dock large military and commercial vessels — unlike the Ochamchire port — in order to address current Russian vulnerabilities and expand influence in the Black Sea region at large. These ports offer no military support and limited commercial support in the short term but over time could play a key role in Russia’s broader Black Sea strategy. If Georgian Dream's policies favor rapprochement with Moscow, it could further enable Russian commercial and naval operations in the Black Sea. Georgian Dream's pre-election rhetoric emphasizing reconciliation with Russia and downplaying Moscow’s responsibility for the 2008 war could rhetorically set conditions for increased for Russian access to regional ports and enhanced Russian influence in this sector of the Black Sea."", ""The Kremlin may seek to secure long-term access to Georgian territory, airspace, and ports by normalizing relations with Georgia though negotiating the return of Georgia's occupied territories. RFE/RL, citing unspecified Russian and Georgian analysts, reported in June 2024 that Russia could negotiate a return of occupied Georgian territories under the condition that Georgia renounces its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.[66] ISW cannot independently confirm the veracity of the claims. The floating of such rumors, however, clearly mirrors the ongoing Russian demands in Ukraine intended to coerce Ukraine to give up its Euro-Atlantic and particularly NATO aspirations in return for Russia's cessation of its invasion.[67] Russia notably did not attempt to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russia after illegally seizing them despite select Russian officials' threats to do so since 2008.[68] Russia likely refrained from annexing the occupied territories in order to attempt to integrate the Russian-controlled territories into the Georgian state as a means whereby Russia could exert direct control over Tbilisi. The Kremlin attempted to leverage the Russian-preferable 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements with Ukraine to integrate Russian occupied territory into the Ukrainian state to destroy an independent Ukrainian state and bring it under Russian control.[69] Russia would likely leverage such an agreement with Georgia to justify its occupation of and influence over Ukraine and Moldova, if Georgia and Russia started such negotiations, moreover, using Tbilisi's surrender as a model for Kyiv and Chișinău.[70] Russia could instrumentalize Georgia’s coerced renunciation of Euro-Atlantic integration to enhance its influence in Georgia and particularly Georgian territorial waters and infrastructure in the Black Sea without facing meaningful domestic and Western pushback if such rumors are accurate. Russia could also leverage land and air routes passing through Georgia to facilitate sanction evasion schemes and expand access to trade routes, including to Armenia and Iran. Rumors suggesting Georgian territorial reconciliation, however, could also be a part of Georgian Dream campaign effort to sway voters in their favor or a Russian information operation intended to affect the outcome of Georgian elections as the Russian Foreign Ministry continues to portray warming Georgia-Russia relations as false.[71]"", '', ""Russia's strategic efforts to enhance its economic influence in Georgia could serve a broader agenda of infiltrating key elements of the Middle Corridor, an informal but increasingly vital trade route connecting Europe and Asia circumventing Russia. The Middle Corridor offers a promising alternative to traditional trade routes between Asia and Europe amid increasing Western and international sanctions against Russia. With worsening EU-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the worsening situation in the Middle East, the EU is eager to reduce reliance on Russian-controlled and other unstable trade routes, making the Middle Corridor, a set of trade routes which passes directly through the South Caucasus, increasingly important for European trade and security.[72] This trade route, supported by major Western infrastructure investments and the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Belt and Road Initiative, has significantly reduced transit times. The Middle Corridor cuts transit times to 14 to 18 days, compared to 19 days through Russia or 22 to 37 days via southern sea routes, making it an attractive option.[73] Cargo volumes through this corridor increased by nearly 65 percent in early 2023, surpassing one million tons. Georgia has emerged as a pivotal hub in this network, playing a vital role in transporting oil, gas, and goods along the Middle Corridor. Russia’s growing interest in Georgian ports, its occupation of Georgian territories, and its increasing trade ties with Georgia pose significant risks. These efforts could enable Russia to destabilize the Middle Corridor, using Georgia to undermine the trade route and reassert its influence in the region. The success of the Middle Corridor hinges on the stability and security of Georgia and the surrounding region, leaving it vulnerable to Russian interference, despite significant investments by the PRC and the EU. Russia could indirectly disrupt this key trade route and undermine efforts to establish a stable alternative to Russian-controlled corridors if Russia gains influence over the Georgian government."", ""A Georgian Dream parliamentary victory giving it a majority and the subsequent possible pursuit of an overtly Russia-friendly Georgian foreign policy would be a major setback for the West, as it would enable Russia to enhance its war effort, bolster its economic capacity, and showcase soft power, all the expense of Western interests. A Caucasus Barometer survey conducted by the Caucasus Research Resource Centers (CRRC) in April and May 2024 reported that 70 percent of Georgians support EU membership and 57 percent of Georgians support NATO membership.[74] Despite this widespread support for Western integration, the policies and rhetoric of the ruling Georgian Dream party have already caused Western countries to limit aid and cooperation with Georgia. The US Department of Defense (DoD) reported on July 5 that it would indefinitely postpone the Noble Partner joint military exercise with Georgia due to the Georgian government’s accusations that the US and Western entities pressured Georgia to open a second front against Russia and participated in coup attempts against the ruling Georgian Dream party.[75] In light of these allegations, the US also initiated a comprehensive review of its bilateral relations with Georgia.[76] EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawel Herczynski announced on July 9 that the EU had suspended Georgia's accession process.[77] The EU delegation in Georgia announced on October 8 that the country would lose 121 million euros ($130 million) in EU funding due to democratic regression.[78] The European Parliament overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on October 9 condemning Georgia's democratic backsliding and threats to political pluralism.[79] The resolution called on the European Commission to assess Georgia’s adherence to visa-free regime criteria and urged EU member states to impose targeted sanctions on Ivanishvili. UK Ambassador to Georgia Gareth Ward announced on October 15 that the UK had frozen its annual security dialogue with Georgia and canceled defense talks over concerns about the country's democratic backsliding.[80] This suspension comes after widespread criticism of Georgian Dream’s legislative actions. Such developments indicate that the trajectory Georgia is on — should Georgian Dream secure a majority — will not only likely reshape the country’s EU and NATO ambitions but also fortify Russia's influence at the expense of the aspirations of the Georgian people and Western strategic interests in the region."", 'A parliamentary victory for a more Russia-friendly party in Georgia would represent a significant soft power victory for Russia, showcasing its ability to coerce neighboring countries and deter them from pursuing Western integration paths in the long run. It would also show that the Kremlin is able to leverage the invasion and partial occupation of neighboring states to shape their political orientations. Increasing Kremlin alignment in a post-Soviet country that has long sought Western integration would further cement the long-standing Russian portrayal of its now-sovereign former colonies as vassal states – a framing that seeks to deter both domestic interest in Western cooperation and Western willingness to pursue closer relations with these countries. A victorious Georgian Dream that pursues more Kremlin-friendly policies would also demonstrate a remarkable Kremlin capability to reverse decades of European integration efforts in a country that Russia has attacked and victimized, which would likely embolden Kremlin efforts to pursue hybrid operations and open aggression against Ukraine, Moldova, and other post-Soviet countries.', ""The Kremlin's attempts to assert control over Georgia through hybrid operations are part of a broader coordinated Kremlin effort to gain control over post-Soviet countries to form a coerced coalition of vassal states against the West. The Kremlin's efforts to gain suzerainty over Georgia are part of an interconnected effort to use hybrid and military means to destabilize Ukraine and Moldova and forcibly coerce them into Russia's asserted sphere of influence. Russia could achieve its objective of influencing Georgia through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means should the Kremlin succeed in leveraging a potential Russia-friendly majority in the Georgian Parliament. Such a success through soft power and non-kinetic hybrid means would likely inform future Kremlin calculus and decision-making on operations against target countries including, but not limited to, Ukraine and Moldova."", '', '[1] https://www.consilium dot europa.eu/en/policies/enlargement/georgia/', '[2] https://civil dot ge/archives/621729', '[3] https://www.dw com/en/georgia-the-thorns-of-the-rose-revolution/a-67536678', '[4] https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_8443.htm', '[5] https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/georgia-russia-internal/georgia-and-russia-why-and-how-save ;

"Who is Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy billionaire behind Georgia’s pivot to Russia?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/who-is-bidzina-ivanishvili-the-shadowy-billionaire-founder-of-georgian-dream,"['Country’s wealthiest and most influential figure has guided shift away from the west while cultivating an air of mystery', 'In the winding streets of ancient Tbilisi, one is ever under his watchful gaze. From a hilltop glass mansion, likened by critics to a Bond villain’s lair, Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s wealthiest and most influential figure, has guided the country’s shift away from the west over more than a decade.', 'With his party’s latest victory in the pivotal parliamentary elections on Saturday, that trajectory appears set to continue for years to come, sparking warnings from opponents that Ivanishvili plans to dismantle Georgia’s fragile three-decade experiment with democracy while blocking any viable path to EU integration.', 'Since his short tenure as prime minister from 2012 to 2013, the secretive oligarch, whose wealth is estimated to be $7.5bn in a country whose GDP is $30bn, has largely exerted his influence from behind the scenes and is widely described by many Georgians as the country’s “puppet master”.', 'But Ivanishvili grinned widely in public on Saturday night at his party’s HQ as the country’s election commission announced that the ruling Georgian Dream party he founded had won 54% of the vote, a result that will secure its hold on power for another four years.', 'After his speech, fireworks lit up the sky, their loud bangs echoing through the city, highlighting the despair of an opposition whose hopes of forming a pro-western coalition lay in ruins.', 'Ivanishvili spent much of the 1990s in Russia, founding banking, metals and telecoms companies and becoming wealthy in the chaotic aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.', 'When he returned to Georgia and entered politics, he cultivated an air of mystery. His eccentric hobbies, including keeping sharks and zebras and collecting rare trees, gained widespread attention, turning stories of his lavish pursuits into household tales across the country.', 'As he said once in a rare interview: “I could tell you anything and you wouldn’t be able to check it.”', 'Ivanishvili took a more visible role in the run-up to Saturday’s election, which was widely seen as a watershed vote that could determine whether Georgia shifts away from its long-held western orientation towards stronger ties with the Kremlin.', 'The oligarch’s public comeback coincided with a sharp escalation in his party’s anti-liberal and anti-western rhetoric.', 'In a recent interview laced with transphobic and homophobic rhetoric reminiscent of far-right online forums, Ivanishvili portrayed Georgia as locked in a cultural struggle against the west, accusing it of attempting to impose corrosive values on the nation.', 'He claimed parents in Europe put pressure on children to undergo gender affirmation surgeries, and that “men’s milk” for babies was regarded as “the same as women’s”.', 'Ivanishvili advised those who doubted his claims to watch footage of a pride event in Barcelona, alleging that it featured young children present and “all sorts of orgies”.', 'He also framed his party’s election campaign around accusations that the west, along with the local opposition, was attempting to drag Georgia into a Ukraine-style conflict, a potent message in a country where many fear war with Russia after Vladimir Putin’s troops briefly invaded the country in 2008.', 'Ivanishvili’s critics and those who once worked with him warn that behind his bombastic rhetoric lies a real danger.', 'They point to his pledges to ban all major opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers after the elections, labelling them as “criminals” and “traitors”.', '“It is very simple, Ivanishvili actually does what he says. He promises to outlaw and jail his opponents and have no reason to doubt he will try to do that,” said Tina Khidasheli, who served as defence minister in a Georgian Dream-led government from 2015 to 2016 and has since become a critic of Ivanishvili.', 'As his rhetoric hardened, so too did his paranoia. While once comfortable with large crowds, Ivanishvili now travels with a large security cordon, delivering his speeches behind bulletproof glass.', '“Staying in power is an existential matter of survival for Ivanshvili,” said Kornely Kakachia, the director of the Georgian Institute of Politics. “He believes that if he loses, his opponents will go not just after his political power but also after his business empire.”', 'Pointing to the Russian origins of his wealth, opposition parties have long accused Ivanishvili of loyalties to Moscow.', 'Under his leadership, Georgia enacted a “foreign agents” bill that targeted western-funded NGOs, alongside anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, both measures bearing notable similarities to laws passed by the Kremlin years earlier.', 'However, seasoned observers have warned against oversimplifying the narrative by framing him as merely a puppet of Putin.', '“He is appeasing Russia, but I see no reason to suggest that he is owned or run by Russia and that’s an important distinction,” said Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe and an expert on the region.', 'Instead, de Waal says Ivanishvili’s tactics mirror those of Viktor Orbán, the divisive leader Hungary. De Waal pointed out that Orbán and Ivinishavili have centred their campaigns on conservative “Christian” values while calling for “peace” in Ukraine without condemning Russia.', 'Tellingly, Orbán was the first foreign leader to congratulate the Georgian Dream for an “overwhelming victory,” hours before official results were announced.', 'For now, Georgia’s immediate future remains uncertain. On Sunday morning, Georgia’s opposition refused to concede defeat, accusing the ruling party of staging a “constitutional coup” and calling for protests. This sets the stage for a potential political crisis in a country with a history of mass unrest.', 'There is little doubt that Ivanishvili has leveraged his seemingly limitless finances to influence the elections, which have been marred by allegations of irregularities, including reports of coercing state employees to vote and instances of vote buying.', 'Still, the outcome suggests that Ivanishvili’s messages resonate with a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in the industrial heartlands and conservative poorer regions, where economic progress has been slow and the allure of Europe seems distant and faint.', '“It is tempting for the opposition to dismiss that Ivanishivli’s party has no support, that they completely bought the elections,” said one western official in Tbilisi. “But the reality is that Ivanishvili appears to have won this battle for the time being.”']"

There’s also the possibility that none of the parties on the ballot paper will be able to form a government on its own and a coalition will be necessary. ', 'Close watchers of Georgian politics say Saturday’s election is a pivotal moment for a country that, like other former Soviet republics, has found itself pulled between a future aligned with Russia or the West, and where political polarization has become pronounced.', '“All sides agree the upcoming elections are a critical moment for Georgia’s future,” Ketevan Chachava, non-resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said in commentary earlier this month.', '“The governing Georgian Dream Party’s rhetoric toward the West — its founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, calls the West the “party of war” and says it forced Georgia and Russia into confrontation — has alarmed pro-European groups, international partners and observers, highlighting a broader struggle between pro-European and pro-Russian forces,” she noted.', 'The Georgian Dream-led government has enacted various policies of late that have gone against the grain of its previous ambitions to join NATO and the European Union and have instead aligned it with Moscow, with the introduction of what critics and opposition parties decry as repressive laws stifling media freedoms, civil society and the rights of sexual minorities.', 'The introduction of a Russia-style law on foreign influence in May — and a brutal police crackdown on subsequent protests at the bill — was particularly contentious, and seen as the most obvious example of Georgian Dream’s slide toward a Kremlin-like style of governance.', 'The government has since doubled down on perceived Western influences in domestic politics, saying it would seek to ban all pro-Western opposition groups if it secures a constitutional majority in this weekend’s election.', 'Despite its increasingly anti-Western rhetoric, Georgian Dream insists it still wants Georgia to join the EU and its election posters feature the party’s logo along with the symbol of the EU.', 'The party’s founder and de facto leader, the billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has said the country should only become a member of the EU “through dignity,” and must not go to war with or sanction Russia, or harm its economy in the process.', 'Polls suggest the majority, around 80%, of Georgia’s population support membership of the EU, with around 67% supporting membership of NATO, putting a significant proportion of Georgia’s 3.8 million people at odds with a government that has appeared to turn its back on those aspirations.', 'The Georgian government’s perceived backtracking on human rights and democratic principles have put it in direct conflict with Washington and the EU, which have imposed sanctions on Georgian officials, and put Tbilisi’s EU accession talks and funding on ice as a result. It’s a rapid fall from grace as Georgia only obtained EU candidate status in December 2023.', 'European lawmakers warned this month that “democracy is at risk” in Georgia, and have told Georgian Dream it must “roll back undemocratic legislation in order to make progress in its relations with the EU,” a statement from the European Parliament earlier in October noted.', 'European lawmakers see the upcoming parliamentary elections as “decisive in determining Georgia’s future democratic development and geopolitical choice” and its ability to make progress on its EU member state candidacy, the European Parliament noted.', 'Analysts have widely described Georgia’s election as a referendum “for or against Europe,” but it could also be viewed as a vote for or against remaining within Russia’s sphere of influence and closer geopolitical and economic relations with Moscow.', 'The specter of Georgia’s former Soviet overlord certainly looms large over the vote, with Moscow seen to have exerted a stronger influence over the ruling Georgian Dream party in recent years, and particularly since it launched its invasion of fellow former Soviet republic and pro-Western Ukraine in February 2022.', 'Georgian Dream refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia after the war began and founder Ivanishvili has pitched the election as a choice between peace and war, casting the West as a “Global War Party” that would suck Georgia into a conflict with Russia, as he said it had done with Ukraine.', 'Moscow will be watching the outcome closely, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Monday, noting that the Kremlin intends to leverage any Russia-friendly Georgian government “to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow’s geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia.”', '“The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken,” the ISW noted.', 'Georgian Dream and pro-EU groups have both looked to rally supporters ahead of the vote, holding rallies in the capital Tbilisi in the last week.', 'Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili, staunchly critical of the ruling party, addressed crowds of supporters last weekend, telling them that the vote would “demonstrate people’s will for freedom, independence, and a European future.”', '“Here today is the society, the people, the Georgians who are going to Europe,” Zourabichvili told the crowd, many of whom were draped in EU and Georgian flags.', 'Meanwhile, Georgian Dream founder Ivanishvili sought to demonize the pro-Western opposition at a rally Wednesday, telling crowds of pro-government supporters that if Georgian Dream won the election it would make opposition parties “answer with the full rigor of the law for the war crimes committed against the population of Georgia,” Reuters reported, without specifying what crimes they had committed.', 'Tbilisi’s pre-election environment has been increasingly polarized, analysts say, setting the stage for heightened tensions around the election result, whatever the outcome.', 'An additional complicating factor is recent electoral reform, which means the 150 seats in Georgia’s parliament will be awarded under a fully proportional system, with parties needing to surpass a 5% threshold to win seats.', '“In addition to recent poll results, the switch to a fully proportional electoral system makes it difficult to imagine GD’s [Golden Dream’s] outright victory or the opposition’s complete defeat,” Tina Dolbaia, Benjamin Shefner, and Maria Snegovaya of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in analysis last week.', '“The most likely scenario, according to this logic, would be a coalition government in Tbilisi, curbing GD’s power. However, there are significant concerns over electoral malfeasance, including vote buying, ballot stuffing, carousel voting, misusing the state and administrative resources, and depriving citizens living outside of Georgia of the right to vote,” the analysts noted.', '“Additionally, even if the civil society manages to overcome these obstacles on election day and GD fails to secure a majority of seats, the political environment in Georgia is still deeply polarized. If the opposition refuses to form a single bloc after the elections, GD may remain the most powerful party in the parliament.”', 'Got a confidential news tip?

Georgia’s Interior Ministry said it launched an investigation and the Central Election Commission said a criminal case had been opened and that all results from the polling station would be declared invalid.', 'Ahead of the parliamentary election Ivanishvili — the shadowy billionaire who set up Georgian Dream and made his fortune in Russia — vowed again to ban opposition parties should his party win.', 'Georgian Dream will hold opposition parties “fully accountable under the full force of the law” for “war crimes” committed against the people of Georgia, Ivanishvili said at a pro-government rally in Tbilisi, Wednesday.

Many Georgians fear Georgian Dream is dragging the country toward authoritarianism and killing off hopes it could join the EU.', 'The election is “not just about changing government, it is about whether Georgia survives or not because Ivanishvili’s government means Russia,” said Nika Gvaramia, leader of Coalition for Changes, an opposition group before polls closed.', 'Ivanishvili voted Saturday morning under heavy security. He did not respond when asked by the AP if he wanted to form an alliance with Russia.', 'He said the election is a choice between a “government that will serve you,” or “choosing agents of a foreign country which will fulfill the requests of the foreign country only.” Ivanishvili did not indicate which country he was referring to but ahead of the election he and his officials claimed a “Global War Party” was seeking to influence the EU and the U.S., widen the conflict in Ukraine, and force Georgian Dream from power.', 'The opposition parties ignored Zourabichvili’s request to unite into a single party but signed up to her “charter” to carry out the reforms required by the EU to join.', 'The governing and opposition parties told voters they would pursue EU membership even though laws passed by Georgian Dream have put that hope on hold.', 'At the EU summit last week, EU leaders said they have “serious concerns regarding the course of action taken by the Georgian government.”', 'Georgian Dream stood against three coalitions: the Unity National Movement, the Coalition for Changes Lelo, and Strong Georgia.', 'The Gakharia for Georgia party, set up by former prime minister Giorgi Gakharia, said it will not go into an alliance with anyone but will support the opposition to form a government if they win enough votes.', 'Reuters', '© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Refusing to recognize the official results and dismissing the contest as a “Russian special operation,” pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili called on Georgians to come out in protest on Monday. Will Georgian Dream consolidate power and pull Georgia further toward Russia and away from Western institutions? What’s next for the opposition?

Zourabichvili is right not to recognize them.', 'Andrew D’Anieri: In the election’s aftermath, Georgians’ civil liberties are at stake', 'Georgia’s authoritarian-minded ruling party Georgian Dream, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has dubiously claimed victory in the country’s October 26 parliamentary elections, while the pro-democracy opposition has asserted fraud and the election-monitoring mission of the respected Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has cited extensive efforts to intimidate voters and manipulate the results. Tensions in the country are high, as are the chances of government repression to retain power. ', 'Credible exit polls published on October 26 (from Mtavari and Formula TV) gave Georgian Dream 41 percent and 42 percent percent of the vote, respectively. The official Georgian Central Election Commission announced on October 26 that Georgian Dream had won with about 54 percent, at odds with this credible exit polling.', 'The elections occurred against a background of mounting authoritarian threats and actions by the Georgian government, including threats to outlaw opposition parties and a law putting pressure on civil-society groups that receive foreign funding. ', 'Georgians have consistently and over many years expressed their desire to integrate with Europe and NATO. Russia has for years sought to undermine this option, using economic pressure, disinformation, and, in 2008, war. Russian propagandists have boasted that the October 26 elections marked a defeat for Western efforts to engineer “regime change” in Georgia. ', 'Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili, who has publicly supported the democratic opposition, condemned the elections on October 27, characterizing the official results as illegitimate and the product of Russian efforts to subordinate the country. She announced a public demonstration for the evening of October 28.', 'The Georgian government is likely to press ahead with its claims of victory. The opposition demonstration on Monday is likely to be huge. Violence, instigated by the authorities directly or through surrogates, could ensue.', 'The United States and Europe (not counting Hungary’s pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who congratulated Georgian Dream even before the government announced the results and may visit Tbilisi on Monday) face a crucial set of decisions. The West must decide how to characterize these patently bad elections, how to respond to the ruling party’s repression (including the potential for a Belarus- or Venezuela-style scenario of retaining power through force), and how to support the Georgian people in both the immediate period ahead and the longer term. ', 'The United States has reportedly prepared sanctions against Georgian leaders, including Ivanishvili, which it will probably employ in the event of government-instigated violence or the government remaining committed to election fraud. The key variable will be whether Georgian society has the determination to resist, on a sustained basis, the imposition of authoritarian rule.', '—Daniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former US assistant secretary of state for Europe.', 'I traveled to Georgia to serve as one of the International Republican Institute’s short-term observers for the country’s parliamentary elections. As I witnessed first-hand, fears that the ruling party, Georgian Dream, would use aggressive and illegal tactics to secure a victory were realized.  ', 'Leading up to the election, there was a systemic and pervasive intimidation campaign. One of the most common stories I heard was employers forcing employees to turn over their IDs to either prevent them from voting or so those IDs could be used to commit voter fraud.', 'On Election Day, rules limiting campaign materials and campaigning near polling stations were unabashedly ignored. The most glaring violation I saw was in the town of Tkibuli, where a large screen displayed a video of the Tbilisi mayor, a Georgian Dream member, giving a speech, his voice ringing out over the city’s loudspeaker system. In addition, at most of the polling stations I visited, groups of people hovered outside watching voters come and go, creating an air of surveillance. They were often large, intimidating-looking men, in groups of three or four, not talking but simply watching. ', 'We also witnessed the activities of what appeared to be fake observer organizations deployed to “monitor” the elections. In the small town of Satsire, I met a woman working for one roughly translated as the “Georgia Lawyers Barristers International Organization.” For an hour and a half, we observed her approaching voters and walking them to the side of an adjacent building where she couldn’t be seen. When we asked her what she was doing, she hurriedly walked away while a different man who had also been “monitoring” the station demanded we leave. Worse, inside every single station I visited I witnessed a small video camera pointed at the voting booths or at the ballot boxes. I was told they were set up by Georgian Dream or election officials, purportedly for security and to prevent ballot stuffing.', 'This all sent a very clear message: We are watching. ', '—Leslie Shedd is a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and the president of Rising Communications.', 'The battle for Georgian democracy is now headed for the streets, which is exactly where most observers have long expected it to end up. After an election marred by what international observers called vote buying, double voting, and voter intimidation, the ruling Georgia Dream party’s claim to have won a parliamentary majority lacks any legitimacy. In fact, it is absurd. Moreover, Zourabichvili’s refusal to recognize the result, and her call for street protests, fully and firmly aligns the largely ceremonial presidency, the only institution of the Georgian state that has not been captured by Russia, with Georgia’s pro-Western opposition. ', 'The battle lines are drawn. So what happens next? If Zourabichvili’s allegation that Georgia is the victim of a Russian special operation is correct—and few serious observers of the region doubt that this is the case—it stands to reason that the Kremlin and its Georgian proxies have a plan for the day after, as well. ', 'Georgia’s 2024 parliamentary election has entered its “Maidan” phase. There are three possible outcomes: This could lead to a redux of Georgia’s 2003 peaceful Rose Revolution in which street protests ousted a corrupt and authoritarian government. It could lead to a violent crackdown and suppression of the democratic opposition, with covert Russian assistance, as was the case in Belarus in 2020. Or it could provide the pretext for direct Russian intervention, as in Ukraine in 2014. More than two decades after Georgian civil society came of age in the Rose Revolution, the country is headed for another decisive round. This weekend’s deeply flawed election was just the opening bell.', '—Brian Whitmore is a nonresident senior fellow in the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, an assistant professor of practice at the University of Texas-Arlington, and a founder and host of the Power Vertical Podcast.', 'Georgia’s Central Election Commission (CEC), a government agency, reported that the ruling Georgian Dream has received about 54 percent of the votes so far. Opposition leaders have expressed concerns that CEC could be under pressure from the ruling party during these pivotal elections. Now CEC is under scrutiny from the public because of the widespread violations that took place in voting districts outside of big cities in Georgia, which have cast doubt on the legitimacy of these elections. ', 'It is indeed suspicious that in a country where 79 percent of the population supports EU membership, 54 percent would vote for a party that has been driving a wedge between Georgia and its Western partners, most recently by adopting the controversial foreign-agent law and offshore law. ', 'Before accepting the highly contested election results, the international community should question the legitimacy of the elections. ', 'Violations such as ballot stuffing and voter intimidation appear to have had what one watchdog group called “a significant impact on the election results.” Both Transparency International and the International Society for Fair Elections and Monitoring have reported that 10 percent or more of the votes were impacted by “systemic fraud” and “widespread rigging.” ', 'As the Georgian public and international observers navigate the challenging process to ensure that the Georgian people’s votes are accurately counted, Western policymakers should keep two things in mind:', '1. The Georgian people are doing all they can to keep the country on a Western course, including by voting and volunteering to observe the elections, but they are not on a level playing field.', '2. Pushing Georgia away from the West will only benefit the Russia-China-Iran axis, which could turn Georgia into an economic black hole if the Georgian government supports the evasion of sanctions and export controls. ', '—Maia Nikoladze is an associate director at the Economic Statecraft Initiative within the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center.', 'The official CEC results of the Georgian parliamentary elections have raised significant concerns regarding the integrity of the electoral process.', 'As Georgian domestic observation organizations and international observers have noted, the elections were marred by manipulation of the results through the strategic use of intimidation, surveillance, and targeted interventions in vulnerable areas of the voting system. It strains credulity to believe that the Georgian Dream party would receive its highest numbers since the 2012 election after massive protests this spring over its foreign-agent law and amid high voter turnout.', 'Eoghan Murphy, head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) ODIHR election-observation mission, concluded that the parliamentary elections were not “in line with international democratic principles.” Considering the typically restrained standards of the OSCE’s commentary on elections, the ODIHR statement was remarkably critical for a diplomatic organization and outlined evidence that supports many of the claims made by national organizations and international observers.', 'I echo Zourabichvili’s assertion that the elections were a “Russian special operation,” and she is right not to recognize the results. The people of Georgia deserve free and fair elections that are not marked by the kinds of irregularities that both national and international observers observed on Saturday.', '—Laura Linderman is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and a senior fellow and program manager at the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at the American Foreign Policy Council.', 'This weekend’s parliamentary elections in Georgia went largely according to the grim forecasts of many experts. The ruling Georgian Dream party appears to have cheated, mainly through widespread voter intimidation, particularly in small cities and rural areas. The Georgian Dream-friendly electoral commission declared the ruling party the victor, opposition voters and parties credibly alleged electoral fraud, and Tbilisi looks set for mass street protests Monday evening. Things could get ugly if the government deploys the new crowd-control materiel it has bragged about or if it deploys thugs to beat up protesters as it did in May.', 'At stake in the aftermath of this disputed election is nothing less than Georgians’ civil liberties. Egged on by Ivanishvili, Georgian Dream has already passed laws to harass civil-society organizations and to largely criminalize homosexuality, both of which the party could use to stifle dissent and jail political opponents if it remains in power. Georgian Dream’s “foreign-agent law” and “LGBTQI+ propaganda law” are lifted directly from the Russian playbook. But the ruling party won’t stop there. Its leaders have pledged to pass legislation to ban opposition political parties and codify a Belarus-style one-party autocracy.
