If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.', 'Kathrin Ziegler / Getty Images', 'The full article continues below these offers from our partners.', ""Thanks to the Federal Reserve's historic rate-hike campaign between 2022 and 2023 aimed at taming post-pandemic inflation, rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) surged to 20-year highs last fall—reaching above 6%. But now, inflation has cooled, and the Fed has shifted to a rate-cutting phase. As a result, CD rates have been declining, with the top nationwide rate recently slipping to 5.50%."", ""Unfortunately for savers, the Fed is expected to follow up its September rate cut with one or two additional cuts still this year, and likely multiple reductions in 2025. The Fed could even keep cutting rates into 2026, as you can see from Fed members' forecasts in the chart below.\n1"", ""This potentially long rate slide is precisely why today's top CDs—especially multi-year certificates—are such a smart move right now. By locking in one of today's rates, your return on those funds will be insulated from whatever moves the Fed makes in the next year or two—whether that's one rate cut or ten."", ""Also in your favor is that rates on the best nationwide CDs continue to be attractive. Though returns have softened a bit from their peak, the top CDs are still paying historically high returns. Just compare today's rates below to the rates on a CD opened in early 2022."", ""Our daily ranking of the best CD rates always provides you with a list of the highest nationally available offers. Right now, the top returns are available on shorter-term CDs. But since odds are high that interest rates could enter a two- to three-year decline, it's smart to lock in a rate today that's guaranteed for two years—or even longer if you feel confident that you can live without access to the cash."", ""Here are our roundups of today's hottest rates that will guarantee your annual percentage yield (APY) into 2026, 2027, or even through 2028–2029. For further details on any of these CDs, click the link to our list of the best offers in that term."", 'You have one additional option to (almost) get you to a 2026 rate guarantee. The top APY among 1-year CDs is actually offered for 14 months. Paying 5.05%, this CD from Spectra Credit Union would lock your rate until late December 2025 if you snag it soon.', ""Whatever CD decision you land on, don't delay! Another Fed rate cut is possible on Nov. 7, so time is of the essence. Any given CD offer can evaporate overnight, so once you've decided on opening a CD, lock in your guaranteed rate as soon as possible."", ""If you're not able or willing to lock up any savings for 15 months or more, you can still benefit from today's historically high rates. One way is by putting money in a shorter-term CD, depending on your timeline:"", ""As you can see, some of these CDs pay higher rates than you'll find with the longer-term CDs. While that makes them near-term winners, you'll lose when your short-rate guarantee runs out."", ""For money that you need to keep fully accessible and can't commit to a CD, consider a high-yield savings account. Our daily ranking of the best savings account rates reaches up to 5.50% APY, with more than a dozen additional offers paying 5.00% or more."", 'Savings account rates are variable, meaning they can change at any time. Right now, the top high-yield savings account rate is just below a 20-year high. But with more Fed rate cuts imminent, savings account rates will drop.', ""Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000."", ""Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

They allow you to lock in rates before they fall, and at the end of the term, you get your money back, plus interest. But there can be drawbacks to these products that can be a net negative for your finances.', ""Here are three places I'd rather put my cash than a CD, and why they work."", '', ""High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) have comparable -- and in some cases, higher -- rates to CDs, but without the requirement that you leave that cash alone for months or even years. And since I'm favoring liquidity as I work toward my various financial goals, including rebuilding my emergency fund, that's a major win. (Emergency funds are best stored in accounts that you can tap into when you need them.)"", '', ""It's worth noting that if rates fall going forward, as is expected following the Fed's benchmark interest rate cut, HYSA rates will also likely fall since they come with variable APYs.

This amount is meant to stay in the account so that if an invoice isn't paid on time, I'll have enough money to pay my bills."", ""Although checking accounts aren't usually known for paying interest (meaning my cash would technically be losing money over time, due to inflation), the best checking accounts often pay at least some interest, with a low barrier to earn the highest rate. That way, you can still hedge against income fluctuations (as well as financial stress) while preserving as much value as possible."", 'Saving for retirement may not give that relatively quick satisfaction of getting returns on your investment. But given enough time, it can turn even small contributions into major funds for your post-working life.', ""Roth IRAs also offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement in exchange for giving up a tax cut in the year you make contributions.

After 25 years, you'd have about $26,000.

Although nobody can predict the future, here's where I think 1-year CD interest rates will head over the next year, and why."", '', ""To be perfectly clear, CD yields don't have a direct relationship with the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. Banks set their own CD rates. But the Fed's rate moves affect how much it costs banks to borrow money, so they usually influence the direction of CD yields."", '', ""Shorter-term CDs, which include 1-year CDs offered by top-notch online banks, tend to follow the Fed's rate movements closely."", ""On Capital One's Secure Website\n."", ""On American Express's Secure Website\n."", ""On CIT's Secure Website\n."", '', 'It\'s not a coincidence that the federal funds rate (the rate that is being referred to when someone says the Fed ""cut rates"") is set at a target rate of 4.75% to 5.00%, and some of the top banks on our radar offer yields just under that range.', 'Check out our updated list of the best CD rates to see how much yield you can get right now.', ""Now, this isn't an exact science. After all, in the 2020-2021 era, when the Fed held rates at near-zero levels, it was still possible to find a 1-year CD with a yield greater than 1% from reputable online banks. But the point is that short-term CD rates track the Fed's moves closely, as opposed to longer-term CDs, whose yields are mainly based on future expectations for the interest rate environment."", ""This is why 5-year CDs typically pay less than comparable 1-year CDs right now, although the former was by far the higher-paying CD before the Fed's rate-hike cycle began in 2022."", 'Nobody has a crystal ball that can tell us exactly what the interest rate environment will be at the end of 2025. After all, at the start of 2022, virtually nobody expected the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise its benchmark rate to combat inflation, but it happened.', ""Having said that, the latest expectations from the policy makers at the Fed call for a total of a 150-basis-point reduction in the benchmark federal funds rate by the end of 2025, which would result in a target range of 3.25%-3.50%. And while it's somewhat of a rarity, financial markets seem to agree. The median expectation priced into financial markets is for that exact target range, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool."", ""Considering that the top 1-year CD rates right now are in the 4%-4.5%% range as of this writing, my prediction is that we'll see 1-year CD yields in the 3%-3.25% range from the highest-paying online banks at the end of 2025."", ""Of course, this depends on the actual trajectory of interest rates between now and then, and it's important to keep in mind that banks set their own rates on CDs and high-yield savings accounts. In other words, even if interest rates fall considerably, there's nothing preventing a particular bank from offering a 4% or higher promotional yield on a 1-year CD."", ""But based on the current expectations for interest rates, I think it's fair to expect 1-year CD yields in the low-3% range at the end of 2025."", 'Matt is a Certified Financial Planner™ and investment advisor based in Columbia, South Carolina, and has been writing about personal finance since 2011.', 'SHARE THIS PAGE', ""We're firm believers in the Golden Rule, which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers.

In other words, there's no rule that says a bank has to lower its CD yields if the Fed decides to cut its rate."", ""Having said that, they do tend to move in the same direction over time. The Fed's rate cuts make banks' borrowing costs lower, and this generally means banks are willing to pay less for deposits like CDs."", ""Short-term CDs tend to be the most sensitive to the Fed's interest rate decisions, while long-term CD yields tend to move more gradually. The simplified explanation is that shorter-term CDs are largely based on the current interest rate environment, while longer-term CDs mainly get their yields from expectations for interest rates throughout the term."", 'This is why 5-year CDs generally have lower yields than 1-year CDs right now -- the expectation is that interest rates are going to continue to fall over the next few years.', ""We've certainly seen some CD yields come down, but they really haven't dropped as much as you might expect. As of this writing, 9-month CDs with yields of 4.35% or higher are still available from some well-known and top-rated banks, and on the longer-term end of the spectrum, 5-year CD yields of 3.50% or more are rather easy to find."", ""It's also worth noting that if you're willing to use the absolute highest-paying banks, CD rates have barely budged since the Fed's rate cut.

However, it's important to keep in mind that the Fed is widely expected to keep lowering interest rates in a series of reductions lasting for at least another year."", ""If it does, it's likely that we'll see CD yields gradually head lower, so if you have cash in a savings or money market account you aren't likely to need anytime soon, now could be a great time to consider a CD."", ""This credit card is not just good – it's so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

"", ""But a CD is not the best place to put money you're saving for a far-off goal, like retirement, or college if your kids are very young. In these situations, investing your money is generally a better bet because the stock market has historically delivered higher returns than CDs.

You can still lock in a CD at somewhere around 4.5% or 4.75%. For a $5,000 deposit, that means earning $225 or about $237 on a 12-month CD. But if you have money you don't plan to use for many more years, you may want to skip the 4.5% or 4.75% CD and instead put money into a stock portfolio immediately so you can have the chance to generate stronger returns. "", ""If you invest $5,000 in an S&P 500 index fund that delivers a 10% annual return, in 15 years, it'll be worth about $20,900. But if you wait even one year to make that investment and only get to invest your $5,000 over 14 years at 10%, you're looking at $19,000 instead. That $1,900 difference is way more than what you'll make in the next 12 months on a 4.5% or 4.75% CD. So you may want to open a great brokerage account instead of tying your cash up in a CD."", ""It's natural to be bummed about missing out on the top CD rates that were available through the summer.

The economy has largely held up, and the S&P 500 has continued on its tear, rising another 22% so far this year. Sure, 5.1% return hasn't been bad.

A decrease in the federal funds rate, say close to or below the current inflation rate of 2.4 percent, can be bad for savers. Namely, it can translate to lower APYs on many CDs and savings accounts. Meanwhile, a fed rate cut can be good for borrowers as interest rates tend to decrease on loans.', 'This year, top CD rates have been declining gradually due to strong signals from the Fed that it would cut interest rates.

Here’s an overview of how CD rates are changing, followed by a guide to the current top CD rates across different terms.', 'Related: Compare the Best CD Rates', 'A CD is similar to a savings account, but the interest rate is fixed—not variable. The other major difference is that you’ll typically only earn interest on a CD account if you refrain from withdrawing funds during the term. That term could range from a few weeks to several years, depending on the CD you choose.', 'If you withdraw money from your CD before it “matures” (reaches the end of its term), you’ll likely get hit with steep penalties in the form of reduced interest. For instance, you may forfeit six months’ worth of interest if you withdraw money from a one-year CD before 12 months are up.', 'If you’re interested in accruing the maximum amount of interest possible, consider long-term CDs, which historically have the highest APYs. But again, long-term CDs are only an option if you’re willing to stash away some cash you won’t be able to touch for years.', 'Generally, CDs with longer terms carry more severe withdrawal penalties than short-term CDs. For instance, it’s not uncommon to lose a full year’s worth of interest if you transfer funds out of a five-year CD account before the term is over. Therefore, it’s crucial to familiarize yourself with the CD issuer’s penalties before you open your account.', 'For short-term savings goals, three-month CDs might make sense. The current average rate on a three-month CD sits at 1.32%, but the highest rate is 5.30%. Last week, three-month CDs were earning 1.32% on average.', 'If you’d prefer a CD with a shorter term than one year, today’s best rate on a six-month CD is 5.25%. The top rate was the same last week. The current average APY for a six-month CD is 1.86%, the same as last week at this time.', 'APY provides a more accurate picture of the annual interest you’ll earn with a CD because it factors in compound interest. That’s the interest you earn not only on your deposit (or principal) but also on the interest itself.', 'The highest interest rate currently being offered on a one-year CD—one of the most popular CD terms—is 5.37%. If you find a one-year CD with a rate in that neighborhood, you’ve found a good deal. One week ago, the best rate was the same.', 'The average APY, or annual percentage yield, on a one-year CD is now 1.87%, the same as a week ago.', 'If you can hold out for two years, 24-month CDs today are being offered at interest rates as high as 4.76%. The top rate last week at this time was a similar 4.76%. Two-year CDs now have an average APY of 1.64%. That’s the same as last week at this time.', 'CDs with longer terms tend to have some of the most attractive interest rates and APYs—if you’re willing to keep your money locked away for years.', 'Today’s highest rate on a three-year CD is 4.65%, so you’ll want to shop around for that rate or something near it. Last week at this time, the best rate on a three-year CD was also 4.65%.', 'On a five-year CD, the highest rate today is 4.46%. APYs are averaging 1.57%, the same as this time last week.', 'The longer the term, the harsher the early withdrawal penalty. It’s not unusual to lose one full year’s worth of interest or more if you break open a five-year CD too soon. Be absolutely certain you understand the penalty before you make your investment.', 'The best rate on today’s jumbo CDs is 5.25% for a 6-month term. The average APY for this category of CD is currently 1.91%, compared to 1.80% last week.', 'Most jumbo CDs require a minimum deposit of $100,000—and some even require $250,000. However, there’s no universally agreed-upon definition regarding what qualifies as a “jumbo” CD. Some banks and credit unions slap the label “jumbo” on CDs you can open with $50,000, $25,000 or even less.', 'Related: CD Interest Rates Forecast: How Good Will They Get?', 'Opening a CD account requires a lump-sum deposit, which you can also think of as an investment. Many CDs and share certificates (the credit union equivalent of CDs) have minimum deposit requirements that must be met. That amount can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the institution.', 'Once your account is open, your principal begins occurring the fixed interest rate for the entirety of the term. Banks and credit unions generally send you paper or electronic statements displaying how much interest you’ve earned.’', 'Since the goal is to let your money grow, try not to even think about accessing it if you can help it. But if you do need to crack your CD open, be prepared to pay early withdrawal penalties in the form of interest earned. In rare cases, you may also lose a percentage of your principal to early withdrawal penalties.', 'Want to earn higher yield, but wary of keeping your money chained up for years? A CD ladder can help you earn good returns and make your investment feel more liquid.', 'You build a ladder by investing your money in multiple CDs with terms of different lengths. You might buy a one-year CD, a two-year CD, a three-year CD, a four-year CD and a five-year CD. As each of the shorter-term CDs matures, you replace it with a new five-year CD.', 'Follow this plan, and in a few years you’ll have one better-yielding five-year CD maturing each year. If you’re ever having a bad year, you could take some of the cash from the expiring CD and use it to pay bills instead of pouring it all into a fresh CD.', 'You must comparison shop to track down the best CD rates. Banks and credit unions compete by offering alluring yields to land your business, so shopping around is a must before you purchase any bank CD or credit union share certificate.', 'Curinos determines the average rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) by focusing on specific CDs and excluding others. Certain types, such as promotional offers, relationship-based rates, private, youth, senior, student/minor, affinity, bump-up, no-penalty, callable, variable, step-up, auto transfer, club, gifts, grandfathered, internet-only and IRA CDs are not considered in the calculation.', '', '', ""With more than 15 years of experience crafting content about all aspects of personal finance, Michael Benninger knows how to identify smart moves for your money.

That means your earnings won’t drop if overall rates fall. But the longer you wait, the lower the APY you may be able to get.

Terms of one to five years or longer can help you lock in today’s highest APYs before interest rates inch lower.', 'Rate of return. Look for the highest APY for the term you’re interested in. The APY is the amount of interest the CD earns in a year — including compounding. Unlike a savings account, CD rates are fixed, meaning they won’t change over the life of your term.', 'Minimum deposit. While you can find CDs without minimum starting deposits, some CDs require $100 to $1,000 to open an account. Generally, if you have the money for a higher initial deposit, you can earn a higher APY — just be sure that amount isn’t a hardship on your budget.', 'Type of bank or financial institution. Today’s best interest rates are offered by digital banks, with few exceptions among traditional brick-and-mortar banks or credit unions. If you aren’t comfortable with an online-only bank, look to a high-yield savings account or money market account offering a high rate without withdrawal penalties.', 'Penalties and fees. Life happens, and you might find yourself needing to tap into your money before the CD matures.

Many banks and financial institutions offer CDs at rates that are higher than you’ll earn with the average savings or money market account — with digital and online banks offering the highest rates on average.', 'Range of CD terms. You can find CD terms of three months to five years or more to fit your financial goals. Rates for six-month CDs can outpace the average bank account, and longer terms offer rates comparable to the best high-yield savings accounts.', 'Penalty for early withdrawals. If you need to access your money before your CD term expires, you face fees equal to several months of interest — as much as three to six months’ worth, depending on the account and your term.', 'Not the highest investment returns.

The difference is called a spread, and it’s what banks rely on to make money. Unlike a traditional savings account that allows for flexible movement of your money without penalty, a CD requires you to lock in your deposit over a specified period of time, returning your principal plus interest after the account matures. That lock-in period — and penalties that discourage your early withdrawal — allows a bank to better plan how long it has to make money off your deposit, and it’s typically willing to pay a little more for that reliability.', 'Yes.

Fed rate cuts will likely lead to lower interest rates on savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs)."", ""However, there's some good news. Recent economic data indicates that Fed rate cuts could proceed more slowly than previously expected. This could mean that CD rates might not fall as rapidly as many people fear they will."", ""Want to lock in today's high CD rates? Click here for our up-to-date list of CD rates from top online banks."", ""According to the CME FedWatch tool, which analyzes interest rate expectations that are priced into financial markets, there's a 94% probability that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points (one-fourth of a percentage point) in November. A month ago, there was a roughly 30% chance that the rate cut would be twice that size."", ""A similar adjustment in expectations has occurred for the December Fed meeting. A month ago, the markets were pricing in a 64% probability that we'd see at least 75 basis points in rate cuts by the end of 2024. Now, the probability of this happening is indicated at 0%."", 'In a nutshell, the Fed is expected to continue cutting rates, but at a significantly slower pace than was previously expected.', 'The reason is that economic data has generally come in stronger than expected. For example, in the most recent CPI inflation data release, the annual inflation rate of 2.4% was slightly higher than expected. When September jobs data was released a couple of weeks ago, we not only learned that 254,000 jobs were added during the month vs. an expectation of 150,000, but that wage growth was better than expected.', ""The Federal Reserve's job is to control inflation and maximize employment. With lower inflation and strong jobs data, there simply isn't much of a need to aggressively cut interest rates."", 'To be perfectly clear, CD rates aren\'t directly tied to the Fed\'s interest rate decisions. However, the benchmark federal funds rate (the rate people refer to when saying ""the Fed cut rates"") impacts how much it costs banks to borrow money, so it also affects how much banks are willing to pay for deposits.', ""In short, CD rates and the Fed's benchmark interest rates typically move in the same direction."", 'So if Fed rate cuts occur at a slower pace than previously expected, it would likely cause CD yields to do the same. To be clear, it would still be wise to expect CD rates to generally trend lower over the next year or two, but it could certainly happen more slowly than many had been expecting.', 'Along with the rate cut in September, the members of the Federal Reserve released their economic projections, which among other things, include expectations for future interest rate activity.', ""The median expectation for the end of 2025 is a total of 150 basis points of rate cuts (1.5 percentage points) compared with current levels. If this were to happen as expected -- and believe me, that's a big if -- I would expect short-term CD rates and high-yield savings account interest rates to move by about the same amount."", ""On the other hand, longer-term CDs, such as those with 5-year CD terms, tend to have rates that are primarily based on expectations for future interest rates.

You can buy and sell Treasurys through a brokerage account quickly without forfeiting interest already earned.

Yields on 3-month bills are 4.6%, and while some banks are offering similar or slightly higher rates still, many have much less attractive yields. According to DepositAccounts by LendingTree, the average 3-month CD yield is 1.9%.', 'In terms of duration, Browne said that short-end T-bills are better than durations in the middle or long end of the yield curve, at least for the time being, with the Fed only having cut 50 basis points so far.', '""Right now I don\'t see a lot of benefit of going further than six months,"" he said. ""I just think the further you go, you\'re getting paid significantly less for something that has duration risk, and it can give you less liquidity, therefore.""', 'Over the next year, however, Browne sees short-end yields becoming less attractive as the Fed cuts, and more medium-term yields rising as a soft-landing scenario — his base case — comes more into view for investors.', 'Typically, fears about a recession push down yields on longer-duration bonds as higher investor demand for safe assets raise the price of the securities. Recession concerns are elevated at the moment with the labor market weakening, but Browne believes those clouds will clear in the months ahead, lowering investor demand for longer-duration bonds, causing their yields to rise.', 'So, buying short-duration T-bills in the meantime buys you time while longer yields rise, he said.', '""Our feeling is that we\'re going toward a more normal yield-curve environment,"" Browne said.

CD Maturing Soon? Act Fast to Avoid This Common—and Costly—Mistake,https://www.investopedia.com/cd-maturing-soon-act-fast-to-avoid-this-common-and-costly-mistake-8732269,"['We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.', 'AlbertoChagas / Getty Images', 'The full article continues below these offers from our partners.', ""Whenever you have a certificate of deposit (CD) about to mature, it's smart to give it time-sensitive attention to ensure your money earns a good rate. And right now, there's added reason to be on the ball—rather than play catch-up later and likely lose money in the process."", ""Most maturing CDs are automatically rolled into a new CD at the same institution—unless you give other instructions by the bank's deadline. Unfortunately, default CDs for roll-overs tend to pay sub-par rates, which means your inaction could result in being locked into a new CD term you may not want, at a rate that could be much lower than you could earn elsewhere."", ""Today's declining interest rate environment adds to this problem. The Federal Reserve already cut interest rates by a half percentage point at its meeting last month, and it's expected to reduce its benchmark rate by another quarter or half point still this year.\n1\nAs a result, the best CD returns have been falling for months and are likely to continue drifting lower."", 'While automatic CD rollovers sound convenient, they strip you of options. First, they stop you from earning higher rates that are available elsewhere. Second, they essentially double the time your money is locked away. A 1-year CD turns into a 2-year commitment, a 2-year CD into a 4-year commitment, and so on. By not rolling over, you can take control of your money and make choices that are best for you right now.', ""Every certificate of deposit has its own maturity date based on the term you chose and the date it was established. The maturity date is when you can freely withdraw your money—including all the interest you've earned—without incurring an early withdrawal penalty."", ""Several weeks before that date rolls around, the bank or credit union where you hold the CD will contact you, often by letter but perhaps by email or secure message. With a reminder of the date your term ends, they'll provide instructions on how to tell them what you want done with your funds. They may provide a reply form and envelope and/or instructions for making your wishes known through online banking or a telephone call."", 'With most institutions, there are usually four options:', ""To accomplish any of the first three, simply submit your instructions to the institution by the deadline stipulated. But if you do nothing or fail to act in time, you'll get the fourth option—and you may not like the result."", ""Most institutions offer a grace period for newly opened CDs. So, if you've missed the deadline and your funds have been moved to a new certificate, you may be able to undo the rollover if you act quickly enough. Grace periods vary by institution but typically range from five to ten days."", 'Whether or not you move your money into a new certificate, here are four steps to make the best moves with your existing CD.', ""Perhaps you're unsure about committing your maturing funds to another CD, such as if you need or want to keep the money accessible for something else. In this case, a smart alternative is socking it away in a high-yield savings account. The best of these currently pays up to 5.50% APY, giving you an excellent return while leaving the funds completely available for when you need them."", 'But with more Fed rate cuts likely this year—and also expected in 2025—rates on savings accounts will decline. Returns above 5% may fade away in the coming months and could fall much lower than that next year.', ""That makes a new CD at one of today's top rates a great option if you can get by without the funds for a while. Since CDs offer you a locked-in rate guarantee, it won't matter how often the Fed cuts interest rates. Your CD will keep paying its advertised annual percentage yield (APY) until it matures."", ""According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, a majority of interest rate traders currently predict the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate by another 0.25 percentage points on Nov. 7, and then an additional quarter point on Dec. 18. They also expect additional reductions in 2025.\n1"", ""If you want another guaranteed rate from a CD, start shopping around as soon as you get that tickler notice about your expiring CD. First, look up the rate you'd get on the CD you'd roll into. Then, look at our rankings of today's best CD rates to see how the returns compare. This can also help you decide CD term length you prefer, given today's best offers."", ""If your existing CD won't mature for, say, another month, note that the rates you see advertised on the institution's website today may not still be available when your CD actually matures. Since rates are likely to decline, the APY on your maturity date could turn out to be much worse. This is another argument for taking control of your funds rather than letting them roll over."", ""If you can't decide what to do with your CD funds before maturity, instruct the bank to transfer the CD balance into a savings account at that institution or another one where you have an account. This is smart no matter what you plan to do next because it will be easy to transfer the money from savings to any other bank. Even if you ultimately decide to open a new certificate at your existing bank, you can easily do this with the money you moved into savings."", ""If you decide to take the plunge with a new CD, it's smart to quickly lock in the best rate you can find for a term that suits your financial timeline. With rate declines already hitting the CD market and further reductions looming, the sooner you lock in a new CD, the higher the APY you're likely to get."", ""In fact, if your existing CD isn't maturing for a while and you can afford to be temporarily double-committed, you'd likely benefit from opening a new CD now—even if your current certificate hasn't yet matured. This could let you lock in a better rate now than you can probably secure several weeks down the road."", ""Anytime you open a new CD, set a reminder on your calendar six to eight weeks before its maturity date. This will alert you to start the process early enough to make an educated and intentional decision on what to do with the maturing funds. It will also help you realize if the bank hasn't sent you a timely notification on how to submit your instructions."", 'We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available:', 'Best 3-Month CD Rates', 'Best 6-Month CD Rates', 'Best 1-Year CD Rates', 'Best 18-Month CD Rates', 'Best 2-Year CD Rates', 'Best 3-Year CD Rates', 'Best 4-year CD Rates', 'Best 5-Year CD Rates', 'Best High-Yield Savings Accounts', 'Best Money Market Accounts', 'Note that the ""top rates"" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions.

Will Interest Rate Cuts Make CD Yields Plunge in 2025?,https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/banks/articles/will-interest-rate-cuts-make-cd-yields-plunge-in-2025/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Published on Oct. 22, 2024', 'By: Matt Frankel, CFP®', 'Writer, Analyst', 'KEY POINTS', ""The Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years, and many savers are worried that yields on CDs, high-yield savings accounts, and money market accounts are set to plunge. While it's true that the interest rates offered by banks tend to move in the same direction as the Fed's moves, the relationship isn't a perfect one, and it's important to realize that we're unlikely to see the rock-bottom interest rates of 2021 and earlier again anytime soon."", ""With that in mind, here's a rundown of the latest interest rate expectations from the Fed, how Fed rate cuts impact CD yields, and why CD yields might not plunge as much as you think in 2025."", '', ""Do you want to lock in today's high CD yields? Check out our updated list of the best CD rates from top banks right now."", '', ""I'll get right to it. The benchmark federal funds rate is currently set at a target range of 4.75%-5.00%.

After all, the peak of the federal funds rate during the last (2016-2019) rate hike cycle was less than 3%, and the benchmark interest rate was set at virtually zero from 2020 until early 2022."", ""So, even if the Fed's rate cuts proceed as expected, the benchmark rate will still be higher than it was at any point since the mid-2000s prior to the current cycle."", ""First, the interest rates paid by banks on deposits don't have a direct relationship with the Fed's benchmark interest rates. However, since the federal funds rate impacts how much it costs banks to borrow money, the rates do tend to move in the same direction."", ""With high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts, the relationship is usually more direct. Unlike CDs, there isn't a time component with these, meaning that the interest rates can change at any time. In short, their rates are based on the current interest rate environment."", ""For CDs, it's a little more complicated. The simple explanation is that the longer a CD's maturity term, the more its rate will be driven by future expectations for the interest rate environment."", ""This is why 1-year CDs generally pay more than 5-year CDs right now, despite the opposite being the case traditionally. The expectation is that over the next few years, rates will continue to fall, so that's affecting the rates banks are willing to pay for longer-term products."", ""Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict future interest rates, and I'm certainly not an exception. But my general expectation is that if the Fed's rate cuts proceed as expected (and that's a big if), the shortest-term CD rates -- say CDs with terms of one year or less -- will generally follow suit. In other words, if a bank offers a 4.5% rate on a 1-year CD today, I'd expect something close to 3% at the end of 2025."", ""I'd expect far less movement from longer-term CDs.

Here’s a look at how CD rates are trending, along with an overview of the best rates for several different terms.', 'Related: Compare the Best CD Rates', 'A CD is a savings account with a fixed interest rate and a maturity period, which is what makes them time deposit accounts. When you open a CD, you agree to lock up your deposit without touching it until the CD’s term is up, whether that’s in six months or five years. Your patience is rewarded with interest that’s usually better than what you’d earn from a regular savings account.', 'Withdraw money from a CD before “maturity”—when it reaches the end of its term—and you can be slapped with stiff penalties. For example, you can lose up to six months’ worth of interest if you make an early withdrawal from a one-year CD.', 'The longer the term, the harsher the early withdrawal penalty. It’s not unusual to lose one full year’s worth of interest or more if you break open a five-year CD too soon. Be absolutely certain you understand the penalty before you make your investment.', 'For short-term savings goals, three-month CDs might make sense. The current average rate on a three-month CD sits at 1.33%, but the highest rate is 5.30%. Last week, three-month CDs were earning 1.32% on average.', 'If you’re interested in a shorter-term CD, today’s best six-month CD rate is 5.25%. That compares with 5.25% a week ago. The current average APY for a six-month CD is 1.86%, steady with last week at this time.', 'APY provides a more accurate calculation of the yearly interest you’ll earn with a CD because it takes into account compound interest. That’s the interest you earn not only on your deposit (or principal) but also on the interest in the account.', 'The highest interest rate currently being offered on a 12-month CD—one of the most popular CD terms—is 5.37%. If you discover a one-year CD with a rate in that neighborhood, you’ve found a good deal. One week ago, the best rate was the same.', 'The average APY, or annual percentage yield, on a one-year CD is now 1.87%, the same as a week ago.', 'If you can hold out for two years, 24-month CDs today are being offered at interest rates as high as 4.76%. The top rate last week at this time was a similar 4.76%. Two-year CDs now have an average APY of 1.64%. That’s the same as last week at this time.', 'CDs with longer terms often have some of the most attractive interest rates and APYs—if you’re willing to keep your money locked up for years.', 'Within the last week, the highest rate on a three-year CD has been 4.65%, so you’ll want to shop around for that rate or something near it.', 'On a five-year CD, the highest rate today is 4.46%. APYs are averaging 1.57%, the same as this time last week.', 'The longer the term, the harsher the early withdrawal penalty. It’s not unusual to lose one full year’s worth of interest or more if you break open a five-year CD too soon. Be absolutely certain you understand the penalty before you make your investment.', 'The best rate on today’s jumbo CDs is 5.25% for a 6-month term. The average APY for this category of CD is currently 1.90%, compared to 1.80% last week.', 'Most jumbo CDs require a minimum deposit of $100,000—and some even require $250,000. However, there’s no universally agreed-upon definition regarding what qualifies as a “jumbo” CD. Some banks and credit unions slap the label “jumbo” on CDs you can open with $50,000, $25,000 or even less.', 'Related: CD Interest Rates Forecast: How Good Will They Get?', 'Want to earn higher yield, but wary of keeping your money chained up for years? A CD ladder can help you earn good returns and make your investment feel more liquid.', 'You build a ladder by investing your money in multiple CDs with terms of different lengths. You might buy a one-year CD, a two-year CD, a three-year CD, a four-year CD and a five-year CD. As each of the shorter-term CDs matures, you replace it with a new five-year CD.', 'Follow this course, and in a few years you’ll have one better-yielding five-year CD maturing each year. If you’re ever having a bad year, you could take some of the cash from the expiring CD and use it to pay bills instead of pouring it all into a fresh CD.', 'You’ve got to comparison shop to track down the best CD rates. Banks and credit unions compete by offering alluring yields to land your business, so shopping around is a must before you purchase any bank CD or credit union share certificate.', 'There are no one-time or recurring costs associated with CDs, but you may pay a penalty fee in the form of reduced interest if you withdraw from your CD before it matures. You are required to deposit a minimum amount of cash when you open a CD, but get all of that money back—plus interest—at the end of the CD’s term.', 'Curinos determines the average rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) by focusing on specific CDs and excluding others. Certain types, such as promotional offers, relationship-based rates, private, youth, senior, student/minor, affinity, bump-up, no-penalty, callable, variable, step-up, auto transfer, club, gifts, grandfathered, internet-only and IRA CDs are not considered in the calculation.', '', '', ""With more than 15 years of experience crafting content about all aspects of personal finance, Michael Benninger knows how to identify smart moves for your money.

You still need savings -- they are part of your financial foundations. But once you've got that basis, you can afford to take slightly more risk in exchange for higher returns. And over time, compound interest (earning interest on your interest) can prove transformative."", ""Many people get nervous at the idea of investing. There's a perception you need to read the business pages every morning and be able to analyze charts and profit sheets to buy shares. That's one way to invest, but it's not the only way. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are much more accessible. "", ""ETFs are essentially baskets of securities that you can buy and sell like ordinary stocks. They can be a great way for beginner investors to build a diversified portfolio. You'll still need to do some research to know which ones to buy, but they are great buy-and-hold investments. "", 'Want to buy ETFs?

After 30 years, you'd have invested a total of $72,000. But your portfolio could be worth over $270,000."", ""Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are another type of investment. The trust is a company that owns and manages a mix of real estate assets. That might be office buildings, apartments, shopping malls, hotels, or something else. It's a way to diversify your portfolio by holding real estate, without actually buying property."", 'One of the great things about REITs is that they have to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders each year. This can translate into great dividend payments for investors. And that can be an excellent source of passive income. Dividend payments come on top of any appreciation in value of the trust itself. ', 'According to NAREIT, the average dividend payment from REITs was 3.9% last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 generated 1.7% in dividends. As falling rates start to impact savings and CDs, investments that pay dividends can be a good source of passive income.

"", ""If you don't plan to touch your money for five to 10 years or more, look for ways to invest it. That might be through ETFs, REITs, or another investment vehicle.

As inflation spiked and interest rates surged to their highest level in decades, rates on high-yield savings and certificates of deposit (CD) accounts soared alongside it, rising exponentially from where they were in 2020 and 2021. As a result, savers could easily earn rates of 4% to 5% or higher, depending on the account and lender in use."", ""One of the smart ways to earn these high rates is with a CD, in particular.

""An investor who is constantly having to reinvest because they decided to use one-month CDs might find that after 12 months, they\'re collecting less yield than if they had locked in a 12-month CD in the first place.""', 'Of course, it\'s also worth considering what else is currently in your portfolio, as DeLarme believes it\'s important to ""diversify among different maturities and avoid simply going to where the yield is.""

And, while they provide less certainty than CDs, the added flexibility they offer can sometimes be important.

What if your ideal home becomes available in nine months, and you can\'t access your savings for the down payment?""', 'Michalka also warns against putting your emergency fund into a long-term CD, as the money would be inaccessible if an unexpected expense came up.

', 'Finally, buying U.S. Treasuries is another alternative worth considering, as Gammon explains they are a ""safe investment, which are backed by the U.S. government and quite similar to CDs.""', ""U.S. treasuries, which include bills, notes and bonds, are loans you make to the U.S. government that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. They're low-risk investments that provide fixed-interest payments as well as another big advantage that CDs don't offer. "", '""Treasuries are exempt from state and local taxes, allowing you to keep more interest after tax compared to a CD or savings account,"" Michalka says. ', ""You can also buy and sell treasuries on the secondary market, which means there's more flexibility than with CDs. However, it's important to compare treasury vs. CD yields, as sometimes CDs offer a more competitive return on investment than treasuries offer.
