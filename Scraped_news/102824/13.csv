At least four officers of the Iranian army, serving in missile-defense units, were killed. Nevertheless, Iran is relieved that its worst fears didn’t come true. A day before the attacks, Israel had used intermediaries to warn Iran about them, to make sure they wouldn’t cause massive casualties, Mostafa Najafi, a security expert in Tehran with connections to the regime’s elites, told me. He said the attacks weren’t “as vast and painful as Israeli officials had claimed” they would be. Israel did not target Iran’s infrastructure, such as its oil and gas refineries, nor did it assassinate political or military leaders.', 'Because of this, Iran has an opportunity to call it quits by giving a weak enough response that wouldn’t invite Israeli retaliation.

It was big enough to impose some costs, and I think to have some deterrent to impact on Iran's calculus.

As you noted, two of Iran's neighboring states use permitted the Israelis to use their airspace to undertake these attacks. It demonstrates how vulnerable Iran is because of the alignment of many of the rest countries in the rest of the region with Israel."", 'But of course, there are condemnations for many, many regional states as well, including Saudi Arabia, which I think speaks to the fact that no country in the region really wants to see this situation escalate further than it has.', 'John Yang:', ""There's been so for many years, Israel and Iran sort of fighting by proxy, Iranian sponsored groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis attacking Israel. Have we reached a new phase now where these two countries, these two long time enemies, are going to be attacking each other directly?"", 'Suzanne Maloney:', ""Yes, I think that's exactly where we were. As you noted, for about the past decade, there's been a gray zone war between Iran and Israel, often involving proxies or war in third countries such as Syria. What we've seen since April is a willingness on the part of the Iranians to strike directly in an attributable fashion against Israel, and by Israel to respond directly with attacks on Iran — on the Iranian homeland."", 'I think this is in much more dangerous phase of the war, although the actions of the past 24 hours may create some pause on the part of the Iranians to take the next step of escalation.', 'John Yang:', 'Much more dangerous phase. Does this you think take us? Are we step closer? Are we closer to having a broader war in the Middle East?', 'Suzanne Maloney:', ""We are absolutely on the precipice of a broader war, and the only thing that will really ensure that we don't get there is to see a ceasefire in Gaza, a reduction of tensions around the region, and a commitment on the part of Iran and other countries to stop trying to fuel the fire and trying to press their aggression against Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack severely damaged Tehran’s defenses, without providing further details.', '• Meanwhile, Gaza hostage and ceasefire negotiations have resumed, the first high-level talks in two months. Egypt, which helps mediate between Hamas and Israel, is proposing an initial two-day ceasefire and exchange.', '• At least 30 medical staff members were detained during Israeli raids at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, according to the enclave’s health ministry. The head of the World Health Organization called attacks on health care “deplorable,” and said Israel’s military has created “catastrophic” conditions in the north of the strip.', '• In Israel, first responders said at least one person was killed and more than 30 injured after a truck rammed a bus near a military base north of Tel Aviv, in what Israeli authorities said was a deliberate attack.', 'The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says the “entire population of north Gaza is at risk of dying,” as Israel continues intense military operations in the area.', '“Hundreds of Palestinians have reportedly been killed. Tens of thousands have been forced to flee yet again,” acting Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Joyce Msuya said in a statement. “Hospitals have been hit and health workers have been detained. Shelters have been emptied and burned down. First responders have been prevented from saving people from under the rubble. Families have been separated and men and boys are being taken away by the truckload.”', 'Msuya went on to say that “what Israeli forces are doing in besieged north Gaza cannot be allowed to continue.”', '“Such blatant disregard for basic humanity and for the laws of war must stop,” she added.', 'Iraq has accused the Israeli military of violating its airspace when it carried out a series of strikes on Iran on Saturday.', 'In a statement Monday, an Iraqi government spokesperson said Iraq had sent a letter of protest to the United Nations to condemn the alleged Israeli breach.', '“The Iraqi government reaffirms its steadfast commitment to Iraq’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. It will not allow Iraqi airspace or land to be used for attacks on other nations, particularly neighboring countries with whom Iraq shares mutual respect and interests,” spokesperson Basim Alawdi said in the statement.', '', 'Israel said on Saturday it had struck military targets inside Iran in response to earlier Iranian attacks, again raising fears that the long-running confrontation between the two powerful militaries could escalate into an all-out regional war. Asked if it had used Iraqi airspace, the Israeli military said it can’t elaborate beyond what was already published.', 'Iran earlier claimed Israel had used Iraqi airspace to carry out the attacks and accused the US of complicity. The US has said it was notified about the strikes but was not directly involved.', 'According to the Iraqi statement, Iraq’s prime minister has told the country’s foreign ministry to raise the alleged Israeli violation with US officials.', 'Foreign ministers of seven countries have called on Israel to halt legislation that would prevent the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees from working in Israel – a move that would potentially impact the lives of millions.', 'The bill, due to be brought to the Israeli parliament this week for a vote, would prohibit any Israeli official from providing services or dealing with employees of UNRWA and forbid the agency from operating in Israel.

Video from the scene showed victims being placed in pick-up trucks, including at least two children, and several people who appeared to be dead on the ground. Israel’s military claimed it targeted Hamas operatives in the strike.', 'At least 30 medical staff were detained by Israeli forces at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health. The director of the hospital told CNN the situation at the medical center was dire, with resources dwindling and now even fewer people to care for patients. The director’s 21-year-old son was killed by Israeli shelling at the hospital, he said.', '• Nearby, about 40 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on residential buildings in Beit Lahiya late Saturday, health officials said. Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, the spokesperson for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said Sunday that in addition to those killed, more than 80 people had been wounded in the strikes on a residential area in the city.', '• The head of the World Health Organization called attacks on health care in Gaza “deplorable” and the conditions in northern Gaza “catastrophic.” The “devastation and deprivation” caused by Israel’s military in the north of the enclave is “making the conditions of life untenable” for Palestinians there, the spokesperson for the United Nations’ Secretary-General António Guterres said.', 'In Israel:', '• Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel’s strikes on Iran had severely damaged Tehran’s defense capabilities, without providing further details on what was targeted. Iran said Israel attacked military facilities across the country Saturday morning, killing one civilian in addition to four army personnel, and causing “limited damage.”', '• Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said that Hezbollah and Hamas are no longer “effective” proxies for Iran after Israeli operations killed several leading figures from the two groups in recent weeks.', '• More than 30 people were injured and one was killed when a truck rammed a bus near a military base in central Israel on Sunday, according to Israeli emergency services.', 'Ceasefire talks:', '• Elsewhere, talks aimed at restarting hostage and ceasefire negotiations for Gaza resumed Sunday, the first high-level talks in two months. Egypt, which helps mediate between Hamas and Israel, is proposing an initial two-day ceasefire and exchange.', 'Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks in Doha “have begun,” a diplomat familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday.', 'Top negotiators from the United States, Israel and Qatar were slated to meet in Doha on Sunday to discuss efforts to reach an agreement, CNN reported on Thursday.', 'This is the first round of high-level talks in more than two months. US officials have argued for renewed momentum following Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.', 'Earlier Sunday, Egypt publicly proposed a two-day ceasefire deal in which four Israeli hostages in Gaza would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Cairo has played a key role in mediating the talks, along with Qatar and the US.', 'An Israeli strike killed several people at the Asmaa school west of Gaza City on Sunday, according to Gaza’s Civil Defense.', 'Video from the scene showed victims being placed in pick-up trucks, including at least two children, and several people who appear to be dead on the ground.', 'The Hamas-run Government Media Office later said three of the dead worked for Hamas-affiliated media outlets.', 'The Civil Defense said crews were able to retrieve a number of bodies and wounded people, and that rescuers were still searching for missing people under the rubble.', 'The school compound in Al-Shati refugee camp, where hundreds of displaced people are staying, has been struck several times during the war.', 'Israel’s military claimed it targeted Hamas operatives in the strike. It alleged that a Hamas command and control center was embedded in the compound and said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.', '“The strike was directed toward a number of terrorists who were operating in the compound, including a terrorist cell commander and three additional terrorists in Hamas’ Military Wing,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.', '', 'After a previous strike targeting what it said were Hamas operatives in the compound, the IDF had said Hamas “systematically, intentionally and strategically places its infrastructure and operates from within civilian areas.”', 'Remember: Renewed Israeli military operations in northern Gaza have once again displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, and left many others dead from bombardment. Authorities in Gaza say the Israeli military has stopped aid from reaching parts of the area.', 'The United Nations’ human rights chief has warned the war’s “darkest moment” is unfolding in the north of the enclave.', 'Iran vowed Sunday to respond to Israel’s strikes on the country this weekend, which Tehran says killed five people, but said it does not want a wider war.', '“We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of the people and the nation, and we will give an appropriate response to the Zionist entity’s aggression,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency.', '', 'The Iranian president warned tensions would escalate if Israel “continues its aggression and crimes” and accused the United States of “provoking the regime into committing these crimes.”', 'IRNA also quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi as saying Iran was not seeking war, but adding that it would respond to any aggression by Israel at an “appropriate time.”', 'Remember: Israel has said its strikes on Iran early Saturday local time hit military targets and were in response to Iranian attacks on Israel earlier this month.', 'What Israel is saying: Israel’s chief of the general staff, Herzi Halevi, warned on Sunday that any threat against his country would be dealt with militarily. He added that Israel had “used only a portion” of its military capabilities during Saturday’s strikes on Iran.', '“We will now see how things develop. We are prepared for all scenarios in every arena,” he said.', 'Keep in mind: Israel had a relatively muted public posture immediately after the strikes, which was intentional, according to a source familiar with the government’s thinking, aimed at giving Iran the opportunity to downplay the strikes and avoid further escalation.', 'Iran’s government seemed to seize that opportunity initially, claiming the strikes caused only limited damage at military sites, even as it acknowledged that one civilian and four Iranian soldiers were killed.', 'The “devastation and deprivation” caused by Israel’s military operations in northern Gaza is “making the conditions of life untenable” for Palestinians there, the spokesperson for the United Nations’ Secretary-General António Guterres said Sunday.', '“The plight of Palestinian civilians trapped in north Gaza is unbearable,” Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement.', '', 'Israel has been bombarding northern Gaza for weeks, after saying it received intelligence that Hamas is rebuilding in the area.', '“The Secretary-General is shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction in the north, with civilians trapped under rubble, the sick and wounded going without life-saving health care, and families lacking food and shelter, amid reports of families being separated and many people detained,” he continued.', '', 'Israeli authorities are continuing to deny attempts to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need, Dujarric said, “with few exceptions, putting countless lives in peril.”', 'A report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released Tuesday claimed that, in the first three weeks of October, only four out of 70 planned aid movements into Gaza were facilitated by Israeli authorities.', 'A UN-led campaign to vaccinate children in Gaza against polio has also been postponed in the north of the Strip, Dujarric said, “putting the lives of thousands of children at risk.”', '“This conflict continues to be waged with little regard for the requirements of international humanitarian law,” the spokesperson continued.', 'An Israeli MP behind a bill that would prevent the main UN agency in Gaza and the West Bank from working in Israel has accused the US ambassador in Israel of lobbying opposition leaders to block the move.', 'If the bill passes in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, this week, it will prohibit any Israeli official from providing services or dealing with employees of the UN Relief and Works Agency and forbid UNRWA from operating in Israel.', 'Several countries, including the US, have expressed concern over the impact of the bill.', 'The Israeli government has claimed that some of the UN Relief and Works Agency’s (UNRWA) staff are affiliated with Hamas.

Iran readying for war with Israel as it braces for response to missile attack — NYT,https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-readying-for-war-with-israel-as-it-braces-for-response-to-missile-attack-nyt/,"['ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 388', 'Iran is readying for war with Israel while at the same time seeking to avoid one, according to a Thursday report, and its next steps will be determined by Israel’s response to Tehran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack, the outline of which was said to have been approved in recent days.', 'Citing four Iranian officials, The New York Times reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered Iran’s armed forces to formulate numerous plans based on the potential outcome of an expected retaliatory attack by Israel, which has been weeks in the making. “Iran has ordered the armed forces to be prepared for war but also to try to avoid it,” the report said.', 'The officials, two of whom belong to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that if Israel were to inflict significant damage on sensitive sites, such as oil and nuclear facilities, or if it were to target senior Iranian officials, Iran would without a doubt escalate further.', 'In this instance, the sources said, Iran could fire a barrage of up to 1,000 ballistic missiles — a significant step up in comparison to the 200 it fired on October 1 — or even disrupt global energy supplies and international trade routes.', 'However, if Jerusalem were to limit its response to striking weapons warehouses or military bases, Tehran may conclude that it is in its best interest to do nothing, bringing an end to the latest round of direct conflict between the two countries.', 'Israel had previously been thought to be mulling attacks on Iranian oil infrastructure or nuclear sites, both opposed by the US for their potential to escalate fighting, including Iranian reprisals aimed at civilian infrastructure in Israel or other regional countries aligned with the West.', 'Iranian leaders publicly maintain that they are not seeking to descend into an all-out regional war, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi went on an intensive regional tour last week to stress that point. However, they also fear looking weak, the report said, and a heavy blow at the hands of Israel could leave them vulnerable and feeling as though they must reassert dominance in the region.', 'Iran’s efforts to appear strong even amid the heavy blows dealt to its proxies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza were apparent in the threats it issued against Israel and its allies, even as Araghchi tried to reassure the world that escalation was the last thing Tehran wanted.', 'IRGC chief Hossein Salami warned on Thursday that even with the assistance of an advanced US missile defense system recently stationed in Israel, it wouldn’t be able to ward off future attacks from Tehran.', '“Just as the Arrow anti-missile systems did not work during Operation True Promise 2, the THAAD systems will not work either.
