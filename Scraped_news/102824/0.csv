While visiting with survivors, the former president at one point threw paper towels into the crowd when distributing supplies, a move that was criticized as callous amid widespread frustration over the federal response to the hurricane that left much of the island without power and food.

Prior to that, she also took aim at the Republican candidate in a video message to Puerto Rican voters, eventually praised by Latin superstar Bad Bunny.
