In fact, with second-gen Oryon CPU tech on a more efficient 3nm process, it’s actually better than the 4nm X Elite in some regards. ', 'The chipset is comprised of two 4.32GHz Prime Cores, the fastest in the mobile chipset market right now, along with six 3.35GHz Performance Cores, with no Efficiency Cores this time around. ', 'There’s also a new Adreno GPU with a split architecture for the first time, not only boosting gameplay capabilities but power efficiency by up to a whopping 40% compared to the 8 Gen 3, which should translate to better gaming experiences that last longer on a single charge.

Has Qualcomm finally secured its vice-like grip on Android flagships?,https://www.androidauthority.com/what-now-for-snapdragon-rivals-3492460/,"['Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.', 'October 26, 2024', 'If early benchmarks are to be believed, Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite is a serious workhorse that easily outpaces current Android and even Apple smartphones. Obviously, this will cause other silicon developers to be concerned. It’s rumored that Samsung is rushing to secure more chips for Galaxy S25, for instance, possibly because it wants to guarantee the absolute best performance for all its next-generation flagships.', 'While we’re still waiting to see if the 8 Elite performs as well as promised in upcoming consumer handsets, even a few percentage points dropped will still leave next-gen Snapdragon-powered phones well ahead of most competitors. This could cause quite an industry shakeup.', 'For a number of years now, the Android chipset market has mostly been a case of Snapdragon and “the rest.” It’s not that rival players like MediaTek and Samsung have produced massively inferior chips; performance and feature comparisons have often been relatively close, and Qualcomm hasn’t always been first with new industry features. However, partnerships and sales volume, and to some degree public perception as well, have leaned heavily in Qualcomm’s favor for most of the past decade. It’s hard to name many recent flagship smartphones that are not powered by Snapdragon.', 'Reports that Samsung is once again looking for enough chips to power its Galaxy S series exclusively with the Snapdragon 8 Elite highlight two key issues. First, Samsung Foundry’s manufacturing yields are once again rumored to be in trouble, resulting in far too few suitable chips from its cutting-edge manufacturing process. We first saw signs of issues with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, which was manufactured on Samsung Foundry’s 4nm node. The chip suffered from high temperature and performance throttling issues that were seemingly remedied by moving to TSMC’s rival node for the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1. Samsung’s own 4nm Exynos 2200 received an even more mixed reception.', 'The following year, Samsung’s Galaxy S23 series went Snapdragon-only for the first time. While this was disguised as a strategic partnership, the return to a mixed chipset strategy with the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus all but confirms that Samsung’s Exynos 2300 either wasn’t competitive enough or that Samsung Foundry was still suffering yield issues.', 'Cutting-edge silicon manufacturing is only becoming more difficult and more expensive. The Exynos 2500 should be Samsung’s showcase for its latest manufacturing process. If it fails to materialize in the S25 series, rival TSMC will have the only commercial 3nm mobile chips on the market, and a monopoly on manufacturing is not good news for capacity or prices. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is already reported to be much more expensive than its predecessor.', 'We don’t know if manufacturing is the reason behind Exynos’ reported disappearing act. It’s not certain that the chip is a goner either; it might be destined for another Galaxy FE handset or tablet, for instance. Still, that suggests that if Samsung can build the chips, they’re not necessarily close to being competitive with Snapdragon on key performance metrics anymore, and that’s the second problem.', 'While classic performance metrics certainly aren’t everything these days, Samsung’s dual-chip approach makes it acutely vulnerable to performance differences between Arm Cortex CPU components and Qualcomm’s custom CPU developments. Obviously, other players are affected, too. MediaTek’s Dimensity has pushed the boat on elaborate big-core CPU setups to mark itself out as a performance leader, and it has scored some recent wins in China, such as the vivo X200 and X200 Pro. However, their Ultra counterpart still opts for Snapdragon. Even so, with the 8 Elite throwing in massive 40% gains, it’ll almost certainly catch the eye of every manufacturer looking to sell peak performance in late 2024/2025.', 'This leaves rivals like MediaTek and Samsung in an awkward position. Do they continue relying on Arm’s Cortex program to deliver relatively hassle-free CPU development and hope that the next generation or two catches up, or do they also pursue the more risky custom CPU route in a bid to close the gap with Qualcomm? All the big players have likely long been assessing the potential for custom cores, but development is expensive, time-consuming, and has no guarantee of success. Samsung had dubious results with its custom Mongoose core, after all. Qualcomm gave itself a major headstart when it paid $1.4 billion for Nuvia in 2021, netting it the building blocks for its custom CPU developments now found in Snapdragon X and the 8 Elite.', 'Even if we see more custom CPUs on the market in the coming years, this still doesn’t address the graphics or custom AI silicon discrepancies. Of course, Qualcomm could be beaten on price, but its rivals haven’t scored breakout success with that strategy so far, and there are no marketing wins to be scored by settling for second place anyway.', 'Perhaps in just as much trouble as Samsung’s Exynos program is Google’s Pixel. As we know all too well, Google’s Tensor processor already lags behind the competition in every metric except AI. Benchmarks suggest the 8 Elite could double the performance of Google’s current flagship Pixel 9 series in CPU and GPU performance, leaving them looking positively dated already, especially for mobile gamers. The Tensor G5 is not exactly shaping up to be a particularly ambitious chip either, though it will be a bigger jump than the Tensor G4. Google’s pace of progress is slow, to put it bluntly, and it’s only just looking to shake off the heavy design assistance provided by Samsung’s semiconductor division.', 'Already, the picture is shaping up; buy Snapdragon if you want maximum performance, and stick with Tensor if you want first access to Google’s AI tools. But how long can a brand rely on small elements of bespoke software to plug what is clearly an increasingly wide gulf between its flagship chips and the rest of the Android ecosystem? I’d wager not too long. Enthusiasts — the quintessential Pixel consumer — will be keenly eyeballing the hardware on the other side of the fence.', 'While Google’s more isolated and internal development has shielded it from what I’m dubbing “the Snapdragon effect,” it’s banking on AI tools as a consistent differentiating factor. However, it’s far from clear that consumers are all that interested in this tech buzzword. Internally, Google will be accurately aware of the performance discrepancy and is likely planning a contingency. According to documents seen by Android Authority, Google is working on a custom CPU core called Orion that could debut with the Tensor G6 or, more likely, later chipsets. Whether this will be hyper-competitive with what Qualcomm and others are manufacturing by 2026/2027 is anyone’s guess. Maybe Google will eventually return to Snapdragon if the pressure becomes too great.', 'All this said, I certainly don’t want to oversell the Snapdragon 8 Elite. We haven’t laid hands on consumer handsets yet, and price and power efficiency will be just as important as the chip’s performance potential. Get either of those badly wrong and we’ll be having a very different discussion about Qualcomm’s CPU choices in a few week’s time.', 'That said, the currently broad market for Android mobile processors has been kept in its delicate balance by two key factors that are undeniably under threat — relatively small performance differences between chips and a choice of competitive manufacturing partners. Unless the industry takes a collective step back and realizes that, just perhaps, peak performance isn’t all that important to modern smartphones anymore, it’s looking increasingly likely that Snapdragon’s already tight grip on the flagship market might finally kill off a few of the lingering alternatives.

In an effort to expand its business, the company in 2021 hired a group of ex-Apple engineers to help it design laptop chips, which went on sale this year and are helping power artificial intelligence (AI) features in Microsoft's Windows."", 'Brief history of Qualcomm', 'Qualcomm is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. It owns patents critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA mobile communications standards.', 'Qualcomm was established in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs and six other co-founders. Its early research into CDMA wireless cell phone technology was funded by selling a two-way mobile digital satellite communications system known as Omnitracs.', ""After a heated debate in the wireless industry, CDMA was adopted as a 2G standard in North America with Qualcomm's patents incorporated. Afterwards, there was a series of legal disputes about pricing for licensing patents required by the standard."", 'Over the years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model. It also developed semiconductor components or software for vehicles, watches, laptops, wi-fi, smartphones, and other devices.', 'Impact of the new technology developed', 'The Reuters report further detailed that, now, the technology developed by that team - a set of custom computing technology Qualcomm has branded ""Oryon"" - is being put into the company\'s mobile phone chips for the first time.', ""The company has also reworked the parts of the chip, which is called the Snapdragon 8 Elite, to handle tasks such as generating images and text. Qualcomm will offer software developers special tools beyond the ones already available in Alphabet's Android operating system to tap into those parts of the chip."", '""AI has been one of those where I think Google is moving fast, but we have our own technology to offer that end developer,"" Chris Patrick, Qualcomm\'s senior vice president and general manager for mobile handsets, discussed with Reuters.

Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon 8 Elite with custom cores for Android phones,https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/22/qualcomm_snapdragon_8_elite/,"[""During day one of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, it unveiled its latest flagship SoC, dubbed the Snapdragon 8 Elite. This marks a pivotal swing into harnessing the technical prowess of its acquired Nuvia team."", ""The new chip is powered by Qualcomm's in-house Oryon cores and moves away from its reliance on Arm's off-the-shelf Cortex cores to drive its flagship mobile SoC. The chipmaker, however, hasn't strayed too far, as the Oryon cores are still based on Arm's v8.7-A ISA, but it's certainly a step away from previous generations, as Qualcomm is aiming to do things on its own terms."", ""Featured in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the new Oryon cores replace the Kryo cores that Qualcomm has long relied on. The outfit claims this new Elite SoC delivers a 44 percent improvement in power efficiency over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, though as always with these numbers, it's worth waiting until real-world benchmarks come in before taking that as gospel."", ""For manufacturing, Qualcomm is using TSMC's 3nm N3E node, which is actually the same process used by rivals including Apple for its A18 chips and MediaTek with its Dimensity 9400."", 'The Snapdragon maker has also gone a different route on the design too, as it has decided to ditch the familiar mix of prime, performance, and efficiency cores and has opted to eliminate smaller cores altogether. The Snapdragon 8 Elite has two prime cores clocked at 4.32 GHz and six performance cores at 3.53 GHz.', 'It wouldn\'t be a new chip without AI being crammed in, and Qualcomm has indeed embedded the Snapdragon 8 Elite with its Hexagon NPU. The chip maker claims it is 60 percent better in terms of ""AI performance"" than the previous generation, but that remains to be seen in real world applications.', 'Graphics have also uplifted over the last generation with the latest Adreno 750 GPU. Qualcomm has thrown in hardware-accelerated ray tracing and support for 144 Hz at 4K, and it does claim a marked 25 percent improvement over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but as usual, those figures are just marketing until the benchmarks prove otherwise.', ""Being limited to 4K 60fps in recording is a slight caveat, as the MediaTek Dimensity 9400 is offering 8K 60fps. Touching on image quality, the chip giant's Spectra ISP has been rebranded as the AI ISP for the Snapdragon 8 Elite, increasing throughput to 4.3 gigapixels per second from 3.2 gigapixels. It also supports configurations like 48MP + 48MP + 48MP multi-sensor and 108MP single camera at 30FPS. Qualcomm has bumped up the still image support to 320MP, compared to 200MP in the previous Snapdragon 8 Gen 3."", ""Other features of the Snapdragon 8 Elite include Qualcomm's aptX Lossless technology, which is claimed to deliver up to 24-bit 48 kHz Bluetooth audio streaming and 96kHz over Wi-Fi. It also has its fabled XPAN technology for wide-range audio coverage via low-power Wi-Fi 7. On the connectivity side, the Snapdragon X80 5G modem supports multi-gigabit speeds with 4x6 MIMO, while FastConnect 7900 system integrates Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and UWB proximity that enables features such as object tracking and building access control."", 'Leo Gebbie, principal analyst and director at CCS Insight, stated how the Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm\'s strongest chipset launch yet and is pushing AI to the forefront of its platforms. ""The Snapdragon 8 Elite provides the basis to accelerate the introduction of AI features into third-party apps and integrated multi-modal assistants,"" he noted.', 'Gebbie also emphasized the backing from key device makers like Honor, Samsung, and Xiaomi, which means Qualcomm is set to maintain its presence in the premium Android segment. ""Early backing from device makers including Honor, Samsung and Xiaomi is a strong start for Qualcomm as it looks to continue its dominance at the premium end of the Android smartphone market.""', ""A few devices have already been announced that are set to put the Snapdragon 8 Elite into the hands of consumers, including the Xiaomi 15 series, OnePlus 13, iQOO 13, and the Honor Magic 7. These are expected to start plodding onto shelves sometime in October. It's likely we'll see more brands such as Vivo and Oppo come with even more Snapdragon 8 Elite devices, but the proof in all the pudding will be the real-world performance and how it stacks up against Apple and MediaTek's product sets. ®"", 'Send us news', 'The Register Biting the hand that feeds IT', 'Copyright.

Believe the hype: Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite will change everything about smartphones,https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/believe-the-hype-qualcomms-snapdragon-8-elite-will-change-everything-about-smartphones,"['True laptop power in a smartphone', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'Can you get excited about a microchip? If you’ve never chosen your phone based on the chip inside, that may be worth considering when Snapdragon 8 Elite phones start to arrive. Qualcomm is doing for the next generation of smartphones what it recently did for Windows laptops, and phones that realize its vision will be different from anything we’ve seen before.', 'Last year, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon X Elite chipset, a powerful processor that uses the sort of low-power cores normally found in smartphones. The obvious benefit is incredible battery life, since mobile processors are made to sip juice, not gulp. That benefit is now coming to smartphones, and I’m expecting great battery life gains in the next generation. All-day battery life is going to be the rule, not a rarity.', 'With the Snapdragon X Elite, Qualcomm created an incredibly powerful new chipset that includes its Oryon processing core. The X Elite is truly supercharged. The result was the fastest Windows laptops you could buy, and the first Windows laptops in years that could outperform a premium MacBook Pro.', '', 'This year, Qualcomm flew TechRadar to Maui for its Snapdragon Summit, and to check out the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which brings that Oryon core to smartphones. After all the speeches and bluster, I got to actually put the chips to work. Qualcomm provided a reference sample phone for benchmark comparisons – and the results completely blew me away.', 'I don’t let benchmark scores influence my reviews – I rely on my real-world testing and experience – but benchmarks can be handy for quick comparison. Take these results with a dash of salt, but the difference between the Snapdragon 8 Elite and all of the other phones I’ve tested is dramatic.', 'I tested the new Snapdragon 8 Elite alongside a Galaxy S24 Ultra, an iPhone 16 Pro, and even a Google Pixel 9 Pro (for laughs, the Pixel is terrible at benchmarks). Of course the new Snapdragon beat the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Galaxy, but could it beat the iPhone? The results weren’t even close.', 'Running the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme test, the iPhone scored 4,086 while the Snapdragon turned in a whopping 7,019. On the GFX Manhattan 3.1 test, the iPhone drew 3,647 frames, while the Snapdragon produced 7,452 frames, more than twice as many. Again, these are only benchmarks, but those differences are stark.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', '', 'What’s much more interesting is how the Snapdragon 8 Elite compares to laptop chips. Compared to an Intel Core Ultra 7, the Snapdragon 8 Elite beat Intel’s laptop chip in Geekbench on single-core performance, and came very close on multi-core testing.', 'Qualcomm may have created a mobile chipset that performs as well as a PC. I can’t be sure until I’ve used a final, production handset with a Snapdragon 8 Elite inside, like the Asus ROG Phone 9; but for the first time ever, we may see comparable power from the best phones and best laptops.', 'App developers are bringing mobile apps closer in function to their desktop counterparts, but we may soon get identical versions of Adobe Lightroom or Microsoft Excel across Android and Windows, not to mention all the games we could finally play on a phone.', 'I’m very excited about what this means for a concept like Samsung’s DeX. With DeX, I plug my phone into a monitor and keyboard and I can use it like a desktop. If the next Galaxy S25 Ultra has a Snapdragon 8 Elite inside, DeX won’t just be a convenient way to write long emails and play mobile games on a big screen. With real PC power, my phone could replace the Surface Go laptop I use for work.', 'The problem is that power is expensive. Qualcomm is driving hard to beat the competition with this latest chip, both in terms of processing performance as well as power management. Manufacturing the Snapdragon 8 Elite will be more expensive than producing previous chips, and rumors suggest it will cost a lot more than the last generation, for the phone makers that buy it.', 'If it costs Samsung or OnePlus $40 (US estimate) more per chip, I would expect that equates to a $100 / £100 / AU$200 price increase for the phone. The prices of many of the best Android phones went up this year, and that trend is likely to continue.', 'Would I pay $1,400 / £1,350 / AU$2,400 for a Galaxy S25 Ultra? Maybe, if the Ultra truly can replace a laptop computer.', '', 'I’m not sure if a phone/laptop hybrid would appeal to most folks, but I can imagine businesses deciding to buy one device instead of supplying employees with a phone and a laptop. If we see some good accessories that make it easy to use Snapdragon 8 Elite phones as a PC replacement, I think we’ll see phone makers selling devices with that purpose front and center.', 'Everything about your smartphone is going to improve when you have a chip this fast inside, from browsing the web to playing games to getting things done. Your network connection will seem faster, because the phone will be able to process the data more quickly and load pages much faster than before.', 'Honestly, we don’t even know what the future will hold when phones are this powerful, because our imagination has limited this power to big, heavy machines with gigantic batteries and a keyboard attached. I’m hoping to see entirely new categories of games, and new app concepts that will make yesterday’s phone seem primitive.

This support being available from day one is great news for game emulation. Worth noting that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is already quite good at playing PC games with Winlator and Mobox.', 'For example, as ETA Prime has demonstrated, the Galaxy S24 Ultra can play games like Fallout 4, Bioshock Remastered, and Far Cry at playable frame rates. With proper Linux support, things can be even better for the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.', ""Of course, you won't get the full performance with an emulation layer in the middle.

The renders don’t make it clear whether the accessory is the same as the cooler for the Phone 9, or if the Pro has an upgraded version.', 'Both phones appear to have the same hole-punch camera in the front, along with a three-camera setup on the back. As for specs, the ROG Phone 9 will have a 6.78-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s expected to launch with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of memory (an absolutely astronomical amount for a phone), as well as a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP telephoto lens.
