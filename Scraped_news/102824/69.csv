Geologists discover the dawn of Earth’s sixth ocean,https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/geologists-discover-the-dawn-of-earths-sixth-ocean/,"['A large crack, stretching several miles, made a sudden appearance recently in south-western Kenya. This is what Africa could look like in millions of years. (CREDIT: CC BY-SA 3.0 / Twitter)', ""In the vast, serene deserts of Ethiopia, something remarkable has been happening since 2005—a 35-mile-long crack, known as the East African Rift, has been quietly emerging. But this is more than just an interesting geological feature; it’s a phenomenon with the potential to reshape political boundaries, economic landscapes, and the geography of our planet. This rift could even lead to the creation of Earth's sixth ocean."", ""The Earth's tectonic plates—massive pieces of the Earth's crust that drift on the semi-fluid mantle beneath—are constantly in motion. These plates have played a key role in shaping our planet, responsible for the formation and breakup of supercontinents over millions of years."", 'What’s happening now in East Africa, however, is especially significant. The Somalian tectonic plate is gradually separating from the larger Nubian tectonic plate, something not seen on this scale since South America and Africa split apart hundreds of millions of years ago.', 'This shift is monumental, and its evidence comes from an in-depth study on the separation dynamics between these two tectonic plates. Published in the prestigious journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, this study reveals that the plates are slowly drifting apart, though at a pace of just a few millimeters per year.', ""So, what does this mean for Africa's future? The implications are astounding, with far-reaching effects on both the region's geology and its socio-economic landscape. For landlocked nations like Ethiopia and Uganda, this shift could mean the creation of new coastlines, turning these countries into bustling hubs of trade and commerce."", 'Related Stories', 'The potential for economic growth in these regions is immense, offering opportunities that were previously unimaginable.', 'Marine geophysicist and University of California professor emeritus, Ken Macdonald, explains the significance: ""The Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea will flood over the Afar region and into the East African Rift Valley, giving rise to a new ocean. Consequently, this part of East Africa will evolve into its own distinct continent.""', 'This isn’t just a geographic shift; it’s a transformation that will profoundly alter the region’s ecology. Areas that are now arid and desolate could one day teem with marine life as the new ocean forms. Human settlements will have to adapt to these changes, facing both challenges and opportunities as new coastlines develop.', ""However, it's important to keep in mind that this transformation won’t happen overnight. The complete separation of the African continent and the creation of a new ocean will likely take another 5 to 10 million years."", 'This timeline serves as a reminder that nature operates on a scale far beyond our lifetimes. While we may not witness the final stages of this transformation, it’s a powerful example of how dynamic our planet truly is.', ""This ongoing shift is a reminder that Earth’s surface, though it may seem solid and unchanging, is in a constant state of flux. The birth of a new ocean and the reshaping of a continent are just parts of Earth's ever-evolving story—a story that we, as inhabitants of this planet, are fortunate enough to observe and study."", 'The world’s oceans play a critical role in shaping Earth’s climate, biodiversity, and geological features. Covering about 71% of the Earth’s surface, they are divided into five major oceans: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic. Here’s an overview of each ocean along with insights into when they formed in Earth’s planetary evolution.', ""The Earth’s oceans began forming over 4 billion years ago, shortly after the planet's formation. Water vapor released from volcanic activity condensed to form the early oceans as the planet cooled. Most of the water may have originated from comet impacts and volcanic outgassing. Oceans played a crucial role in creating a stable climate and facilitating the development of early life around 3.8 billion years ago."", ""The formation of the modern oceans we know today was driven by tectonic processes over hundreds of millions of years, primarily as a result of the shifting and breakup of supercontinents like Rodinia, Pangaea, and Gondwana. These oceans continue to evolve as tectonic plates move, reshaping Earth's surface."", '', 'Note: Materials provided above by The Brighter Side of News.

You’d be mistaken to think this is a quick process as it has taken a whopping 25 million years for this crack to develop.', 'When it does eventually break away in the very distant future, a new sixth ocean will form and consequently previously landlocked countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, and Zambia will get a coastline.', ""(Left) Pangaea, and (right) the continents we're familar with today as a result of the continental driftiStockphoto by Getty Images"", 'This subject matter of the continent breaking away gained more attention when back in 2018 a huge crack (50 feet deep and 65 feet wide in some spots, local outlets reported at the time) in the Kenyan Rift Valley made headlines and its placement raised eyebrows online. Was this a result of tectonic movement or just a case of soil erosion from the heavy rain?', '“The valley has a history of tectonic and volcanic activities,” geologist David Adede told the Daily Nation at the time “Whereas the rift has remained tectonically inactive in the recent past, there could be movements deep within the Earth’s crust that have resulted in zones of weakness extending all the way to the surface.”', '“Given the evidence available at present, the best and simplest explanation is that this crack was in fact formed by erosion of soil beneath the surface due to recent heavy rains in Kenya,” Stephen Hicks, a seismology researcher at the University of Southampton wrote in The Guardian.', 'Writing in The Conversation, Lucía Pérez Díaz, at the time a postdoctoral researcher in the Fault Dynamics Research Group at the Royal Holloway University of London noted how “Questions remain as to why it has formed in the location that it did and whether its appearance is at all connected to the ongoing East African Rift.', '“For example, the crack could be the result of the erosion of soft soils infilling an old rift-related fault.”', 'If the idea of Earth’s continents once being joined together and splitting off over the course of millions of years, then you’ll be even more stunned to learn that the continents have come together and split apart (extremely slowly) at least three times over the course of Earth’s long history.', 'Mind blown.', ""How to join the indy100's free WhatsApp channel"", 'Sign up to our free indy100 weekly newsletter', 'Have your say in our news democracy.

Researchers say Africa will split into two but reassure that there's no reason to panic,https://www.good.is/researchers-say-africa-will-split-into-two-but-reassure-that-theres-no-reason-to-panic,"['The crack became visible when water gushing through it after heavy rains washed off all the lava ash that had clogged it.', '', ""Around 200 million years back, a supercontinent called Pangaea that accounted of the entire landmass on Earth, split into different continents that drifted apart with time. The movement of tectonic plates often results in cracks on Earth's landmass and is now threatening to split the second-largest contient Africa into two parts. The crack was observed in the East African Rift System (EARS), according to Live Science."", 'According to BBC Science Focus, the crack was first noticed in March 2018, when the ground tore itself apart in southwestern Kenya. Filled with volcanic ash, the tear remained undetected for several years until the region experienced heavy rainfall and water gushing through it squeezed out the layer of ash. Following this the massive crack swallowed up a portion of the Nairobi highway.', 'A crack that opened up in Kenya’s Rift Valley, damaging a section of the Narok-Nairobi highway, is still growing...🇰🇪 pic.twitter.com/Uzjs3H8Lp2', '', ""Currently, the colossal crack appears in the EARS, a network of valleys that's about 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers) long, from the Red Sea to Mozambique. Geologists believe that this crack is rupturing the African plate into two separate parts, the larger Nubian plate and the smaller Somali plate. Live Science explains that the Somali plate is pulling eastward from the Nubian plate. Additionally, both of these plates are also breaking apart from the Arabian plate in the north, creating a V-shaped rift system in the Afar region of Ethiopia."", 'Apparently Africa is slowly splitting apart into two continents. pic.twitter.com/jFMJxBHP7a', '', '“The East African Rift started forming about 35 million years ago between Arabia and the Horn of Africa in the eastern part of the continent,” Cynthia Ebinger, chair of geology at Tulane University in New Orleans, told Live Science. About 25 million years ago, this rift started stretching southward and pulling apart northern Kenya.', 'via GIPHY', '', 'The cause behind the crack, according to BBC, was “huge volcanic eruptions called flood basalts – which send lava gushing from emerging fissures like flood waters – and fractured the brittle continental crust into a series of faults.” Another reason could be soil erosion, as Lucía Pérez Díaz from the Royal Holloway University of London wrote in The Conversation. She explained that geologists think that this crack is an erosional gully, although questions remain about its formation in the specific location. They are trying to find out of its appearance has anything to do with the East African Rift. The crack could be the result of the erosion of soft soils into gap caused by the rift.', 'But is it alarming that Africa, the second-largest continent, may split apart? If Africa is ripped apart, there are different ways in which that might happen. One scenario has most of the Somalian plate separating from the rest of the African continent, with a sea forming between them. This new landmass would include Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and the eastern parts of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique, Ebinger said. So, Africa is indeed splitting into two continents, but, as Ebinger noted, the process may take another million to 5 million years. ""The rifting right now is very slow, about the rate that one\'s toenails grow,"" Ken Macdonald, a distinguished professor emeritus of Earth science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told Live Science.', '']"
