This event was recorded as a “guest star” by Chinese and Japanese observers, with several adding interesting details. One medieval chronicle compared it to the view of Saturn and added that “its colour was bluish-red and it had rays.” Meanwhile, a Japanese imperial courtier wrote in his diary that people in the court worried that it was “a sign of abnormality indicating that at any moment we can expect control of the administration to be lost.”', 'Now known as the supernova SN 1181, it is one of a few supernovae to be documented before the invention of telescopes. In addition, it remained an “orphan” the longest, meaning that none of the celestial objects visible today could be assigned to it. SN 1181’s remnant has only been traced in 2021 to the nebula Pa 30, found in 2013 by amateur astronomer Dana Patchick while examining an archive of images from the WISE telescope as part of a citizen scientist project.', 'But this nebula is not a typical supernova remnant. In fact, astronomers were intrigued to find a surviving “zombie star” at its center, a remnant within the remnant. The 1181 supernova is thought to have occurred when a thermonuclear explosion was triggered on a dense, dead star called a white dwarf. Typically, the white dwarf would be completely destroyed in this type of explosion, but in this case, some of the star survived, leaving behind a sort of “zombie star.” This type of partial explosion is called a Type Iax supernova. Even more intriguingly, strange filaments emanated from this zombie star, resembling the petals of a dandelion flower. Now, ISTA Assistant Professor Ilaria Caiazzo and lead author Tim Cunningham, a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, get an unprecedented close-up view of these strange filaments.', 'The team around Cunningham and Caiazzo could study this strange supernova remnant in detail thanks to Caltech’s Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). KCWI is a spectrograph located above 4,000 meters at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, near the summit of Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii’s highest peak.', 'As its name indicates, KCWI was designed to detect some of the faintest and darkest sources of light in the universe, collectively called the “cosmic web”. In addition, KCWI is so sensitive and smartly designed that it can capture spectral information for every pixel in an image. It can also measure the motion of matter in a stellar explosion, creating something like a 3D movie of a supernova. KCWI does so by examining how the light shifts while moving closer to or away from us, a physical process similar to the familiar Doppler shift we know from blaring sirens that change their tune as an ambulance races by.', 'Thus, instead of only seeing the typical static image of a fireworks display common to observations of supernovae, the researchers could create a detailed 3D map of the nebula and its strange filaments. In addition, they could show that the material in the filaments traveled ballistically at approximately 1,000 kilometers per second. “This means that the ejected material has not been slowed down, or sped up, since the explosion,” says Cunningham. “Thus, from the measured velocities, looking back in time allowed us to pinpoint the explosion to almost exactly the year 1181.”', 'Beyond the dandelion-shaped filaments and their ballistic expansion, the overall shape of the supernova is most unusual. The team could demonstrate that the ejecta—the material within the filaments being ejected away from the explosion site—is unusually asymmetrical. This suggests that the asymmetry stems from the initial explosion itself.

New observation of a supernova explosion that was witnessed in the year 1181,https://www.techexplorist.com/observation-supernova-explosion-witnessed-year-1181/91544/,"['In 1181, a bright new star appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. This star was actually a supernova or an exploding star. Chinese and Japanese astronomers noted this event.', 'For many years, scientists have searched for the remnants of this explosion. In 2013, amateur astronomer Dana Patchick discovered a nebula called Pa 30, which was found to be the leftover material from the supernova.', 'In 2023, astronomers spotted strange, dandelion-like filaments in the remnants. Using advanced tools at a Hawaiian observatory, they have created a 3D map of these filaments and measured how fast they are moving away from the explosion site.', 'Caltech professor of physics Christopher Martin, who led the team that built KCWI, said, “A standard image of the supernova remnant would be like a static photo of a fireworks display. KCWI gives us something more like a ‘movie’ since we can measure the motion of the explosion’s embers as they streak outward from the central explosion.”', 'The 1181 supernova happened when a white dwarf star exploded unusually, leaving behind a “zombie star.” This type of explosion, a Type Iax supernova, was fainter than typical supernovae, matching what historical records described. The debris from this explosion forms the Pa 30 nebula we see today.', 'Scientists know that the supernova created glowing filaments of sulfur in the nebula, but they are still figuring out how and when they formed. To study the supernova’s structure in 3D, astronomers used an instrument called KCWI, which breaks light into different colors for each part of an image.', 'This helped them measure the movement of the filaments. They found that material moving toward us appears blue (blue-shifted), while material moving away looks red (red-shifted).', 'The study of the 1181 supernova used a technique similar to how we hear sound changes when a firetruck passes by. As the truck approaches, the sound gets higher; as it moves away, the sound gets lower.', 'For this research, astronomers utilized the KCWI instrument’s “red arm,” which was recently added to improve its capabilities. This new part doubled the range of light it can capture, allowing for detailed observations of the Pa 30 nebula.', 'The findings showed that the filaments from the explosion move outward at about 1,000 kilometers per second. The material in these filaments is expanding consistently, meaning it hasn’t changed speed since the explosion, helping scientists pinpoint the explosion to around 1181.', 'The 3D mapping also revealed a large empty space inside the nebula and suggested that the explosion wasn’t perfectly symmetrical.', 'Tim Cunningham, a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics |Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA), said, “As to how the filaments formed after the blast, the scientists are still puzzled. A reverse shock wave may be condensing surrounding dust into filaments, but we don’t know yet. The morphology of this object is very strange and fascinating.”', 'Journal Reference:', '']"

This actually made the supernova, now designated SN 1181, one of the few supernovas observed before the invention of the telescope. In 2021, amateur astronomer Dana Patchick tracked SN 1181 back to its location in the nebula Pa 30 that\'s situated within the Milky Way, determining the supernova erupted around 1,000 years ago (about 200 years before our ancestors spotted and documented it).

This is because white dwarfs like this zombie star shouldn't have survived the cosmic horror show that birthed them."", 'SN 1181 is part of a sub-class of supernova called ""Type Ia supernovas."" These kinda of supernovas are usually so uniform that astronomers refer to them as standard candles because it\'s possible to use them when measuring celestial distances. To be clear, these aren\'t the type of supernovas that mark the death of a star when the star runs out of fuel needed for nuclear fusion and collapses under the influence of its own gravity (leaving a black hole or neutron star in is wake). ', 'Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!', ""Instead, Type Ia supernovas begin with a dead star, one that is ravenously feeding from a stellar companion. These cosmic ghouls are white dwarfs, the kind of stellar corpse the sun will also leave behind when it dies in around 6 billion years.

This results in ""Roche lobe overflow,"" with matter flowing from this donor star to the white dwarf, causing the white dwarf to spring back to life.', ""However, this situation can't continue forever. Just like Lee's Dracula often did, these white dwarfs eventually get a touch too greedy."", '', ""As the white dwarf feeds from its cosmic companion, the material it strips away can't fall directly to the dead star because the material still has angular momentum. This means that material forms a swirling flattened cloud, called an accretion disk, around the white dwarf that gradually feeds it. Yet, despite a slowed delivery, this stolen stellar matter still piles up on the surface of the white dwarf, causing it to become unstable."", 'The situation ends with a thermonuclear explosion that completely destroys the white dwarf. But this cosmic horror story doesn\'t always have such a neat ending; sometimes, there is a sequel in the offing. That is because, in very rare occasions, the white dwarf star isn\'t completely destroyed in the supernova. Instead, it lives on as a shattered remnant, or ""zombie star.""', 'These occurrences are called ""Type-Iax supernovas,"" and astronomers think they could account for as little as 5% of Type Ia supernovas. As you may have guessed, SN 1181 is an example of a Type-Iax supernova.', '', 'The Type-Iax supernova in the nebula Pa 30 has left this zombie star one of the hottest stellar bodies in the Milky Way, with an estimated surface temperature of around 360,000 degrees Fahrenheit (200,000 degrees Celsius). For comparison, the sun has a surface temperature of around 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius).', ""Additionally, this zombie star violently lashes out at the rest of its home nebula with stellar winds that reach speeds of 36 million miles per hour. That's about 45,000 times as fast as the speed of sound when measured here on Earth, or 25,000 times as fast as the top speed of a Lockheed Martin F-16 jet fighter (clearly, this undead star is not one of those traditional slow zombies, as seen roaming throughout a George Romero flick)."", 'Such violent nature makes this shattered white dwarf an ideal candidate for the study of these rare supernovas, and that is exactly what Cunningham, Caiazz and colleagues set about doing. ', ""To conduct this investigation, the team turned to data collected by the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI).

The 3D modeling has left some questions that still need to be answered. For instance, the team found that, beyond the dandelion-shaped filaments and their ballistic expansion, the overall shape of the supernova was not what was expected."", 'Cunningham, Caiazzo and colleagues demonstrated that the material flung away by the supernova, and sealed within the filaments, is strangely asymmetrical.
