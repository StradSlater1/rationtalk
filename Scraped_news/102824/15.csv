"U.S. ""seeing evidence"" of North Korean troops in Russia as Ukraine war rages, Defense chief Lloyd Austin says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korean-troops-in-russia-us-austin-says-ukraine-war-vladimir-putin-kim-jong-un/,"['Watch CBS News', ""By Charlie D'Agata"", 'Updated on: October 23, 2024 / 8:23 PM EDT / CBS News', 'Washington — Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Tuesday that the U.S. was ""seeing evidence that there are North Korean troops in Russia,"" offering the first comments by a senior U.S. official on the seemingly expanding ties between two major U.S. adversaries.  South Korean officials first raised the alarm about the North Korean deployments to Russia last week, saying Seoul\'s intelligence agencies had evidence that North Korean commandos were sent to Russia on their way to join Moscow\'s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.', '""Exactly what they\'re doing is left to be seen,"" Austin said of the North Korean troops in Russia. He made the remarks to reporters during a visit to Rome.', ""He said if the North Korean troops were about to become active participants in Russia's war in Ukraine, it would be an indication that Putin — whose forces have been making territorial gains in recent months — could be in more trouble than many people realize. Some officials believe the gains along the front line in Ukraine have come at the cost of many thousands of Russian troops."", 'South Korean officials suspect the Northern troops are being trained in Russia to fight on that front line. South Korean intelligence estimates suggest there are now about 3,000 Northern troops in Russia, but Ukrainian officials have been following the matter closely, too, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and officials in South Korea have said the North could deploy more than 10,000 troops to Russia by the end of the year.', 'Ukrainian officials say they have not seen North Koreans fighting in the country yet, but the government in Kyiv issued a statement Wednesday calling on any North Korean troops fighting for Russia to surrender.', ""Defense officials in Washington have told CBS News that any impact North Korean forces could have on the battlefield will depend on how well trained and equipped they are and whether they're used as elite commandos and advisors, or just to pad out flagging force numbers."", 'North Korea has been supplying Russia with artillery for its war in Ukraine for months.', ""But more important than North Korean troops' potential battlefield impact are the wider implications of greater support for Putin's war by Kim Jong Un's isolated, nuclear-armed regime."", 'At a rare in-person summit in North Korea in June, Putin and Kim signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement, publicly expanding their economic and military cooperation to show a united front against Washington. ', 'The pact saw the leaders pledge to defend the other if either country was to come under attack, but officials in the U.S. and other Western capitals believe Russia, above all, has been keen to ensure a steady supply of North Korean weapons for its Ukraine war.', ""The U.S. and South Korea have been concerned for months that in return for Kim's cooperation and support, Russia could provide North Korea with nuclear and advanced ballistic missile technology."", 'In light of the information about Kim sending troops to Russia, South Korea has threatened to supply Ukraine with weapons — something it has resisted doing since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of his neighboring country in February 2022.', 'North Korea\'s government has not commented on the alleged deployment of troops to Russia. Moscow has dismissed it as ""another fabrication.""', 'Margaret Brennan contributed to this report.', ""Charlie D'Agata is CBS News' senior national security correspondent. He was previously a senior foreign correspondent and has spent more than two decades covering international news for CBS."", '© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Biden administration avoided commenting on the assessment until Wednesday as the government separately confirmed the intelligence.', 'As Austin’s comment showed, the most immediate theme from American officials was uncertainty. Neither the Pentagon nor the White House said it knew why the soldiers were in Russia, what North Korea was getting in return or whether they would fight in Ukraine.', 'If that last concern proves true, White House spokesperson John Kirby said, they would be “fair game” for the Ukrainian military.', 'Russia has suffered huge casualties in recent months while making steady gains in Ukraine’s east, losing more than 1,000 troops a day and surpassing 600,000 total casualties since 2022, American officials have said.', '“This is certainly a highly concerning probability: After completing training, these soldiers could travel to western Russia and then engage in combat against the Ukrainian military,” Kirby said, noting that the U.S. has briefed the Ukrainian government on its intelligence.', 'Austin traveled unannounced to Kyiv earlier this week in his fourth and likely last trip to Ukraine as secretary. While there, he spoke with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and unveiled another $400 million package of military aid, the second such tranche within a week.', 'North Korea and Russia have had a distant relationship dating back to the end of the Cold War, but have moved closer in the last two years. The two countries’ leaders have met together, including in a rare trip by Kim Jong Un outside his country to visit Vladimir Putin.', 'U.S. officials cast the news as a sign of “desperation” from Russia, particularly if North Korean troops joined the fight. The description has become familiar for the Biden administration, which didn’t anticipate how the war in Ukraine would realign American adversaries such as Iran, which alongside North Korea has also sent weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.', 'North Korea has shipped over 16,500 containers of munitions and related material to Russia since last fall, U.S. and European officials have said.', '“This is an indication that [Putin] may be even in more trouble than most people realize. But, again, he went tin cupping early on to get additional weapons and materials from the DPRK and then from Iran. And now he’s making a move to get more people,” Austin said, using the initialism for North Korea’s government.', 'Noah Robertson is the Pentagon reporter at Defense News.

North Korea’s arrival is no triumph for Putin in Ukraine,https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/putin-north-korea-troops-ukraine-war-cost-rxs5wpj89,"['A\nphotograph of the North Korean flag flying outside the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk has spread despondency among its defenders. President Zelensky says North Korean troops have joined the fighting this weekend, although Washington is being more cautious, suggesting that they are only undergoing training. Nonetheless, most sources agree that they have arrived in Russia.', 'President Putin has long spoken of his vision of a “multipolar” world. He argues that the world would be better off if, instead of the American dominance seen since the end of the Cold War, there were a number of superpowers of varying ideologies, prominent among them authoritarian Russia.', 'The presence of North Korean troops in Russia seems a victory for this idea. However, just as the West should not take this out of proportion — this is not the start of a new world war — Putin should realise that this movement towards multipolarity, evident at the well-attended Brics summit in Kazan, is not a process he can control.', '• How strong is North Korea’s military?', 'North Korea has long been providing ordnance for Russia, and with them some technical specialists, especially associated with use of its KN-23 tactical ballistic missiles, which have proved temperamental, often misfiring or exploding in mid-air. Six North Korean technicians were killed this month in a Ukrainian strike on Donetsk.', 'The apparent arrival of North Korean combat troops from the elite XI Corps, known as the “storm corps” in the Russian Far East, in numbers ranging from 1,500 to 12,000 according to various reports, represents a significant deepening of Pyongyang’s commitment to Russia but does not necessarily mean that they are intended for immediate combat. Instead, they may be used for rear-area security operations, freeing up Russians for the front.', 'While these are sometimes described as special forces, they are hardly analogous to British Marines or paras, let alone the SAS. They are, to be fair, more “special” than most of the 950,000 ordinary troops in the Korean People’s Army, and are considered to be physically tough, disciplined and well-drilled.', 'They have no actual combat experience, though, and the war has highlighted how crucial this is. Deploying them directly into battle would also be problematic. Although most North Koreans speak some Russian, the risks of miscommunication and friendly fire incidents would be considerable. Pyongyang would also be worried about the risk of defections to Ukraine.', 'Either way, the importance of even 12,000 new troops needs to be kept in context. The Russians are losing that many men in every ten days of fighting. This would not change the basic arithmetic of the war.', 'Besides, Kim Jong-un is not helping Putin out of kindness. A new “comprehensive strategic partnership” ratified by the Russian parliament on Thursday commits Moscow to providing direct military support to North Korea if it is attacked.', 'Russia is having to pay for North Korea’s often substandard ordnance and, maybe substandard soldiers, with not just food and raw materials, but also technology. Even if one excludes claims that Moscow is directly helping Kim’s nuclear weapons programme, Russia is providing its expertise in rocketry, aviation technology and cybersecurity.', 'There are Russian commentators concerned that Putin is selling off the family silver to gain short-term respite. After Russian troops have fired the eight million artillery rounds that Moscow bought North Korea can sell it more, but technology can only be sold once.', 'The Brics summit in Russia was on the surface a political triumph for Putin but actually demonstrated the limits of his attempts to create an anti-western alliance.', 'As rotating chair of the group, Putin was able to host this year’s gathering, and so Kazan, the capital of Russia’s republic of Tatarstan, was put on display, with the state media proclaiming that it was “the capital of the world for three days”.', 'Putin could use his podium to claim that the group represented an alternative vision of the global order, and the presence of António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, who had ignored an invitation to Kyiv’s first peace summit, and President Erdogan of Turkey, a member of Nato, represented propaganda coups.', 'However, most of the existing, and potential, members, while sharing a desire to see a world less dominated by western values and interests, are not interested in directly opposing it.', 'Besides, while Putin claimed that 34 countries had expressed an interest in closer relations with the organisation, the only members to join the original five — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — have been Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Even countries once regarded as virtually within Moscow’s sphere of influence, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan, have chosen not to join.', 'It is increasingly clear that the West’s capacity to shape the world is being challenged. Last week, a senior American diplomat glumly admitted to me that “this whole war is something of a wake-up call for us. Back in 2021, we could still kid ourselves that we were masters of the universe, but the limits on [US] power and influence have become clearer.”', 'Putin has certainly been the beneficiary in many ways, with numerous countries willing to turn a blind eye to sanctions busting, hire Russian mercenaries or buy its cheap oil. But this doesn’t make them Russia’s vassals, or even really its allies. This is nothing more than a transactional process, and Putin is not in control of it. As an émigré Russian with close links to the Kremlin put it: “[Putin] does not realise, or is not willing to admit, that being unhappy with the West does not make you pro-Russian.”', 'Instead, he is having to buy his allies’ support. The Kremlin had to placate Tehran by breaking with Israel, a country with which Putin had built good relations. Beijing has been able to force Russia into energy deals on unfavourable terms, and if reports about backchannel communications between Putin and Elon Musk are true, the Russian president was forced to ask him, as a favour to President Xi of China, not to extend his Starlink satellite internet services to Taiwan .', 'Even Pyongyang, once a desperate pariah state, can deal with Moscow as an equal.', 'The irony is that the West and the Kremlin alike overstate the unity of the anti-western forces, and the degree to which Putin is able to bend them to his will.', 'He looked confident at Kazan, but in practice he failed to make any serious progress on his key priorities. “De-dollarisation”, reducing reliance on the US dollar in international trade, is one such, but while China is supportive, Brazil and India are lukewarm. Although the dollar is receding in certain sectors, Brics is not driving this.', 'Putin hustled in vain for a statement supporting Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The best he could do was to say in his closing speech that “everyone is committed to ensuring that the conflict ends as quickly as possible and by peaceful means”. But China and India distanced themselves from Putin’s aggressive rhetoric and implicitly backed a negotiated end to the war.', 'Talk of the “axis of resistance”, “axis of upheaval” or “Crink” — for what George Robertson, the former Nato secretary-general called the “deadly” alliance between China, Russia and North Korea — risks underplaying the serious divisions between these nations.', 'Each country has its own agenda, and is ruthless in pursuing it. Beijing does not want Putin defeated in Ukraine but nor is it willing to risk secondary sanctions for him. Moscow is desperately hoping that it is never dragged by China into a wider war against Taiwan. Pyongyang and Tehran will both arm Russia but for pay, not fellowship.', 'Putin ultimately can have all the fair-weather friends he wants.

Officials in Seoul summoned the Russian ambassador on Monday to condemn intensifying military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow. Meanwhile, Britain’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Barbara Woodward, informed the UN Security Council that it was “highly likely” North Korea had agreed to send combat troops in support of Russia’s war against Ukraine.', 'If confirmed, North Korea’s decision to provide Russian President Vladimir Putin with soldiers would further deepen the Hermit Kingdom’s involvement in an invasion that is already the largest European war since World War II. The United States first accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells in September 2022. Putin and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, have since gone on to hold a number of high-profile meetings. In June 2024, the two dictators signed a mutual defense pact, underlining the strengthening security cooperation between their nations.', 'As the invasion of Ukraine has progressed, Russia’s reliance on North Korea has reportedly grown. In October 2024, Britain’s The Times newspaper cited Western intelligence estimates indicating that North Korea was now supplying half of all the artillery shells used by the Russian army in Ukraine. North Korea is also believed to be providing ballistic missiles for Russia’s campaign of aerial bombardment against Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. The use of North Korean-supplied missiles by the Russian military in Ukraine was first confirmed in December 2023, according to US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.', 'The ballistic missiles reportedly being supplied by North Korea have a range of up to 690 kilometers and are extremely difficult to shoot down with Ukraine’s existing patchwork of air defense systems. This makes them a very significant addition to Putin’s arsenal. North Korea’s capacity to produce such weapons hinges on Pyongyang’s ability to bypass sanctions on key missile components produced in the West.', 'Research conducted by the Kyiv-based Independent Anti-Corruption Commission, which I chair, has recently identified a number of Western components in a North Korean missile that was shot down in central Ukraine’s Poltava region during early September 2024. Inspection of the missile confirmed the presence of microelectronics manufactured in the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It was particularly striking to note that many of these components had been produced as recently as 2022 or 2023.', 'This is not a new problem, of course. Indeed, international audiences are no longer particularly shocked or even surprised by the latest revelations of Western components in Russian rockets and Iranian drones. Nevertheless, news that restricted Western technologies are making their way to one of the world’s most sanctioned and famously isolated countries should now strengthen calls for the introduction of far tighter export controls.', '', 'AN #ACFRONTPAGE EVENT—2022 Nobel Peace Prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk discusses ongoing threats to democracy and the worldwide gathering of authoritarian forces—and how those topics converge in Ukraine. ', '', 'More than two and a half years since the start of the invasion, Western tech is still playing an important part in Russia’s war effort. Moscow, Tehran, and Pyongyang are all heavily dependent on components produced by companies across Europe and North America, and have evidently found ways to keep illicit delivery channels open.', 'As policymakers in Western capitals search for an appropriate response to the anticipated appearance of North Korean soldiers in Europe, this technological dependency is one obvious vulnerability. If supplies of components could be dramatically reduced, Russia and its allies would soon find that they lacked the parts for the mass production of missiles and drones. This could significantly hamper the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.', 'In order to achieve this, Western governments should scrutinize their own sanctions policies, while looking to work more closely together to coordinate sanctions implementation. The export of militarily sensitive high-tech components should be subject to much stricter regulations and far tougher policing. For individual companies, this may involve accepting a greater degree of accountability for overseeing product movement and end delivery.', 'Far more attention must also be paid to the intermediary role being played by countries including China. There must be serious penalties for feeding the weapons component needs of sanctioned states such as Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Existing secondary sanctions measures are evidently not working and need to be significantly more comprehensive.', 'The arrival of North Korean troops in Ukraine would be an historically unprecedented event for all Europeans and a major wake-up call for the entire Western world. It is already abundantly clear that Putin and his authoritarian partners are working to establish an Axis of Autocrats. This alliance of tyrants is explicitly anti-Western in character and has global ambitions that extend far beyond the borders of Ukraine. Indeed, the entire Axis is bound together by a shared desire to destroy the existing world order.', 'Putin’s Axis of Autocrats may hate the West, but they remain heavily reliant on Western technologies. This is confirmed by physical evidence and intelligence findings from Ukraine. In other words, Russia has invaded a European country using weapons that would literally not exist without parts imported from companies across Europe and North America. If Western leaders want to undermine Putin’s war machine, one of the first steps should be to prevent Russia and its allies from acquiring the Western components they need to maintain their defense industries and supply their armies.', 'Olena Tregub is Executive Director of Ukraine’s Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO).', 'UkraineAlert\nOct 15, 2024', 'By Kate Spencer', 'Few countries have more at stake in the coming US presidential election than Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on US aid to sustain its fight against Russia’s ongoing invasion, writes Kate Spencer.', 'UkraineAlert\nOct 15, 2024', 'By Marcel Plichta', 'Ukraine may allow the export of drones in a bid to boost domestic production amid limited state procurement budgets and to prevent Ukrainian drone manufacturers from relocating abroad, writes Marcel Plichta.', 'UkraineAlert\nOct 17, 2024', 'By Tetiana Kotelnykova', 'The Kremlin is conducting a massive indoctrination campaign throughout schools in Russian-occupied Ukraine that underlines Moscow’s intention to erase Ukrainian national identity, writes Tetiana Kotelnykova.', 'The views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.', '', 'UkraineAlert is a comprehensive online publication that provides regular news and analysis on developments in Ukraine’s politics, economy, civil society, and culture.', 'The Eurasia Center’s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.', ""Image: Russia's President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un attend a state reception in Pyongyang, North Korea June 19, 2024.

Russia-DPRK Relations: Strategic Partnership or Opportunistic Alliance?,https://www.38north.org/2024/10/russia-dprk-relations-strategic-partnership-or-opportunistic-alliance/,"['Europe’s deadliest armed conflict in nearly 80 years has put Russia-DPRK relations into overdrive, with Russia’s need for outside assistance fueling the development of deep military cooperation. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) leader Kim Jong Un have established a personal rapport with each other, one driven in large measure by a shared animosity of US foreign policy and what both perceive—rightly or wrongly—to be an overbearing United States desperately seeking to maintain hegemony in Europe and East Asia.', 'Two questions naturally arise. First, how deep does the Russia-DPRK relationship go? And second, can it now be categorized as an alliance in the same vein as what the United States shares with South Korea and Japan? The answers are not mutually exclusive; just because Moscow and Pyongyang are collaborating more seamlessly than they have in the past does not necessarily mean either one expects a full-scale alliance to be established as a result or that they are even interested in such an arrangement. What the two countries boast at the present moment is, if anything, a marriage of convenience fueled by self-interest, a desire to counter Washington’s strengthening of its own alliance system, and a firmly-held belief in Moscow and Pyongyang that the United States is trying to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe with its bilateral alliances in East Asia. The war in Ukraine, where Japan—which signed a 10-year security agreement with Kyiv in June with an accompanying $4.5 billion in non-military aid—and South Korea (to a more limited extent) are members of the US-organized sanctions regime against Russia, only reaffirms this belief in the minds of Russian and North Korean officials.', 'North Korean Troops on Their Way to Ukraine', 'US experts increasingly describe the Russia-DPRK relationship as a key node in a broader axis of authoritarians aiming to upend the so-called rules-based international order. News of North Korean troop deployments to Russia has reinforced the discourse. On October 17, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alleged that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops were being mobilized to join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, assessed that North Korean personnel would be ready to enter the fight by November 1. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service went a step further in its own assessment, claiming that 3,000 North Korean troops are already training inside Russia for combat operations.', 'How those troops will be used is still a mystery. As Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin suggested, it is possible Putin could deploy the North Koreans as shock troops on the frontline, particularly in Donetsk, where ongoing Russian offensives near the Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokvrosk have caused extensive casualties on the Russian side. Others speculate that North Korean units might be stationed in Russia’s Kursk province, a portion of which the Ukrainian army continues to hold ground after a surprise August offensive, in order to free up Russian personnel for duties at the front.', 'Yet for Washington and Seoul, how Russia chooses to deploy North Korean reinforcements is less important than the fact that Moscow and Pyongyang are now gearing up to fight on the same side. Even before news of the North Korean troop movements emerged, US Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell stressed that the Kim regime’s material support to the Russians was “creating further instability in Europe.” The Biden administration has spent well over a year arguing that the nexus between these two authoritarian powers is a danger not only to European stability but to the stability of East Asia as well. This is consistent with the emerging conventional theme percolating in Washington, Berlin, and Tokyo that security in Europe and Asia is inextricably linked.', 'South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration is even more emphatic about the risks of Russia-DPRK military ties, calling it both unacceptable and illegal given the multiple United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions prohibiting such activity, regardless of the treaty the two countries signed in June. On October 21, the South Korean Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul and demanded an immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops; a day later, the Yoon administration threatened to provide Ukraine with direct military assistance if military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang continued, a countermeasure Yoon reiterated personally this week. Such a course of action, however, is easier said than done for South Korea, which is barred by law from exporting lethal weapons to a country at war.', 'Russia-DPRK Relations Rise to New Heights', 'North Korean troops fighting in Ukraine would be an unprecedented situation. While Pyongyang has been involved in third-party conflicts in the past—North Korean pilots aided North Vietnam during the 1960s, for instance—never before has the Kim regime ordered so many North Korean ground personnel into a war that, objectively speaking, is of tertiary importance to North Korea’s own security. Whether or not Russia proves victorious in Ukraine is immaterial to the Kim regime’s longevity or Kim Jong Un’s own rule. The question, therefore, must be asked: knowing this, why would Pyongyang inject itself into a war of attrition over 4,200 miles away?', 'The most straightforward explanation is that Kim is fully invested in bolstering his strategic relationship with Putin’s Russia and believes the cost of North Korean casualties—an inevitable result if the troops are sent to Donetsk—is worth the benefits of keeping Moscow close to Pyongyang. Although some will brand this as overly simplistic, there is some merit to the argument. North Korea, after all, has already been involved in Ukraine, albeit in an indirect capacity, since at least September 2022, when the first reports of North Korean munitions shipments to the Russian army surfaced publicly. According to C4ADS, a global security nonprofit, more than 74,000 metric tons of North Korean munitions were shipped to Russian ports in the Far East between August 2023 and January 2024. In August, South Korean military officials estimated that Pyongyang delivered 13,000 containers to Russia through the port in Rason, a significant uptick from the previous estimate of 7,000 containers in March. North Korean munitions factories are reportedly working around the clock to produce the basic munitions and artillery shells the Russian army needs to maintain its offensive in the face of formidable Ukrainian resistance. Moscow has also occasionally employed North Korean short-range ballistic missiles against Ukrainian targets, although their effectiveness is suspect.', 'Outside of Ukraine, North Korea and Russia have elevated their bilateral relationship. Senior Russian and North Korean officials now meet on a fairly regular basis. In July 2023, a Russian military delegation led by then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu flew to the North Korean capital; two months later, Kim Jong Un made the trip to Russia’s far east, his first foreign visit in more than four years, where he toured the Vostochny Cosmodrome with Putin as well as an aircraft plant in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Putin’s June 2024 trip to North Korea was even more substantive in terms of deliverables, culminating in the signing of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that commits both sides to deeper collaboration in the military domain and mutual security assistance if either was attacked by a foreign power.', 'The Kim regime, of course, is not doing any of this for free. Like any leader who makes an arrangement with another country, Kim is expecting the agreement to bring about benefits to his regime—in other words, Russia needs to compensate Pyongyang if it wants to maintain the present state of the relationship or improve it to new heights. Fortunately for the North Koreans, the Russian government is following through.', 'On the political front, Russia’s obligations to North Korea are most prominently displayed at the UN Security Council, where Pyongyang is used to being ostracized by the great powers over any number of sins, from the development of its nuclear and missile programs to its ongoing human rights abuses. Due in large measure to Russia’s diplomatic support, the UNSC has become paralyzed on North Korea, with sessions on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program having long descended into unproductive finger-pointing. The Russians (with backing from China) have repeatedly blocked the passage of new sanctions on North Korea at the Security Council and continue to call for an easing of sanctions for humanitarian purposes. This March, Moscow used its veto power to kill the UN Panel of Experts monitoring the implementation (and evasion) of sanctions against North Korea, an action that was also self-serving given Russia’s own sanctions violations, including the importation of North Korean arms and the export of refined petroleum above Security Council-mandated levels. With the Panel in tatters, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been forced to construct an alternative multilateral monitoring mechanism outside the UN system, adding to the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing the sanctions.', 'A Hostile Alliance in the Making?', 'Considering the state of the Russia-DPRK relationship today, prominent US foreign policy experts are increasingly employing the word “alliance” to categorize it. Still, others have boldly labeled the arrangement a “full-fledged military alliance circa [the] Cold War,” claiming the obligations embedded in the comprehensive strategic partnership accord will be durable over the long term. The pending deployment of thousands of North Korean foot soldiers to Russia will only amplify these arguments in the days and weeks to come.', 'Yet “alliance” is a loaded term. It suggests, for instance, that Russia and North Korea have identical—or at least similar—values and interests, are obligated to fight for one another during a security crisis and at the very least will sustain current ties decades into the future. In reality, the strategic partnership is built on a weaker foundation than is presently assumed, motivated by a common adversary in the United States and fueled by a combination of desperation, convenience and a lack of other alternatives. Russia and North Korea are strengthening their bonds not out of a shared affinity for each other but rather because both sides view the relationship as in their respective self-interests. The unique geopolitical circumstances of the day help as well. Putin views Kim as useful for the moment, while Kim likely views Putin as a big chip to be played in his dance with Washington, Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing.', 'North Korea’s direct participation in Ukraine is no exception to the rule. Russia’s foreign policy machinery and its defense-industrial base are now, seemingly, in complete service to the war in Ukraine. Every other Russian foreign and defense policy priority is subservient to the objective of winning the war or at least ending it on terms Moscow finds acceptable. Russia’s willingness to sustain such punishment for the sake of victory demonstrates just how vital the war is to the Russian political elite. The costs have been significant. Economically and politically, the war has burned Russia’s bridges to the West, which up until 2022 was Russia’s biggest buyer of crude oil, for the foreseeable future. Geopolitically, Moscow is more reliant on China than ever—and despite Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proclamations of a Russia-China partnership without limits, Beijing is seeking to exploit its superior position vis-à-vis Moscow to finalize bilateral projects—like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline—on the cheap.', 'Notwithstanding the recent territorial advances in Donetsk, Russia’s military losses are astronomical. While the accuracy of war-time projections should always be challenged, US officials gave a provisional tally of more than 600,000 Russian dead and wounded since the conflict began. September was reportedly the bloodiest month of the war for the Russians, with Moscow losing about 1,200 personnel a day. These casualties are coming at a time when Putin, wary of provoking unrest in places like Moscow and St. Petersburg, is doing everything short of a full-scale national mobilization to re-pad the Russian army’s ranks. While 12,000 North Korean soldiers will not do much to alleviate Russia’s workforce issues, their deployment would nevertheless give the Kremlin some additional time to reassess its options. Putin needs as many bodies as he can get, no matter where they come from or even how effective they may be on the battlefield.', 'On the surface, Pyongyang looks like it gets the short end of the stick. North Korea, after all, is making most of the sacrifices. If reports are correct, the Kim regime is making a deliberate decision to potentially sacrifice thousands of its own citizens in a war whose outcome will not impact North Korea’s security situation. Yet it is not a total loss for the Kim regime either; indeed, if it were, Kim would not consider a deployment, let alone authorize it.', 'First, any North Korean troops sent to fight in Ukraine will acquire the kind of battlefield experience that the Korean People’s Army (KPA) currently lacks. This should not be understated; the last time the KPA fought a large-scale conventional conflict was the 1950-1953 Korean War. The Kim regime has devoted a significant portion of its annual gross domestic product to its military and weapons of mass destruction programs in the seven decades since but remains grossly under-funded and under-equipped on the key defense platforms—fighter and bomber aircraft, air defense systems and logistics infrastructure to name a few—required to wage a successful military campaign. Indeed, one of the primary reasons why the Kim regime spends so lavishly on its nuclear and missile programs is because the KPA’s conventional capability is qualitatively inferior to its adversaries. Assisting the Russians in Ukraine can provide the KPA with the institutional knowledge of what systems, tactics and procedures are needed for modern-day warfare.', 'Second and just as importantly, the Kim regime wants Russia in its corner. Moscow’s support is a geopolitical coup for Pyongyang, granting North Korea more flexibility and freedom of maneuver in relation to its dealings with the United States and China alike. Comfortable that it can rely on Moscow’s support, North Korea is even less worried about additional economic sanctions today than it normally is. More specifically, Pyongyang is likely receiving technology it has long coveted to develop its military satellite program, a core component of Kim’s defense modernization plans. And as relations with Russia strengthen, Kim reduces the vulnerability that comes with dependence on China, a country whose own relationship with North Korea goes through periods of romance and frostiness.', 'Conclusion', 'There is no doubt Russia-DPRK relations are at their most elevated in years, if not decades. North Korean troop deployments to Russia, North Korean arms shipments to the Russian army, Moscow’s support of Pyongyang’s position in international forums and the regular meetings between Russian and North Korean officials are a testament to this state of affairs. However, international relations is a fickle beast, and history has proven that countries aligned today may find themselves unaligned tomorrow. As long as the war in Ukraine persists, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are unlikely to have that problem. But when the war does end—and it will eventually end—the commonalities now binding Moscow and Pyongyang could give way to divergences.']"

Benjamin Harris is a CFR research associate for Europe and U.S. foreign policy.', 'North Korea has already been helping Russia sustain its firepower on the battlefield, providing it with millions of artillery shells, as well as rockets and missiles. The United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) confirmed this week that at least three thousand North Korean soldiers were sent to the Russian far east for training, seemingly to participate in Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Reportedly, between ten thousand and twelve thousand of North Korea’s elite special forces, known as the “Storm Corps,” could be sent or promised to Russia.', 'More on:', 'North Korea', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'The War in Ukraine', 'South Korean intelligence reports that these forces have been given false passports and uniforms to mask themselves as members of the Russian forces, which indicates that neither Russia nor North Korea are currently willing to publicly acknowledge these troops as “co-belligerents.”', 'South Korea and Ukraine claim that the North Korean forces are being sent to retake the Kursk region in western Russia from Ukrainian forces, after Kyiv’s surprise fall incursion. Russian President Vladimir Putin has thus far been forced to use Russian conscripts—a domestically unpopular move—for this operation.', 'In June 2024, the two countries signed a mutual defense pact that technically obligates the two to defend one another from invasions. Some scholars predicted they might use a Ukrainian incursion into Russia (such as the Kursk offensive) as a pretext for triggering the pact, but their decision to obfuscate the North Koreans’ identities indicates they are not yet doing so.', 'Russia is currently gaining on the battlefield and, therefore, unlikely acting out of desperation by deploying soldiers from North Korea. Rather, Putin is probably making this move based on tactical considerations. In helping Russia retake Kursk, the North Korean contingent can also allow Putin to focus Russian forces on their advance in eastern Ukraine, the main front where Russia has been steadily, if slowly, advancing. Heading into the winter season, it seems likely that these trends will accelerate as the Ukrainian energy crisis becomes more acute, and the U.S. election could potentially disrupt Western support for Ukraine.', 'On a strategic level, this deployment demonstrates an ominous new level of security cooperation between two actors of the so-called “axis of upheaval,” consisting of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In return for its support of Russia, North Korea most likely wants more military and economic aid and is keen to have its elite forces gain important combat experience, which they haven’t had for decades and will help modernize their military. A concerning possibility is that the June pact opened the door for Russia to provide North Korea with support for its nuclear and space programs, which would violate United Nations sanctions.', '', '', '', '', '', 'North Korea’s actions mark a dangerous, further globalization of the Russia-Ukraine war, likely bringing South Korea and other Indo-Pacific allies closer to the European theater. If North Korea and Russia increase their military cooperation, South Korea is likely to expand its support for Ukraine, including potentially lethal aid, and enmesh itself more closely in the alliance network the United States is cultivating in the Indo-Pacific.', 'In material terms, North Korea’s military is largely concentrated against South Korea, meaning that many of its capabilities are not translatable to the faraway battlefields in Russia and Ukraine. More concerning and problematic is the massive economic and military hardware support that North Korea and China provide to Russia. North Korea sent eight million shells to Ukraine last year, as well as dozens of short-range missiles, which will do far more to keep the Russian war machine afloat than a few thousand troops. Western supporters of Ukraine, by contrast, have struggled to match this provision of ammunition and weapons.', 'China has made repeated attempts to debunk Western fears about its alleged collusion with North Korea and Russia.

This could further undercut Beijing’s efforts to improve its trading relationships with the European Union (EU).

So, Leon, would you like to kick us off?', 'QUESTION: Sure. Well, for a change let me start with North Korea, if I may.', 'MR PATEL: Sure.', 'QUESTION: Yesterday you said that you were not in a position to confirm reports or the accuracy of reports of North Korean troops in Russia, mobilizing potentially for the war in Ukraine. North Korea has denied it. Do you have any new information on that, a new assessment today to give us?', 'MR PATEL: I don’t have anything new to offer on that, Leon. We are continuing to look into the reports that the DPRK has sent soldiers to fight alongside Russia. If it’s true that DPRK soldiers are joining Putin’s war against Ukraine, it certainly would mark a dangerous and highly concerning development.', 'As it relates to this, we are, of course, going to continue to consult with our allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move. Certainly, if true, it would be another reckless and dangerous action both on the side of Russia, but of course on the side of the DPRK as well. But I don’t – I’m not in a place to offer any formal assessment or confirmation from the United States today.', 'QUESTION: Can I —', 'QUESTION: Okay, but just to cover the – obviously, the South Koreans have been pretty specific on this, with numbers and a lot of information. I’m sure they’ve shared that information with you. Do you not have yet confidence in the South Korean intel?', 'MR PATEL: So, Leon, it’s not at all about confidence at all. Of course, we have a close and important partnership and relationship with our ROK partners. It is important, of course, that there – these are – there are deliberative processes as it relates to these kinds of things when we are speaking on behalf of the United States. And certainly, when I’m up here as a U.S. official speaking on these things, we want to make sure to have the most up-to-date and accurate assessment to offer you. And what I can say right now is, echoing what I said yesterday, is that we are continuing to look into those reports.', 'The most important thing, though, is that we are going to continue to consult with our allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move, but I don’t have any new, updated information to offer on that.', 'QUESTION: Can I follow up, please?', 'QUESTION: Vedant, may I?', 'MR PATEL: Nike, go ahead. I will get to you guys. Go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you. Follow on Leon’s questions.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: So South Korea said it will consider providing Ukraine with weapons for defense and attack. Would you like to comment?', 'MR PATEL: So look, I would defer to the Republic of Korea to speak to its own issues regarding its security assistance to Ukraine. We, of course, welcome any country supporting our Ukrainian partners as they continue to defend their territorial integrity and sovereignty.', 'If you recall, Nike, since the onset of Russia’s aggression we have rallied a coalition of more than 50 countries to Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s brutal aggression, and we’ll continue to work with our allies and partners to strengthen Ukrainian defense, as well as build its institutions and support Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.', 'The other thing that I want to note, Nike, since you’ve given me the opportunity, is that this is just another example of how Russia’s actions, Russia’s dangerous actions, are not just a threat to Ukrainian security or European security; they are, of course, a threat to global security. When you are seeing countries in the Indo-Pacific and Asia region also making a sovereign choice to support Ukraine in its defense, the takeaway from that, Nike, is that the whole world, not just Europe, not just NATO Allies, see the threat and the dangerousness and the recklessness from Russian action.', 'QUESTION: Yeah, South Korea.', 'MR PATEL: Janne?', 'QUESTION: Sorry. South Korea Government also said —', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Hold on.', 'QUESTION: — it will consider sending military intelligence personnel to Ukraine to help assess the battlefield tactics and also —', 'MR PATEL: I just wouldn’t have anything to offer on that. I would let the ROK speak to that. And of course, these are, ultimately, sovereign decisions for them.', 'Janne, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: Same topic, and North Korea’s military troops. The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Mike Turner, sent a letter to President Biden requesting a briefing on the North Korean military deployment. He also said that the United States and the NATO Allies should respond immediately as the situation is serious. What is the State Department’s response to this?', 'MR PATEL: So first of all, I certainly am not going to get into the weeds on congressional correspondence. What I can say is that on – in both chambers, both the House and Senate, we have an important and close working relationship. And we, of course, will continue to consult and engage with them appropriately.', 'And in the context of these reportings, as we’re – as Leon asked about reports of DPRK soldiers being sent to fight alongside Russian forces, we are continuing to look into that, continuing to assess what’s happening. And we’re, most importantly, going to continue to consult with allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move. And I have no doubt that when we say “consulting with allies and partners,” part of that, of course, means consulting with NATO Allies.', 'QUESTION: Secondly, the South Korean Government has summoned the Russian ambassador to South Korea and requested the immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops from Russia. It also announced that it would respond together with the international community. How does the United States agree to this, and what are the U.S.’s own countermeasures?', 'MR PATEL: So look, this is ultimately the – I will let the Republic of Korea speak to its own diplomatic engagements and the engagements that it might have with countries in which it has a bilateral relationship. But I think what we are seeing in practice and what we’re seeing as action is countries making it very clear that it can no longer be business as usual with the Russian Federation, and that we are seeing time and time again them taking reckless and destabilizing actions, them infringing on Ukrainian territorial integrity and sovereignty, which, as I just said to Nike, is of course not just a threat to Ukrainian security and European security, but it is of course increasingly of concern to countries in other parts of the world as well, and in this example the Republic of Korea.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Alex, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you, Vedant. Just to press you a little bit more on —', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: — the last question. The British Government, your Eye Five ally, yesterday said that it’s “highly likely,” quote/unquote, that they are – that North Korea is sending troops for Russia to take part in Ukraine. Are you telling us that they know something that you might – don’t – you might not know?', 'MR PATEL: Alex, I am saying that there is a process in place, and there are – it is – the United States, we want to be incredibly intentional and deliberate about how we talk about things publicly, and when we’re able to be in a place to talk about things confidently and with a certain assertation. I won’t speak to what processes and – other countries have in place. In the case of the United Kingdom, we noted and saw their statement during the UNSCR session on Ukraine, and I’d refer you to his majesty’s government for the UK’s assessment.', 'But as I said yesterday and just now, we are going to continue to consult with allies and partners on the implications of this, and whether this is – ends up being accurate. And we, of course, will continue to make our own assessments and look into this as well.', 'QUESTION: In the meantime, we just had some progress in your definition of this. You said “dangerous” yesterday, and today you used “reckless action.” Would that be an escalation, if true?', 'MR PATEL: I’m not going to categorize it one way or the other, Alex. What we have seen, of course, is Russia’s increasingly collaboration with a variety of malign actors. We have seen it earlier in this conflict in the closening of relationships that we have seen as it relates to Russia and Iran. And if these, of course, reports are true, it would indicate a dangerous and reckless and a closening of relationships between Russia and the DPRK, something that would certainly not be what I would call a stabilizing factor for the immediate Indo-Pacific region, but also broader global security as well.', 'QUESTION: And just come back to me later on, please.', 'MR PATEL: Sure. Nick, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Different topic.', 'MR PATEL: Of course.', 'QUESTION: I want to ask you about the intel leak on the potential Israeli response plans to Iran. Some Republicans yesterday and today are criticizing administration officials for saying they’re deeply concerned, but otherwise not taking this seriously enough. What’s your response to that?', 'And yesterday you said this topic didn’t come up in any of the Secretary’s bilats. Now that he’s in the region and having bilats today, is that still the case?', 'MR PATEL: So I don’t have anything to read out on the Secretary’s government-to-government engagements today beyond some of the readouts that we’ve already made public, and so I would refer you back to there.', 'Look, as it relates to the issues surrounding the unauthorized disclosure, I think many of you have seen the statement from the FBI, who have indicated that they are investigating this. They’ve announced that, and I will defer to them to speak to it. Certainly, we would take any unauthorized disclosure – it’s something that we take very seriously and it is, of course, incredibly concerning. There are appropriate entities of the U.S. Government that are the appropriate authorities for these kinds of things, and we, of course, will defer to them when these things happen.', 'Simon, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Can we come to Lebanon?', 'MR PATEL: Sure.', 'QUESTION: France is hosting a conference to try to make some progress on the issue. What – does the U.S. sort of support the French initiative to hold this conference, and what are you hoping will be agreed there?', 'MR PATEL: Well, look, we of course are always eager and – to engage with partners on important issues, including what is currently happening in Lebanon. We will have representation at this conference. We’ll hopefully be in a place to announce that in the next day or so, so stay tuned on that.', 'But look, when it comes to the Middle East, France has been a vital partner in continuing to marshal support for – in the context of Gaza, of course, trying to get us to a ceasefire. And similarly, we know that they share our goal as it relates to Lebanon for creating the conditions that will allow civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to return to their homes, and we know that they also would like to see 1701 effectively implemented. I have no doubt that a lot of these things will be talked about, as well as ways in which participant countries in this conference can continue to support humanitarian efforts in Lebanon as well. I expect all of this to be discussed, but I don’t want to get ahead of the conference.', 'QUESTION: You mentioned the U.S. participation, but it’s not – it hasn’t been announced as part of the Secretary’s travel. So do you expect –', 'MR PATEL: I don’t have any announcements to offer as it relates to the Secretary’s travel. The Secretary, we expect, will be in the Middle East region, as we’ve been talking about this whole week, but we will have participation at a senior level —', 'QUESTION: But —', 'MR PATEL: — at the conference.', 'QUESTION: Okay. So if you don’t send the Secretary, doesn’t that sort of signal some lesser support for this initiative?', 'MR PATEL: Not at all. We will have senior-level representation, and I will say that this is something that the Secretary himself will continue to be personally engaged on. He’s certainly talking about the issues surrounding Lebanon while he is on his travel. He is talking about it with important counterparts and interlocutors. And whatever our representation ends up being – looking like in Paris, we, of course, will be very latched up with the totality of the department.', 'And again, I think we kind of get into this back and forth of whether just simply present somewhere indicates any kind of prioritization, and that certainly is not the case. This is a priority for the Secretary. The Secretary is on travel in other parts of the world right now, but this is a vital issue to him. And we will make sure that there is senior-level representation from the United States at it.', 'QUESTION: And if the other countries there – specifically France – would like to see a ceasefire, your position, as most recently, seems to be that you don’t – you’re not calling for an immediate ceasefire. So do – is this administration out of line with European allies particularly but allies who would like to see this conflict come to an end?', 'MR PATEL: There is a – look, Simon, I will let European allies speak for themselves, but we know that there is a convergence between us and our European allies on what we all want to see, and what we all want to see ultimately is the effective implementation of 1701 but more importantly the conditions created so that civilians can return to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line. And perhaps even broader than that, we want to see the country of Lebanon be able to stand on its own two feet, out of the stranglehold from Hizballah.', 'I am not going to speculate on what proposals and ideas may come from the conference. I think that’s the purpose of these kinds of engagements, to have these important conversations in multilateral settings, and we’ll let that process move forward.', 'Jenny, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: I want to ask about the Israelis striking a hospital in southern Beirut. Does the U.S. have comment on this strike that killed more than a dozen people and left dozens more injured?', 'MR PATEL: So I’ve seen that reporting, Jenny. I don’t have any specifics that I can offer as it relates to that operation. We, of course, will let the IDF and the Israelis speak to the kinds of operations that were – that they are conducting. But look, we have been as clear as we have been that when it comes to operations that the IDF is undertaking to degrade Hizballah – which we, of course, support – that every possible measure needs to be taken to minimize impact on civilians, to minimize civilian casualties. And that one step beyond that, every possible measure needs to be taken so that civilian infrastructure – whether it be hospitals, schools, anything in that category – that impact on that needs to be minimized as well. We have asked the Israelis for additional information as it relates to this particular strike, but I don’t have anything to offer as it relates to that.', 'I think let’s also not lose sight on the fact that Hizballah is a terrorist organization that does have deep-rooted infrastructure in various corners of Lebanese society, and part of that has included Hizballah co-locating itself with civilian infrastructure. Again, as it relates to this particular hospital, I don’t have any insight that I can offer from up here, but this is something we’ll continue to engage on directly with the Israelis.', 'QUESTION: If you could —', 'QUESTION: Will the U.S. conduct its own investigation into whether every possible measure was taken here to protect civilians?', 'MR PATEL: Broadly speaking, Jenny, we have measures and levers and processes in place to ensure that international humanitarian law was abided by, that civilian harm was minimized in whatever way possible. I certainly wouldn’t speak to that in these settings, and we would not necessarily open our own investigation at this point.', 'QUESTION: Has there been any investigations into whether Israeli measures in Lebanon or Gaza have taken every possible measure to protect civilians?', 'MR PATEL: I just wouldn’t speak to ongoing or —', 'QUESTION: Can you say whether those have —', 'MR PATEL: — deliberative processes. We have —', 'QUESTION: Can you say whether other – any of those have wrapped up?', 'MR PATEL: We have talked about the tools that the United States has at its disposal to do this work basically since the onset of October 7th. I know this group is quite familiar with them – whether they be CHIRG, whether it be the Leahy Process, whether it be the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, and various other things. Those – all of those are active, ongoing things that the United States continue to have at its disposal to assess circumstances around any country in which we have a security relationship with. And that, of course, is going to continue and we’ll always be effective implementors of U.S. law.', 'Leon, I saw you had your hand up.', 'QUESTION: I’ll pass.', 'MR PATEL: Okay. All right.', 'QUESTION: Can I just ask quickly one more?', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: Did the Secretary get any commitments from the Israeli Government today that they would increase humanitarian aid to northern Gaza after the letter last week?', 'MR PATEL: Our – the Secretary, in his readout, which I know you all saw, was pretty clear in his readout that there are still many things and many progress markers that we need to see as it relates to the flow of humanitarian aid. I don’t have any specific commitments to outline beyond what was in the readout.', 'QUESTION: I ask because the Israelis don’t make any mention of it in their own readout of that meeting.', 'MR PATEL: Well, look, I am not a spokesperson for them. I’m a spokesperson for the U.S. Government, and it is something that the Secretary has placed significance – significant emphasis on, both in the letter from earlier in the month, the letter from April, but also the consistently at – consistency at which this Secretary has raised humanitarian aid. And the Secretary made very clear that there are continued areas where we need to see marked improvement.', 'Michel, and then I’ll come to you, Said. Michel, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Yeah. Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: Does the U.S. still consider the UN Security Council Resolution 1701 as the only solution for the war between Israel and Hizballah?', 'MR PATEL: We certainly do. And when – I know that there’s been a lot of interest in 1701 over the past couple of days and perhaps a little bit of misunderstanding in how – or misinterpretation in how it’s being discussed. So let me just be unequivocally clear. We – what we want to see is the effective implementation of 1701. We think that it is vital, and it can help create the conditions that will ultimately allow civilians on both sides of the Blue Line to return home.', 'The Secretary has been clear about that. I know, Michel, you always like to ask about what Special Envoy Hochstein has been up to. It’s something he has been very clear about in his travels and in his engagements as well. The Secretary reiterated that with the prime minister, as you saw in the readout that the travel team just put out. And it’s something that we will continue to stress.', 'Ultimately what we want to see here is conditions that will allow civilians to be able to return home and, beyond that, get the government and country of Lebanon to a place where it is out of the stranglehold of Hizballah and able to stand on its own two feet, be in a place where it can select a new president. All of these things we have been unequivocally consistent and clear about.', 'QUESTION: But the parties in the past, as Amos Hochstein said in Beirut, failed to implement the 1701. What would make them – or we force them – to implement at this time?', 'MR PATEL: So I’m just going to speculate, Michel, on what might or might not happen. What I am offering you is what our perspective has been in what we think is a credible and clear solution that is a step in the right direction, and we think that is the effective implementation of 1701.', 'QUESTION: And finally —', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: — Congressman LaHood and Issa sent a letter to the President asking them to put pressure and sanctions on the Speaker of the House Nabih Berri to elect a new president. Are you considering such move?', 'MR PATEL: So certainly would not – first, again, and just would not get into the details of our congressional correspondence. We engage with members at both the House and Senate pretty regularly. And certainly, I’m not in a place to preview or get into what actions we may or may not be considering. But when we talk about what we want to see for the future of Lebanon, selecting a president is, of course, at the top of that list. We want to see a president that is reflective of the will of the Lebanese people; we want to see a government that is free from the stranglehold of Hizballah.', 'Said, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you, Vedant.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: Now Vedant, from this podium we heard some time back that if Sinwar was to depart the scene the war would end. I remember things akin to it will end tomorrow, and so on. But what we have seen —', 'MR PATEL: I don’t think we’ve ever –', 'QUESTION: Okay.', 'MR PATEL: Said, I’m – so I always – I’m always happy to give you the space to ask whatever it is, whatever questions that you want to ask. But I am going to just jump in and say that no one has ever said that.', 'QUESTION: Okay. Fine.', 'MR PATEL: What we were talking about was that Mr. Sinwar had a choice to make as it relates to the ceasefire proposal that had been on the table and that he, time and time again, chose not to accept what has been on the proposal. We never said that if he were to die or be killed that that all the sudden would mean that the conflict would end.', 'What this means – and what we said on Thursday and what the Secretary stressed in his meetings with Israeli counterparts today – is that this is a new opportunity. His death is a new opportunity to reinvigorate that conversation and work to get a ceasefire proposal, one that allows an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza, one that brings the remaining hostages home, including the seven Americans, and get us on a path to diplomacy that we hope will help get this region out of the endless cycles of violence. That’s what this is about.', 'QUESTION: Fair enough. Now what we have seen since Sinwar’s death is really an intensification of this assault. As a matter of fact, it probably surpasses other times. Israel has always greeted American officials, Secretary Blinken, with increased assaults on Palestinians and so on. But we have seen really, I mean, a spike in killing dozens, hundreds of Palestinians since last Thursday when they announced the killing of Sinwar, even with some people calling for resettlement in Gaza and so on. So my question to you: Is Israel committing the so-called generals’ plan that aims to depopulate Gaza and resettle it by Israeli settlers?', 'MR PATEL: What I can say, Said, is that, first, the rhetoric that you’re referring to about resettling Gaza or however it was phrased, we certainly – that’s the kind of rhetoric that we unequivocally reject. We have been clear numerous times that what we are working towards and what we want to see is Palestinian-led governance in Gaza and a Gaza that is unified with the West Bank under what we hope is a revitalized Palestinian Authority.', 'The Secretary was clear about this in the immediate months after October 7th in a speech that he made in Tokyo that fall, where he laid out that there can be no long-term displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. We don’t want to see any territorial reduction in Gaza, and we certainly don’t want to see any reoccupation of Gaza after this crisis ends. What we want to work on and what we want to see are affirmative elements that will get us to a sustained peace. And that in our view needs to include the Palestinians people’s voices, their aspirations, and that needs to be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza. The United States would not and will not support anything less than that.', 'QUESTION: Okay, all right. I also appreciate every time you call on me. I love it and thank you. I wanted to ask you about Palestinians have been accusing the Israeli military of using detainees as human shields in Gaza. I wonder if you are aware of this report and if you are doing anything about it, about investigating this issue.', 'MR PATEL: So we’ve spoken to this a little bit before, Said. These reports are incredibly disturbing. And if they are true, they are completely unacceptable. We’re still gathering information. But as we have said before, civilians need to be protected and Israel has a responsibility to investigate credible allegations of violations whenever they arise.', 'QUESTION: And how will you determine if its true or not?', 'MR PATEL: We will continue to engage with our partners in Israel on this, Said. Of course, as you – we’ve talked about before, the United States does not have boots on the ground in Gaza. We will continue to assess these through the limited means that we have. But the ultimate thing here is that we want to see Israel appropriately investigate credible allegations or violations whenever they arise. We have, of course, seen them do that in certain incidents and we want to make sure that that is consistently applied to anywhere that these issues arise.', 'QUESTION: Could we have an update on the delivery of aid? From what —', 'MR PATEL: Sure, I’m happy to. I’m happy to offer some updated information on that. Look, I think first let me just say – and Jenny asked this a little bit – that this is something that the Secretary stressed and reiterated with the prime minister earlier today that we want to continue to see progress made. We are continuing to press Israel that there is a responsibility to maximize and streamline the existing crossings and open more crossings for more increased levels of aid into Gaza.', 'A hundred and fourteen trucks crossed yesterday. That included trucks from Kerem Shalom and the Erez west crossing. Certainly, I don’t say that to try and make the point that that is satisfactory or enough, but we want to continue to see a steady influx of trucks and humanitarian assistance into Gaza, Said. Especially as the region heads into the winter months, we want to make sure that appropriate foodstuffs and winterization supplies are appropriately surged.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah. Alex, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you, Vedant.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: I want to go to BRICS gathering in Kazan.', 'MR PATEL: Sure.', 'QUESTION: But before that, what do you make of the fact that UN secretary-general refused to attend Ukraine’s peace summit which is about defending the UN Charter, chose to somehow attend this Putin summit which is about defying the UN Charter?', 'MR PATEL: So Alex, I will let the secretary-general and his team speak to whatever scheduling decisions they have or have not made. I just want to be clear, though, Secretary-General Guterres I think has – the UN system in itself has been an incredible partner when we are talking about holding the Russian Federation accountable and making – in almost as unison as one can be in the UN system making it clear that there is a strong collection of countries that are standing up against Russian aggression, Russians’ territorial – its infringement on Ukrainian territorial integrity, its infringement on Ukrainian sovereignty. So let me just first address that as it relates to the secretary-general.', 'On the BRICS summit broadly, Alex, we believe all countries are sovereign countries and they have their own choice and make their own choices about the countries and groupings in which that they associate. What the United States is focused on and the approach that we bring to all of the foreign policy and the diplomacy that we conduct is that we are focused on working with partners around the world to build the broadest and deepest coalitions possible to help achieve our shared goals.', 'We want to enhance the value proposition of what the United States can bring to the table, and we want to work with countries through investments in the kinds of things that we know these kinds of countries are looking for, and we are looking to sharpen and deepen and broaden our partnerships in that way. And of course, the multilateral institutions, whether it be the UN, G20, groups – groupings like APEC or ASEAN, are, of course, important and vital avenues for us to do that, and that’s why you have seen the Secretary place an emphasis on continuing to engage with those countries.', 'And look, as it relates to the specific makeup of BRICS, we’re going to continue to work and have a strong, positive relationship with Brazil, with South Africa, with India. We work bilaterally with those countries in a number of key areas, a number of key areas that we frankly think are going to continue to define the 21st century.', 'When it comes to China, our goal and our intent is to continue to manage that relationship and manage that relationship responsibly, manage our competition with China responsibly. That is what we know that the rest of the world expects of superpowers.', 'And lastly, as it relates to Russia, we will continue to push back on Russian aggression and make clear to any country on the planet that it can no longer be business as usual with the Russian Federation.', 'QUESTION: As you know, there’s some newcomers in the room. Azerbaijan is one of them. Kazakhstan was punished for not joining. But Türkiye – Turkish president is among the participants. Does the department have any view of the NATO partner’s BRICS membership bid?', 'MR PATEL: No. This is a – this is a – this is an issue for our Turkish partners to speak to. Türkiye is an important and vital NATO Ally, and as I said at the beginning, we believe that countries are able to chart their own foreign policy and choose whatever countries and groupings in which they associate.', 'QUESTION: And final one for me, Vedant. Speaking of Türkiye, Turkish parliament today – the government has reintroduced a law called, quote/unquote, “agent of influence,” which is another copycat of Russian foreign influence law, foreign agent law. Do you have any position on it?', 'MR PATEL: I’m not very familiar with that, Alex, but I’m happy to check with the team and see if we can get something back for you.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Vedant. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has made an appeal to President Biden for the release of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, who is in U.S. prison for attempting to kill American officials in Afghanistan. How would you respond to that request?', 'MR PATEL: So first, I certainly wouldn’t get into private diplomatic communications. And on the case itself, I would refer to the Department of Justice to speak to any inquiries regarding Dr. Siddiqui’s incarceration.', 'QUESTION: Sir, police in southern Pakistan have shot at a doctor accused of blasphemy, and it’s not just killing. After he was killed, a violent mob dragged out his dead body from a car and burned it to death in front of his family. How much are you concerned about the rise of religious extremism in Pakistan?', 'MR PATEL: We uniformly oppose blasphemy laws everywhere in the world, and that, of course, includes in Pakistan. We believe that these laws jeopardize the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and the freedom of religion or belief. We regularly raise these concerns with countries around the world, including, of course, Pakistan.', 'QUESTION: Sir, last question. Media reports suggest that United States has communicated to the Indian Government that it seeks meaningful accountability regarding the alleged murder plot of a Sikh activist in New York. Could you confirm? If that kind of message was sent to India, what was their response?', 'MR PATEL: So to take a step back, there was valuable engagement with India’s inquiry committee last week, and information was exchanged between our two governments to further our respective investigations. We understand that the Indian inquiry committee will continue its investigation, and we expect to see further steps based on last week’s conversations.', 'We continue to expect and want to see accountability based on the results of that investigation, and certainly the United States won’t be fully satisfied until there is meaningful accountability resulting from that investigation. Beyond that, I’m just not going to address this in further detail given that this is an issue that is active and remains under investigation and ongoing under both of our countries.', 'Go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you very much, Vedant. Just two questions, sir. Today, this one senator resigned from Pakistan senate. He was on dialysis, and he said that while he was picked up by the powerful – usually by “the powerful” they mean the establishment, the military of Pakistan. He said while he was picked up, he was given dialysis even twice during that five, six days’ time. Do you have anything to say? Are you even aware about it?', 'MR PATEL: I’m not aware and I really don’t have anything to offer on that.', 'Jackson, go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Just one more question.', 'QUESTION: Thanks —', 'QUESTION: Just one more —', 'MR PATEL: I’m going to – you got two yesterday. Go ahead, Jackson.', 'QUESTION: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Vedant. There’s a report that Ariane Tabatabai was the leaker of the documents purporting to show Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran. Can you confirm?', 'MR PATEL: I certainly wouldn’t speak to that from here. As I said in a response to Nick’s question earlier, the FBI has announced that they are actively investigating the unauthorized disclosure, and I will ultimately defer to them to speak to that further.', 'QUESTION: Did the Secretary discuss the leaks during his visit to Israel?', 'MR PATEL: I don’t have anything else to offer as it relates to the Secretary’s engagements beyond what was in the readout.', 'Go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Yeah.', 'QUESTION: Thank you. When it comes to intel analysis, South Korea and the United States have been very in lockstep, in very close coordination, especially about North Korea’s military activities, and this time there seems to be some difference, and you said it’s not about confidence in South Korean intelligence. Then are you rejecting the notion that there is a discrepancy in intel analysis between Seoul and Washington about North Korean deployment?', 'MR PATEL: So I’m just not going to speak to the process, the intelligence processes that we have in place. Let me just be unequivocal about this: When it comes to the Indo-Pacific, when it comes to our priorities around the world, our relationship with the Republic of Korea is one of the most vital and one of our most consequential and important relationships. They are a partner in a number of key areas. Especially when it comes to our broader and ultimate goal of seeing peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific, our partners in Korea are integral to that goal.', 'Separate from that, the reporting that we have seen as it relates to soldiers from the DPRK who – the suggestion that they have been sent to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine – should that be true, that would be incredibly concerning. It would be dangerous and certainly it would be reckless. The United States has its own processes in place and our own assessments that we need to make before, certainly, we can publicly say that we are seeing anything as it relates to a particular policy area. It is not at all a reflection of any country, whether it be the ROK or otherwise. It’s not a reflection of that at all.', 'QUESTION: Any discussions underway as to what to do in terms of, like, sanctioning North Korea or any steps to take, if it’s true?', 'MR PATEL: Look, I – at the center – at the center of this, if these developments are true, they would certainly be incredibly dangerous, and that is why, at the core of this, is continuing to consult with our allies and partners, of which ROK would certainly be a part of that. But I’m not going to preview any – preview any actions we may or may not take from up here.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', 'MR PATEL: Go ahead.', 'QUESTION: Do you know how many aid trucks arrived in northern Gaza over the weekend up until today?', 'MR PATEL: I don’t have a specific breakdown for you on transit intra Gaza. What I can say is what I asked – answered to Said’s question, is that there were – and I will pull up the number again just to be precise – it was on October 21st 114 trucks that we saw enter Gaza, which, again, I’m not at all – don’t make that – offer that statistic to say that that is satisfactory, but that is the updated metric that we have. And simultaneously, we of course are stressing with partners in Israel that more needs to be done to enhance the flow of humanitarian aid.', 'QUESTION: I ask because a journalist yesterday on the ground in northern Gaza yesterday told me that an UNRWA facility in Gaza City had received seven trucks containing flour and canned goods, but which have yet to be distributed, but received no water. I don’t know what you do with flour without water, but they’re having a hard time even distributing these because of the ongoing onslaught there. So —', 'MR PATEL: So I’m just going to stop you right there. We are not at all saying that the situation has improved or that the situation is satisfactory – far from it. We have – in the immediate days following the letter that Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin sent, we saw some important steps in the right direction as it relates to particular border crossings. Those were good, positive signs. I can say that on October 21st 114 trucks made its way into Gaza. But of course, we are continuing to see challenges as it relates to ensuring that aid is getting to where it needs to go within Gaza. That’s something that we are continuing to work closely on with partners in Israel, NGO partners, and international organizations, and that’s something we’ll continue to stress.', 'All right, everyone, we’re going to wrap there. Thanks.', 'QUESTION: Thank you.', '(The briefing was concluded at 1:43 p.m.)', '# # #', 'TAGS', '', '', '', '']"

NBC News has not independently verified the date or location of the video, in which people can be heard speaking Korean.', 'In addition to providing Putin a boost on the battlefield, the involvement of North Korean troops would further strengthen his partnership with Kim, who signed a pact in Pyongyang in June that includes a pledge of mutual defense.', 'Putin didn’t deny that North Korea was sending soldiers to Russia, initially resorting to sarcasm when NBC News asked about it Thursday and saying it was up to the two countries to decide how they implement the agreement.', '“We are in contact with our North Korean friends. We’ll see how that process develops,” he said as he hosted the summit of BRICS nations in Kazan, Russia. He added that it was the U.S. and other Western countries that had escalated the war in Ukraine.', 'A North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York said Monday that reports of North Korean soldiers being sent to Russia were “groundless rumors.”', 'South Korea said Friday that it was “deeply concerned” after the mutual defense pact was ratified a day earlier by the lower house of the Russian parliament, with the upper house expected to follow shortly.', 'South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and his U.S. counterpart, Lloyd Austin, are set to hold their annual meeting next week in Washington. South Korean officials said Friday that the two men will discuss how the North Korean deployment might affect the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.', 'Tensions there have been rising as North Korea, which remains technically at war with the South, continues to advance its weapons programs and issue threats.', 'The U.S. and other countries say Moscow may be providing Pyongyang with key military technology for those programs in exchange for munitions it needs in Ukraine, including millions of artillery shells. Both North Korea and Russia deny any transfer of arms. ', 'But experts say the arrangement could leave Moscow even more beholden to Pyongyang, and perhaps more willing to share the technologies and expertise that North Korea most covets.', 'The entry of North Korean troops into the Ukraine war could also lead to even further escalation of the conflict.', 'South Korea is now considering upgrading its support for Ukraine from non-lethal aid to defensive and perhaps even offensive weapons. The government of Japan, another U.S. ally that is directly threatened by North Korea’s weapons programs, said Friday that it was monitoring the situation “with grave concern.”', 'China, which borders both North Korea and Russia and has been growing closer with both as it seeks to challenge the U.S.-led international order, has its own reasons to be concerned. ', 'It has strived to portray itself as neutral in the Ukraine war, putting forward a peace plan that Ukraine, the U.S. and others say is too favorable to Russia. But China has supported Russia diplomatically and economically, and the U.S. accuses it of supplying Russia with dual-use technology, which it denies.', 'Beijing has not been especially happy with either the recent behavior of North Korea or the direction of the war in Ukraine, Bremmer said.', 'He noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an end to the Ukraine war in a speech this week at the BRICS summit.', '“I think that the North Korea move is a big part of that, frankly,” Bremmer said.', 'Asked Thursday about the reported North Korean deployment, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Beijing was not aware of the situation.', '“China’s position on the Ukraine crisis has been consistent and clear, and it hopes that all parties will work towards de-escalating the situation and remain committed to a political solution,” the spokesperson, Lin Jian, said at a regular briefing in Beijing.', 'Bremmer, who met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior Chinese leaders while in Beijing last week, said he got the sense they were “clearly uncomfortable” with the Russia relationship and the course of the war in Ukraine, which began weeks after Xi and Putin declared a “no limits” partnership in Beijing in February 2022.', '“They were saying things like, ‘Well, the Kremlin told us that this was going to be done in a few weeks,’ and it isn’t,” Bremmer said. “So in other words, they kind of sold them a bill of goods.”', 'Though the Chinese government has so far appeared largely unwilling to use its influence over Russia in Ukraine, Bremmer said it was now actively considering “taking a more assertive stance, maybe after the elections being more willing to work with the Americans and others to try to bring the war to an end.”', 'Jennifer Jett is the Asia Digital Editor for NBC News, based in Hong Kong.', '© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

And Washington has few if any options to completely stop it, officials privately concede.', 'White House Spokesperson JOHN KIRBY called the reports of 1,500 North Korean troops being deployed to Russia “dangerous and highly concerning” but said it also underscored how Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN was “increasingly desperate” to turn the tide of his costly war in Ukraine.', 'Privately, U.S. officials as well as East Asian diplomats and congressional aides say there’s little Washington can do practically to stymy the blossoming alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang in conversations with NatSec Daily, short of direct military action which isn’t on the table. These three officials and two aides were granted anonymity to discuss the matter candidly.', 'They concede that Washington has made little to no progress in slowing North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and if it can’t do that, it can only do so much to halt North Korean troop deployments to Russia, too.', 'For starters, the go-to U.S. retaliation against its adversaries — adding countries to sanctions and export controls lists — doesn’t work on North Korea the way it does other countries. “It is already sanctioned to the hilt, more sanctions can’t really do much,” said one U.S. official.', 'Second, North Korea has effectively been ghosting President JOE BIDEN ever since he first came into office nearly four years ago, leaving no starting point for any dialogue on this issue in the first place. The White House has repeatedly extended public offers to talk to North Korea, also known as the DPRK, any time with “no preconditions” but has only received radio silence from North Korean leader KIM JONG UN in return.', 'Third, officials said, Moscow’s recently renewed embrace of Pyongyang gives the isolated North Korean regime a new diplomatic lifeline to the outside world that is impervious to Western or international pressure. Putin has shown no willingness to halt or alter r enewed defense and security cooperation with North Korea despite waves of international condemnation, going so far as to veto a U.N. sanctions monitoring program on North Korea it had previously supported earlier this year.', 'Still, the United States is trying. It has worked to strengthen its alliance structures in East Asia and strengthen its defense cooperation with South Korea and Japan in a show of force to North Korea and its backers in Beijing and Moscow. And the U.S. has boosted cooperation among its allies in Asia and those in Europe — a development all sides are welcoming. NATO has requested that South Korea send a delegation to Brussels to brief the alliance on the reports of North Korean troops in Russia, as our own STUART LAU reports.', '“We are looking into the reports that the DPRK is preparing to send soldiers to fight alongside Russia. We are consulting with our allies and partners on the implications of such a dramatic move,” said Lt. Cmdr JAVAN RASNAKE, a Department of Defense spokesperson. The National Security Council told NatSec Daily it is reviewing policy options if the reports prove correct, but did not elaborate.', 'One major unknown that has unnerved some U.S. officials is what exactly the North Korean troops will be doing in Russia. Ukrainian officials have said that the North Korean troops could begin directly fighting against their forces in Ukraine. Some U.S. officials and congressional aides speculate that these North Korean forces could gain warfighting training and technical know-how on Western defense systems from the battle-hardened Russian forces to take back to their own country.', '“There are a lot of unknowns about what they’ll do, but all the options are bad,” said a congressional aide who works on Asian security issues.', 'A message from Lockheed Martin:', 'Capabilities from Every Angle.

But they’re not betraying much about how the leak happened.', 'Kirby told reporters that while there is no expectation that further leaks will occur, the U.S. government is “not exactly sure how these documents found their way into the public domain.” Kirby added that the U.S. has spoken to Israel over the disclosure of the documents, which made the rounds on pro-Iranian social media accounts and channels over the weekend.', 'The leak is an embarrassing blow for the administration and follows another high-profile breach last year when classified documents around the war in Ukraine were released on popular gaming platform Discord by an Air National Guard member. It also seems poised to further wrinkle the U.S.-Israel relationship as Israel proceeds on with its pledged response against Iran for the attack earlier this month.', 'BLINKEN BLASTS OFF AGAIN: Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN is making a trip to the Middle East following the death of Hamas leader YAHYA SINWAR.', 'State Department spokesperson MATT MILLER said in a statement this morning that Blinken will be in the region through Oct. 25, making visits to Israel and “other countries in the Middle East.” The visit, said Miller, will focus on “the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people” and “the need to reach a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hizballah.” Biden had said Blinken would visit the region last week during his trip to Berlin.', 'He’s not the only official in the region — Kirby confirmed that special envoy AMOS HOCHSTEIN is in Beirut today, meeting with regional stakeholders “to see what could be in the realm of the possible, in terms of trying to find meaningful cease-fire between those two sides.”', 'Both trips come as Israel continues its offensive in the Gaza Strip, and follow its pledge over the weekend to strike hard against Hezbollah’s leaders and network in Lebanon.', 'MOLDOVA’S MOMENT: Brussels and Washington are letting out sighs of relief this morning after po-European Moldovan President MAIA SANDU survived to a runoff against a Russian-backed candidate and a referendum to advance the country’s integration with the European Union eked out a narrow victory in Sunday’s elections.', 'The results are closer than Sandu’s allies in the West likely would have wanted. But as we wrote on Friday, Moldova was facing intense election meddling from the Kremlin, as Moscow sought to back pro-Russian proxy parties and pro-Putin oligarchs even tried to bribe voters to oppose the referendum. And the U.S. was taking several steps to combat Kremlin election interference, as our own MAGGIE MILLER reported Saturday.', 'Reacting to the results, Kirby said today that “we will continue to stand with them as they endeavor to continue to protect their democracy and, quite frankly, to reach the aspirations of the Moldovan people.”', 'The result will also be a morale boost for opposition parties in Georgia, where parliamentary elections are coming up on Saturday.

Following those reports, the company exited dozens of non-democratic countries, conducted a corporate restructure and brought in human rights experts permanently to its leadership team. And last month, Sandvine pledged it was undertaking a new chapter as a “technology solution leader for democracies.”', 'AUSTIN IN KYIV: Defense Secretary LLOYD AUSTIN made a surprise trip to Ukraine today, unveiling a major tranche of new military aid to Kyiv as Ukraine continues to rally support for its victory plan.', 'As Paul reports, the U.S. will give Kyiv $400 million in new military aid out of the $5 billion left in the U.S. military aid account for Ukraine. But Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY faces enormous pressure as his country continues to lose territory at the front and his victory plan received lukewarm reception in Europe and the United States.', 'And Ukrainians and their allies are still disappointed in the degree of support Washington and European capitals are providing Kyiv. At a press roundtable, Ukrainian Nobel Prize Laureate OLEKSANDRA MATVIICHUK and former Supreme Allied Commander Gen. PHILIP BREEDLOVE urged the West to step up its aid to Kyiv, framing a Ukrainian victory as a key test for global democracy.', '“Ukraine is a tool for Russia to break this international order,” said Matviichuk. “Putin will stop only when he will be stopped, and if authoritarian countries support each other, democracies must demonstrate unity in supporting freedom and democratic values.”', 'FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY — SECURING UNDERSEA CABLES: A bipartisan group of senators is urging the White House to better protect undersea cables from potential Russian and Chinese sabotage.', 'In a letter shared first with NatSec Daily, the Democrats and Republicans, led by Sens.
