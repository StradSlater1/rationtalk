Monitoring Respiratory Illnesses Informs Decision Making,https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/monitoring-respiratory-illnesses-informs-decision-making.html,"['', '', ""It's fall and winter virus season, so it's time to get your recommended immunizations, one of the core strategies in CDC's respiratory virus guidance. Layering on other strategies, like meeting outdoors or wearing a mask, may depend on virus activity in your area. To help you make informed decisions, CDC shares timely data on respiratory illnesses."", ""CDC collects a variety of respiratory illness data and has taken steps to clearly show trends in disease activity and illness severity. Check out CDC's updated Respiratory Illness Data Channel for the latest information on trends in flu, COVID-19, and RSV, as well as overall respiratory illnesses."", ""October is here, which means we're now in the fall and winter virus season. While respiratory illnesses are present throughout the year, the fall and winter months are a time when we need to be extra aware of what viruses are spreading and who is impacted the most. CDC uses data from different sources to answer important questions regarding respiratory illness activity and severity. This can help you make informed decisions to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community. You can find a summary of this information on the Respiratory Illness Data Channel every week."", 'Respiratory illnesses include many conditions, including viral diseases such as flu, COVID-19, and RSV, as well as bacterial and fungal diseases, like some types of pneumonia. A common question CDC gets is: ""If you aren\'t counting every case of a respiratory disease, like COVID-19, how do you know how bad things are?"" Collecting information about cases is an important tool that public health uses to identify and monitor certain diseases, including those designated as being nationally notifiable. However, it isn\'t always the most useful or efficient approach to help guide public health action. This is especially true when the disease is common and not always diagnosed or reported.', 'Fortunately, public health agencies have many ways to gauge the threat respiratory diseases pose to communities across the nation. CDC uses multiple data systems and tools to detect and track respiratory illness activity, monitor disease severity, and forecast expected trends. These systems are used for overall, ongoing respiratory illness situational awareness and can be adapted for specific disease types or emergency public health responses if needed. Sometimes disease trends in these systems differ or appear to differ. When trying to interpret these differences, it is helpful to know how the systems work, what they monitor, and what important public health questions they can answer.', 'CDC currently uses three main types of data systems to track respiratory virus and disease activity.', ""CDC has multiple systems, such as the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System, that collect laboratory testing results from clinical, public health, and commercial laboratories. Each system represents different subsets of the population. Monitoring the total number of positive tests is not as useful because how people are tested can change. Instead, we monitor the percentage of tests that are positive instead of focusing on total numbers. This measure provides an early indicator of increases in infections, as well as an effective signal for when we've passed a seasonal peak. It is important to note that some laboratory monitoring systems focus primarily on identifying new or different subtypes or variants of viruses that cause flu and COVID-19 rather than focusing on test positivity."", 'CDC relies on data from a robust network of emergency departments covering about 81% of emergency departments in the United States. This system helps us monitor changes in demand for medical services based on information collected during emergency department visits. These data provide public health agencies insight into the burden of diseases, including respiratory illnesses. CDC analyzes de-identified information, which is stripped of any personal details, on both patients\' ""chief complaints"" (in response to questions like, ""Why did you come in today?"") and their specific diagnoses. This dual approach helps us track conditions with a diagnosis, like COVID-19, and those that might not have a pathogen-specific diagnosis, such as shortness of breath. Emergency department visits with a diagnosis currently underlie CDC\'s Respiratory Illnesses Data Channel, including the newly added acute respiratory illness metric, or ARI.', 'As of October 4, 2024, the ARI metric is available as a snapshot of the amount of overall respiratory illness requiring care at an emergency department at the state and national levels. Instead of focusing on specific diseases, like COVID-19, the ARI metric is based on a wide range of respiratory illness diagnoses and chief complaints from emergency department visits. At times, increases in this metric may be driven primarily by specific diseases like flu or COVID-19. Sometimes these increases can be due to a wide range of illnesses such as:', 'Wastewater surveillance tests for genetic traces of viruses, including those that cause flu, COVID-19, and RSV, in sewer systems. These sewer systems currently cover about 40% of the U.S. population. Wastewater data can provide early indication of disease spread and provide information on overall virus levels, not just infection in people who seek medical care. These data can be a bit ""noisier"" (prone to irregularities that can make trends less clear) than emergency department data. This is especially so at the state or local levels, so use caution when interpreting week-to-week changes. Also, wastewater data are unable to determine the source of detected viruses, such as whether they come from humans, animals, or animal products. This can be important to understand when monitoring and responding to some viruses, such as bird flu. Wastewater testing is one of CDC\'s newest tools and we\'re still learning how to use it best in each situation.', 'Knowing how many people have respiratory illnesses and the viruses causing those illnesses is just a part of the picture. We also need to know how severe these illnesses are. To track disease severity, CDC uses multiple types of hospital-based systems and our National Vital Statistics System.', 'From 2020 through earlier this year, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) tracked nearly every U.S. hospitalization in a person with a laboratory test positive for flu or COVID-19. This provided a comprehensive picture of cases severe enough to require hospitalization. These data played a critical role in guiding facility, health system, and community-level actions to protect patients and public health. Although reporting became voluntary in April 2024, new rules will require hospitals to start reporting again in November 2024. These rules also expand reporting to include RSV. In addition to tracking hospitalizations, hospitals will also report data on overall hospital capacity, such as the number of beds currently being used by patients. This helps identify signals of healthcare strain and identify resource needs during peak respiratory season and emerging public health events.', 'The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) collects data on laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations with flu, COVID-19, or RSV at all acute-care hospitals within designated sites across the country. About 8–10% of the U.S. population is covered through this surveillance network. RESP-NET collects detailed information about hospitalizations occurring in a smaller geographic area to monitor trends by important demographic characteristics and answer in-depth public health questions, such as identifying important risk factors for severe health outcomes.', 'CDC also has access to a collection of near real-time healthcare data sources. These data sources allow us to understand clinical risk factors leading to a hospitalization, describe the care received and associated outcomes during a hospitalization, and monitor long-term clinical needs and outcomes after discharge.', ""CDC's National Vital Statistics System captures information from death certificates. CDC releases provisional death data every week, helping monitor trends in respiratory illness-associated deaths. Provisional data is early information that is available right now but might change as more reports come in. These data help CDC track the percent of total deaths attributed to respiratory illnesses so we can spot concerning trends."", 'While looking at current and past data is critical, CDC also uses tools to understand what is likely to happen in the future. This includes:', 'This tool examines data on emergency department visits to estimate whether infections are currently increasing or decreasing in the state. Changes in infection trends precede similar trends in more severe outcomes, such as hospitalizations and deaths, and therefore give an indication of where the epidemic is headed.', 'These are not yet available for this season but will soon be introduced to project expected hospitalizations up to four weeks ahead for flu and COVID-19. They rely on the data reported into NHSN.', 'This outlook provides a broad assessment for the upcoming season to assist in public health preparedness. For this season, the experts predict that the combined peak hospitalizations for number of flu, COVID-19, and RSV hospitalizations will be similar to, or slightly lower than last season.', ""CDC has a long history of monitoring respiratory illness, and these capabilities have continued to grow since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this new growth, including the expansion of emergency department and wastewater monitoring, is thanks to efforts like CDC's Data Modernization Initiative and ongoing focus on the Public Health Data Strategy milestones."", 'Each of our data systems helps tell a different part of the story about circulating viruses and who is getting sick. Many different teams of CDC experts interpret the data from across these systems. They work together to integrate the information into meaningful key findings that are shared with the public in places like FluView and the Respiratory Illnesses Data Channel. The Respiratory Illness Data Channel:', 'CDC experts engage with colleagues across state and local health departments. This cooperation ensures that local context is considered when interpreting and responding to data trends.', 'CDC continues to work to improve how we and our partners collect, use, and share respiratory illness information. Our goal is to help individuals, hospitals, healthcare systems, and communities make informed decisions to protect health and improve lives.', ""Information on NCIRD's mission, work, and organizational structure."", '', '']"

The age at which you’re invited for different vaccines varies and they are, of course, all optional. ', 'Manchester-based GP partner Helen Wall told Saga Magazine that it’s important to take up vaccines if you’re offered them.', '“We think that as you get older, your immune system becomes less able to respond to attack, so you could come into contact with something that can make you feel quite poorly,” says Dr Wall.', '“The JCVI are constantly looking at the data, what the virulent strains are and who’s going into hospital and they tell the NHS who should be eligible for the latest vaccines.” ', 'You might be offered the flu and Covid vaccine at the same appointment, and that’s perfectly safe. They’re usually given in different arms.', 'There aren’t any combined jabs that target different seasonal viruses in the same injection.', '“If you’ve got a cold or are on antibiotics it’s fine to go ahead, but if you have a fever, it’s recommended you delay your vaccine. It’s not that it’s dangerous, but a fever is a sign your immune system is dealing with something already, so it could be the vaccine won’t work as effectively so it’s best to wait,” says Dr Wall. ', 'If you’re over 65 – or will be by 31 March 2025 – you can get the free NHS flu vaccine. The adult flu jab is also available for people with certain long-term health conditions, those who live in a care home, carers, and health and care workers.  ', 'Last year, over-50s in Scotland were also eligible, as well as teachers, but this is no longer the case – eligibility for the jab is now very similar across the UK. ', 'If you have questions about the flu vaccine, you’re not alone.', '“People say: ‘I’ve had the flu vaccine every year for the last 20 years – why do I need another one?’ But you don’t know which flu strains you’ve been vaccinated against, which is why you’ll need it this year,” says Dr Wall.', '“If you have had flu earlier on in the year, it might not be a strain that’s likely to come this winter. The vaccine is formulated to be applicable to what our winter flu season will look like.” ', 'People also want to know if the flu jab will give them flu, but the answer is no. “There’s no live flu in the injectable version, therefore it’s absolutely impossible for it to give you flu,” says Dr Wall.', 'There are several ways to check if you’re eligible and book: ', 'If you’re not eligible for a free flu vaccine, some pharmacies are offering it privately. Boots is offering it for £21.95 (£26.95 in Jersey), Superdrug has it for £19.95 (or £9.95 if you have a Health & Beautycard – which is free to get) and it’s £16 at Tesco Pharmacy. ', ""You’ll be eligible for a Covid vaccine – an “autumn booster” – if you’re 65 or over. You’re also eligible if you’re a frontline NHS or care worker, or live in a care home for older adults, or are at increased risk of getting seriously ill with the virus, for example if you have a serious lung condition, a heart problem or a weakened immune system, for example if you're having chemotherapy. "", 'Even if you’ve had Covid before, it can still cause an unpleasant illness. Getting vaccinated also reduces the chances that you’ll pass it on to other people.

With that in mind, our expert says that the question of whether it's worth paying for depends how concerned you are and whether you can afford it."", '“If you’re outside the eligible group but worried about Covid, you can get the vaccine privately, but it comes down to your level of concern,” says Dr Wall. “If you’ve had Covid badly before and you can afford the vaccine, I’d support that, but I don’t think people who aren’t eligible should be worried.” ', 'You can book an appointment online or in the NHS app or find a walk-in vaccination centre in England.

You’ll also be offered it if you turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023 (if you turned 65 before that you’ll have to wait until you’re 70). ', 'Two doses are given, between six and 12 months apart. You won’t need the shingles vaccine again after that. Although you won’t be eligible if you’re in your 80s or 90s, it’s likely you’ve already been offered the vaccine, as it’s been used in the UK since 2013. ', '“Shingles is the same virus as chickenpox, so it stays dormant in our system,” explains Dr Wall. “If you’re stressed, run down or have other illnesses the virus can resurface as shingles. It makes you feel tired and unwell, but generally fit people can get back on their feet. ', '“But if you’re a bit older or immunocompromised, it can lead to complications such as pneumonia, blindness and deafness. You’re also more prone to get postherpetic neuralgia, which is an overactivation of the nerves which gives you constant pain where you had shingles.” ', 'Speak to your GP surgery to book an appointment if you’re in the eligible age group. ', 'If you’re over 50 but not eligible for the NHS vaccine, you can also pay privately from Boots, Superdrug and private clinics. It’s not cheap, though, at over £400 for the two doses you’ll need.', 'It’s offered on the NHS to those most at risk of complications, so if you’re not eligible on the NHS but are eligible to pay privately (most likely because you’re over 50 but under 65), it’s down to you whether you feel it’s a good investment.  ', 'This year, the NHS is offering the RSV vaccine to people aged between 75 and 79. If you turned 80 since 1 September, you’re also eligible until 31 August 2025, but the RSV vaccine is not available for those over 80. ', 'At the moment, it’s a one-off vaccine. “Because most people have had RSV at least once in their lives, this is likely to be a boost to their protection on top of their natural immunity,” says Dr Wall.', 'In most people, the RSV causes a cough, cold and sore throat, but it can lead to more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia, and this is more likely if you’re older. It’s estimated to cause nearly 8,000 deaths a year in over-65s in the UK.', 'Since we published our article about the RSV vaccine, some readers have expressed concern about it being a new vaccine.

CDC recommends whooping cough vaccination for everyone, including pregnant women.There are 2 types of combination vaccines that include protection against whooping cough, DTaP or Tdap based on what other vaccine it is combined with - either tetanus or diphtheria. ', 'The virus is highly contagious, especially in its early stages, when the only symptoms of that of your typical cold: runny rose, low-grade fever and a mild occasional cough. As whooping cough progresses patients can experience fits of numerous and rapid coughing, vomiting and exhaustion. These symptoms can last 6 to 10 weeks.', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus or RSV has also seen a surge in the last few seasons. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalizations for infants under a year old in the United States each year.  RSV is a common virus that typically produces cold-like symptoms, but it can be especially dangerous for the very young, elderly and those with compromised immune systems. ', 'Last year, RSV cases filled US hospitals, urgent cares and doctors’ offices from early fall into the winter, with symptoms including wheezing and difficulty breathing. ', 'Earlier this year FDA has approved an RSV antibody, nirsevimab, to protect infants. The Food and Drug Administration approved the injection for infants and children up to two years old who face increased risk of severe RSV. It is a laboratory made version of the antibody that helps the immune system fight off RSV. There is currently no RSV vaccine for children, but several companies are looking into one.', 'The RSV antibody is given by a single injection to babies, including preterm infants, to protect against their first RSV season. Children up to age two can receive another dose during their second RSV season. There is also an RSV antibody available for pregnant women to help protect their children immediately after birth.', 'Additionally, there are three RSV vaccine options for seniors, another group vulnerable to RSV. RSV can cause a range of illnesses in seniors, from mild cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In some cases, it can even be fatal. Vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of developing serious complications from RSV. The CDC recommends that all adults ages 75 and older and those ages 60 to 74 who have risk factors for severe RSV disease, such as chronic heart or lung disease, a weakened immune system, other medical conditions such as diabetes, and/or live in a nursing home, get one of the three RSV vaccines. ', 'Influenza ', 'Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious virus that spreads typically between October and May. Anyone can get the flu, but it is more dangerous for some people. Infants and young children, people 65 years and older, pregnant people, and people with certain health conditions or a weakened immune system are at greatest risk of flu complications. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. If you have a medical condition, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes, flu can make it worse. ', 'Last year, 34 million people were infected with influenza in the United States. Vaccines both reduce the risk of infection with the flu and dull the severity of symptoms if you contract the virus. Even if you are not in an at risk group for severe flu, getting a flu vaccine reduces the risk of infecting loved ones who are at risk. Everyone older than six months is eligible for a flu shot. ', 'COVID', 'New variants of covid mean the virus is still circulating, although in most instances cases are less severe there are still cases of severe illness from COVID. Everyone 6 months or older is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine and encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing you from getting sick and limiting severity of symptoms if you do come down with COVID. ', 'Measles', 'Measles is another highly contagious, serious airborne virus that is impacted by waning vaccine rates. Measles can cause severe complications and even death. ', 'In recent years, there have been isolated outbreaks of measles, usually in communities where children have not been vaccinated.  The CDC recommends that children should routinely get two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, as well as mumps and rubella. First dose is administered between 12 and 15 months. Second dose at age 4 through 6 years old, before entering school.', 'Nationwide, vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten decreased to less than 93% during the 2023–24 school year, remaining below the Healthy People 2030 MMR target of 95% (3) for the fourth consecutive year. ', 'The measles vaccine is safe and effective. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles, and one dose is about 93% effective.

These include practicing good hand hygiene, disinfecting surfaces in your home, avoiding contact with people that are sick, resting and eating a healthy diet to boost your immunity.

While it is ideal for people to get vaccinated by the end of October, vaccination later in the season can still be beneficial if viruses are still circulating. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended people 65 years and older and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive a second dose of 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine six months after their first dose based on patient risk of severe disease, vaccine effectiveness data, and circulation of the virus year-round.', 'Given that RSV can be dangerous for older adults, the AMA encourages all adults ages 75 and older to get vaccinated against RSV, as well as adults ages 60–74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV, particularly those who have certain medical conditions, are frail, or live in a nursing home. The RSV vaccine is not an annual vaccine, so those who have already received an RSV vaccine do not need another dose. Immunizations are also available to protect babies from getting very sick from RSV as the virus can be dangerous for infants. Families should familiarize themselves with the options to protect infants during RSV season, including vaccination during pregnancy or an RSV monoclonal antibody for infants and young children.

We strongly urge everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV as soon as possible before the viruses begin spreading in your community.” ', 'Vaccination continues to be the best way to protect against the flu, COVID-19 and RSV and their potentially serious complications. It is also important for everyone to take public health precautions, such as covering coughs and sneezes, frequently washing your hands, wearing masks, improving air quality, and staying home if you are sick, to help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.
