The coughing episodes could last for weeks or even months.  Babies under six months old are most at-risk for whooping cough. \n\nSymptoms for that age group include coughing and difficulty breathing, which can be life-threatening.  \n\nAs for prevention, Dr. Dumford said vaccination really is key. \n\n“The one group with vaccination that we really need to focus on is pregnant patients. So the average patient, their recommendation is going to be to get your Tdap vaccine every ten years,” he said. “However, because infants are at such high risk in those first six months of life, it’s recommended that anybody who is pregnant get that pertussis vaccine, in the form of Tdap, with every pregnancy.”\n\nThere are antibiotics available for whooping cough, but they only help with preventing further spread. \n\nCoughing fits have to be treated separately with other home remedies.

We have different age groups that we vaccinate. And really we try to get everybody. Pregnant women, we absolutely vaccinate with every pregnancy. Children, they get the vaccine as well. And adults. People, when we get older, we tend to forget about vaccinating ourselves. We think about vaccinating children at all the different ages. You know, the two months, four months, six months, one year. We remember all that as parents, but we forget about ourselves and we can become those vectors that transmit diseases when we're not vaccinated and our immunity is not high enough. "", ""Counting on herd immunity. This is a concept that if everybody is vaccinated, the disease isn't going to be in the population, because it can't get a foothold.

But after a week, people with whooping cough can develop rapid, violent and uncontrolled coughing fits. ', 'The most important takeaway is that not becoming infected and not infecting others is possible as whooping cough is a vaccinable infection. CDC recommends whooping cough vaccination for babies, children, preteens, pregnant women, and adults.   ', 'Babies receive the initial vaccination in a series of shots over time. But the older a person gets, the more the immunity fades, typically most notable in teenagers and young adults. ', 'There are two types of combination vaccines that protect against whooping cough: DTaP and Tdap. Babies and children younger than 7 years old receive DTaP, while older children and adults receive Tdap.

Teens who didn’t get Tdap as a preteen can get one shot the next time they visit their healthcare provider. ', 'All adults who have never received one are advised to get a Tdap shot.
