"Buffalo Bills rout Seahawks on road, take commanding lead in AFC East (encouraged/worried)",https://www.newyorkupstate.com/buffalo-bills/2024/10/buffalo-bills-blowout-seahawks-on-road-take-commanding-lead-in-afc-east-encouragedworried.html,"['The Buffalo Bills have a commanding lead in the AFC East following Week 8.', 'There is still plenty of football left to be played and anything can happen as we’ve seen league wide, but the Bills sit at 6-2 following their 31-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks. In addition to the Bills handling their business on the road, the team saw the Miami Dolphins lose on a last-second field goal to the Arizona Cardinals and the New York Jets lose to the New England Patriots. As it stands, the Dolphins, Patriots and Jets all have two wins after Week 8.', 'Following their dominating win over Seattle, here are reasons to be encouraged and worried about Buffaalo.', 'Keon Coleman: The rookie just keeps getting better. Coleman got the Bills on the board with a one-handed grab in the end zone against Riq Woolen, the Seahawks’ top cornerback. In addition to the touchdown grab, Coleman added a few other big grabs in the win and drew a pass interference penalty down the field on Woolen. He finished with 70 yards and one touchdown on five receptions.', 'In addition to hauling in some impressive grabs, Coleman also made some excellent blocks as well. The rookie’s game is all coming together.', 'Khalil Shakir: Shakir is emerging as one of the NFL’s elite slot receivers. Shakir took short pass after short pass for big gains throughout the game and showed the ability to get open down the field as well. Allen’s favorite target finished with nine receptions for 107 yards.', 'Josh Allen: Allen threw his first interception of the season and had what could have been a costly fumble deep in their own end, but overall he was efficient with the ball in sloppy conditions. Allen would go on to complete 24-of-34 passes for 283 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. He added another 25 yards on the ground. Allen’s first interception came due to Amari Cooper slipping on his route so he continues to be smart with his passes.', 'Allen deserves to be in the MVP discussion through eight weeks.', 'James Cook: Cook averaged 6.5 yards per carry in Buffalo’s lopsided win. The back rushed for 111 yards and two scores on 17 carries. He also hauled in all three of his targets for 22 yards.', 'Greg Rousseau: Buffalo’s edge rusher is on a heater. Rousseau was dominant on Sunday with multiple pressures, one quarterback hit, two passes defensed and two tackles for loss. If Rousseau can continue to do this against better tackles, he will be in line for a massive extension.', 'Austin Johnson: Austin Johnson had his first career interception on Sunday. According to the broadcast, Johnson told Buffalo’s PR staff that he never had a interception in college, high school or even youth football. That changed with a big man INT in Buffalo’s win. Geno Smith had pressure in his face as he attempted to throw a screen. Veteran Casey Toohill got his hand on the ball and Johnson came down with the pick.', 'Bills run defense: The Seahawks have a great 1-2 punch with Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet, but you never would have known it based on how well Buffalo’s defense played against the backs. Seattle’s backs finished with 16 yards and one touchdown on 12 carries (1.33 YPC).', 'Penalties: Penalties continue to be an issue for Buffalo. The team was able to work their way out of a few of the situations, but the team will not always be able to do this on a weekly basis. In the win, Buffalo was penalized 13 times for 85 yards.', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Winners and Losers from Bills 31, Seahawks 10",https://www.fieldgulls.com/2024/10/27/24281352/2024-nfl-season-week-8-score-winners-and-losers-bills-31-seahawks-10,"['FILED UNDER:', 'The Seahawks were incompetent from start to finish in a critical home game.', 'I expected a loss against the Atlanta Falcons and feared the Seattle Seahawks defense would give up a ton of points. Seattle comfortably won in the best result of the Mike Macdonald era.', 'Then this game happened. It’s the worst performance of the Macdonald era and one of the most inept Seahawks showings I’ve seen in years. The Buffalo Bills made a ton of self-inflicted mistakes and were able to get touchdowns. The Seahawks made a ton of self-inflicted mistakes and cost themselves points, turned it over twice, and repeatedly punted.', 'Winners and Losers time from Bills 31, Seahawks 10.', 'DK Metcalf', 'If you want a contract extension from your current team, you show them the tape/film from this game. Just within the TV copy, you can tell that the Bills were content to drop seven or eight back and play coverage because there wasn’t a single receiver on the Seahawks worth respecting further than 10-15 yards down the field.', 'As I already wrote, Metcalf proved how valuable he is to this team without playing. Want to know why it seems like they’re “force-feeding DK”? You just watched it. That’s not even isolated to this game. Without Metcalf, the rest of the operation falls apart.', 'AJ Barner', 'This is a “long-term winner” thing more than anything. He had 2 catches for 34 yards, and he continues to be remarkably efficient at turning his receptions into first downs. I didn’t think he’d be much as a receiving tight end, but I’ve been proven wrong. Barner might end up being one of the better picks in this Seahawks draft class.', 'Josh Jobe', 'Actually, Jobe was terrible. But what do you expect from a practice squad cornerback? He’s a winner because he did make one good play, recording his first career interception and becoming the first to intercept Josh Allen this year. A shame Seattle wasted it.', 'Michael Dickson', 'He’s still a good punter and he ripped multiple 60-yarders, including a couple that pinned the Bills inside their 20.', 'Connor Williams', 'That was one of the worst games from a center I’ve seen in awhile. He’s been prone to wayward snaps throughout this season and in his prior seasons with the Miami Dolphins, but he may have directly cost the Seahawks two touchdowns today. His snap miles over Geno’s head turned a TD drive into a field goal, and then there’s the 4th and goal trip that killed the game as a contest. Even if that’s bad luck more than anything, Williams gave up multiple pressures and had some other questionable snaps.', 'Run Defense', 'Did nothing, as usual. The Bills didn’t have a single play that lost yards outside of kneeldowns. Another 164 yards given up, including 111 to James Cook, who was breaking through tackles in the second level and getting gaping holes to run through behind an offensive line that has zero first-round picks in its starting lineup.', 'Mike Macdonald’s group cannot stop the run, just like Pete Carroll’s group couldn’t stop the run. And when the Seahawks are trailing in games, those problems get exacerbated.', 'Offensive Line, Run Blocking', 'They’re awful at it. The Seahawks pass pro generally held up but that’s not saying much when the Bills were very content to sit back in coverage. This is a horrendous run-blocking unit that’s now trending dangerously to the 2017 mess when Luke Joeckel was getting $7 million to be a starting left guard.', 'At least previous bad OLs of yesteryear could run block to some degree. This group can’t even do that consistently.', 'Defensive Line', 'No sacks, no QB hits, and no tackles for loss. If you could excuse some of the lack of QB hits and sacks on Buffalo making it a point to get the ball out of Josh Allen’s hands as quickly as possible, not getting TFLs in the run or pass game is damning. I also think Jonathan Hankins’ roster spot needs serious re-examination; if he’s not providing run defense then he’s not providing anything.', 'Derick Hall', 'What was that? Derick’s been great this year but that roughing the passer on Josh Allen was obvious, dumb, and Jarran Reed rightly got into it with him for that awful penalty. That was basically a four-point play at a minimum. He’s probably going to get fined, too.', 'Dee Williams', 'Yeah his turnover was in garbage time but it’s another demerit. That’s two muffed punts (it should’ve been three), a bobbled punt, a dropped kickoff, and several other questionable kick and punt return decisions that have contributed to the Seahawks having terrible field position on the regular.', 'I vouched for him as an intriguing UDFA add. He is not working out. The Seahawks will have several players coming off IR/PUP soon, and there will be players getting waived to make room. Williams has put himself in prime position to be let go with how much of a near-weekly disaster he’s been.', 'Geno Smith', 'Here’s the funny thing: I don’t think Geno had a bad game. The interception was bad and he certainly chanced it on a couple of other throws, but I didn’t see him as a liability. People were not getting open and then they had to play from a deficit, turning this into another one-dimensional rescue mission. The field goal drive was almost entirely Geno’s work: 9/9 for 94 yards, and the damaging play was not his fault. The poor performance by the defense meant long clock-killing drives that limited possessions.', 'But the play that irks me the most is the “taunting” flag—look, it’s not taunting, but they called it that—because he lost his cool after not getting a roughness penalty when he was hit out of bounds. The frustration was really palpable and he lost his cool in a way that he shouldn’t. Smith also committed a couple of delay of game penalties trying to make adjustments at the line with the clock running.', 'Assessing leadership through snippets of television is generally a pointless endeavor, so I’m not really interested in that discussion. This wasn’t even a thing that was brought up two years ago. The pouting on the sideline looks bad (especially juxtaposed to Russell Wilson’s relentless positivity), but Hall of Fame quarterbacks have done that—including the dude in the FOX booth.', 'This may not be the place to discuss it when it can be an article in itself, but ask yourself this: Does the timeline of Smith (not too many years, most likely) align with the timeline of Seattle having a path back to serious playoff contention? Because right now the latter looks like it’s years away when Geno is nearer to 40 than 35. A snazzy new QB right this minute is not going to change the fact that this team has a bad OL and a bad defense and a bad running game and even bad special teams. That’s not the same thing as when Wilson arrived to an already talented team.', 'Ryan Grubb', 'Grubb has enjoyed elite offensive lines throughout his college career. He doesn’t seem able to adjust to the weaknesses of his own OL other than to call a bunch of screen passes. The pocket never gets moved. There are no slants ever thrown. Play-action continues to not be a factor in this offense. What good is it to be able to quickly get to the line if the offense repeatedly has issues lining up properly and committing false starts?', 'I get that the poor OL is hamstringing what Grubb can do, but this isn’t the first bad Seahawks OL and it’s not the last. There have been other OCs, including Shane Waldron, who’ve done a much better job scheming around OL deficiencies than he has.', 'Mike Macdonald', 'Another day of double-digit penalties and general disorganization. He’s fixated on attention to detail and it looks absent on the field. Looking poorly coached in all three phases of play falls on him, no matter how inexperienced he and most of the rest of his staff are. Of course there will be growing pains, but the actual roster isn’t so inexperienced and overhauled to the point where it should look this disjointed like it has almost every week.', 'Lumen Field crowd', 'Another game where it’s like a road game but in Seattle. I can recall the stands being filled even for some mediocre or downright terrible 2008-2011 teams. What I can’t deny is that the makeup of the fanbase fundamentally changed after 2012, and with raised expectations from the peak Seahawks years, we’re getting a response to the dropoff from the glory years.', 'Beyond the ticket prices, there’s probably an apathetic feeling toward the Seahawks. And being mediocre without any hope of contention in sight is what led to TV blackouts and empty seats throughout the 1990s and a massive chunk of the pre-2005 Mike Holmgren era. But those Seahawks teams didn’t have a tremendous run of success to precede the not-so-good years. Seattle isn’t and hasn’t been 3- or 4-win bad for 15 years, but looking like a 7-9 win team with no sign of upward mobility may have enough fans determining it’s not worth it. The Seahawks already have lost their home field edge and don’t look like they’re going to get it back any time soon.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.

Meanwhile, the Seahawks descended into chaos, with two defensive linemen throwing punches at each other on their own sideline.', 'Allen finished 24 of 34 for 283 yards. He ran his streak of passes without an interception to 300 before Josh Jobe picked him off in the second quarter. But Seattle (4-4) turned the ball over on downs after that pick, with quarterback Geno Smith stumbling after he took the snap on fourth-and-goal from the 1.', '“That was huge,” Allen said. “I hate throwing turnovers, but I made the tackle. Coach talks about all the time if something like that happens, not to put your head down. Go make a tackle and let your defense come back on the field because you never know what’s going to happen.”', 'Allen responded by leading a 12-play, 93-yard drive that concluded with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Kincaid for a 14-3 lead.', 'Buffalo also went 90 yards on 14 plays after the opening kickoff, and Allen found Keon Coleman for a 2-yard TD to finish a drive that lasted 9:07.', 'The Bills became the first team to have two TD drives of 90 yards or more in a half since 2022, when Carolina did it against Detroit.

They rushed for only 32 yards and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.', ""“That’s the result of good football team that outplayed us in three phases and then it gets out of hand when you’re doing the things we we did today,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “The long and short of it is we got outplayed, we got outcoached, and we've got to go make it right.”"", ""Seattle had the ball at the Buffalo 2 with a chance to tie the game midway through the second quarter, but center Connor Williams sent a shotgun snap over Smith’s head that skittered past the 30.

The Bills showed an ability to get explosive plays in the passing game, with gains of 23 yards (Dawson Knox) and 25 yards (Keon Coleman) on the drive."", 'The Allen-Coleman connection on the jump ball set the tone for what turned out to be a dominant performance by the Bills. The QB-WR duo nearly had a TD a few plays earlier but made up for it with a perfect pitch and catch.', '""Simple football play. We miscued on the first one. Told him, just put it behind and give me another shot at it. He gave me another shot and I went up and made a play,"" Coleman said.', ""Buffalo outgained Seattle 445-233, converted eight third downs while allowing just one and won the time of possession battle by over 15 minutes. When asked if Sunday's performance ranked among their best of the season, Allen shared that he was impressed by the team's effort in every phase of the game."", '""It\'s up there. I think you look at it from all three phases. I think everybody went out there, knew their job and executed at a high level, offense, defense, special teams,"" the QB said.', ""The Bills recorded their second-highest rushing total of the season, gaining 164 yards on the ground. Buffalo's defense also excelled in stopping the run, holding Seattle to 32 yards."", ""Even more impressive, the Seahawks had just 1 rushing yard in the first half.

""All these things lead to momentum, right? You see guys straining. You see guys giving great effort. You see guys offensive lineman finishing plays where James has the ball, and they\'re finishing right on his heels.""', 'The Bills took advantage of some costly mistakes by the Seahawks.', 'In the first quarter, a bad snap went over the head of Seahawks QB Geno Smith at the Buffalo 3-yard line.

Buffalo Bills stormed past inept Seattle Seahawks in Week 8,https://www.buffalorumblings.com/2024/10/27/24281293/buffalo-bills-washed-away-seattle-seahawks-chances-in-week-8-opinion,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Josh Allen and the Bills were nearly unstoppable in Week 8', 'The Buffalo Bills defeated the Seattle Seahawks 31-10 in a Week 8 clash of division-leading teams that felt nowhere near as close as the final score might reveal. A 21-point divide does not define a close finish on any level, but the dominance Buffalo doled out on Sunday isn’t fully evident by their margin of victory.', 'The Bills scored touchdowns in every single quarter, totaling 7, 7, 10, and 7 in each. Teams that consistently manage to put points on the board are nearly impossible to beat. That’s especially true when good teams already hold a very comfortable lead and continue to pounce on points. Buffalo didn’t trail all afternoon, finding perhaps their biggest adversity to be the weather and outcome of the opening coin toss.', 'As for that weather? It was anything other than a beautiful day in Seattle, but the Bills rose above every challenge it presented. After quarterback Josh Allen threw his first interception of the season, Buffalo didn’t give up a single point — thanks to Allen running down the would-be pick-six, and the defense defending their dirt and more from inside the three-yard line.', 'A rain-soaked first half did its best to level the playing field, but the football continued bouncing Buffalo’s way — best illustrated by Allen’s fumble while running that stayed with the Bills. The same can’t be said of the Seahawks, which managed to self-destruct at every perfect opportunity given to them. Every. Single. Chance: Wasted.', 'Teams that have two golden opportunities to score touchdowns from three yards out at home need to punch the ball in. There are zero excuses. That’s what separates great teams from good ones. Yet twice on Sunday, Seattle was unable to keep its composure well enough to hit paydirt.', 'The Seahawks’ failings on two key plays were as much due to inept execution as it was Buffalo’s defense. It’s a fair bet that Seattle sports radio and sister site Field Gulls will be talking plenty about the Seahawks’ failures in the red zone — especially the bad snap that sailed 20 yards behind quarterback Gino Smith, and that failed fourth-down where quarterback Gino Smith ended up tripped by the center and on the turf.', 'Once again, Josh Allen found his way to an early exit when it was clear the outcome was all but reported. That may limit his statistical success, but every single Bills fan should welcome camera shots of Allen sitting on the sideline thanks to a blowout.', 'On the day, Allen finished an efficient 24-of-34 for 283 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception. He added seven runs for 25 yards — and even ceded goal-to-go touches to running back James Cook. That meant Cook was able to run the ball in for six twice, while finishing with 17 carries for 111 yards. Sunday’s win was the first time this season that Cook went over 100 yards on the ground.', 'Wide receiver Amari Cooper had a quiet second outing with the Bills, catching just one pass on two targets for three yards. Less time should be spent on what Cooper didn’t accomplish, and more should be spent on what Buffalo’s complementary receivers did all afternoon.', 'Wide receivers Khalil Shakir and Keon Coleman had tremendous games. Shakir was nearly unstoppable again when targeted, finishing with a career-high nine receptions on 10 targets for 107 yards. A YAC machine, Shakir was compared to the likes of Wes Welker, Danny Amendola, and Cole Beasley by NFL Hall of Fame quarterback-turned analyst Tom Brady.', 'Week 8 was Shakir’s first 100-yard game of the season, and the third of his young NFL career. He’s a matchup nightmare for defenses, and someone who operates like a running back in traffic. When teams fail to bring him down on first touch, which is often, it’s trouble.', 'Keon Coleman continued his rookie ascent, this week proving to be a diabolical back-should-fade red-zone monster. Coleman finished with five receptions on seven targets for 70 yards and an improbable touchdown. He again showed his skills in traffic and a knack for getting YAC — all while going up against a very talented cornerback in Tariq Woolen.', 'Even tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox got in on the action with several big downfield plays. Knox caught both his targets in critical moments, totaling 50 yards. Kincaid saw a healthy share of targets (7), hauling in five for a punishing 31 yards and one touchdown.', 'Regarding Buffalo’s defense, Week 8 may have been the best first-half by defensive coordinator Bobby Babich’s group — from assistant coaches on down to every player on that side of the ball. Holding Seattle to three points at home in the opening half is no small feat, even without wide receiver DK Metcalf.', 'There are plenty of Bills defenders who deserve shoutouts, from each and every defensive lineman, to linebackers Dorian Williams and Baylon Spector continuing to pick up the slack, and of course the clinic put on by every member of Buffalo’s defensive backfield.', 'Of course, the Buffalo Bills didn’t play perfect football. The elephant in the room is that excessive amount of penalties. It was ugly for both sides, with the FOX broadcast at one point sharing that the combined 23 penalties were the most in any game this season. There’s still time to clean things up, and I expect it to be a priority with head coach Sean McDermott. Against better teams, penalties are sure to carry greater harm than the Bills found in Week 8.', 'Up next for the Buffalo Bills are the Miami Dolphins, who visit Highmark Stadium with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa back in charge.', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

Thad Brown: Bills get key development in Seattle thrashing,https://www.rochesterfirst.com/sports/buffalo-bills/thad-brown-bills-get-key-development-in-seattle-thrashing/,"['RochesterFirst', '', '', '', '', '', 'by: Thad Brown', 'Posted: Oct 28, 2024 / 01:38 AM EDT', 'Updated: Oct 28, 2024 / 01:54 AM EDT', '', '', '', 'SEATTLE, Wash. (WROC) — The Bills wasted a draft pick trading for Amari Cooper. My column:', 'That was the thought rolling around in my head most of the second half. It’s not accurate, but it would have made for some social media fun. And probably a few headaches in the mentions via misunderstanding.', 'The Bills did trade for Amari Cooper two weeks ago as an apparent indication they were not satisfied with the weapons on offense. And probably not even close to satisfied. Cooper isn’t just another warm body. He’s a top receiver. The kind of guy who can alter offenses on his own and merits a giant chunk of any team’s targets.', 'He was a bystander Sunday in Seattle. He did play about half the snaps and made one catch, but the Bills did not need him. They dominated a first-place team with a ton from the guys who have been in Buffalo all year.', 'None were more encouraging than Keon Coleman. He backed up his first 100-yard NFL game with five more catches for 70 yards and a touchdown. That included a 1-on-1 win against one of the game’s top corners in Tariq Woolen. And it came two snaps after Coleman had lost the same battle.', '“We miscued on the first one. Told (Josh Allen) put it even higher. Give me another shot at it,” Coleman said. “He gave me another shot. I went up there and made the play.”', 'David Edwards pointed out later how tough it is to be a rookie in the NFL and how encouraging it is to see Coleman succeed. Plays like that not only build confidence for Coleman, but it builds Allen’s trust in him. Cooper is a receiver who can win physically, but not at the same level Coleman has the potential to reach. If Coleman can develop into a consistently dependable red zone and secondary threat, it might be more exciting for the Bills offense than the arrival of Cooper.', 'It wasn’t just Coleman who shined in this game. Shakir’s first 100-yard game is going to be unfairly glossed over. His run-after-the-catch ability was on display over and over. Dalton Kincaid saved an Allen scramble to find the end zone. Knox hit a couple of big catches. James Cook topped 100 yards with ease.', 'The parts of this offense that didn’t seem good enough two weeks ago blew the doors off a good team in a great building. It’s not quite “Everybody Eats”, but it’s probably a necessary development if the Bills are going to fully reclaim their Super Bowl expectations.', '“It shows that everybody has a piece of this puzzle,” Dion Dawkins said. “They have to be able to push their piece into the picture every game.”', 'I really liked the puzzle-builder in this game. Joe Brady did a great job of putting his pieces in positions where they aren’t only comfortable, but positions where they feel strong. We saw Coleman win end zone jump balls every other day in camp. Brady gave him two in a row Sunday and used him a bit more out of the slot to help Coleman avoid the press coverage that’s been locking him up. Shakir got to display his run-after-the-catch ability throw after throw. Both tight ends were schemed into big plays over the middle.', 'This game plan wasn’t ridiculously clever. It was ruthlessly logical.', 'The Bills also mixed in one of those strong starts they’ve been chasing. Greg Rousseau pretty much took care of an opening three-and-out stop by himself. The offense then went on a 14-play drive that felt like 40, but still ended up in the end zone. There was a ton of talk afterward about how much energy and confidence was generated from starting up 7-0. Rasul Douglas said it’s something the Bills worked on in practice all week. Even though Sean McDermott said the Bills could not identify the problem, the Bills did locate a solution.', 'With DK Metcalf on the sideline for this game, the defensive effort will be saddled with a grain of salt. It really shouldn’t. Buffalo became the first team all year to hold Seattle under 20 points and limited the top passing offense in the game to a pedestrian 201 yards.', 'I think this game was another feather in the cap for Christian Benford and Rasul Douglas. When Nico Collins was knocked out of the game in Houston, Benford and Douglas were the better pair in their battle with Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell. Similarly, they throttled Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba into seven catches for 78 yards.', 'There are probably five or seven receivers truly superstar receivers in the NFL. Collins and Metcalf might be among them. It’s hard to expect any corner to hang with players at that level in a league driven to make defense difficult. Anything below that, Benford and Douglas are the better side.', 'I was even more impressed with the run defense. No Terrel Bernard. No DeWayne Carter. Yet, the fighting Baylon Spectors held Seattle running backs to 12 carries for only 16 yards. Kenneth Walker is a pretty good back. I thought Seattle maybe should have tried him more. It probably would not have mattered. For this day, the Bills run D played wildly above their bottom five ranking.', 'They really ruined one of my favorite NFL trips. I’m a big fan of a Bills weekend in Seattle. I love the city vibe. The coast line view. Pike’s Place market. Lumen Field is at the top of the attractions list. It’s a uniquely gorgeous building that’s earned a reputation for a ferocious fan base.', 'And the Bills eradicated the fan element from just about all 60 minutes of this game. I coulda got this experience at milquetoast MetLife.', 'As well as Buffalo played, it almost didn’t go quite that easy. In fact, it probably shouldn’t have. Lady Luck and a menu full of Seattle blunders helped out a bunch.', 'The Seahawks turned first and goal at the three and third and goal at the one into three points because Smith and his center couldn’t execute a snap without hilarious calamity. On the flip side, Allen’s hilarious calamity turned into a third down conversion when his fumble rolled through two Seattle defenders like a Tage Thompson pass into the slot. The Bills 14-3 first-half lead, even if deserved, could have easily been 14-7 Seattle with the Seahawks owning a first down in the red zone with three minutes to play in the second quarter.', 'Then, Seattle put on a clinic on being undisciplined. The only debate was which 15-yard flag was the most stupid.', 'Derick Hall’s roughing the passer gifted Buffalo at least four points (and perhaps seven, depending on your current confidence level with Tyler Bass). Coleman blocks Josh Jobe into the Bills bench for an obvious flag, but Jobe couldn’t keep his head long enough to let it stand. Smith should have earned a late hit flag from Taron Johnson’s contact out of bounds (it’s debatable and the only of these calls I’d quibble with), but ended up with the 15 yards going his way on a taunting call. It got to the point in the first half where Dawkins was trying to help the Seahawks settle down while they argued amongst themselves at midfield.', '“We’re all out there playing football together,” Dawkins said. “Whatever they got, I hope they tie it up and push forward.”', 'The Bills dominated Seattle, but they didn’t do it alone. There was a good amount of help. The Bills probably win no matter what, but it could have come with quite a bit more challenge.', 'I was a little surprised the Bills weren’t passing out hats and T-shirts in the locker room after the game. While it may take a while for the math to catch up, Buffalo clinched a 5th straight AFC East championship on Sunday. Just before the Bills hammered the Seahawks, the Jets and Dolphins suffered embarrassing home losses to the Pats and Cardinals.', 'Buffalo now has as many wins as the rest of the division combined. More important, they own a 3.5-game lead less than halfway into the season. It’s over. This race will be called faster than New York or Texas in the presidential election.', 'The Bills and Jets might have comparable talent levels on paper, but the Bills know a heckuva lot better how to win with that talent. They know how to coach up backups, how to develop young players and how to make the most of their role guys. The reward will be cruising to another playoff appearance that starts at home.', 'Where it ends is a fair question right now. Seattle is the only of Buffalo’s six wins that came against a team that does not have a losing record at the moment. It’s not the type of win that should vault Buffalo into the thick of the Chiefs-Ravens conversation (Even if the Ravens got picked off by Cleveland Sunday. Division losses on the road against a new QB are excusable).', 'If the Bills continue to get 200 yards and two touchdowns from the Coleman-Shakir-Kincaid group on offense, their playoff ceiling is going to get very high. Rapidly. That’s the exciting part of this win. It was the supporting pieces–the ‘not good enough’ pieces–who engineered it.', 'The even better news is that Cooper probably won’t have a game as unproductive as he did in Seattle. When he gets fully baked into the offense, that’s when we’ll find out just how dangerous this Bills team can be. Bills Mafia should be pretty excited to find out.', 'Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Rapid Reactions: Seahawks Fall Behind Early & Can't Recover In Week 8 Loss To Bills,https://www.seahawks.com/news/2024-week-8-rapid-reactions-seahawks-fall-behind-early-can-t-recover-in-week-8-loss-to-bills,"['Seahawks.com Senior Reporter', ""The Seahawks fell behind early in Sunday's game against the Bills, but had chances to get back in it despite the slow start thanks to multiple trips to the red zone. But instead of shifting the momentum, miscues caused the Seahawks to come up mostly empty in those situations, and the Bills capitalized, extending the lead on their way to a convincing 31-10 victory at Lumen Field."", ""Here are five rapid reactions to Sunday's loss, which dropped Seattle's record to 4-4:"", 'The Seahawks came into the game knowing they were facing a tough challenge in the form of the Josh Allen-led Bills offense, and that unit was as advertised, and then some, getting the job done through the air and on the ground to lead Buffalo to a convincing victory.', 'The Bills started the day by driving 90 yards on 14 plays for a touchdown their opening possession, then they ended the first half with a 93-yard touchdown drive. Buffalo added three more scores to start the second half, a 69-yard drive that ended in a field goal, a 51-yard touchdown drive following a turnover, and a 73-yard drive for another touchdown, punting only once and committing one turnover before getting conservative late in the game and punting on its final two possessions.', 'For the game, the Bills gained 445 yards, the second most by a Seahawks opponent this year, had 29 first downs, the most by an opponent this season, went 8 for 14 on third down, and averaged 6.4 yards per play.', 'In addition to Allen passing for 283 yards and two touchdowns, the Bills also rushed for 164 yards, marking the fifth time this season an opponent has rushed for more than 150 yards against Seattle.', 'Must-see shots of the Seahawks at their Week 8 matchup against the Buffalo Bills at Lumen Field on Sunday, October 27, 2024.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'After starting the game with two three-and-outs, the Seahawks offense got going early in the second quarter, quicky driving down the field on the strength of Geno Smith completions, but after a 10-yard pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba set up first-and-goal from the 2-yard line, the next play was a 1-yard loss after Kenneth Walker III lost his footing, and on second-and-goal, center Conor Williams fired a snap well over the head of Geno Smith, resulting in a 19-yard loss. The Seahawks then took a delay-of-game penalty to make it third-and-27, and had to settle for a field goal instead of tying the game with a touchdown.', 'The next time the Seahawks got deep into the red zone, this time thanks to a Josh Jobe interception and 33-yard return, disaster struck again. This time, with the Seahawks going for it on fourth-and-goal from the 1, Smith was tripped up by Williams while taking the snap, resulting in a 6-yard loss and a turnover on downs.', 'So despite having first-and-goal inside the 10-yard line twice in the second quarter, the Seahawks managed just a single field goal from those promising opportunities.', 'The Bills were a handful on Sunday regardless of anything the Seahawks might have done to hurt themselves, but on a day where very little went right, the Seahawks also managed to make things a lot worse with 13 penalties for 85 yards.', 'Whether it was a Boye Mafe sack erased by an illegal contact penalty, or Derick Hall hitting Josh Allen late for a roughing the passer call on third down to extend a drive that ended in a touchdown, or a sequence in the third quarter that saw the Seahawks flagged for holding, a false start, taunting and illegal formation on four straight plays, the Seahawks found plenty of ways to get in their own way while also battling a very good opponent.', ""Josh Jobe started at cornerback for the second straight week after being elevated from the practice squad, and after a strong performance in last week's win in Atlanta, Jobe was able to snag his first career interception against the Bills, jumping a slant route to intercept Bills quarterback Josh Allen. Jobe returned the pick 33 yards to the Bills 7-yard line, but the Seahawks were unable to covert in the red zone. It was still a nice moment for Jobe, however, and the play also marked the third time in as many seasons when the Seahawks have ended a long interception-free streak for opposing quarterbacks."", ""Back in 2022, Tampa Bay's Tom Brady needed just three more pass attempts without an interception to break Aaron Rodgers' record of 402 consecutive passes without a pick, but Cody Barton ended the streak just short of the record with an interception in Munich. Last season, Last season, Detroit's Jared Goff was approaching that same record, with his streak reaching 383 attempts without an interception before Tre Brown intercepted him and returned it 40 yards for a score. Allen, meanwhile, had not thrown an interception this season, and had gone 301 attempts, going back to last season, without throwing one before Jobe picked him off."", ""While there aren't generally a lot of silver linings in a 21-point loss at home, it's worth highlighting the performance of punter Michael Dickson, who had another great game in a career full of them. Dickson's first two punts were more than 60-yards long, and both pinned Buffalo inside its 20, including a 68-yard punt, and he finished the game averaging 61.3 yards on four punts."", ""The 12s are excited for the Seahawks' Week 8 matchup against the Buffalo Bills at Lumen Field on Sunday, October 27, 2024."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2024 Tickets On Sale Now!', 'Secure your tickets today to experience the best gameday in the NFL!', '© Seattle Seahawks 2023.

What The Seahawks Said Following Their 31-10 Loss To The Bills,https://www.seahawks.com/news/what-the-seahawks-said-following-their-31-10-loss-to-the-bills,"['Featuring postgame quotes from the following:', ""MIKE MACDONALD: That's a result of good football team that outplayed us in three phases, and then it gets out of hand when you're doing the things we did today where we didn't help ourselves as well. It's a laundry list of things. We can go line item by line item if you want. The long and short of it is we got outplayed, outcoached, and we got to go make it right. Feel like it's too often we have had this conversation with you guys of going back to work on Tuesday and hitting this thing head on and seeing if we can get this thing turned around against a good Rams team coming in here."", 'How different does that game feel if you capitalize in the red zone on those two second quarter trips?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: Hard to tell if it flips, but you feel like you're right in it. Again, it's a story of red zone, us not getting stops in the red zone that we need, and then not being able to run the ball inside the five-yard line. We need to be better there for sure."", 'The one I guess where Geno fell back, what happened on that?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: I think he just got stepped on. You guys might have seen it. I didn't see it. He either got tripped or got stepped on."", 'Just big picture looking at the miscues made today, how do you feel the guys were trying to handle that in the moment. Seemed like obviously Derick Hall and Jarran Reed got into it...', ""MIKE MACDONALD: Well there is some frustration there. Look, our guys are connected, and they have each other's backs. They are emotional. There are going to be flare-ups and stuff. Seems like it calmed down. Wasn't a smart penalty. Just that's not how we train our guys to attack quarterbacks, so wasn't a smart move."", ""Where is your concern level with where the run game is at now? Second time in three, four games you've gone out there with under 2.2 yards per carry."", ""MIKE MACDONALD: Yeah, I would say it's a major concern. We've got to make it right. If I knew the one answer, I would give that to you right now. Seems like it's a litany of things. We've got to go to work on it. Right now, we can't control the tempo of games. We've got to go to work."", ""Any update on Dre'Mont Jones?"", ""MIKE MACDONALD: We'll see. I think he finished the game, so we'll take it from there."", 'Was DK Metcalf close to playing at all?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: I mean, he's only missed, what, two games in his career? I think that speaks for itself on his work ethic. I know he was trying to do everything humanly possible to play. It became clear later in the week he wasn't going to be able to go."", 'How much of an impact do you think not having him had on the offense?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: No, DK Metcalf is one of one, but we've got a lot of really good players that can play. We expect them to go in and execute at a high level. We need to be able to move the ball on the ground and in the air. We've got to be able to score in the red zone. DK wouldn't have been out there on the goal line on the one- or two-yard line."", ""What did you make of Ernest Jones IV's first game with you guys?"", ""MIKE MACDONALD: Tough to tell right now. Felt like he made some plays out in space. Got to look at the run game on some of those runs that were getting out and figure out what's going on there."", ""Some of these games, just how tough is the situations Geno has been in, whether it's the score or the run game?"", ""MIKE MACDONALD: It's too often we're in throw-mode at the end. Again, it starts with dictating terms to the other team, controlling the game, the pace of the game, taking care of the football. So yeah, we've put him in tough situations late in game for sure."", 'Picking off Josh Allen for the first time in like 300 pass attempts for him, what did that mean I guess just as far as that moment?', 'MIKE MACDONALD: It was a lone kind of bright spot in the game. Felt like we had a chance to really turn the momentum there and Josh had a great technique on that play, and then when he had the opportunity, he took advantage of it. So that was great at the time. Felt like we had a chance to get the thing rolling.', 'How indicative is or is this not of where you are in this program right now?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: I think that's a good question. We talk about stacking wins around here, and when you're going on and off, back and forth, it's frustrating. You want to be able to build on the good things that we're doing so we can get our program to where we want it to go. When you take steps back like today, it's very sobering, frustrating. But this is the NFL. If you don't bring it and have your best against good teams, you're not going to win those games. Our guys know that. As coaches we've got to prepare our guys the best we can. We've got to call great games. This whole thing has to keep coming together. Time is ticking as we say. We are about halfway through the season now. But you take a step back, I mean, right in the thick of it in the division, and this game coming up is going to be a big one."", 'Seemed to really emphasize heavy personnel packages today. Extra offensive lineman and stuff. Was that something you guys were geared up for and what was giving you guys issues?', ""MIKE MACDONALD: Well it was more than they've shown on tape in those situations, but you still have to be ready for it. I thought we had a solid plan. Probably could have had some more front flexibility on that front to have some more answers, maybe some more movements. Those are things we talked about. You're trying to adjust throughout seeing where the ball is hitting to see if we can get some anchor points or play blocks better. So (a) combination of not trying to scrap what you have but also maybe just calm it down."", ""It wasn't good enough when they went to their big 12 personnel."", ""As up and down as it's been, do you even have a good read on whether your best would be as good as Buffalo or not know that yet?"", ""MIKE MACDONALD: No, I think everybody on this field knows our best can compete with them. And look, Buffalo is a great team. Been doing this thing for a long time. The record speaks for themselves. They've got great players. That's a vote of confidence in our guys, our people."", 'Just how frustrating in general is this day, kind of all the mistakes you guys made, the red zone drives in particular?', ""GENO SMITH: Yeah, extremely frustrating. I thought we prepared really well this week. I thought the guys were dialed in, we had great energy. Obviously, it didn't show up on game day today. We had too many self-inflicted wounds. That's been our story this season. We got down there in the red zone twice, had a shot at points, and came away with nothing. Well, we got three points, but we want to score touchdowns. Those are things that, again, we've got to be better at. I'm going to look at myself first and see what I've got to do better and take it from there."", ""How much different does a game feel if you're able to punch a ball in in those situations and tie it up or take a lead early?"", ""GENO SMITH: I think it's a much different game. Hats off to Buffalo. They came in and beat us at home. Their fans travel well. It was really loud in there and kind of felt like we were on the road at times. They came out and fought and beat us. We can say we made mistakes, but they capitalized. Those are things we've got to get better at, and we got a big week ahead so the time is now."", 'What did happen I guess on the one where you fell down on the fourth down?', 'GENO SMITH: I thought that was pretty obvious. You could see it.', 'You guys have had to play from behind a number of times in recent weeks. How challenging has it been to do it as often as you needed to it here over the last stretch?', ""GENO SMITH: You never want to play from behind, but those are the cards we were dealt and you've got to do it. We put ourselves in those positions, so if there is anyone to be frustrated at it's our own self. We can play from behind. We have shown that we can fight back and get back into games. You don't want to make a living out of that. For us, we start talking about fast. Two three-and-outs to start the game is unacceptable. That is not the standard. Just the way in which started the second half, didn't get points; had a turnover; not the standard. And so when you talk about all the things we want to do well, I don't think we did any of those today. We've got to look at ourselves, in the mirror, and take it from there."", 'What do you need to do the next few days to get this behind you and move on?', ""GENO SMITH: First of all, got to own it and learn from it. Each one of those games, whether you won or lose, it's a lesson to be learned. That's the major thing, is we learn the lessons. Never want to go from a game and say we just put it behind us. That's the wrong way to look at it. Got to learn from your mistakes and own it. Those are things I'm going to do personally and I know our team is going to do as well. We're going to take it from there. One day at a time."", '(On the challenges presented by Buffalo\'s offense) ""Obviously, they run the ball. That\'s something we have to continuously work on. It\'s just about execution at the end of the day.""', '(On the frustration of this game after last week\'s game) ""Extremely frustrating. Obviously, we wanted to come in and keep it rolling. But like I said, it\'s about the little things right now that we need to get done and get right and get fixed so we can continue to win and keep going.""', '(On how far he thinks Seattle is from a team like Buffalo, and the other top teams in the league) ""Not far at all. It\'s us right now. We\'re beating ourselves. It\'s about us. Once we come together and play our style of football, we\'ll be good.""', '(On the mood at halftime) ""We were good. The game wasn\'t over, we were going to fight to the end. That\'s who we are. Things are going to happen in a football, that\'s part of this sport. We just got to keep going and keep pushing.""', '(On seeing CB Josh Jobe get his first interception, was that a positive note) ""100 percent. He had a great week of practice. He made a ton of plays. We expected that from him. He stepped up, played big. I\'m extremely happy for him.""', '(On what went wrong) ""We couldn\'t stop the run when we needed to. That really was the biggest thing. We just couldn\'t stop it and got outplayed. We just have to get better.""', '(On Mike Macdonald\'s message after the game) ""We just have to get back to work. We just have to get back to work and keep going. We can\'t beat ourselves up and be down on ourselves about the loss. We have to pick our heads up and keep moving.""', '(On why the Bills were able to keep Josh Allen clean today) ""They were just playing good football. They weren\'t doing anything special really. They just played great football. Good team and they came out here and wanted it more and they got the [win].""', '(On if the Bills did anything different than what they saw on film) ""No. They did everything that we\'ve seen on film. We just came up short.""', '(On playing the Bills in back-to-back games) ""It doesn\'t happen too often. It was kind of a similar game. Didn\'t win both times I played them. It was kind of different playing the same team twice. Coming in here, we expected to win, but we just fell short.""', '(On if they had an idea of what they were going to do coming into the game) ""They\'re really not going to do too much. The Bills want to do their best and execute at that level. They didn\'t come in here and do anything special. Of course, they have special runs and passes for this team, but they come out and they execute what they do at a high level.""', '(On getting up to speed with a short week and adjusting to the team) ""I will say this, the plays in a sense are mirrored and the same from Tennessee. It\'s just different terminology. You\'re trying to get on the same page with the guys in front of you and behind you. That was kind of different. For me, just come in here, go out there and tackle and do what I can to help.""', '(On if he felt the defense had a sloppy performance) ""I don\'t know. I can\'t assess that right now. I know we had a lot of missed tackles, and that\'s just something we\'ve been working on throughout the season. So, like I said, it\'s just an overall practical performance, and it stings, it hurts, but we have to be ready to go. L.A.\'s on a good run, and they\'re coming here next week.""', '(On the conversation with Jarran Reed) ""To just be smart. He loves the game. I love the game, and in that moment, things got heated. But he\'s a leader. He\'s the leader of our group, and when stuff hits the fan, you have to lean on the guys. And maybe we both could have done something a little bit better, but he wants me to go out and play smart, play fast, play physical, and that was basically his message in that moment.""', '(On what happened during the fourth downplay) ""I\'m not sure. I\'m going to have to go back and look at the film and see what happened, but at the end of the day, I mean fourth and one, you can\'t allow penetration; you got to set the tone as the line, and so that\'s on us.""', '(On if he feels like this team is lacking discipline) ""I think at the end of the day, we got the right attitude. We got the right men in the room, and it\'s just about focusing on the details and being able to build on them one day at a time, one step at a time.""', '(On Mike Macdonald\'s message to the team after the game) ""We see the wall. We know the wall in front of us, and it\'s about going through the wall.""', '(On how it felt to get back on the field) ""It felt good, honestly. I just wish we could\'ve won, that\'s really what it is for me. It doesn\'t make any difference if I\'m on the field or not, we\'re just not winning. It felt good to be back, but I just wanna win. We know we can get it right.""', '(On it feeling disjointed out there defensively and what he can point to in that regard) ""Honestly, I don\'t know, we\'ve got to go watch the film. Other than that, we still finished the game and we still fought. We just lost to a better team today, and we just got to be better next time.""', '(On if it felt like today was as sloppy as it seemed) ""You never know until you look at the film. I don\'t know how you all view it. We lost today because they were better, and that\'s it. Other than that, we\'re going to watch film and do what we do. But other than that, game over, and now we\'ve got to (focus on) the next one.""', '(On whether the defensive line had a communication gap or the Bills\' style caused confusion) ""They\'re a good football team, everybody knows that. They get paid too. One of the best teams in AFC. We\'ve just got to execute, do what we do. They\'re going to make plays and they\'re going to do what they do, but it\'s all about what we do upfront. As a unit, we just got to make sure we\'re all on the same page.""', '(On it being his second week with the Seahawks and if he could tell a difference in his comfort level) ""Everything\'s getting better each day. Still learning the scheme, but I\'ve got a lot of good guys around me that are looking out for me and making sure I\'m where I\'m supposed to be and the communication, all that stuff is where it\'s supposed to be. So, everything\'s going up. Doing good right now.""', '(On the best way to correct penalties) ""Just getting back to playing how we know how to play. Playing clean. We\'ll go back and watch it, see what needs to be corrected, and then we\'ll get back to playing ball like we know how.""', 'Must-see shots of the Seahawks at their Week 8 matchup against the Buffalo Bills at Lumen Field on Sunday, October 27, 2024.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '2024 Tickets On Sale Now!', 'Secure your tickets today to experience the best gameday in the NFL!', '© Seattle Seahawks 2023.

Allen had 283 passing yards, a pair of TD tosses, and 25 more yards on the ground.', 'But on a day where many players on the Buffalo Bills offense chipped in, it was James Cook’s 111 rushing yards and two touchdowns that paved the way for the win. Cook averaged 6.5 yards per carry, as Seattle had virtually no answer for the third-year back.', 'Amari Cooper’s second game in a Buffalo Bills jersey was quiet. The future Hall of Famer only had one catch for three yards. He was overshadowed by rookie Keon Coleman, who had 70 yards and a touchdown, and Khalil Shakir, who grabbed a career-high 9 passes for 107 yards.', 'And on National Tight End Day, Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox combined for 6 receptions, 81 yards, and a touchdown that belonged to Kincaid.', 'Defensively, the Bills had a good team effort, but the biggest splash play was an interception from defensive tackle Austin Johnson.', 'Next up for Buffalo is a home game against the Dolphins, Nov. 3 at 1 p.m.', 'Any person with disabilities who needs help accessing the content of the FCC Public file should contact Gini Darden at gini.darden@whec.com or 585-546-1705', 'This website is not intended for users located within the European Economic Area.\n© 2024 WHEC-TV, LLC\nA Hubbard Broadcasting Company', '', '', '', '']"
5 predictions for Seahawks vs. Bills,https://www.fieldgulls.com/2024/10/27/24280645/week-8-2024-nfl-season-5-predictions-seattle-seahawks-vs-buffalo-bills,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Noah Fant hasn’t scored a touchdown since 2022. Does he end the drought against the Bills?', 'If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.', 'Good morning and happy Sunday, Seattle Seahawks fans! We’re just hours away from the Seahawks’ final game of October, and it should be a doozy against the Buffalo Bills. They were competitive against one Super Bowl contender in the Detroit Lions, can they go one step further and take out one of the AFC’s best? I’ll make my prediction shortly.', 'First, here’s a lookback at last week’s predictions:', 'Bold prediction: No sacks allowed for Michael Jerrell', 'The only sack on Geno Smith came from Michael Jerrell’s assignment. PFF did not ding Jerrell for the sack, which I don’t agree with watching the replay, but if the implication is the sack is really on Geno for not getting rid of the ball sooner, I will take their definition just to clinch a correct bold prediction for myself.', 'Seahawks offense prediction: “Dome Geno” throws for over 350 yards', 'Smith threw for 207 yards but he didn’t need to even throw for 300. I’ll gladly take being wrong here.', 'Seahawks defense prediction: Byron Murphy II records a sack', 'Nope. Got a TFL, though!', 'Enemy prediction: Drake London has over 100 yards receiving and a touchdown', 'Touchdown? Yes. Over 100 yards? Not even close.', 'Game prediction: Seahawks lose a shootout', 'I said 38-31. The Seahawks did their part by scoring over 30 points, but the Seahawks defense made sure there would be no shootout.', 'Pretty awful predictions but a couple of these were predictions I’d rather not have been correct to begin with.', 'We go again this week!', 'Bold prediction: Noah Fant gets his first touchdown in nearly two seasons', 'Noah Fant has done everything but get into the end zone this season. He had a slow start based off his first couple of weeks, and maybe his foot injury played a factor, but Fant has been a very efficient target for Geno Smith. He’s caught the last 21 passes thrown his way for 238 yards. Fant almost has as many first downs (14) through seven games as he managed all of last season (16). The only thing Fant hasn’t done is score a touchdown, which he didn’t do at all in 2023. You have to go back to Christmas Eve and garbage time against the Kansas City Chiefs for Noah’s last trip to the end zone.', 'With DK Metcalf not expected to play, combined with Buffalo being hindered by not having outstanding middle linebacker Terrel Bernard, I can see Fant being more involved in the offense as a pass catcher (especially off of play-action). I think the drought ends now. Fant will get his TD.', 'Seahawks offense prediction: Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet combine for over 100 yards rushing', 'This will be the sixth game in which Seattle’s top two running backs have played together. Walker rushed for over 100 yards in the season opener against the Denver Broncos, while Charbonnet had 12 yards. This is the only time they’ve combined for 100 on the ground. The closest they’ve come to repeating that feat was when Walker rushed for 80 and Charbonnet had 15 against the Detroit Lions.', 'We’ve seen a little bit more of an effort from Ryan Grubb to establish some sort of running game. The effort against the San Francisco 49ers was forced and terrible, while the Atlanta Falcons game was considerably better without being anything special.', 'Buffalo has averaged 5.1 yards per carry allowed, but that’s heavily skewed by the monster night by Derrick Henry and company when the Baltimore Ravens had over 270 on the ground. They’re statistically a good run defense by DVOA and by EPA/play, but they’re not impenetrable. On the road, they’ve given up that 199-yard game from Henry, 113 yards to Breece Hall, and 96 to De’Von Achane. With no Terrel Bernard and defensive tackle DeWayne Carter also out to injury, the Bills defensive depth will be tested. I have a feeling we’re going to see a good game from Walker, some serviceable carries from Charbonnet, and a focus on attacking Buffalo’s defensive front through a rushing attack that hasn’t really taken off yet.', 'Seahawks defense prediction: They’ll be the first team to intercept Josh Allen', 'Remember all of the Josh Allen interception discourse? He threw 18 last season and has thrown double-digit INTs almost every season of his career. Allen has made up for the picks by being (at least since 2020) extremely productive, Yes, he’s prone to some boneheaded plays and some very risky decisions, but that’s how he’s typically been.', 'Anyway, Josh Allen has thrown zero interceptions out of 189 attempts. He has lost two fumbles, which are Buffalo’s only giveaways all season. Allen is taking care of the ball better than he ever has, while still producing 15 total touchdowns.', 'And this is the day he gets picked. The Seahawks got their interception mojo back last Sunday when Julian Love and Coby Bryant got a pair of Kirk Cousins overthrows. With Riq Woolen back in the lineup, I think he’s going to be tested by Josh and he’ll announce his return with an INT. The expected rainy day may affect his accuracy enough to result in some errant throws and the potential for a turnover or two.', 'Enemy prediction: Josh Allen won’t get sacked', 'The Seahawks have a very good pass rush. The Bills have a very good offensive line and a quarterback who’s ridiculously hard to sack. Allen’s sack rate is just 4.55%, which is outstanding. We’ve seen Seattle struggle at times to convert those pressures into sacks, and Allen is phenomenal at escaping pressure.', 'Josh Allen is a freak athlete for someone his size and while this doesn’t mean he’ll avoid being under duress, it does mean that Allen will do everything in his power to not get sacked... and he’ll succeed.', 'Game prediction: Seahawks lose a close one', 'In my appearance with John Boccacino on the Bill-ieve podcast, I said the Seahawks would lose 31-27 in a game where whoever had the ball last would win. I was ignorant of the weather forecast on Sunday, which is not conducive to shootout football.', 'The concept remains the same where I envision the Seahawks being highly competitive with one of the top teams in the league, but ultimately come up just shot. Knock a touchdown off from both teams and consider it a 24-20 Bills win. But unlike the Falcons and 49ers games where I didn’t see a win coming at all, I wouldn’t be surprised if Seattle pulled off the upset on this occasion.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

Facing a 4th and Goal from the one, the Seahawks opted to go for it. The Seahawks would've taken the lead with a touchdown, needing just one yard.

This was a sign that it simply would not be the Seahawks' day."", '0:37 2nd Quarter: Derick Hall roughing the passer extends Bills’ drive', 'The ""drive from hell"" for the Seahawks continued to foreshadow the frustrating afternoon in Seattle. After Allen and the Bills extended the drive with a fumble and kicked ball forward, they were knocking on the door of going up two scores ahead of halftime. Once again, they faced a third down. On 3rd and 7, Allen rolled out and ended up throwing the ball away, which would have brought up a fourth down. However, defensive end Derick Hall hit Allen very late and a clear roughing the passer penalty was enforced. Once again, that extended the Bills\' drive that ended in a touchdown for a 14-3 Buffalo lead. The Seahawks would never sniff the Bills again.', '6:04 3rd Quarter: Geno Smith throws interception to Bills DT Austin Johnson', 'With the Seahawks still only down two scores in the third quarter, there was still time to comeback. Seattle crossed into Buffalo territory. On the Buffalo 40, Smith dropped back for a screen pass to Ken Walker III. It was tipped and it found the awaiting arms of nose tackle Austin Johnson from the Bills for a soul-crushing interception.

Finding some success early and capitalizing on Seattle mistakes, Buffalo cruised to an easy win.', 'Geno Smith and the ‘Hawks started off with the ball, and our beloved Bills looking to make a stop. Buffalo’s defense held strong and allowed a single yard, forcing a three-and-out. Brandon Codrington received the punt and tried to give Buffalo a little more breathing room, but a flag on Cam Lewis set them back.', 'Josh Allen tried to match the tone, finding Dawson Knox on their opening snap for 23 yards. James Cook and Ray Davis kept things going with another first, but flags were an early problem with a Davis’ 11-yard scamper called back thanks to offensive holding on Alec Anderson. On 3rd & 4, Dalton Kincaid moved the chains after Khalil Shakir had eaten into the distance from the flag. This was immediately followed by another flag, a false start on David Edwards.', 'The Seahawks found some pressure, landing a strip sack on Josh Allen that you won’t find on the stat sheet thanks to illegal contact on Devon Witherspoon of Seattle. A Josh Allen sneak kept the drive alive, and another promising play was wiped out by another offensive holding call, on Connor McGovern this time. After forcing 3rd & 10, Seattle looked to force Buffalo for a field goal try, but an Allen connection with Keon Coleman for 25-yards put Buffalo at the Seattle 16 with a first down. After an 11-yard run by James Cook, tipped pass floated dangerously in the air but was nearly reeled in for a Coleman touchdown. A Josh Allen scramble didn’t quite punch it in and a third down try at the goal line was a fantastic contested one-handed catch by Coleman for the first score of the game.', 'Now down by seven, Seattle got the ball back at the 30-yard line courtesy of a Tyler Bass touchback. Buffalo’s defense picked up where they left off, with Rasul Douglas dropping Kenneth Walker III for a two-yard loss. A four-yard gain and incomplete pass led to the second three-and-out to start the game.', 'Starting at the 12-yard line after the punt, the Bills started off with a pair of first downs. A couple deep shots and a false start set the Bills back to 3rd & 15. Khalil Shakir got most of it back, but not enough to avoid sending on Sam Martin and the punting unit. A rolling ball pinned the Seahawks at their own nine.', 'The flags continued with Seattle pushing themselves back four yards with an ineligible player downfield. A completion of nine yards put them close to the marker to end the first quarter. Another completion yielded the first, first down of the day for the Seahawks. With their groove found, Seattle drove down the field to the Buffalo two-yard line. A high snap led to the ball flying backwards and ultimately a loss of 19. Now 3rd & goal at the 22, Seattle was hit for a delay of game. A quick pass made the field goal try a bit easier, and Buffalo escaped the drive only giving up three points.', 'Starting at the 30 for drive three, Buffalo looked to be on the right track with a couple chunk plays. Josh Allen looked short right for Amari Cooper and was picked off by Josh Jobe, for Allen’s first interception of the season. With the rain coming down and excellent field position, the Seahawks were stymied at the goal line on third down. Electing to go for it on fourth, Geno Smith tripped and fell backwards for an easy tackle and turnover on downs.', 'Now backed up in the Valley of the Shadow of Safety, Buffalo struggled to move the chains until an unintentional Fumblerooski advanced the ball to the 23-yard line. Nearing midfield at the two-minute warning, the breather seemed to help Buffalo steady their approach as the Bills continued to drive into Seattle territory. An illegal shift and roughing the passer call looked like it would be offset, but led to a rare 5 v. 15 rule enforcement with Buffalo benefiting from the 15-yarder (more on that in this week’s penalty recap but don’t expect much more). With the drive continued, Josh Allen found Dalton Kincaid for a 12-yard touchdown.', 'Seattle had the ball back but little time and elected to kneel out the remainder of the clock, hoping for a better second half.', 'One of “those games,” the second half started with a flag on Spencer Brown for offensive holding. Keon Coleman gained the yardage back and then some on the ensuing short pass from Allen, creating a manageable second down. Leaning heavily on the pass despite the weather, Josh Allen found Khalil Shakir for a field-flipping 35-yard pass. Moseying down to first and goal, a delay of game flag set Buffalo back five. On the next play, Allen narrowly averted a sack to throw the ball away. Seattle was forced to burn a timeout with Buffalo facing 3rd & goal at the eight. The timeout would not be wasted with Buffalo failing to convert for the touchdown. For the Tyler Bass watchers, his try of 27 yards was good, putting Buffalo up by 14.', 'Rasul Douglas nearly came away with the ball as Ed Oliver impacted the pass with a QB hit. Now 2nd & 10, more pressure and a dropped pass looked good for the Bills until an illegal contact flag was thrown on Christian Benford. Seattle started to find a rhythm again. That is until Austin Johnson picked off Geno Smith at midfield. Austin Johnson, just like we all predicted.', 'After a few promising plays, a sideline skirmish resulted in offsetting unnecessary roughness flags. Another fantastic catch by Keon Coleman left the sticks in the dust to continue Buffalo’s drive. James Cook nearly brought it to the house against a reeling Seattle defense. After a brief reset between downs, Buffalo called Cook’s number again for a two-yard touchdown.', 'Laviska Shenault returned the ball on the ensuing kickoff and was hit hard at the 20-yard line. Another botched snap hurt the Seahawks and a flicker of light on second down in the form of a 14-yard pass was wiped out by an offensive holding call. Followed second later by a false start flag, the Seahawks looked ready to implode. After a decent scramble by Geno Smith led to him being hit on the sideline, Smith tossed the ball at his opponent rather than the ref leading to, you guess it, a penalty. Now 3rd & 20, a short pass did little for Seattle’s momentum and was punctuated by an illegal motion flag (declined) to boot. Down by three scores with the third quarter nearly over, Seattle was forced to punt deep from their own end zone.', 'An incomplete deep shot closed out Q3, and the final quarter saw two James Cook rushes leaving Buffalo with 4th & 1. The Bills elected to go for it and the resulting Allen “sneak” kept things trending Buffalo’s way. Dawson Knox caught a 27-yarder and the ‘Hawks’ implosion continued with a defensive pass interference call to give Buffalo a free 11 yards. That and the next penalty were only separated by a 12-yard James Cook rush. The five-yard encroachment set the Bills up with 1st & 5 at the at the seven. The drive only lasted one more play with Cook finding the end zone again.', 'Down four scores with less than a quarter to go, Seattle was firmly looking for a miracle. Finding chunks of yards passing, the Seahawks moved the ball well and found the end zone to cut the Buffalo lead to 21. A false start and incomplete pass led to a three-and-out, giving the Seahawks the ball back. A tripping call on the punt pushed Seattle way back on their side of the field.', 'Seattle tried valiantly to climb back, but obstacles continued to be insurmountable. A sack on third down near midfield pushed the Seahawks back to their own 34 and a delay of game (after a Buffalo timeout even) pushed them back even further. In what should have been clear four-down territory, Seattle punted on 4th & 24.', 'With five minutes to go and still up three scores, Mitchell Trubisky came in for Josh Allen to wrap up the game. A predictable run, run, run was stopped by Seattle. The final insult of the day came courtesy of a rain-slick field. Damarion Williams slipped while fielding the punt, sliding to where he was hoping to make the catch. As the ball bounced off Williams, an awaiting Mack Hollins scooped it up.', 'With the ball back and once again in scoring territory, Ray Davis ran to the left side and slid to make sure he stayed in bounds. With only the two minute warning left to stop the clock and Davis’ run earning a first down, the game was a long commercial break and a few kneel downs away from a Buffalo Bills victory.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

But Seattle (4-4) turned the ball over on downs after that pick, with quarterback Geno Smith stumbling after he took the snap on fourth-and-goal from the 1.', '“That was huge,” Allen said. “I hate throwing turnovers, but I made the tackle. Coach talks about all the time if something like that happens, not to put your head down. Go make a tackle and let your defense come back on the field because you never know what’s going to happen.”', 'Allen responded by leading a 12-play, 93-yard drive that concluded with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Kincaid for a 14-3 lead.', 'Buffalo also went 90 yards on 14 plays after the opening kickoff, and Allen found Keon Coleman for a 2-yard TD to finish a drive that lasted 9:07.', 'The Bills became the first team to have two TD drives of 90 yards or more in a half since 2022, when Carolina did it against Detroit. Buffalo outgained Seattle 445 yards to 233 and held the ball for more than 38 minutes.', '“We feel like every play we come out there and execute at a high level, I don’t think anybody really can stop us but ourselves,” Coleman said.', 'Smith went 21 of 29 for 212 yards and an interception for the Seahawks, who were largely inept on offense. They rushed for only 32 yards and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.', '“That’s the result of good football team that outplayed us in three phases and then it gets out of hand when you’re doing the things we we did today,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “The long and short of it is we got outplayed, we got outcoached, and we’ve got to go make it right.”', 'Seattle had the ball at the Buffalo 2 with a chance to tie the game midway through the second quarter, but center Connor Williams sent a shotgun snap over Smith’s head that skittered past the 30. Kenneth Walker III recovered the fumble, but the Seahawks settled for Jason Myers’ 38-yard field goal.', 'Jobe, elevated from the practice squad before the game, beat Amari Cooper to the ball on Allen’s first pass of the next drive, and the cornerback picked it off at the Buffalo 40 and returned it to the 7. Allen’s streak of 300 passes without an interception, including playoffs, was a franchise record.', 'A second mistake by Williams kept Seattle out of the end zone when he stepped on Smith’s foot on the fourth-down play and the quarterback fell.', 'Derick Hall was flagged for a late hit on Allen that extended Buffalo’s subsequent drive. Hall and teammates were shouting at each other and on the sidelines for the rest of the half. The Seahawks were called for three personal fouls in the game, including one by Smith.', 'Hall and fellow defensive lineman Jarran Reed exchanged punches on the sideline and had to be separated.', '“He loves the game, I love the game, and in that moment I think things got heated,” Hall said. “But you know, he’s a leader. He’s the leader of our group. And when stuff hits the fan, you have to lean on those guys. And maybe we both could do something a little bit better.”', 'With Buffalo leading 17-3 in the third quarter, defensive end Casey Toohill pressured Smith, who was retreating to throw a screen pass. Smith tried to loft it over Toohill, but he tipped the ball, which bounced off Walker’s hands and into the arms of defensive lineman Austin Johnson.', 'Cook scored from 2 yards out to put Buffalo up 24-3 with 2:01 left in the third. He added a 7-yard scoring run early in the fourth to send Seattle to its fourth loss in five games.', 'No rush', 'Buffalo held Seattle to 1 yard rushing in the first half, the second-fewest rushing yards the Bills had given up in a half this century. The Bills held the Indianapolis Colts to minus-11 yards in a half in 2010. Walker had six carries for 5 yards in the first half.', 'Injuries', 'Bills: WR Curtis Samuel (foot) was inactive.', 'Seahawks: WR DK Metcalf was inactive with a knee injury. … LB Dre’Mont Jones left in the second half with a shoulder injury, but returned to the game.', 'Up next', 'Bills: Host Miami on Sunday.', 'Seahawks: Host the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.', 'OLEAN — Southwestern/Jamestown won the Division 1 title with 468 points and Frewsburg/Falconer claimed the ...', '', 'Copyright © Observer Today | https://www.observertoday.com | PO Box 391, Dunkirk, NY 14048 | 716-366-3000', '']"

But Sean McDermott made it a point of emphasis during the week to come out of the gate flying, and the Bills heeded his call.', ""“It's always a priority, even though we haven’t done a great job of that,” McDermott said. “So I tell you guys, we go back and look at everything and so we went back and looked at some things, and I felt more than anything, we got into a rhythm early.”"", 'They sure did, thanks to the defense forcing two quick three-and-outs, and then Josh Allen igniting the offense on a first possession 91-yard touchdown drive that set the tone for the sunny, rainy, cloudy, sunny, rainy day.', ""“It was great,” Allen said. “Got off to a quick start, first drive, go down there and get points. It’s something that we've talked about repetitively over the course of the last couple weeks. Felt good to go out there and get it done.”"", ""When he was asked if this was the Bills’ best start to finish performance of the season, given the opponent and the venue, Allen said, “It's up there, and I think you look at it from all three phases. I think everybody went out there, knew their job, and executed it at a high level.”"", 'I agree, and my grades reflect that:', 'Allen was on point all day, even though he did throw his first interception of the season, a strange play where it looked like he expected Amari Cooper to be in better position for a quick slant, only to have CB Josh Jobe read it, jump the route and make the pick. Otherwise, Allen was nearly flawless in completing 24 of 34 for 283 yards and two TDs.', 'Khalil Shakir was great, as he always is. He caught nine of 10 targets for 107 yards and it just seemed like whenever Allen needed a completion, that’s where he went and Shakir came through. He now has caught 36 of the 38 balls thrown his way this season.', 'How about Keon Coleman maturing before our eyes on a weekly basis? He caught five for 70 and made a great catch over excellent CB Riq Woolen for the first TD of the day. Cooper was quiet as he still needs to learn the offense, one catch for three yards, while Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox combined for seven catches for 53 yards and a Kincaid TD.', 'Up front, the offensive line had a rough day with penalties, but when they weren’t breaking the rules, they kept Allen clean as he suffered just one sack.', 'James Cook ran like he was angry. We normally see him jitterbugging through the line and making people miss and he did plenty of that, but he also ran through contact and amassed his third career 100-yard game, finishing with 111, a 6.5 average, and two TDs including the second one where, as Allen said, “he lowered the boom.”', 'Ray Davis got some playing time late and gained 29 yards and taking three Mitch Trubisky kneel downs out of the mix, the Bills ran for 167 yards and 5.38 per attempt. The backs were excellent, but again, the line was creating space for them as the Bills clearly won the battle in the trenches. The Bills have now topped 150 yards rushing in three of their last four games.', 'Geno Smith came into the game as the NFL’s leader in passing yards per game at 283.6, but he had 123 through three quarters and finished with 212, almost all of it harmless as the Seahawks didn’t score their first touchdown until they were down 31-3.', 'He was clearly hampered by the absence of star WR DK Metcalf, but the Seahawks have other viable weapons in Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but the Bills did an outstanding job taking them away. JSN caught six for 69, but Lockett had one catch for nine yards. Rasul Douglas and Christian Benford continue to build their case as one of the most effective boundary CB duos in the league, and Taron Johnson just keeps plugging along, making plays in the pass and run game as he led the Bills with eight tackles.', 'Smith was sacked only once, that by Javon Solomon late in the game, but he was under pressure enough to be ineffective, and an AJ Epenesa pressure led to the interception Smith threw on a pass that was tipped by Casey Toohill and caught by DT Austin Johnson. That was some play, three different defensive linemen playing a role like that.', 'Coming into the game, Kenneth Walker was the Bills’ No. 1 priority because they knew the Seahawks would probably want to lean on him in the ground game with Metcalf out. Instead, Walker never had a chance to get going because the Seahawks only had the ball for 22 minutes, and almost that entire time they were trailing, much of it by double digits.', 'Walker finished with a measly 12 yards on nine carries, the second-lowest total of his NFL career, while Zach Charbonnet, a big, physical runner, was muted as well, four yards on three carries. On three of the biggest plays of the game, with Seattle staring at first-and-goal at the 7 after Allen’s second-quarter interception, both runners were stuffed a total of three times before the fourth-down play blew up when Smith tripped and fell pulling away from center, a massive turnover on downs that was one of the key moments in the game.', 'What was impressive about the run defense is that the Bills did this with LB Terrel Bernard out and Baylon Spector in his place. Spector finished with five tackles and held his own, though pass coverage remains a big problem for him.', 'It certainly wasn’t the cleanest game, though that doesn’t include the kickers. On a slick field, Tyler Bass made a 27-yard field goal and all four of his extra points, plus had five touchbacks on six kickoffs. Punter Sam Martin had an outstanding day with three punts that averaged 49 net yards because none were returned, one going out of the bounds at the 9.', 'On the downside, Cam Lewis’ illegal block on Seattle’s first punt gave the Bills a drive start at the 9 for their first possession of the game, and on the second possession, they started at the 12 because Brandon Codrington made a ridiculous decision to field a punt at the goal line.', 'Ray Davis was deep for the second-half kickoff and he made his own poor decision, fielding it three yards deep and only getting to the 23, costing the Bills seven yards of field position. And then in the fourth quarter, Reggie Gilliam had a hold on a kickoff return that pushed the Bills back to the 15.', 'Late in the game, the Seahawks muffed a punt and Mack Hollins recovered for Buffalo at the Seattle 26. So yeah, a mixed bag for sure.', 'McDermott had a call to make in the first quarter on fourth-and-2, but I thought at that point, punting from his own 42 was the right decision, even though I’m sure fans were up in arms. The Bills were already up 7-0 and there was no need to risk giving the Seahawks any momentum with a potential stop there. Martin’s punt went out of bounds at the 9, which further amplified that was the right call.', 'The Bills were ready to play, another check in the positive column for the coaches, but the penalties are a problem. Two weeks ago in the win over the Jets the Bills committed 11 for 94 yards, and in this one they had 13 for 85 yards. They managed to win both those games, but that’s not always going to be the case.', 'On offense, Joe Brady had a great feel in this game and he achieved excellent balance between the run and pass, though it’s easy to do that when both things are working, as 38 minutes of possession time, 8-of-15 on third, and season highs in first downs (29) and total yards (445) would suggest.', 'And on defense, Bobby Babich’s group had its way as it held the Seahawks to 1-of-8 combined on third and fourth down and 233 yards including just 32 on the ground, the lowest yield by the Bills since Nov. 17, 2019 against Miami.', 'Sal Maiorana has covered the Buffalo Bills for four decades including 35 years as the full-time beat writer for the D&C, and he has written numerous books about the history of the team.

It is with equal parts gratitude and sorrow that I announce this will be my final season writing Cigar Thoughts.', 'Few things have given me greater joy than recapping Seahawks games for y’all over the years and I am eternally grateful for the incredible support y’all have shown this column over the years. I am proud, appreciative, and satisfied.', 'The podcast will continue.', '—', 'You ever been to a stand-up show where the comedian absolutely bombs? You sit there, silently begging the person on stage to land a joke, squirming as it gets worse and worse. Honestly, I’d rather chew aluminum foil immediately after a root canal than witness such an obvious failure in real time, with no exit for the performer until the set mercifully ends. I can’t imagine a worse entertainment experience. At least, I couldn’t before watching today’s Seahawks game.', 'This was a circus, and not the fun kind. Seattle came into this game riding high off a potentially season-saving win over the Atlanta Falcons and parlayed that momentum into an absolute comedy of errors. There were no fewer than a half-dozen plays that you expect from a team like the Carolina Pnathers. Don’t hear what I’m not saying— it was extremely unlikely the Seahawks were going to win this game even without the errors, given how clean Buffalo was and how undisciplined Seattle was but even so— got damn.', 'Connor Williams, who has been really good lately, completely short-circuited in the redzone not once, but twice. During Seattle’s first scoring chance, he snapped the ball into orbit, leading to a 20-yard loss that ended in a field goal. On their very next drive, after Josh Jobe improbably ended Josh Allen’s ridiculous interception-less streak, Williams stepped on Geno Smith’s foot on 4th & goal from the one.', 'It wasn’t just him, though— Derrick Hall roughed the passer at the end of the half, leading to a sideline scuffle with Jarran Reed and a Dalton Kincaid touchdown two plays later when the Bills would’ve had 0 or 3 points otherwise. Laviska Shenault dropped a pass that hit him in the chest, Dee Williams fell down while muffing a punt, and the team committed 11 penalties. The vibes were awful from the jump and the Seahawks do not currently appear to be mature enough to counter-act negative momentum.', 'The final score almost doesn’t matter— if I didn’t see a single scoring play you could tell me it was 48-7 and I would have believed you. Bad effort, bad football, 4-4.', '—', 'SMOKE RINGS', '~Geno Smith was not great today but he really wasn’t as bad as you’d think looking at the scoreboard. The NFL’s leading passer completed 72% of his 29 passes for 212 yards but with no touchdowns and a tipped interception in a three-score loss, that will get lost in the flotsam. Don’t hear what I’m not saying— Geno was not great today. But without his best weapon, in the rain, on a day with no run game against a very good defense, Smith wasn’t the problem. Unfortunately there is a discouraging percentage of you reading this looking for reasons to believe Geno Smith isn’t good and at this point, I’m just willing to let you drown. If you believe there are easily-attainable QBs that would have won this game instead, I’m happy to continue letting you write letters to Santa.', 'You guys are constantly hearing me talk about zooming out and unless your comfort zone is shitting on the team, today is a great time to do exactly that. Taken on the whole, Smith is #1 in yards and #5 in completion percentage behind a line that ranks 30th in pressure rate allowed. If you want to spend this time being mad, I can’t tell you anything to change your mind. And for those of you who lack the ability to process context and think I’m just glazing Geno, I will simply say again that he leads the NFL in yards while ranking 5th in completion percentage behind the 3rd worst O-line at preventing pressure. Could he have been better today? Certainly. Should he have been better? Most probably. Should he be judged as a quarterback based on today’s performance? Go ask 3-5 Joe Burrow.', '~Ken Walker needed to be excellent today and given how bad the line and game script were, I’m not sure he could’ve. But that doesn’t change the fact that he wasn’t. One of football’s most explosive runners never got started today, tallying just 12 yards on nine carries while adding 33 on four checkdown receptions. If Seattle was going to win this game, they needed to do it on the ground and they couldn’t have been worse at doing so.', '~Zach Charbonnet cleaned things up in garbage time and was the lone Seahawk to score a touchdown. He had four yards on three carries. Run game fucking sucked.', '~This game is dedicated to the “trade DK Metcalf” crowd. Argue with your mom. With no field-stretching threat to worry about, opposing safeties didn’t need to shade to one side of the field for the first time all season and the results were palpable. Jaxon Smith-Njigba salvaged six catches for 69 yards to lead the way but most of them were inconsequential. He’s a good player and within the context of today, played well. But y’all just saw what this team looks like without a game-wrecker that demands the type of gravity that alters defensive game-plans.', '~Tyler Lockett had one catch for nine yards on three targets.', '~The offensive line continues to struggle. No push in the run game, decent-at-best pass protection, and absolute anarchy from the center position in the game’s highest-leverage situations. Not much else to say here. Hurry back, Abe Lucas— and stop fucking up simple shit, Connor Williams.', '~This is normally the part of this column where I point out the defensive players who made an impact but if I tried to do that today, y’all would know I’m lying. The Bills averaged 6.5 yards per play en route to 445 total yards and 31 points while going 9-16 on 3rd and 4th downs. Bad tackling, missed assignments, etc etc.', '—', 'Listen, good teams have bad games every once in a while— look no further than the Baltimore Ravens losing to the Cleveland Browns today— but bad teams have them a lot. And this makes four bad games in the last five weeks for the Seahawks. Now, I don’t think Seattle is bad per se, but they’re definitely not good. At least not right now.', 'You’ve heard me say it before but the NFL has a way of sucking our opinions into the most recent outcome but the reality of success at the highest level of football is so much broader than that. As you know, my goal is always to have the most accurate view of this team as possible and right now I think the most accurate view is that the Seahawks are a talented but deeply flawed team and the half of that statement we choose to focus on says more about us than it does about the team. Because at the end of the day, that same statement describes the bulk of franchises in the NFL— especially this year.', 'If we’re able to step back, 4-4 feels about right. This week will be the biggest test of Mike Macdonald’s fledgling head coaching career, heading into a game against a Los Angeles Rams team whose vibes are off the charts after the return of Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua led to a huge win over the Minnesota Vikings.', 'It’s been eight games since this franchise made the difficult decision to shift the culture from the biggest coaching icon in Seattle sports history. 4-4 is fine. Am I disappointed with today’s performance? Absolutely. It was absolute garbage. But they were excellent a week ago and not to belabor the point, that’s simply the reality in the NFL. One thing I’m not going to do is excessively elevate or denigrate this team halfway into the first season of a new era.', 'Today sucked. Today is not tomorrow. I know 5% of you are crouched in the starting blocks ready to argue in the comments and honestly, have at it.

OPINION: Capaccio: Arrow Up/Arrow Down: Bills at Seahawks,https://www.audacy.com/wgr550/sports/bills/capaccio-arrow-up-arrow-down-bills-at-seahawks,"['Seattle, Washington (WGR550) - The Buffalo Bills improved to 6-2 on the season with a dominating 31-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks.', 'Here are my Arrows Up and Arrows Down from the game:', 'ARROW UP', 'OC Joe Brady', 'Brady put together an excellent game plan, attacking the Seahawks right away and changing up their run-on-first-down tendency.  Three of the Bills’ first six first down plays were passes, including one on first-and-goal from the Seattle five yard line.  At the end of the game the Bills had 34 rushing and 34 passing attempts. They kept the Seahawks off balance all game.', 'DC Bobby Babich', 'Babich deserves the same credit as Brady for the defensive game plan.  The Bills smothered the Seahawks all afternoon, allowing just 96 yards in the first half, and 233 overall - a bunch of which was near the end of the game when the Bills were sacrificing yards for time.  Buffalo’s defense was credited with five tackles behind the line of scrimmage, creating a lot of long-yardage situations for the Seahawks.', 'QB Josh Allen', 'Despite throwing his first interception of the season, Allen was dialed-in from the start, completing 24-of-34 (75%) passes for 283 yards and a pair of touchdowns.  He added 25 yards rushing for a total of 308 yards of offense.', 'WR Khalil Shakir', 'It’s no surprise that Shakir was one of Allen‘s favorite targets all afternoon. He caught nine of ten balls thrown his way for 107 yards.', 'RB James Cook', 'Cook was the best version of himself, running for 111 yards on 17 carries, an average of 6.5 yards per run. A lot of his yards came after initially hitting the hole and bouncing to an open area. He was seeing the field really well.

He batted a pass down on the first play of the game, finishing with two pass breakups, a quarterback hit, and four total tackles, indulging two for loss.', 'DT Austin Johnson interception', 'Johnson collected his first interception ever, at any level of football, when he was in the right spot at the right time to pick off a pass from Geno Smith as the Seahawks had the ball in Bills territory.  That pick led to a Bills touchdown.', 'The tight ends', 'We finally saw a game where both Bills’ tight ends had big contributions in the passing game.  Dalton Kincaid caught four passes for 31 yards and a touchdown, and Dawson Knox caught a pair of passes for 50 yards.', 'P Sam Martin and punt coverage unit', 'Martin only punted three times, but he connected for a 58-yarder, placed one perfectly out of bounds at the Seattle 9-yard line, and averaged 49.0 per punt. The Seahawks not only had zero return yards, but the Bills coverage team also recovered a muffed punt.', 'Run defense!', 'The Bills run defense really stepped up and had its best game of the season.  Seattle ran the ball 17 times for only 43 yards, averaging just 1.9 yards per carry.', 'The trenches', 'The Bills controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball.  Not only did they hold the Seahawks to just 32 yards rushing, they ran for 164 yards themselves, Josh Allen was sacked just once, and the Seattle defense was credited with no quarterback hits on the day.', 'Third down offense and defense', 'The Bills were excellent on third downs on both sides of the ball, converting 8-of-15 (53.3%) on offense and holding the Seahawks to just 1-of-7 (14.3%).', 'Red zone offense and defense', 'The Bills converted four of their six red zone trips into touchdowns (67%).  They held the Seahawks to just 1-for-3 converting TDs (33%) once they entered the Bills’ 20-yard line.', 'Closing it out', 'The Bills held a 24-3 lead late in the third quarter.  On the next Seattle series, they forced a three-and-out, then took the ball and drove 73 yards in 7 plays, essentially icing the game.', 'BillsMafia', 'It was an incredible showing by Bills fans in Seattle.  Lumen Field was packed with them and they made their voices heard throughout the contest.', '—————————————————————————————————————', 'ARROW DOWN', 'PR Brandon Codrington fielding punt in first quarter', 'After the Seahawks second drive and the Bills forcing another three-and-out, Seattle punted. Returner Brandon Codrington was on his heels and backpedaled all the way back to the goal line. Instead of letting the ball go into the end zone, he caught it and returned it, getting only to the 12-yard line. The Bills eventually punted from their own 42. He needs to make a better decision there.', 'Penalties', '24 total assessed penalties in the game on both teams.  32 total flags thrown (by our count, unofficially). There were definitely some ticky-tack calls, but the Bills really hurt themselves with 13 of those penalties totaling 85 yards.

They'll need to build on that performance against a Bills team that just hung 389 yards and 34 unanswered points on the NFL's top-ranked defense. Unlike Atlanta, which has been generous with the football this season, Buffalo ranks first in giveaways (two) and second in turnover margin (+10).

Smith began the day as the NFL’s leading passer, but after three quarters he had only 123 yards before piling up some big garbage time yardage after the Bills extended their lead to 31-3 with 11:19 left to play.', '“It’s up there,” Allen said when he was asked if this was Buffalo’s best performance. “I think you look at it from all three phases, I think everybody went out there, knew their job and executed at a high level - offense, defense and special teams. We’ll watch this one, get rid of it and enjoy the plane ride.”', 'Here are a few of my observations:', 'Allen had gone 203 consecutive passes to start the season without an interception until early in the second quarter when he simply threw one right to practice squad call up Josh Jobe as he tried to hit Amari Cooper on a quick slant. The streak actually was 300 passes dating back to the regular-season finale in Miami last year, and encompassed the two playoff games.', 'However, after Jobe returned the pick to the 7-yard-line, one of the game’s biggest moments occurred and it flipped the game in Buffalo’s favor for the rest of the afternoon.', 'The Seahawks ran Kenneth Walker for three yards, then Zach Charbonnet for three, putting the ball at the 1, and on third-and-goal, Dorian Williams and Greg Rousseau stuffed Walker for no gain.', 'Here, Seattle decided to go for the tying touchdown, but Smith tripped over his center’s foot, fell to the ground, and Rousseau touched him down at 7 for a big turnover on downs.', '“Huge,” Allen said. “Hate throwing turnovers, but made the tackle. And coach talks about it all the time with something like that, not to put your head down, go make atackle and let your defense come back on the field because you never know what’s going to happen. They went out there and had four consecutive plays of a stop.”', 'From there, the Bills marched 93 yards in 12 plays to take a 14-3 lead which obviously was a seismic shift in the game script.', 'Allen was great as he completed 24 of 34 on a rainy day for 283 yards and two TDs, one to Keon Coleman (five catches, 70 yards) and one to Dalton Kincaid (4-31).', 'Shakir is so vitally important to the Bills’ passing game, to the point where he’s an irreplaceable player. All you need to do is look how terribly Allen struggled in the game Shakir missed in Houston. Without his most reliable receiver, he had one of the worst games of his career when he completed just 9 of 30 passes.', 'The easy comparison to make in terms of recent Bills history Shakir being the new Cole Beasley, a small, quick receiver who just knew how to get open, especially against zone coverage.', 'But here’s the difference: Beasley would make a catch and then was unable to pile up yards after the catch because he so often went down on first contact. Shakir makes catches and he has the ability to either elude tacklers or bounce off first contact to find additional yardage.', 'Part of this is also attributable to Allen’s better ball placement. When Beasley was here that wasn’t a strength of the Allen’s, but now he’s much better at giving his receivers the ball in spots where they can do something with it in their hands and Shakir is the best on the team at taking advantage of that.', '“Cole was a phenomenal player in his own right,” McDermott said. “He did a lot of great things for this team. Khalil is his own player. What you saw the last couple of weeks with Khalil was he was out there playing injured and finally, this week, I think he started to get back to closer to 100 percent.”', 'He made two catches for 17 yards on the Bills’ first TD drive, and then two for 24 on the second TD drive. After his 35-yard catch and run early in the third quarter which helped set up Tyler Bass’ field goal for a 17-3 lead, he had seven catches on seven targets for 93 yards, and he ended the day with nine for 107 yards. The only target he didn’t catch came in the fourth quarter, and that’s because the pass was batted at the line of scrimmage.', 'The Bills won this game in spite of themselves. It was a dumpster fire in the penalty department, particularly for the offensive line.', 'Alec Anderson had a holding call, David Edwards had a false start, and Connor McGovern had a hold, all of that on the first drive of the game, yet the Bills still found a way to drive 91 yards and get the ball in the end zone. Later in the first quarter, Dion Dawkins had a false start, and he had another in the fourth.', 'On the first possession of the third quarter, Spencer Brown had a holding penalty on the first play, and later had one that was declined because it was fourth down. And then on Seattle’s first possession of the third, they would have been facing a quick third-and-10 but Christian Benford gifted them a first down with an illegal contact penalty.', '“We were able to run the football, we were able to throw the football, protect, but again, we just kill ourselves with penalties,” Edwards said. “That’s one thing we got to really clean up moving forward if we want to be the team we want to be.”', 'By game’s end, the Bills were flagged 13 times for 85 yards. Not that the Seahawks were much better as referee Ron Torbert’s crew was all over them, too, calling 11 for 82 yards. This didn’t include several occasions where penalties offset. The 24 combined penalties were the most in the league this year. The previous high was 22 in the Bills-Jets game three weeks ago.', 'It was one of these NFL games where the officials are simply too much a part of the game. Sure, some of the calls were definitely penalties, but there was also plenty of ticky-tack stuff that mars the NFL every week.', 'Here’s a sentence I never thought I’d type: Defensive tackle Austin Johnson made an interception. Yeah, that was pretty crazy, and not surprisingly, it was the eighth-year veteran’s first of his career, in his 123rd NFL game.', '“It’s an awesome moment to get that checked off the list,” Johnson said. “I’ve had a scoop and score for a touchdown in college, but never an interception, so that was cool.”', 'The Seahawks were on the move midway through the third quarter trailing just 17-3 and looking to get within one score. Smith dropped to pass and got pressured immediately by AJ Epenesa from his left. He tried to get rid of the ball with a throw in the middle of the field intended for Kenneth Walker, but Casey Toohill tipped it and it caromed right into Johnson’s belly to kill Seattle’s attempt to get back into the game.', ""Asked what his thought was when the ball was suddenly coming his way, Johnson laughed and said, “Catch it! When you get those opportunities, you've got to definitely take advantage of them. If there was no one in front of me, I would have ran. … If you've got a ton of people around you and the offense is rolling and doing an amazing job like they are, I'm just trying to get the ball back to the offense and let them keep on doing their thing. They had an amazing day.”"", 'The Bills took possession at their own 49 with 5:59 remaining, and four minutes later, Cook scooted around left end for a two-yard touchdown and at 24-3, the game was essentially over.', 'Without Metcalf, the Seahawks wanted to get Walker going in the run game because he’s one of the best in the NFL, and he has the kind of speed to the edge that might have given the Bills’ defense, playing without linebacker Terrel Bernard.', 'But Walker was never a factor. He was stuffed on the two big plays near the goal line, and thereafter was barely involved. He finished with 12 yards on nine carries. It was the second-lowest total of his 36-game NFL career.', '“Really good running back,” McDermott said. “He likes to get outside and you could tell when they didn’t have him in the stretch of two or three games … you could see a difference in their offense. So we knew that they were going to challenge the line of scrimmage, and they did and they did it early, and we were able to snuff it out a little bit there, which helps to make them more of a one-dimensional.”', 'It was by far the Bills’ best run defense performance of the season as Seattle finished with a mere 32 yards on 17 attempts with 16 coming on five Smith scrambles.', 'Sal Maiorana has covered the Buffalo Bills for four decades including 35 years as the full-time beat writer for the D&C, and he has written numerous books about the history of the team.
