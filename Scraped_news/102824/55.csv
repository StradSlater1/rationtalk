The Chiefs' defense should have a major advantage over a struggling Las Vegas offense."", 'Chiefs player to watch', 'DT Chris Jones. Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said his team can‘t rely on just one blocker to keep Jones out of Las Vegas’ backfield, a testament to how dominant the 30-year-old remains. “This guy is playing at that MVP level — defensive MVP level,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “He takes a lot of pride in being the best and right now he’s doing that, he’s showing that.”', 'DE Maxx Crosby. He finally appears to be fully healthy after playing through a high ankle sprain. Even while playing through pain, Crosby has made at least half a sack in every game but one this season.

He also has had notable interactions with Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, as shown in the Netflix docuseries “Quarterback.”', 'Chiefs offensive line vs. Raiders defensive front. Pro Football Focus ranks Kansas City’s offensive line as the NFL’s third best, noting it had a particularly strong run-blocking performance Sunday’s victory over the 49ers. The Raiders have had a series of issues on their line — DT Christian Wilkins is on injured reserve and DE Malcolm Koonce is out for the season. That puts extra pressure on Crosby, LB Robert Spillane and others to pick up the slack.', 'Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster (hamstring) and DE Mike Danna (pectoral) will not play. Raiders WR Jakobi Meyers (ankle) is questionable after missing the past two games, but coach Antonio Pierce said he believed he would play. G Dylan Parham (foot) will be out for the second game in a row.

The Chiefs improved to 6-0 at Allegiant Stadium, a record that includes their win in Super Bowl 58 in February.', 'Kansas City (7-0) has won 17 of its last 20 meetings with the Raiders (2-6).', 'Sunday’s game was still close well into the second half. The Raiders began a drive at the Chiefs’ 3-yard line trailing 17-13 in the third quarter after safety Tre’von Moehrig picked off quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Their offense then lost five yards on four plays and turned the ball over on downs.', 'Kansas City proceeded to kick a field goal the next drive, then added on a touchdown after quarterback Gardner Minshew lost a fumble. That put the Chiefs up 27-13 with 4:59 remaining. The Raiders did get a touchdown from wide receiver DJ Turner with 2:03 left, but Kansas City recovered the ensuing onside kick.', 'Minshew completed 24 of 30 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns.

Meyers, back on the field after missing two games with an ankle injury, converted on third down with an 11-yard reception.', 'The Raiders kept moving the ball with a Turner run for four yards and a catch by wide receiver Tre Tucker for 20. Two Mattison runs for three yards and an 8-yard catch by rookie tight end Brock Bowers then got the team into the red zone at the Kansas City 19-yard line.', 'A 7-yard run by Turner and a 3-yard carry by Mattison set the Raiders up with a first-and-goal at the 9. A run by running back Zamir White for two yards then led to a 7-yard touchdown pass from Minshew to Meyers.', 'Minshew completed all five of his passes on the possession for 53 yards. The Raiders’ main issue has been sustaining their early offensive success.', 'They didn’t score another touchdown until Turner’s at the end of the fourth quarter.', '3. Questionable decisions', 'Pierce has been criticized for his game management during his Raiders’ tenure, and he opened himself up for more questions Sunday.', 'Many of them will surround the end of the first half.', 'The Chiefs had a third-and-goal from the 5-yard line after the two-minute warning and the Raiders used one of their remaining two timeouts on defense. It didn’t help. Kansas City scored on its next play to go up 14-10 thanks to a Mahomes pass to tight end Travis Kelce.', 'That left the Raiders with just one timeout when they got the ball back on offense with 1:57 left in the half. They elected to go conservative rather than attempt to take the lead.', 'The Raiders threw a short pass to Meyers for no gain and then huddled, allowing 40 seconds to run off the clock. Running back Ameer Abdullah gained just two yards on second down, leading the Chiefs to call a timeout with 1:11 remaining.', 'Kansas City forced an incomplete pass, got the ball back and marched 56 yards to set up a 42-yard field goal for kicker Harrison Butker to go up 17-10 at halftime.', 'That wasn’t the only sequence where Pierce will come under scrutiny.', 'The Raiders had a fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line in the third quarter trailing 17-13.

That\'s obviously something we have to be better at,"" Gardner Minshew II said of the lack of red zone success. ""We\'ve been getting down there a few times, the defense put us down there a couple times.

I have to look at it, figure out what we\'ve done well over the last little bit and figure out what\'s not working and go from there.""', 'With the Raiders on the three-yard line in hopes of taking a 20-17 lead, they were stopped behind the line of scrimmage on four straight plays.', '""Ball at the three-yard line, gotta punch it in, right?"" Pierce said. ""Last week [against the Rams], we had the same opportunity and we threw it four times.""', 'Another stagnant attack in the running game also played a role in the defeat. After averaging nearly 112 rushing yards in their previous four games heading into Week 8, the Silver and Black rushed for just 33 yards in Allegiant Stadium against the Chiefs – averaging less than two yards per carry for the second time this season.', '""Trying to establish some physicality with our guys up front,"" Pierce said.

After their 27-20 victory over the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, Kansas City stands at 7-0 on the season — and has tied its franchise record with a 13-game winning streak.', 'The Chiefs got right to work, cranking out a nine-play, 70-yard drive that included a 13-yard pass to newly-acquired wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins (and a 25-yard pass to tight end Travis Kelce) and ended with running back Kareem Hunt giving the Chiefs a 7-0 lead with a one-yard touchdown run.', 'The Raiders didn’t waste time, either. They responded with a 70-yard drive of their own that featured a 20-yard pass to wideout Tre Tucker. Quarterback Gardner Minshew found wide receiver Jakobi Meyers for a 7-yard score that tied the game 7-7.', 'The Chiefs got to midfield with a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Justin Watson — but two plays later, Las Vegas sacked quarterback Patrick Mahomes to force a punt that gave the Raiders the ball at their own 14-yard line. They drove past midfield before defensive end George Karlaftis batted down a third-and-11 pass. That forced a 54-yard field goal, giving Las Vegas a 10-7 lead.', 'The Chiefs took 8:16 off the clock on their next drive, running 13 plays that came to an end with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Kelce — his first of the season and 75th in his career — giving the Chiefs a 14-10 lead with 1:57 left in the half. The defense forced a three-and-out, giving Kansas City the ball at their 25-yard line with 58 seconds left. Mahomes’ 16-yard pass to Hopkins pushed Mahomes past 30,000 career yards — and set up a 42-yard field goal that gave the Chiefs a 17-10 halftime lead.', 'The teams exchanged three-and-outs to open the third quarter — and a personal foul on Joshua Williams extended a 17-yard Las Vegas punt return to the Kansas City 28-yard line. After two false-start penalties, the Chiefs’ defense had held on third down at the 8-yard line — but a holding penalty gave the Raiders a new set of downs at the Kansas City 4-yard line. The defense held again, forcing a 14-yard field goal that made the score 17-13.', 'An excellent kickoff forced the Chiefs into a bad return — and a penalty started the Kansas City drive at the 8-yard line. Back-to-back holding penalties on Wanya Morris had the Chiefs at first-and-16 at their 2-yard line — and then the Raiders deflected (and intercepted) a pass, getting the ball at the 3-yard line. The Kansas City defense sacked Mishew on fourth-and-8, getting the ball back right here they’d had it.', 'The Chiefs engineered a 19-play drive that went 87 yards (consuming 9:43 of the clock), including three third-down plays that Mahomes converted with scrambles. But Las Vegas finally held at its 5-yard line.

It shows the support that we have and have gotten throughout my entire career.”', 'The roar for every big play Kansas City during a 27-20 victory, which moved the Chiefs to 7-0, made rivaled cheers for the hometown team.', '“I don’t take it for granted, because it costs money to travel, it costs money to come to games and people want to show that they support us,” Mahomes said. “We’re going to show the same support to them when we’re in the community.”', 'The crowds are a reflection of the trajectory of the two franchises in the last five years in some ways, but the Chiefs sure don’t seem to mind.', '“I appreciate our fans and the support that we had from them today,” coach Andy Reid said. “It’s always good when you go on the road and you’re able to have all that red up there.”', 'Clad in red or donning the silver and black, the fans inside Allegiant were treated to a chippy affair worthy of Chiefs-Raiders glory days.', '“It’s a rivalry,” Mahomes said. “It goes back further than anyone on that football field. No matter what the records are, when you come into this football game, you know it’s going to be a fight. You know it’s going to be a fight every single snap.”', 'Including the playoffs, Kansas City has won a franchise-record 13 consecutive games. The last loss came on Christmas Day last season against Las Vegas, but the Chiefs answered the bell against a feisty Raiders squad.', '“Their head coach likes to play us,” Reid said. “Those guys, they get fired up and I’m glad our guys were able to answer it.”', 'The Chiefs have never lost at Allegiant. They are now 5-0 against the Raiders since the stadium opened in 2020, winning by an average of 12.6 points per game, and also beat San Francisco there during Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024.', '—', 'Report a typo']"

He lost two yards on third down — and then on fourth down, defensive end George Karlaftis essentially rushed his man into quarterback Gardner Minshew to share the sack with Turk Wharton.', 'As Spagnuolo will likely mention when he speaks to the media on Friday, there is a lot to clean up. I joked about the opening drive; the second-level coverage wasn’t good, and it’s unclear if Kansas City has an ample cornerback replacement for Jaylen Watson (and now Nazeeh Johnson) — but on Sunday night, he should smile.', 'The Chiefs won’t be happy about surrendering 20 points to the Raiders, but the goal-line stand likely saved the afternoon.', 'Tight end Travis Kelce had a vintage performance against the Raiders, catching 10 passes for 90 yards and a touchdown. We haven’t seen it as much this season, but Sunday showed that Kelce can still be Mahomes’ go-to target whenever necessary. All afternoon, Las Vegas had no answer for the veteran tight end.', 'Kelce’s score was his 12th against the Raiders’ organization. He has more touchdowns against the Raiders than any other NFL team.', 'Acquired less than a week ago, Hopkins provided a promising glimpse of what’s to come. His two catches both went for first downs — and showed that in a matter of days, he’s earned Mahomes’ trust.', 'In sports, there are often feelings of what-if. One that remember is when franchise legend Jamaal Charles signed his one-day contract to retire as a Chief. Mahomes gave him a ceremonial handoff.', 'In my opinion, Kelce seeing the same field with a go-up-and-get-it wide receiver such as Hopkins falls into the same category. It’s a move that certainly would have been sweeter (and, in the long run, more fruitful) if it happened two years ago. But salary cap constraints made it impossible at the time.', 'Well... better late than never.', 'The goal-line stand proved to be the series that turned the tide — but throughout the game, a number of critical third-down plays kept the Chiefs on the path to victory.', 'On Kansas City’s first drive that ended in a score, running back Samaje Perine took a third-down screen 21 yards down the field. Kalaftis’ third-down knockdown in the second quarter held the Raiders to a field goal.', 'In the touchdown drive to follow, wide receiver Xavier Worthy kept the drive alive with a great route and catch on third down. Six plays later, tight end Noah Gray delivered on third down — and then made an even better catch on a third down that followed the goal-line stand, when he corraled a pass that went through Worthy’s hands.', 'Mahomes may not have had the passing day we all anticipated, but he had two key third-down scrambles to keep drives going. As a team, Kansas City finished 12 of 16 on third down, which proved the difference in a win over a grittier-than-expected Raiders effort.', 'The Chiefs had some concerning issues with protection and penalties, but they found a way to overcome those problems on Sunday. That buys time to address them in the week ahead. And with “Monday Night Football” next on the schedule, they’ll have an extra day to do so.', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

That usually means they will play, but it still signals limitations for the passing attack in particular. The bye week was big for getting the Chargers healthy, and a weak Saints team will allow them to keep pace with the Broncos for second place in the division.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

That ties the franchise record set in 2020.', 'The Raiders won the opening coin toss, and deferred the decision of possession to the second half. That set the Chiefs up to begin on offense, starting from the 30-yard line after a touchback.', 'The Chiefs’ offense immediately ran into third down on the first drive, but newly-acquired wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins hooked up with quarterback Patrick Mahomes to move the chains. The 13-yard completion was followed by a big gain through the air for tight end Travis Kelce. When Kansas City faced another third down, running back Samaje Perine converted by taking a short pass for 21 yards, down to the Raiders’ three-yard line.', 'After one stuffed handoff, running back Kareem Hunt punched in another on second and goal, giving the Chiefs an initial 7-0 lead after the opening drive.', 'Las Vegas went backwards to start their initial possession by way of a false start. That helped put them in third down, but Raiders’ quarterback Gardner Minshew converted by finding wide receiver Jakobi Meyers over the middle. The Raiders advanced into Chiefs’ territory with a 20-yard catch and run, setting up at the 30-yard line.', 'The Chiefs’ run defense put the Raiders into third down after defending two runs, but rookie tight end Brock Bowers converted with a catch at the marker.

Safety Justin Reid contested a jump ball to Meyers on second and goal, but Meyers completed the catch, tying the score at 7-7.', 'Mahomes got the Chiefs’ second drive going with a 19-yard completion to wide receiver Justin Watson. A few plays later, left tackle Wanya Morris gave way to outside pressure, resulting in a drive-ending sack. The Chiefs had to punt back to the Raiders.', 'A highlight play by Bowers got the Raiders started on their second possession, catching a contested pass over cornerback Trent McDuffie for 19 yards. That set up Las Vegas at their own 36-yard line at the end of the first quarter.', 'Chiefs’ linebacker Drue Tranquill took advantage of pressure from the defensive front to earn a sack on the first play of the second period. That pushed the Raiders into third down, but it was successful conversion thanks to another strong play by Bowers. On the next play, Meyers found space for a 17-yard gain after the catch, entering Kansas City territory.', 'From the Chiefs’ 34-yard line, the Raiders lost yardage over first and second down. On third down, a throw was batted down by defensive end George Karlaftis. That forced the Raiders to settle for a long field goal, but the kick was good, giving Las Vegas a 10-7 lead early in the second quarter.', 'Rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy was featured to get the next possession going, gaining 12 yards over two short passes to move the chains. Then it was Kelce’s turn to move the chains over two consecutive plays, gaining 19 yards over two catches, including a shovel pass that finished at the Raiders’ 36-yard line.', 'A penalty for illegal formation set the Chiefs back, but it was overcome with a flip pass by Mahomes on third down. The flick of the wrist went to tight end Noah Gray, who went down just outside of the red zone. A check down to Hunt moved the chains and set up the Chiefs in goal to go. The offense got to the five-yard line for third and goal when the two-minute warning hit.', 'Looking to finish the drive, the Chiefs aligned in a set with three tights ends — and Kelce came open over the middle to score. Kelce’s first touchdown of the season gave the Chiefs a 14-10 advantage with little time left int he first half.', 'In the two-minute drill, the Raiders were shut down by the Chiefs’ defense. Defensive tackle Chris Jones was all over a short pass, then cornerback Trent McDuffie blitzed and caused an incompletion on third down. That forced the Raiders to punt back to the Chiefs with under a minute left in the quarter.', 'The Chiefs’ attempt to get into range for a field goal nearly went bad when a lateral attempt by Kelce to Perine fell to the turf. It was recovered — and Mahomes found Worthy downfield for 16 yards two plays later. From the Raiders’ 40-yard line, Mahomes spiked the ball to stop the clock. Then, he found Hopkins on the sideline at the 24-yard line with seven seconds left.', 'That set up the Chiefs to kick a field goal, and it went through the uprights. That gave the Chiefs a 17-10 lead going into halftime.', 'The Raiders started the second half with possession, but quickly faced third down after two stuffed runs. Needing nine yards, Minshew unloaded deep, but the pass was incomplete thanks to a blitz by rookie cornerback Christan Roland-Wallace. That led to a punt; a strong return by wide receiver Mecole Hardman was negated by a penalty on rookie safety Jaden Hicks.', 'From their own eight-yard line, the Chiefs were unable to dig themselves out of the hole. A shorted pass to Kelce was incomplete on second down, then a deep pass to Worthy fell to the ground. Kansas City had to punt back to the Raiders, and the return went all the way to the Chiefs’ 28-yard line due to a penalty.', 'The Chiefs’ defense did its best to stifle the Raiders with good field position, but the Raiders hurt themselves with two false-start penalties. On third down, cornerback Joshua Williams drew a penalty for defensive holding, allowing Las Vegas to convert. Chris Jones blew up a run play for a four-yard loss on the ensuing snap, leading to another third down, but Minshew found Meyers to move the chains.', 'With first and goal from the four-yard line, the Chiefs destroyed another first-down run when Tranquill made a tackle for loss. After Justin Reid made a tackle at the line of scrimmage on second down, Karlaftis pursued Minshew and corralled him for a sack on third down. The Raiders kicked a field goal to tighten the score to 17-13.', 'Left tackle Wanya Morris was called for holding penalties on back-to-back snaps to start the Chiefs’ drive, which set them back to their own two-yard line. Needing 16 yards to move the chains, Mahomes dropped back on first down, and threw an interception that was returned to the three-yard line.', 'The Chiefs stepped up in the goal-line situation. The defense stuffed two runs, then tackled running back Alexander Mattison for a two-yard loss on third down. The Raiders attempted to score a touchdown on fourth down, but the Chiefs’ defensive line swarmed Minshew and was sacked by both Karlaftis and defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton, stopping the scoring opportunity.', 'Needing to sustain a drive starting from the eight-yard line, the Chiefs stuck to the ground game, including a two-yard scramble by Mahomes on third and one. Two more runs set up another third down, and that was converted with a throw to tight end Noah Gray. That put the Chiefs at their own 26-yard line as the third quarter ended.', 'The Chiefs continued pounding the rock to advance the ball, but a third penalty for holding was called on left tackle Wanya Morris. That pushed the Chiefs back into third and long, but Mahomes overcame it with a long scramble to sneak past the sticks and into Raiders’ territory.', 'The next third down faced by the Chiefs was converted with a pass over the middle to Kelce, who gained 16 yards and got into the red zone. A penalty for roughing the passer pushed the Chiefs to the seven-yard line. The Chiefs went into passing mode from there, and could not get into the end zone. The offense left the field and made way for a field goal, giving the Chiefs a 20-13 lead with eight minutes left in the game.', 'The Raiders looked to answer the Chiefs’ score, but Minshew fumbled as he scrambled, leading to a turnover and Kansas City getting the ball at the Raiders’ 37-yard line.', 'The Chiefs’ run game used three plays to move the chains, chewing up clock with roughly six minutes left. Facing third down, the Chiefs looked to Kelce to move the chains, advancing to the eight-yard line. On second and goal, Mahomes rolled left and found Worthy running open and into the end zone. That extended the Chiefs’ lead to 27-13 with less than five minutes to go.', 'Needing to score quickly, the Raiders worked down the field with chunk plays, advancing into Kansas City territory and converting a fourth down to the 26-yard line. Two quick passes got the Raiders to the Chiefs’ 11-yard line with just over two minutes left. A pass from Minshew scored, tightening the Chiefs’ lead to 27-20.', 'The attempt to onside kick failed; Noah Gray fielded the ball and gave the Chiefs possession.

Raiders-Chiefs: What’s going on with Patrick Mahomes?,https://www.silverandblackpride.com/2024/10/25/24279616/raiders-chiefs-week-8-preview-patrick-mahomes,"['FILED UNDER:', '5 questions with Arrowhead Pride', 'Week 8 in the NFL features a classic rivalry game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs. To preview the matchup, Jared Sapp from our friends at Arrowhead Pride was kind enough to answer a few questions about the Chiefs for Raider Nation.', 'Q: It seems like Patrick Mahomes has been having the worst season of his career as he has thrown more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (six) so far. What’s been the difference between Mahomes this year and in years past? Or has it not been as bad as it seems from afar?', 'A: I think most Chiefs fans will be honest, Mahomes made some really terrible throws in the first four games that turned into ugly interceptions or otherwise kept points off of the board. The three interceptions he has thrown in the last two games have been more a case of bad luck, but they will still count on his stats.', 'It’s hard to complain about a 6-0 team, but one also has to be concerned about what we are seeing. Two issues are greatly affecting what he is doing on the field. He does not fully trust the team’s tackle situation where two young players have rotated in protecting his blindside. Injuries in the wide receiver room have also zapped the Chiefs offense of much of its juice, and the completions he needs to make just aren’t there.', 'Hopefully, as DeAndre Hopkins is worked into the offense, Mahomes and the Chiefs can at least get into a rhythm. The monster stats of years past probably aren’t coming back, but the offense should be able to resemble the level that has delivered two Super Bowls.', 'Ultimately, what happens in the postseason is the only thing this year will be judged on. Mahomes will have plenty of future seasons to pad his Hall of Fame counting numbers.', 'Q: Xavier Worthy had an impressive debut on national television during the season opener, but it seems like he’s been pretty quiet since then. What have you seen from the rookie, and what has he brought to the offense so far?', 'A: Worthy honestly might be a victim of his own success as far as stats. Since he scored a 54-yard touchdown against the Chargers, respect for his speed has allowed the Chiefs to do whatever they have wanted in the run game for ten quarters.', 'There have been some encouraging signs. His speed is obvious. Concerns about his size have been somewhat alleviated by his quick recovery from a big hit last week. Besides the monster touchdown against the Chargers, Worthy also iced the game with a drag route that looked like it was run by a veteran.', 'There have been a few concerns. He fell down on a route against the 49ers, leading directly to one of Mahomes’ two interceptions. His size has left him vulnerable to press, and despite his speed, he has been unable to recover multiple times when forced off of his planned route. The two have also had some difficulty connecting downfield.', 'There is plenty of time to get those details right. But as long as the Chiefs are seeing light boxes, I expect them to be a run-first team for as long as they can swing it.', 'Q: Kansas City traded away L’Jarius Sneed in the offseason and Jaylen Watson suffered a broken ankle last Sunday that could put Watson out for the year. So, how has the secondary looked this season and who is the next man up after Watson’s injury?', 'A: Watson’s injury is very unfortunate because he was having an outstanding season and proving to be an all-time great seventh-round find.', 'Joshua Williams and Nazeeh Johnson will get their chance to step up. They have both had good moments in their young careers, but neither has shown signs of being the consistent starter Watson had become. Struggling against Minshew and company could make cornerback a late need at the trade deadline.', 'The secondary has played outstanding against opposing wide receivers. Trent McDuffie might be playing like the best cornerback in the league. Safety play against tight ends has left something to be desired, and I have some concerns about Justin Reid and Bryan Cook matching up with Brock Bowers.', ""The Chiefs' pass rush has made life easier for the defensive backs, and that will hopefully continue with Charles Omenihu likely to return from injured reserve in the coming weeks to reinforce the defensive line."", 'Q: Everyone knows about Chris Jones, but is there another Chief defensive lineman that Raider fans should know about? Maybe someone younger who could be a problem for years to come?', 'A: Raiders fans are probably familiar with George Karlaftis who had the best game of his third season against San Francisco. Felix Anudike-Uzomah has not lived up to his first-round billing so far, but he has played well, if not spectacularly in his second year.', 'RELATED', 'One player to watch is Turk Wharton, who tore his ACL against the Raiders in 2022 at Arrowhead. Wharton has ten pressures on the season and has really come on now in his second year following the injury. He is really taking advantage of favorable matchups when Jones is double (or triple) teamed.', 'Q: Most Raider fans have accepted that this season is going nowhere and are looking toward the future. Who are the Chiefs’ notable impending free agents that might be playing elsewhere next season?', 'A: 2021 was the first of three draft classes that have produced multiple starters, meaning this will be the first of several offseasons that may see them make difficult decisions.', 'Kansas City already extended Creed Humphrey from the class, making him the highest-paid center in the league. Nick Bolton and Trey Smith loom large, however. It may be especially difficult to match what Smith is likely to see on the open market given the funds Kansas City has already invested in the offensive line.', 'RELATED', 'The Chiefs are also soon to face a problem they have rarely faced in recent years. The team has not had a first-round pick meriting a large extension after three seasons since Mahomes in 2020. McDuffie and Karlaftis will be eligible for new deals after the season, and they should want to get ahead of the market in locking them up.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

While the games between these division rivals always have some extra spice to them, this Week 8 clash could be even more personal for the defending back-to-back Super Bowl champs, more specifically, Patrick Mahomes.
