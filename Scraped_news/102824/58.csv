Andrea Stella hails ‘consistent’ F1 stewarding with double Max Verstappen penalty,https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1059190/1/andrea-stella-hails-consistent-f1-stewarding-double-max-verstappen-penalty,"[""McLaren's Andrea Stella praises F1's stewards for their handling of Max Verstappen's punishment."", 'McLaren team principal Andrea Stella has hailed F1’s stewards for their “consistent” handling of Max Verstappen’s double penalty at the Mexico City Grand Prix.', 'Reigning world champion Verstappen was given two 10-second penalties for his driving when battling McLaren’s Lando Norris in the same lap during Sunday’s race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.', '', '', 'First, Verstappen forced Norris off track at Turn 4, before doing the same into Turn 7 when he lunged his Red Bull down the inside. The Dutchman recovered to finish sixth, while Norris took second to cut Verstappen’s championship lead down to 47 points with four races remaining.', 'McLaren CEO Zak Brown suggested to Sky Sports after the race that Verstappen’s penalties were “probably not enough”.', 'Asked by Crash.net if he agreed with Brown’s stance, Stella replied: “I did not hear what Zak said about the penalty for Max.', '“In my opinion, and this is a comment that I make straight out of the race, so there may be some more details in terms of looking at the incidents and the interpretation of the incidents, but in my view, the penalties seemed to be consistent with the application of the guidelines and in relation to those kind of incidents.', '""So I think from this point of view, this has been a positive day because it shows that authority exists. It shows that the stewards have done a good job, a good job which surely comes from constant review like we do in any thing in Formula 1, you review and then you improve.', '“To me it looks like this process has happened also in terms of stewarding, in terms of the FIA having taken some feedback constructively on board and we appreciate this. Not as a team but as part of the F1 community, I feel like I have to thank the FIA and the stewards.”', 'Stella believes Norris can take a lot away from the fact he has continued to race Verstappen in a “fair, sporting way”.', '“I think Lando can look at his own racing, often looking at the half-empty glass in relation to what he could do,” Stella explained.', '“Our conversations in our internal reviews have been very clear; Lando we like, we approve, we confirm the way you go racing. It’s not for you to go there and try to find justice yourself.', ""“You go racing in a fair, sporting way like you do and then there needs to be a third party which is the stewarding that will say whether those maneuverers are correct or not. Don’t be desperate, you don't have to prove anything, you go racing fair and square."", '“This is what we want from Lando. This is what Lando wants from himself, and I think it was important that the team kind of confirms that’s what we want from you Lando, that’s how we want to go racing at McLaren and for a driver driving a McLaren car.', ""“That's why it’s a positive day because I think it has proven that it’s good to race hard, but it can’t be resolved on track by the two drivers. It needs a third party, it needs the authority, so we are completely happy with the way Lando has gone racing before."", ""“Any time I’ve read these types of headlines, I maybe need to have a conversation with him and reassure him, ‘don't worry, it will be alright, time is a gentleman’.” "", 'Get the latest F1 news, exclusives, interviews and promotions from the paddock direct to your inbox', 'For more information see our Privacy Policy', '©1999-2024 Crash Media Group', 'The total or partial reproduction of text, photographs or illustrations is not permitted in any form.']"
Norris slams “dangerous” driving as Verstappen gets 20-second penalty,https://www.topgear.com/car-news/formula-one/norris-slams-dangerous-driving-verstappen-gets-20-second-penalty,"['Ooh er, it’s really kicking off now', 'With all the talk before the Mexico City Grand Prix centred on the rights and wrongs of wheel-to-wheel combat, this was destined to happen wasn’t it?', 'Shortly after losing the lead to Carlos Sainz - who was untouchable on his way to Ferrari’s second straight win - Max Verstappen was on the defensive again as Lando Norris surged around the outside of Turn 4 at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.', 'Some would argue too defensive. Unlike in Austin last week Norris made sure he was ahead at the apex, but Verstappen still ran him onto the grass when it looked like the McLaren could’ve made the corner.', 'That put the Briton ahead of the Dutchman, and moments later the three-time champ made a lunge for Turn 8 which took both him and his rival off track, allowing Charles Leclerc to sweep into second place.', 'Lando was… rather displeased. “This guy is dangerous,” he complained to his race engineer over the radio. “I just have to avoid a crash. It’s the same as last time mate. I’ll end up in a wall in a minute.”', 'The stewards seemed to agree. A short while later Max was slapped with a 10-second penalty for the first incident, and then given another 10-second penalty for the second. “10? That’s quite impressive,” said Verstappen. “And how about him then, Turn 4? That’s fine then? That’s silly man.”', '', 'And so Verstappen was forced to wait in his pit box for 20 entire seconds when he made his only pitstop, thus dropping him well out of contention for the podium.', 'Meanwhile Norris, now no longer transfixed on the huge ORACLE ad on the back of the Red Bull, could get the hammer down. For the next 35 laps he slowly chipped away at his 6.5s deficit to Leclerc, until he was right on his gearbox with eight laps to go.', 'The pressure was too much for Leclerc: beginning to struggle on his tyres he had a massive moment in the last corner - somehow catching the car before it was buried in the wall - that cost him P2.', '', 'Get all the latest news, reviews and exclusives, direct to your inbox.', 'Sainz was too far up the road for Norris and so that’s how they finished, with the Spaniard claiming his fourth career F1 win and Norris taking home 18 points; a 10-point gain on Verstappen, who finished sixth. With four races and two sprints left to go, the gap between them now stands at 47 points with 120 still available.', '“I expect a tough battle with Max,” Lando reflected afterwards. “I don’t want to complain about it, you know? Because this is what I love. I love going into races and know he’s going to put up a good fight. But things like today are just a bit too far in my opinion. If I didn’t do what I did today and avoid him, I’d probably be out of the race.”', 'There was a meeting between the drivers and the FIA before the race, and the governing body has agreed to revise the rules in time for the Qatar Grand Prix next month so that forcing a rival off is penalised more harshly.

Carlos Sainz’s F1 Mexico GP win pushes Ferrari closer to a ‘perfect goodbye’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5877477/2024/10/28/carlos-sainz-f1-mexico-gp-ferrari/,"['Formula 1', '6', 'Stay informed on all the biggest stories in Formula One. Sign up here to receive the Prime Tire newsletter in your inbox every Monday and Friday.', 'MEXICO CITY — Carlos Sainz climbed on top of his vibrant red Ferrari, spreading his arms wide before raising his fists in the air.', 'The emotions were evident. The Spaniard started the Mexico City Grand Prix from pole, and though he lost the lead to Max Verstappen, Sainz regained first and put together one of the strongest drives of his Formula One career. His race engineer, Ricciardo Adami, called Sunday’s performance “a master class” over the radio at the end of the race.', '', 'Sainz is the first driver to win the Mexico City GP from pole in eight years and the first Ferrari driver to win the race since 1990 when Alain Prost accomplished the feat. This season is the first time Sainz has won multiple grands prix — the first in Australia 16 days after surgery and now here in Mexico.', 'Ferrari wasn’t good enough to be in the constructors’ title fight before summer break, but its recent upgrades have helped push the Maranello-based team to second in the standings with four races to go. It’s fair to say that Ferrari could be in the mix again in 2025 if things stay the course.', 'But it’ll be without Sainz.', '“Honestly, I really wanted this one — I needed it for myself, I wanted to get it done,” Sainz said. “I’ve been saying for a while I wanted one more win before leaving Ferrari, and to do it here in front of this mega crowd is incredible.', '“Now four races left, I want to enjoy as much as possible, and if another one comes, I will go for it.”', 'Your Mexico City Grand Prix Winner!!! 🏆 @Carlossainz55 #MexicoGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/gtQ7yRIEQ6', '— Scuderia Ferrari HP (@ScuderiaFerrari) October 27, 2024', '', 'Sainz had to work for his second victory of the season.', 'Verstappen took the lead after the grid barreled towards Turn 1, though that wasn’t surprising. Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is a low-grip track, and as the Ferrari driver noted, Red Bull tends to start well at these circuits. Verstappen stayed on the inside of Sainz heading into Turn 1, and though Sainz said he braked as late as he could, Verstappen did the same. This left Sainz with “no space to go into Turn 2.” Verstappen emerged with the early race lead.', 'Because of the early collision between Alex Albon and Yuki Tsunoda, the grid settled behind the safety car for several laps. Verstappen nailed the restart, but Sainz stayed in his rearview mirrors, never letting the Red Bull stray too far out of sight. He made his move on Lap 9.', '“With Max, you need to be determined. You need to be decisive,” Sainz said. “If you’re not, you’re never going to pass him. And in that case, I think I caught him a bit by surprise, and I could make it stick.”', 'Did he send it?', ""Or did he… don't… didn't send it?"", 'Oh no, wait – HE ABSOLUTELY SENT IT! 💪#F1 #MexicoGP pic.twitter.com/D7a0xIiyTX', '— Formula 1 (@F1) October 27, 2024', '', 'With some help from DRS and a tow, Sainz lunged past the Dutchman to re-secure a lead the Spaniard never relinquished. The Ferrari driver initially appeared too far back to make the move, but in the final 100 meters, Sainz said, “I felt like I had a good momentum, and I’ve been feeling very confident braking into Turn 1 this weekend. The car has been giving me confidence to brake late there, and I just went for it, and it happened. Also, this mentality of knowing I had a bit less to lose in that battle and that I could be aggressive and send one.”', 'He described it as a “high tension” moment because a chaotic battle unfolded between Verstappen and Lando Norris behind him. It resulted in the Red Bull driver receiving two 10-second time penalties, which he served on the first pit stop.', 'GO DEEPER', ""Max Verstappen's Mexico GP penalties hurt. It won't change how he races Lando Norris"", 'Once Sainz regained the lead, roughly 60 or so laps remained. Plenty of action unfolded throughout the race, like Liam Lawson battling Sergio Pérez or Norris hunting Charles Leclerc in those final laps. Ahead of all of them, it appeared to be a rather problem-free race for Sainz aside from the report of a misfire. He said that was an “isolated incident.”', '', '“The only misfire I had all race was at the exit of Turn 3. Landing after the curb, I did a little short shift and it gave me a misfire, which was a bit scary, but we’ve had them during the weekend and we know it’s due to the altitude and the mapping,” Sainz said. “But once I was in the lead, I was trusting my pace, my management, and I knew this weekend I’ve been very quick, and I knew I just had to do whatever I had planned, and the win was possible.”', 'At around lap 49, Sainz also raised over the radio that he felt Ferrari was pushing too hard. It was a Prancing Horse 1-2 at the time, and Leclerc wasn’t far behind. The Monegasque driver, though, lost second in a battle with Norris. He lost the rear and nearly hit the barriers, saving it at the last moment.', 'It may not have been a Ferrari 1-2 in the end; however, the first and third-place finishes, plus Leclerc securing the fastest lap, was enough to launch the team ahead of Red Bull in the standings — a 25-point lead to be specific.', 'Sainz admitted he shed a tear as the Spanish national anthem played in celebration at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.', 'Just below the podium stood his parents, Carlos Sainz Sr. and Reyes Vázquez de Castro, and his partner, Rebecca Donaldson. His best friends also attended the race weekend, and all those present made this moment that much sweeter.', '“It’s one of the best moments in my career. My mom had never been present on a race win with me, and the fact that she was coming here this weekend, I wanted really to win a race in front of her,” Sainz said. “On top of that, the way the whole weekend panned out, it was just perfect.', '“Losing at the start and then having to fight back with Max just made everything a bit more tricky. Probably makes it taste even better because I had to work hard for it.”', 'It has been a long year, not just for Ferrari but also for Sainz. News broke in February that Lewis Hamilton would join the team in 2025, leaving the 30-year-old without a seat despite being competitive among the top teams. It wasn’t until late July that the announcement came that Sainz would head to Williams Racing next season, a team trying to rebuild.', '', 'Meanwhile, Ferrari started the season competitively before falling into a tricky development stretch that saw it drop behind McLaren and Mercedes by summer break. It brought upgrades in Monza, and Leclerc won, but time would tell if it was a proper step forward. That confirmation came in Austin when Ferrari went 1-2, with Leclerc winning his third grand prix of the season.', 'Leclerc said that the constructors’ championship is “realistically possible.” Ferrari is 29 points behind McLaren, which leads the standings with 566 points. But as Sainz noted, the team will need to be consistent. Winning the constructors’ championship for the first time since 2008 would be the perfect sendoff for Sainz.', '“I think it could have been quite easy for me to lose a bit of motivation and to lose a bit of the drive to make it happen, but those three weeks of break (after Singapore) served me well,” Sainz said. “I managed to regain a bit of the determination and the drive that I needed for these last five, six races of the season. And I managed to put myself in a position with improving my driving, my confidence with the car, to put myself in a position to, first, win in Austin that I didn’t make it happen — Charles did a great job there — and put myself in a position to win here and this one I was just going to make sure it doesn’t slip from my hands.', '“Not an easy year, but proud of the way that I’ve managed to keep myself in it and obviously trying to help the team now as much as I can to win these constructors because it would be the perfect goodbye for me.”', 'GO DEEPER', 'F1’s Carlos Sainz embraces final races as a Ferrari driver: ""No one can take that away""', '', '(Top photo: Jared C.

Drama then unfolded in the laps that followed as Verstappen engaged in a scrap with title rival Lando Norris – leading to Verstappen receiving two 10-second penalties for his moves on the Briton.', 'That melee allowed Charles Leclerc through into second, and from there the Ferrari duo enjoyed a mostly unchallenged drive at the front – until Norris managed to chase Leclerc down in the latter stages and take second place after a wide moment for the Monegasque.', 'While Norris tried to cut into Sainz’s lead, the Briton ultimately ran out of time and had to settle for second as his former team mate claimed the win by 4.7s. Leclerc made it a double Ferrari podium in third, ahead of the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, the seven-time world champion winning out in a late-race intra-team fight.', 'After that 20-second penalty, Verstappen put in a recovery drive to cross the line in sixth on what was a tough day for Red Bull.

Meanwhile Verstappen led the pack around behind the Safety Car, followed by Sainz, Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton and Russell.', 'The news followed that Perez had been handed a five-second penalty due to being too far forward in his pit box, just as the Safety Car prepared to peel in on Lap 6.

Another driver facing issues was Colapinto, who reported steering problems as he tried to hold off Magnussen in a battle for P9.', 'Lap 40 saw Piastri and Lawson make their pit stops for the hard tyre, leaving only Colapinto, Bottas, Ocon and Zhou to visit the pits. Overhead, the skies looked increasingly grey – and Russell soon reported small rain drops on his visor.', 'Up ahead, Sainz was leading Leclerc by six seconds, while Norris had a deficit of just under five seconds to Leclerc as the Briton looked to maximise his points with Verstappen back in sixth place. Perez, meanwhile, pitted again for another set of medium tyres, the local hero having a tough afternoon down in 17th.', 'Norris pumped in the fastest lap of the race on Lap 47, the gap to Leclerc having come down to just over four seconds, and team mate Piastri was busy trying to find a way past Colapinto for ninth – before the Australian was freed up as the Williams finally headed to the pits. A slightly slow stop brought him out into P15.', 'With Hamilton chasing down Russell in fourth, the latter was told that the duo were “free to race”. The scrap was unfolding 12 seconds up the road from Verstappen in sixth, while Magnussen, Hulkenberg, Piastri and Gasly were the final top-10 runners.', 'Hamilton and Russell went head-to-head, with Hamilton eventually coming out on top', 'As the race headed into its final 15 laps, Hamilton remained right on the tail of Russell but looked to be struggling to get through. Piastri, meanwhile, had stormed past Hulkenberg into eighth, with Magnussen the next target a further seven seconds ahead, while Norris had closed the gap to Leclerc down to 2.3s.', 'With the front-runners having to lap the cars behind, Norris benefitted from DRS behind Lawson and managed to eat into that deficit further, putting him just 1.2s away from Leclerc. Behind them, the Mercedes cars were still going wheel-to-wheel but Russell continued his robust defence.', 'Norris again set the fastest lap on Lap 62, the McLaren now just 0.5s behind. But further drama hit when Leclerc went wide into the final corner, only narrowly avoiding contact with the barriers, which allowed Norris through to try to chase down Sainz.', 'Another driver making moves was Hamilton, who finally pulled off an overtake on Russell on Lap 66. Elsewhere a battle of the youngsters was taking place between Colapinto and Lawson, but contact between the two forced Lawson to pit after picking up damage to the RB.', 'While Norris was slowly cutting into Sainz’s lead, the Briton looked to be running out of time to challenge the Spaniard for the win. Red Bull, meanwhile, pitted Perez – running with a damaged car after his early scrap with Lawson – in an attempt to steal the fastest lap point from any of their rivals.', 'Perez had a difficult afternoon in front of his home fans', 'As the chequered flag was thrown, Sainz crossed the line to take his fourth victory in F1, leading the way from Norris by 4.7s. Leclerc followed in third, while the Monegasque also clinched the additional point for fastest lap after a late pit stop for the soft tyre.', 'Hamilton took fourth ahead of team mate Russell, and Verstappen claimed sixth in what was a damage limitation drive following those earlier penalties. Behind him, Magnussen and Hulkenberg sealed a decent haul of points for Haas, the pair ending the race in seventh and ninth respectively.', 'Piastri slotted between them in eighth, bouncing back from that lowly grid slot of seventeenth, and the final point on offer went to Gasly in 10th place. Stroll, meanwhile, missed out on adding to Aston Martin’s tally in 11th.', 'Colapinto was 12th for Williams, though the Argentinian was handed a 10-second time penalty after the race for his battle with Lawson. Ocon finished in 12th, with Bottas and Zhou in 14th and 15th.', 'Lawson took 16th place ahead of Perez as the final classified runner in 17th – not the result the Mexican would have been hoping for at his home track – with Alonso, Albon and Tsunoda the three retirees.', 'Sainz scored the fourth victory of his F1 career in the Mexico City Grand Prix', '""Gracias Mexico!"" said a jubilant Sainz. ""It’s incredible to see this crowd, I’ve been feeling their support all week. I feel like I have a lot of fanbase here in Mexico and they gave me a lot of strength to do the weekend that I’ve done. Honestly, I really wanted this one, I really needed it also for myself – I wanted to get it done.

The McLaren driver made a move around Turn 4 but Verstappen held firm, with Norris cutting the grass at Turn 5 to stay ahead. Verstappen remained glued to the McLaren driver into the left-hand kink at Turn 8 and lunged on his rival, taking them both into the run-off area, ceding a position to Charles Leclerc in the process.', 'The Turn 4 incident was tight, but the Turn 8 attempt was a blatant foul on Norris by Verstappen, whose trajectory showed he had no intention to make the apex. Stewards handed Verstappen two 10-second time penalties, which he had to serve at his pit stop, and he dropped down the order before recovering to sixth place.', 'In Austin, Verstappen played the rulebook perfectly—but in Mexico City it was purely reckless, and a throwback to some of Verstappen’s driving in his 2021 fight with Lewis Hamilton.', 'Verstappen was reluctant to be drawn on his driving standards and instead pointed the finger at the performance of the RB20.', '“Honestly 20 seconds is a lot, but I’m not going to cry about it, and I’m not going to share my opinion,” Verstappen said. “The biggest problem I have is today was a bad day in terms of race pace, that was quite clear again on the mediums and hard tyres.', 'Pushed further Verstappen said: “Turn 4 was a bit more of like question mark, Turn 7 [sic] is what it is. Honestly those two things are also not my problem, the problem is that we are too slow and that’s why I’m being put in those positions, that is my problem.”', 'A nonchalant Verstappen added that “I just drive how I think I have to drive, last week that was alright, this week it’s a 20-second penalty, it is what it is, life goes on you know.”', 'Verstappen was also issued two penalty points, bringing his 12-month total up to six, halfway to a one-event suspension.', 'Norris went on to re-pass Leclerc—assisted by a mistake from the Ferrari driver in the second stint —to take second, cutting Verstappen’s points advantage to 47 with 120 to play for across the final four grands prix in São Paulo, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.', '“I go into a race expecting a tough battle with Max,” Norris said. “It’s clear that it doesn’t matter if he wins or is second, his only job is to beat me in the race. And he’ll sacrifice himself to do that, like he did today. But I want to have good battles with him. I want to have those tough battles, like I’ve seen him have plenty of times, but fair ones. It’s always going to be on the line, it’s always going to be tough with Max. He’s never going to make anyone’s life easy, especially mine at this point of the year. I think today it was just not fair, clean racing. Therefore I think he got what he had coming to him.”', 'Sainz was the class act through qualifying and the race, as he took only a handful of laps to restore the lead he relinquished on the lengthy run to Turn 1, before controlling proceedings thereafter.', 'It was a victory Sainz has been chasing for several months as he seeks to sign off his four-year stint—ahead of his move to Williams following Ferrari’s signing of Lewis Hamilton—in the best possible fashion. It was particularly emotional for Sainz as it was the first time that his mother was at the circuit to see him claim a Grand Prix win, the fourth of his career.', ""“I had a very good feeling coming into the weekend,” Sainz said. “I’ve been focused, been on it all weekend. On top of that, I knew my family was coming, my best friends, my girlfriend, a lot of people were here to support me. And I said, maybe destiny has something ready for me this weekend, knowing that my maybe last win with Ferrari can come in front of them, with all the support that I've had from them all this year, and in a great podium, a great place like Mexico City."", ""“It was extremely emotional. I did share a tear, you know, in the Spanish anthem. It's one of the best moments of my career. My mom had never personally been on a race with me. And the fact that she was coming here this weekend, I wanted really to win a race in front of her.”"", 'Leclerc’s late error dropped him to third but another strong result means Ferrari is now firmly in contention for the Constructors’ Championship, having closed the deficit to McLaren to just 29 points, with Red Bull Racing now having dropped to third place.', 'Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur quipped that the Verstappen/Norris title fight was good news for his team.', ""“As long as we are under the radar, it allows us to be fully focused on what we are doing, on the team, on the drivers,” Vasseur said. “This is a perfect situation for us. I think you [the media] will have tons to say about Max and Lando today, it will be the headlines tomorrow, and it's good for us.”"", 'Sainz’s win also makes 2024 the first season since 1982—and only second in history—in which six different drivers have claimed multiple Grand Prix victories.', ""Red Bull's Sergio Perez arrived in Mexico City under pressure to deliver a result and he ended up having a thoroughly wretched weekend."", 'Brake issues, which Perez says has been hindering him for several grands prix, contributed to a Q1 exit, consigning him to a difficult race.

The world championship leader was given two 10-second penalties for the incidents and subsequently finished sixth, with Norris second. Verstappen had been similarly aggressive at the last round in Austin and Norris was disappointed his title rival was choosing to drive in such an uncompromising fashion.', '“Today was not fair, clean racing,” Norris said. “Therefore he got what he had coming to him.”', 'The British driver felt Verstappen knew that with a 57-point advantage in the championship standings before the race, he could afford to take risks at his expense.', '“Today I felt like I had to avoid collisions and that’s not what you want to do in a race,” he said. “He is in a very powerful position in the championship. He is a long way ahead and he has nothing to lose. He knows how to drive and I am sure he knows today was probably over the limit.”', 'Verstappen admitted he felt the lack of performance in the Red Bull had pushed him into being more combative on track. “The problem is when you are slower you are being put in these kind of positions, I am not going to give up easily,” he said.', '“At the end of the day it’s not about agreeing or disagreeing about the penalty. The biggest problem of today is the race pace, which is not good, and something we need to analyse.

I mean obviously there’s been a reaction to last weekend (when Norris was penalised for an incident with Verstappen), and I think it’s very important for the drivers’ steward and the drivers to sit down, because if I show you here on the GPS – this is on the run down to Turn 4.', 'HIGHLIGHTS: Sainz storms to victory in Mexico as Verstappen penalised twice in dramatic Norris battle', '“This is actually Lando versus Lando, and what you can see is that the orange line is Lando’s fastest lap of the grand prix, so the point he is braking for Turn 4 and then obviously executing the corner.

As the laps ticked down in the Mexico City Grand Prix, the team was on the verge of a second-straight one-two finish, in the wake of Charles Leclerc’s victory last week in Austin. Carlos Sainz Jr. was powering his SF-24 around the circuit with a commanding lead, and with Leclerc behind him, the Scuderia were on the cusp of their second-straight front-row lockout, the first time since Felipe Massa and Kimi Räikkönen accomplished the feat in the Bahrain Grand Prix, and then the Spanish Grand Prix, early in 2008.', 'However, it was not to be. A slide from Leclerc at Turn 17 on the 63rd lap of the race opened the door for Lando Norris, and the McLaren driver rocketed into second. Leclerc managed to save the slide before slamming into the barrier — preventing what would have been a disastrous end to a strong day — but the miscue denied Ferrari their one-two finish as Leclerc settled for third behind his teammate and Norris.', 'But with Sunday’s results, Sainz and Leclerc moved one step closer to something else Massa and Räikkönen accomplished in 2008.', 'A Constructors’ Championship.', 'Sainz’s win, his second this season, vaulted Ferrari over Red Bull and into second in the Constructors’ Championship standings. Now they sit just 29 points behind McLaren in that fight, and with four race weekends remaining — plus a pair of F1 Sprint races in São Paulo and Qatar — they are firmly in that fight.', 'A fact both drivers addressed in the FIA Press Conference after the race.', '“Yeah, of course [the Constructors’ Championship] has to be our target, because we don’t have to think about it every day. And I think the best way to achieve it is by just focusing on our own self and trying to maximise the package of our car, which is what we have done since two weekends,” said Leclerc. “But yeah, the Constructors’ now is realistically possible. And it relies on us doing well more than others doing something wrong, which I’ve often said is probably the case for the Drivers’ Championship. For the Drivers’ Championship I need to do everything right and I need a lot of bad luck to happen elsewhere. So the Constructors’ is definitely our main target and if we continue in that form it’s a realistic one.”', '“Yeah, I think we both believe it is possible and we are actually talking about it more and more often now. We pump each other up a bit, knowing that there’s a chance and we are like, ‘Yeah, come on’. You know, we have a good relationship and I think we both know there is a chance and we both know we are in a good moment in our driving, the way we’re driving,” said Sainz. “And yeah, I think one of the keys is going to be consistency and having the two drivers always up there. I think this weekend, We did a really good job on that on a tricky track where you could see Q1 and Q2 was a bit of chaos and anything could go right or wrong.', '“So we just need to keep ourselves in that fight. And as Charles said, don’t get obsessed with it because it’s not like it depends only on us. We also, given how fast McLaren is, depend a bit on them. But yeah, we’re going to keep doing the best we can and keep pumping each other up to win it.”', 'Thanks to Ferrari’s recent form, the Tifosi can believe.', 'Here are some more winners and losers from the Mexico City Grand Prix.', 'With four race weekends remaining, McLaren remains in the lead for the Constructors’ Championship. Both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri finished in the points on Sunday, with Norris up in second behind Sainz. As for Piastri, he needed to deliver a tremendous recovery drive after he was eliminated in Q1 on Saturday and he did just that, fighting through the field to finish eighth.', 'While Piastri conceded following the race that “P8’s not where we want to be finishing,” it was a strong recovery drive when the team needed one from him.', 'As for Norris, the second-place finish — coupled with Verstappen’s 20 seconds worth of penalties — saw him inch ten points closer to the Red Bull driver in the Drivers’ Championship race.', 'Still, Norris is honest about the gap to Verstappen in that fight.', '“I mean, I’m 47 behind still, so it doesn’t feel like I’m much closer than what I was, but every point helps,” said Norris in the FIA Press Conference. “Charles got fastest lap at the end, so that’s one point they took away from me, but... Yeah, I don’t know. I’m just doing my own thing and focusing. And as a team, we’re doing our own thing and focusing on ourselves. A lot of people against us, but we’ll keep pushing forward.”', 'With four race weekends left, McLaren is running at the front.', 'And a Constructors’ Championship is in sight, but it might go down to the wire.', '“Lando raced our upgraded car this weekend, and once again I’d like to say a big thank you to the Technical Department for preparing this car and to the entire team for getting it to the track,” said Andrea Stella in the team’s post-race report.', '“Oscar will also have the upgrade in Brazil. He drove a beautiful race today. It wasn’t easy to get through the field, but he was patient when he needed to be and brought home some useful points,” added Stella. “Those could be critical at the end of the season, because this championship is going to the wire.', '“Now we focus on São Paulo. We’re looking forward to another entertaining race with Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes. This is good for Formula One – and we’re having fun!”', 'By almost any metric, Sunday was a disaster for Red Bull.', 'With Sergio Pérez starting at the back of the grid due to a shocking Q1 exit on Saturday — more on him in a moment — Max Verstappen was left to fight at the front by himself on Sunday.', 'As you might have expected, his biggest scrape came against Lando Norris, his rival in the Drivers’ Championship race. Similar to last week the two banged their way through a portion of the track, but this time the penalties that race officials handed down in the aftermath were harsh and solely Verstappen’s. The driver was hit with a pair of ten-second penalties — as well as a pair of penalty points on his Super License — and those rulings doomed any chance of Verstappen fighting for a podium.', 'After serving his penalty on his one pit stop, Verstappen managed to fight back into the points and manage a sixth-place finish.', 'But with Norris finishing ahead of him Verstappen saw his rival inch closer to him in the Drivers’ Championship fight, and the team saw Ferrari leapfrog them in the Constructors’ race.', '“Start was good but after that, there was no pace,” said Verstappen in the team’s post-race report. “Quite a long pit stop as well because of the penalties, but it is what it is. We just have to try and understand what went wrong this whole weekend because it felt like we were not really competitive, and try and be better in Brazil.”', 'If it was bad for Verstappen, it was brutal for Pérez. Starting at the back of the grid Pérez managed to pick up five spots on the opening lap but was hit with a five-second penalty as he was improperly situated in his grid box at the start, and he was penalized for a false start. He then fought several battles at the back of the grid including several with Liam Lawson — who is in contention for Pérez’s seat at Red Bull for next year — and could not get into the points.', 'Making matters worse was the fact that Red Bull, hoping to deny either McLaren or Ferrari from picking up the bonus point for the fastest lap, called Pérez into the pits late in the race and bolted on a set of soft tires, hoping he could at least deny their rivals that extra point.', 'He could not beat the time posted by Leclerc, who delivered a similar glory run at the death once his odds of finishing second went out the window.', 'While Pérez blasted Lawson after the race, saying the young driver “needs to be a bit more humble,” he again faced questions about his future. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner did him no favors:', 'Red Bull arrived in Mexico City second in the Constructors’ Championship race.', 'They leave in third after a brutal few days.', 'Following the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this season, Haas trailed Visa Cash App RB F1 Team 28-7 in the Constructors’ Championship standings.', 'With just four race weekends remaining, they now have a 46-36 lead in that fight.', 'Nico Hülkenberg and Kevin Magnussen delivered a double-points result for the team in Mexico City, with Hülkenberg finishing ninth and Magnussen seventh. It was a Sunday that Team Principal Ayao Komatsu hailed as an “amazing” race for the team.', '“I don’t know what to say, it’s another amazing result for this team. I’m so happy that everyone’s hard work is paying off, with the updates, and the car getting better. I’m so happy for Kevin, he drove very well in Austin, but we couldn’t quite deliver on Sunday, but this weekend he had an amazing qualifying – today everyone delivered,” said Komatsu in the team’s post-race report. “His pace in the second stint was unbelievable, he was catching Verstappen in his Red Bull and was finishing just four seconds behind. That was probably the best I’ve seen Kevin drive, I’m so happy for him. In a way, Nico being disappointed with P9 is a great sign for the team as well. Today Kevin showed what the car is capable of, so we’ll look at the data to see why Nico couldn’t perform the way he could perform. I’m looking forward to going to Brazil, another Sprint weekend, and really trying to go for another double points finish. A huge congratulations to everyone and a big thank you.”', 'Magnussen described the race as a “perfect” day.“', '“It was a perfect day, really. We got everything right, the balance of the car was right in that sweet spot, and I was able to manage the tires when I needed and push hard when I needed. P7 is a better result than we could’ve hoped for because we had Piastri cruising through the field and I just about managed to keep him behind,” said Magnussen, highlighting the ability to hold off the quick McLaren at the end of the race. “The last year or so has been tough, and I feel like I’m finding my rhythm again, so I hope we can finish this year really nailing points in these last four races.”', 'Sunday was supposed to be a celebration for Aston Martin and Fernando Alonso, who was participating in his 400th Grand Prix weekend.', 'His race ended after just 15 laps after he was forced to retire the car due to an issue with his AMR24.', 'On the other side of the garage Lance Stroll fought hard and almost got himself into the points, but could only finish 11th.', '“Lance drove a very strong race today, but points were just out of reach. We did not have great pace all weekend, but Lance managed the race well, looked after the tires, and enjoyed some fun battles on the track,” said Team Principal Mike Krack in the team’s post-race report. “It was a shame Fernando’s 400th Grand Prix weekend ended early with a front brake issue. The temperatures were getting too high so we had to retire the car. Even though we just missed out on points today, we take the learnings and the positives into Brazil next week.', '“Full credit to the trackside team, too, for their continued hard work across this triple-header.”', 'Still, Alonso found the bright side in what was a difficult Grand Prix.', '“I felt a lot of love this weekend with lots of nice messages and respect from people,” added Alonso. “Despite the result, I have a positive feeling from the weekend and I’m confident we can have better performance in Brazil.”', 'When I sat down with Pierre Gasly ahead of the United States Grand Prix, the Alpine driver made the case that a positive end to what has been a tough season would be signs of progress from the team, and improved performance from the A524.', 'Since that discussion, Gasly has advanced to Q3 in the Grand Prix qualifying format twice — both in impressive fashion — and now he has a point to bring to Brazil from Mexico City, thanks to his tenth-place finish in the Mexico City Grand Prix.', 'That point inched Alpine one step closer to Williams in their fight for eighth in the Constructors’ Championship, as they now trail 17-14 in that race.', '“I’m very pleased with the point today. It’s only one point – probably the best we could achieve – but it’s satisfying as it’s been a few races since we last scored and it shows that we are continuing to improve. After a strong Qualifying yesterday, it was important for us to confirm that with a reward, so I’m happy for the team that we got tenth place today,” said Gasly in the team’s post-race report. “It was a close call at Turn 1. I felt some contact, then I saw Yuki [Tsunoda] go off, so certainly quite fortunate to escape from that. From there, we just drove our own race and focused on managing everything as best as we could. Next week, we go to São Paulo for another Sprint event. We have some work to do, especially our race pace, but I’m optimistic for another positive weekend.”', 'Team boss Oliver Oakes hailed Gasly’s “good race” in his comments.', '“It’s nice to come away from Mexico City with a point and return to the top ten. Pierre drove a good race; we did not have the pace to challenge the Haas cars today,” said Oakes. “We took the opportunity to change components on Esteban’s car, which meant he started from the pit lane running him long in the first stint and he did well to recover some places throughout the race. We were not as competitive in race trim as we were in Qualifying, so we have a bit of work to do in the coming races.”', 'Signs of life as a tough season winds down at Alpine.', 'After a tough Saturday for Visa Cash App RB F1 Team, Sunday was even worse.', 'Yuki Tsunoda was caught up in traffic shortly after the race began, coming into contact with Alexander Albon and spinning off the racing line and into the barrier, ending his race at the first turn. It was the second hard shunt for Tsunoda in as many days, as he crashed in qualifying on Saturday.', '“There just wasn’t enough space. It was a racing incident. It was very tricky. If I had qualified where our true pace was, we wouldn’t have been in that position,” said Tsunoda. “I’m very sorry to the Team. They did a fantastic job to prepare everything from yesterday. I want to make it up to them in Brazil.”', 'As for Liam Lawson, he finished the race outside of the points, and then found himself waiting outside Christian Horner’s office for a post-race chat with the Red Bull boss, perhaps related to his on-track scuffle with Sergio Pérez:', 'A Christian Horner no le gustó ni el manejo ni la actitud de Liam Lawson contra @SChecoPerez y lo llamó a su oficina al término del #MexicoGP pic.twitter.com/8AQYu9varS', 'Pérez was none too happy as well with Lawson, as the veteran driver blasted Lawson’s attitude in his post-race media comments:', 'Liam Lawson doesn\'t have the right attitude for Formula 1, says Checo\n\n""I think the way he has come to Formula 1, I don\'t think he has the right attitude for it.

Sainz wins F1 Mexico City Grand Prix as Norris makes Verstappen pay penalty,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/carlos-sainz-wins-f1-mexico-city-grand-prix-as-lando-norris-cuts-title-race-gap,"['Lando Norris might have been beaming by the end of the Mexico City Grand Prix but the British driver’s patience and temper is clearly being sorely tested by his world championship rival Max Verstappen in a title fight where the defending champion was looking very much like he is beginning to feel the pressure.', 'As Verstappen once more pushed the envelope of what is acceptable on track, this time Norris came out in front of the Dutchman but it was Carlos Sainz who took an impressive win for Ferrari at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.', 'Yet the Scuderia were overshadowed in a race notable because Verstappen suffered a double blow of his own making and a significantly adverse impact, his repeatedly uncompromising driving against Norris deemed unacceptable and proving costly to his title charge.', 'After their testy and controversial conflict at the last round in Austin, the pair were centre stage once more. Norris finished in second place for McLaren with Verstappen in sixth. The result is vital for Norris as he attempts to catch the world champion and take the title fight to the wire, with a 10-point swing closing the gap to Verstappen from 57 to 47 points and a further 120 still on the table.', 'Verstappen can really only hold himself to blame for letting his rival back in the chase. The pair might have been set for a race-long battle but the points differential may have been minimised were it not for Verstappen insisting on being entirely intransigent in both his defending and attacking.', 'After an early safety car period and with Norris quicker than Verstappen the British driver went to pass. With sharp echoes of Texas, Verstappen once more pushed the British driver wide as he took the place. Norris was furious. “This guy’s dangerous, I just have to avoid a crash, I’ll end up in the wall,” he said.', 'The pair are good friends but on this form, how much of Verstappen’s attitude to wheel-to-wheel racing Norris is willing to accede to in good humour must be in question.', 'More followed. As the pair continued to vie, with Norris once more refusing to cede his position, Verstappen came back on him and dived up the inside too hot, taking the place back by going wide and forcing Norris off.', 'The stewards swiftly awarded the Dutchman a 10-second penalty for the first incident at turn four and Verstappen was told there had been a “lot of whinging” from Norris but worse was to follow as he was given another 10-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage in the second incident at turn eight. Verstappen had track position but with 20 seconds to come, he was now chasing damage limitation.', 'Verstappen had been the beneficiary in Austin but this time it had been hugely costly and once more provoked a heated debate that will not die down quietly. On Friday the drivers had met to discuss the \xaddriving rules, particularly in reference to pushing one another off track, as set out in the FIA driving standards guidelines document and there was apparent consensus they should be adapted to prevent further incidents.', 'The FIA had agreed to address the issue, with expected modification set to be agreed with drivers in two races’ time at Qatar. However the stewards in Mexico felt Verstappen had clearly overstepped the mark twice and perhaps a more urgent meeting will now be convened before the next round in Brazil next weekend.', 'Verstappen was aggrieved as ever, but it was impossible to ignore that by being just a little less aggressive he would have been at least in position to finish within a couple of places of Norris. He later admitted he felt the car was off the pace and that it had forced his hand.', 'During the only round of pit stops Verstappen took his penalty with a painfully slow wait in his box and emerged in 15th. He charged hard to come back but the damage had been done. If Norris can push this tight fight to the wire, the Dutchman might look back on these moments of bullishness with regret.', 'Norris went on to take second from Charles Leclerc on lap 63 but Sainz and Ferrari claimed a deserved victory. A tour de force for Sainz with his teammate Leclerc in third that establishes the Scuderia as very much now a leading force on the grid.', 'They have two wins on the bounce for the first time this season and it was another significant victory. They have finally taken a big step forward as one of the quickest cars and passed Red Bull for second in the constructors’ championship. On this form they have a real shot at taking the title from the current leaders, McLaren.', 'For Norris there are just four meetings to come, with two sprint races, and while he remains the outsider in the title fight he has at least kept it alive and narrowed the gap. One or two more blows to a rattled Verstappen and it could yet go all the way.', 'Lewis Hamilton and George Russell claimed fourth and fifth for Mercedes.']"

We see the problem and we know the problem that we have, it doesn’t have a quick fix.”', 'He will start 18th on Sunday at a track notoriously difficult to pass and where he crashed on the first lap last year.

This is the weekend when I want to do my best, unfortunately we have not been able to achieve it.”', 'Although team principal Christian Horner insisted multiple times this weekend that Perez is under contract at Red Bull for 2025 — with an option for 2026 — there are performance clauses that could cost Perez his seat at the end of the season.', '“I think he’s summed it up perfectly — it’s been a bad year for Checo,” Horner said Friday. “We know what he’s capable of and we’re hoping that we can give him a set-up and the confidence in the car to extract the kind of performances that we know he’s very capable of.', '“Checo’s our driver. He’s contracted for 2025. He’s competitive. He’s hungry. He’s not happy with where he currently is. So as a team, we’re doing our very best to support him,” Horner continued. “Obviously, big weekend for him here, huge support.”', 'But he flopped in qualifying, which bodes poorly for Sunday when he needs to perform.

He will likely receive a fresh engine ahead of the next race in Brazil, where he would receive a grid penalty but passing isn’t as difficult as it is in Mexico City.', 'Verstappen will likely be aggressive Sunday in an attempt to seize the lead away from Sainz at the start. He had a decent final practice after the engine change but isn’t sure what his Red Bull has for the race.', '“Yesterday I barely didn’t do any laps, so playing a lot of catch-up,” Verstappen said. “I was already under a lot of pressure to have a good qualifying. But very happy to be on the front row.”', 'Oscar Piastri, who was fastest in Saturday’s third practice session, did not advance out of the first round.

Verstappen, known for his aggressive driving style, was penalized twice — first for forcing rival Lando Norris off the track and then for leaving the track and gaining an advantage.', 'Horner described the penalties as ""harsh,"" suggesting that the current racing rules lack clarity, particularly when it comes to aggressive driving that blur the lines of acceptability on the track.', '""Max did leave the track at Turn Four then at Seven, Lando opened the door very late and both ran off there,"" Horner explained in response to the incidents that led to Verstappen’s penalties, via Sky Sports F1.', 'The race unfolded at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with Carlos Sainz of Ferrari clinching victory. Starting from second on the grid, Verstappen managed an impressive start, overtaking the Spaniard in the first turn. However, his lead was short-lived, firstly after Sainz overtook him after a safety car, but also due to a series of penalties that drastically affected his race.', '""The problem is, I think we\'re going to get into very dangerous territory of, at what point is a dive bomb going to be OK?"" Horner questioned. ""I think, really, the FIA and the drivers need to sit down and decide what is acceptable and what isn\'t. I thought two 10-second [penalties] was a bit on the harsh side today.""', 'The Red Bull chief is advocating for a more explicit dialogue between the FIA and drivers to refine what is permissible during races. This reflects ongoing debates within Formula 1 regarding the consistency and interpretation of rules around aggressive driving, especially given previous controversies involving Verstappen, such as similar incidents at the United States Grand Prix.', 'Lando Norris managed to secure a podium finish, coming in second between the Ferrari drivers. His rivalry with Verstappen has been a defining narrative of the 2024 season, with Norris frequently finding himself in contest with the Dutch driver. Following the race, Norris commented on the dangerous driving:', '""I was ahead the whole way through the corner. This guy is dangerous. It\'s the same as last time. I\'ll be in the wall in a minute.""', 'As Ferrari and McLaren capitalized on their day, Red Bull faced challenges not only with penalties but with their overall pace throughout the race.', '""You\'ve always got to play to the rules. We\'ll look and learn from this race, but more for us today was that we just didn\'t have the pace. That\'s where our focus will be in the next five days,"" Horner conceded.', ""The results of the Mexican Grand Prix have considerable implications for the constructors' and drivers' championships. Ferrari’s victory, propelled by Carlos Sainz and supported by Charles Leclerc’s efforts, means the Scuderia are now ahead of Red Bull in the Constructor Standings. Meanwhile, Verstappen's setback adds more pressure to the drivers’ championship battle, as every point now becomes crucial as he fends off Lando Norris, and he Charles Leclerc."", ""Alex is the editor-in-chief of F1 editorial.

So Norris was trying not to criticise the Dutchman too much after the Mexico City Grand Prix. But in the end he felt he had no choice.', '“It was not fair, clean racing,” Norris said of Verstappen’s driving, which earned the three-time world champion two 10-second penalties for two separate incidents within four corners of each other early in the race. “And therefore I think he got what he had coming to him.', ""“I felt like I just had to avoid collisions, and that's not what you feel like you want to do in a race. He's in a very powerful position in the championship. He's a long way ahead. He has nothing to lose."", '“It\'s not my job to control him. He knows how to drive. And I\'m sure he knows that today was probably a bit over the limit.""', 'Verstappen, for his part, was not interested in getting into a public debate.', '“Twenty seconds is a lot,” he said. “But I am not going to cry about it and I am also not going to share my opinion. The biggest problem I had is that it was a bad day in terms of race pace.”', 'Verstappen still managed to finish sixth despite the penalties and an uncompetitive car. Norris took second, behind a dominant Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari, which might not have been so dominant had Norris not been delayed behind Verstappen for much of the first stint.', 'That means Verstappen’s championship lead is down to 47 points with 120 still available over the remaining four races. Norris still needs to close in by nearly 12 points a race to become the world champion.', ""“It doesn't feel like I'm much closer than what I was,” Norris said. “But every point helps.”"", ""Norris calls Verstappen 'dangerous' as Sainz wins in Mexico"", ""How F1 'gladiators' became 'a thing of the past'"", ""FIA to revise guidelines after drivers' meeting"", 'It was the second race in succession in which Verstappen and Norris clashed, with a completely different outcome to a very similar - but not identical - move.', 'In the United States Grand Prix the previous weekend, Norris was penalised for overtaking off the track after trying to pass Verstappen around the outside and both ending up in the run-off area.', 'Norris, and the vast majority of his fellow drivers, felt that Verstappen’s driving had not been acceptable - he had come off the brakes to make sure he had reached the apex of the corner first, even though that meant he was going too fast to make the corner.', 'That triggered a specific part of the racing guidelines, which say that if the car on the outside is not ahead at the apex, it is not incumbent on the driver on the inside to give room on the exit.', 'But the drivers could see what Verstappen had done and that led to discussions with governing body the FIA in Mexico. The upshot was that the FIA agreed to revise the guidelines and bring the new text for approval to Qatar in two races’ time, taking into account the drivers’ views on this sort of “dive-bomb defence”.', 'So it looked after the clash between Verstappen and Norris on lap 10 in Mexico as if the stewards were actioning these conversations. And perhaps they were in a way. But the two incidents were different in that this time Norris had his car slightly ahead at the apex.', 'This meant that, when Verstappen again ran him off the track, according to the guidelines, Norris should have been afforded room. So when Verstappen failed to give him any, he was penalised.', 'Four corners later, it was even more obvious. Verstappen, now behind, lunged for the inside, they went off and another penalty was dispensed. Even Verstappen more or less admitted he was at fault there.', '“It just felt that the Turn Four was a bit more a question mark,” Verstappen said. “Turn Seven is what it is.', 'Norris explained the two incidents after the race in Mexico.', ""“Austin, I don't think anyone should have got a penalty,” he said. “Yeah, let's say we both kind of did things wrong. I feel like I was made to do something wrong."", ""“The majority of people, the majority of drivers feel like that was the same thing. That's why you've heard of some of the rule changes that might be coming and those types of things. It's because there's a common consensus that it wasn't correct what happened in the result that I had last weekend."", ""“Today, I think, was another level on both of those cases. I was ahead of Max in the braking zone, past the apex. I am avoiding crashing today. This is the difference. I don't see it as a win or anything like this, but it's more that I hope Max acknowledges that he took it a step too far.”"", 'Norris believes that Verstappen is saving his most extreme defence for him, because they are championship rivals. Just as Lewis Hamilton feels the same thing happened when he was battling with Verstappen in 2021.', ""“I go into every race expecting a tough battle with Max,” Norris said. “It's clear that it doesn't matter if he wins or second, his only job is to beat me in the race. And he'll sacrifice himself to do that, like he did today."", ""“But I want to have good battles with him. I want to have those tough battles, like I've seen him have plenty of times. But fair ones. It's always going to be on the line. It's always going to be tough with Max. He's never going to make anyone's life easy, especially mine at this point of the year.”"", 'Inevitably, the bosses of McLaren and Red Bull disagreed on the incident.', ""McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown said: “It's getting a bit ridiculous. I applaud the FIA stewards. Enough is enough. Let's just have some good clean racing moving forwards."", '""The stewards are on it. That’s clear by the penalties that were given. The stewards did a good job this weekend.”', 'Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, meanwhile, produced some data that he said proved Norris had braked later on the lap of the incident than he had on even his fastest lap of the race, and was never going to make the corner.', 'Then he accused Norris of deliberately doing this to ensure he had his nose ahead into the corner.', '“It used to be a reward of the bravest to go around the outside,” Horner said. ""We are in danger of flipping the overtaking laws upside down, where drivers will just try to get their nose ahead at the apex and then claim they have to be given room on the exit.', '“You can see quite clearly he has effectively come off the brakes, gone in super late to try to win that argument the way these regs are written. And then at that point you are penalised.”', 'The irony - that Horner was accusing Norris of doing on the outside exactly what Verstappen had done in Austin on the inside, but saying it was wrong when saying what Verstappen did in Texas was fine - was obvious.', 'Norris and Verstappen have battled several times on track this season', 'Sainz, who had started from pole but lost the lead to Verstappen at the start, was already back past the Red Bull before the incident with Norris happened.', 'But the Turn Eight incident lost both Verstappen and Norris a place to the other Ferrari of Charles Leclerc, and Norris then spent the rest of the first stint stuck behind Verstappen, while the Ferraris of Sainz and Charles Leclerc built a lead.', 'And after Verstappen finally pitted out of Norris’ way on lap 26, the Briton lost further ground in the three laps before his own stop.', 'But once back out on track on the hard tyres, Norris was the fastest man, and began to slowly claw back his deficit.', 'He was on Leclerc’s tail with 12 laps to go, and pressured him into an error, allowing the McLaren to slip by into second place.', 'McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: “At the start of the race in the first stint, I thought this is probably not making a big difference because I thought the Ferraris are faster today.', '“But as we were going through the first stint, as soon as Lando got clear of Verstappen, he showed he had very competitive pace, and in the second stint he proved he was as fast as Ferrari.', '“So in hindsight now, when I look at the incidents, there is a little bit of disappointment because without that I think Lando could have fought for victory.”', 'Battle is rejoined in Brazil this weekend, the last of three back-to-back races. There is then a three-week gap before another three races on consecutive weekends end the season.', 'Ferrari’s one-three moved them ahead of Red Bull into second in the constructors’ championship, which now looks to be a straight fight between McLaren and Ferrari, with Red Bull out of contention.', 'Whoever wins it, it will be quite the story, as McLaren have not been champions since 1998 and Ferrari not since 2008.', 'Verstappen said that far more important than the penalties, the “biggest problem was we had no pace.” But his lead in the drivers’ championship is comfortable enough that Norris needs his rival to retire from a race to have a realistic chance of becoming champion, even if Red Bull continue to struggle.', 'Verstappen says: “I’m not worried (about the championship) but I also know we can do better than this. We need to improve our car. I am only thinking about how I can be faster.”', 'And Red Bull’s problems do not end there. Sergio Perez had what Horner described as “a horrible weekend again”, finishing last after a messy race. And Horner refused to commit to keeping the Mexican in his seat, even for the rest of the season.', '“We have done everything we can to support him and will continue to do so in Brazil, but there comes a point in time when you can only do so much,” Horner said.', '“The scrutiny will always be there, and there comes a point in time when difficult decisions have to be made.”', 'Verstappen did not say after the race whether he would amend his approach to wheel-to-wheel racing from now on.', '“I just drive how I think I have to drive,” he said. “Last week it was all right, this week 20 seconds penalty.', 'But was a new line in the sand drawn in Mexico?

The stewards deemed near-identical Sergio Pérez incidents with Liam Lawson and Lance Stroll needed no further action, continuing the infuriating theme of inconsistency in decision making from FIA's maligned stewards. There was no doubt about the second, though."", ""Verstappen drove off the track at Turn 8 to keep Norris behind him; no attempt to make the corner, just ensuring he emerged ahead. It's a move out of the Verstappen playbook many in F1 have seen before."", 'As seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton saw drama unfolding ahead of him on the 11th lap of the race, he had no doubt about who had caused it.', '""I could see a group of cars ahead, and I saw a plume of smoke, of dust, and I knew [who] it must have been,"" he said after the race. It\'s hardly a surprising viewpoint.', 'The 2021 title fight between Hamilton and Verstappen is legendary and featured three on-track collisions and a number of other flashpoints between the pair. Hamilton\'s Mercedes teammate George Russell referenced that title battle in his own media session, saying: ""I\'ve not seen anything like that since probably Brazil.""', ""The reference is to Brazil 2021, when Verstappen drove his car off the race track to keep Hamilton behind in a pivotal race in that year's championship bout. The move went unpunished at the time and is easy to overlook, as Hamilton passed Verstappen cleanly a lap later and went on to win the race, but clearly it has set a precedent. Verstappen delivered a carbon copy on Norris in Mexico City on Sunday."", '""This guy is dangerous,"" was Norris\' verdict on the radio immediately afterward. ""I just had to avoid a crash. It\'s the same as last time.""', ""Speaking after finishing second, Norris echoed what had been implied in Hamilton's statement to the media: with Verstappen, the playbook is often the same."", '""I knew what to expect,"" Norris said. ""I didn\'t want to expect such a thing, because I respect Max a lot as a driver, but I was ready to expect something like this. This is not very clean driving, in my opinion, but I avoided it and it was a good race.""', 'Norris elaborated on that viewpoint in the news conference that followed for the top three finishers.', '""I think it\'s pretty self-explanatory on what happened,"" he said. ""I go into every race expecting a tough battle with Max. It\'s clear that it doesn\'t matter if he wins or second, his only job is to beat me in the race. And he\'ll sacrifice himself to do that, like he did today.', '""But I want to have good battles with him. I want to have those tough battles, like I\'ve seen him have plenty of times, but fair ones. It\'s always going to be on the line. It\'s always going to be tough with Max. He\'s never going to make anyone\'s life easy, especially mine at this point of the year, but I think today was just ... It was not fair, clean racing, and therefore, I think he got what he had coming to him.""', 'Norris added: ""I hope Max acknowledges that he took it a step too far.""', 'Verstappen did not acknowledge that. Replying to a question about the Norris incident during his post-race media sessions, he said: ""We didn\'t touch, so, just racing hard.""', 'Katie George, Nate Saunders and Laurence Edmondson geek out about Formula One and the personalities behind it on ""Unlapped,"" ESPN\'s weekly F1 podcast. Listen to \'Unlapped\'', 'Verstappen often follows a similar pattern when it comes to answering questions about his driving style: deny, deny, deny, or deflect, deflect, deflect. He was doing the latter on Sunday.', '""The problem is that we are too slow and that\'s why I\'m being put in those positions, that is my problem,"" Verstappen said hours after the race.', ""The most frustrating thing about Verstappen is that he is good enough that he does not need to blur the lines in order to win races. He can race hard and fair; his aggressive style is why he quickly became one of F1's most popular drivers after making his debut at 17 years old. He reminded the paddock of that two laps before the Norris incidents, as Sainz passed him through Turns 2 and 3 for the lead of the race. Verstappen squeezed the Ferrari driver as much as he could without making contact."", ""Yet, when it was Norris in his mirrors two laps later, it's like a switch was flicked. It's natural to fight a championship rival harder than anyone else, but Verstappen's idea of where the line is between fair and unfair appears different to any of his rivals."", 'He would not be the first driver to have had that trait. Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher were unapologetically willing to overstep the mark in order to win races and championships, and Verstappen appears to encapsulate that mindset more than any other driver in the modern F1 era.', 'Norris himself has been criticised for being too passive in his fight with Verstappen, but that raises a different question: Is Norris being passive, or is it passive in relation to what Verstappen is willing to do in the same situation?', 'Lando Norris is initially forced off the track by Max Verstappen in an attempt to overtake the Red Bull driver, then both drivers go off track when Verstappen attempts to overtake Norris.', '""I\'ve always fought fairly. That\'s who I am. That\'s who I am as a racer,"" Norris said on Sunday. ""That\'s my way of driving every day. Maybe sometimes I\'ve lost out because I\'ve been too fair and not aggressive enough. And that\'s where I have to find a better balance.""', ""Late in the race, Hamilton and Russell enjoyed a close-but-fair battle between, leading to the latter to throw shade in the Red Bull driver's direction."", '""It was nice to have the battle, and I mean it\'s always good when you fight with Lewis because it\'s hard and fair,"" Russell said. ""At the moment you\'re seeing a number of manoeuvres that are just, you know, it\'s getting beyond entertaining or beyond sort of sporting, it\'s just almost unfair to a point now.""', ""F1 will return to Brazil next week and the references to 2021 and to Verstappen's recent string of incidents will once again dominate the headlines. All that chatter does a disservice to what the three-time world champion has achieved this season."", ""The Dutchman's style can often be used as a stick to beat him with, but his is a truly special Formula 1 career unfolding. It was clear from the moment Verstappen debuted in 2015 that he was destined for great things, but this year has been a hallmark of how a champion drives."", ""So often dominant champions are written off as products of a dominant car, but in 2024 Verstappen has done what all the greats manage: he's won when the car was unbeatable but, crucially, he has delivered time and time again when it wasn't. Whether it was the win in Canada, the sprint victory in Austin or the run of top-six finishes either side of the summer break as Red Bull's RB20 seemed to get worse with every grand prix, Verstappen has delivered points across the season in fantastic ways. His most painful loss of points, one that may well end up costing Red Bull the drivers' title, was when a brake fire forced him to retire from the lead of the Australian Grand Prix in April."", 'Verstappen is never going to stop racing hard: his aggressive style is what has earned him millions of fans worldwide as one of the most exciting racing drivers to ever grace the Formula 1 grid. When he oversteps the mark in a way only he seems able to do, though, he deserves to be called out: the Mexico City Grand Prix was one of those moments.', '', '', '']"

I really needed it also for myself – I wanted to get it done,” the Spaniard said. “I’ve been saying for a while I wanted one more win before leaving Ferrari and to do it here in front of this mega crowd is incredible.', '“Now, four races left, I want to enjoy as much as possible, and if another one comes, I will go for it!”', 'McLaren’s Lando Norris came home to take second place, with the Brit involved in a couple of chaotic moments.', 'Norris qualified third and closed up to the back of title rival Verstappen after Sainz had taken the lead. He attempted to overtake the Dutchman on lap 10, but Verstappen took a very wide line at Turn 4, forcing Norris onto the grass.', 'The McLaren driver came out in front of the three-time champion after cutting the corner before the pair clashed again. Verstappen attempted to retake P2 going into Turn 8 but ran wide again, this time taking both drivers off the track as Sainz’s teammate Charles Leclerc scampered past both drivers into second.', 'Both incidents were investigated by the stewards, with Verstappen being handed two separate 10-second penalties for forcing a driver off the track and leaving the track and gaining an advantage.', 'He served the penalties during his pit stop on lap 27, as Red Bull mechanics stood by the car for what felt like an eternity as they waited for the 20 seconds to expire before servicing the car.', 'This removed Verstappen from podium contention and he eventually finished the Grand Prix in sixth place.', 'Norris said after the race that he “knew what to expect” from the Dutchman and described his rival’s driving as “not very clean,” though the championship leader was keen to move on.', '“At the end of the day, if you agree with it or not, it doesn’t matter because the penalties are given,” said Verstappen. “That was also honestly not my biggest problem of the race, my biggest problem was that we just had no pace. Just struggling a lot on the tires, couldn’t really attack, and I couldn’t follow Ferrari and McLaren.”', 'Norris overtook Leclerc for second late on in the race, as the Monegasque driver had a huge wobble at the final corner that almost sent him into the barriers. Leclerc did take P3 to secure Ferrari’s second double-podium in as many weeks.', 'With the result, Norris now trails Verstappen by 47 points, having started the day 57 behind.

When he did not, the penalty was inevitable.', ""How F1 'gladiators' became 'a thing of the past'"", 'Full race results', ""FIA to revise guidelines after drivers' meeting"", 'Verstappen, who had been repassed by Sainz for the lead on lap nine, tried the same tactic as in Austin.', 'Norris was attacking him on the outside of Turn Four, three laps after a restart following a safety car caused by a first-lap crash, and Verstappen ran in late on the brakes on the inside and forced Norris off the track on the outside of the corner.', 'Norris took second place from Verstappen by cutting across the grass, missing the right-hander that makes up the second part of the chicane at Turns Four and Five.', 'Then at Turn Eight Verstappen went to re-pass. Norris said after the race that he was not trying to let him past because he did not feel he needed to. And as Verstappen dived for the inside, he ran wide and both cars went off the track.', 'Norris, talking about the Turn Four incident over the radio, said: “I was ahead the whole way through the corner. This guy is dangerous. I have to avoid a crash.”', 'Verstappen did not take kindly to the penalties, and his race engineer Giampiero Lambiase told him they came after a lot of “whingeing”.', 'Norris held the extra point for fastest lap for a long time, but it was initially taken from him by RB’s Liam Lawson, who stopped late for fresh tyres, and then Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who did the same with two laps to go.', 'Sainz’s victory, coupled with Leclerc’s third place and fastest lap, moves them ahead of Red Bull into second place in the constructors’ championship.', 'McLaren still lead, but Ferrari are only 29 points behind and 25 ahead of Red Bull.', ""Tsunoda's crash on the first lap brought out the safety car"", 'At the front, Sainz made it three Ferrari wins in the past five races after taking pole position, despite losing the lead to Verstappen on the first lap.', 'The race was immediately put under the safety car after a collision between Williams’ Alex Albon and Yuki Tsunoda’s RB led to the Japanese crashing at the first corner and Albon pulling off with damage after Turn Three.', 'When the race resumed, Sainz took just a lap before he passed Verstappen into Turn One, after which Norris closed in, leading to all the drama between the title contenders.', 'That allowed Leclerc through into second place and initially he tracked Sainz closely, and was within a second by lap 14.', 'But he dropped back a second the following lap, whereupon Sainz came on the radio to make an unspecified complaint about Leclerc, using bad language.', 'Leclerc stayed within two seconds of Sainz for a further three laps, before starting to drop back rapidly, slipping to nearly eight seconds behind before they made their single pit stops.', 'No further communications were broadcast and there were no replays of whatever might have happened, so it remains to be seen whether the drivers will discuss it after the race.', 'From that moment on, Sainz was untroubled out front, and Leclerc was equally comfortable in second for a long time.', 'But after the pit stops, Norris began to eat into Leclerc’s lead. The Ferrari was 4.7 seconds in front initially but Norris cut it back by 0.2secs or so a lap until he was on Leclerc’s tail with 10 laps to go.', 'Coming around the final corner on lap 62, Leclerc ran wide, onto the dusty outside of the track, and then off the circuit, and Norris swept by into second place.', 'Behind the top three, the Mercedes drivers were locked in combat throughout the race. Russell overtook Hamilton on lap 14 and stayed ahead until the pit stops, but the seven-time champion came back at Russell in the second stint and was on his tail with 20 laps to go.', 'They battled closely for many laps and eventually Hamilton found a way by into the first corner with five laps to go.', 'Behind them, Verstappen had no pace after his penalty and had a lonely race to sixth place.', 'Haas’ Kevin Magnussen took seventh, ahead of McLaren’s Oscar Piastri, eighth from 17th on the grid, Haas’ Nico Hulkenberg and Alpine’s Pierre Gasly.', 'Fernando Alonso, celebrating his 400th grand prix, retired early on with overheating brakes.', ""Verstappen’s team-mate Sergio Perez had a race to forget.
