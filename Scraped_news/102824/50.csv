Jayden Daniels was less certain, but ended up starting despite a rib injury. That set things up well for a matchup that was flexed into a prominent afternoon window.', 'The defense from both teams also deserved top billing, with several huge plays that made scoring touchdowns hard. The Bears offense in particular looked disjointed in the first half, turned it around a bit in the fourth quarter, but a miraculous Hail Mary by Daniels and the Commanders gave Washington an incredible win here at Northwest Stadium.', 'Let’s take a look at the most important stats, moments and takeaways from this Week 8 contest:', 'Bair’s breakdown', 'The Bears offense looked so explosive during their three-game win streak, scoring tons of points while featuring their full complement of skill players in the run and pass.', 'That unit was a shadow of itself coming out of a Week 7 bye, struggling in every area during this matchup with a Washington Commanders defense that had struggled at times this season.', 'Caleb Williams wasn’t accurate. Poor line play – influenced by Braxton Jones’ knee injury – kept the rookie quarterback under near-constant duress. It didn’t seem like Williams and his receivers were in lock step, with some pass attempts not headed where the receiver went.', 'The Bears defense, as it is known to do, clamped down in the red zone and kept this one close heading into the fourth quarter.', 'D’Andre Swift made it even closer with a 56-yard touchdown run. And the defense started getting stops over forcing field goals.', 'Williams found a late rhythm and got the Bears to the 1-yard line, but a botched handoff between him and offensive lineman/fullback Doug Kramer botched the handoff exchange on third down. Yeah, you read that right. Kramer got a carry attempt.', 'But the defense got yet another stop and the Bears drove deep into Commanders territory, at the 1-yard line with 30 seconds left, and, like good teams do, the Bears came through in the clutch.', 'Roschon Johnson scored the go-ahead touchdown with 23 second left. While the offense was terrible most of this game. It came through when it mattered most.', 'But the defense couldn’t hold serve, and Jayden Daniels just stole the show with a touchdown pass as time expired.', 'The Williams and Daniels show didn’t disappoint, but the Bears came out on the wrong end of a difficult result. Had the offense been steadier early, this game might not have been so close at the end. — Scott Bair', 'Key stat', '41.7%', 'Caleb Williams was brilliant in the fourth quarter — he was a perfect 3-for-3 on the penultimate drive that ended in a fumble at the 1-yard line — but struggled for much of the game. Williams finished 10-for-24, as he underthrew and overthrew open receivers on would-be big plays. If he had been able to complete a few more of those passes — does that result in longer drives and more points?', 'The Bears will never know, but Williams and the Bears will need to make sure those types of performances can be mitigated moving forward.', 'Pivot point', 'The Bears seemed destined to snatch an improbable win. Instead a 52-yard Hail Mary on the final play of the game gave the Commanders the most unlikeliest — yet probably deserving — 18-15 win.', 'The Commanders rookie QB kept the play alive then fired a ball short of the endzone, one that was swatted before falling into the hands of Noah Brown. It was an improbable play, yet the simplest of catches Brown will have had to make in his career.', 'What’s next', 'The Bears will go back on the road (again) to face an Arizona Cardinals team riding a two-game winning streak after beating the Chargers and Dolphins.

"This team, this quarterback, this finish — it can’t be real",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/10/27/jayden-daniels-commanders-dream/,"['Jayden Daniels is a fantasy, and the Commanders are basking in it.', 'We have officially entered a fever dream with the Washington Commanders. Where players and coaches are breaking free from the sideline, flooding the field like a tidal wave of joy. Coach Dan Quinn is throwing off his headset, searching for someone to hug, then later in the locker room finding that special someone standing near the starting quarterback’s stall.', 'A helmetless Frankie Luvu is shouting in his teammates’ faces, and a still-helmeted Emmanuel Forbes Jr. is showing compassion to heartbroken Chicago Bears players, so frozen in shock they cannot peel their backsides off the grass. Go-go music is blasting throughout Northwest Stadium, and no one wants to go home. The people are dancing and looking silly and rapturous while doing so. Then they move the party to the concourse, where they screech “M-V-P! M-V-P!” and into the parking lot, where they still can’t believe what they just witnessed.', 'Was what happened Sunday night a dream? A mass hallucination simultaneously experienced by 64,704 people in Landover, Maryland? If it was, please don’t wake us up.', 'In a play that will forever live on his career highlight reel, the rookie quarterback tossed a game-winning touchdown for 52 yards with time expired to shock the Bears, the greater Washington region and the whole dang league. Because somehow, someway, these Commanders are 6-2 and flexing atop the NFC East standings, simply from now having a leader.', 'Jayden Daniels is making Washington’s dreams come true.', 'On this day, Daniels had a case of bad ribs — he spent his time off the field wearing heavy wrap around his chest and sides — but the injury did little to affect his rifle arm. With two seconds remaining and then ending, Daniels danced in the pocket, rolled to his right and didn’t like what he was seeing, so he scrambled back to his left. Finally, he stepped forward, and stepped and stepped again, until he could launch the pass that should allow him to never pay for a meal in Washington again. And after this lovely mess, the beauty and brutality of sports unfolding in Week 8, CBS reporter Tracy Wolfson found the quarterback. As pandemonium broke out around him, somehow, Daniels wore a placid expression.', '“Nothing but God,” Daniels calmly told Wolfson, his explanation for how a ball stayed in the air that long, only to bounce off the hands of a chirpy Bears defensive back and right into the waiting gloves of Noah Brown.', 'When team minority owner Mitchell Rales left the celebratory postgame locker room, his expression was not like the too-cool-for-you Daniels. Rather, he was overcome and undone. Rales was walking with his entourage of young family members, chuckling and believing a higher power must have carried that Hail Mary. Because when you’re part of the ownership group that saved this franchise from Daniel Snyder’s hell, you’re allowed to believe in divine favor.', '“We had them the whole game, and then that’s what’s so crazy about it. In the old days, it would have been …” Rales was saying to a few reporters, then he stopped himself.', '“It’s just a miracle. This is just like someone’s looking down on us.”', 'Or maybe someone’s helping them from the sideline. Nobody’s saying Commanders tight ends coach David Raih was responsible for this play working, but that man is a Hail Mary magnet. According to tight end John Bates, Raih has claimed to players that he has witnessed four long, game-winning touchdown passes. Add one more.', '“That’s his fifth Hail Mary that he’s been a part of that’s won [his team] the game,” Bates said. “He is a lucky charm.”', 'It wasn’t luck, however. Just Daniels playing as the best rookie in the 2024 draft class.', '“We’re [blessed] to have 5 leading this team,” Brown said, using his quarterback’s jersey number. “The things he can do are special — just even that last play. Keeping his composure, fighting like hell to get the ball off and throwing a hell of a ball. I wouldn’t want to play with any other quarterback. I’m glad to have him.”', 'In a race, I’ll take Daniels against any secondary. This isn’t recency bias or homerism; did you watch Daniels against the Bears’ defensive backfield Sunday? Then you saw it. When Daniels, the rookie with the bad ribs, needed a first down while staring downfield against one of the best units in the NFL, he routinely beat one of Chicago’s defensive backs to the sticks. Pick one: Tyrique Stevenson, Josh Blackwell, Kevin Byard III — he smoked them all. (Stevenson had quite a day; besides getting into a back-and-forth with wide receiver Terry McLaurin and giving his team an unnecessary roughness penalty, he was the one who knocked the Hail Mary pass to Brown — after taunting fans and acting chesty when he thought his team was about to win.)', 'In the air, I would take Daniels, too. The fact that the Commanders couldn’t score a touchdown until the very last play should not blemish Daniels’s day. He connected on a deep ball with McLaurin (his longest completion of the season at 61 yards) and consistently moved the offense down the field. The real problem: drops in the middle of the field from Austin Ekeler and Brown and a mishandled near-catch in the end zone by Zach Ertz. The Commanders reverted to their Week 2 shenanigans by spoiling trips to the red zone and settling for field goals. But that wasn’t Daniels’s fault. He finished with 326 yards on 21-for-38 passing and one spectacular touchdown.', 'Pick any pivotal moment in this sloppy marquee matchup in the CBS 4:25 p.m. slot — such as, in the fourth quarter with Washington pinned deep in its own territory — and Daniels either made a play or the right decision. Which is why, in a choice for franchise quarterback, I would take Daniels over Chicago Bears rookie Caleb Williams.', 'Surely, the Commanders are thankful Daniels fell to the No. 2 selection in the 2024 NFL draft behind Williams, the No. 1 pick. At this point, they would take Daniels any day and twice on Sunday. Especially this particular Sunday, when Williams showed his competence late on two potential scoring drives but otherwise spent the majority of the game playing panicked or just plain bad: 10-for-24 passing for 131 yards with no touchdowns.', 'At times after facing Washington’s defense, Williams looked beat, as though he needed Len Dawson’s pack of cigarettes so he could re-create that famous photo of a dog-tired quarterback smoking his pain away. On the other end was Daniels, the leader who looked ho-hum about his Hail Mary, creating scenes that will be long remembered in Washington.', 'What happened here felt like a dream. Only better. Daniels is the fantasy come alive, the quarterback capable of making Washington believe again.', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience. Choose your plan →', '']"
NFL roundup: Commanders beat Bears on Jayden Daniels’ last-gasp Hail Mary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/nfl-roundup-sunday-football-scores-results,"['Jayden Daniels connected with Noah Brown on a 52-yard Hail Mary as time expired to give the Washington Commanders an 18-15 victory over the Chicago Bears.', 'Daniels scrambled for several seconds before heaving the ball from the Commanders 35-yard line. It was deflected just short of the goalline and fell into the arms of Brown, who was standing alone in the end zone.', 'HAIL NOAH!!!!!!!!!!\n\n📺 #CHIvsWAS CBS pic.twitter.com/nRr3sIF17K', 'Chicago had taken their first lead with 23 seconds left in the game, going ahead 15-12 on a one-yard TD run by Roschon Johnson after a pass-interference penalty on the Commanders (6-2). The Bears (4-3) had their winning streak snapped at three after falling behind 12-0 and giving up the Daniels-to-Brown play that sent players and fans in the stands into a frenzy.', 'The unlikely TD was Daniels’ 21st completion on 38 attempts while playing through a rib injury that left his status uncertain until hours before kickoff. In the NFL’s sixth matchup of rookie quarterbacks taken with the top two picks in the draft, Daniels threw for 326 yards and ran for 52.', 'Brock Purdy threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score to send the San Francisco 49ers into their bye week on a high note with victory over the Dallas Cowboys (4-4). The Niners (3-4) bounced back from a loss last week in a Super Bowl rematch against Kansas City with a strong performance that they hope will set them up for another big push in the second half of the season. Purdy led three straight touchdown drives to turn a 10-6 halftime deficit into a 27-10 lead. But San Francisco had to hold on late after Dak Prescott threw two TD passes to CeeDee Lamb to cut the deficit to six.', 'Jameis Winston threw a 38-yard touchdown pass – his third of the game – to Cedric Tillman with 59 seconds left as the Cleveland Browns beat Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens (5-3) to snap a five-game losing streak. Making his first start in two years and replacing injured starter Deshaun Watson, Winston helped the Browns take down their AFC North rival. But only after surviving a late comeback attempt by Jackson, who drove the Ravens to Cleveland’s 24 in the final seconds. Jackson threw two incompletions into the end zone, the second to Zay Flowers as time expired. Winston finished 27 of 41 for 334 yards in his first start since 25 September 2022. Winston did what Watson couldn’t as the Browns (2-6) scored their most points this season and he eclipsed 300 yards passing, something his teammate hasn’t done in 19 starts over three seasons in Cleveland.', 'Jared Goff threw three touchdown passes and David Montgomery was the first of five players to score in the first half for the Detroit Lions, who romped past the Tennessee Titans. The NFC North-leading Lions have the conference’s best record at 6-1. They have won five straight, averaging 40-plus points over the last four. Detroit had their highest-scoring game since a 55-point performance against Chicago in 1997, and scored at least 50 for the fourth time in franchise history. The Titans were routed for a second straight week to fall to 1-6.', 'Jalen Hurts rushed for three touchdowns and passed for another TD, helping the Philadelphia Eagles pound the Cincinnati Bengals 37-17 for their third consecutive victory. Hurts was 16-for-20 passing for 236 yards. He also had 10 carries for 37 yards. Saquon Barkey rushed for 108 yards as 5-2 Philadelphia won for the fourth time in five games overall. The Eagles scored the last 20 points of the afternoon. Cincinnati finished with just 58 yards rushing, continuing a season-long problem. Joe Burrow was 26 for 37 for 234 yards and a touchdown with an interception.', 'Rhamondre Stevenson plunged into the end zone with 22 seconds left and the New England Patriots recovered after first-round draft pick Drake Maye left with a concussion early to beat the New York Jets. Starter-turned-backup Jacoby Brissett replaced the quarterback who replaced him and led the Patriots on two fourth-quarter scoring drives to snap a six-game losing streak. The Jets and four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers have lost five loss in a row. Both teams look out of playoff contention with 2-6 records.', 'Josh Allen threw two touchdown passes and the surging Buffalo Bills (6-2) turned his first interception of the season into an afterthought. James Cook rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns for the AFC East-leading Bills, who were in control throughout and won their third straight. Allen finished 24 of 34 for 283 yards. He ran his streak of passes without an interception to 300 before Josh Jobe picked him off in the second quarter. But the Seahawks (4-4) turned the ball over on downs after that pick, and Buffalo responded with a 93-yard touchdown drive.', 'Jalen Hurts rushed for three touchdowns and passed for another TD, helping the Philadelphia Eagles pound the Cincinnati Bengals for their third consecutive victory. Hurts was 16-for-20 passing for 236 yards. He also had 10 carries for 37 yards. Saquon Barkey rushed for 108 yards as 5-2 Philadelphia won for the fourth time in five games. The Eagles scored the last 20 points of the afternoon. Cincinnati (3-5) finished with just 58 yards rushing, continuing a season-long problem. Joe Burrow was 26 for 37 for 234 yards and a touchdown with an interception.', 'Patrick Mahomes passed for 262 yards and two touchdowns and the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs remained undefeated with victory over Las Vegas. The Chiefs (7-0) extended their winning streak to 13 games, including the playoffs. Their last loss was at home to Las Vegas, but the Chiefs are 5-0 against the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium and 6-0 including the Super Bowl in February. Las Vegas (2-6) have lost four consecutive games. Mahomes became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 30,000 yards, doing so in his 103rd game. Indianapolis Colts 20–23 Houston Texans', 'CJ Stroud threw for 285 yards and a touchdown and Joe Mixon ran for 102 yards with a score to help the Houston Texans to a win over the Indianapolis Colts. Stroud bounced back after he had a career-worst 86 yards passing in a loss to the Packers last week to allow the Texans (6-2) to extend their lead atop the AFC South. Houston’s defense intercepted Anthony Richardson once and hurried and harassed him all game as the Texans swept their season series with Indianapolis (4-4) for just the second time in franchise history.', 'Kyler Murray drove the Cardinals into position for a game-winning field goal by Chad Ryland as time expired for the second straight week, and Arizona (4-4) spoiled Tua Tagovailoa’s return from a concussion, beating the Miami Dolphins (2-5) by a single point. Murray led two scoring drives in the fourth quarter to rally the Cardinals from a nine-point deficit. The first concluded with a two-yard touchdown run by James Conner that got Arizona within 27-25. The second was a methodical 13-play, 71-yard march that ended with Ryland’s 34-yard kick. Tagovailoa threw for 234 yards and the Dolphins had their best offensive performance of the season.', 'Kirk Cousins completed 23 of 29 passes for 276 yards and four touchdowns, leading the visiting Atlanta Falcons to victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Darnell Mooney had five catches for 92 yards and a touchdown, while Kyle Pitts hauled in four receptions for 91 yards and two scores as the Falcons (5-3) improved to 4-0 against NFC South opponents. Baker Mayfield completed 37 of 50 passes for 330 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions as Tampa Bay (4-4) lost their fourth game in six tries. Cade Otton led the Buccaneers with nine receptions for 81 yards and two scores.', 'Ladd McConkey had two touchdown catches, including a 60-yard score in the third quarter, and became the first Chargers rookie receiver in 11 years to have a 100-yard receiving game as Los Angeles (4-3) defeated the New Orleans Saints (2-6). Justin Herbert had 328 total yards as the Chargers bounced back from a last-second loss last Monday night at Arizona.', 'Backup Malik Willis completed a 51-yard pass to Jayden Reed that set up Brandon McManus’ second winning kick in as many weeks, a 24-yarder that lifted the Green Bay Packers to a narrow victory at Jacksonville. Willis rallied the Packers (6-2) to their fourth consecutive win, this one with Jordan Love watching from the sideline. Willis completed 4 of 5 passes for 56 yards, with a touchdown and the biggest completion of the day. Willis found Reed wide open down the left sideline after safety Andre Cisco fell down in coverage. It was all the Packers needed to rebound from Trevor Lawrence’s perfectly placed, 14-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram that helped tie the game for the Jaguars (2-6).', 'Bo Nix threw three touchdown passes and ran for another in the Denver Broncos’ victory over the injury-ravaged Carolina Panthers. It was Nix’s best game yet of his rookie season as the Broncos improved to 5-3 with their fifth win in six games. The Panthers lost their fifth straight and fell to 1-7. Bryce Young returned as the Panthers’ starting QB with Andy Dalton still recovering from a sprained right thumb he sustained in an auto accident on Tuesday.']"

Everyone involved knew it was a long shot, as rookie phenom Jayden Daniels approached the line of scrimmage with two seconds remaining and his team trailing the Chicago Bears, 15–12.', '“You have a jumper in the middle, then three guys looking for the tip—one in the front, two in the back,” says veteran receiver Noah Brown, one of the former Cowboys that Dan Quinn brought with him from Dallas in the offseason. “I happened to be in the back.”', 'It was from there that Brown made a miracle happen for the coach he followed from the Dallas Cowboys in Washington’s 18–15 win. But before all that, a lot of other things had to fall into place, starting with the guy who’d throw the ball to him even being available for the game.', 'Daniels sustained a rib injury in the Commanders’ Week 7 rout of the Carolina Panthers, and his status for the game against the Bears (and his showdown with the one player taken ahead of him in April’s draft) was up in the air all the way into the hours before kickoff. The quarterback sat out practice Wednesday, then participated in the Thursday walkthrough. On Friday, Daniels felt good enough to go, so Quinn wanted to push him to test his limits with his injured ribs.', '“Can he get outside the pocket? Can he throw on the run? Can he throw across his body? We really pushed it,” Quinn told me over the phone after the game. “We pushed him to see how he’d respond.”', 'Daniels told his coaches on Saturday, ahead of the team’s walkthrough, that he felt fine. So he went through that walkthrough—“just easy moving around,” per Quinn—and everyone had their fingers crossed he’d wake up and feel good again Sunday morning. The final test came during normal warmups at the stadium in the afternoon. But that just confirmed, after Friday’s tests that he was still good.', '“[Friday] wasn’t a scripted-play day, it was, Could he get off track and could he avoid and protect himself?” Quinn says. “Those were the things that we looked at. Went through the whole process and told him, If you don’t look like you, I’m going to pull you. I wanted to make sure he knew that it had to be him. He did a fantastic job.”', 'Physically, Daniels was there. Performance-wise, though, it wasn’t all the same. The Commanders moved the ball but stalled three times in the red zone in the first half. The only points in the second half, prior to the Hail Mary, came on a long field goal after Washington got the ball on a short field.', 'So the defense needed to come to play to make that last play possible, and it did.', 'Eventually, the Bears started to move the ball. D’Andre Swift ran for a 56-yard touchdown. And after one long drive was short-circuited by the Bears calling the William “the Refrigerator” Perry goal-line run back from the mid-1980s—the exchange between Caleb Williams and backup center Doug Kramer was fumbled and lost at the 1—Williams drove the Bears for the go-ahead points near the end of the fourth quarter.', 'After a well-placed kickoff forced a return, the Commanders’ offense trotted out with 19 seconds left, the ball at Washington’s own 24 and hope in short supply.', 'The initial hope was to get a chunk play, call the team’s last timeout, then run a sideline route to set up a game-tying field goal. But Daniels’s first throw, deep over the middle to Zach Ertz, fell incomplete with 12 seconds left. Which shifted the plan to a simpler one—get the ball into range to throw the Hail Mary. So Daniels threw again to Ertz, this time for 11 yards, then called the timeout. After that, he found Terry McLaurin for 13, and McLaurin quickly got out of bounds at Washington’s 48-yard line with those two seconds to spare.', '“That’s the one you need,” Quinn says. “If we don’t get that play to him, then we’re out of gas.”', 'But they did, and in went the call, Hail Mary.', 'At the snap, Brown flew down the field and worked, as Daniels bought time, to get behind the defense. His normal landmark—“the top of the letters in the end zone, you get yourself some space, so that if the ball does fall back like that that you’re not out of bounds”—would change a bit, because the throw was short. But as the crowd gathered around Ertz, the jumper on the play, Brown got himself about five yards back and, to his surprise, he was alone.', '“I just got into the end zone, tried to box my defender out, keep him behind me,” he says. “He ended up in front of me, but so did Zach.”', 'Chicago’s Tyrique Stevenson went to bat the ball away. Instead, Ertz batted it back. You know the rest.', '“The biggest key, when you go back to watch it, it’s Zach Ertz tipping it,” Quinn says. “And it’s so hard to catch. [Ertz] was the one that went up to knock it up, and then it went behind to Noah. There’s a reason they don’t work very well, and a reason it’s called Hail Mary. The fact that Zach was able to get a hand on it to keep it alive, I thought that was the real key. Jayden did a good job of buying time.', '“Some people all-out blitz it. Some people rush three and drop everybody back. The whole key is it’s got to get into the end zone by tip or by the throw. Jayden did a good job of buying time. Nick Allegretti might have strained to make a block at the end to give himself a chance to throw it. It was wild.”', 'For Quinn, it was historic, too. He mentioned how hard it is to complete a Hail Mary. He knows, because he’s never been on either side of one in a game. Brown told me he hadn’t, either. Kingsbury has—he was the Arizona Cardinals’ coach for the 2020 Hail Murray—but there were plenty more on the Commanders’ sideline like Quinn and Brown.', 'And for the record, while Jim Nantz and Tony Romo wondered on the broadcast whether Daniels’s rib injury would allow him to make that throw (they suggested that the Commanders could bring in Marcus Mariotta for the heave), Quinn had no doubt. During that Friday workout, he said, “he ripped one 60-something yards.”', 'So he knew Daniels would get the ball where it needed to go.', 'Of course, the chances it’d land in a Commanders player’s hands in the end zone was always a long shot. Then again, for even the most ardent believers of Quinn and new GM Adam Peters, so too was the idea Washington would contend in those guys’ first year. Or at least it was to those who weren’t in that building.', '“I’m not surprised,” Brown says. “I know what happens when you put in hard work. I know what it looks like. We have all the ingredients to do that here. We have all the guys who come in and work day in and day out. As long as we continue to do that, the success will continue.”', 'On Sunday, it did in a most unconventional way.', 'Luck was part of it, of course. It just wasn’t the only part of it.', 'The Cleveland Browns’ players, so you know, see Jameis Winston the same way you do. Receiver Cedric Tillman, one of the heroes of Sunday’s upset win over the Baltimore Ravens, said as much over the phone after the game, describing his own reaction to Cleveland’s new quarterback’s quick-to-go-viral pregame speech.', '“I’m not gonna lie,” Tillman says, “I was laughing a little.”', 'It was easy to laugh afterward, too, given the day the Browns just had, and what Winston brought to them in spades—a palpable energy that everyone could feel.', 'The stories coming back from Browns 29, Ravens 24, of course, will lead to bigger-picture questions (we’ll get to those, too) about how Cleveland looked, again, without Deshaun Watson. But in the moment, the players involved were going to be careful, and Tillman was, about elevating one teammate at the expense of another. And the truth is just the surface part of Sunday’s story, a 1–6 team improbably upending a powerhouse, was good enough.', 'That’s especially true with the way it ended because it sure looked like Baltimore, in the waning moments of the fourth quarter, had finally delivered the dagger to kill off the underdog with a six-play, 91-yard drive featuring three plays of 20-plus yards. Derrick Henry’s two-yard touchdown run made it 24–23 with 2:36 left. Lots of punches had been thrown by both sides at that point. It wouldn’t have been a surprise to anyone to see the mighty Ravens deliver the knockout blow right there.', 'Instead, Winston quickly moved the ball downfield. Tillman for 12. Jerry Jeudy for 11. Elijah Moore for seven on third-and-7. And then, after a penalty, on a second-and-15 from the Ravens’ 38, it was the Browns swinging, rather than absorbing.', '“They went to a man look,” Tillman says. “We had a dagger concept, kind of left me on the safety going across the field. I just tried to get open, and Jameis made a great throw.”', 'The rest is history. ', 'The 38-yard touchdown put Winston at 334 yards and pushed his passer rating to 115.3. And a Browns team that won 11 games starting five different quarterbacks a year ago had reason to believe again.', 'Of course, the elephant in the room is there, too. The Browns looked crisper, more explosive and more efficient in one game with Winston than they have in the previous seven with Watson. And after Joe Flacco played the way he did last year leading the team’s late-season surge, a lot of people will be convinced now—and it’s a fair thought, for sure—that Watson is the problem, not the solution, and is weighing the team down with a contract the franchise can’t get out of.', 'But this week, the Browns’ focus was on Winston, who just a week ago had to deal with being demoted, for game-plan reasons, to third string. How he handled it was another reason why the players rallied so hard behind him. Among other reasons.', '“I’ve been saying it, Jameis has been the same guy week in and week out, no matter what his role on the team was,” Tillman says. “Jameis has been talking about when the opportunity comes, we all got to be locked in.”', 'Winston was, from the very start, with a speech that amused—and did inspire, too.', '“We just always got to listen to the message,” Tillman continues. “Yeah, it can be a little funny, but the message of this team is important. He brings that energy.”', 'And the Browns responded in a way they haven’t in a while.', 'The Cardinals are tied for first in the NFC West and deserve your attention. There were signs this could happen last year—and in particular in a late-season road win that wounded a spiraling Philadelphia Eagles team headed for the playoffs. There is talent, too.', 'The question, then, was when the competitive losses would become wins.', 'Answer: The past six days. On the heels of a 17–15 Monday-night win over the Los Angeles Chargers that came down to a buzzer-beating, game-winning field goal from Chad Ryland, the Cardinals one-upped themselves in a short-week game staged at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on the other side of the country. They did it against a desperate Miami Dolphins team getting the lift of Tua Tagovailoa’s return. They did it even though the Dolphins led 27–18 with less than 10 minutes left.', 'This 28–27 win in South Florida was more than just the case of the Cardinals winning a game. It was showing that a very young team now is learning how to win.', '“I think we’re just staying together, believing in the plan that we have and the guys in the huddle,” one of the game’s stars, third-year tight end Trey McBride, said afterward. “We know that we’re going to fight until the very end. We’re going to give it everything we got until the game’s over. That’s exactly what we did.”', 'In doing so, and putting together an eight-play, 70-yard touchdown drive; then a 13-play, 73-yard march to set up another Ryland buzzer-beater, the Cardinals proved a few things.', 'The first was that Kyler Murray has really grown up. He doesn’t stay back in Texas for the offseason program anymore, and it seems, to those in the building at least, like he took the criticism on his work ethic (you’ve heard the Call of Duty jokes) to heart. Second-year coach Jonathan Gannon’s staff hasn’t seen that guy—they’ve seen one who won very big in high school and college, and sure seems determined to do it again in the pros.', '“The guy’s a great leader,” McBride says. “He’s an elite athlete, a guy who’s had a lot of success in his life. Heisman winner. The guy’s a freak. Just to have him on our team, to know that he can extend plays at any time, he’s been great. This year has been awesome. He’s bringing everybody around, leading the team the right way. I love the guy. I’m willing to go to war with him every week. He’s my quarterback. ... I’m very proud of him.”', 'Then, there’s his budding No. 1 receiver—who’s proving the Cardinals right on how they used the No. 4 pick in the draft.', 'Marvin Harrison Jr.’s stat line (six catches, 111 yards and a TD) doesn’t fully explain how important the reigning Biletnikoff Award winner was to the Cardinals on Sunday. On the touchdown drive, he tracked down a wayward Murray throw to pick up 16 yards on third-and-4. On the game-winning drive, he converted second-and-15 with an 18-yard catch, made over the middle, while getting crunched between two Dolphin DBs. And that was after he toasted Jalen Ramsey for a touchdown earlier in the game.', '“The confidence in Marvin is through the roof,” McBride says. “He’s such a great player, great pro. Kyler has that confidence in him, I think the whole team does as well. What a great opportunity for him to have that big catch in the corner of the end zone and then help us march down to win the game. I’m just so proud of him.”', 'So McBride is proud of Murray, just as he’s proud of Harrison—and, really, the whole operation, which is the other piece of this.', 'Being able to grind out wins like these in succession shows the young core starting to grow up and figure it out. It doesn’t mean the Cardinals are suddenly any sort of favorite in the NFC West. But when they landed back in Phoenix late Sunday night, they did so in a tie with the Seattle Seahawks for first in a tight division race (and the San Francisco 49ers joined those two teams at 4–4 on Sunday Night Football). And based on the youth of the roster, and the number of young players being counted on, the Cardinals should keep getting better from here.', 'At the very least, that’s how they see it playing out.', '“We just have a belief in our coaches, belief in our team,” McBride says. “Second year with this staff, the offense is coming a little easier, coming a little quicker to everybody. Most importantly, I think guys are believing in what we’re doing here, believing in our plan. J.G. and [GM] Monti [Ossenfort] have done a great job of building a great team.”', 'And maybe the Cardinals aren’t there, as a great team, yet.', 'But they’re absolutely on the way up.', 'Jerod Mayo passed a significant test Sunday. A lot was made of the New England Patriots coach’s comments after an ugly loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Mayo called his team soft. It wouldn’t be a run-of-the-mill comment for any coach, let alone a first-year head coach, or one who didn’t provide some “gotta coach it better” qualifier beforehand.', 'To me, from there, two things were relevant.', 'The first was what Mayo had said to his players privately. I was told, after doing some digging, that Mayo’s address to the guys after the Jacksonville loss struck the same chord as the postgame presser. In other words, he called them out for a lack of physicality in the game that was disturbing for a staff trying to build a hard-edged program. The second would be how the team would respond.', 'And we have our answer to that now. The Patriots took it to the New York Jets—over and over again Sunday—eventually putting together a 12-play, 70-yard drive, capped by Rhamondre Stevenson scoring on fourth-and-goal from the 1 with 22 seconds left in a 25–22 win. They survived a quarterback injury. They got a stop on a two-point conversion (with an assist from the Jets’ coaches) that proved pivotal. They looked, well, not-so soft after all.', '“You just take it and you essentially have to prove him wrong,” says backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who came in for a concussed Drake Maye. “I think the guys, throughout the week of preparation, went out and responded the right way. Today was the fruit of the labor. Hearing that, nobody wants to be called that, especially as a team.”', 'Now, Mayo did walk his comment back a bit last Monday, a day after he first fired the salvo.', 'But by then, the damage had been done. And the critics—including Mayo’s legendary predecessor, Bill Belichick—were circling. As such, the Patriots’ response would be scrutinized, with a desperate Jets team that routed New England in September coming in.', 'Then, Maye was taken to the locker room to be evaluated for a head injury. And by the time Brissett, benched two weeks ago, entered the game, the Jets were up 13–7.', 'So this team trying to prove its coach wrong was being led by a player trying to do the same.', '“I’ve been in this league for a while, and I understand how fast this league works,” Brissett says. “It’s being ready to go at any moment’s notice. When these opportunities come up, it’s even better when you can go out there and, I don’t want to say prove people wrong, but I would say prove yourself right.”', 'Brissett did the rest of the afternoon, and did so despite his receivers dropping balls left and right. He, like his team, hung in there, and had the wherewithal to make his biggest plays when it mattered most, on the drive to win the game. First, there was a 14-yard scramble to convert third-and-9. Then, he made a courageous throw for 34 yards to Kayshon Boutte, one of the guys who’d battled drops, made while taking a massive hit.', '“The safety came—he’s not paying attention to the X [receiver], he’s thinking that we’re going to throw the ball over the middle of the field based on his game-film-watching,” Brissett says. “Boutte just did the rest. I thought I underthrew it a little bit, but Boute made a hell of a play and went up and came down to the ground and caught it. I didn’t think I was going to get hit, but I did. He did the hard work.”', 'And after that came the straight-forward gap run to win the game on fourth down, a call that’ll test a team’s, and its opponent’s, toughness in a very real way. Consider that test passed now, and Mayo’s questions answered. “[That run is] a testament to this team and what we’re trying to build,” Brissett says. “That was a great tool to build off of and for guys to learn about the culture that we’re trying to set here and the team we’re trying to build.”', 'It also showed, in a pretty real way, that the Patriots are tuned into what Mayo’s saying.', 'Which, in the end, is the most important part. Mayo took a lot of shots last week, from a lot of places. His players, who took a shot of Mayo’s own, had his back all the way through.', '“I don’t know what Bill said, that’s between them two,” Brissett says. “The guys wanted to come out here and respond. We’re not coming out here to lose. We’re trying to win. Things haven’t gone our way the last couple weeks. I think today was a testament of what we’ve been building.”', 'And, perhaps, a bit of a turning point for Mayo, as the new boss in Foxborough.', 'It sure feels like the Detroit Lions are the best team in the NFL, and my favorite set of stats this season really explains why. Last week in the space, for transparency’s sake, I advocated for Jared Goff to be a real MVP candidate. This week? He played well again … but the Lions didn’t exactly ask him to do a ton of heavy lifting.', 'The numbers tell the story.', '• The Lions had 61 net yards passing and scored 52 points.', '• When Goff took his first snap of the second half, Detroit had nine net yards passing and 42 points. At that point, Goff had a 118.8 passer rating.', '• In the first half, the Lions had three touchdown passes on nine pass attempts (two from Goff, one from David Montgomery).', 'So some might look at that and see an indictment on Goff, even if he was super-efficient with what Detroit needed from him. I’d take the opposite view—that Sunday’s 52–14 beatdown of a bad Tennessee Titans team was a vivid display of exactly how complete Detroit is. And running through how the Lions scored all those points shows it.', 'The first touchdown was scored on a short field generated by a pick. The second came on a 70-yard Jahmyr Gibbs run. A 72-yard kickoff return gave the Lions another short field for the third touchdown. The fourth, like the first, was set up by an interception putting the offense deep in Tennessee territory. The fifth came with a long punt return setting up a short field. The sixth was a punt return touchdown. The seventh was a short field created by a forced and recovered fumble.', 'A field goal that capped the scoring at the end of the third quarter actually came off the closest thing the Lions had to a sustained drive—they went 48 yards in eight plays to set up Jake Bates’s 51-yard field goal.', 'So if you’re scoring at home, the defense set up two scores with picks and another off a fumble. The special teams set up two more with kick and punt returns, then scored another on its own with a punt return. And the run game, which finished up with 164 yards, hit a home run, too.', 'That, folks, is damn impressive.', '(Yes, Goff is still an MVP candidate. He did, after all this, finish 12-of-15 for three touchdowns and a 129.9 passer rating.)', 'The 49ers got through by the skin of their teeth, and the bye week should give them the reset they need. There won’t be an exhibit in Canton showcasing the first eight weeks of the 2024 Niners’ season anytime soon. They had holdouts and injuries, and even went through a scary real-life situation in the case of Ricky Pearsall.', 'All the same, the way Sunday night’s game with the Cowboys ended wasn’t ideal, either.', 'What was a very real get-right performance from the Niners for a good 50 of the evening’s 60 minutes started to come undone. Dallas put together twin 70-yard drives to cut what had been a 27–10 advantage with under 10 minutes left to 30–24. The Niners then yielded a big sack, went three-and-out, and Dak Prescott and the Dallas offense got the ball on their own 25 with 3:05 left.', 'From there, the Niners got the four-down stop they needed, and Isaac Guerendo, in for Christian McCaffrey stand-in Jordan Mason, churned out 22 yards on three carries to get San Francisco into victory formation, and to 4–4, which is even with the Cardinals and Seahawks in the NFC West, and a half-game up on the Los Angeles Rams.', 'It’s not where the Niners expected to be. But given, well, everything, it’s also not the end of the world, especially if the team gets just a little healthier over the week off.', 'While Brandon Aiyuk’s not coming back, there’s a good chance McCaffrey will be back out there practicing after the bye. He’s continued to work forward in a very deliberate rehab plan—ramping up over the past few weeks without the Achilles flaring up again. Deebo Samuel and George Kittle have gotten healthier in recent weeks, too. And Pearsall, who’s flashed potential, should get his feet underneath him.', 'The hope would be, from a coaching standpoint, the same happens on defense as players get more and more comfortable in new DC Nick Sorensen’s system.', 'Now, are the Niners going back to the Super Bowl? I don’t know.', 'What I do know, however, is that counting them out would be ignoring history. The 2021 49ers started 3–5 and ended up in the NFC title game. The ’22 49ers got back there, too, after a 3–4 start. And while last year’s team started 5–0, those Niners went into the bye on a three-game losing streak, at 5–3, and somehow cleaned it up in time to make the Super Bowl.', 'Which is why, to me, Sunday was about survival for the Niners. They got that, and now we’ll see where they can take things next, with a quarterback who’s more battle-tested, and a team that’s been forced to be a little more resourceful.', 'The New York Jets’ season isn’t over, but it sure is teetering. To me, the most damning, and least excusable, moment of a very ugly loss came after New York scored its final points of the day—when Braelon Allen barreled in on second-and-goal from the 2 with 2:57 left. It put the Jets up 22–17, and in the obvious spot where they’d have to go for two and try to push the lead to seven.', 'The offense stayed on the field. With around five seconds left on the play clock, it became clear Aaron Rodgers and the other 10 guys in the huddle wouldn’t be able to get the snap off. Rather than call a timeout, Jets coach Jeff Ulbrich let the clock expire. A flag was thrown.', 'From there, Rodgers threw a slant to Mike Williams from the 7, he was tackled inside the 5, and that opened the door for the Patriots to go win the game outright in regulation.', 'To me, the lack of readiness of the offense to go for two, and of the coaching staff to manage the situation correctly, was mind-blowing. It showed a staff that’s struggling in the aftermath of losing its leader, Robert Saleh, and having to shift roles around and assimilate new pieces such as Davante Adams and Haason Reddick over the past few weeks.', 'It’s also, to me, indicative of a franchise that seems to be wildly pulling levers in search of some sort of fix for everything that’s wrong. First, it was the firing of Saleh that the locker room was confused by—with the players feeling like losing him would stretch the staff thin and hurt a defense that was the strength of the team. Second, it was going the extra mile to land Adams before the Pittsburgh Steelers game, despite the fact that the Jets didn’t have an offer on the table for him, period, before Saleh was fired', 'So now that those fixes have failed … what’s next?', 'The 6–2 Houston Texans are next on the schedule. Houston will come to the Meadowlands on Thursday with a chance to put the Jets’ season on life support. If it’s not there already.', 'The Minnesota Vikings, now 5–2 and riding a two-game losing streak, are in a fascinating spot. To be clear, I still really love where they are from a building standpoint, and their trajectory for the rest of this year. The Vikings get the Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans the next three weeks before what is shaping up to be a pivotal NFC North showdown in Chicago just before Thanksgiving.', 'That said, the fallout from Thursday’s loss to the Rams should test the team in some pretty interesting ways.', '• The left tackle situation isn’t great after Christian Darrisaw tore his ACL and MCL. He was playing Pro Bowl–level ball, and justifying the contract he got in the offseason—and the drop-off going to David Quessenberry in the second half was obvious (Minnesota rushed for 20 yards on 10 carries after the break, and Sam Darnold was under constant duress).', 'As bad as the injury is (spare me the takes on kneeling out the first half, because it’s football, and things happen), Darrisaw is 25 and it’s fair to think he’ll be able to return to form next year. So, it’s not like there’s a long-range issue here that calls for the Vikings to do something drastic. But bringing in an experienced hand such as D.J. Humphries, David Bakhtiari or Charles Leno Jr. might make sense. They could also look at moving right tackle Brian O’Neill, the bedrock of the line, to left tackle or shifting Blake Brandel from left guard to tackle.', 'The bottom line: While Darrisaw isn’t the team’s best player (that’s the guy who wears No. 18), he may well be its most irreplaceable one.', '• The future at quarterback is still TBD.', 'For the most part, Darnold played pretty well in his Southern California homecoming before the Rams’ defensive front took over late after the Darrisaw injury. And he’s been consistent, and proven to be a good fit for the Vikings’ offense. As for what that means going forward, Kevin O’Connell has addressed the elephant in the room, and told Darnold to worry about having a good day, a good practice, a good game. After that, they’d all address what would be a very good problem down the line.', 'Meanwhile, rookie first-rounder J.J. McCarthy was part of the team’s traveling party for the first time. He went out to dinner in L.A. with the quarterbacks Wednesday night and was on the headset on the sideline Thursday night. He’ll be with the team going forward, but most of his focus is still on rehab. He’s building strength back now and isn’t yet at the point where it’s 50-50 rehab-to-football work, but he’s getting there.', 'McCarthy’s done a lot of rehab while his teammates are on the practice field, has participated in meetings and has a one-on-one meeting once a week with O’Connell.', '• The defense has taken it on the chin a little the past couple of weeks against the Lions and Rams, and it’ll be interesting to see the response there from a group that has some aging pieces (Harrison Smith, Stephon Gilmore), whose experience helps to enable the complex scheme Brian Flores is running. Whether those guys need to be paced a bit to make it through the year remains to be seen.', 'The Rams’ offense took center stage Thursday night, but the defense should take a bow for the way it played. And, to be clear, I’m not saying Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams or (certainly) Matthew Stafford shouldn’t be on that stage—they all did their part in what could be a season-shifting win over the Vikings.', 'I just don’t think folks should miss the job that Chris Shula is doing with the defense.', 'The 38-year-old is one of the few remaining coaches from Sean McVay’s original staff, brought over from the Chargers in 2017 by his old college buddy who was getting a shot to run his own ship. Because of that tight relationship, and Shula’s last name, McVay knew his close friend would have to earn any promotion he was given. So while McVay went and got Brandon Staley to replace Wade Phillips in ’20, and Raheem Morris to replace Staley the year after, Shula kept chipping away.', 'That’s why, in January, McVay pushed back against the idea that Shula had simply waited his turn the past seven years—knowing he’d really earned it.', 'And that’s shown up the past couple of weeks. Shula’s adjusted to playing out of more five-man fronts. He’s also gotten consistent improvement from the fleet of young guys the team has up front (Jared Verse, Braden Fiske, Byron Young), and great play from complementary pieces like Michael Hoecht. Verse has been disruptive from the jump as a rookie, and has gotten even more effective of late by playing within the structure of the defense, which highlights his shades-of-Terrell-Suggs skill set.', 'All of it, of course, is a nice complement to what Los Angeles is doing on offense with the aforementioned stars. The Seahawks are up next. There’s hope the offensive line will have both Steve Avila and Jonah Jackson back to take on the Dolphins in Week 10.', 'Perhaps it’ll be enough to make the team shift its team-building strategy a bit. Over the past week, the Rams took calls on Kupp and told teams it’d take more than what the Las Vegas Raiders got for Davante Adams to pry the franchise icon away. Now? It may be even tougher for the Rams to let Kupp go, which is a tribute to how the group is coming along on offense and defense.', 'It’s late Sunday night. And that means it’s time for the quick-hitters. Let’s roll …', '• The Kansas City Chiefs had a few packages in for DeAndre Hopkins, and maybe the most encouraging thing was where he got his two catches in—one was on the first third down of the game and the other was the final play before Harrison Butker banged home a 42-yard field goal at the end of the first half. They weren’t nothing plays where you’re just trying to get a guy’s feet wet.', '• Sean Payton’s fake field goal on what would have been a 60-yarder in the fourth quarter, and trick play to convert fourth-and-2 with the Denver Broncos up 28–7 and less than five minutes left, were pretty interesting. Panthers corner Jaycee Horn took notice, for sure.', '• Bryce Young didn’t look much better than he did before he was benched, going 18-of-28 for 153 yards, a touchdown and two picks before engineering a 98-yard drive in garbage time. I still think Carolina should stick with him, to try to gather as much information as possible ahead of what could be a very big QB decision in a few months.', '• The Buffalo Bills are really good, and knew what they were doing when they turned the page on so many veterans this offseason. They’re three and a half games clear of the field in the AFC East, and it’s hard to imagine anyone catching them. Also, Keon Coleman looks like he’s on his way.', '• Speaking of young receivers, Ladd McConkey is another one who flashed big-time potential Sunday. The Chargers’ overhauled skill group is starting to come together, which could’ve been expected with Jim Harbaugh as coach.', '• They didn’t win, but the Dolphins looked like themselves again Sunday. The quick-twitch timing and anticipation throws built into their offense to highlight Tagovailioa’s greatest strengths were tough for Skylar Thompson and Tyler Huntley to execute at a high level, which led to some frustration among receivers that seemed to melt away Sunday. In a wonky AFC, Miami might still be able to make a run.', '• I’d be a little worried about Anthony Richardson’s development, if I were the Colts.', '• Conversely, the Texans are showing they don’t need C.J. Stroud to be Superman to win. Stroud’s been good-not-great the past couple of weeks. But we all know what he’s capable of, and maybe we’ll see it Thursday night in Jersey, with Houston in position to deliver a death blow to the Jets’ season.', '• It seems like the Philadelphia Eagles have started to find their identity, now seven games into a season with two new coordinators. That game in Cincinnati sure looks like it sent two teams in different directions. The Eagles have won three straight going into a showdown with old friend Doug Pederson next week.', '• Trade deadline-wise, there will be a lot of focus, as always, on the receivers. But I’d keep an eye on the edge-rusher market, too, where Cleveland’s Za’Darius Smith, Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney, Green Bay’s Preston Smith and New England’s Josh Uche are among the bigger names available. Just eight shopping days left!', '• And don’t think I ignored the Atlanta Falcons completing their season sweep of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and taking control of the NFC South.

Because some of these divisions (*cough* NFC North *cough*) are much stronger than others (*cough* NFC West *cough*) it’s important to make that distinction, even this early in the 2024 season.', 'The Green Bay Packers continue to survive the play of backup quarterback Malik Willis, who has now had to contribute significantly in three games this season, but how much of a lead has the team built up to this point? We’ll try to answer that question and more in our NFC outlook.', 'All of the division leaders, other than the 4-4 Cardinals are in outright control of their division. Arizona currently holds the tiebreaker over the 49ers and Seahawks, who are also 4-4 coming out of Week 8.', 'In an interesting coincidence, the Packers hold a small lead over the Vikings and Eagles, who are the only teams that Green Bay has lost to this season, in the Wild Card race. The Vikings dropping back-to-back games against the Lions and Rams have gone a long way for pushing the Packers up the standings, as they are now holding the top Wild Card spot after being on the outside looking in for the postseason just two weeks ago. If Green Bay ever does slip up in a week when Minnesota and Philadelphia win, though, they’ll find themselves behind those teams not only in the tiebreaker but also in record.', 'Another big break for potential Wild Card teams is that the Bears lost on a last-second Hail Mary versus the Commanders, which led to them falling below the playoff cut if the season were to end today.', 'Week 8 also saw the Falcons register another win over the Buccaneers, meaning that they have swept them for the season. Tampa Bay is Atlanta’s primary threat in the NFC South, as the Saints and Panthers combine for a 3-13 record up to this point.', 'As far as next week goes, some important NFC versus NFC games include Bears-Cardinals and Rams-Seahawks, which will be important for jostling in the NFC West and Wild Card, but the main attraction is Lions-Packers, which will feature teams that combine for a 12-3 record in 2024. At the moment, there’s still no word on whether Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love, who dropped out of the second half versus the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday with a groin injury, will be healthy enough to suit up in that game.', 'For those of you interested in next year’s draft order, the Saints and Panthers are set to face off, too. New Orleans started the season 2-0 before dropping their last six games.

Tory Taylor's individual effect on the game was enormous, as impactful as one can imagine it can be from that position."", ""But no team should win a game when it decides to try a handoff to a backup center for his first career rushing attempt. Not in a conference game on the road, not in that situation in anything that counts, ever. There's zero justification for it. The Williams/Doug Kramer fumble is the kind of mishap that gets people fired."", ""Meanwhile, the Bears came out of their two-week break reverting to old mistakes and bad habits. Their eight penalties included pre-snap hiccups and post-whistle composure issues, and Matt Eberflus again failed to challenge a completed pass that merited a much longer look. What's more, the game ended with all three of the Bears' second-half timeouts unused. Not burning more time before the late Roschon Johnson touchdown run was a choice."", ""So was the defense on the final play, with no designated safety playing behind the landing spot of the Hail Mary pass. The ball is expected to be tipped, and there should never be an uncovered receiver like that. The Bears played well enough on that side of the ball, until they just didn't."", ""This one stings most because of the shock of the ending, but attention to that will temporarily distract from plenty of serious issues for the Bears. The offensive line is a mess, play-calling is again suspect and Jayden Daniels is better than Caleb Williams right now. Such a substandard performance out of the bye week would've been wallpapered over by a victory."", 'As the Bears try to pick up the pieces and salvage their postseason chances before the start of divisional play, try this for a thought exercise:  imagine if that were a playoff game.', 'Dan Bernstein is the co-host of the Bernstein & Harris Show on middays from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on 670 The Score.

Chicago Bears defensive back Tyrique Stevenson broke the cardinal rule of defending a Hail Mary play and tipped the ball in the air, sending it floating into the end zone."", ""Then came the eucatastrophe. The ball dropped into Noah Brown's hands, and jubilant chaos ruled the night at Northwest Stadium. Players stormed the field, the crowd roared and coach Dan Quinn threw off his headset with a smile on his face as the team and fan base celebrated Daniels and Browns' improbable play to give the Washington Commanders an 18-15 win over the Bears and a 6-2 record for the first time since 2008."", ""Daniels' touchdown pass, which put him at 326 yards for the night, was the reward for the waves of anxiety and stress the team and fan base had experienced for the past week as they monitored the quarterback's rib injury. Daniels was eventually cleared, but it wasn't a sure thing that he would play at all until hours before kickoff."", ""And then there was the game itself, which never felt like it was in Washington's full control even with a two-score lead in the third quarter. Similarly to their Week 2 win over the New York Giants, the Commanders had to settle for field goals thanks to a myriad of drops and penalties that could have broken the game open much earlier in the evening. Had it not been for the defense forcing Caleb Williams and the Bears to punt seven times, things might have been even more dire."", 'But even after one of its sloppiest performances of the season from the offense, the unit found a way to get into the end zone when it mattered most, even if it took a full 60 minutes of game time to do so. A 13-yard completion to Terry McLaurin set the Commanders up at their own 48-yard line, and Daniels and Brown took care of the rest.', ""Why the Commanders even needed the Hail Mary in the first place is the result of several head scratching and frustrating moments that the offense simply didn't capitalize on.

Next, on third-and-4, Zach Ertz couldn't maintain possession on Daniels' throw to the end zone. The score was 9-0 after a third Seibert field goal, but it felt like Washington was barely clinging to the lead."", ""Washington's defense was what made the offense's three field goals good enough to build a lead. Williams and the Bears couldn't do much against the Commanders, as their pass-rush led by Frankie Luvu contained the No. 1 overall pick and forced him to make errant throws. They attempted to create some momentum with a fourth-down conversion at their own 40-yard line, but Benjamin St-Juste snuffed out a screen pass to DJ Moore, holding the receiver up long enough for Luvu and the rest of his teammates to join in on the tackle."", ""The Bears' last attempt at getting points on the board before halftime was ruined by the Commanders' front seven. Williams, who finished the night with 131 passing yards on 10 completions, tried to escape on third-and-12 but could not, resulting in a 15-yard sack that knocked the Bears out of field goal range before halftime."", ""From that point on, it looked and felt like the Commanders' offense was out of sync in a way that it had not been all season. Drives fizzled out in eight plays or less with drops or miscommunications. Despite getting the ball at the Chicago 41-yard line on their second possession of the third quarter, all the unit could manage was 12 yards -- just enough to put Seibert in range to tack on another field goal to make the score 12-0. Even more frustrating on that series was that a touchdown from Olamide Zaccheaus on third-and-1 was nullified because of another illegal player downfield penalty."", ""The Bears didn't have much more success, but they found enough to help swing momentum in their favor. D'Andre Swift broke loose on a jet sweep to the left, riding the sideline on the way to a 56-yard touchdown. They also got down to the 1-yard line two drives later, but Williams' handoff went awry and fell into the hands of Johnny Newton, who had three tackles and three quarterback hits."", ""But after a quick three-and-out from the Commanders' offense, the Bears were right back in scoring position eight plays later.

Bears' Tyrique Stevenson taunted Commanders fans before giving up Hail Mary TD,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bears/2024/10/27/tyrique-stevenson-chicago-bears-hail-mary-washington-commanders/75887298007/,"['LANDOVER, Md. – Somehow, handing the ball off to an offensive lineman for a fumble on the goal line with the game hanging in the balance wasn’t the most embarrassing thing the Chicago Bears did Sunday against the Washington Commanders. ', 'Tyrique Stevenson made sure of that by taunting the home crowd at Northwest Stadium, which would have been fine had the Bears hung onto a 15-12 comeback victory. Instead, footage taken from the crowd and posted on social media showed Stevenson distracted and taunting fans as Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels snapped the ball and Commanders receivers dashed downfield for a Hail Mary. Stevenson eventually realized there was an actual NFL game still taking place and that he was a participant – an active one at that. The cornerback jumped with the rest of the mass of humanity as Daniels’ last-gasp pass approached, and he helped tip the pigskin backward to a waiting Noah Brown, who caught the 52-yard touchdown with no time on the clock for a stunning 18-15 win. ', '“We’ve practiced that play a hundred times,” said Bears head coach Matt Eberflus, who said he’d have to look at the tape to figure out what went wrong. ', 'The Bears are coached, Eberflus said, to have one defender on each receiver essentially boxing out like a basketball player going for a rebound. A free defender is responsible for going up to bat the ball down. Another defender has the job of being “the back-tip guy who goes around the pile,” Eberflus said. ', 'Whoever that was, Eberflus would not say.  ', 'All things Bears: Latest Chicago Bears news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.', ""“That's a hard way to lose,” he said. "", 'Was the “back-tip guy” not there? ', '“I got to look at it,” Eberflus said.  ', 'Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson said “there should never be somebody wide open in the back of the end zone.” ', '“I can’t tell you who was supposed to be there,” he said. ', 'The play was bad for the Bears defense in real time and unforgivable due to the viral video. Stevenson did not speak with the media after the game and Eberflus was not specifically asked about his antics.', '“To Chicago and teammates my apologies for lack of awareness and focus …. The game ain’t over until zeros hit the clock,” Stevenson wrote on social media after the game. “Can’t take anything for granted. Notes taken, improvement will happen.” ', 'Chicago safety Kevin Byard III confirmed that defenders are supposed to box out their assigned man while someone goes up to knock the ball down. Washington tight end Zach Ertz was able to help force the ball back into the end zone. ', '“Big pile of people, I know guys are trying to box out,"" Byard said. “But at that point, you can’t just grab guys and tackle them.', '“We can talk about the details and all of that, I just know it’s a tough play overall – because like I said, how much time he had, you got to run around, and guys are doing the best they can to get around their guy.” ', 'The Bears rushed three defenders and Daniels held the ball for 12.79 seconds before firing it, according to Next Gen Stats. Eberflus acknowledged his defense could have brought extra pressure and noted that linebacker T.J. Edwards became a non-factor because he was assigned to cover running back Austin Ekeler, who was blocking. ', 'As the Commanders home stadium and sideline exploded in jubilation, the Bears were left shell-shocked.', ' “You don’t really believe your eyes at the time,” wide receiver Keenan Allen said. “It’s like, ‘Damn, did it really just happen? Are there any flags?’” ', 'For all of their troubles, the Bears were a yard away from taking a fourth-quarter lead. ', 'Doug Kramer Jr., a backup offensive lineman wearing No. 68, lined up in the traditional fullback spot and reported as eligible as the clock ticked toward six minutes remaining with the Bears facing a third-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams took the snap, turned and presented the ball to Kramer. Within a fraction of the second, the ball was loose and in the hands of Commanders defensive lineman Jer’Zhan Newton. ', '“It’s the play we’ve worked,” Eberflus said. “We’ve just got to do it better.” ', 'The coach added: “It’s just wedge blocking. You’re on the 1-yard line. You got a big guy getting the ball. We’ve practiced it a lot.” ', 'Williams said his comfort level in the play was “100 percent.” The rookie quarterback was credited with the fumble officially. ', '“I know that mistake is bothering (Kramer), but I’m proud of the guys,” said Williams, who made his return to the area in which he grew up and was 10-for-24 for 131 yards passing. ', ""Kramer, 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds, is no William “Refrigerator” Perry. He grew up near Chicago in Hinsdale, Illinois, and attended Illinois for college. He certainly isn't the expected option to take a handoff in that scenario, especially in an offense that occasionally lines up tight end Cole Kmet at the fullback spot. "", 'Pressed again if he was on board with the logic of the call, Eberflus responded: “It’s a 1-yard play.” ', ""Unless it goes backward and is fumbled away. And without some self-reflection, the Bears' season could go that way, too, after a loss like this one.""]"
