The state recently announced the latest slate of projects that will receive tax credits in 2025, which include the pilot for “Suits: L.A.” and the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck-produced Hulk Hogan drama “Killing Gawker.”', '', 'However, the $750 million cap would still put California behind states like Georgia, which does not limit the amount of taxpayer money that can be returned to productions as tax credits.', '“I don’t know how long they’ll be able to afford that program,” Newsom said of Georgia. “We’ll see how long that lasts down in Georgia.”', 'The governor went on to claim that a more competitive California tax credit should make it easier for politically progressive filmmakers to boycott filming in Georgia for political reasons.', '“Compare the values of this state, with how it relates to workers’ and women’s rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights down in the state of Georgia,” Newsom said. “I think it’s a pretty damn easy decision for those who make those decisions. If you believe in those values, I hope you can express them by moving your feet. Not just praying, not just talking about them, but actually coming back to the state of California.”', 'The announcement couldn’t have come soon enough for film industry workers and small business owners in Los Angeles who have been hurting for work. FilmLA recently reported that Summer 2024 had the second lowest number of film, TV, and commercial shoot dates of any summer on record. Production was even slower this summer than in 2023, when Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild strikes brought the majority of scripted production to a halt. In addition to larger industry contractions, Los Angeles has been particularly hurt by unscripted and reality TV productions moving to other states, with shoot dates in that sector declining by 56.3 percent in Q3.', '', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

,https://www.shootonline.com/article/gov-newsom-proposes-expansion-of-californias-tax-credit-program-for-film-and-tv-production/,"['Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed expanding California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program from the current $330 million annual allocation to $750 million annually. The massive increase to the program, which is administered by the California Film Commission (CFC), would allow California to outpace other states offering tax credits, luring more entertainment industry projects back to the Golden State.', '“California is the entertainment capital of the world, rooted in decades of creativity, innovation and unparalleled talent,” Governor Newsom said. “Expanding this program will help keep production here at home, generate thousands of good paying jobs, and strengthen the vital link between our communities and the state’s iconic film and TV industry.”', '“California needs to keep pace with competing states and nations in providing aggressive tax incentives,” said Colleen Bell, director of the California Film Commission. “The Governor’s bold plan will accelerate these efforts and assure California remains the production center of the entertainment industry.”', 'The economic value of increased production pays dividends on different fronts:', '–A study of the tax credit program found that, for every tax credit dollar approved, it generated and created at least $24.40 in output, $16.14 in GDP, $8.60 in wages, and $1.07 in initial state and local tax revenue resulting from production in the state.\n–Since its inception in 2009, California’s Film & Television Tax Credit Program has generated over $26 billion in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.', 'According to Bell, the program has been oversubscribed year after year, with more productions applying than can be accommodated under the current budget cap. The results have been tangible. In recent years, projects unable to secure California’s tax credits moved to other locations. That migration caused significant economic losses, with an estimated 71% of rejected projects subsequently filming out-of-state. Many other projects chose not to apply due to the limited funding, suggesting that total runaway production losses are likely much higher.', 'For example, between 2020 and 2024, data shows California lost an estimated $1.6 billion in production spending due to limited tax credit funding, directly impacting state jobs and local economies.', 'Despite these challenges, the CFC has enjoyed some major recent wins through the tax credit program, including:', '–September 2024: Indie films and “Suits LA.” $51.6 million to support 19 projects, including 15 independent films. Expected to generate $284.4 million in spending, with $112.1 million allocated to wages, and over 3,800 jobs.\n–July 2024: Five new TV projects, including HBO’s “Latitude” and 20th Television’s “All’s Fair.” $58 million in tax credits went to five television projects, which was expected to generate $386 million across 438 filming days. Estimated to support 15,869 background performers, 1,196 crew members, and 685 cast members.\n–March 2024: Amazon’s Fallout relocated to California. $152 million in tax credits went to 12 projects, including Fallout’s second season relocating from New York. Projected to bring in over $1.1 billion in spending across the state and support 4,500 cast and crew members, plus 50,000 background performer days.\n–December 2023: The Mandalorian & Grogu to film in California. With a total of $400 million allocated to 15 projects, including Lucasfilm’s The Mandalorian & Grogu alone that was set to inject $166 million into California’s economy. Nearly 20,000 jobs created, including 2,252 crew and 598 cast. Other productions included “The Accountant 2” by Amazon Studios, “Untitled 20th Film,” Disney’s untitled live-action feature.', 'In 2023, Governor Newsom signed a five-year extension of the program, including new workforce diversity provisions, more funding for the Pilot Career Pathways Training Program, and the nation’s first Safety on Production Pilot Program. Furthermore, tax credits will become refundable for the first time since the program’s inception in 2009, beginning with the 2025-26 fiscal year, with Program 4.0 set to commence on July 1, 2025.', '""Venom: The Last Dance"" showed less bite than expected at the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote franchise\'s previous entries. Projections for the third ""Venom"" film from Sony Pictures had been closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from the first two ""Venom"" films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2 million, while the 2021 follow-up, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" opened with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the pandemic. ""The Last Dance,"" starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most comic-book films. But ""The Last Dance"" is also performing better overseas. Internationally, ""Venom: The Last Dance"" collected $124 million over the weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China. That\'s good enough for one of the best international weekends of the year for a Hollywood release. Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience scores (a franchise-low ""B-"" CinemaScore) have been good for the film scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel. The low weekend for ""Venom: The Last Dance"" also likely insures that superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years, not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment. Following on the heels of the ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" flop, Gross estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about...
