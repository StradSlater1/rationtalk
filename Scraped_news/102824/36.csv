Apple’s smart display might aesthetically revive the iconic iMac G4,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/apple-smart-home-display-imac-g4-design-base-report/,"['Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?', 'Apple’s foray into the smart display segment is eagerly anticipated, and if Bloomberg’s numerous reports are anything go by, we could see the first entry hit the shelves as early as 2025. Now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his PowerOn newsletter, reports that the upcoming machine could borrow some inspiration from the legendary iMac G4.', '“The screen is positioned at an angle on a small base, making it reminiscent of the circular bottom … from a couple of decades ago,” Gurman writes.', 'Now, the iMac G4 holds a special place in Apple’s hardware history. Steve Jobs, co-founder and then-CEO of Apple, reportedly drew inspiration from designer Jony Ive when developing the next Mac desktop.', 'Upon its launch over two decades ago, Jobs went gaga over “the biggest change in desktop computers” with the iMac G4 and the long list of upgrades it brought to the table. “This is the best thing, I think, we’ve ever done,” Jobs was quoted as saying at the packed Macworld event.', 'To this day, the swiveling arm design of the LCD panel connected to a hemispherical base is considered one of the best ever to come out of Apple’s famously secretive design labs. It seems that for its next big adventure with an entirely new product category, Apple is borrowing from one of its most arresting hardware endeavors ever.', 'Bloomberg’s report notes that the screen on the upcoming smart home device by Apple will follow a square-ish format and will roughly be the “size of two iPhones side by side.” The base, on the other hand, will likely play host to the speaker assembly.', 'The device will primarily serve as a hub for controlling other smart home gadgets and accessories. Moreover, it will run its own custom operating system — which some rumors are referring to as homeOS. The overarching approach, however, won’t be too different from the iPad.', 'To that end, the upcoming smart display by Apple will reportedly play host to apps like Notes, Calendar, and FaceTime, among others. Apple is also envisioning it as a dynamic frame that will play a slideshow of pictures from the Photos library, alongside serving as a video-watching hub.', 'Notably, the device is also said to run the Apple Intelligence experience, which means it will pack some serious firepower under the hood. Interestingly, this is the lower-end smart display we are talking about here.', 'Apple is reportedly working on a higher-end model, as well, one that would include a robotic arm format and could cost somewhere around $1,000.', 'So far, the company has yet to offer any hint about its work on a new class of smart devices, but it certainly seems Apple wants to cram its AI stack in more places and grab a piece of the market where the likes of Amazon’s Echo Show have reigned supreme so far.', 'In the meantime, if you can’t stop your imagination from running wild, London-based designer Xhakomo Doda created concept renders of a revived iMac G4 design for the modern era.', 'Also, back in 2022, one hardware enthusiast crammed the mighty M1 silicon inside the iMac G4 chassis, giving it a modern makeover. It would be interesting to see whether Apple’s design team stays loyal to the original inspiration or gives us something entirely fresh next year.', 'We’ve been talking about the upcoming iMac Pro redesign for many months with the expectation it will be fitted with one of Apple’s M1 Pro or M1 Max chips. According to a reliable leaker, though, there’s going to be a surprise chip added to the line-up.', 'The news comes from the pseudonymous Dylandkt on Twitter, who has a good track record for Apple leaks. In a tweet, the poster claimed that “there will be an additional configuration for the upcoming iMac Pro beyond M1 Max. A 12 Core CPU configuration was tied to a snippet of code referencing the iMac.”', 'After the launch of its redesigned 24-inch iMac, Apple has begun production on a larger 27-inch variant, according to MacRumors. The report also says that the new iMac will feature a mini-LED display.', 'The report is based on new shipments from Apple suppliers. Components are being sent off to manufacturers for final assembly, which means the 27-inch iMac is likely in production and could ship in the spring of 2022.', 'There are plenty of portable displays on the market that allow you to mirror or extend the screen of your laptop while mobile, but Australian startup Espresso Display is bringing some new innovation to the space with its mobile touchscreen-powered screens.

Will it have a purpose? Here's what I hope to see from Apple's rumored smart display,https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-homepad-smart-display-3492513/,"['Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.', 'October 22, 2024', 'Smart displays have been around for years now, but the product category hasn’t seen the same level of momentum as smart speakers and security cameras. Apple may be hoping to change that, at least if recent rumors prove true. A recent report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims the company plans to tackle the smart home market in a bigger way with the introduction of several new products, including a home accessory widely speculated to be an Apple Smart Home Display.', 'If Apple is indeed working on its own smart home display, there are a few things I’d like to see from such a device if it wants to succeed where its contemporaries haven’t. Below is my wishlist and everything we currently know about the rumored display.', 'For years there have been rumors that Apple will enter the smart display market but the chatter slowed down until recently. In addition to Gurman’s report, there have also been leaks from MacRumors and 9to5Mac, and a few other publications that give us even more details. Apple reportedly intends to reinvigorate its smart home efforts through a combination of software, AI, and smart screens. The display will allegedly work similarly to an iPad but with a more affordable price point and comparatively limited functionality.', 'There are many form factors this device could take, though it makes sense that Apple might consider an approach similar to the Google Pixel Tablet, pairing a screen with a dock. However, if Apple takes this route, I hope they ensure the dock has HomePod-like functionality built-in, without requiring the screen. A minimally functional dock is one of the worst parts of the Pixel Tablet experience. If Apple does go down this road, I would vote to name the product the “HomePad.”', 'Unlike the Pixel Tablet, the Apple Smart Home Display is unlikely to run a full tablet OS, and rumors claim the company is working on a version of tvOS optimized for the screen. This new OS is reportedly codenamed “Plaster Board,” though its commercial name will likely be HomeOS. This platform is expected to offer more basic functionality compared to iPadOS but will likely still include features such as smart home device controls, media playback, a browser, video conferencing, and a few basic apps like Calendar.', 'As for when we might see the Apple Smart Home Display and other products of its revamped smart home effort, that’s less clear. Apple tends to play its cards close to the vest, and while the renewed leaks and rumors suggest a launch next year is a safe bet, there are no guarantees. A 2026 launch could be just as likely. We just don’t know yet.', 'Now that we’ve discussed what we know about the device, let’s look at some of the things I’d love to see from it.', 'While HomeKit is a powerful way to control your smart home devices, it has real limitations, especially with guest access. While it’s easy to invite iPad or iPhone users as temporary guests, not everyone will feel comfortable granting full access to a device outside their network, even temporarily. The current solution also requires the guest to have their own Apple device, which leaves out Android-owning friends and family members, as well as younger family members who don’t have their own iPhone or iPad.', 'The Apple Smart Home Display could provide the perfect solution. Imagine you have a visitor staying for a few days who wants to control a smart device, turn on lights, etc., but doesn’t have an iOS device. They could simply grab your Apple Smart Home Display. Apple is rumored to include a webcam in this display, which could be used to make the experience even more seamless by verifying the user via facial recognition. If the device doesn’t recognize the user, it could trigger a limited guest mode with access to only the smart devices you want guests to control.', 'Apple needs to learn from Sony’s mistake with the PlayStation Portal. While the device has its fans, its reception has been mixed because it’s just a screen with controllers built-in, fully reliant on the PS5. The Apple HomePad, or whatever it’s called, needs to be more than just a dummy screen with Apple AirPlay technology. Otherwise, people may struggle to understand why they need it when they could just use a phone or tablet.', 'Full direct access to video calling, streaming apps, and casual internet use is a must. Unlike the HomePod, it shouldn’t be tied to an iPhone or iPad for core functionality, including setup. Sure, your phone or tablet should be able to communicate with the HomePad via AirPlay, but the display should also function independently for basic tasks.', 'Making the HomePad more of a stand-alone experience could also help it appeal to Android users. I get that Apple likes controlling every aspect of its ecosystem, but there are many people impressed by Apple’s smart home platform who aren’t necessarily interested in an iOS or iPadOS device.', 'Apple’s smart display needs to carefully balance being a useful smart home hub while distinguishing itself from the iPad. If it looks or feels too much like an iPad, consumers won’t see the point. Why pay for an “almost iPad” when you could buy the real thing? At the same time, it’ll have trouble selling if it’s just a simple, semi-portable Apple AirPlay display with minimal smart home controls. It’s just too basic to be worth it.', 'There are a few ways Apple could approach this. At the very least, it starts with design. This product needs to scream “Apple” at first glance, but not “iPad.” That could mean rounded corners, a unique aspect ratio, or anything else to make it clear that this isn’t just another iPad while still having the signature Apple logo and other design elements. It should include simple apps and functions with features such as video conferencing, basic security cam features, and more — more or less like Google’s Nest Hub Max. Full smart home controls are a given, but it should also offer apps for browsing and more.', 'It also needs to do something better than the iPad or iPhone. Anything really, even if it’s just one niche feature. Whether that’s the guest mode I mentioned above or another unique function, there needs to be something this display can do that no other smart device can. Finally, its price needs to be low enough to attract consumers and make them choose it over an iPad. Ideally, that means a price tag at least $50 lower than the base iPad, but honestly, unless it has a significant edge like a higher-resolution webcam or easier guest access, it should be priced closer to $150 — over $100 cheaper than the base iPad.', 'Since we don’t know for sure when or if the Apple Smart Home Display will debut, I wouldn’t wait for it. In the meantime, you won’t find anything exactly like it, but you can find similar experiences. As we mentioned, the Google Pixel Tablet is one alternative. Though it’s received a mixed reception, it offers a full Android tablet with smart home capabilities.', 'If you don’t want a full tablet, the Echo Show or Echo Hub comes to mind. The Echo Show is essentially a stand-alone display with a built-in, non-removable dock, while the Echo Hub is more like a traditional tablet, designed for wall-mounting. If you’re not sold on Amazon’s ecosystem, consider the Google Home Hub Max, though it’s getting a bit dated, so I’d recommend the other options first.', '']"

According to insider reports, the tech giant is reportedly working on a smart home display combining the functionality of an iPad, Apple TV, and HomePod in one compact device. But what has Apple enthusiasts buzzing is the hint that this device could feature a retro design reminiscent of the beloved iMac G4, which has remained a fan favourite since its release in the early 2000s.', ""Reports of Apple's new smart display surfaced in Bloomberg's Power On newsletter by Mark Gurman, who detailed Apple's plans to expand its presence in the smart home market. Gurman's description reveals a device with a square screen, similar to an iPad in design, but scaled down to a unique size “about the width of two iPhones placed side by side.” The device sits on a small, angled base that is said to resemble the circular stand of the iMac G4. The iMac G4, affectionately called the “sunflower” Mac, is celebrated for its quirky and timeless look, and Apple appears set to revive this iconic aesthetic."", ""Alongside its display features, the new device could include speakers embedded within its base, effectively merging a HomePod-like audio experience with the functionality of a screen. If Apple follows this route, it would position the device as a direct competitor to Amazon's Echo Show and Google's Nest Hub, which have already gained traction in the smart home display space."", ""At the heart of this new smart home display will likely be Apple's A18 chip, a high-performance processor that could significantly enhance the device's capabilities.

Apple Intelligence includes features like voice recognition, predictive insights, and adaptive responses, making it more responsive and useful in everyday tasks."", ""Gurman's report also suggests the device could be priced affordably, likely in the same range as popular smart home displays. Apple reportedly aims to encourage users to set up multiple units around the home for easy access to streaming Apple TV Plus, making FaceTime calls, surfing the web, and managing everyday apps like Calendar and Notes.

Apple’s first smart home display could pay homage to a classic iMac,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24280830/apple-intelligence-smart-home-display-imac-g4-design,"['By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment.
