Two possible disturbances provide a ""high chance"" of a tropical depression or storm forming in these waters heading into the early part of November, he said.', '""The water temperatures are very warm, and we are expecting that the winds shear to be on the lower side,"" DaSilva said.

""The 2024 hurricane season punched us harder than any in a generation.""', 'The Northeast should be basking in fantastic candy-gathering weather − warm and dry.

Boston\'s forecast high is 78 degrees, New York could see 75 degrees on Halloween, Philadelphia 80.', '""It looks like the center of the country, the Plains states will be dry,"" DaSilva said. But, he said, a cold front pushing east could bring the threat of showers and thunderstorms from Ohio and Michigan all the way down to Louisiana and Texas.', 'The Central Plains, Rockies and Southeast will be dry, he said.

But there’s a chance that this system could end up as the final hurricane churning in the Atlantic before the oceans cool and the calendar flips to 2025.', 'It’s worth noting that, even if a storm forms, the odds of a U.S. impact are slim.', 'Only four hurricanes in the past century and a half have struck the Lower 48 during November; records date back to near 1850.', 'The Atlantic has had a busy season.

We’ve had 15 named storms, including 10 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes (category 3 or higher).', 'Hurricane Milton will be the strongest hurricane of 2024 in the Atlantic Sector. Peak winds with the storm briefly reached an estimated 180 mph. The storm made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida and produced peak wind gusts of 90-105 mph on land.', 'Since Milton, we’ve had “Nadine”, which was a tropical storm from October 19-20. It came onshore near Belize City. There were five fatalities, from flooding, landslides and one where someone touched a live electrical wire. Quintana Roo reported 3.5″ of rain.', 'Interesting note: The remnants of Nadine crossed Central America and regenerated as Hurricane “Kristy” in the Pacific Ocean.', 'After Nadine we had Hurricane “Oscar” from October 19-22. It had peak winds of 85 mph and hit eastern Cuba. There were seven fatalities and significant flooding as the storm moved northeast and weakened, avoiding the U.S., but producing some heavy rainfall in the Bahamas.', 'The next two storm (if they develop) will be called “Patty”, then “Rafael”.', 'The orange hatched area in the Caribbean has (as I write this early Monday) a 40% chance of developing into a tropical storm.

After a curving typhoon, there is often a trend toward cooler weather (relative to average) in the eastern U.S. We’ll have to watch for that around Nov. 10-15.', 'A fairly weak tropical disturbance (“Trami”) will fade as it moves west into Viet Nam near Da Nang. It will likely produce some heavy rain and local flooring.', 'Once again, the tropical Indian Indian Ocean is quiet.', 'Here’s the latest ACE Index, a measure of the number and strength of tropical storms and hurricanes. The North Atlantic Sector has jumped up to a cumulative season ACE of 145.3. That compares to an average ACE-to-date of 113.7. So, that’s 128% of average ACE-to-date.', 'Of that 145.3 ACE, 35.1 of that came from long-lived hurricane Beryl. Hurricane Helene accumulated only 7.1 ACE Points because it was only a hurricane for two days.', 'Two other named storms, Alberto and Chris were much smaller and short-lived and then we had Debby, which was a Category 1 storm and Ernesto, that gave 84 mph winds to the island of Bermuda. Francine added a little to the Atlantic ACE as came ashore and hit Mississippi and Louisiana. Tropical Storm “Gordon” reached tropical storm status for 2 days in the mid-Atlantic. It did not affect land areas. We then had hurricane “Kirk” and hurricane “Leslie”, followed by “Milton”, “Nadine” and “Oscar”.', 'All other global sectors have well below ACE-to-date figures. It was the quietest start ever for the eastern Pacific. The ACE in the eastern Pacific sector is currently at just 81.5. Average-to-date ACE for this sector is 129.5. That’s just 63% of average ACE-to-date.', 'The Western Pacific Ocean Sector has an ACE-to-date of 126.1, compared to an average ACE-to-date of 249.7. This is just 50.5% of average ACE-to-date.', 'The North Indian Ocean has an ACE-to-date of 6.3, again well below the average ACE-to-date of 13.2.', 'If you take the entire globe, you get a current ACE-to-date of 360.5. That compares to an average ACE-to-date of 508.4 and that’s just 70.9% of average ACE-to-date.

They will prevent any potential tropical systems from moving toward the continental U.S. for the foreseeable future, perhaps for the rest of the hurricane season. Although, we can only confidently look ahead a couple of weeks.', 'In the Caribbean, however, conditions are still generally conducive for tropical development. Long-range computer forecasts show one or two low-pressure centers developing in or near the Caribbean in early November. The possible system intensities range from inconsequential to a hurricane.', 'Map of the Atlantic Ocean.', '(FOX Weather / FOX Weather)', 'The consensus for the possible track for a potential system is toward the northeastern Caribbean.', 'An upper-level disturbance in the form of a sharp jet-stream dip will be digging unusually far south about that time, which might be part of the triggering mechanism that could cause a disturbance or two to form. The dip in the jet stream also means that hostile upper winds will reach farther south, possibly tempering development.', 'In any case, there is nothing to look at for now. I expect we’ll see a potential development area from the National Hurricane Center soon, so we’ll wait to think much about it until then.', 'This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2024 FOX News Network, LLC.
