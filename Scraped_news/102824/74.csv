ACIP Recommends Pneumococcal Vaccine for Adults Aged 50 Years or Older,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/acip-recommends-pneumococcal-vaccine-adults-aged-50-years-or-2024a1000jh2,"['', '', 'Heidi Splete', 'October 24, 2024', ' ', 'The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) now recommends a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) for all PCV-naive adults aged 50 years or older. The new recommendation, which passed with an ACIP member vote of 14 for and 1 against, expands the current age-based recommendations, which include children younger than 5 years and adults older than 65 years, as well as adults aged 19-64 years with underlying conditions or risk factors who have not received a PCV and certain adults who have received PCV13 but not PCV20.', 'The recommendation would leave the choice of PCV up to the clinician. The updated language calls for a single dose of PCV (which could be PCV15, PCV20, or PCV21) for all adults aged 50 years or older; adults aged 19-64 years with underlying conditions (for whom PCV is already recommended) could receive the newly approved PCV21 as an option.', 'The decision was based in part on economic analyses of the use of PCV in adults aged 50-64 years in the United States. Miwako Kobayashi, MD, presented the summary of the Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group’s interpretation of the evidence and the proposed recommendation in a meeting of the ACIP on October 23, 2024, when the ACIP voting occurred.', 'Data from the CDC show an increase in the relative burden of pneumococcal disease in adults aged 50-64 years based in part on the success of the pediatric PCV program, she said.', 'Health equity was another main factor in the Work Group’s decision to recommend vaccination for adults aged 50 years or older. “Disparities in pneumococcal vaccine coverage by race and ethnicity exist for both age-based and risk-based indications,” Kobayashi noted in her presentation. The Work Group acknowledged that the overall effect of a vaccine recommendation on health equity is complex, but the majority agreed that the update would improve health equity by increasing vaccine coverage for those with known or unknown risk factors and providing protection at an earlier age when some populations already experience elevated disease rates, she said.', 'As for safety, the Work Group concluded that the undesirable anticipated effects of PCVs are minimal, despite the potential signal for Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and both the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue to monitor post-licensure safety of PCVs.', 'A majority of the ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group supported the approved option, but agreed that a future booster dose may be needed, said Work Group Chair James Loehr, MD, in his introductory presentation.', 'Overall, key uncertainties remain, including indirect effects of new pediatric pneumococcal vaccines on adults, data on the duration of protection with adult vaccinations, and the impact new higher-valency vaccines have on adults, several of which are in development, Loehr said.', 'A new 21-valent PCV, known as PCV 21, was approved by the FDA for adults aged 18 years or older in June 2024, said Loehr. “PCV21 is not PCV20 with one additional serotype” and provides additional protection, he emphasized. The Work Group examined models involving PCV21 and the existing PCV20. However, a majority of the Work Group agreed that having age-based recommendations based on vaccine product would be more challenging to implement and that insurance coverage may be a factor given the recent approval of PCV21. Therefore, the proposal submitted to the full ACIP was not for a specific PCV.', 'Notably, Loehr said that, although as Work Group Chair he was tasked with making the motion in favor of the recommendation, he voted against it as a voting member because of his strong opinion that only the PCV21 vaccine is needed for vaccine-naive adults aged 50 or older. “I think that PCV21 is a better vaccine that targets more serotypes,” he said during the discussion. Data presented at the February 2024 ACIP meeting showed more than 80% coverage vs less than 60% coverage for invasive pneumococcal disease with PCV21 vs PCV20 among adults aged 65 years or older and those aged 19-64 years with a risk-based indication, Loehr said.', 'Send comments and news tips to news@medscape.net.', 'Log in or register for free to unlock more Medscape content', 'Unlimited access to our entire network of sites and services', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The guidance is widely heeded by doctors and prompts health insurers to pay for recommended shots.', 'Pneumococcal shot recommendations are sometimes called the most complicated vaccination guidance that the government issues. The CDC currently recommends shots for children younger than 5 and adults 65 or older, as long as they have never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Officials also recommend the shots for children and adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as those with diabetes, chronic liver disease or a weakened immune system.', 'There are more than 100 known types of pneumococci bacteria, which can cause serious infections in the lungs and other parts of the body. Each year, the U.S. sees roughly 30,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, which includes blood infections, brain and spine inflammation, and other illnesses. About 30% of cases are among 50- to 64-year-olds.', 'The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1977, and since then pharmaceutical companies have been coming up with newer versions that target a dozen or more types in a single shot. Different vaccines have fallen in and out of favor, including Pfizer’s Prevnar 13, which was once a top-seller but is no longer available.', 'There are four vaccines now in use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year approved the newest — Merck’s Capvaxive, which can cost around $300 a dose and protects against 21 types, including eight not included in other pneumococcal vaccines. A Merck spokesperson said it was specifically designed to help protect against the bacteria types that cause the majority of severe disease in adults aged 50 and older.', ""The CDC advisory panel in June recommended the vaccine as an option for adults at higher risk. At the time, the committee also talked about the possibility of lowering the age recommendation for older adults. They noted that illness-causing infections peak at age 55 to 59 in Black Americans — a lower age than what’s seen in white people. But the committee put off that decision until this week's meeting."", 'Some concerns: A booster shot may prove to be necessary, perhaps in about 15 years. And there are some new vaccines in development that could force another update to the recommendations.', '“Pneumococcal has been a very confusing recommendation for many, many years and it’s hard to have a new recommendation every two or three years,” said Dr. Jamie Loehr, chair of the committee’s pneumococcal working group.

Infants, young children, and older adults are at the highest risk for pneumococcal infection, and viral illnesses, such as influenza, may predispose sensitive groups to pneumococcal infection.2 Pneumococci are common bacteria of the respiratory tract. There are over 100 known serotypes of S pneumoniae, and while most of these serotypes have the potential to cause disease in humans, the majority of pneumococcal disease is caused by a minority of the serotypes.1', 'Current vaccinations available for S pneumoniae are made of either pneumococcal polysaccharides, such as the PPSV23 vaccine, or pneumococcal conjugates, such as the pneumococcal conjugated vaccine-13 (PCV13) and the recently approved PCV15 and PCV20. Although PPSV23 covers more serotypes, the conjugated vaccine provides better immunogenicity than the polysaccharide version. Since the introduction of the earlier versions of the conjugated PCV7 (2000) and PCV13 (2010), racial disparities with pneumococcal infection have decreased and overall invasive pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes contained within the PCV13 vaccine have decreased. Furthermore, rates of penicillin-nonsusceptible and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates have decreased since the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. However, recent reports of invasive pneumococcal disease in Alaskan Native and Southwestern American Indian populations have reported incidences of disease caused by serotypes not covered in the PCV13 vaccine.2', 'From February to October 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) analyzed the pneumococcal disease epidemiology and immunology of PCV15 and PCV20 in the adult population. PCV15 included the serotypes covered in PCV13 plus serotypes 22F and 33F, and PCV20 included serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, and 15B in addition to the 15 serotypes in PCV15. This review found that PCV15 provided noninferior immunogenicity of the 13 shared serotypes compared with PCV13 and a significantly greater response to 3 serotypes, including serotype 3, which is shared between PCV13 and PCV15, as well as the PCV15-specific serotypes 22F and 33F. PCV20, when compared with PCV13, met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity for all 13 shared serotypes in adults aged 60 years and older. When compared with PPSV23, PCV20 had a higher percentage of seroresponders to 6 of 7 shared, non-PCV13 serotypes.3', 'In the phase 3 trial PNEU-PED (NCT03893448), conducted from 2019 to 2021, PCV15 showed noninferiority of immunogenicity to PCV13 in 12 of the 13 shared serotypes with superior immunogenicity to serotypes 3, 22F, and 33F in healthy infants. Adverse effects of PCV15 were comparable to those seen with PCV13.4 In June 2022, the FDA approved the use of PCV15 in pediatric patients aged 6 weeks and older.5,6 The phase 3 trial comparing PCV13 and PCV20 was conducted from 2020 to 2022 and demonstrated noninferior immunogenic responses to the 13 shared serotypes and a larger response to the 7 additional serotypes included in the PCV20 vaccination. Safety profiles of PCV20 were comparable to those of PCV13.7 PCV20 was subsequently approved in April 2023 (Table 1).6,9', 'Click to enlarge', 'In a 2023 surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease, including bacteremic pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia, in pediatric patients aged 5 years and younger, serotypes 19A, 3, 10A, and 12F were the most common cause of disease. Serotype 19A is covered in PCV13. Serotype 3 was identified as a common cause of invasive disease in countries with short-term and long-term utilization of PCV10 or PCV13 vaccinations. Several rationales are proposed, including a decline in vaccination rates and developing resistance.9 Serotypes 10A and 12F are novel to the PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines compared with the historically used products. Given that there are reports of these serotypes causing a significant number of cases of invasive disease, incorporation of these serotypes into vaccines and the preferential utilization of the newer vaccines has the potential to decrease rates of invasive pneumococcal disease even further. (Table 2)9,10', 'In summary, the PCV15 and PCV20 vaccinations provide a wider coverage of pneumococcal serotypes than the previously utilized conjugated pneumococcal vaccines. The expanded coverage of vaccinations includes 22F and 33F in PCV15 and 22F, 33F, 15B, 10A, 11A, 12F, and 8 in PCV20. A further decline in rates of invasive pneumococcal disease is anticipated in the near future. No studies directly compare PCV15 with PCV20 at this time.

These recommendations are not yet final and will still need final approval from the CDC director and the Department of Health and Human Services.', 'Still, the new guidelines could unlock a bigger patient pool for Merck and Pfizer. Currently, the CDC only recommends pneumococcal vaccination for older adults 65 years and above, as well as in young adults aged 19 through 65 with certain risk conditions.', 'A Merck spokesperson in an emailed statement welcomed the results of the ACIP vote, calling it a “potentially practice-changing decision” that could contribute to better immunization rates and health outcomes. The ACIP’s recommendations, if approved by the CDC director, “can help advance how we protect our communities from invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia,” the spokesperson said.', 'Merck’s Capvaxive, which the FDA approved in June 2024, is a 21-valent vaccine that targets the most prevalent serotypes, which cause around 84% of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 50 years and older. A few weeks after approval, the CDC’s ACIP unanimously endorsed the use of Capvaxive.', 'According to a Merck press release following the ACIP vote, the panel specifically recommends Capvaxive for adults aged 50 years and above who have not yet been immunized with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The shot can also be given to vaccine-naïve younger adults 19 to 49 years with “certain underlying medical conditions” and other risk factors.', 'The ACIP vote on Wednesday also presents a potential boon to Pfizer, which markets the 20-valent Prevnar 20. The FDA first approved the vaccine in June 2021 for adults 18 and above, and then in April 2023 to allow for pediatric use. Prevnar 20 improves upon Pfizer’s previous pneumococcal vaccine—Prevnar 13, which only covered 13 virus serotypes—and targets additional serotypes known to cause invasive pneumococcal disease or are associated with high fatality rates and antibiotic resistance.', 'As in the case of Capvaxive, the ACIP on Wednesday backed the use of Prevnar 20 in older adults 50 years and older, and in 19-to-49-year-olds with certain risk factors, according to a Pfizer press release.', '© 1985 - 2024 BioSpace.com.

The decision lowered — from 65 — the minimum recommended age for older adults to get the shot.', '“Now is a great time to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease in preparation for the winter respiratory season,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said in a statement Wednesday night.', 'The advisory committee voted 14-1 to make the change during a meeting earlier in the day in Atlanta. The guidance is widely heeded by doctors and prompts health insurers to pay for recommended shots.', 'Pneumococcal shot recommendations are sometimes called the most complicated vaccination guidance that the government issues. The CDC currently recommends shots for children younger than 5 and adults 65 or older, as long as they have never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Officials also recommend the shots for children and adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as those with diabetes, chronic liver disease or a weakened immune system.', 'There are more than 100 known types of pneumococci bacteria, which can cause serious infections in the lungs and other parts of the body. Each year, the U.S. sees roughly 30,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, which includes blood infections, brain and spine inflammation, and other illnesses. About 30% of cases are among 50- to 64-year-olds.', 'The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1977, and since then pharmaceutical companies have been coming up with newer versions that target a dozen or more types in a single shot. Different vaccines have fallen in and out of favor, including Pfizer’s Prevnar 13, which was once a top-seller but is no longer available.', 'There are four vaccines now in use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year approved the newest — Merck’s Capvaxive, which can cost around $300 a dose and protects against 21 types, including eight not included in other pneumococcal vaccines. A Merck spokesperson said it was specifically designed to help protect against the bacteria types that cause the majority of severe disease in adults aged 50 and older.', ""The CDC advisory panel in June recommended the vaccine as an option for adults at higher risk. At the time, the committee also talked about the possibility of lowering the age recommendation for older adults. They noted that illness-causing infections peak at age 55 to 59 in Black Americans — a lower age than what’s seen in white people. But the committee put off that decision until this week's meeting."", 'Some concerns: A booster shot may prove to be necessary, perhaps in about 15 years.
