All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland, who led the NFL with nine interceptions that included an NFL record five interception return touchdowns was also ruled out once again after not practicing all week.

Owner and general manager Jerry Jones allowed his roster to atrophy in the offseason while not making many substantial moves to replace the talent that exited. He has opted to solely rely on pre-existing young talent and rookies from the 2024 draft class like first-round pick Tyler Guyton and third-round pick Cooper Beebe up front while banking on third-year wide receiver Jalen Tolbert's development and 11-year veteran receiver Brandin Cooks staying healthy in addition to All-Pro CeeDee Lamb. In short, that school thought hasn't yielded the desired results as the entire offense has taken a step back from its blazing production in 2023.

Coach Mike McCarthy said Cook is ""ready"" to play after being kept on ice on the practice squad the first seven weeks of the season. He missed the entirety of training camp while working out in offseason home of Houston before he signed with Dallas on Aug. 29.

', 'Some of those things could involve scrambling more to juice both the passing game and the running game, a post-bye week change Prescott incorporated a season ago.

The 2022 NFL Defensive Player of the Year has already racked up 40 quarterback pressures this season, which rank as the second-most in the NFL behind Aidan Hutchinson's 45. Bosa went one-on-one with Steele on 16 of 17 matchups in the 49ers 42-10 beat down of Dallas in Week 5 last season, per NFL Pro Insights. However, he only recorded four pressures and half a sack that night. Perhaps Steele, now more than a year removed from a torn ACL, could do even better if Bosa takes a break from attempting to bully the rookie Guyton at left tackle. "", ""The primary defensive weakness Dallas has that 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan will likely look to exploit is their run defense since the Cowboys allow the fifth-most rushing yards per game (143.2) in the entire NFL. San Francisco running back Jordan Mason's 667 rushing yards are the second-most in the league behind only Derrick Henry's 873, but Mason leads the NFL in missed tackles forced with 53, per NFL Pro Insights. That's a significant problem for a Dallas defense that has the highest missed tackle rate (15.8%) in the entire league this season. Some of that figure can be attributed to the inexperience the Cowboys have at inside linebacker outside of 10-year veteran Eric Kendricks. Third-round rookie Marist Liufau, second-year linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and third-year linebacker Damone Clark have all taken a stab at filling the void left by Leighton Vander Esch's retirement. "", 'Should Dallas be able to slow down Mason on the ground, they might have a chance to handle 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, who produced the worst passer rating of his career in a start including playoffs, 36.7, after throwing three interceptions and no touchdowns as well as 212 yards on 17 of 31 passing in a Week 7 loss against the Chiefs. The big driver in his struggles was the lack of Samuel, Aiyuk and Jennings on the field. He threw more passes with Samuel, Aiyuk and Jennings all off the field in Week 7, 17, than he did in his first 37 career games combined, including the playoffs, per CBS Sports Research. However, Dallas is preparing for Samuel to play despite being less than 100%. ', '""You have to prepare for him. He\'s a dynamic player. He\'s dangerous because he\'s able to be productive from so many different spots on the field. That\'s our approach. We\'re preparing for him to play. I think he should rest, based on what I\'m told,"" McCarthy said Thursday with a chuckle. ""We\'re preparing for him.""  ', ""The Cowboys might be able to hang around early, but their banged-up defensive front likely won't be able to hang with Mason and the 49ers run game for four quarters. I'm betting San Francisco wins the time of possession battle as well as the football game, and they do so by multiple scores, running their winning streak against the Cowboys to four in a row.

The club may have had an even record, but their 42 point differential entering Week 8 was the third-worst in the NFL. They seemed competitive for a half, with Mike McCarthy’s troops taking a four-point lead into the half. At one point they held a seven-point lead, their first time leading by more than three points in 30 days.', 'But the 10-6 halftime advantage saw them allow the San Francisco 49ers 21 straight points in the third quarter. In the blink of an eye, Dallas was being blown out yet again. And like their game against Baltimore, they tried to rally in the fourth quarter only to fall short in a game that wasn’t as close at it appeared.', 'The 49ers held on for a 30-24 victory in a loss that dropped Dallas to 3-4 on the season. San Francisco improved to 4-4 on the year.', 'Quarterback Dak Prescott threw two interceptions, upping his total to eight through seven games. There was not much rhythm at all until the two fourth-quarter drives that featured CeeDee Lamb scoring two touchdowns on 13 reeptions for 146 yards.', 'There is plenty of blame to go around.', '2) Jerry Jones’ roster just isn’t good enough to be viewed as a serious contender', 'The Cowboys might not have a Super Bowl win in decades, but they do, at the very least, remain competitive just about every year. They have a streak of three straight 12-win seasons as of this writing, and have been one of the best teams in the NFC in that stretch.', 'Expectations for this Cowboys team ahead of the 2024 campaign was, as it always is, to win the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, owner and general manager Jerry Jones did very little this offseason to prove that he’s serious about winning right now, and the results are showing.', 'The Cowboys’ defense is a mess. Their running back room is a mess. With Brandin Cooks out, they don’t have a real WR2 to take any sort of pressure off of CeeDee Lamb. Mike McCarthy has proven time and time again that he isn’t good enough as the head coach.', 'A few players showed some fight late in the game.', 'DeMarvion Overshown, LB', 'Overshown scratched and clawed until his fingernails were probably chipped and filled with blood. He’d lead the team in tackles alongside Oruwariye, and delivered in an even bigger capacity when the exhausted defense needed him most. Late in the fourth quarter, with the Cowboys having fought back to a mere 30-24 deficit with less than five minutes remaining in the game, Overshown teleported off of the edge to take Purdy down for a sack that forced an eventual punt. The Cowboys’ offense couldn’t capitalize with a comeback win, but Overshown did give them an opportunity.', 'The season continues to spiral downhill, and Dak is not blameless.', 'Cowboys fans at large have defended Prescott against unjust criticisms. However, three consecutive games with multiple interceptions is unacceptable.', 'Prescott’s second interception looked like an INT the whole way. It was a forced throw to CeeDee Lamb on 3rd-and-4 and Deommodore Lenoir read it the whole way. The Cowboys only trailed 13-10 at the time. A punt in that situation would have been totally fine.', 'The ball begged to be thrown away, but Prescott tried to make something out of nothing. That is exactly what he did on his first quarter interception when he overshot KaVontae Turpin with Nick Bosa closing in for a sack.', 'It is clear that Prescott is trying to make plays for a stagnant offense, but for an average team decimated with injuries sometimes less is more.', 'Don’t be tricked by the final score, either. No team is better at making a lopsided loss appear close than the Cowboys. While there is something to be said that Prescott and Lamb connected for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to make the 49ers sweat some, Prescott’s play was nowhere near good enough before San Francisco softened up its defense.', 'It wasn’t the greatest end to the weekend for Cowboys fans.', 'Unfortunately, the game flipped on its head in the third quarter, with the Cowboys being out-scored 21-0. The 49ers started with the ball in the second half, and easily drove down the field to take a 13-10 lead. Following the touchdown, QB Dak Prescott gave the ball right back to the 49ers offense, after throwing an interception.', 'The 49ers then scored again, to take a 20-10 lead. Needing a big response on offense, Dallas answered with a typical three-and-out and punted the ball back to the 49ers who proceeded to score again, expanding their lead to 27-10.', 'The Cowboys made it interesting in the fourth quarter, bringing it to a one-possession game and having a chance to take the lead late in the game. Having the ball on offense down six points with just three minutes remaining in the game, the offense couldn’t even gain a yard in four plays. Ultimately, their fourth-quarter comeback attempt came up just short and the team dropped their second consecutive game, losing 30-24. The team will look to turn things around next week against a high-powered Falcons offense in Atlanta.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537).

It should be another busy day for Dak Prescott and the passing game. "", 'Here are my NFL picks for this Sunday Night Football showdown on Sunday, October 27.', ""Who will win Cowboys vs 49ers?\nDon't overthink this. Yes, the injuries are piling up, but there is still a lot of talent on this offense, and Dallas has zero running game, making this offense very predictable. The 49ers roll and the noise in Jerry World gets even louder following the bye. I like the 49ers at -3.5 as that number could lengthen if SF gets healthier and Dallas' defense doesn't return any bodies. "", 'My best bet\nDak Prescott 35+ pass attempts (-115 at bet365)', 'My analysis\nDak Prescott threw just 33 passes in his last game but was pulled late and could have racked up the pass attempts in garbage time. The week before that, he threw the ball 42 times in the outdoor setting of Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.', ""On the season, he's averaging 37 pass attempts per game but also 0.61 passes per snap which is a 61% pass rate. Only Seattle is passing the ball more than Dallas, as the Cowboys' running game is broken and beyond repair."", 'Rico Dowdle has more than 46 yards rushing once this year and ranks 31st at his position in yards per rush. This is still a pass-first offense that is giving Ezekiel Elliott five to eight carries a game at 3.0 yards per tote. Dallas is not running the ball Sunday, and expect another heavy passing game from Prescott, who has had to sit through a bye week after getting benched late in Week 6. ', 'THE BLITZ is projecting nearly 37 attempts from the Dallas QB, who has seen this market close at 36.5 or higher in half of his games. It was 37.5 vs. the Lions in Week 6 and was well on its way to going Over until he was benched. ', 'There are a ton of injuries on the 49ers, but one thing that is certain in this game is that the Cowboys can’t run, and Prescott and his team’s pass-first mentality are going to rack up the pass attempts Sunday night.

The WR hasn’t hit 100 yards this year, yet, but is averaging 78 yards on 25% share of each route. His air-yard share is down 10 points to 26.5% this year so there is a lot of room for more production and hopefully the bye fixed those issues.

As Dallas entered San Francisco territory, Prescott took the deep shot to the left side of the field that was intercepted by Brown inside the 10 yard line. The takeaway was very much a team effort with defensive lineman Nick Bosa getting the quarterback hit on Prescott as he was releasing his pass. This allowed the 49ers starting safety to jump the route and get the ball back in hands of Brock Purdy and the 49ers offense."", ""Interception No. 2 was secured by defensive back Deommodore Lenoir following San Francisco's go-ahead third quarter touchdown. Prescott rolled to his left and targeted wide receiver CeeDee Lamb near the sideline, however, Lenoir made a tremendous play on the ball and stayed inbounds to snag the pick. That interception marks back-to-back games for Lenoir with a pick, and, following his splash play, the 49ers offense was able to take over on Dallas 32 yard line."", 'Dimes to Deebo Samuel Sr.', 'The deep ball connection between Purdy and wide receiver Deebo Samuel Sr., who was hospitalized earlier in the week with pneumonia, is alive and well. San Francisco found themselves in a third-and-six situation on their opening drive when Purdy dropped a dime downfield to his ""wideback"" for an impressive 47-yard completion. San Francisco went on to cap off their seven-play, 55-yard drive with a 50-yard field goal by kicker Anders Carlson.', 'Injuries of the Game', 'Running back Jordan Mason went down on his fourth carry of the game and was examined on the field following the six-yard rush. The third-year running back was able to run off the field on his own but only had two more carries before being ruled as questionable to return with a shoulder injury in the second quarter. He did not return to action for the remainder of the game.', 'Midway through the third quarter, linebacker Dee Winters was evaluated for a head injury, and he was later downgraded to out with a concussion. Samuel Sr. exited the game with injured ribs and did not reenter the game. Cornerback Renardo Green exited the game with an ankle injury.', 'Celebrating National Tight Ends Day', ""For the second week in a row, tight end George Kittle closed out the night as the team's receiving yards leader. On the NFL holiday he helped create, Kittle racked up six catches for 128 yards and a touchdown, which gives him 6,777 career receiving yards, and he eclipsed the 500-career receptions mark. The veteran tight end's 6,777 career receiving yards are good for the third-most receiving yards in franchise history. Kittle overtook two-time Super Bowl winning receiver Dwight Clark for that No. 3 spot on the leaderboard."", 'Kittle\'s longest reception of the day came on the 49ers opening drive of the third quarter. Purdy hit Kittle over the middle and ""The People\'s Tight End"" nearly punched in the score before being brought down on Dallas\' four yard line. On the next play, rookie Isaac Guerendo took the handoff and barreled into the end zone for his first-career touchdown. Guerendo\'s four-yard rushing touchdown gave the 49ers the 13-10 advantage.', 'On the next offensive series, Kittle would not be denied the touchdown. He went untouched into pay dirt and hauled in a two-yard pass from Purdy to extend the lead to 20-10. Holding calls were initially thrown on the play but taken back after review.', 'Purdy Special', 'The 49ers QB1 put up huge numbers against Dallas through the air and on the ground. Purdy completed 18-of-26 pass attempts for 260 yards, a touchdown and 114.3 passer rating. He also made a ton of plays with his legs, closing out the game as the 49ers second leading rusher with eight carries for 56 yards and a two-yard touchdown.

NFL Week 8 Takeaways: 49ers bounce back to keep pace in wild NFC West,https://www.sportsnet.ca/nfl/article/nfl-week-8-takeaways-49ers-bounce-back-to-keep-pace-in-wild-nfc-west/,"['This is a modal window.', '', '', '', 'Brock Purdy went 18/26 for 260 yards and touchdown in the air and added on on the ground, while George Kittle had a score to go along with 128 receiving yards to lead the San Francisco 49ers past the Dallas Cowboys 30-24.', 'Hey, did you hear? Sunday was National Tight Ends Day. ', '(Yes, you heard.)', '', 'For a totally made-up occasion, tight ends around the NFL sure stepped up to celebrate. Kyle Pitts scored a pair of touchdowns to help the Falcons down the Buccaneers, the Lions’ trouncing of the Titans featured two tight end scores, Travis Kelce finally looked like his old self to help the Chiefs stay perfect in a win over the Raiders, and George Kittle provided the cherry on top with his performance against Dallas on the Sunday Night stage. Kittle caught six passes for 128 yards and a touchdown to help get the 49ers back on track with a crucial 30-24 win over the Cowboys to get back to .500 on the season.', 'Whenever Dallas and San Francisco meet on the gridiron, talk of this storied rivalry resurfaces — tales of playoff showdowns and Super Bowl dominance of decades past. But with both clubs stumbling through the first half of the 2024 season and dealing with more than a few injuries, Sunday night’s meeting felt more like a measuring stick for each team’s future than an opportunity to reminisce about the past. ', 'Both the Cowboys and 49ers entered Sunday with just three wins on the season and plenty of question marks. The strength of the 2023 Cowboys — defence, and plenty of it — has been a major weakness of the 2024 squad, while the 49ers’ deep arsenal of weapons we saw on the field last year has been banged up early and often this season. Both teams have been forced to fix things on the fly, to varying levels of success. ', 'The 49ers’ offence, which is still without star running back Christian McCaffrey and staring down a season without Brandon Aiyuk, took another hit Sunday when backup RB Jordan Mason left the game with what’s being called a shoulder injury. In typical 49ers next-man-up fashion, backup-to-the-backup Isaac Guerendo stepped up with 14 carries for 85 yards and a touchdown. ', 'So, what comes next for both sides? The 49ers enter a 4-4 gridlock in the NFC West sandwiched between the Cardinals and Seahawks with matching records while the Rams (3-4) are just one win shy of joining them. That division might not be the best in football, but it is the most interesting. A well-timed Week 9 bye should allow them a little time to get healthy. ', 'As for the Cowboys, the uphill climb is steep. They now sit three wins behind the Commanders (6-2) and two behind the Eagles (5-2). They play both squads in the next four weeks. ', 'TUA’S BACK, BUT IS IT TOO LATE FOR DOLPHINS?', 'All eyes were on Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa earlier Sunday as he made his return to action for the first time since suffering a concussion in Week 2. And while there were several victories to be had by the Dolphins in this one — a successful game-opening scoring drive, a season-high point total, a textbook QB slide that had fans on their feet and chanting their QB’s name, and, above all, a healthy Tagovailoa from start to finish. ', 'But it didn’t add up to a crucial Week 8 win over the Arizona Cardinals, thanks to a late drive by Kyler Murray to set up kicker Chad Ryland for a walk-off field goal to take the 28-27 W.', 'While the Cardinals now sit at .500 atop what is a surprisingly winnable NFC West following the Seahawks’ late-window loss to the Buffalo Bills, the Dolphins remain in troubled waters. Their 2-4 record heading into their Week 7 bye was always going to be a major hurdle in the hunt for a wild card berth. A 2-5 record nearing mid-season is a whole lot tougher. A loss to the 6-2 Bills next week might just dash all hope of a run. ', 'Now, about that AFC East… ', 'JETS’ SEASON GETS MESSIER WITH LOSS TO PATRIOTS', 'Both the New York Jets and the New England Patriots entered Week 8 riding the kind of streak nobody wants to keep. The 1-6 Patriots hadn’t won since their season-opening stunner over the Bengals, stringing all six of their losses into one sad chain resulting in their own coach calling them soft after loss No. 6, while the Jets entered Sunday having lost all four of their games since their last meeting with New England, their season getting messier by the minute. ', 'Just when we thought things couldn’t get worse for the Jets, Gang Green went and lost to a one-win divisional rival whose success this year isn’t really measured on the scoreboard. ', 'Just like the Jets’ season, New York’s 25-22 loss was a series of self-inflicted wounds. Kicker Greg Zuerlein missed an extra point on the Jets’ first touchdown, and later missed a field goal in what was ultimately a three-point loss. New York’s defence allowed a struggling offence, which averaged just 3.9 yards per play and lost rookie starter Drake Maye mid-game, to keep pace — and ultimately take over in the final minutes. ', 'The Jets’ 2-6 record now matches that of the Patriots. Firing Robert Saleh wasn’t the answer. Neither was bringing in Davante Adams. A season that started with Super Bowl expectations now looks like the beginning of another rebuild — just like their Sunday opponent. ', 'If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em… right?', 'CHIEFS STAY PERFECT. HOW FAR CAN THEY GO?', 'The Kansas City Chiefs haven’t found themselves on the losing side of a football game since Christmas Day of last year. ', 'The team that delivered that loss? The Las Vegas Raiders, who hosted the league’s last remaining undefeated team on Sunday hoping to stump their division rival again. The Raiders couldn’t repeat that Christmas success, though, falling short in every major offensive category and failing to stop Patrick Mahomes & Co. — a unit that now includes DeAndre Hopkins, whose Chiefs debut saw him catch two passes for 29 yards.', 'The win within the win for Kansas City is the man atop the Chiefs’ receiving leaderboard in the 27-20 victory: tight end Travis Kelce, who after a relatively quiet first six games led the team in catches (10) and yards (90) and scored his first touchdown of the season. ', 'There’s still more than half a season to go, but we’re at the point where we can start to wonder… how long, exactly, can this Chiefs win streak go? The 7-0 squad faces the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next Monday, followed by another divisional clash against Denver in Week 10. Circle Week 11 on the schedule, which sees Mahomes take on Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills in what should be a classic.', 'BROWNS STUN RAVENS. NOW WHAT?', 'Following seven weeks of déjà vu on offence for the Cleveland Browns, Week 8 brought a change of pace. With Watson officially out for the season with a torn Achilles, the starting job now belongs to Jameis Winston — and the backup made good on his first start since September 2022. After seven weeks of sub-20 point tallies and just one win all season with Watson at the helm, the Browns’ offence came to life Sunday against Baltimore — for one day, anyway. ', 'Cleveland stunned the Ravens 29-24, Winston & Co. stealing the victory with a last-minute toss to receiver Cedric Tillman. Winston completed 27 of 41 passes for 334 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions to stun Baltimore and do Pittsburgh a solid in the process — the Steelers, who face the New York Giants Monday night, can now take a one-game lead atop the division with a victory.', 'Winston’s first start feels a little bit familiar, too. When Watson went down last year, the club called Joe Flacco, who guided the roster into the post-season. And we all know the Winston experience typically ends on the bench, thanks to his big-risk style of play. ', 'Now 2-6, the Browns are still in the basement of the AFC North. They’ve already sold their top wide receiver, Amari Cooper, to the Buffalo Bills, and are closer to going back to a rebuild this year than they are to reviving their contender status. Watson wasn’t the long-term answer, and Winston likely isn’t, either, but if he can take advantage of this chance to start he could at least make things interesting. ', 'DANIELS SAVES HIS BEST PLAY FOR LAST', 'It was a showdown that almost didn’t happen. When Jayden Daniels left last Sunday’s matchup against the Panthers with a rib injury, it looked like the Week 8 contest between the first and second overall picks of the class of 2024 would be in jeopardy. ', 'Even with Daniels cleared to start against fellow rookie Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears, this game wasn’t looking like the showdown we’d all been hoping for. Both rookies have blossomed this season, but Sunday’s game was a slow burn of field goals. ', 'That is, until the very last play, when Daniels took a three-point deficit with zeros on the clock and turned it into one of the wildest Hail Mary walk-off wins we’ve ever seen. Daniels dipped and dodged Bears defenders for almost 13 seconds before unleashing a bomb into the end zone, which was tipped into the hands of Noah Brown for the game-winning score by Bears defender Tyrique Stevenson. Stevenson’s misplay was even worse when a fan’s video revealed he was busy taunting Commanders fans during the play before joining the fray.', '', 'Stevenson posted a statement post-game on social media, promising to learn from the situation.', '', '45 Comments', '458 Comments', '6 Comments', '22 Comments', '28 Comments', 'With your consent we may collect cookies and information to enhance our service, and improve your experience.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Kyle Shanahan might be further incentivized to run the ball without Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings and possibly Deebo Samuel."", ""Mason can be relied on to shoulder the load.

Additionally, even after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 6, Mason handled 14 of San Francisco's backfield's 16 rush attempts in Week 7."", 'Mason has an excellent matchup this week.

Entering the half up 10-6, it would be hard for Dallas fans to be disappointed with the defense’s performance.', 'Unfortunately, they received very little help from their offense until late, specifically their quarterback. Dak Prescott threw two interceptions in the loss on Sunday night. It was his third-straight game with multiple interceptions, becoming the first Cowboys QB to do that since Troy Aikman in 1992.', 'His first interception came on a poor decision in the first quarter, when Prescott forced a pass into double coverage to WR KaVontae Turpin.', 'Prescott went ahead and threw the ball even though he had pressure up the middle and couldn’t step into the pass. The double coverage and the pressure should have made him think twice about that risky pass.', 'Prescott added to his interception total in the third quarter, trying to turn something out of nothing by forcing a pass to a contested CeeDee Lamb near the sideline.', 'The ninth-year QB was able to get some rhythm in the fourth quarter, connecting with WR CeeDee Lamb on two touchdowns where the 49ers just blew the coverage, and brought the Cowboys within one possession. However, with the team needing a game-winning drive with roughly three minutes left in the game, Prescott had four straight incompletions.', 'Prescott finished the game with a lackluster statline consisting of 242 passing yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. It continues his trend of playing poorly against their NFC rival, as he has now lost four straight games against the Niners.', 'In two playoff games against San Francisco, Prescott has an 0-2 record and was a large part of the losses. He only threw for two touchdowns and three interceptions in those two defeats, with a 66.7 passer rating. Last season, the team lost by an embarrassing score of 42-10. Prescott had his worst game last season against the Niners, throwing three interceptions to only one touchdown.', 'The Cowboys’ quarterback is having a rough season. It can be argued that the front office didn’t make it easy for him with their lack of acquiring talent this offseason. The offensive line is having its issues and the wide receiver corps outside of Lamb is depleted. However, when you’re the highest-paid player in NFL history, you’re expected to overcome adversity and be one of the reasons your team wins.

In the same period, San Francisco has won 35 games in the regular season and made the NFC championship game every year — including an appearance in the Super Bowl last season.', 'Last year, the 49ers were the top seed in the NFC, while the Cowboys finished second. The ultimate success, a championship, hasn’t been there, but the consistency from both teams has been an accomplishment in its own right.', 'Until now.', 'Entering their Week 8 showdown on “Sunday Night Football,” Dallas and San Francisco have been two of the more disappointing teams in the NFL.

As a result, their scoring defense has dropped precipitously from fifth to 31st.', 'Offensively, Dallas’ slide is more confounding, because the cast of characters is largely the same. But the Cowboys have gone from having the NFL’s top scoring offense a year ago to its 20th this season, averaging nearly nine points per game less.', 'Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones tried to offer an explanation for the offensive drop-off this week, basically blaming his head coach.', '“We’re designing bad plays, or we’re designing bad concepts,” Jones said Tuesday on his weekly radio appearance on the team’s network. “The facts are that there’s some of that, but there’s also some execution [issues]. There’s some of the talent. I like our talent; I really do like our talent. I like our young talent, but young talent has a few more mistakes associated with it than if you’re dealing with a veteran player.”', '(Jones, it should be noted, opted against signing veteran running back Derrick Henry in the offseason even though he lives in Dallas and said publicly he would have been interested in playing for the Cowboys. Henry leads the NFL in rushing yards, while Dallas has the worst rushing attack in the league.)', 'It’s still early enough in the season for either team to rebound and make the postseason.

Cowboys fall to 3-4 after another ugly loss at the hands of the San Francisco 49ers,https://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article294621539.html,"['', 'If the bye week allowed for a rejuvenation period for the Dallas Cowboys, it wasn’t necessarily shown at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday night — especially in the third quarter — as they suffered their fourth straight loss to the San Francisco 49ers, 30-24.', 'Without stars such as Micah Parsons and DaRon Bland for yet another week, the defense slowed down in the second half and saw George Kittle and the 49ers offense explode in the second half.', 'While a late valiant comeback attempt was put forth behind Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb finding their connection, it came up short in the final minutes.', 'Here are the takeaways from the loss that bumps the Cowboys back below .500 at 3-4 on the season.', 'Last season, we saw the offense find its rhythm after the bye week as Prescott put together an 11-game stretch that made him an MVP runner-up and CeeDee Lamb etched the best season for a receiver in franchise history.', 'Well, the hope for the same post-bye magic happening in San Francisco slowly evaporated with continued staleness in the running game and forced action downfield in the passing game that led to two untimely interceptions from Prescott.', '“We got to get started,” Lamb said. “We have to maintain the momentum. We’re too up-and-down offensively, I think everybody can say that. We have to go put up points, rather it’s three or seven, every time we touch the field.”', 'In the second half specifically, the Cowboys consistently faced multiple second- and third-and-longs that kept them from starting or sustaining offensive drives. Basic route concepts led to simplistic answers in coverage from the 49ers and a lack of success in getting points on the scoreboard for Dallas.', 'If there’s any confidence to take away, seeing Prescott connect with Lamb for 13 receptions for 146 yards and two touchdowns was what the doctor ordered for getting their rhythm back in motion. But when there is absolutely no offense around them, what does it matter?', 'Mike McCarthy has preached the need for solid defense paving the way for solid offense, and vice-versa, throughout the season. The minus-six turnover margin coming in was highlighted throughout the week after McCarthy pointed to that being the biggest reason for the inability to find success on the scoreboard in 2024.', 'After a game that saw that season turnover margin decrease by two more notches to eighton Sunday night, those concerns are now at a deafening screech. Even with opportunities such as a Brock Purdy fumble and a dropped interception from Chauncey Golston, the Cowboys can’t find any extra possessions via takeaways this season. For an offense that needs a jolt at times to get going, the defense is only setting them further back with their inability to create opportunities.', '“I can’t turn the ball over, period,” Prescott said. “I don’t have to be perfect, but I damn sure can’t be having the turnovers...We put ourselves behind in the turnover battle, and that’s on me. I’ve got to clean that up, period.”', 'As long as the overwhelming turnover trend continues, the Cowboys will continue to get run out of games.', 'Whether it was George Kittle or Deebo Samuel, the 49ers receiving weapons found open green grass across the middle of the field on multiple occasions on Sunday night, much like the rest of the Cowboys opponents this season.', 'The lack of a Cowboys pass rush (they did have two late sacks) allowed for routes to develop across the middle of the field where the Cowboys safeties have been inept in holding down their coverage responsibilities.', '“It’s one of the things for the defense that is tough,” DeMarvion Overshown said postgame. “It’s tough on our safeties and it’s tough on our linebackers to get underneath and help it. It’s one thing we need to continue to work on. The crossers, they’ve been eating us up for the past six games. It got us this game too.”', 'Holes are being exposed, and there isn’t a bigger hole in the pass defense than right between the hashes where Purdy found the big play to open the game up in the second half and rode it to a victory.', 'The expectation was that Parsons and Bland would be able to make it back after the bye week, but it didn’t happen Sunday night. Going into Atlanta next week, it’s time for those guys to get back in the mix.', 'The Cowboys need a sign of life in the pass rush and they need to find ways to create turnovers. Who better to put on the field than a perennial NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate and the league-leader in interceptions from 2023?', 'Bland will have to be activated onto the roster by Wednesday unless the Cowboys want to sit him for the rest of the season, so his status should have a bright outlook going into the week. On the other hand, Parsons will continue to have a questionable status going into week nine.', 'If it wasn’t clear before, it certainly is now: This team is not built to succeed against the best the NFC has to offer. And if Jerry Jones wants a roster that can compete in January, moves and decisions will have to be made — sooner than later.', 'Or, Jones can be content with seeing his young core gain valuable experience in a season that will, at best, see the Cowboys fall at or below the line of mediocrity.', 'But what can realistically be added? The Cowboys need a receiver, a running back, a run stopper and a pass rusher. They need consistency, toughness and identity on both sides of the ball. If somehow the opportunity presents itself for Jones to find those players before the deadline, why wait? Unless he is content with riding the season out in mediocrity.', 'This story was originally published October 27, 2024, 11:00 PM.', '', 'Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.', 'Part of the McClatchy Media Network']"
