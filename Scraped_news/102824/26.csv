Let's take a closer look at the company's earnings, CEO Elon Musk's comments, and whether now is a good time to buy the stock."", 'After a decline in the first two quarters of the year, deliveries increased by 6% in Q3. Model 3/Y deliveries rose by 5% to 43,668 vehicles, while other models, including the Cybertruck, saw deliveries spike 43% to 22,915 vehicles.', 'Total vehicle production in the quarter, meanwhile, climbed 9% to 469,796.

However, despite delivering 6% more vehicles, it only saw a 1% increase in automotive revenue outside of the regulatory credits, which is still pretty lackluster growth coming from its principal business. Meanwhile, the high-margin regulatory credits are generally something that shouldn't be relied upon."", 'The 20% to 30% delivery growth prediction, meanwhile, looks aggressive. Electric vehicle growth has slowed, and Tesla is facing increased competition in this market from established players and new upstarts. Meanwhile, in China, the largest EV market in the world, there has been an ongoing price war. And while Tesla has talked about a more affordable model next year, there are no details about what this could look like. On the earnings call, Musk said that a $25,000 regular model would be ""silly"" and ""pointless.""', ""While Tesla played up autonomous driving and how many autonomous vehicles it is producing, the simple fact is that the company does not sell or produce vehicles that don't need humans alert and ready at the wheel. At the same time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the company's full self-driving system over continued accidents, while its camera-only technology continues to be called into question.

While automotive revenues remained relatively flat with a 2% year-on-year increase, energy generation and storage revenue jumped 52% from Q3 2023.', 'Tesla reported just under US$2.4 billion in revenue from its energy business for the quarter, versus just under US$1.6 billion in the same quarter of last year, while Q3 automotive revenue was at US$20 billion compared to US$19.6 billion in Q3 2023.   ', 'The company shipped 6.9GWh of battery storage, including its Megapack utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) and Powerwall residential units in the quarter. This was about 30% less than the all-time-high 9.4GWh it reported for the second quarter of this year but a 75% increase year-on-year from Q3 2023’s 4GWh.', 'Similarly, generation and storage revenues were about 23.7% lower than in Q2 when Tesla reported just over US$3 billion.', 'While the energy segment includes solar PV installations, the contribution of the solar business has been declining since Tesla entered the sector in 2016 with the acquisition of SolarCity and the subsequent firing of Musk’s cousins who ran the business.', 'Solar figures were not included in Tesla’s Q3 shareholder deck or in the company’s earnings call to explain results, nor was the performance of its solar business mentioned.', 'Musk, setting aside his activities endorsing Donald Trump’s presidency and paying Republicans to register for voting, said on the earnings call that “the energy storage business is growing like wildfire, with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.”', '“For the energy business, that’s doing extremely well … the opportunity ahead is gigantic,” the CEO said.', 'In the Q2 results call in July, Tesla executives said the company’s Megapack factory in Lathrop, California, was on track to ramp up to 40GWh annual production capacity by the end of this year.', 'Musk said that has already been achieved, with the factory now producing 200 Megapacks per week, while its Megapack factory under construction in Shanghai, China, will be up and running from Q1 2025 with 20GWh annual production capacity.', 'The Shanghai factory will also ramp up, Musk said, before making the 100GWh per year claim and adding that this will “ultimately grow I think to multiple terawatt-hours per year.”', '“It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future. If you’re not at the terawatt scale, you’re not really moving the needle.”', 'The Trumpist CEO then talked about the vital importance of solar as the primary energy source for that sustainable energy future. However, at this stage, it appears that Tesla is happy to let others deliver that part of the clean energy equation. It remains to be seen how this belief in sustainable energy squares with his preferred presidential candidate’s agenda.  ', 'Regarding the dip in storage shipments and energy segment revenues versus Q2, CFO Vaibhav Taneja noted—as have executives at other major BESS manufacturers and integrators—that demand can be seasonal and fluctuate. Despite that dip, Tesla expects Q4 numbers to be much higher, Taneja said.', 'The company expects energy storage shipments for the full year to be more than double the 14.7GWh reported for 2023. For the first nine months of the year, it has already deployed a cumulative 20.4GWh.', 'In previous earnings calls, Musk had commented that energy is the company’s highest-margin business segment, and in Q3, the 30.5% gross margin was a company record. Its overall GAAP gross margin including automotive and services revenues was 19.8% in Q3.   ', 'Despite Musk’s proclamations and Taneja’s upbeat assessment, renewables and storage were sidelined, beyond Musk’s opening remarks.

The overall top 15 suppliers, as selected by PV Tech Research analysis, was unsurprisingly dominated by China.', 'The bankability report assesses companies on metrics including cell manufacturing and module assembly capacity, ESS solutions shipment volumes, and financial health based on Altman Z scores.', '“While Tesla relies upon some third-party battery cell supply, the quarterly deployment levels of ESS solutions are currently trending at record highs (almost 10 GWh). Furthermore, Tesla’s financial scores are at the upper end of all the companies analysed in the first report, although ESS operations still represent a minor part of the total group turnover,” wrote Charlotte Gisbourne, PV Tech Research analyst, in a guest blog about the report’s launch for this site.', 'Tesla also topped Wood Mackenzie’s leaderboard rankings for global energy storage system integrators in 2023.

Investors question Elon Musk’s politicking as Tesla stock takes big jump,https://www.deseret.com/business/2024/10/25/elon-musk-tesla-stock-price-jumps-investor-concerns-donald-trump-campaign/,"['Tesla stock saw its biggest price jump since 2013 on Thursday with shares in the Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle company moving up 22% following a better-than-expected earnings report.', 'The stock rise pushed Musk’s on-paper personal wealth up $26 billion, further cementing his status as the world’s richest individual. Musk’s real-time net worth as of midday Friday was just over $272 billion, according to tracking by Forbes. While most of his personal wealth comes from the nearly 13% of Tesla stock under his control, the tech entrepreneur owns over 40% of SpaceX, the space vehicle development company he founded in 2002 that’s currently worth around $200 billion, as well as controlling interests in social media platform X, formerly Twitter, and artificial intelligence firm, xAI.', 'Late Wednesday, Tesla reported third quarter earnings of 72 cents per share, outpacing analysts’ average estimates of 58 cents. Tesla’s overall revenues grew 8% in the quarter to $25.18 billion from $23.35 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion from $1.85 billion a year ago. The positive financial report, along with Musk’s comments about his expectation for a vibrant future for the company’s plans for developing fully autonomous vehicles, helped drive the stock upswing.', 'Tesla’s stock rebound follows an 18% dip earlier this month that was fueled by disappointing third-quarter vehicle delivery data as well as an unveiling of the new Tesla CyberCab vehicle that left market watchers and investors underwhelmed.', 'In spite of Thursday’s value jump, some investors expressed concerns over Musk’s public activities in support of former President Donald Trump’s quest for a return to the Oval Office and potential impacts on Tesla’s value moving forward. Musk endorsed Trump shortly after the July assassination attempt, has donated tens of millions of dollars to political action groups supporting the former president and even appeared with the GOP candidate at campaign events.', 'On a forum Tesla uses to solicit investor questions ahead of earnings calls, dozens of inquiries poured in from retail shareholders about Musk’s political activities, his incendiary commentary on X and his efforts to get Trump back in the White House, according to a report from CNBC.', '“Elon Musk has the right to express his political views, but his public activism seems at odds with his responsibility as CEO to protect shareholder value,” an anonymous retail investor wrote on the forum, per CNBC. “How does Tesla address this, and can it confirm Musk’s actions are not harming sales or growth?”', 'Another investor asked if Tesla’s board is doing anything to ensure Musk’s “political engagement doesn’t detract from Tesla’s core mission and protects shareholder value and brand integrity.”', 'Earlier this month, Musk unveiled a new two-door electric vehicle dubbed Cybercab that is designed for fully autonomous operation, a feature most notable in the car’s lack of steering wheel or pedals.', 'Those attending the private event also got a peek at a Tesla Robovan, another new model aiming for full autonomous driving and capable of carrying 20 passengers. Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus, also made an appearance at the gathering, with a number of the android units mixing and serving drinks to guests, according to reports.', 'While the Cybercab and Robovan reveal featured the first new Tesla models since the Cybertruck came out in 2019, an event long on pomp and short on details, along with Musk’s history of coming up short on promised innovation goals, soured investors in spite of his upbeat commentary. Tesla share prices dropped 8% on the day after the unveilings.', 'Musk has repeatedly missed deadlines he has publicized for technology advancements when it comes to Tesla vehicles. A report from CNBC notes a few of those misfires, including in 2015 when Musk told shareholders full autonomous driving was only three years away; in 2016 when Musk said a Tesla vehicle would be able to drive across the country without any human intervention by 2017; and in 2019 when the Tesla CEO said his company would have 1 million robotaxi-ready vehicles on the road in 2020.', '“Tesla yet again claimed it is a year or two away from actual automated driving — just as the company has been claiming for a decade. Indeed, Tesla’s whole event had a 2014 vibe, except that in 2014 there were no automated vehicles actually deployed on public roads,” Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies automated vehicles, told the Associated Press in an email. “Now there are real AVs carrying real people on real roads, but none of those vehicles are Teslas. Tonight did not change this reality; it only made the irony more glaring.”', 'While Tesla, which launched its first vehicle in 2008, has dominated U.S. electric vehicle sales for years, the company’s market share has been in decline in the face of a growing slate of electric vehicle offerings by competitors. Tesla’s share of the domestic EV market fell below 50% for the first time ever in the second quarter of this year, but sales remain well ahead of all other U.S. makers.', 'Utah Today', ""Get all the news that's happening in the Beehive State in one place, as well as major national and world news that you value."", '', '', '', '', '']"
