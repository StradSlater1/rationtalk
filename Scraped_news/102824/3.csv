Apple also released the PCC source code and said that as part of its bug bounty program, vulnerabilities that researchers discover in PCC will be eligible for a maximum bounty payout of up to $1 million.', ""Over the summer, Politico, The New York Times, and The Washington Post each revealed that they’d been approached by a source offering hacked Trump campaign emails—a source whom the US Justice Department says was working on behalf of the Iranian government. The news outlets all refused to publish or report on those stolen materials. Now it appears that Iran’s hackers did eventually find outlets outside the mainstream media that were willing to release those emails. American Muckrakers, a PAC run by a Democratic operative, did publish the documents after soliciting them in a public post on X, writing, “Send it to us and we'll get it out.”"", 'American Muckrakers then published internal Trump campaign communications about North Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson and Florida Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, as well as material that seemed to suggest a financial arrangement between Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the third-party candidate who dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein also received and published some of the hacked material, including a research profile on Trump running mate and US senator J.D. Vance that the campaign assembled when assessing him for the role. Klippenstein subsequently received a visit from the FBI, he’s said, warning him that the documents were shared as part of a foreign influence campaign. Klippenstein has defended his position, arguing that the media should not serve as ""gatekeeper of what the public should know.”', 'As Russia has both waged war and cyberwar against Ukraine, it’s also carried out a vast campaign of hacking against another neighbor to the West with whom it’s long had a fraught relationship: Georgia. Bloomberg this week revealed ahead of the Georgian election how Russia systematically penetrated the smaller country’s infrastructure and government in a yearslong series of digital intrusion operations. From 2017 to 2020, for instance, Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, hacked Georgia’s Central Election Commission (just as it did in Ukraine in 2014), multiple media organizations, and IT systems at the country’s national railway company—all in addition to the attack on Georgian TV stations that the NSA pinned on the GRU’s Sandworm unit in 2020. Meanwhile, hackers known as Turla, working for the Kremlin’s KGB successor the FSB, broke into Georgia’s Foreign Ministry and stole gigabytes of officials’ emails over months. According to Bloomberg, Russia’s hacking efforts weren’t limited to espionage, but also appeared to include preparing for disruption of Georgian infrastructure like the electric grid and oil companies in the event of an escalating conflict.', 'For years, cybersecurity professionals have argued about what constitutes a cyberattack. An intrusion designed to destroy data, cause disruption, or sabotage infrastructure? Yes, that’s a cyberattack. A hacker breach to steal data? No. A hack-and-leak operation or an espionage mission with a disruptive clean-up phase? Probably not, but there’s room for debate. The Jerusalem Post this week, however, achieved perhaps the clearest-cut example of calling something a cyberattack—in a headline no less—that is very clearly not: disinformation on social media. The so-called “Hezbollah cyberattack” that the news outlet reported was a collection of photos of Israeli hospitals posted by “hackers” identifying as Hezbollah supporters that suggested weapons and cash were stored underneath them and that they should be attacked. The posts seemingly came in response to the Israeli Defense Forces’ repeating similar claims about hospitals in Gaza that the IDF has bombed, as well as another more recently in Lebanon’s capital city of Beirut.', '“These are NOT CYBERATTACKS,” security researcher Lukasz Olejnik, the author of the books The Philosophy of Cybersecurity and Propaganda, wrote next to a screenshot of the Jerusalem Post headline on X. “Posting images to social media is not hacking. Such a bad take.”', 'Politics Lab: Get the newsletter and listen to the podcast', 'The American who waged a tech war on China', 'High-end fashion dupes are soaring where knock-offs never could', 'Anyone can turn you into an AI chatbot.

Chinese hackers said to have collected audio of American calls,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/27/chinese-hackers-cellphones-trump/,"['The hackers are said to be part of a Chinese government-affiliated group that American researchers have dubbed Salt Typhoon.', 'Chinese state-affiliated hackers have collected audio from the phone calls of U.S. political figures, according to three people familiar with the matter. Those whose calls have been intercepted include an unnamed Trump campaign adviser, said one of the people.', 'The hackers are said to be part of a Chinese government-affiliated group that American researchers have dubbed Salt Typhoon. They were able to collect audio on a number of calls as part of a wide-ranging espionage operation that began months ago, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a federal investigation is underway. The government is still seeking to determine how much audio the hackers have, one of the people said.', 'They were also able to access unencrypted communications, including text messages, of the individual, the people said. End-to-end encrypted communications such as those on the Signal platform are believed to have not been hacked, they said.', 'The development heightens concerns over the extent of the infiltration as the 2024 election is in high gear as well as the potential threat to long-term national security.', 'Follow Election 2024', 'The FBI declined to comment on the matter.

The hackers targeted the phones of former president Donald Trump, who is running to regain the White House, and his running mate JD Vance, the New York Times first reported Friday. They were thought to have targeted information about call logs, and there is no evidence so far that the hackers listened in on calls of the two Republicans at the top of the ticket.', 'The number of victims identified to date is relatively low — fewer than 100 — but more may emerge as investigations continue, according to two people familiar with the matter.', 'One reason for the restrained victim count at this point may be that the hackers saw the access as “exquisite” or highly valuable and wanted to limit activity to avoid detection, said a former senior U.S. cyber operations official. That would imply that they were not confident of their ability to regain access once detected, the former official said. Or it may be simply that investigators are seeing only the tip of the iceberg, they said.', 'Separately, the Salt Typhoon group is also thought to have targeted the system that tracks lawful requests for wiretaps made by the federal government of carriers. The motive there could be to figure out who the FBI and other federal agencies have under surveillance, said people familiar with the matter.', 'The matter is so serious that the White House earlier this month set up an emergency multiagency team to ensure all relevant agencies have visibility into the investigation. The establishment of a “unified coordination group” triggers a separate mandatory investigation by a public-private Cyber Safety Review Board, which in this case will probe the lapses that led to the intrusions. The board is led by the Department of Homeland Security and includes cyber experts from industry. It’s unclear when the probe will begin, officials said.', 'The wide-ranging operation has involved at least 10 telecom companies, including major carriers such as AT&T, Verizon and Lumen.', 'At least one U.S. official was notified late last week that a personal cellphone had been accessed by the Salt Typhoon hackers, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The hackers were targeting phone logs, SMS text messages and other data on the device, said the person. It was not clear whether audio calls were successfully intercepted for that official, the person said.', 'The hackers have tried to get inside the cellphones used not only by Trump and Vance but also others working on their campaign.', 'As previously reported, Democrats were also targeted in the hacking efforts, including the staff of Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) as well as the Harris campaign, U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Friday, a reflection that the targeting is bipartisan.', 'The Trump-Vance campaign was notified of the targeting by the FBI last week after the attack was discovered by Verizon, the people said. While the campaign is waiting on a full list of individuals that may have been affected, several senior staffers were given new phones.', 'Targeting candidates as well as leaders for espionage is standard practice by world powers, and U.S. officials said they do not consider the latest attempts to be election interference. However, the Trump campaign has sought to blame the White House and Harris for allowing a foreign adversary to infiltrate U.S. companies to target the campaign.', 'It was not clear whether the attempts against Trump and Vance’s phones were successful.', 'The FBI issued its first statement publicly confirming the Salt Typhoon intrusions and its investigation on Friday.', '“The U.S. government is investigating the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China,” the agency said in a joint release with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
