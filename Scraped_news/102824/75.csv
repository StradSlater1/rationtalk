"At 58, I have the spine of an 80-year-old. Navigating osteoporosis has been difficult and expensive",https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/22/osteoporosis-menopause-bone-density-diagnosis-treatment,"['Fifteen months, 11 doctors and over a dozen tests and scans later, I still have no idea how to treat it', 'On 16 June 2023, I got my first Dexa scan. I was 57. Three hours later, a rogue driver plowed his car into mine and shattered my wrist in three places.', 'Fifty-seven is relatively young for a Dexa – or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry – scan, which measures bone density, or the amount of calcium and minerals in your bones. The CDC recommends them for women 65 and over, but while interviewing Joanna Strober, CEO of Midi Health, a virtual care clinic for those in perimenopause and menopause, she had urged me to get one sooner. Strober had become alarmed by how many of their fiftysomething patients were finding that they had the bones of an octogenarian.', 'The results of my Dexa scan arrived in my inbox a week after my car crash: I had full-blown osteoporosis.', 'I was still recovering from multiple injuries, so the diagnosis took a back seat. I was also under the impression – because of my age, ignorance and the invisible, pain-free pathogenesis of osteoporosis – that loss of bone mass was less of an immediate threat to my health and wellbeing than my visible injuries. But, in fact, my osteoporosis had made me more susceptible to that broken wrist. Without intervention, osteoporotic bones simply deteriorate and grow increasingly more brittle with age. They also take longer to heal from fractures.', 'I can attest to that: 15 months later, it still hurts to hold a pitcher of water.', 'Osteoporosis comes from osteo (from ostéon, Greek for bone) and poros (Greek for pore or passage). It describes just that: a hollowing out and reduction of bone mass such that the tiny holes that naturally occur in our bones widen into a gaping, irregular lattice. Osteoporosis occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women. A woman in her 50s has a 14% chance of having it. By age 80, she has a 70% chance.', 'It begins when the creation of new bone can no longer keep up with the loss of old bone. These hollowed-out bones are far more prone to breakage, particularly in the hip, spine and, yes, wrist. The survival rate for women, following a hip fracture, is worse than most cancers: half will be dead in five years. Yes, men get osteoporosis, too, but the percentages are much lower. A crude estimate for men over 50 is 4.2%, and authorities don’t recommend routine bone density testing, either for men or for women my age.', 'But if I’ve learned anything over the course of my work reporting on women’s health, it’s that most of what we’ve been told often turns out to be wrong, and none of it has been sufficiently studied, if at all. Unsurprisingly, trying to figure out how to treat my osteoporosis has only confirmed this.', 'I\nhad several risk factors for osteoporosis: small body frame (5ft 2in, thin), family history (including a great aunt who died from a broken hip), ethnicity (white; Asians are also more prone) and a prior history of fractures. So my primary care provider had agreed it couldn’t hurt to get a Dexa scan at 57 as a baseline. At my annual physical, my vitamin D levels were below normal – another red flag. My gynecologist also thought it a good idea and ordered the scan, which took three months to schedule.', 'The resulting diagnosis of full-blown osteoporosis shocked me. I’m an active woman in good shape for my age. I don’t smoke or drink. I eat a balanced diet. I do yoga twice weekly, ride my bike and walk 10,000 steps every day. Yet my Dexa results were similar to those of an 80-year-old woman.', 'Dexa scan results include T-score numbers, which indicate how many standard deviation units below the mean the subject’s bones have deteriorated in three key places for breakage: lumbar spine, femoral neck and hip. The mean is 0, for a healthy young person with strong bones. Any score between -1 and 0 is considered healthy. Scores from -1 to -2.5 point to osteopenia, which is less a clinical diagnosis and more an indication that bone mass loss has begun. Any score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.', 'My hip T-score was -2, but my lumbar spine T-score was -3.2; my left femoral neck was -2.7. “The patient has Osteoporosis lumbar spine, left femoral neck,” the radiologist wrote in my report. “Patient fracture risk is elevated.”', 'After recovering from the crash, I set out in search of answers. But even I, a woman who writes about women’s health, had no idea which specialist to contact. An orthopedist? A rheumatologist? An endocrinologist? A gerontologist? Some combination of all four?', 'The consensus among friends, family and Google was to seek out an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists treat diseases of hormonal imbalance. Osteoporosis, I was surprised to learn, is a hormone-related disease – a drop in estrogen or an overactive thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal gland can all weaken bones.', 'But the sole endocrinologist in network for my insurance who was taking new patients did not have an appointment for another six months.', 'While I waited, I scheduled a Zoom with Dr Mary O’Connor, an orthopedic surgeon I’d previously interviewed for the launch of her book, Taking Care of You: The Empowered Woman’s Guide to Better Health. At her urging, I added a daily 2000 IU Vitamin D3 supplement and upped my intake of calcium-rich foods. “If you don’t have adequate vitamin D3,” she explained, “you cannot absorb the calcium that you eat.” She also suggested lifting weights, so I bought some dumbbells and found a 30-minute online workout I actually liked.', 'While researching specialists, I noticed that many rheumatologists included osteoporosis as an area of expertise. They mostly treat connective tissue disorders, but I figured they could at least do the bloodwork I needed.', 'Dr Lauren Wong, a rheumatologist from NYU Langone, one of those rare physicians who treats you as an equal, ordered a ton of that bloodwork. At my follow-up, she had some answers. “You have hyperparathyroidism,” she told me: my PTH, or parathyroid hormone, levels had come back unnaturally high. Parathyroid hormone, she explained, regulates our calcium levels, and too much parathyroid hormone can contribute to osteoporosis by triggering the release of calcium from bone stores. Wong agreed I needed to see an endocrinologist and possibly a parathyroid surgeon after that.', '“Hyperpara … what?” I’d never heard of this hard-to-pronounce disease.', 'My endocrinology appointment was still several months away – God bless America – so I sought the advice of Dr Babak Larian, a parathyroid surgeon in LA with an excellent YouTube channel about hyperparathyroidism. Over Zoom, Larian told me he thought it was absolutely ridiculous that women in this country are advised to get Dexa scans at 65, given that menopause begins in our late 40s or early 50s. “I think 50 should be the standard,” he said.', 'Larian also explained that we have extremely poor statistics on the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in the US. “We’re so far off the mark,” he said, “that I don’t even know where to start the conversation.” Furthermore, “because this is a disease mainly of women, they are [often] not diagnosed”.', 'The Endocrine Society states that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in the US is somewhere between 0.1% and 0.7%; women and African Americans are more prone to it. However, a recent retroactive survey in Canada found that 5% of Canada’s population have some form of hyperparathyroidism. Larian believes hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by menopause, and thus that more than 5% of menopausal women have it. But they are completely unaware of this because its symptoms – such as fatigue, muscle weakness, depression, memory problems – mimic those of menopause, and primary care doctors don’t routinely check women’s blood for high levels of PTH.', 'I redoubled my efforts to find an endocrinologist who could see me sooner and once again failed. But then I came down with another UTI – an annoyingly common event, thanks to genitourinary syndrome of menopause, though I have far fewer now thanks to vaginal estrogen – and my urologist just happened to know a young endocrinologist who was taking on new patients. A breakthrough!', 'Sign up to Well Actually', 'Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life', '', 'The endocrinologist confirmed my hyperparathyroidism diagnosis. So she ordered more scans and tests and asked me to seek out a parathyroid surgeon or two to see if I had an adenoma – a non-cancerous growth on the parathyroid gland and the hallmark of primary hyperparathyroidism – which would then need to be removed.', 'I consulted with two surgeons, neither of whom found an adenoma on a scan, so I didn’t need surgery. Instead, they concluded that I had secondary hyperparathyroidism, brought on by a lack of vitamin D.', 'Getting to the bottom of my osteoporosis was quickly becoming a full-time job. Never mind all the visits themselves – even finding the right doctors, who were in-network, could take hours upon hours of research. At this point, I’d either seen in person or interviewed 10 doctors in total.', 'OK, great, I thought. I know why I have osteoporosis at 57. Now what do I do about it?', 'Luckily, I was already on track. In 2022, I’d started taking estrogen, which the British Menopause Society calls “the treatment of choice for osteoporosis prevention”. The North American Menopause Society’s recent 2022 position paper on hormone therapy also states that estrogen prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk.', 'In an ideal world, I’d have been prescribed estrogen the minute I had my uterus removed in 2012 for another medical issue. But back then, HRT was not the standard of care for any woman, with or without a uterus, as it was still being falsely demonized as causing breast cancer. Could the 10-year gap between my hysterectomy and commencement of hormone therapy have contributed to my osteoporosis? According to a number of doctors I consulted, quite possibly, yes.', 'Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry offers no shortage of drugs for people with osteoporosis – as doctors, friends and relatives readily reminded me – but the deeper I dug into each one, the less I was sure I wanted any of them. Bisphosphonates like Fosomax, often the first drug of choice following an osteoporosis diagnosis, inhibit bone resorption and increase bone mass density. But there isn’t much data on long-term use in younger patients like me. Plus, in rare instances, they have been shown to cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures – exactly the injury I was trying to avoid.', 'Prolia injections target a specific molecule that bone-removing cells need in order to work, but they also make one more susceptible to infections. With my recurring UTIs and concomitant antibiotic resistance, this, too, was a no-go. Also, once you start with Prolia, you have to keep taking it twice a year, and the cost, depending on one’s insurance and eligibility for coupons, can be prohibitive. Forteo, an anabolic that is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone, stimulates the formation of new bone and also boosts bone mineral density, but is contraindicated for people with hypercalcemic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism. Moreover, one of its side effects is dizziness, and I’m a lifelong fainter with low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension – so probably not a great idea if I wanted to avoid falling and breaking more bones.', 'I told my endocrinologist I needed to think about all of this. In the meantime, I asked her to check my PTH levels again. Lo and behold, Dr O’Connor’s vitamin D3 regimen had worked! My PTH levels are now in the normal range, and my hyperparathyroidism is gone.', 'What effect did this have on my skeleton? My endocrinologist thought it would be worthwhile to repeat the Dexa scan at the same office where I got the first one. Alas, their next appointment isn’t until four months from now – a full 18 months after my first scan. In New York City, getting the healthcare I need should be easy. It is not.', '“What if I don’t take anything?” I said to my endocrinologist. “What are my risks if I continue lifting weights to build strength and muscle, taking vitamin D and estrogen, eating calcium rich foods and exercising daily?”', 'Whether to take drugs, she said, was ultimately my choice, but my osteoporosis was serious. “Even a sneeze,” she said, “can break your spine.”', 'Great, I thought. I’ll try to avoid sneezing.', 'Utterly confused, I spoke with oncologist Dr Avrum Bluming, co-author of Estrogen Matters. He calls osteoporosis a disease of decreased bone resilience: the ability of bone to stretch without breaking. Drugs like Fosomax and Prolia treat bone density, he said, but not bone resilience.', 'Here, again, estrogen was key. “Bone mineral density is not a great test for osteoporosis, which is a lack of bone elasticity,” he said. Bone mineral density “does not correlate very well with risk of fracture. What we do know is estrogen does prolong the ability of bone collagen fibers to remain flexible or elastic, and it decreases the risk of serious fracture, especially hip fracture, by up to 50%.”', 'I still wasn’t sure what to do about treatment or where to turn to find out. Should I try to find a different endocrinologist? I called my daughter, who’s in her fourth year of med school, but she had no new insights from her studies.', 'Then, this summer, I read a revelatory new study in Nature co-authored by Dr Muriel Babey, an endocrinologist and researcher at UCSF. Its headline immediately caught my eye: “A maternal brain hormone that builds bone.” In the study, Babey and her colleagues finally answer the question that has been puzzling endocrinologists for over a century: how do the bones of breastfeeding women stay strong and resilient when they are losing so much calcium to milk production? In theory, a lactating mother should have severely osteoporotic bones. (In rare instances, called pregnancy and lactation-associated osteoporosis (PLO), they do.)', 'The answer lies in a newly discovered hormone: CCN3, the so-called Maternal Brain Hormone, which the researchers found almost by accident by studying the hormones of female mice, a rare occurrence as male mice are the norm for most animal studies.', 'When Babey’s team gave CCN3 to female mice who were very old or lacking in estrogen, it doubled the mice’s bone mass and, critically, their bones were more resilient and broke less easily. CCN3 has not yet been tested in humans, but if it works on women the way it works in female mice, Maternal Brain Hormone could be the missing magic bullet in terms of osteoporosis treatment.', 'I contacted Babey to ask if and when the hormone might come to market. “For pharmaceutical application,” she said, “the timeline is usually around five to 10 years”. Too late for me, alas, but it does give me hope that my daughter might have better options if she is diagnosed.', 'I gave Babey a brief history of my osteoporosis journey and the various treatments I’d considered. “What if I do nothing?” I said.', '“I would definitely get another baseline first before even deciding if anabolic treatment will be necessary,” she said. She also suggested I get a mini-trampoline to build balance and strength, and to try exercise programs designed for people with osteoporosis. There is extremely limited data, she stressed, on the benefits of so-called rebound exercise, but one study did show an increase in bone mass in premenopausal women.', 'Reader, I bought a mini-trampoline. It can’t hurt.', 'Meanwhile, I’m still taking estrogen and incessantly calling my radiologist’s office to get an earlier appointment. Until then, I will hold off on drugs, and I will try not to sneeze or get in any more car accidents.', '“Just don’t fall!” an older friend recently advised me with a shrug and a smile, when I asked how she manages her osteoporosis. As I made my way through the large stack of medical bills on my desk from this 15-month odyssey, wondering which to pay now and which to try to push off until later, this seemed as good as advice as any.', 'Deborah Copaken, founder and editor of Ladyparts, is an award-winning journalist, photographer, screenwriter, and the New York Times bestselling author of seven books, including Shutterbabe, The Red Book, and Ladyparts.', 'The headline of this article was amended on 22 October 2024 to reflect that the writer is now 58.']"
Feel it in your bones: taking the pain out of osteoporosis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/27/feel-it-in-your-bones-taking-the-pain-out-of-osteoporosis,"['More than half the women in the UK over the age of 50 will suffer a fracture. But can more awareness – and some heavy lifting – help us beat many of the effects of osteoporosis?', 'I\nmagine a room full of women. Imagine half of them breaking a bone. What will it be? Hip? Spine? Wrist? Neck? Imagine the plaster casts, the metal screws, the pain, the immobility, the grief – a third of those who break a hip will die within a year, according to the NHS. The Royal Osteoporosis Society says one in two women over 50 in the UK will get a fracture due to osteoporosis. And that just doesn’t need to happen.', 'Thanks to many factors, including neglect and gender bias in medicine, midlife women are not told about the simple preventive measures they can take to maintain healthy bones. “Your bones are silent until they break. And then they scream,” says Dr Vonda Wright, a campaigning American orthopaedic surgeon and the author of Fitness After 40: How to Stay Strong at Any Age.', 'Two-thirds of osteoporosis sufferers are female for a reason: when hormones plummet around menopause, bone strength declines by 10 to 20%. Fragility fractures rocket up from the late 40s onwards. Low bone mineral density means brittle bones look like a Crunchie bar inside, honeycombed with big holes.', 'When Narelle Chidwick from Henley was 49, she was sent for a Dexa (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry bone scan) by the NHS after injuring her ribs during a family skiing holiday. “They told me I had osteoporosis, a high fracture risk and very low bone density. It was at the level of an 80 or 90-year-old woman. I was shocked. I didn’t see it coming. I had early menopause at 46, but I’d been exercising, doing pilates, eating well.” Now Chidwick and her 80-year-old father both have osteoporosis – but she is determined to try to rebuild her bones.', 'There are three very effective early ways to protect women (and some non-binary and trans people) from fractures: muscle-building, weight-bearing exercise, along with vitamin D, magnesium and calcium-rich foods, and using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to slow bone loss and promote new growth.', '“We need to identify high-risk women far earlier, long before they break a bone,” says Dr Olivia Hum, a GP and menopause specialist on the British Menopause Society (BMS) advisory council. “Women with low body mass, a history of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis in the family and those who smoke or drink heavily, or had an eating disorder. They need to know about strength training and exercise, discuss the benefits and risks of HRT and understand that it can significantly reduce fracture risk.”', 'The BMS consensus statement says that HRT “remains an excellent option for prevention, particularly in younger women aged less than 60,” helping women at low risk (with osteopenia, slightly lowered bone density) and even those with established osteoporosis.', 'While it has proved almost impossible for the NHS to get the sedentary midlife population skipping ropes or lifting weights, it is easy to offer HRT to those suitable. It is approved by the NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration for strengthening bones, as the oestrogen in HRT plays a role in maintaining bone density, balancing the constant removal and regrowth that occurs in menopause. It decreases menopause symptoms, too, which often encourages women to exercise and have a healthier lifestyle.', 'An Endocrine Review meta-analysis of 57 studies showed HRT can increase bone density by 7% on average over two years and reduce spinal fractures by a third. A decade-long trial in the journal Bone showed HRT increased spinal density by 13%, while the untreated comparison group had 5% bone loss. We also know now that headlines two decades ago suggesting HRT increased breast cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative Study were exaggerated, and have been debunked by menopause societies. Newer body-identical transdermal preparations, such as gels and patches are safer, too, with no increased risk of blood clots, according to the NHS.', 'Yet healthcare professionals dealing with early fractures rarely consider that option. With a research grant from Henpicked: Menopause in the Workplace, I have worked on an investigation for months with Dr Bill Robertson-Smith, an NHS senior surgical care practitioner at Northampton General Hospital. She sent Freedom of Information requests asking for data from the NHS Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) which treats osteoporosis following fractures in people over 50.', 'Our data showed that in the past seven years, 356,229 women have been treated by FLS clinics. Out of those, only 169 were offered HRT afterwards. “I was astonished it was so low,” said Dr Robertson-Smith. “Around three-quarters of those women would be over 65, but thousands of younger women in their 50s and early 60s who could benefit from HRT were never offered that option.”', 'Although early menopausal, Chidwick was not offered HRT by her GP, but she was prescribed bisphosphonate drugs, as well as calcium carbonate and vitamin D. Bisphosphonates inhibit the removal of old bone, particularly when new bone is forming less in menopause – bones are a bit like tree branches, growing, shedding and renewing all the time. Bisphosphonates cost from £50 a year and are the first-line NHS treatment for men and women. But patients often complain of gastrointestinal, joint and flu-like symptoms. Due to that, and perceived lack of effect, around 40% of patients come off bisphosphonates within a year, and 85% within three. Chidwick also looked into lifestyle changes, and was exasperated to receive a hospital letter suggesting she walked for 30 minutes three times a week. “I knew that wasn’t anywhere near enough for bone density – I was already walking 10,000 steps a day and exercising when I got the diagnosis,” she said. Chidwick did her own bone-building research online and found a trainer who was able to create a three-times-a-week strength and impact exercise programme.', 'Muscles are key to osteoporosis prevention, to holding up our skeletons, explains Dr Gabrielle Lyon, American author of the bestseller Forever Strong. “People think of bones as the end point of this silent disease, but low muscle mass is the first sign of low bone density. The best way to safeguard your independence is to protect your skeletal muscle mass. Muscle is the only organ system we can directly control.”', 'Also in the States, Dr Wright is leading the charge on female osteoporosis, academically and with a million followers on her Instagram. Wright, 57, explains: “I lift heavy! You need deadlifts, squats, bench-presses, chin-ups. Four reps, four sets. You can also stomp up and down the stairs and that helps, too.” She adds: “Building muscle is the one thing you can do to save your metabolism, save your bones, prevent you from falling down and build brain resilience.”', 'Dr Wright also authored a groundbreaking 2024 medical paper in the journal Climacteric, which named the problem for the first time in its title: The Musculoskeletal Syndrome of Menopause. “This means the collection of symptoms caused by oestrogen loss from perimenopause onwards, including joint pain, muscle weakness, decreased bone density and increased risk of arthritis and fractures. Oestrogen doesn’t just increase bone density, it reduces inflammation in our joints. So many women come into my clinic with frozen shoulder at this age, not due to injury, but because of inflammation.”', 'In the paper, Dr Wright advocates holistically for exercise, vitamins and nutrition (one of her catchphrases is “Sugar bakes you from the inside,” because it’s inflammatory). She also calls for greater use of HRT. She says what’s needed now is a study of the minimum effective doses of oestrogen for prevention. Studies show a small dose of 0.25mg/day works well, which would be good news for women who want to start HRT gently in later life, and Dr Wright said that’s definitely an option. “It’s crazy that women here usually only get Dexa scans once they are 65, when earlier screening would mean we could halt the damage.”', 'Dr Hum agrees: “GPs can refer you for a Dexa if you fulfil the risk criteria, but sometimes we feel as if we’re just firefighting in general practice and there’s so little time to talk.” She suggests that women can determine their own risk using the risk-checker on the Royal Osteoporosis Society website, and Dexa scans are available privately for upwards of £50. She also said that with more menopause awareness, some women come in asking for HRT to protect their bones, even if they don’t have serious symptoms. “It’s all about individual choice and the risk-benefit balance.”', 'Exercise is essential as part of that balance. The science around high intensity impact training (Hiit) also interested Chidwick. Hiit is proven to improve bone density in postmenopausal women, and in the American LIFTMOR trial, 101 women over 58 with osteoporosis or osteopenia were assigned to two groups. Those in the conventional exercise group had a 1% loss of bone density, while those doing supervised high-intensity impact training – squats, deadlifts and jumping chin-ups twice a week – gained almost 3% density over eight months. It worked fast.', 'Why aren’t we getting that message out to women? “Because we’re the Special K generation,” says Chidwick. Gen X grew up with messages favouring skinny over strong. Remember the Special K TV challenge from two decades ago, which told women they could “drop a jeans size in two weeks” by replacing two meals with bowls of sugary cereal? More than three decades after Madonna flexed her biceps on the Blond Ambition tour, there’s still a sense for older generations that muscles are male.', 'Loss of muscle mass is called sarcopenia – and muscle mass can drop by 10% from early perimenopause to post-menopause. Dr Radhika Vohra, a GP and adviser to the Menopause Charity, agrees and wishes the NHS provided more specific information: “We’d be better doing more social prescribing, sending people on the NHS for six weeks’ free training at a gym – but sadly that’s a postcode lottery.”', 'Strong muscles make a big difference to balance, too, important if osteoporosis has been diagnosed. Dr Wright talked about the tragedy of seeing frail women after falls, in hospital gowns undergoing massive operations, asking her, “what’s happened to me? I’m not who I used to be.” What actually happens in hospital? I spoke to Dr Robertson-Smith one day as she emerged after working alongside a senior surgeon on a peri-prosthetic fracture: “That’s when they’ve had a metal hip replacement, for example, and have now fractured the bone around it, too. We’ve been operating for nearly three hours on a woman in her 80s, and I’ve just finished screwing a plate on to the length of the upper thigh and suturing the wound.”', 'The operation takes its toll on an already frail patient and, including rehab afterwards, costs the NHS about £30,000, according to Dr Robertson-Smith. On the front line for the past 11 years, she has grown increasingly frustrated by the lack of preventive care. “The use of HRT wasn’t part of my education in orthopaedics,” she says, “and medical colleagues have said the same.” But medicine works in silos and menopause experts, surgeons, endocrinologists and rheumatologists rarely confer. So the more complex picture is often overlooked. It’s the orchestra of hormones that makes bones work.', 'Dr Robertson-Smith explains: “The main role of oestrogen in bone health is to prevent bone loss, but we also know that progesterone has an important part to play in stimulating bone growth. There is also a positive association between testosterone and bone mineral density, so all of these hormones matter.” Men with early low testosterone levels are more likely to get osteoporosis, too.', 'NHS data shows 19% of women are on HRT, a massive increase over the past three years as public menopause knowledge has grown, so that may mean a generational improvement in osteoporosis rates. But increasing prevention would be bad news for the pharmaceutical industry, which makes $16bn worldwide annually from osteoporosis drugs. Pharmaceutical capitalism thrives on sickness care, rather than preventive care.', 'What really needs to change is that preventive care should be offered to women at a much younger age, ideally in their 40s. Dr Vohra explains that the 40-plus health-check list for all women doesn’t mention osteoporosis or menopause, instead concentrating on high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, body mass index, exercise and alcohol. “General practice gets paid to keep a register of patients already diagnosed with osteoporosis, but they don’t get paid for preventing it. Yet osteopenia is that lovely window when you can change things for women, and we miss it.”', 'Dr Hum agrees: “This needs to be done at a national level. GPs need to have the time and resources so they can be involved with prevention.”', 'Dr Vohra has done groundbreaking research on menopause and ethnicity in the UK. A report in the journal Bone showed Asian women are at a similar risk of osteoporosis as white women, yet only 6% use HRT. Risk for Black women is slightly lower, but only 5% use HRT. “Menopause care is lacking for people from economically deprived and ethnic backgrounds. There’s more early menopause, too. Disparities in nutrition, education and poverty mean women are losing bone mineral density earlier and are less likely to get help. We need to be proactive.”', 'This is a significant public health issue costing the NHS £4.6bn a year for women and men. The Royal Osteoporosis Society says a quarter of people don’t even know what “osteoporosis” means, so we need a public and social media conversation, as there has been for menopause.', 'The lack of education remains incredibly frustrating, says Chidwick. “What if I’d been given a Dexa scan when I went into early menopause? This is all about mortality and it’s not OK. I want to have a life, so what do I do? I’ve gone out and asked questions, but what about the people who don’t? Putting a Band-Aid on afterwards isn’t working.”', 'Kate Muir (@menoscandal) is the author of Everything You Need to Know About the Menopause, published by Simon & Schuster at £9.99.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 30 percent of postmenopausal women globally suffer from osteoporosis, highlighting a pressing issue that requires urgent attention.', 'In India, the peak incidence of osteoporosis occurs 10 to 20 years earlier than in Western countries, leading to substantial impacts on health and economic resources. This premature onset not only increases the risk of fractures and related complications but also places a heavy burden on healthcare systems and families.', 'Dr. Aashish Chaudhry, Director and Head of the Department of Orthopaedics and Joint Replacement at Aakash Healthcare, sheds light on this condition, emphasising its prevalence among postmenopausal women and the elderly.', 'What is osteoporosis, and why is it a concern for public health?', 'Dr Chaudhry: Osteoporosis in simple terms is called hollowness or weakening of the bones or the skeletal system and it usually occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women and elderly males as well. Now, two major categories of osteoporosis one is senile osteoporosis other is postmenopausal osteoporosis, both are age related and also in females because of the menopause there is a sudden drop in estrogen level which is actually a protector of the bone hormone which protects the bone and because of its loss the first 5 years after the menopause it causes severe osteoporosis and it is a concern for public health because since being a silent disease it is not easily diagnosed and most of the people consider generalized weakness bone pains as age related and then it goes unnoticed until the terminal event of a major fracture or after a trivial injury happens and then that leads to catastrophic complications.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Copyright @ 2024.
