Venom: The Last Dance raises questions only a true comics fan could answer,https://www.polygon.com/movies/470588/venom-3-last-dance-every-symbiote-knull-cameras-guy-explained,"['And a few questions that no one could answer', 'BY TASHA ROBINSON AND SUSANA POLO', 'Venom: The Last Dance may be one of those “You just had to be there” experiences. It feels cluttered, confused, and yet remarkably inconsequential. We’re told that the entire universe is at stake in this story, and yet nothing in the movie feels particularly threatening or even meaningful. So many different threads, ideas, and characters are introduced and then dispensed with, ignored, or contradicted, to the point where nothing lands — not even the supposed ending of this movie series.', 'As Polygon’s entertainment editor, I’ve learned that when a comic book movie baffles me this much, I’m probably missing something that was mangled from the source material. It’s always possible the story made more sense in its original form. So I turn to our resident comics super-expert Susana to help me unpack what I just saw. I asked her my big questions from Venom: The Last Dance to see if there’s any way bringing in some extra background lore could help save this messy, overstuffed, suspiciously goofy movie.', '[Ed. note: Widespread spoilers ahead for Venom: The Last Dance.]', 'Tasha: Susana, let’s start with the McGuffin at the center of this movie: The codex, a nigh-magical hoobajoo that only the Eddie Brock/Venom symbiote (both voiced by Tom Hardy) share, and that the movie’s villain, Knull (Andy Serkis) wants, for Reasons.', 'Did you follow any of that, Susana? We’re told Venom has a codex because Eddie died at some point in these movies, and the symbiote revived him. But the film pretty pointedly doesn’t explain what a codex is or why it would be so rare, much less why it would work as a key to break Knull out of cosmic prison.', 'Susana: That’s easy enough — the “codex” is an idea adapted from Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman’s 2018 run on Venom. In the comics, a “codex” is a little trace of symbiote stuff that symbiotes naturally leave behind in the bodies of their hosts, particularly the nervous system. In a pinch, it can be used to tap into the symbiote hivemind. (In the comics, all symbiotes are connected in a species-wide hivemind, natch.)', 'In comics, it isn’t one codex that’s the key to freeing Knull, but lots and lots of codexes. That’s the main difference here: In the comics, codexes are the furthest thing from rare. They literally happen any time a symbiote bonds with a host for more than a fleeting moment. And thanks to the Venomverse and Venomized events, which were based around symbiotes bonding with all your favorite characters so you can see how cool they look in a Venom-ized suit, basically everybody of note in the Marvel Comics universe has a codex.', 'Knull was freed in the Absolute Carnage event, in which a Knull-communing Carnage went on a spree of ripping out people’s spines and eating them, in order to connect their codexes up to Knull, which would allow the god to regain control of the symbiote hivemind.', 'Does that help?', 'Tasha: In a way! It at least tells me more than the movie does about what a codex is supposed to be or how one is formed. And I can see why people making a movie would want to switch the dynamic from “This thing is available all over the universe” to “Our protagonist is a unique and special snowflake, and his McGuffin means the action will follow him from scene to scene, wherever he goes.”', 'So why would a codex/a lot of codexes free Knull from alien space jail? And given that we get no information about him in this movie except “He’s the god of symbiotes, and also, they hate him,” is there a backstory to him that would make him make more sense? Like, why does he want to destroy the universe, and why would this rando death-metal-guitarist guy have the power to destroy the universe?', 'Susana: In Cates and Stegman’s comics, Knull is a primordial god of the void, who ruled over the formless black nothing that stretched between the destruction of the 6th Cosmos and the creation of the 7th (our current one). He sees anything that isn’t the darkness of empty space as an encroachment on his domain.', 'Tasha: That is the most metal thing you’ve ever said.', 'Susana: Oh, I’m just getting started. Being the Most Metal is what cosmic superhero comics are all about!', 'When the Celestials started making the 7th Cosmos, Knull took that as an insult. Bathed for the first time in the light of creation, the god of the void reached into his own shadow and created the first symbiote, in the form of the Celestial-killing blade All-Black, the Necrosword. (All-Black was invented by Jason Aaron and Esad Ribić for their series Thor: God of Thunder. Cates and Stegman retroactively gave it an origin with Knull.)', 'The Celestials cast Knull back into the void, but he spent his time manifesting symbiote life from pure darkness, creating a shape-shifting, parasitic horde species fully controlled by a hivemind linked with his own divine consciousness. Then he launched that horde into the universe to devour all that it found.', 'Eventually, Knull’s control momentarily lapsed after a big fight with a young Thor (immortalized by human storytellers as the epic of Beowulf), and his symbiote army bonded with mortal hosts, discovering the concepts of “honor” and “nobility,” as Knull put it. The freed symbiotes rose up and imprisoned Knull in a massive ball of their own bodies, which, until 2018’s Venom #4, had always been understood to simply be the symbiote home planet.', 'Tasha: OK, gross. And this is why the symbiotes in Venom: The Last Dance are willing to bond with any and every human, including the ones who imprisoned them in tubes in an underground bunker, if it helps them fight off his creatures?', 'Susana: By comics canon, yeah. The symbiotes hate him because he was a god-tyrant, and they don’t like being his slaves. He wants to kill the universe because it is anathema to him. And he can do it because he’s a primordial cosmic entity.', 'Tasha: And why does he have an army of unkillable CG mega-bugs?', 'Susana: Oh, those are from a completely unrelated Venom comic. I got nothin’.', 'Tasha: Speaking of unrelated Venom stuff, I assumed all those symbiotes who show up for the big battle at the end and have distinctive colors and powers are from the comics? That whole sequence smelled like fan-candy to me, apart from the fact that most of those characters immediately get mulched. Was there anyone in there that Venom fans would care about?', 'Susana: It’s basically fan candy, but for just… an unspeakably small group of fans. The list of times Marvel Comics creators have tried to make a new symbiote/host hero or villain stick is longer than my arm, and most of them don’t rate more than a footnote. I’m checking wikis for all of these guys, but the ones on display seem to be based on Toxin (Officer Mulligan’s green form), and five more symbiotes roughly inspired by Venom: Lethal Protector. That 1993 miniseries, written by David Michelinie and drawn by several artists, introduced a litter of high-key toyetic offspring of the Venom symbiote.', 'Those five symbiotes were Riot (gray, turns his hands into hammers, etc.), Phage (brown, turns his limbs into spikes), Lasher (green, has extra back tentacles, attaches to the lady with a Christmas tree pin), Agony (purple, uses hair tentacles, attaches to Juno Temple’s Dr. Teddy Payne), and Scream (orange/yellow, also weaponized hair), and they seem to be the templates for Last Dance’s extra symbiotes. It’s complicated, though, because the movie doesn’t name any of them, and Riot was technically already used as the villain of 2018’s Venom (played by Riz Ahmed).', 'There’s also a two-headed symbiote at one point, but that one seems to be an original design, as best as I can research.', 'Tasha: How big a deal is Agony in the comics? Big enough to support her own movie? While The Last Dance’s post-credits scene leaves Sony a possible opening for a further Venom sequel, the film (title and all) seems to be aimed at shutting down the Tom Hardy Venom series, though Hardy has signaled he’d return if Venom got to fight Tom Holland’s Spider-Man in another Sony Spiderverse/MCU crossover.', 'So much of the way this movie treats Dr. Payne — as if her motivations and backstory are important, even though she doesn’t actually do much in the film, and as if her getting her own symbiote is a climactic, cathartic triumph for the story — only really makes sense if this movie is also being positioned as an Agony origin story that could be used to launch a new symbiote franchise. Which feels a lot like Sony trying to use Madame Web as a cinematic origin story for a bunch of new Spider-Women, but I digress. Clearly Agony doesn’t have Venom’s cultural cachet, but is there anything notable or interesting about her that could support a movie?', 'Susana: So, Teddy Payne appears to be a genderbent version of Dr. Thaddeus Paine, who featured as the villain of 1996’s Venom: The Hunger, by writer Len Kaminski and artist Ted Halsted. But his backstory has nothing in common with Dr. Payne’s other than a homophonic name and the fact that they’re both scientists, and he’s never merged with a symbiote in comics history. Payne is, in everything but name, an original character.', 'As for Agony, I’m going to be honest with you as a comics expert: If I’ve ever read a story with Agony in it, I don’t remember. Commenters are free to call that a gap in my knowledge, but I’m going to call it an indication of Agony’s lack of an established footprint in Marvel Comics canon.', 'Tasha: I mean, I’ve never read a Venom-centric comic, and I knew who Venom was well before the first movie, but I had to ask you who Agony was. I’m coming to all of this in ignorance, so I’m sure not going to claim you should know more about a character I’ve never heard of.', 'Speaking of characters I’ve never heard of, though, any idea who the mysterious guy in the control room is? The secretive silhouetted guy who’s so important that he can single-handedly shift control of the apparently massive government-run Imperium project from Dr. Payne to General Strickland on a moment’s notice? The guy who has somehow put up identical networked facial-recognition surveillance cameras all around the world, from downtown Vegas to random alleys in Mexico? Clearly this dude, whose presence and power and intentions and motives are never explained, is some really important and exciting comics reference, right?', 'Susana: I have no fucking idea who that man is. Maybe we’ll find out in Kraven the Hunter. Maybe it was just a dropped plotline.', 'Tasha: I admit that after seeing the first Kraven trailer in a theater last week, I have a really hard time believing the tone that movie seems to be going for could jibe at all with the hot-nonsense tone Venom: The Last Dance is keyed to. Speaking of which… A lot baffled me about this movie, including how the Venom symbiote is constantly abusing and overruling Eddie — literally ripping food out of his mouth or shoving food into it, grabbing and controlling his body, not to mention wrecking his career, his relationships, and his life. And yet Eddie calls the thing his best friend.', 'But the thing that alarmed me the most was when Eddie wants to leave Vegas ahead of the various threats coming after them, and the symbiote wants to hang out and dance with Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu), who… really seems to have a thing for Venom. I mean, the whole “Dancing Queen” scene is clearly a goof, but it also involves kinda hentai levels of tentacle-caressing. (Completely apart from being a sequence that makes no sense, since the symbiote is clearly scared of the Xenophage coming after him and Eddie, and yet after an hour of avoiding merging into Venom because it’s dangerous, he drops that concern entirely in order to force Eddie into a dance sequence.) Is Venom… flirting? Do I have to consider Venom a sexual being now?', 'Susana: Do you have to consider Venom a sexual being now? I don’t know if that’s my question to answer, Tasha. What a man and his goo-monster do in the privacy of their own home is none of my business.', 'I didn’t read that sequence as having a flirtatious vibe, but that might have been because I was furiously scribbling notes on how wild it was to cut to that scene from one of Dr. Payne sadly contemplating the childhood loss of her twin brother.', 'Tasha: I mean, what they do in the privacy of their own home is one thing, what they do in a Vegas penthouse is… well, even as I’m typing this, I’m realizing that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I’m just saying, there are already so many consent problems around Eddie and his bestie and their merged Venom form, and this movie really seems like it’s aimed at feeding the fandom debates (and the fanfiction) about whether Eddie’s tolerance of the symbiote comes from some kind of submissive kink.', 'But the less said about that, the better. I have so many more questions for you here. Why does Area 51 demolish its buildings with vast tanks of acid? Why does acid that dissolves concrete and rebar into dust within seconds not have any effect on the ground or anything below it? Why is a giant never-ending dust waterfall considered a subtle cover-up for a secret base? Why do the acid-tank biometric controls apparently have settings for “some acid” and “more acid” which have to be activated separately?', 'And why does Eddie lie to that poor kid Leaf about aliens not being real? I get that he’s trying to be comforting in the moment, but this is a universe where not believing in aliens can get you killed extremely messily, and the lie doesn’t come across as helpful, just crass. And cowardly. And ironic. And obviously a setup for Eddie having to take it back 20 minutes later.', 'Susana: Some questions are beyond even the power of your friendly neighborhood comics expert.', 'How I learned to stop worrying and love the ball', 'The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.', '© 2024 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

10 Questions About Venom: The Last Dance,https://www.laineygossip.com/review-venom-the-last-dance-is-about-fan-service-tom-hardys-love-of-dogs/80110,"['What is Venom: The Last Dance?', 'Venom: The Last Dance is the third and probably final entry into the Sony’s only successful Spider-Man spin-off franchise, centered on Spider-Man’s rival, Venom. The film stars Tom Hardy in the dual role of Eddie Brock and Venom, who is an alien co-existing with Eddie in a symbiotic relationship. The film is set approximately one year since the events of 2018’s Venom. ', 'That’s a pretty compressed timeline given that six real years have passed. Do they make any attempt to have Tom Hardy look like he did in Venom?', 'None whatsoever. He is noticeably older, which would not matter in the least if they didn’t try that ridiculous “one year later” plot point.', 'What is Venom: The Last Dance about?', 'It is nominally a film about friendship, but it’s mostly about fan service and Tom Hardy’s love of dogs.', 'Wait, is there a Venom DOG in this movie?!', 'Sadly no, even though there is perfect opportunity for such a thing, and the movie does include a Venom horse, Venom fish, and Venom frog. The Venom dog is a HUGE missed opportunity.', 'At any point in this film does Venom leave an airplane crippled mid-flight, suggesting he caused hundreds of people to die in an air disaster that is never mentioned again?', 'What an interesting and specific question! Yes, that exact scenario DOES happen! It seems like it should be the setup for a story in which Venom does a lot of collateral damage while trying to be good, which is why people see him as a villain despite his best efforts to be a hero, but the events of this film happen in a moral vacuum. There is no judgment on anyone or anything except the people running a dogfighting ring and the science lady who suggests that assuming aliens are automatically out to kill us is maybe not the best approach to fostering intergalactic understanding. ', 'Some of the aliens are out to kill us, though, right?', 'Oh, yeah for sure.', 'Why is Rhys Ifans in this movie? Is he connecting Venom to the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies?', 'Nope! He’s playing a brand-new character, a kooky dad hoping to see aliens around Area 51. He performs his role with the elan of a person used to cashing checks from Sony for bad superhero movies. ', 'I was hoping this film would finally bring Tom Hardy’s Venom into the MCU. You know, since he appeared in the post-credits scene for Spider-Man: No Way Home. All I want is to see Tom Hardy as Venom and Tom Holland as Spidey fight. ', 'Expect less and never be disappointed.', 'But surely there is some connective tissue? People love Tom Hardy as Venom. They can’t waste that on these non-Spider-Man Spider-Man movies! ', 'I cannot stress enough how “no expectations” you should have of this film.', 'But then what was the point of all this? Why make three Venom movies and have Tom Hardy cameo in the MCU only to never connect the two? What have we been doing all this time?!', 'The point of anything is simply progression, to flow forward on the river of time and gain experience and wisdom from our happenings and circumstances. We can never go back, we can only move forward, hopefully becoming better and stronger individuals as we do.

Don’t worry about it – the filmmakers can’t be arsed to properly explain it and there’s already enough exposition to make you want to bite off your own head.', ""Enter the Xenophage, an ungodly CGI mash-up of a Xenomorph from the Alien franchise, the skittering arachnid bugs from Starship Troopers, and Cooper, the destructive ET in Super 8. Essentially Knull’s version of a Rottweiler straining on its leash, this outsized, snarling beast can sense Venom whenever he shows himself fully (so why Venom does exactly that simply to strut his stuff to ABBA’s 'Dancing Queen', fun though that might be, is a mystery), zeroing in like a heat-seeking missile."", 'Release date: October 25', 'Available: In theaters', 'Director: Kelly Marcel', 'Runtime: 1h 49m', 'Meanwhile, at the soon-to-be-decommissioned Area 51, Dr. Payne (Juno Temple) studies symbiote matter; franchise cop Mulligan (Stephen Graham), reportedly dead, is in fact proving a stable host to a green symbiote; and General Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor, bringing a grain of gravitas) decides to kill Eddie, or Venom, or both, as soon as he learns of the Codex and its world-ending possibilities.', 'It\'s a lot, but it all boils down to one big chase movie, our body-sharing bros going on the lam (""ROAD TRIP!"" bellows Venom) to escape not just the Xenophage but Strickland and all of his heavily armed, tech-aided goons.', 'A series of largely uninspired, uninvolving set-pieces unfurl in the air (a Xenophage vs. Venom smackdown atop a packed airbus), on the ground (Venom using a ""nice horsey"" as host to gallop across the desert) and underwater (think a sub-aquatic take on Minority Report’s jet-pack chase, with phonier effects). Eventually the plot strands entwine for an extended beast-on-beast(s) climax that, like the finales of the first two movies, quickly devolves into a puddle of pixels that isn’t much fun to splash around in.', '', 'Where Venom: The Last Dance entertains is in the incessant bicker-banter between Eddie and Venom (voiced by Hardy, who, let’s face it, was never going to let anyone else have a crack at doing a gravelly growl on his behalf). The Venom movies occupy a space far more safe and sanitized than the source comics, and the big-screen outings have become increasingly smitten with the odd-couple dynamic as they’ve gone on. ', 'Here, the back-and-forth is unrelenting, but it frequently raises a smile and occasionally an outright guffaw, while it’s also pleasing to see, and hear, just how affectionate these initially fractious companions have grown over three movies. With Michelle Williams’ sadly underused Anne now out of the picture altogether, it’s all about the bromance, and some viewers might even get a little misty eyed over a BFF montage that appears to be entirely serious in its heartstrings-tugging intentions. Others, of course, would gladly swap out the cheese for just a smattering (splattering?) of the carnage offered on the page.', ""Also enjoyable is a cameo from franchise-favorite Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu) and a handful of scenes centered on Rhys Ifans’ hippie family as they head for Area 51 in their VW Campervan, hopeful of spying an ET before the sky falls in on the famous facility. Watching Eddie cringe as mom Nova Moon, kids Leaf and Echo, and dad, er, Martin sing along to Bowie’s 'Space Oddity' is as batshit crazy as Eddie climbing into a high-end restaurant’s lobster tank in the first movie.

While that’s not a bad start for a modestly budgeted superhero movie, the first Venom opened with $80 million, while the sequel – despite coming out during the pandemic, made $90 million in its first frame. The poor CinemaScore rating (B-minus) suggests audiences are suffering from a little bit of superhero fatigue.

With a $40 million gross (so far), Smile 2 will turn a solid profit for Paramount, but it won’t be the money maker the first movie was (although I’d still expect at least one more sequel – which our man Tyler Nichols wrote about at length today).  ', 'Third place ended up being a bit of a pleasant surprise, with Focus Features having a word-of-mouth hit with Edward Berger’s Conclave, which exceeded expectations to gross $6.5 million. With the Ralph Fiennes-led thriller a front-runner for some Oscar nominations, expect this one to stick around theaters for awhile. It’s more-or-less tied with The Wild Robot, which is also reporting $6.5 million for the weekend, with a total gross of $111 million for this well-reviewed family flick.

While those aren’t blockbuster numbers, younger audiences are discovering the film, which is a solid choice for couples on a date. Terrifier 3 slipped to sixth place, with a $4.2 million gross and a $43.1 million total. All-in-all, Art the Clown is leading the film to be one of the year’s most profitable movies. ', 'The global smash hit, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, also continued to pull in solid numbers, with a $3.2 million gross and a $288 million domestic total. Of all the movies on the top 10, the arthouse smash Anora pulled in the biggest per screen average, making $25.5k per screen (more than twice what Venom: The Last Dance did), with an $867k weekend on only thirty-four screens. The Lego animated Pharrell doc, Piece By Piece, made $720k, giving it a low-key $8.8 million total, while Transformers One rounded out the top 10 with a $720k weekend and a $57 million domestic total.', 'The box office doldrums seem set to continue next weekend, with Robert Zemeckis’s Here one of the few wide releases coming out.

Venom: The Last Dance stays firmly in its ridiculous lane,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24277702/venom-the-last-dance-review,"['By Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.', 'Though neither of Sony’s previous standalone Venom movies were cinematic gems, their strange blend of Odd Couple humor and bloodless body horror were enough to put them squarely in so-bad-they’re-kinda-fun territory. It was hard to imagine a Venom feature — let alone a franchise — really working without a Spider-Man in the mix. But the box-office success of the films made it clear that something about Tom Hardy’s take on the lethal protector was working for audiences and all but ensured that Sony would go for a third installment.', 'Venom: The Last Dance from writer / director Kelly Marcel is neither better nor worse than its predecessors. It feels like a film that’s trying to stick to the beats it knows it can pull off well. Instead of diving into the multiverse to wow you with crossovers, the movie plays to the franchise’s strengths with a story that’s mostly about the ups and downs of being in a long-term relationship. And while The Last Dance doesn’t exactly deliver on the iffy but intriguing comic madness Sony has been teasing, it does bring this gooey, gory bit of ridiculous adaptation to a fitting end.', 'As chaotic as the first two Venom films were, they were also a fairly straightforward account of how disgraced journalist Eddie Brock’s (Hardy) life was repeatedly upended by the arrival of Venom (also Hardy), one of many parasitic aliens that crash-landed on Earth. Unlike other symbiote / host bonds that proved to be fatal, Eddie and Venom grew stronger because of their connection and found purpose in one another as they grew accustomed to sharing a body. The two had their fights and hit a big emotional rough patch, but they were always able to work things out when faced with a new deadly threat. The Last Dance picks up soon after Let There Be Carnage, which ended on a cliffhanger in another dimension. ', 'At first, it seems like the movie is using its multiversal connection to the MCU to pivot from its narrative past and start things over in a world filled with Marvel-branded superheroes. But The Last Dance instead decides to keep things focused on just how much has happened to Eddie and Venom in their universe during the surprisingly short amount of time they’ve been together.', 'Especially after Deadpool & Wolverine, the way The Last Dance basically gives the multiverse the middle finger is kind of refreshing and makes it feel like Sony and Marcel — who also wrote the first two Venom films — are trying to stay in a very specific lane, similar to Madame Web’s.', 'As much as fans might want to see Venom in New York beefing with Spider-Man, that’s just not what this franchise has been building to (yet). These are films about a haggard failson trying to hold his life together with the help of a wise-cracking goo monster who longs for the taste of human brains. And The Last Dance brings Eddie and Venom’s story to a close by confronting them with the consequences of their past adventures.', 'With the government finally realizing how many strange deaths and symbiote incidents he’s connected to, Eddie is on the run somewhere in Mexico as The Last Dance first opens. It seems like there’s nowhere Venom and Eddie can hide without special-ops soldier Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his team finding them. But the duo figure — sort of unreasonably — that they might have a chance of disappearing into the shadows if they can just make it to New York City.', 'Because it’s the culmination of a trilogy, there’s an understandable logic to the fugitive aspects of The Last Dance’s story (which Hardy contributed to). After blowing up a rocket in Venom and creating a new serial killer symbiote in Let There Be Carnage, it makes sense that Eddie and Venom would become high-profile targets forced to go off the grid. But it’s harder to follow the narrative thread being unspooled in The Last Dance’s larger plot about a symbiote invasion. ', 'Much in the same way Let There Be Carnage introduced its Cletus Kasady with a lore-dense info dump, The Last Dance tries its best to explain the whole deal with the symbiote god Knull (Andy Serkis) through a CGI-heavy chunk of exposition pulled from the comics. Knull created the symbiotes, who then betrayed him by trapping him in the center of their homeworld. And after eons of being imprisoned and thinking of ways to punish his parasitic children, Knull suddenly realizes that Eddie and Venom’s unique symbiosis has created the MacGuffin necessary to set him free.', 'There’s an irony to the way The Last Dance cracks a Thanos joke in its opening act and then awkwardly attempts to establish Knull as its own throne-bound big bad. The movie constantly reminds you how scared Venom is of Knull as a way of making its alien villain seem like a threat that has always been lurking out in space. But Knull’s plan — he can send other kinds of monsters through very Doctor Strange-like portals to find things for him — is so contrived that his presence in The Last Dance feels like the result of there not being all that many Venom-related characters Sony holds the cinematic rights to.', 'That “scraping of the bottom of the barrel” quality grows stronger as The Last Dance drops in even more symbiotes whose names are never mentioned but comic fans may recognize because of their color schemes. And while Knull’s alien goons are very cool / terrifying visually, the danger they’re meant to represent feels hollow because the film knows that it can’t exactly afford to kill off its emotional center. ', 'As was the case with the previous films, Hardy’s performances as Eddie and Venom are, depending on how you feel about goofy slapstick comedy, The Last Dance’s biggest strength. While his accent is still shaky as hell, Hardy brings a believable weariness to Eddie this time around that feels right for a man who’s been living with an alien infection for about a year. And Venom is even more subtly emotive in ways that emphasize how much more deeply connected he and Eddie have become during their time together.', 'Even though its plot is weak, its supporting characters are woefully underdeveloped, and its visual effects leave much to be desired, Venom: The Last Dance almost works when it’s just Eddie and Venom getting into shenanigans or reflecting on their life together. That isn’t nearly enough to make for a solid film, but again, solid films have never been the Venom franchise’s forte, and Sony isn’t switching up the formula this late in the game. If you were down to clown with Venom and got a kick out of Let There Be Carnage, The Last Dance will probably keep you mildly entertained. But for folks who could never understand why Sony has been churning these things out, the only real appeal here is that the studio seems to be finished — at least for now.', 'Venom: The Last Dance also stars Juno Temple, Rhys Ifans, Peggy Lu, Clark Backo, Cristo Fernández, and Stephen Graham. The film hits theaters on October 25th.', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'During Tesla’s “We, Robot” event, Elon Musk unveiled the long-awaited prototype robotaxi, Cybercab, which lacks a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.

Venom: The Last Dance Says No to Your MCU Hopes and Dreams,https://www.ign.com/articles/venom-the-last-dance-says-no-to-your-mcu-marvel-hopes-and-dreams,"['Warning: Full spoilers follow for Venom: The Last Dance.', '', ""The eternal irony of the Sony Marvel movies – a.k.a. Sony's Spider-Man Universe – is that in a Hollywood where interconnected superhero worlds are a dominant force, the Spidey spin-offs that make up Sony’s slate really have very little to do with one another. And while most of those films have bigger problems beyond how they do or don’t connect to one another, in the case of the Venom trilogy – the, I suppose, crown jewel of the SSMU? – the lack of connective tissue to Spider-Man’s world has always been glaring."", 'The new and apparently final film in the Venom trilogy, Venom: The Last Dance, doubles-down on the “no Spider-Man” stance. And while there are many possible reasons why there’s never been a Tom Hardy/Tom Holland Venom/Spidey crossover – ranging from creative decisions to legal or contractual ones to maybe even the politics of the relationship between Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios and Sony – the funny thing is, the previous Venom movie and the previous Spider-Man movie each seemed to finally be setting up a connection between the two universes. But that set-up is just hand-waved away in The Last Dance as if to say, “Oh, you fans thought we were gearing up for something big? Nahhhh.”', '2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage featured a post-credits scene where Hardy’s Eddie Brock/Venom was somehow seemingly transported to the MCU. Once there, the bonded pair see on TV that J. Jonah Jameson has revealed Peter Parker’s identity to the world (from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home), and Venom licks the screen right where Spidey’s face is, saying “that guy.” The symbiote was clearly very interested in Peter for some strange reason.', 'Seemed like Sony setting up a face-off to me!', 'Two months later, Spider-Man: No Way Home was released, and in that film’s post-credits scene we saw Eddie/Venom’s very brief trip to the MCU already come to an end. Following directly on the Let There Be Carnage scene, Eddie/Venom is sitting in a bar talking to a bartender (Ted Lasso’s Cristo Fernández) about all the “super people” who live in this universe. “Maybe I should go to New York and speak to this Spider-Man,” he says, before suddenly being magically transported away… but not before leaving the smallest bit of Venom symbiote on the bar.', 'And that seemed like Marvel Studios getting Hardy out of the MCU as fast as they could.', 'It was also the last time we saw Eddie/Venom before The Last Dance, and in fact, they’re still in the MCU at the start of the new film. The above bar scene is even replayed for us, but it’s a condensed version that’s missing some important bits. While the “purple alien who loves stones” is still mentioned in The Last Dance, the other “super people” talk is not, and most notably there’s no mention of… Spider-Man. The line about Eddie/Venom going to New York to find the wallcrawler is also gone. (Venom even makes a crack about being sick of the multiverse before they depart.)', 'The funny thing is, The Last Dance does feature a recurring thread about Hardy’s character(s) wanting to get to New York. Only now it’s not to find Spidey, but rather because the symbiote has always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. One can almost see an earlier draft of the script being about the pair trying to get to Manhattan to find Spider-Man, as was previously set up in not one but two different post-credits scenes, but then the decision being made that, “Eh, we’re going in a different direction.” And who doesn’t want to see Lady Liberty in person, anyway?', 'Fernández’s bartender turns out to have a Venom universe counterpart (you can tell them apart because the Venom world’s guy has long hair!). And indeed, he figures in The Last Dance’s post-credits scene, though it’s unclear what that will really add up to, if anything. Earlier in the film, Eddie/Venom left a small part of the symbiote in the bar, just as they had in the MCU. So perhaps that will lead to some new take on Venom for Sony? But what about the bit of symbiote left behind in the MCU? At the rate that Marvel has ignored post-credits scene revelations in recent years, I wouldn’t be surprised if we just never hear about it again.', 'My colleague Tom Jorgensen (who reviewed Venom: The Last Dance for IGN) pointed out that it would’ve been cool for Eddie to finally make it to New York at the end of the film, only to see the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man swinging across the skyline. Fans have long speculated that the Hardy Venom movies are set in that world. So even if Tom Hardy never made another appearance as Venom, that could’ve been an interesting way to close out his story. His Venom never met Spider-Man, but Spider-Man does exist there after all.', 'But instead, it just feels like Sony has closed the door on the MCU after teasing what could’ve been.', '']"
‘Venom: The Last Dance’: Review,https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/venom-the-last-dance-review/5198431.article,"['BY TIM GRIERSON, SENIOR US CRITIC23 OCTOBER 2024', 'Tom Hardy takes his inner demon out for one final spin in this fun if familiar sequel', '', 'Dir: Kelly Marcel. US. 2024. 109mins ', 'Tom Hardy’s beleaguered journalist and his symbiote best friend go on the run in Venom: The Last Dance, which leans hard on the franchise’s two strengths: its goofy sense of humour and its big heart. Although often characterised as a superhero series with horror elements, the trilogy has mostly played out as an oddball buddy comedy – and this purported final chapter follows that formula to intermittently entertaining effect.', 'This trilogy is probably ending at the right time', 'The Last Dance pits our heroes against their most formidable foe yet — an ancient alien evil that wants to destroy everything in its path — but what works best is the dopey charm of Hardy opposite his CGI sidekick. Their grouchy rapport is almost enough to make up for a slapdash script and some predictable genre elements.', 'Sony unveils The Last Dance in the UK and US on October 25, looking to end the trilogy on a commercial high note. But the 2018 original’s $856 million gross seems out of reach, and initial tracking suggests that the new film may even have trouble matching the $507 million collected by 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Nonetheless, there is no comic-book competition in sight, which should help theatrical prospects. ', 'Eddie (Hardy) is in hiding after the events of Let There Be Carnage with the alien symbiote Venom (voiced by Hardy) still attached to him. But once they learn that authorities are looking to arrest Eddie for a murder he did not commit, the duo decides to get on the road to escape detection. Unbeknownst to the pair, though, a terrifying alien — a sibling of sorts to Venom and his fellow symbiotes — has arrived to find Eddie and Venom, who hold the key to unlocking an unfathomable power.', 'Writer Kelly Marcel, who wrote or co-wrote the previous Venom picture, makes her feature directorial debut here. Not surprisingly, then, The Last Dance feels like a thematic continuation, with the film building toward a finale that is far less open-ended than most blockbusters. There is also a noticeable melancholy that starts to weave through The Last Dance, despite the usual amounts of slapstick silliness and Eddie and Venom’s smart-aleck banter.', 'By now, audiences know what to expect from these two characters, with Eddie eternally frustrated by Venom’s impulsive, violent behaviour, and Hardy again attacks his dual role with comic abandon. But even if Eddie and Venom’s odd-couple shtick has grown familiar, Marcel injects enough surprisingly sweet moments that it’s clear that she and Hardy, who also worked on the story, are invested in this bizarre, unexpectedly touching bromance.', 'Unfortunately, the plot has not enjoyed the same amount of care. The Last Dance is simply the latest superhero flick in which a boringly indestructible enemy seeks to rule the universe, leading to a typically overblown third-act showdown. Likewise, this sequel’s new supporting characters are unoriginal types, including Chiwetel Ejiofor as Strickland, a gruff US general determined to eliminate Eddie and Venom. Juno Temple plays Teddy, a conscientious scientist who believes symbiotes should be studied, not killed. She is saddled with a tritely tragic backstory that is awkwardly shoehorned into the action-packed ending, but the hoped-for emotional wallop never develops.', 'What has made this franchise refreshing is its irreverence, and a refusal to be squeaky-clean family entertainment in the same vein as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. (With Disney owning many of the starriest Marvel properties, Sony has adapted lesser secondary characters it controls, such as Venom, Morbius and Madame Web.) Venom’s rude humour, edgier tone and cartoon-like mayhem were never particularly sophisticated, but Hardy’s madcap gusto gives that film and its sequels a combustible energy. In addition, Eddie’s growing fondness for this uncouth symbiote opened the door to an appealing sentimentality once these two outcasts formed a de facto family. ', 'The Last Dance demonstrates how that mixture of sassy and earnest can be fun, but both the tepid action scenes and mediocre plot twists suggest that this trilogy is probably ending at the right time. The Venom effects are still nicely rendered, but the punchlines are a little shopworn, although this franchise’s penchant for truly bonkers sequences has not diminished. (A dance sequence set in Las Vegas is so superfluous that it’s almost endearing.) Eddie and Venom remain feisty company but, as they hit the road for this final chapter, it is soon apparent that they don’t really have anywhere else to go.

Venom: The Last Dance Is at Odds with Its Acknowledgment of the Void and a Driven Need to Party,https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/venom/venom-the-last-dance-review-tom-hardy-trilogy-ending-mortality-identity,"['From the outset, parsing these Venom movies has been a game of “Go With It.” A film series starring Marvel’s most gnarly Spider-Man foe without Ol’ Web-Head himself? Go with it. When the Venom symbiote chomps on a human head, as he is wont to do, wouldn’t the head go into the stomach of his jittery human host, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy)? Nah, just go with it. And what, exactly, was the deal with Eddie drinking tequila in a Marvel 616 bar during the end credits of Spider-Man: No Way Home? What did we just say?! As the final level in this game of go-along, Venom: The Last Dance is still figuring out what a Venom movie needs to be, a tricky juggling of tone and spectacle that will be amusing enough for those tuned into this series’ squishy, uncomplicated rhythms and a numbing headache for folks bewildered by the chaotic and often rudderless existence of a Venom trilogy.', 'There is something to be admired about how these quasi-superhero movies, directed by Ruben Fleischer, Andy Serkis, and now Kelly Marcel (making her feature debut), jettison the universe-building prickliness that often weighs down other Marvel movies in the name of having a good time. Of the three, Venom (2018) and now Venom: The Last Dance are the most “Marvel-like” in their design, which puts the series’ easygoing vibes at odds with Sony’s fumbling franchise ambitions. (Another Spidey-adjacent villain movie, Kraven the Hunter, is expected to drop on Dec. 13.) The red-headed middle child, Serkis’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), was perhaps the ideal project for the character as he (they) exist in this incarnation: a caustic and bizarre buddy movie with a willingness to wreak havoc at the deliberate expense of nerdy comic book gravitas. V3nom, meanwhile, channels the same frenzied energy as its most immediate predecessor but also has a mind to offer some sobriety to this maybe/maybe not finale, effectively making the third Venom entry feel like two movies in one.', 'The first half is a buddy road flick featuring Eddie and Venom, now fugitives on the lam somewhere in Mexico following the deadly events of Carnage. Their mission, such as it is, is to travel to New York City, where Eddie plans to blackmail a judge to clear his name of the wrongfully brought charges against him (them!). This takes the pair on a squirrelly traipse through the American desert, where they encounter a hippie family (Rhys Ifans, Alanna Ubach, Dash McCloud, and Hala Finley) and make a pit stop in Las Vegas for some neon-soaked shenanigans. (It’s an acceptable excuse for a shameless/harmless cameo and for Hardy to flex a James Bond tux.) The second bit shifts into a foreboding alien invasion movie set in Area 51, where Dr. Payne (Juno Temple) manages a covert lab of lost symbiotes while grizzled soldier Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) hunts Venom on behalf of a shadowy government organization that never truly takes substantial shape.', 'These divergent plotlines, with their own distinct if wildly contrasting moods, eventually collide just before the cacophonous, effects-laden madness that makes up the film’s final stretch, which involves Venom, a multitude of symbiotes, and their Satanic alien creator, Knull.', 'That name will have significance for the comic-reading Spidey-Heads out there. Created by writer Donny Cates and artist Ryan Stegman, confessed acolytes of Venom co-creator Todd McFarlane (with David Michelinie), Knull casts a conspicuous shadow over Venom: The Last Dance. However, his sinister plan—hunting down a cosmic whatsit called “The Codex” that will aid his escape from an eternal prison (nested, inconveniently, inside Venom/Eddie)—feels tacked on to the film’s other concerns. Although Knull (a looming computer-generated fusion of Lovecraft, Giger, and Elric of Melniboné boosted with a bowels-quaking voice), is a notable leveling-up for a movie series that has thus far been inclined to take it easier than what we’ve seen from recent multiverse-threatening MCU entries, his presence remains, for the most part, peripheral.', 'That said, Knull does unleash a screeching, spindly alien monster called the Xenophage that homes in on Eddie and Venom’s Codex signal whenever this ink-blot Hulk takes over his best buddy’s body. (A reasonable conceit that allows Hardy more screen time to flex his action chops.) This development disrupts the boys’ trip to NYC and is the impetus for the movie’s many wild detours—one of note is set atop a soaring airliner—culminating with the bleak suggestion that this bond between our dysfunctional anti-hero duo might be nearing its end.', 'It must be said that the most surprising part of Venom: The Last Dance is its flirtation with mortality, with Hardy’s leathery mug projecting a stoic yearning whenever he and his symbiote friend voice their hopes for a happy ending, should the chips fall that way. That traveling hippie family contributes to this sense of longing Marcel (sharing story credit with Hardy) aims to establish before the alien action pops off, buoyed by a disarmingly sweet car ride singalong to David Bowie’s “A Space Oddity” halfway through the movie. Marcel also bothers to flesh out characters like Payne, Strickland, and a whimsical doctor (Clark Backo), though their function in the wider story is purely mechanical. It’s a laudable attempt to mature the Venom series, even as Venom continues to revel in flapping muscle-tongued hurly-burly and his penchant for cutting a rug whenever the film drops a good beat.', 'This makes one puzzle over what space remains for the Venom character and the gentle beast this post-Endgame superhero bust has freed him to be. Born amid the edgy scuzzlands of Nineties superhero comics, this “lethal protector” and his wily leading man co-star have enjoyed the leeway to discover what kind of gross symbiote head-muncher they want to be in this kinder, more accepting modern sphere. If they should ever cross webs with the amazing Spider-Man, will they meet as enemies, or buds? That last bit probably doesn’t matter. (The jury’s still out on Sony’s function in the MCU; just don’t tell Sony.) Although this enjoyably capricious version of the character doesn’t quite resemble his vicious, violent comic counterpart, there’s a reason why Venom resonates with filmgoers—this spud wants to party and, when it counts, knows how to put on a good one.

Venom: The Last Dance Review: Tom Hardy's Marvel Trilogy Ends With A Whimper,https://www.slashfilm.com/1695477/venom-the-last-dance-tom-hardy-marvel-movie-review/,"['', 'It\'s fair to say that we\'re in the dying days of the superhero movie boom. No, I don\'t mean the superhero movie is going away — it\'s not. Hell, Marvel Studios\' ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" recently became a box office success and audiences seemed to like it, too (although I wasn\'t a fan). But these days, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" feels more like the exception rather than the rule. There was a time there when it seemed like any superhero movie was too big to fail, but after being inundated with a constant barrage of comic book characters brought to digital life, audiences are starting to grow warry. It certainly doesn\'t help that the vast majority of these movies aren\'t very good, either. As a critic, I\'m not really concerned with box office. I have no financial stake in the movie, so whatever it earns opening weekend doesn\'t really interest me. No, what I\'m interested in is quality. How is the movie itself? Does it work? Does it at least entertain? Or does it feel like it\'s wasting my time?', 'After Disney and Marvel teamed up to create the MCU with wildly successful results, other studios wanted in on that sweet superhero action, most notably the folks at Sony. Sony is lucky enough to have the rights to characters from Spider-Man comics, and while the studio struck a deal to bring Spidey into the MCU in the form of Tom Holland, execs got it in their heads that they could make their own movies using Spider-Man-adjacent characters. Aside from the delightful animated ""Spider-Verse"" movies, the results have been dire. Remember ""Morbius""? Of course you don\'t. And this year\'s ""Madame Web"" felt like a punchline before it even hit theaters. ', 'The only luck Sony has had (outside of the ""Spider-Verse"" flicks) has been with Venom, a ""cool"" \'90s Marvel comic character who likes to stick his slimy tongue out. Frequently a villain in the comics, the movies have turned Venom into a hero (who occasionally bites off people\'s heads). These films have been successful at the box office, but what about the quality? The first ""Venom"" is kind of a slog, although it has moments of fun almost entirely due to the weirdo vibes of star Tom Hardy. Hardy is one of our more interesting modern actors, and he\'s able to salvage the first film by doing things like randomly climbing into a lobster tank at a seafood restaurant. The sequel, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" improved on the formula. It leaned into silliness and took things even further by suggesting Hardy\'s character Eddie Brock and the alien symbiote Venom that possesses him are more than just buddies — they\'re in a rom-com relationship. ""Let There Carnage"" seemed to be saying: ""Venom is Eddie Brock\'s boyfriend."" Now here comes ""Venom: The Last Dance,"" the conclusion to this lopsided trilogy. Unfortunately, everything that was fun about ""Let There Be Carnage"" has been jettisoned for a rushed, clumsy, lackluster finale. ', '', 'When we last left Eddie Brock and Venom, they had been sucked into an alternate universe — the MCU, to be exact. But if you thought ""Venom: The Last Dance"" would grapple with this, you\'re wrong: as the film begins, Eddie and Venom are almost instantly thrown back into their own world. There, they find themselves fugitives on the run. Thanks to some clumsy exposition delivered via a news report (a lazy trick the movie uses more than once), Eddie learns he\'s accused of a crime he didn\'t commit, and now he and Venom are trying to make it to New York City to lay low.', ""Meanwhile, we learn about some symbiote experiments going on at a secret science lab known as Area 55. Area 55 is located underneath the famous Area 51, the US Air Force facility that has become synonymous with alien activity in the pop culture zeitgeist. More clumsy news report exposition tells us that Area 51 is about to be shut down, but that doesn't seem to matter, since Area 55 is clearly going strong. The scientists at the lab eventually learn of a new looming threat: Knull, an evil goth alien dude who created all the symbiotes. It's clear that Sony wants to set Knull up as their own version of Thanos, but the character has virtually no real impact here, spending his scant scenes sitting around with his long hair hanging down in his face, looking like a melancholy Hot Topic employee who just got laid off. "", 'Knull is looking for something known as the Codex, a uninteresting Macguffin which has a direct connection to Eddie and Venom. And while Knull is apparently trapped on his gloomy planet, he\'s still able to send forth giant monsters known as Xenophages, and now one of those beasts is on Earth trying to track Eddie and Venom down. I\'m getting bored just typing this, and you\'ll be bored, too. All of this is presented in rather bland, dour fashion, and the enjoyable silliness that was so prevalent in the last movie is almost entirely absent here. There are a few moments of goofy life, like when Venom uses his alien goo to create a Venom horse (and then a Venom fish and a Venom frog), or when Venom has a brief dance number with recurring character Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu), but these are over so quickly they barely register. It\'s as if writer-director Kelly Marcel was handed a studio note that asked, ""Is there any way we can make this movie less fun?""', '', 'If there is one bright spot in ""Venom: The Last Dance,"" it\'s Tom Hardy. Once again doing a questionable voice while vibing on his weirdo energy, Hardy makes Eddie Brock an almost tragic figure; a lonely guy cut off from the rest of the world, with only a wisecracking alien monster for company. He shuffles about like a man uncomfortable in his own skin, looking awkward and aghast. He\'s operating on a different level than this lousy film. Unfortunately, he\'s not getting much backup. ', 'The previous two movies at least had folks like Michelle Williams and Woody Harrelson on hand to take some of the weight off Hardy\'s shoulders. ""The Last Dance"" has talented actors in supporting roles, but they\'re all curiously lacking here. The very skilled Chiwetel Ejiofor is given absolutely nothing to work with as a military man who wants to track Eddie down, and Juno Temple, usually quite good, is surprisingly weak as a scientist who wants to study the symbiotes. She\'s given a clunky backstory about how her twin brother was struck by lightning when they were kids or some such nonsense, but it\'s handled so poorly it might as well not be in the movie at all. Of the supporting cast, only Rhys Ifans has any real impact here, playing an amusing alien-obsessed family man who befriends Eddie along the way. ', 'Don\'t expect much in the way of blockbuster spectacle, either. While ""The Last Dance"" is mercifully short and moves at a clipped speed, the action is filmed in a confusing, ugly manner, with lots of swooping camera movements likely inserted to cover up VFX work. A big climactic fight scene is surely intended to awe, but it does anything but. The end result feels less like a finished film and more like a rough cut that never got around to being finessed. By the time ""Venom: The Last Dance"" tacks on what\'s supposed to be an emotional coda, I found myself itching for the exit. I came out of ""Let There Be Carnage"" wanting more Venom and Eddie. I came out of ""The Last Dance"" content to never see them again.

Venom: The Last Dance is, supposedly, the third and final outing for the classic Spider-Man adversary who, for contractual reasons, has not been allowed to fight any Spider-Men.', 'The Venom trilogy has partly been Sony’s Eminem-soundtracked, oddly vintage attempt to offer a clapback to MCU wholesomeness. Yet, thanks largely to Let There Be Carnage, the trilogy’s 2021 middle chapter, it’s also transformed into a feverishly inspired romcom between Hardy’s moto-jacketed journalist Eddie Brock and Venom, the alien symbiote who latched onto him.', 'The Last Dance, though, sees the franchise unfortunately relapse somewhat into the Morbius and Madame Web brand of dense, dull exposition that Sony’s non-Spider-Man movies seem drawn towards like a moth to a flame.

Two accomplished actors, Ted Lasso’s Juno Temple and Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor, play a scientist and a soldier, respectively – jobs that largely involve peering through observation windows and attempting to fathom the unfathomable.', 'But Marcel, who’s now added director to her usual screenwriter credit, is well aware of what her film is. Any non-Venom scene flies by like it’s being watched from a passing rollercoaster while, crawling out from underneath the pile of studio demands, appears a tribute to Hardy’s blissfully untethered performance as both host and guttural-voiced parasite. What started as the actor dunking his entire body into a restaurant lobster tank here ends with him hunched over a Vegas slot machine, slamming buttons and pulling cranks as if he were being puppeteered off camera.', 'Any scene in The Last Dance that concerns Venom and Eddie is a delight, a direct continuation of the series’s charming, broad-purpose metaphor – queer-coded in parts (they refer to each other as Thelma and Louise), and all about self-love and acceptance. Together, they break up a dog fighting ring and ensure the pups all find “loving forever homes”, a particularly Hardy touch considering his offscreen canine advocacy.', 'They join up with an alien-obsessed camper van family headed by Rhys Ifans, and get roped into a sing-along to David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”. Venom, at one point, fuses himself with a horse, hooves throwing up dust and tongue flapping gracefully wind.

Venom: The Last Dance Retcons Spider-Man: No Way Home Ending,https://www.superherohype.com/news/586304-venom-the-last-dance-retcon-spider-man-no-way-home-ending,"['', 'BY VANSH MEHRA', 'Venom: The Last Dance’s opening follows Eddie Brock’s story after Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, the film changes a few elements from what viewers saw in No Way Home’s post-credits scene. Here’s how Venom: The Last Dance retcons the Symbiote’s previous appearance.', 'In the post-credits scene for Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Venom and Eddie get taken to the MCU’s Earth-616 thanks to Doctor Strange’s botched spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home. But as Doctor Strange tried to make everyone forget about Peter Parker in No Way Home, Eddie and Venom got sent back to their original Earth-688, which is the home of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU).', 'Venom: The Last Dance begins right where Spider-Man: No Way Home ended. However, it changes how Eddie gets pulled back to Earth-688. In No Way Home, Eddie got sent back to the SSU with a glowing white effect. It was similar to how others, including Electro, Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Lizard, Sandman, and the two Spider-Men, were sent back. Even Morbius stayed consistent with this glowing effect while pulling Adrian Toomes / the Vulture from the MCU to the SSU.', 'But in Venom: The Last Dance’s opening, Eddie and Venom get pulled into the SSU through a yellow portal. This portal is similar to the ones that Knull opens for his Xenophages later in the film. This raises the question of whether Knull was involved in pulling Eddie and Venom back. However, this doesn’t seem likely given the plot of the film. If Knull could do that, he’d simply pull Eddie and Venom onto Klyntar to obtain the Codex.', 'So it seems most likely that Eddie was sent back because of Doctor Strange’s spell. Sony only appears to have retconned how he gets transported.', 'Additionally, a sliver of Venom goo was originally left at the bar counter on MCU’s Earth-616. But now, Venom leaves a piece of him in the SSU’s bar instead, which later gets collected by Rex Strickland. Whether this was also meant to be a retcon, or whether Venom left pieces of himself in both the MCU and the SSU, remains to be seen.', 'Vansh is an SEO Contributing Writer for ComingSoon. His passion for cinema and the superhero genre is what turned him into a movie/series analyst. In his spare time, Vansh can be found screaming at his screen while watching cricket matches or binging all sorts of streaming content to brush up on his entertainment knowledge.', 'SHARE ARTICLE']"

That sadly didn’t come to pass, though moviegoers do get to bid adieu to an important character and say hello to a new cosmic supervillain.', '“Venom: The Last Dance” seemingly closed the superhero trilogy starring Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and the title alien symbiote connected to him, a fan-favorite Spider-baddie from the Marvel comic books turned cinematic “lethal protector.” The new movie found Eddie and Venom on a buddy road trip to New York, looking to evade authorities – since Eddie is wanted for murder – as well as snarling outer-space beasts sent by Venom’s creator, the evil Knull (played via motion capture by Andy Serkis). The long-haired blond and brutish god of symbiotes, Knull is locked away on an alien planet, and the bonding of Eddie and Venom is the literal key keeping him from escaping and unleashing a wave of annihilation.', 'Let’s dig into the bittersweet ending, a pair of post-credit scenes, and the odds that this is indeed Eddie and Venom’s last dance.', ""Join our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox."", 'Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', 'On the way from the Bay Area to the Big Apple and after a wild stop in Las Vegas, Eddie and Venom wind up at Area 51, where the government has been housing and studying other alien symbiotes. Knull’s violent creatures battle Venom and the symbiotes (who find human hosts in the rando scientists around), and Venom ultimately sacrifices himself to save the day. He disengages from Eddie and forms a web around the vicious beasts, which allows military man Rex Strickland (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to shower Venom with a liquid that dissolves the creatures but also our alien hero. (But not before he shares a final moment with Eddie.)', 'Eddie gets pardoned by the government and finally makes it to New York, where he takes in the Statue of Liberty – a landmark Venom really wanted to visit. “I won’t forget you, buddy,” he says.', 'It actually has two – one significant, the other cryptic. After the first wave of credits roll, we see an extra scene featuring Knull in close-up for a villainous rant. “The King in Black is awake,” he says, a reference to the Marvel Comics story line that featured Knull setting his sights on Earth. “I will kill your world. Everyone will burn and you will watch.” It’s not targeting anyone specifically but given that he’s a Thanos-level threat in the comics, it’s probably not great for the universe at large.', 'The other extra scene is at the very end following the last credits. It shows a cave in a wasteland where out comes a confused bartender played by Cristo Fernández (from “Ted Lasso”) that Eddie and Venom interacted with when they spent a little time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Hello?!” he shouts across a large swath of nothing as he begins to walk. The camera closes in on a nearby cockroach skittering by a shattered test tube − and it looks an awful lot like the one crushed by scientist Teddy Payne (played by Juno Temple) that unleashed a symbiote and turned her into a Venomized speedster.', 'So what does that all mean? Unclear. The locale resembles the Void, a purgatorial place that exists between the various universes as seen in “Loki” and most recently “Deadpool & Wolverine.” It could be a sign that symbiotes will play a role in future movies, the bartender might be getting a new alien friend, or, while Venom might be gone, the symbiote now in Teddy still survives.', 'Considering the Knull of it all, probably not. The post-credit scenes in Sony’s Marvel movies haven’t led to much – and given the bad feelings for both “Morbius” and “Madame Web,” probably won’t in the long run. But playing the Knull card means someone’s got plans for him, in some universe, and if he’s around, symbiotes will follow.', 'Moviegoers could see the return of Venom (and Knull) as early as the next “Spider-Man” film, which begins filming next summer with Tom Holland back as the web-slinging young hero. (The concept of the movie – directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and slated for release July 24, 2026 – is ""crazy,"" Holland reports.) Maybe Eddie meets up with Peter Parker in New York City, Venom somehow comes along for the ride, and a dynamic duo becomes a terrific threesome.']"

More concerning, though, was the drop off from the first two “Venom” films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2 million, while the 2021 follow-up, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” opened with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the pandemic.', '“The Last Dance,” starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most comic-book films.', 'But “The Last Dance” is also performing better overseas. Internationally, “Venom: The Last Dance” collected $124 million over the weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China. That’s good enough for one of the best international weekends of the year for a Hollywood release.', 'Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience scores (a franchise-low “B-” CinemaScore) have been good for the film scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel.', 'The low weekend for “Venom: The Last Dance” also likely insures that superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years, not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.', 'Following on the heels of the “Joker: Folie à Deux” flop, Gross estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel’s “Kraven the Hunter,” due out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the genre hasn’t, overall, been dominating the way it once did.
