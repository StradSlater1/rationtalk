The Egyptian proposal calls for the release of just six Israeli hostages in exchange, the official said. It was suggested by Hassan Mahmoud Rashad, the new head of Egyptian intelligence, who took up his post last week. ', 'The proposal was first reported by Axios.', 'Blinken arrived in Israel early Tuesday as part of a Middle East tour aimed at renewing talks for a comprehensive deal to end the intensifying regional conflict after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.', ""It comes as Israel continues to mount a deadly offensive in northern Gaza, where thousands of people have fled intense Israeli operations in areas like the Jabalia refugee camp in recent days. Israeli forces also continued their invasion of southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah on Tuesday while striking parts of the country's capital, Beirut, in an assault that sparked the evacuation of a local hospital."", '“The thinking is that efforts at a big deal kept meeting challenges. So the idea is to get the momentum going with a smaller deal,” the Israeli official said. The official cautioned that while the proposal has been discussed by Israeli leaders, it has not been approved.', 'It’s also unclear if Hamas would be open to a smaller agreement.', ""While the U.S. is hopeful that the killing of the militant group's hard-line leader last week could create an opportunity for negotiations, a U.S. official acknowledged that Washington does not know who — if anyone — is currently in charge of Hamas and could negotiate on its behalf."", 'Asked about the Egyptian proposal, a U.S. official told NBC News: “Who are you going to negotiate with? Hamas has to decide on its next leader.”', 'Later, Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed the need to chart ""a new path forward in the post-conflict period that allows Palestinians to rebuild their lives and provides governance, security, and reconstruction for Gaza,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.', '""The Secretary emphasized the need for Israel to take additional steps to increase and sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and ensure that assistance reaches civilians throughout Gaza,"" the statement added.

', '“There were no weapons, there were no bullets, there were no missiles, you looked and saw and searched,” said Mohammad Al Maqdad, who said he lost at least 20 members of his family in the strike. “Was there a missile here?”   ', 'The only weapons here, he said, came from Israel and America. ', 'Officials at another hospital in Dahieh, which is known as a Hezbollah stronghold, told NBC News they had evacuated the medical facility after Israel claimed a Hezbollah cash bunker was under the site.', 'The Israeli military alleged that Hezbollah has hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold stashed in a bunker built under the Sahel General Hospital, a charge the facility’s director denied.', 'The Israel Defense Forces said it would not attack the hospital directly, but the medical facility’s director, Dr. Fadi Alami, told NBC News that officials still moved to evacuate the hospital.', 'He said they hoped to be able to return patients to the facility by late Tuesday morning as he dismissed the Israeli military’s allegations.', '“We completely deny the enemy allegations,” he said. “They’re dreaming. This whole thing is theater.”', 'At least 13 people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli strike nearby Monday night that also caused damage to the Rafik Hariri University Hospital in southern Beirut, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said that overnight it had struck “Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centers, and additional terror targets in Beirut.”', ""About 150 miles south in Jerusalem, the U.S.' top diplomat renewed efforts to calm the fighting in the spiraling conflict. A senior State Department official told NBC News, which is traveling with Blinken, that he had five major goals on his trip to the region."", 'At the top of his list of priorities was discussing with Israel how to bring an end to the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain there, the official said. Blinken’s immediate focus is also on pressing Israel to get more food and other aid into northern Gaza where there is a growing hunger crisis, the official said.', 'He will also look to discuss a postwar plan for the Palestinian enclave and to drill down on the humanitarian steps Israel must take to relieve widespread suffering its yearlong military offensive has caused in the Gaza Strip.', 'Blinken will look to push forward talks on how to secure a diplomatic solution to the fighting in Lebanon and to discuss with Israeli officials their expected response to a strike launched by Iran in retaliation for the assassinations of top Hamas and Hezbollah commanders.', ""The secretary of state will also discuss the use of an advanced anti-missile system sent by the U.S. to Israel to fortify the country's already robust missile defense program, which was put in place this week."", 'It comes as the U.S. investigates an apparent leak of top-secret documents showing U.S. spy agencies tracking possible Israeli preparations for the strike against Iran.', 'Raf Sanchez reported from Tel Aviv, Andrea Mitchell from Jerusalem, Matt Bradley and Ziad Jaber from Beirut and Chantal Da Silva from London.', 'Raf Sanchez is a foreign correspondent for NBC News.', 'Andrea Mitchell is chief Washington correspondent and chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.', 'Matt Bradley is a London-based foreign correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC.', 'Ziad Jaber is a London-based producer for NBC News.', 'Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London.', '© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '']"

"CIA, Mossad chiefs to meet with Qatar PM for Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations: Official",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2576967/middle-east,"['https://arab.news/5naye', 'DOHA: The directors of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad will meet Qatar’s prime minister in Doha on Sunday to begin negotiations for a new short term Gaza ceasefire deal and the release of some hostages by Hamas in exchange for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the talks told Reuters.\nThe talks aim to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza that would last less than a month, with the hope that it would lead to a more permanent agreement, the official said. The details of which or how many hostages and prisoners would be released as part of the deal is not yet clear, the official said.', 'TEHRAN: Iranian officials should determine how best to demonstrate Iran’s power to Israel after the Israeli attack on Iran two nights ago, Iran’s official IRNA news agency cited the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying on Sunday.\n“The evil committed by the Zionist regime (Israel) two nights ago should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated,” IRNA cited Khamenei as saying.\nIran on Saturday played down Israel’s overnight air attack against Iranian military targets, saying it caused only limited damage, as US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation that has raised fears of an all-out conflagration in the Middle East.\nScores of Israeli jets completed three waves of strikes before dawn against missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran, Israel’s military said.\nKhamenei said Iran’s power should be demonstrated to Israel, adding that the way to do so should be “determined by the officials and that which is in the best interest of the people and the country should take place.”', 'JERUSALEM: A truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop in central Israel Sunday, injuring at least 24 people before he was “shot and neutralized,” police said.\nPreliminary police findings showed the driver also hit a bus that had stopped at the same location to drop off passengers, the police said in a statement.\nAt least 24 people were injured in the incident, police said, without clarifying whether it was an attack.\nThe force however said civilians at the site of the incident “shot the truck driver and neutralized him.”\nEarlier on Sunday the Magen David Adom emergency service said the incident occurred at Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat HaSharon, north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv.\nOf those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement.\nOfficers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where Israeli television channels showed police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above.\nThe incident comes as Israel holds ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon.', 'TEL AVIV: Iran’s military issued a carefully worded statement Saturday night suggesting a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon trumps any retaliation against Israel.\nWhile saying it had the right to retaliate, the statement suggested Tehran may be trying to find a way to avoid further escalation after Israel’s attack early Saturday.\nIran’s military added that Israel used so-called “stand-off” missiles over Iraqi airspace to launch its attacks and that the warheads were much lighter in order to travel the distance to the targets they struck in three provinces in Iran.\nThe statement said Iranian military radar sites had been damaged, but some already were under repair.\nIsrael attacked military targets in Iran with pre-dawn airstrikes Saturday in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired on Israel earlier this month. The strikes marked the first time Israel’s military has openly attacked Iran.\nFollowing the airstrikes, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said it had a right to self-defense, and “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend against foreign acts of aggression.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran has “no limits” in defending its interests.\nIsrael’s military said it targeted facilities that Iran used to make the missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or nuclear sites were hit, which would have marked a much more serious escalation.\nIran’s state-run IRNA news agency said four people were killed, all with the country’s military air defense. It did not say where they were stationed. Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces, without elaborating. The Islamic Republic said the attacks caused “limited damage.”\nThe strikes risk pushing the archenemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiraling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel.\nUS President Joe Biden told reporters Israel gave him a heads-up before the strikes and said it looked like “they didn’t hit anything but military targets.” He said he had just finished a call with intelligence officials.\n“I hope this is the end,” he said.\nIsrael’s first open attack on Iran\nIran hadn’t faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. Explosions could be heard in Tehran until sunrise.\nOn Oct. 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel in retaliation for devastating blows Israel landed against Hezbollah. They caused minimal damage and a few injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran “made a big mistake.”\nIsrael is also widely thought to be behind a limited airstrike in April near a major air base in Iran that hit the radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery. Iran had fired a wave of missiles and drones at Israel in April, causing minimal damage, after two Iranian generals were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria.\n“Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,” Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. He added: “If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.”\nImages released by Israel’s military showed members preparing to depart for the strikes in American-made F-15 and F-16 warplanes.\nIsrael’s attack did not take out highly visible or symbolic facilities that could prompt a significant response from Iran, said Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at Tel Aviv’s Institute for National Security Studies who formerly worked for Israel’s National Security Council.\nIt also gives Israel room for escalation if needed, and targeting air defense systems weakens Iran’s capabilities to defend against future attacks, he said, adding that if there is Iranian retaliation, it should be limited.\nIsrael has again shown its military precision and capabilities are superior to Iran’s, said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n“By targeting military sites and missile facilities over nuclear and energy infrastructure, Israel is also messaging that it seeks no further escalation for now,” Vakil said. “This is a sign that the diplomacy and back-channel efforts to moderate the strike were successful.”\nBiden’s administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit nuclear facilities and oil installations.\nAfter the strikes, the streets in Iran’s capital were calm and children went to school and shops opened. There were long lines at the gas stations — a regular occurrence in Tehran when military violence flares as people stock up on fuel. But some Tehran residents seemed anxious and avoided conversations with an Associated Press reporter.\nMixed reactions at home and abroad\nIsrael’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, criticized the decision to avoid “strategic and economic targets,” saying on X that “we could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran.”\nThe United States warned against further retaliation, and Britain and Germany said Iran should not respond. “All acts of escalation are condemnable and must stop,” the spokesman for the UN secretary-general said.\nSaudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran’s “sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.”\nBoth Hezbollah and Hamas condemned Israel’s attack, with Hezbollah saying it would not affect Tehran’s support for Lebanese and Palestinians fighting Israel.\nRegional tensions have been soaring in recent weeks.\nIn Lebanon, dozens were killed and thousands wounded in September when pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded in attacks attributed to Israel. A massive Israel airstrike the following week outside Beirut killed Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\nIsrael launched a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. More than a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and the death toll has risen sharply as airstrikes hit in and around Beirut.\nEnemies for decades\nIsrael and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear program.\nDuring their yearslong shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged.\nMeanwhile, Iran has been blamed for attacks on shipping in the Middle East, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor.\nThe shadow war has increasingly moved into the light since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other militants attacked Israel. They killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a devastating air and ground offensive against Hamas, and Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until all hostages are freed. Some 100 remain, about a third believed to be dead.\nMore than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in largely devastated Gaza, according to local health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say more than half have been women and children.', 'TEHRAN: An American researcher said an Israeli airstrike on Saturday hit a building that was part of Iran’s defunct nuclear weapons development program, and he and another researcher said facilities used to mix solid fuel for missiles also were struck.\nThe assessments based on commercial satellite imagery were reached separately by David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, and Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a Washington think tank.\nThey told Reuters that Israel struck buildings in Parchin, a massive military complex near Tehran. Israel also hit Khojir, according to Eveleth, a sprawling missile production site near Tehran.\nReuters reported in July that Khojir was undergoing massive expansion.\nEveleth said the Israeli strikes may have “significantly hampered Iran’s ability to mass produce missiles.”\nThe Israeli military said three waves of Israeli jets struck missile factories and other sites near Tehran and in western Iran early on Saturday in retaliation for Tehran’s Oct. 1 barrage of more than 200 missiles against Israel.\nIran’s military said the Israeli warplanes used “very light warheads” to strike border radar systems in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran.\nIn posts on X, Albright said commercial satellite imagery showed that Israel hit a building in Parchin called Taleghan 2 that was used for testing activities during the Amad Plan, Iran’s defunct nuclear weapons development program.\nThe UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and US intelligence say Iran shuttered the program in 2003. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons.\nAlbright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security research group, was given access to the program’s files for a book after they were stolen from Tehran by Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency in 2018.\nOn X, he said the archives revealed that Iran kept important test equipment in Taleghan 2.\nIran may have removed key materials before the airstrike, he said, but “even if no equipment remained inside” the building would have provided “intrinsic value” for future nuclear weapons-related activities.\nAlbright told Reuters that commercial satellite imagery of Parchin showed Israel damaged three buildings about 350 yards (320 m) from Taleghan 2, including two in which solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed.\nHe did not identify the commercial firm from which he obtained the images.\nEveleth said an image of Parchin from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, showed that Israel destroyed three ballistic missile solid fuel mixing buildings and a warehouse in the sprawling complex.\nPlanet Labs imagery also showed that an Israeli strike destroyed two buildings in the Khojir complex where solid fuel for ballistic missiles was mixed, he said.\nThe buildings were enclosed by high dirt berms, according to the image reviewed by Reuters. Such structures are associated with missile production and are designed to stop a blast in one building from detonating combustible materials in nearby structures.\n“Israel says they targeted buildings housing solid-fuel mixers,” Eveleth said. “These industrial mixers are hard to make and export-controlled. Iran imported many over the years at great expense, and will likely have a hard time replacing them.”\nWith a limited operation, he said, Israel may have struck a significant blow against Iran’s ability to mass-produce missiles and made it more difficult for any future Iranian missile attack to pierce Israel’s missile defenses.\n“The strikes appear to be highly accurate,” he said.\nAxios reported that Israel destroyed hit 12 “planetary mixers” used to produce solid fuel for long-range ballistic missiles, quoting three unnamed Israeli sources as saying this severely damages Iran’s ability to renew its missile stockpile and could deter Iran from further massive missile strikes against Israel.\nIran has the Middle East’s largest missile arsenal and supplied missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, and to Yemen’s Houthi rebels and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to US officials.\nTehran and Moscow deny that Russia has received Iranian missiles.\nPlanet Labs imagery reviewed earlier this year by Eveleth and Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey showed major expansions at Khojir and the Modarres military complex near Tehran that the pair assessed were for boosting missile production, Reuters reported.\nThree senior Iranian officials confirmed that conclusion.', 'BEIRUT, Lebanon: Lebanon’s state news agency on Sunday reported an Israeli raid on southern Beirut, after Israel’s army issued a fresh evacuation call.\nThe official National News Agency said shortly after midnight that Israel had “targeted the southern suburbs of Beirut.”', 'The Israeli military on Sunday said four soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon, bringing to 36 the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since the start of ground operations on September 30.\nThe soldiers “fell during combat in southern Lebanon,” the army said in a statement, adding that they were killed on Saturday.\nThe Israeli army had earlier urged residents of two neighborhoods in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital to evacuate their homes.\n“You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will operate in the near future,” military spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on social media platform X, using an acronym for the Israeli army.\nThe evacuation call included maps showing buildings that would be targeted in Burj Al-Barajneh and Hadath.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"
