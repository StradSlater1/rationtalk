Singer’s National Anthem disaster goes viral highlighting Free & Equal Presidential Debate,https://www.ktalnews.com/news/national/what-is-free-and-equal-elections-foundation-debate-presidential-third-party/,"['KTALnews.com', '', '', '', '', '', 'by: Marlo Lacen', 'Posted: Oct 27, 2024 / 04:03 PM CDT', 'Updated: Oct 27, 2024 / 04:03 PM CDT', '', '', '', 'SHREVEPORT, La. (KTAL/KMSS)—On Wednesday, three presidential hopefuls participated in a debate that you might not have known about unless you’re really into third-party voting or you caught a viral moment that left you wondering what the Free & Equal Presidential Debate is.', 'The Free & Equal Elections Foundation hosted the debate on October 23, 2024, in Los Angeles. Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Libertarian Chase Oliver, and Constitution Party presidential hopeful Randall Terry were present for the debate, which was moderated by Free & Equal Founder Christina Tobin and former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and simulcast across multiple platforms, including C-Span.', 'Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the country’s major party candidates, were invited, as were Dr. Cornel West and Claudia De La Cruz. None of those mentioned above were present.', 'In complete transparency – if not for a now-viral clip, this debate would not have been on the radar as our two-party and very costly system doesn’t allow third-party candidates to benefit from media time or exposure. However, an eyebrow-raising rendition of the National Anthem paired with the f-bomb that followed as singer Loomis asked for a re-do to find the song’s lyrics and pitch led to a chain of events, including the writing of this article.', 'If you can get beyond the unconventional nature of the debate – performances before questions –you will find that the two-party system is a stumbling block for democracy. While Stein, Oliver, or Terry will not dent the number of votes that Harris-Walz or Trump-Vance will surely secure on November 5, they have ideas that would benefit the country. The ideals expressed by all three candidates are reminiscent of a time in American politics when people with differing opinions could debate without hate. Or debate without constant fact-checking because you could trust that a meme was not the prime source of information being cited.', 'As far apart as likely winners Harris or Trump are on the issues, Stein, Terry, and Oliver offer even more variety for voters seeking to afford groceries, a home, and a quality of life that was once believed to be a given if you worked hard. Even as the economy and stock market thrive, consumer prices are still very high.', 'Watching the debate reminds you that, as a nation, we are not as far from civil discourse as one might think. The loudest and most obnoxious speakers monopolize attention because Americans love a spectacle. However, those on the Free and Equal debate stage came across as reasonable people with ideas that were not much unlike those of the people you know. Stein and Oliver expressed concern about corporatizing everything—albeit in very different ways and with starkly different solutions. If the problems are similar, common ground can be reached for a resolution.', 'Terry reminded voters that the laws of Moses and the teachings of Jesus are the basic foundation of human existence – he then called abortion murder. He said his administration would return the procedure to “the depths of hell.” While the majority of Americans do not agree with a national abortion ban, voters guided by their faith and religious practices could find common ground with him without feeling like they are compromising their faith in other ways.', 'Sometimes, a viral moment can make you feel like you traded several brain cells in exchange for viewing; other times, you learn something. In the case of Loomis, a singer I’d never heard of requesting a National Anthem do-over by dropping the f-bomb at a debate I had no clue was happening – I’m grateful. This is a democracy, and democracy doesn’t require big dollars or celebrity appearances.', 'Despite the extreme financial requirements of seeking state and national offices, citizens who love this country and want to see it thrive and evolve – continue to run. People like Stein, Oliver, and Terry, who know they don’t stand a snowball’s chance in a hot place, continue to participate in the process and help shape the views and priorities of the major parties through their candidacy.', 'So that leaves you, the voter, to decide what you want and how you want to shape the future where you live. Whether you vote with your conscience, wallet, heart, or bible – please do not skip the responsibility to vote because those potholes along your ride home aren’t repaired by complaining to your neighbor over yardwork.', 'Early voting is underway in most states.
