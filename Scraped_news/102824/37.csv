"Apple Intelligence launches this week. How to get it, and what you can do with it",https://www.fastcompany.com/91214305/apple-intelligence-launch-iphone-ios-18-siri-ai-photo-summary-proofread,"['LOGIN', '10-26-2024\nTECH', 'When Apple Intelligence debuts on select devices this week. you’ll be able to do things you could never do before. Here’s what to expect.', '[Photos: Apple]', 'BY MICHAEL GROTHAUS\n4 MINUTE READ', 'After months of anticipation, Apple’s official foray into the world of artificial intelligence launches this week. That’s when the company will roll out its Apple Intelligence AI platform to eligible devices. Apple isn’t being shy about how profound of an event this will be for the company and its future. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Intelligence would make the experience of using Apple products “profoundly different” and likened Apple’s AI technology to the iPhone’s touch interface and the iPod’s click wheel in terms of innovation and importance.', 'That’s a high bar—and possibly a problematic one. That’s because the Apple Intelligence that gets rolled out this week won’t be a finished product but rather a work in progress. All of the Apple Intelligence features the company previewed in June won’t be coming to your iPhone or other devices just yet. So, what features are coming this week? Here’s what you need to know.', 'When Apple Intelligence launches this week, it will include a swath of new AI features baked into the iPhone’s operating system—iOS 18.1 (Apple Intelligence is also coming to supported iPads and Macs this week). These features can be broken down into four main categories, according to the release notes (published by 9to5Mac). They are:', 'In addition to the above Apple Intelligence features, others launching this week include the ability to use auto-generated, contextually relevant smart replies so you can quickly respond to emails and text messages with a tap, and the ability to generate a text-based summary of audio recordings, which saves you the time of having to listen to the entire recording.', 'While many people will find the above features useful, they are, unfortunately, just a handful of the ones Apple promised when the company first previewed Apple Intelligence in June. Most of the headline-prompting, eye-catching features of Apple Intelligence are still months away—with some likely not making an appearance until 2025.', 'For example, Image Playground, the name Apple gives to Apple Intelligence’s ability to generate images in the style of sketches and illustrations that can be used in messages, presentations, and documents, is nowhere to be seen in Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1. Neither is what is perhaps the most fun feature—Genmoji—which allows users to create custom emojis. Both these features are rumored to not be arriving until iOS 18.2 is released in December, according to Bloomberg.', 'But other features of Apple Intelligence are even further away. The most powerful features of Apple Intelligence likely won’t arrive until iOS 18.4, which isn’t expected until Spring of 2025, at the earliest. Bloomberg says that’s when Apple Intelligence will finally gain the ability to understand context and allow Siri to control apps and “see” what is currently on users’ iPhone screen to help them complete tasks. These features will let Siri help you edit a photo and then send it to your friend—all you have to do is ask.', 'ABOUT THE AUTHOR', 'Michael Grothaus is a novelist and author.

Siri’s big ChatGPT upgrade is here — for better and worse,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278716/siri-chat-gpt-ios-18-2-developer-beta-apple-intelligence,"['By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.', 'Apple Intelligence’s official launch is less than a week away, but it’s the next wave of AI updates that will start to make Siri a lot more useful.', 'The forthcoming iOS 18.2 update — now available as a developer beta — starts to make your phone a lot smarter with the addition of Visual Intelligence and the ability to pass Siri requests along to ChatGPT. On phones that support Apple Intelligence, Siri won’t just be a “let me Google that for you” machine; now it’s a “let me ChatGPT that for you” machine, with all that entails: good, bad, and everything in between.', 'By default, Siri will ask for confirmation every time it wants to pass on a request to ChatGPT. This makes a lot of sense, and I thought I’d prefer that behavior. But after an afternoon using it, I realized I just wanted to get to the ChatGPT answer faster and turned it off. Siri still handles basic questions on its own and doesn’t pass things like “When is the US election?” to ChatGPT, thankfully. And it will still just Google something for you when that’s the best way to get to your answer.', 'But more complex stuff goes to ChatGPT, which means Siri can handle a lot more stuff than I’m used to throwing at it. Ask it “What are some cocktails I can make with whiskey and lemon juice?” and you’ll get a short list of options with descriptions. Old Siri will basically just show you a Google search snippet.', 'AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini regularly get things wrong and make things up. But I’ve started using them more and more as a starting point when I need help with something and I’m basically clueless. I actually downloaded Gemini (by way of Google’s iOS app) to the iPhone 16 I’ve been using because I got tired of opening it in a browser. As long as you don’t blindly trust what the AI tells you, it’s a handy way to get pointed in the right direction.', 'Apple has put some nice privacy protections around your use of ChatGPT. OpenAI is “required to process your request solely for the purpose of fulfilling it and does not store your request or any responses it provides,” Apple states. The information won’t be used to train AI models, either. If you sign in to your OpenAI account, your requests are saved in your ChatGPT history and all of OpenAI’s terms apply. But you don’t need an OpenAI account at all if you don’t want or have one. I appreciate that.', 'A glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens', 'iPhone 16 owners will have another way to tap into ChatGPT’s smarts, too: Visual Intelligence, which is also enabled in 18.2. It’s accessed by holding down the camera control button, which pulls up a camera live view. Once you take a photo, you can have ChatGPT analyze it or use Google Image search to find similar results on the web. It is a glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens, and it’s about time iPhones had something like this built in. Siri could previously look up plants and landmarks and the like, but nothing as expansive as this.', 'Visual Intelligence is pretty good — mostly. It was very flattering in its descriptions of various spots around my house, calling my entryway “cozy” and “well-organized,” and our whiskey collection “impressive.” It came up with a decent list of cocktails to make based on a picture of my home bar, and it got me started in the right direction on a home repair with a picture of the problem. As long as you treat the answer as a starting point, AI is pretty handy for these kinds of low stakes questions.', 'But all of the familiar pitfalls of AI chatbots are present, which Apple warns you about in every interaction you have with ChatGPT. I asked it to explain the joke in a Garfield comic strip to me, and it completely made up details that weren’t there (though to be fair, the joke it invented was funnier than the actual source material). I asked it about the books on my shelf and it hallucinated some titles that are definitely not on that shelf.', 'I also wish that ChatGPT would let you check its work the way that Gemini does. Google’s AI chatbot supplies obvious links to articles on the topics it references, so you know where to go to read more and double check what the AI is telling you. ChatGPT mentions in small print the number of sources it pulled from to come up with your answer for Siri, and you need to tap to see links to those articles.', 'Still, it’s a leap forward in the kinds of things you can expect Siri to do. And it’s one that people won’t see when they download Apple Intelligence; in iOS 18.1, Siri gets a new look with a glowing border, a new text interface, and improved language understanding. But it’s basically the same old Siri.', 'That starts to change in 18.2, and Apple’s AI ambitions are bigger still than “go ask ChatGPT.” Eventually, Siri will be able to take action for you in apps — kind of the whole promise of AI on our phones. But those kinds of updates likely won’t arrive until well into 2025.', 'Of all the Apple Intelligence features I’ve used so far, the ChatGPT integration feels like the one I’ll use the most; the same way that Gemini has me using Google’s assistant more often for more things. It’s not always right, but as a tool to help me get to the right answer, it’s pretty smart.', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'Kylie Robison joins the show to talk about OpenAI’s new model, o1, and what this new “reasoning” model says about the state of the art in AI — and what AI companies are willing to put up with in the name of building God. Then, Gaby Del Valle and Adi Robertson talk through the latest on the TikTok ban, the Trump crypto chaos, and the ongoing adtech antitrust trial against Google.

The one obvious issue? Unlike hearing aids, wearing AirPods while talking to someone might look like you're not engaging or ignoring them. But, if it helps, then it's worth it. The update could also make a big difference in access for individuals with hearing loss. Hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars, while the AirPods Pro 2 are $249 (not nothing, but much better in comparison)."", 'Apple Intelligence is the other major feature coming through iOS 18.1.

We already knew it was some time in October and now Apple has said it will be next week. And on Wednesday, Oct. 23, Apple has just put the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 live.', 'Apple Intelligence is just days away.', 'Although the iOS 18.1 release is highly anticipated, it’s the developer beta of iOS 18.2—set to be the next update unless there are bug fixes that are needed in the meantime—that will likely cause more excitement as it has a lot of new features.', 'PROMOTED', 'Early adopters of the new software have already commented on features they like. John-Anthony Disotto at Techradar, for instance, has talked about the AI features coming to the Mail app, saying, “While it may not be as headline-grabbing as ChatGPT-integration with Siri, Visual Intelligence, or Genmoji, it’s the mundane use of AI that I think the average consumer will appreciate most. I’ve been using the new Mail app in iOS 18.2 developer beta for roughly 24 hours now, and while it’s still in development it makes me optimistic about Apple Intelligence.”', 'Disotto’s enthusiasm is because of strong summarizing tools, new categorization and an improved design. Together they have sorted out what was a “mess of an inbox.” He also warns that as this is a developer beta, that it shouldn’t be installed on your main driver. I’d agree, early betas can be unstable or can damage battery life.', 'Forbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.', '', '', '', 'While he’s unsure how often he’ll use the summarization tools, he was impressed by how many details it picked up when sorting through a chain of seven messages.', 'As discussed below, this Mail feature is just one of many new capabilities coming later this year. These include Visual Intelligence which works with the Camera Control on the iPhone 16 series phones. Pressing and holding on the button means the iPhone will share extra information about what the camera can see, or translate a sign, recognize an address or phone number and more. Apple has said that the iPhone 16 was the first to be designed from the ground up for Apple Intelligence, and this is an example of exactly that.', 'While the updates coming in iOS 18.1 are exciting, it looks like iOS 18.2 will be the big one in terms of Apple Intelligence highlights. As well as the details listed below, this update will also have Image Wand, which uses image generation tools to create an image in a note in the Notes app, for instance. If you’ve drawn something with the Apple Pencil on an iPad, for instance, it can turn a rough sketch into a nicer image.', 'There are also new details which have come to light of a key element of Apple Intelligence: there’s a waitlist. When you update to iOS 18.1, the Settings app includes a new extra called Apple Intelligence & Siri. It’s here that you can sign up to Apple Intelligence. When you do, you’ll be asked to join a waitlist, exactly as those using the developer or public betas have had to do.', 'During that time, the waitlist moved fast: I waited for all of 10 minutes. That may change when the software hits the critical mass that the general release brings with it. However, if you’ve already used Apple Intelligence in beta, Apple has said you don’t need to wait again.', 'So, as Ryan Christoffel points out at 9to5Mac, this is a cunning way to beat the waitlist. “You can join the Apple Intelligence waitlist today. How? By installing the iOS 18.1 public beta. Apple just released the iOS 18.1 RC beta today. RC stands for release candidate, meaning the software will likely be identical to what’s released to all users next week… once you install the iOS 18.1 RC, you’ll be able to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist without waiting another day.” Which means that you can then switch to the general release software next week but you won’t have to join a waitlist again.', 'Next week means Monday, Oct. 28, Tuesday, Oct. 29 or Wednesday, Oct. 30. My belief is that the exact release details will be 10 a.m. Pacific on Oct. 28.', 'The first features of Apple’s personal intelligence system are almost here. There’s more to come over the next few months but initial features include writing tools to let you improve what you’ve written. You can proofread your text, and the iPhone can rewrite or summarize what you’ve said. These tools are available across the iPhone, including in Mail, Notes, Pages and in some third-party apps.', '', 'Photos has a new clean-up tool which can remove people and things spoiling your shot, and uses multiple machine learning tools to leave the background pristine, like they were never there.', 'You can already record and transcribe audio, but with iOS 18.1, the capability to record phone calls is added, complete with automatic notifications to participants. A summary is also generated after the call ends.', 'Siri gains a new design that looks somehow more central to the iPhone experience and will offer a more intuitive interaction.', 'At first, Apple Intelligence on iPhone will only work with devices with language and Siri set to U.S. English. But Apple has now released a developer beta which will extend this to other versions of English.', 'The new dev beta of iOS 18.2 has just gone live and it allows more English speakers to use Apple Intelligence, specifically English for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the U.K.', 'It also introduces a lot more features, plus refinements to the existing writing tools—you can specify what you’re looking for with a “Describe your change” element.', 'New features include Image Playground, which lets you create images from a picture in your photo library. You can save these to a new standalone app which will update automatically across devices on the same Apple account.', 'And iOS 18.2 sees the arrival of the much-anticipated Genmoji to create all-new emoji with just a text prompt. There’s also the first sight of integration with ChatGPT. If Siri thinks ChatGPT could help, it’ll ask if you’d like to be connected to it. Apple has stressed the security protections it has put in place for each request and no ChatGPT account is needed.

Apple iPhone 16 review: It’s the most “Pro” standard iPhone to date,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-reviews/tech/a62706354/apple-iphone-16-review/,"['We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.', 'Almost everything I love about the Pro is now more affordable', 'Apple made a big change for this year by launching new features on its latest “standard” iPhone model rather than only on its Pro handset. Even if you haven’t realised it, the features that tend to come to each new iPhone are usually the ones launched in the “Pro” phone of the previous year. For the iPhone 16, though, I’m happy to report that’s no longer true.', 'The iPhone 16 picks up a brand-new A18 chip, the “Camera Control” button, the new “Photographic Styles”, and it’ll get access to Apple Intelligence (AI) when those features launch. That’s in addition to the “Action Button” and other extras launched on the Pro models last year.', 'Taken all together, this makes the iPhone 16 not only an upgrade on last year’s iPhone 15 but in many ways an upgrade on the iPhone 15 Pro too. To find out just how much better it is, I’ve been using it for the past few weeks to test out the latest improvements in comparison to its predecessor.', 'Apple iPhone 16: Quick verdict', '', 'What’s new in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus?', '', '', 'What’s the difference between the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro?', '', '', 'There’s a lot to like about the look of the new iPhone 16, starting with the range of available colours. I’m one of the few people who didn’t have anything to criticise about Apple’s more muted pastel approach to the colour range available on the iPhone 15 series of handsets, but it’s fair to say that the slightly deeper shades of the iPhone 16 are going to have more broad appeal.', 'Both the 16 and the 16 Plus come in the same range of colours: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black. I’m testing out the Ultramarine iPhone 16 for this review and I’ve got to say, it’s the best of the bunch for me. I’ve seen every colour in person though, and can confirm it’s a much bolder pink this time around, and the teal tone is lovely too. And you can pick the white (which wasn’t in last year’s lineup) or black if you prefer a simpler look. You can’t go wrong.', 'Overall, the feel of the phone and its design is going to be very familiar to any iPhone user, but these models do have the same subtly curved rear glass present in the iPhone 15 for a better feel in your hand, and the USB-C port that made its debut in the iPhone 15 too. They also sport the “Dynamic Island” on the display for showcasing useful information at a glance, and they’ve got a pair of new buttons: a customisable “Action Button” on the left-hand side (replacing the mute switch) and a new “Camera Control” switch on the lower right-hand side for, well, controlling the camera (more on this in the next section).', 'On the iPhone 15, I used to use the “Action Button” to quickly launch the camera, and with the inclusion of the “Camera Control” I’ve found that’s not needed anymore. I don’t need to use the action button to control the mute switch like it used to, so I’ve enjoyed trying to find a few new ways to use it. Having a completely customisable button like this is handy and not available from most rivals. I’m finding it great as a quick way to turn on “Do Not Disturb” but you could also set it to turn on the torch, start a voice memo or access other controls, shortcuts and accessibility features.', 'The display is, overall, almost identical to the one on last year’s iPhone. But it will be a very noticeable upgrade to anyone coming from an older model like the iPhone 11 or 12, given that it has far stronger glass and better brightness in outdoor conditions, making it easier to read text in more environments. What it doesn’t have, though, is an “always-on display” or adaptive refresh rate. You might not know whether you need these features, but they can be really useful depending on how you use your phone, and are widely available in Android competitors (and the Pro iPhones), making it a real shame that they’re still not included on the standard Apple models.', 'The camera improvements will be the most evident changes for most upgraders, whether you’re coming from an iPhone 11 or a three-year-old iPhone 13. What you’ll be able to see is the extra detail available from the 48-megapixel “Fusion” camera and the macro close-up abilities of the 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with autofocus. The main lens on the iPhone 16 brings you a 2x zoom too, making this a far more versatile photo and video companion compared to a model like the iPhone 12 or 13.', 'I love using all of the cameras on the iPhone 16. Its main camera is the most capable by far, and the 2x zoom into the large sensor is something I use all the time. It’s great for portraits – and, for most people, is going to go a long way towards making up for the lack of the dedicated telephoto lens that you’d need to buy the Pro iPhone models to get. Since the iPhone 14, the front-facing selfie camera has included autofocus, and that’s something you’ll notice if you find you get blurry selfies on your current phone.', 'In use, all the results I’ve got from the iPhone cameras are very comparable to the shots from the iPhone 15. Overall, they’re excellent. By default, they feel neutral, balanced and have a lot of dynamic range so you can capture the whole scene clearly. Of course, there’s a lot of processing happening to these snaps and this is hard to avoid, but Apple’s new “Photographic Styles” give you lots of control over the look of your pictures.', 'You get to pick between lots of different colour and tonal styles to save as your default, and I’ve settled on the “Amber” with a slight reduction on the “tone” slider, which adds more contrast and deeper shadows to images, making them look a little more like the photos I get from my dedicated camera. The best thing about these “Styles” is how customisable and controllable they are, and you can tweak them after you’ve shot images too – I’ve particularly liked using “Amber”, “Gold”, “Natural” and “Stark Black & White” during testing.', 'To help you decide if you like the look of pictures shot with the iPhone 16, I’ve included a gallery of sample images (mostly shot in the “Amber” photographic style) below:', 'As mentioned above, Apple’s new “Camera Control” switch (which is flush on the bottom right-hand side of the phone) is its other most noticeable camera change. It’s most useful as a one-click way to launch the camera and it responds to a half press, swipes and double half press inputs for customising various parts of the camera system. With those, you can use it to control how much you’re zoomed in or the amount of portrait mode “depth” in your image.', 'I like a lot about this button, especially for fast camera access, but it’s sadly not always the most intuitive to use. I think many users will benefit from turning off its ability to make adjustments (an option available in the accessibility settings) and I’m most looking forward to a feature Apple teased in September that’ll allow it to be used to lock focus and exposure, much like a larger mirrorless or DSLR camera.', 'So far, I’ve found that the best use of the “Camera Control” is for one-handed camera use (if you’re holding a coffee cup in your other hand, for example) and for quickly launching the camera. It’s certainly useful, but just needs some improvement.', 'It’s also worth mentioning that there are upgrades to videos on the iPhone 16 too, with the phone now capturing “spatial audio” for more immersive videos, along with “wind noise reduction” to get rid of irritating background blustery wind sounds in your clips. It also offers excellent “Audio Mix” options to tweak the sound of your videos after you’ve captured them, helping you make them more intimate or more cinematic.', 'The brand-new A18 chip is something new to the iPhone 16, which would typically inherit a processor from the iPhone of the previous year. This chip, along with increased RAM, is what will allow the iPhone 16 to run the Apple Intelligence (AI) features launching later this year on all the newest iPhone models.', 'These features are available in beta at the moment for some users, but I’ll review them when they’re widely available for everyone – they’re set to include ways to help you with rewriting and proofreading text, as well as summarising notifications and emails.', 'Beyond promised features for the future, the A18 is still a powerful upgrade to the brains of Apple’s standard iPhone model. With this chip, it’s able to be much faster and more efficient than previous models, benefiting its “machine learning” and enabling the latest-generation “Photographic Styles” as well as making the phone 60% faster than the iPhone 12 for most tasks, and 40% faster than last year’s iPhone 15 for graphics-intense gaming.', 'When it comes to battery life, the iPhone 16 remains a worthwhile option, although Apple isn’t promising loads more longevity on a daily basis when compared to last year’s models. What’s most impressive is that the larger iPhone 16 Plus should last for an extensive 27 hours of video playback, which is a boost of an extra hour compared to the iPhone 15 Plus. The regular iPhone 16 gains two extra hours of video playback, for a total of 22 hours.', 'The phone is equipped with fast wireless charging over MagSafe and Qi2, and can restore 50% of its battery capacity in 30 minutes with the right adapter. In daily use, I’ve found I have absolutely no issue with the amount of battery life that the iPhone 16 delivers, and it won’t run out before the end of a normal day of messaging, social media, listening to music and podcasts and watching a few videos. It might run out earlier if used intensively but is no trouble to recharge with one of the best power banks.', 'The new iPhone 16 models come with Apple’s latest software upgrades in iOS 18, but it’s important to note that they don’t yet come with the “Apple Intelligence” or “AI” features that the brand is using in the marketing campaigns for these phones.', 'At launch, iOS 18 is a more customisable version of previous Apple software, giving you the ability to tweak your home screen layout by putting apps almost wherever you like and giving you dark mode or tinted icons for personalisation.', 'The newest operating system also features a more customisable Photos app, and noticeable improvements to the Calendar and Messages apps. There’s also a whole new Passwords app for managing and storing all your logins and wifi passwords securely.', 'In general, iOS 18 is a great update for personalising your phone, but it’s also an update that’s available for models as old as the iPhone XR, so it’s hardly a fresh feature exclusive to the iPhone 16 models.', 'When it becomes available for Brits in December, Apple Intelligence promises to unlock more capabilities from the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.', 'It will use the powerful chips in these phones to help summarise your notifications, to rewrite text with system-wide Writing Tools (that will be able to rewrite, proofread and summarise your emails, notes and more) and to bring you a more advanced and capable Siri assistant with a deeper integration and greater understanding of context.', 'Essentially, you will be able to speak more naturally and still be understood by the assistant, and it’ll understand more about your contacts, your calendar and the people in your photos.', 'The features of Apple Intelligence are set to roll out gradually and only when they’re ready, so don’t expect them to all launch at once even when they do start coming to phones in the UK. They will also primarily run on your device or within Apple’s “Private Cloud” which is meant to be transparent enough for independent checks from security researchers. You also aren’t required to use any AI features, they’re optional and “opt-in” only.', 'The iPhone 16 follows the same storage options as previous models, offering 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone with smaller storage, like the 64GB iPhone 12 or SE, I think you’ll notice the extra room for your files, photos, documents and videos.', 'I find the added capacity is most useful when I’m downloading offline content to watch or listen to during a trip, or if I need space for more demanding apps such as big games. Ultimately, unless you find yourself running out of space on your current iPhone, you might not see a big difference.', 'However, I think it’s always preferable to have a little extra room for a few films from Netflix, downloading a whole series on BBC iPlayer films or your favourite playlists on Spotify or Apple Music.', 'Having the extra space means there’s no need to constantly manage your storage or worry about running out of room for apps and files.', 'One bit of welcome news is that the iPhone 16 sticks to the same price as the iPhone 15 launched at last year. This means it is more affordable than when the iPhone 14 launched in 2022. It starts at £799 for 128GB of storage, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at £899.', 'Is the iPhone 16 worth buying? Well, the first thing I’d ask any prospective upgrader is how old their current phone is and if they’re certain they need to upgrade. It’s worth considering how many iPhone features are available from older models that you might be able to find refurbished or at cheaper prices from other retailers. For example, the iPhone 14 still has a powerful chip, a highly capable dual camera system and impressive battery life. Go with that, and it’ll cost you £200 less than the new phone.', 'What it’s important to decide, then, is whether the latest features (in particular, the new buttons, most powerful processor, more advanced camera, and USB-C port) and the promise of Apple Intelligence are going to make enough of a difference in your daily experience of using your phone.', 'Don’t think they will? Then it may be sensible to stick with your current phone (if it feels sluggish, it may need a battery replacement, which only costs around £90 at an Apple Store) or consider which of the features you need and if they’re offered on the iPhone 14 or iPhone 15. In general, I don’t think anyone who currently owns a handset that’s only two years old needs to be looking at an upgrade yet. Apple’s phones are built for long-term use of around three to four years (if not more).', 'If, after thinking all that through, you still feel like you need an upgrade, I can confirm that the iPhone 16 is a terrific iPhone that anyone would be delighted to own.', 'I love the new colour range, especially the Ultramarine of the model that I’m testing, and when you’re upgrading from an older phone it’s worth remembering just how much extra brightness this screen now has and how much more versatile it is with the addition of the USB-C port with simpler charging and more compatibility with accessories.', 'The camera system is a pro-level setup with a 2x zoom and close-up focus for more photography opportunities, and it’s excellent when shooting videos. The new buttons also make it more personalised, and help you to get right to taking a photo or video faster than before. Anybody upgrading from an iPhone 11, 12 or 13 is going to find the iPhone 16 to be a huge leap forward.', 'The main phone I’d now recommend instead of the iPhone 16 is its predecessor, the iPhone 15. It’s still sold as new by Apple and has seen a £100 price cut with the launch of the new one, making it even better value than it was mere weeks ago.', 'It’s a terrific handset with pro-level features including the “Dynamic Island” within the display, the USB-C connector, a 48-megapixel camera that enables a 2x zoom and even more detail within photos. I also love the subtle pastel colours of this model.', 'There are only a handful of differences between the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16, and most of them aren’t significant enough to prevent me from recommending it.', 'The other main competitive rival I’d recommend would be for those mulling over a switch to the Android operating system. The latest Google Pixel phones are excellent, and the Google Pixel 9 is a brilliant handset with a smooth interface, smart features, fantastic cameras and a distinctive design. The Google Pixel 9 is my favourite all-around Android of 2024 for most people, and it’s the one to go for if you’re tempted by Android.', 'Simon Cocks is Hearst UK’s Technology Ecommerce Editor, overseeing tech shopping content and strategy across a range of titles including Good Housekeeping UK, Esquire UK, Digital Spy, Men’s Health UK and Women’s Health UK.', ""Simon specialises in testing the latest smart gadgets, home entertainment gear, headphones, speakers, portable chargers, radios, ebook readers and smartphones.
