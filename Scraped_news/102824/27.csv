Firstly, Israel has for the first time declared a strike against Iran\'s hinterland, marking a shift in the conflict between Israel and Iran from proxy and covert wars to direct conflict. Secondly, this attack occurred amid tensions in southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, as well as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

The root of the issue lies in Israel\'s current occupation and attacks on the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and southern Lebanon. Therefore, to ease conflicts and reduce tensions, all Israeli attacks should be halted, and agreements should be reached for exchange of prisoners. This would pave the way for rebuilding and restoring humanitarian aid and resuming negotiations to achieve the goal of establishing the State of Palestine based on the June 4,1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,"" said Fattah.', 'The strikes came after several public threats from Israel. The previous threats include attacks on Iran’s military facilities in response to Iran’s Oct. 1 missile attacks.', ""Iran launched some 200 ballistic missiles targeting Tel Aviv’s key locations.
