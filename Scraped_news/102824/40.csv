Though the whole event exhibited little semblance of structure, its 23-year-old organizer, a popular stunt-happy YouTuber named Anthony Po (though he sometimes goes by “Gilbert”), had provided the usual contest ephemera: a shiny six-foot-tall trophy, a humongous $50 check made out to “Best Tim,” and a briefcase full of fun-sized Halloween candy.', 'Did Anthony Po, the 23-year-old YouTuber who organized the Timmy lookalike contest, expect the event to get as wild as it did? “Legally, I should say no,” he says.', 'These days, Chalamet—who grew up in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen, graduated from LaGuardia High School, and attended both Columbia University and NYU before dropping out to pursue acting—tends to cause a scene whenever he goes anywhere in his hometown.

NYPD officers and more uniformed members of the city’s Parks Enforcement Patrol made their way through the square, yelling for the crowd to disperse for gathering without a permit. Suddenly, a few inches away from where I stood, an NYPD officer grabbed the wrists of one of the Timmy lookalikes, who had long curls and wore a knit poncho.

Are you detaining me?” the lookalike repeatedly asked the police officer; later, the young man appeared to use his own phone to record the altercation while he requested that the officers explain the charges. The crowd circled around them, shouting “Free Timmy!” and “Let him go!” and “This is fascism!” Per footage captured on an AP livestream, the lookalike was eventually handcuffed and led away from the park by the NYPD, who put him into a patrol car.

Per the Associated Press, the event was fined for “unpermitted costume contest,” and one contestant was arrested. So the event got shut down by the 5-0, but not before crowning a winner and being visited by Timmy himself.

Timothée, 28, photobombed two of the contestants before the fans realized what was happening. The group then erupted into cheers as people swarmed the Wonka actor to snap pics, according to videos shared on social media.', 'Timothée’s been working hard on his upcoming film, A Complete Unknown, a biopic of singer Bob Dylan, but making it to the top of the Hollywood elite hasn’t been very from his mind. On August 9, a source revealed to Life & Style that the Don’t Look Up star is determined to stay ahead of box office rival Glen Powell.', '“Timmy locked up his status as the leading man of his generation with his massive Dune hits and the unexpected breakout of Wonka,” the insider said, “but now he’s having to give the competition a serious look and the leader of that pack is Glen Powell.”', 'The source continued, “Glen is a little older, but [Timothée and Glen] are constantly circling the same filmmakers and sometimes the same scripts. If you know Timmy, you want to bet on him, but there is such a thing as being too competitive and that’s Timmy’s weakness.”', 'However, Glen, 36, isn’t the only star Timothée has had his eye on. A separate insider revealed that the Little Women actor wants to surpass Leonardo DiCaprio’s career.', '“Timmy is open about his admiration for Leo and even about the times he has directly sought Leo’s advice, but there’s definitely a double-edged sword to this kind of obsession he has to be aware of,” the source revealed to Life & Style on August 16. “This is what Timmy wants, and it’s why he has carefully studied Leo since he was a teenager and why he made a point of paying his respects to Leo when he became a full-blown leading man in the last couple of years.”', 'The insider added, “I can tell you, his number one priority is to build a career that’s even bigger than Leo’s – by any means necessary.”', 'While Timothée has been focused on his career, that doesn’t mean he’s let his love life set on the backburner. The Call Me By Your Name star has been dating Kylie Jenner for over a year. Rumors swirled that Kylie, 27, was pregnant with Timothée’s child around six months after they confirmed their relationship in September 2023, all thanks to Daniel Tosh.', '“I went to the grocery store in Malibu, and I was talking to an employee there. I try to avoid it but I was talking to this guy, and I said, ‘Why were you guys closed yesterday?’ He goes, ‘Well, I’m not supposed to discuss it, but Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the show, was filming their season finale here yesterday,” Daniel, 49, said during an April episode of his “Tosh Show” podcast.', 'The comedian then went on to say the reason the store was closed was because they were going to reveal Kylie’s pregnancy in the season finale.

Anthony Po (also known by the pseudonym Gilbert when referring to the organization of this specific event) says he and his friends have been putting on similar events like this in the city since the beginning of 2024.', '“We more or less do the same thing every time for marketing, just hang up a couple flyers and try to host,” Po tells Teen Vogue. “A small community event. This one has definitely turned into something more.”', 'On Saturday, October 26, the same team hosted a Kai Cenat Lookalike Contest that had barely 20 people attend. So, Sunday’s Chalamet contest with a turnout of over 2,000 people — with Timothée himself showing up — just was not something they could’ve expected nor prepared for.', 'TRENDING NOW', 'LE SSERAFIM Play ""I Dare You""', 'Roberto, 23, lives with Po and served as their lead bodyguard for the event. “I got put into a group chat yesterday and now I’m here with an earpiece,” he says. “The scale of it, I didn’t expect this.”', 'The event was held at Washington Square Park, in the heart of the campus of New York University, Timmy’s own alma mater. From protests to influencers with tiny microphones conducting random interviews to full-scale TV and film productions, you’re set to see just about anything happen under the arch on any given day. Around 12:30, groups of girls, Timmy hopefuls, and other curious minds began to converge in the park, whispering amongst each other to ask if they were in the right place for the Timothée Chalamet Lookalike Contest. Young women hoping to find love arrived with signs and business cards with their phone numbers emblazoned; others traveled from across the country to win the miniscule cash prize.', 'But Sunday’s attendees and contestants would be leaving with a lot more. About an hour before the event began, notable and infamous Timothée fan account @ClubChalamet posted a link on X to an official news livestream of the event, confirming that there would be more eyes on this event than first predicted. (ClubChalamet declined to comment on the event to Teen Vogue.) The event surged in a way only true movie stardom could inspire.', 'There were lookalikes dressed as Chalamet-as-Bob-Dylan. There were several Willy Wonkas (a byproduct of Halloween being so close on the horizon). There were lookalikes that did not know they were lookalikes, entering the contest only after repeated assumptions were made as to why they were even there. Then there were some who competed by force of their girlfriends.', 'At 1 p.m. sharp, the starting gates were open, and a red carpet, a large trophy, and a giant cardboard check for an ironically small sum awaited at the base of the arch. It took only 12 minutes for the event to be shut down.', 'NYPD arrived at a nearly identical moment in which Chalamet himself pulled up to snap a few photos with his doppelgängers. According to ClubChalamet, there was over $5,000 raised for charity with a specific request that Timmy make an appearance at the event. As police pushed into the large crowd, attendees began to boo as Po tried to keep the pandemonium at bay.', '“They are scared it’s going to be unsafe and too rowdy,” Paige, head creator and producer of the event, says while her team is handed a bright pink citation for $500. “Now that a lot of our crew is occupied with trying to communicate with the deputies, it’s a little out of hand so we’re trying to keep it as civil as possible.”', 'Law enforcement stated that the group did not have a permit to host the event and they could no longer hold it at the park. This led to an impromptu Timothée Chalamet parade around the Village, with the event moving a few blocks over to Mercer Playground. Roberto the bodyguard says that the team had a Plan B location set in place for this very reason. As the crowd marched, some attendees loitered at the arch. They were met with aggression, with officers yelling into their megaphones: “If you do not clear the area you will be summoned.” One of the Chalamet lookalikes was handcuffed. The creators of the event believe he might’ve been hauled off as a mistaken member of the organizing party.', '“It was a shame we copped a $500 fine, but it’s the price of culture,” Gilbert says. And while the contest was a clear success, Gilbert says the team has no plans to host anymore lookalike contests in the future.', 'Amidst the chaos, Miles, wearing a Willy Wonka costume, took home the coveted cash prize and trophy. Below we spoke to several Timmy-T lookalikes and attendees about the alluring and disorienting spectacle of the 2024 Timothée Chalamet Lookalike Contest.', '“[Timothée] gave me a nice big hug. I thought he was another clone. He put his hand on my shoulder and I was like ‘Okay, he’s taking a photo with us.’ It was him though. He gave me a hug, it was really comfy. He’s wearing a really soft sweater. Some guy with him was like, ‘Do we have an exit plan?’”', '“Halloween is around the corner, I thought, I might as well wear this [Wonka costume] to the contest. I brought candy to make it more interactive.”', '“These cards have my name, image, and a bespoke email on them because Hinge is not working and I have to try different things.”', '“I saw the flyer over in the East Village and thought, ‘I want to do this.’ There’s a lot of different types of Timmys, but these sideburns are all me. If they want me to shave them to look more like Chalamet then I’m ready to do it.”', ""“I knew that the contest was happening today, but I didn’t plan on entering. I’ve gotten before that I look like Timothée Chalamet but I didn't expect it in the first 30 seconds of walking into the park.”"", '“I’m from St. Louis, Missouri and I drove to be here. To be a good Timothée you’ve got to have the hair right, you’ve got to be a little lanky.”', '“I made that decision to bring him, maybe not my best, but it’s okay. I go to NYU and I’ve been seeing the posters everywhere. I immediately sent it to my boyfriend and told him he had to come.”', '“I live on Long Island so I came down. Timothée Chalamet is my idol.

I’m just so glad I get to experience the love of Timothée Chalamet with this crowd.”', '“I can’t remember how I saw the flyer originally, but my friend in Tennessee sent it to me, too, which is crazy.

Inside the Chaos (and Hormones) of Timothée Chalamet's Lookalike Contest,https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-lookalike-contest,"['', '', '', ""Anthony “Gilbert” Po is a bit in shock. That's what the content creator-turned-event organizer tells me moments before his first-annual Timothée Chalamet Lookalike Contest is about to start. Over the last month, Po put up “maybe 50” paper signs around West Village advertising the contest—and now, there are over 100 faux-Chalamets and their entourages mobbing Washington Square Park. “The event started out as a joke,” Po says. “To me, it will be until the very end. But I have friends working on the movie set he's shooting in Soho right now. He was talking about the competition, he knows it's happening. But I'm not sure if this is the safest place for him to just show up.”"", ""Before Po, who actually resembles the actor we've all gathered to celebrate, can hop onto his antique bicycle and get the event started, the New York City cops show up. The crowd starts to grumble. “I wasn't expecting Timothée to be here, but I wanted to see some hot lookalikes,” says Lola Wayne Villa, a student who found out about the event through the posters. As the cops start to issue citations (but before they start arresting people), Po cycles by like a top-hatted Pied Piper and the Chalamets follow. Apparently, he doesn't know the fuzz has arrived."", ""Once organized in a circle, Po explains the very scientific rules: The crowd will be presented with each Chalamet and the one with the loudest cheers will be crowned king, winning a 6-foot trophy and a giant check for $50. There are a lot of off-duty Chalamets, a handful of all-black clad Dune screaming “I am the Voice from the Outer World! I will lead you to paradise!”, a solitary wigged Bob Dylan, and one very spirited Willy Wonka who is carrying a suitcase to complete his look. The actor's appeal surpasses the human species, and there's both a Corgi and a Pug here to compete."", 'RELATED VIDEO', 'Katy Perry Gets Ready for the Balenciaga Show in Paris', ""“I don't like big crowds,” Kyle, who is dressed in a black sweater and skinny scarf, tells me as his curls fall into his brown eyes. “But my parents read about this in the newspaper and really wanted me to do this. People have filmed me before at the airport thinking I was Timothée.”"", ""The cops finally squeeze through the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd to deliver the shutdown message—Washington Square Park's board has issued a cease-and-desist order. We're moving to a nearby park. Along the way, Dylan Chalamet is stopped a handful of times, including by an enterprising blonde handing out cards to all of the lookalikes with a headshot and her Instagram handle on it."", ""Now at location two, Po stops the judging to start auctioning off the single Chalamets. If you can't get the real one, a finalist in the lookalike competition may just be the next best thing. Two walk away with dates, but one confesses he lives in Arkansas—and the crowd begins to boo."", ""Finally, back on track, the final three Chalamets answer a few questions in character (which Marvel character would you play? What can you say in French?) but it's Willy Wonka's suitcase reveal—it's filled with candy! He's throwing it out into the crowd!—that wins him the honor of ear-drum-shattering screams and the 6-foot trophy. Apparently, we're not above bribery."", 'While Wonka (real name: Miles Mitchell) soaks up his day in the Chalamet Sun, Po shares the biggest surprise of the day: An unrepresented Chalamet appeared at Washington Square Park after the event moved locations… the real one. Not only did Timothée know about the event, but he braved the masses, too. Hold onto that trophy, Mitchell.', 'MORE FROM VOGUE', 'SEE MORE STORIES', '© 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.
