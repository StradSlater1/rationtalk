Health officials initially focused on fresh slivered onions and beef patties as the possible sources of the McDonald's outbreak. But the beef patties are an unlikely source because of federal requirements for testing meat and McDonald’s protocols that call for cooking it to a temperature that kills the bacteria. The onions are served raw."", 'Symptoms occur quickly, within a day or two of eating contaminated food, and typically include fever, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, and signs of dehydration — little or no peeing, increased thirst, and dizziness. The infection can cause a type of serious kidney injury, especially in kids younger than 5. E coli poisoning in young children requires immediate medical attention.', 'The type of bacteria implicated in this outbreak causes about 74,000 infections in the US annually, leading to more than 2,000 hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to the CDC. In general, E. coli infections were lower in 2023 than in recent years and cases of severe kidney injury caused by the bacteria remained stable, according to latest federal data.', 'Food poisoning sickens at least 48 million people in the US each year, including 128,000 who are hospitalized and 3,000 who die. E coli poisoning is only one cause of such infections. Other germs can make people sick, too. The most common is norovirus, a group of bacteria that cause between 19 million and 21 million cases of food poisoning in the US each year, according to the CDC.

Sprouts and bagged salad greens: What food safety experts steer clear of to avoid E. coli,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/avoid-e-coli-food-safety-expert-tips-rcna177311,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'An E. coli outbreak that has sickened at least 75, killing one, is a reminder of the contamination risk that can plague certain types of fresh produce, according to food safety experts.', 'The four professors said they routinely avoid particular raw fruits and vegetables themselves, such as sprouts, bagged salad greens and cantaloupe.', 'Though the investigation is ongoing, federal officials suspect prewashed, slivered onions that were served raw on McDonald’s Quarter Pounders are the likely source of the E. coli outbreak. For those who specialize in foodborne illness prevention, the news was not a surprise.', 'Don Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers University, said that the more food is handled and processed on its journey from the farm to a restaurant or grocery store, the more opportunities there are to introduce or spread bacteria. That includes slicing, prewashing or adding ingredients.', '“The more manipulation you do, certainly the more places there are for things to go wrong,” Schaffner said.', 'By nature, when fruits and vegetables are served uncooked, there’s no opportunity to heat away bacteria. This has contributed to past E. coli outbreaks linked to produce, including a 2006 outbreak in prepackaged baby spinach that sickened over 200 and dozens of instances of E. coli and other foodborne illnesses that have been associated with contaminated sprouts. Cantaloupe also has been contaminated with pathogens, including salmonella and listeria.', '“If you look at just the sheer number of outbreaks and recalls over the last 15 years, we typically see more cases of E. coli tied to produce,” said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food regulatory policy at Northeastern University.', 'Although there were serious E. coli incidents decades ago in meat — including an outbreak linked to Jack in the Box hamburgers that made hundreds of people ill and killed four in the early 1990s — changes to federal regulations and a better understanding of proper cooking temperatures needed to kill off the bacteria have reduced those cases. ', 'Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said that she makes an effort to avoid eating bagged greens, sprouts and cantaloupe. Bags or containers that hold lettuce or other leafy greens can seal in bacteria and create an environment for it to proliferate, she said, so for salads, she opts for heads of lettuce at the grocery store instead.', '“Any leaf that is torn or damaged, I just throw it away, because that’s how the bacteria can get in there,” she said. “And I usually take the outer leaves off and discard them.”', 'She then thoroughly washes and dries the lettuce.', '“The key is running water and using a clean paper towel to dry it,” she said. “The bacteria are kind of sticky, and friction is what gets them off.”', 'Schaffner said previous E. coli outbreaks involving prewashed, leafy greens resulted from not enough chlorine in the water as they were being rinsed. With sprouts, it’s a different concern, he said: The seeds are exposed to warm temperatures and, as they sprout, release nutrients into the water that allow bacteria to grow.', 'Cut melons, meanwhile, can be a common breeding ground for pathogens, especially if they’re left sitting out.', '“I do a lot of workshops, and they often have cut fruit on the breakfast buffet, and that fruit just sits there all day long,” Schaffner said. “We’ve done research to show that the physical appearance of it doesn’t change, but it can grow bacteria like nobody’s business.”', 'Detwiler is particularly careful to avoid cantaloupe because of its webbed rind, where bacteria can easily hide. ', '“It’s one of the most deadly pieces of produce out there, of all things,” he said. “Cantaloupe has a perfect pH, and you can’t clean the outside enough.”', 'E. coli spreads in the environment through animal or human feces and from there can contaminate food and water. While significant improvements in agriculture have minimized the spread of pathogens on fields where produce is grown, experts said it’s still important for consumers to consider the risk of E. coli — particularly for young children, individuals over 65 and anyone with a compromised immune system, including those who are pregnant. ', '“This is a really unique pathogen, because there’s a very low infectious dose. So it can take only a few cells to get someone very sick,” said Kali Kniel, professor of microbial food safety at the University of Delaware.', 'The food safety experts interviewed also said they steer clear of rare or undercooked meat, poultry, fish and eggs, and don’t drink unpasteurized milk.', 'Some mentioned, as well, that they look for signs of cleanliness when dining out.

On Tuesday, the CDC reported 49 cases and one death linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders tainted with E. coli. In the past week, hundreds of waffle and pancake products were voluntarily recalled due to potential Listeria contamination. Listeria, in particular,  has been a problem of late: Earlier in October, more than 11 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products were recalled. And an especially bad Listeria outbreak involving Boar’s Head deli-meat products has led to 59 hospitalizations across 10 states and 10 deaths.', '', 'Many of this year’s outbreaks have occurred in foods that are pre-prepared—those that can be eaten as-is, without further cooking. Foods such as Quarter Pounders and waffles, yes, but also cold cuts, prepackaged salads, and jarred salsa are popular because they are convenient. That convenience comes at a cost. A rule of thumb in food safety is that “the more a food is handled prior to consumption, the higher the chances it can be contaminated,” Lawrence Goodridge, the director of the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety, told me.

The CDC says that about 48 million people get sick from foodborne diseases every year. Here's a guide to these illnesses, from symptoms to treatment."", 'What it is: A bacteria that lives in the intestines of people and animals, and is known as Escherichia coli, or E. coli. Though it is harmless while in the gut, ingesting certain types of E. coli — such as E. coli O157:H7 — can cause severe gastrointestinal issues, according to the Mayo Clinic. One way E. coli is spread is when feces contaminate food and water. Since animals can potentially carry pathogenic E. coli, touching animals, such as at a petting zoo, can potentially put you at risk.', 'What the symptoms are: Stomach issues include severe cramping, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Fever is also common. In extreme cases, E. coli may lead to a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), or the development of high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease and neurologic problems, according to the FDA.', '“If people develop bloody diarrhea or have a decline in urine output or are pale, they should seek medical attention,” says Shaw.', ""What experts need you to know: Consuming ground beef can potentially put you at a greater risk of E. coli exposure. “If you cook your steak, and you cook the outside, you’re usually safe from it,” says Parsonnet. “But if you make hamburgers, you’re taking the outside of the meat that’s been contaminated, and you're mixing it in the middle.” (The USDA recommends cooking ground beef to a safe minimum internal temperature of 160°F to destroy harmful bacteria.)"", 'But it’s not just ground beef that’s linked to outbreaks. “A few years ago, there was an E. coli outbreak in apple juice because it was probably contaminated by feces,” says Parsonnet. Anything that’s contaminated with animal feces, such as produce grown in fields, has the potential to expose you to E. coli, she says.', 'What it is: A disease-causing bacteria called listeria monocytogenes. It can survive and grow under refrigeration. The disease people develop after eating food contaminated with this bacteria is called listeriosis.', 'What the symptoms are: Mild symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, while symptoms for the more severe form of listeriosis include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).', 'What experts need you to know: “Listeria has the unfortunate property to grow under refrigeration temperatures, which is uncommon for foodborne illness,” Dr. Albert Shaw tells Yahoo Life. Shaw is an infectious diseases specialist and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Shaw added: “It can contaminate any food really, but we see outbreaks in raw fruits and vegetables, as well as improperly heated hot dogs and things like deli meats. Unpasteurized milk or soft cheeses, especially Brie and queso that are made with potentially unpasteurized ingredients, have been associated with outbreaks in the past.”', 'While listeriosis symptoms can typically be treated at home, Dr. Julie Parsonnet notes that the disease can be serious in certain individuals. Parsonnet is a professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine. “Pregnant women are at risk because the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and the placenta, and there’s a high risk of fetal loss due to the infection,” she tells Yahoo Life. “The elderly can also get listeria in their blood and their brain, causing meningitis. It’s not a common cause of disease, but among the foodborne illnesses, listeria is one of the more common causes of death.”', 'What it is: A group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness. It’s typically associated with meat and poultry as well as undercooked eggs, but dairy products, fruits and leafy greens can also be contaminated.', 'What the symptoms are: Gastrointestinal illness, which includes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. More severe illnesses associated with salmonella include high fever, lethargy, a rash and blood in the urine or stool, according to the FDA.', 'What experts need you to know: In the U.S., poultry and eggs — as seen with this recent outbreak and recall — are the most common sources of salmonella, says Parsonnet. You can typically avoid the bacteria by cooking your food. It’s also important to avoid cross contamination while preparing food, making sure that raw ingredients don’t touch anything you will be consuming.', 'Shaw says that for those with a normal immune system, salmonella typically runs its course in two to three days. Though most people recover at home, Parsonnet says it’s possible to see “severe illness in people who are immunocompromised or have sickle cell anemia.”', 'What it is: A highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. Exposure typically happens when people come into close contact with an infected person, as well as through eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the virus.', 'What the symptoms are: Lethargy, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, joint pain and dark-colored urine are all common symptoms. Clay- or gray-colored stool, as well as intense itching and jaundiced skin, are signs that can distinguish a hepatitis A infection from other foodborne illnesses.', 'What experts need you to know: Hepatitis A is rare in the U.S., thanks to vaccinations, notes Parsonnet. Adults who get hepatitis A typically recover within one to two weeks, but it’s possible for the disease to become chronic, which can lead to liver failure and death.', 'Shaw says that hepatitis A “is usually foodborne, either from contamination in the fields or with a food handler who is preparing food without sufficient precautions. Transmission can come from someone going to the bathroom and not washing their hands sufficiently and then preparing food.”', 'Recent hepatitis A outbreaks have been linked to strawberries, as well as raw scallops, frozen tuna and conventional blackberries.', 'What it is: A highly contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea.', 'What the symptoms are: Norovirus causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. “It usually resolves within two to three days,” says Shaw. These symptoms typically last one to three days, according to the Mayo Clinic.', 'What experts need you to know: Typically, people become infected after coming into contact with the virus by consuming food or drink contaminated by another person with the virus, or by coming into contact with a surface or object with the virus and then touching their mouth.', 'According to the CDC, norovirus is responsible for about 50% of all outbreaks of food-related illness, most of which happen in food-service settings such as restaurants.', ""“This is the virus that's associated with outbreaks on cruise ships,” Shaw points out. “It is highly contagious because the dose that you need to become infected is really low.”"", 'Parsonnet agrees, adding: “If you have it, you can easily give it to your family and to other people in the household” through being in close contact, such as sharing food or eating utensils. Most people recover without treatment, but symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting can cause severe dehydration.', 'The treatment for mild foodborne illness is typically rest and drinking plenty of fluids in order to avoid dehydration. In rare and severe cases, listeria and salmonella may be treated with antibiotics.', 'It’s also important to keep an eye on your symptoms, notes Parsonnet. A fever greater than 102°F, bloody diarrhea or diarrhea with mucus, bad abdominal cramps, weakness or confusion, and symptoms that don’t improve within 48 hours warrant reaching out to a health care provider.', 'This article was originally published on June 15, 2023, and has been updated.']"

', 'It typically takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak. Those infected with the toxin-producing E. coli experience severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, and most recover without treatment after five to seven days.', ""People are advised to call their health care provider if they ate a McDonald's Quarter Pounder and have severe E. coli symptoms, as follows: "", ""The health worries about one of McDonald's most popular menu items comes as fast-food chains try to attract consumers still smarting from high food prices. The company this summer launched a $5 value meal in a bid to draw lower-income customers."", ""The outbreak is not the first to be linked to the Golden Arches.
