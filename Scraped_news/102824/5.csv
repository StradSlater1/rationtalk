Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), are “more dangerous” than foreign adversaries such as Russia and China.', '“Well, I think what Donald Trump said is that those folks pose a greater threat to [the] United States’s peace and security because America is strong enough to stand up to any foreign adversary,” Vance said, before being pressed on whether he thought certain political opponents “pose a much larger threat” than Russia and China.', '“What he said — and I do agree with this — what he said is that the biggest threat we have in our country, it’s not a foreign adversary because we can handle these guys. … Look, under Nancy Pelosi’s long life in public leadership, the United States has gone from the preeminent industrial power in the world to second next to China. That fundamentally belongs on Nancy Pelosi’s shoulders. And if we’re going to have a more prosperous country, we’ve got to recognize that our own leadership is why we lost our industrial base to China.

That’s what that enemy within—” before Vance cut in, “Did he say that he wants to use the military against those people?”', '“He wants to use the military to go after the enemy within,” Tapper answered.', '“No, no, no,” Vance said. “Let me — can I answer the question, please? He said that he wanted to use the military to go after far-left lunatics who were rioting. And he also called them — he also called them the enemy within.”', 'Vance insisted that Trump “separately” described Pelosi and Schiff “in a totally different context” as “threats to this country.” After Tapper pointed out that Trump has also specifically described both Pelosi and Schiff as the “enemy within” Vance replied, “So, every time he uses the exact same phrase, we assumed that he uses the military?”', 'The two engaged in crosstalk again before Vance fired off, “And you’re asking his vice president, but you won’t let me answer the question. I’m telling you that Donald Trump has said, and I agree with him, that we should use the U.S. military to go after Americans. People who riot, who burned down our cities.

Trump, Vance said, “was just talking honestly about the fact that Detroit has been left behind.”', 'And when Trump name-dropped a Democratic congressman when he warned about an “enemy within” and stoked fears of chaos justifying military intervention on Election Day? “The enemy within,” Vance offered, “are people that Kamala Harris let into this country unvetted, unchecked and undocumented.”', 'All Republicans — from top Trump surrogates to down-ballot candidates in local races — are inevitably forced to answer for Trump’s most inflammatory rhetoric. Many GOP members of Congress have made a ritual in recent years out of sidestepping questions about his latest outbursts, claiming not to be aware of what he said.', 'But Vance is, after Trump, the campaign’s most prominent player. His willingness to Trump-splain follows a well-documented conversion from Trump critic to loyalist. Eight years ago, he was a bestselling memoirist frequently called on to analyze — and lament — Trump’s appeal to voters in distressed manufacturing towns like the one he grew up in.', 'Today, it often falls to Vance to explain what Trump actually means, as he sees it — or to put a finer point on something shocking or puzzling that Trump has said while, above all else, never deviating from the Trump ethos of never apologizing.', '“I think that in 2016, I saw the divisiveness in American politics as at least partly Donald Trump’s fault, and by 2018, 2019, I saw that divisiveness as the fault of an American political and media culture that couldn’t even pay attention to its own citizens,” Vance said in a recent appearance on “The Interview,” a New York Times podcast. “And I think Donald Trump is, you know, not just — I put it this way, I don’t know that anybody else in 2016 possibly could have done what Trump did. And I think his rhetoric actually was a necessary part of it.”', 'Vance takes his role defending Trump seriously and believes strongly in keeping the focus on him and his ideas, an adviser to Vance told NBC News. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Explaining for Trump without overstepping him can be fraught, especially on delicate policy issues. At his debate with Harris last month, Trump clarified that, although Vance had said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump would veto a national abortion ban, the two had never discussed the matter. Vance later acknowledged he had “learned my lesson” about not getting ahead of the boss.', 'Trump and his advisers have been pleased with Vance’s performance after a messy rollout in which some of his own hot rhetoric about “childless cat ladies” running the Democratic Party distracted from the campaign’s message.', 'And while a plurality of voters continue to view Vance negatively, their opinions of him improved slightly after his debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. A recent national NBC News poll found 37% of respondents had positive feelings about Vance — up from 32% in September, though the result was within the margin of error.', 'Vance is careful not to stray from Trump’s core grievances and positions, most notably his false claims that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. The dispute over 2020 caused an irreparable rift between Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to block certification of their loss to Joe Biden and Harris.', 'At his debate this month with Walz, Vance declined to say whether Trump lost four years ago. Reporters in the days and weeks afterward hounded him to offer a more complete answer. After a rally last week in Pennsylvania, Vance contended that tech and media companies censored information that would have damaged Biden.', '“So, did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,” Vance said.', 'As he did on the recent New York Times podcast, Vance also has tried to explain and excuse Trump’s divisive tone, even while he acknowledges that he once blamed Trump for the nasty discourse in American politics. His most forceful defense of Trump’s language came after the second attempt to assassinate Trump. ', '“I really don’t think that President Trump, the onus is on him to tone down the rhetoric now that he’s on his second assassination attempt in [as] many months,” Vance told reporters under the wing of his campaign plane following a campaign visit to western Michigan two days after the man accused of seeking to assassinate Trump in Florida, Ryan Routh, was arrested.', '“I think the onus is on the left to really see and do what it can do,” Vance added.', 'Vance has also tried to clean up old Trump comments.', 'Asked last month in Newtown, Pennsylvania, about a 2021 interview in which Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “never wanted peace” with the Palestinians, Vance attempted a diplomatic dodge.', '“I think that what the president has said is that we want peace between Israel and the Palestinians, but the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job,” he said, referring to the war in the Middle East. “That’s a very simple thing.”', 'Vance also was pressed last week at a news conference in Minneapolis about Trump’s praise for Walz’s handling of the protests in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd.', '“Well, look, I think President Trump, during a conference call, said something nice and polite about Gov. Walz,” Vance responded, before he alluded to buildings, including a police station, that were set ablaze during the unrest. “Donald Trump was forced to be polite to Gov. Walz. … It doesn’t mean that he should have let rioters and looters burn down in the city of Minneapolis.”', 'In the instances when Trump trashed Detroit and suggested military force might be necessary on Election Day against the “enemy within,” Vance offered more nuanced and less heated rhetoric while also not indicating any substantive disagreements with Trump.', '“Is it a justifiable use of those assets if they’re rioting and looting and burning cities down to the ground? Of course it is,” Vance said in Minneapolis when he was asked by NBC News about the “enemy within” comments. “If you have a major reaction to an election in 2024, of course, you ought to commit law enforcement resources to bring the order back to our cities.”', 'On occasion, Vance doubles down on Trump’s inflammatory words, explaining why he believes they make sense — no matter how provocative they are. Aboard his campaign plane in July, after Trump questioned Harris’ race in an interview with Black journalists, Vance pre-emptively told reporters that he was aware of the “comments heard around the world.” (Trump said: “I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. ... Is she Indian or is she Black?”)', '“I thought it was hysterical,” Vance said, before he compared Harris to a color-changing lizard. “I think he pointed out the fundamental chameleon-like nature of Kamala Harris.”', 'Sometimes, though, Vance seems to understand that the less he says, the better. ', 'On Monday, a day after Trump trolled Harris by making french fries at a McDonald’s, Vance demurred when he was asked whether the stunt reflected an official campaign position that Harris is lying about the summer job she said she once held at the fast-food restaurant.', '“I don’t know if there’s a campaign position on it,” Vance said in an interview with Fox News host Bill Hemmer. “I don’t know what’s ultimately true here, but it’s interesting where the media will try to nitpick and micromanage every single thing that me or Donald Trump has said.”', 'And after Melania Trump’s new memoir revealed her supportive views on abortion rights — a position at odds with his own — Vance trod lightly. ', '“Look, I love Melania,” Vance said of the former first lady. “She’s been a great example of grace under an incredible amount of pressure, but Melania is entitled to her own views.”', 'Henry J.

They’ll say, well, he’s a dictator when what they really mean is they won’t listen,” Vance said. “Donald Trump would not listen to the leadership of the military when they wanted him to start ridiculous conflicts that is a consistent theme.”', 'But Tapper noted that Kelly has said he actually agrees with Donald Trump on most issues — and questioned Vance on where he was getting an idea that John Kelly is “pro-war” when he has not given any public indication that he wanted to go to war in Iran or Afghanistan.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Former officials who served under the Trump administration have spoken out against the former president, describing him as a threat to democracy and a national security threat as president. Most recently, former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired four-start general, in an interview with the New York Times and The Atlantic described Trump’s authoritarian tendencies and recounted Trump praising Hitler at one point. Vance has said he does not believe these stories are true. Other notable figures who have spoken along these lines include Mark Milley, former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump; Jim Mattis, former secretary of Defense under Trump; former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.', '“I don’t buy that because if you actually look at John Kelly, at folks like Liz Cheney, the fundamental disagreement they have with Donald Trump is even though they say that they’re conservative,” Vance said. “They’re conservative in the sense that they want America to get involved in a ton of ridiculous military conflicts.”', 'It’s a similar argument Vance has made in regards to former Vice President Mike Pence, who Vance claims no longer supports Trump because of foreign policy differences, and not the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 where rioters chanted “Hang Mike Pence.”', 'Vance also said he was “highly skeptical” that Kelly’s interviews were not in coordination with the Harris campaign — something he suggested during a rally earlier this week. When asked about what evidence he had for this, Vance said to Tapper: “You know the way that these attacks work. You know the way that these people are often vetted.”', '“So you made it up?” Tapper asked Vance. The Ohio senator responded: “No, I said that the American media and the American Democratic Party apparatus works a certain way.”', 'Vance also reiterated his claims that these people are “disgruntled former employees,” something he has described Kelly and other former Trump officials who have spoken out against Trump.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '“They didn’t think he was unfit for office until they had a falling out with him because he fired them,” Vance said in response. Tapper noted that many of these people — such as Pence and Milley — were not fired.', 'Kelly’s interviews this week came after recent comments from Trump, where he said the military should be deployed against “the enemy from within.” The former president has repeatedly said “the enemies from within” are a bigger threat than foreign adversaries and used Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi as examples of the “enemy from within.”', 'Vance pushed back on these comments — sparring with Tapper over what Trump actually said — and said Tapper was taking Trump’s words out of context.', 'Later on “State of the Union,” Liz Cheney joined Tapper and called Vance’s interview a “mix of desperation and naivete.”', '“I think what we just watched is what it looks like when someone has got to go through just unbelievable contortions to try to find a way to defend the person that JD Vance himself called America’s Hitler,” Cheney said. “And just so many, so many just really stunning attacks.”', 'She added, “The Trump campaign, Donald Trump, JD Vance, they absolutely understand how damaging it is for the American people to see all of these unprecedented levels of senior officials from the Trump administration telling the American people that Donald Trump is unfit. And so they concoct these things that are completely divorced from any connection to the truth to lash out and attack.”', 'Kelly’s fascism comments fueled the rest of the Sunday shows throughout the morning.', 'Republican senators Marco Rubio (Florida) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) defended the former president. Rubio said on “Fox News Sunday” that Kelly and Milley were lying and he was skeptical of the timing of their comments. Graham, meanwhile, said while he respects the generals, he does not believe these accusations.', '“They’re trying to scare Americans that this man can’t fix the problems we need fixed. I reject that,” Graham said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I was there too. I was around him. I don’t think he’s a fascist. I thought he was a very strong president at a time we needed a strong president.”', 'Shortly after, former Republican Gov. Chris Christie also joined ABC, where he called Graham a hypocrite.', '“Well, you want to talk about textbook hypocrite, I mean that’s Lindsey,” the New Jersey Republican said. “How the hell did Lindsey Graham sit in that chair and look in that camera and say the things he said about Donald Trump this morning? This is why people hate politics.”', 'Later on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he doesn’t like to use the word “fascist” but said Trump clearly has a “strong tendency to authoritarianism and to undermining American democracy.” And he said this is why generals and other Republicans who have split with Trump, even when they agree with his policies.', '“It’s not because of policy issues,” Sanders said. “It is because they understand that Trump is an authoritarian, does not believe in the rule of law, and for one hundred reasons is unfit to be president of the United States.”', 'The unofficial guide to official Washington, every morning and weekday afternoons.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'By signing up, you acknowledge and agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) tried to clean up former President Donald Trump’s disturbing comments about his domestic political opponents being “the enemy within.”', 'In interviews with CNN’s Jake Tapper and NBC’s Kristen Welker, Vance tried to downplay, dismiss, and alter Trump’s repeated characterizations of Democrats as “evil,” “dangerous,” and “enemies.”', 'Trump has made such comments multiple times. Earlier this month, he told Fox host Maria Bartiromo, “We have the outside enemy and then we have the enemy from within—and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all these countries.” Trump added that he considers California Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff among those enemies. And in a podcast interview with Joe Rogan on Friday, Trump said the “enemy from within” was more dangerous than North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.', 'Tapper, host of CNN’s State of the Union, pressed Vance on those comments from the very start of their interview, as well as John Kelly’s characterization this week of Trump as a fascist who admires Hitler. Vance said Kelly’s comments about Trump were inaccurate. At one point, Vance said, “I believe Donald Trump is the candidate of peace.” Later in the interview, Vance said Trump was reserving his threats to send the military after “people rioting after the election” rather than all Americans.', 'TAPPER: ""He wants to use the military to go after the enemy within.""\n\nVANCE: ""There\'s the game that you\'re playing.""\n\nTAPPER: ""I’m not playing a game."" pic.twitter.com/rvb6GgC3BA', 'At another point, Tapper reminded Vance that Trump shared a social media post saying Liz Cheney—now among the Republicans campaigning for his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris—should be put before a war tribunal. “None of that sounds fascistic to you at all?” Tapper asked. “No, of course it doesn’t,” Vance responded, before alleging Tapper was taking Trump’s statements out of context.', '.@jaketapper: ""Liz Cheney, [Trump] said, should be put before a war tribunal.

While she didn’t ask specifically about his response to Trump’s comments about “the enemy from within,” Brennan did ask Vance, “What price should Moscow pay for trying to manipulate American voters?”—referring to a Friday announcement by the FBI that Russia was behind a fake video of mail-in ballots being destroyed in Pennsylvania.', '“A lot of countries are going to try to manipulate our voters. They’re going to try to manipulate our elections. That’s what they do,” Vance replied.

Vance takes on clean-up duty for Trump: From the Politics Desk,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/vance-clean-up-duty-trump-politics-desk-rcna176929,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.', ""In today’s edition, senior national political reporter Henry Gomez and campaign embed Alec Hernández explore how JD Vance often steps in to attempt to explain Donald Trump's controversial remarks. Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd digs into the closing messages from Trump and Kamala Harris."", 'Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.', 'JD Vance’s willingness to regularly take questions from mainstream news outlets has added an unofficial duty to his role as Donald Trump’s running mate: explainer-in-chief.', 'In interviews, at news conferences and while speaking with reporters on his campaign plane, Vance often finds himself having to defend, decode or “well, actually” whatever provocative comment Trump made most recently.', ' That time Trump questioned whether Vice President Kamala Harris is really Black? “I think he pointed out the fundamental chameleon-like nature of Kamala Harris,” Vance contended.', 'When Trump disparaged Detroit, a majority-Black city in battleground Michigan? Trump, Vance said, “was just talking honestly about the fact that Detroit has been left behind.”', 'And when Trump name-dropped a Democratic congressman when he warned about an “enemy within” and stoked fears of chaos justifying military intervention on Election Day? “The enemy within,” Vance offered, “are people that Kamala Harris let into this country unvetted, unchecked and undocumented.”', 'All Republicans — from top Trump surrogates to down-ballot candidates in local races — are inevitably forced to answer for Trump’s most inflammatory rhetoric. Many GOP members of Congress have made a ritual in recent years out of sidestepping questions about his latest outbursts, claiming not to be aware of what he said.', 'But Vance is, after Trump, the campaign’s most prominent player. His willingness to Trump-splain follows a well-documented conversion from Trump critic to loyalist. Eight years ago, he was a bestselling memoirist frequently called on to analyze — and lament — Trump’s appeal to voters in distressed manufacturing towns like the one he grew up in.', 'Today, it often falls to Vance to explain what Trump actually means, as he sees it — or to put a finer point on something shocking or puzzling that Trump has said while, above all else, never deviating from the Trump ethos of never apologizing.', 'Read more →', 'Kamala Harris, her campaign team and some of Donald Trump’s own allies say they expect the former president to quickly declare victory on election night — even if the outcome is not yet settled in key swing states.', 'Between the time it takes to process mail ballots and deal with provisional ballots in some battleground states, votes will not be fully tabulated on election night. Projections of who won a close presidential race might not come for days, similar to the 2020 election. ', 'NBC News spoke to four Trump allies, all of whom speculated that the former president may be prepared to pull a repeat of 2020 and quickly declare he is the victor on election night when that is not yet certain. The sources all noted they did not have direct knowledge that this was a formal Trump campaign plan.', 'Others noted that this November could be different because he is surrounded by a new slate of top aides who wouldn’t push him to make such a declaration.', 'Seven Harris aides — and the vice president herself — said they are making preparations if Trump does indeed prematurely say he won or if he legally challenges the results if he loses. ', '“Of course,” Harris told NBC News in an interview Tuesday when asked if her campaign is preparing to deal with Trump declaring an early victory. “This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked.” ', 'Read more →', 'Given the tumultuous nature of the Trump era in general and the twists and turns that of the 2024 campaign specifically, it’s hard to believe we are most likely at the endgame of this historic election cycle and (knock on wood) it’s ending more normally than any campaign featuring Donald Trump has ended so far.', 'I accept that the phrase “so far” is doing a lot of work in the above paragraph — and to be clear, I’m talking about campaign-shaking events, not Trump’s penchant for crude or uncomfortable remarks. Clearly, something unforeseen can still happen, but I’m not sure we’ll have any new event that would dramatically affect either candidate’s vote share in this late stage of the race. But if you aren’t prepared for the unexpected in politics anymore, then you haven’t been paying attention! ', 'But what has been different — so far! — about this campaign in these last few weeks is how semi-, sorta, kinda conventionally both campaigns are behaving. ', 'For one thing, the campaigns appear to agree on who the final persuadable voter is: a Republican or Republican-leaning independent who doesn’t like Trump personally but is skeptical of Kamala Harris’ perceived liberal politics.', 'Both campaigns are messaging to this voter, with Trump going hard negative on Harris’ politics, hoping to convince these voters that she’s really a San Francisco liberal hiding in moderate clothing. Meanwhile, Harris is going hard negative at Trump on character and democracy, hoping to convince these voters that he’s out for himself at their potential expense, that he’s mentally off and that his inability to control his own id is a potential threat to the country.', 'Given how oddly the final days of the 2016 and 2020 races ended, this 2024 endgame does feel downright conventional. This campaign feels a bit more like a pre-Trump-era closely contested race. It’s less a battle to turn out the bases (though that matters a lot) and more a battle to persuade the skeptical undecideds, because even if the undecideds are a small group, they will be decisive.', 'Read more from Chuck →', '🗓️ Mark your calendar: As part of her closing argument, Harris plans to deliver a speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, four sources familiar with the preparations confirmed to NBC News.', 'That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

JD Vance (R-OH) battled Sunday morning in a marathon brawl about former President Donald Trump’s “enemy within” rhetoric, the claims of Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, and a host of other topics.', 'In a heated confrontation on CNN’s State of the Union, Tapper — right out of the box — grilled the Republican VP candidate about what Kelly has said about Trump. The former Trump chief of staff told The Atlantic that Trump praised Adolf Hitler, and told The New York Times that Trump meets the definition of a fascist.', 'Vance argued that Kelly’s criticism of Trump is rooted in an unspoken agenda.', '“If you actually look at John Kelly, at folks like Liz Cheney, the fundamental disagreement they have with Donald Trump is even though they say that they’re conservative, they’re conservative in the sense that they want America to get involved in a ton of ridiculous military conflicts,” Vance said. “They want America to police the world. And Donald Trump doesn’t.”', 'Tapper pointed out that Kelly had a son killed in combat in Afghanistan and has never voiced his opinion about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.', '“You’re acting as if he is pro-war,” Tapper said. He added, “He was a general carrying out orders.”', '“I know John Kelly’s worldview and I know the people who have attacked Donald Trump the most vociferously on foreign policy,” Vance said. “They’ll say, ‘well, he’s a dictator’ when what they really mean is they won’t listen. Donald Trump wouldn’t listen to the leadership of the military when they wanted him to start ridiculous conflicts. That is a consistent theme.”', 'Tapper went on to press Vance’s claim that Kelly colluded with the Kamala Harris campaign ahead of his latest interview.', '“I’ve spoken with people in John Kelly’s circle, and I’ve spoken with people in the Kamala Harris campaign,” Tapper said. They say there’s been no communication the entire time. So where did that come from?”', '“I’m highly skeptical of that, Jake,” Vance replied. “You know the way that these attacks work. You know the way that these people are often vetted by a campaign before something goes out there.”', '“So you made it up,” Tapper said.', '“No,” Vance responded. “I said that the American media and the American Democratic Party apparatus works a certain way.”', 'Vance went on to lump Kelly in with other Trump critics who take issue with his foreign policy positions. But Tapper made clear he was asking about criticism from other ex-Trump officials like former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and former Vice President Mike Pence.', '“One reason why Kamala Harris doesn’t have as many people criticizing her is because she doesn’t fire people who fail,” Vance said — leaving out that Harris does not presently have the authority to hire and fire cabinet officials. The senator added, “Kamala Harris protects failures in government. Donald Trump fires them. And I’d much rather have the president who fires people who screw up.”', '“He did not fire Mike Pence!” Tapper said. “He did not fire Mark Milley!”', '“He fired a lot of those people,” Vance said. He added, “We’ve now spent five minutes talking about people in Donald Trump’s staff who—”', '“Think he’s not fit for office,” Tapper said, interjecting.', '“They didn’t think he was unfit for office until they had a falling out with them because he fired them,” Vance said. “And we’re not talking about the public policy.”', 'From there, Tapper shifted gears to Trump’s “enemy within” rhetoric. The CNN anchor quoted Trump’s comments to Joe Rogan Friday when he said, “we have people that are really bad, people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful. That’s the enemy within.” Vance argued Tapper was taking Trump out of context.', '“That’s the game that you’re playing?” Vance said.', '“I’m not playing a game!” Tapper shot back.', '“He said that he wanted to use the military to go after far left lunatics who are rioting,” Vance said. “And he also called them. He also called them the enemy within. He separately, in a totally different context and a totally different conversation, said that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were threats to this country.”', '“Were the enemy within!” Tapper clarified. “He said they were the enemy within!”', 'The two went back-and-forth over the context of Trump’s comments — and Tapper called Vance out for trying to give a very “narrow definition” of the remarks.', '“Now you’re giving a very narrow definition of what he said, which is not what he said!” Tapper told Vance. “That’s not what he said.”', 'We’ll have further coverage of this stunning marathon interview.

Trump\'s running mate has said he changed his mind during the former president\'s term in office.', 'Trump has also cited the possibility of using the military to address ""the enemy from within,"" a term he\'s used broadly in recent weeks in reference to people from violent protesters to prominent Democratic officials and others.', 'On CNN, Vance said Trump was referring to ""far left lunatics"" who ""burn down our cities"" and denied that the former president would try to use force against individuals like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.', '""What he said, and I do agree with this – what he said is that the biggest threat we have in our country, it’s not a foreign adversary, because we can handle these guys. We can handle foreign conflicts” he added on NBC\'s ""Meet The Press.""', 'Vance called political threats on the left a bigger threat than foreign adversaries. He cited Harris and Pelosi on issues like regression of the U.S. industrial base and border security.', '""The fact that Americans have a wide-open southern border, that\'s a way bigger threat than any foreign threat,"" Vance said on NBC. ""And, yes, it\'s caused by broken leadership.""', 'Polls show a deadlocked race, although they also show a major gender gap among voters.', ""In the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University national poll, women backed Harris, 53% to 36%. That's a mirror image of men's overwhelming support for Trump, 53% to 37%. If those margins hold until Election Day, it would be the biggest disparity since a gender gap emerged more than four decades ago, in 1980."", 'Vance told CBS on Sunday he does not believe that Republicans have a ""women problem,"" and their domestic and foreign policies are better for all Americans, regardless of gender.', '""We have to make our best case to women and to men as well as we can,"" Vance said.', 'Abortion rights have been one of the central issues of the 2024 race for the White House. Other reproductive rights, such as in vitro fertilization access, have also been top of mind for voters across the country in the first presidential election since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade.', ""While Harris laid out specific policies in an appeal to male voters, but it's not clear how effective the proposals have been as Trump has made inroads with men, particularly Black and Latino men."", 'Vance sat for the string of interviews amid news that Russia is again interfering in the election via false statements and fake photos on the Internet.', 'For example, the FBI and the director of national intelligence announced Friday that Russia is behind a fake video that shows some ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.', 'Vance during his appearance on ""Meet the Press"" declined to call Russian President Vladimir Putin an ""enemy"" of the United States, instead saying “I think that he’s clearly an adversary. He is a competitor.”', '“But I think that we also have to be smart about diplomacy, too,” Vance added “Just because we don’t like somebody, doesn’t mean that we can’t occasionally engage in conversations with them.""', 'Vance\'s response comes as the Republican ticket has spent months criticizing NATO. Trump earlier this year said he might not come to the aid of European nations if they\'re attacked by Russia − and might even ""encourage"" Russians ""to do whatever the hell they want"" if those countries aren\'t meeting their financial commitments to the defense alliance.', ""Vance also said sanctions against Russia have been ineffective, but he didn't specify how a potential Trump-Vance administration would change them."", '""What we should do is encourage our fellow Americans to be careful,"" Vance said on CBS. ""Don\'t trust everything that you see on social media. And of course, we should push back where appropriate.""', 'The latter is a big question, he added: ""What is an appropriate response to a country making social media videos? I\'m not going to make a commitment to that sitting right here.""']"

Watch: JD Vance Defends Trump’s Alarming Comments on Military Hit List,https://www.yahoo.com/news/watch-jd-vance-defends-trump-201216090.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'JD Vance offered a strange defense Monday morning of Donald Trump’s recent comments calling Democrats and his other political opponents the “enemy within,” saying Trump’s words are “unfiltered” and “from the heart.”', 'Fox’s Bill Hemmer asked Vance what the former president means when he uses the phrase and why such language is necessary. Vance responded dismissively, claiming that Trump was just being himself.', '“Donald Trump is unfiltered,” Vance told Hemmer. “I think this is one of the reasons why the campaign has gone well, is because he’s not doing a basement campaign strategy. He’s not just running on slogans. When people ask him questions, he speaks from the heart.”', 'Vance then claimed Trump’s comments on using the military against his enemies were actually in regard to the “rioters” protesting for racial justice during the summer of 2020.', '“Why wasn’t law enforcement empowered to put down these riots, to reimpose law and order on American cities? That’s to me what President Trump is talking about here,” Vance said, claiming that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz encouraged “rioters” to attack police stations back then.', 'Hemmer then corrected Vance, pointing out that Trump specifically mentioned Representatives Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi by name. The Republican vice presidential candidate quickly pivoted, accusing Schiff and Pelosi of being “really part of weaponizing the Department of Justice against our country.”', '“I think what Donald Trump is saying is, ‘Look, we’ve got the strongest country in the world. We’ve got the best people in the world, but we do have some broken leadership,’” Vance said, accusing Pelosi of “getting rich off of insider stock trades even as her own country has gotten poor.”', '“We do have people on the left, not most people to be clear, but some people on the left who are encouraging violent responses to what we believe is going to be a Donald Trump victory in a couple of weeks,” Vance added. “That’s not okay, and I think it’s totally reasonable to point out that yes, we’ve got the strongest country in the world, but we do have some broken leaders in Washington, and it’s why we’re [winning] this race.”', 'Vance is clearly doing his best to spin and add some depth to Trump’s comments to make them appear reasonable, trying to sanewash what clearly is the former president characterizing his political opponents as national enemies that he plans to target if he returns to the White House. The Ohio senator also is trying to redirect the very real threat of Trump supporters resorting to violence if the former president loses in November by accusing liberals of the same thing, even though the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots have not faded from public memory.', 'Vance is only the latest Republican to dismiss Trump’s violent rhetoric, but others in the GOP were not able to invent such a detailed explanation. Meanwhile, ex-officials from the Trump administration, including his former secretary of defense Mark Esper, think the former president’s comments are alarming and should be taken very seriously.']"
