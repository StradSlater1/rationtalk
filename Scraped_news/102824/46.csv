WWE NXT Halloween Havoc 2024: 3 Things We Hated And 3 Things We Loved,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1698701/wwe-nxt-halloween-havoc-2024-3-things-we-hated-3-things-we-loved/,"['', 'Welcome to Wrestling Inc.\'s possibly annual (?) review of ""WWE NXT"" Halloween Havoc 2024, which was a PLE this year even though it wasn\'t last year because reasons! This ... was a bit of an uneven one, folks. It gives the WINC staff no pleasure to inform you that things we love were difficult to come by on this show, which is why the moments we\'ve singled out for praise in this column are mostly smaller and less momentous than usual. As for the thing we hated ... well, we\'ll get to them, but let\'s just say we were spoilt for choice.', 'All this having been said, we actually are going to cover most of the five-match card, from Giulia and Stephanie Vaquer\'s tag team win to the Ambulance Match to the Gauntlet Match to the main event, and all that followed it. The one thing we\'re not really going to talk about is Tony D\'Angelo stacking up a second win against Oba Femi, which we generally thought was fine and which you can read about by checking out our Halloween Havoc results page. Beyond that match, however, we have strong feelings about pretty much everything, so here are three things we hated and three things we loved (or maybe three tricks and three treats) about ""WWE NXT"" Halloween Havoc 2024!', '', 'With a Heritage Cup Match set for Tuesday\'s episode of ""WWE NXT,"" Lexis King\'s search for a cornerman hadn\'t yielded any viable candidates until a backstage segment at Halloween Havoc featured the return of a familiar face in William Regal, who offered his services to King against none other than Regal\'s own son Charlie Dempsey. Of late, King has more openly referred to his father, the late Brian Pillman, and perhaps the connection with Regal will begin to push him back toward embracing his heritage as Brian Pillman Jr.', 'Since Regal\'s return to WWE in January, on-screen appearances have been of a cameo nature and few and far between, announcing Dempsey\'s All Japan Pro Wrestling appearances earlier this year, appointing Ava as ""NXT"" General Manager, congratulating Dempsey on winning The Heritage Cup at Roadblock, and showing up alongside Giulia when she was first shown on WWE television at Stand and Deliver. Now, it appears as though he\'ll at least be a trigger point in changing the direction of not one but two up-and-coming talents.', 'Inserting Regal into a feud centered around The Heritage Cup can only be a good thing since that\'s been a bit dry in general since its inception, in my opinion, and he can bring some color to it all, but to do so while Dempsey is an integral part of the storyline is even better. Add to that the fact that King is the adversary, and the previous connections between Regal and the elder Pillman, and this has the makings of, well, several different potentially satisfying end results. Outside of The Heritage Cup, it\'s no stretch at all to say that both Dempsey and King could use a little more oomph to their respective directions anyway and who better to do just that than ""The Gentleman Villain?"" Heel turns, character shifts, double-crosses and so much else, it seems, may be right around the corner.', 'Written by Jon Jordan', '', 'To be clear: The ""NXT"" women\'s division is the best thing on the show and has been for years now. The arrivals of Stephanie Vaquer and Giulia have been by far the most exciting thing the brand has going for it, and it\'s hard to remember the last time a Roxanne Perez PLE match wasn\'t match of the night, as it was again on Sunday. Trick Williams is great and he\'s super popular, but these three women are undeniably the primary drivers of buzz for ""NXT\'s current incarnation. And Cora Jade is here, too! So why did the big Perez & Jade vs. Vaquer and Giulia match seem to mean so little in the broader context of Halloween Havoc?', ""In general, you don't put any of your biggest matches in the second spot on the show. The opener is a big deal, the main event is a big deal, and you can usually drop a big match somewhere near the middle, but the second match? Generally not a prominent spot. Also, while the match was good, it was also pretty basic in terms of how the finish set things up going forward. Vaquer pinned Perez, so that's a title match we're probably getting, but that's also a title match we were always getting. Beyond that, all we got in terms of tangible storytelling was Zaria showing up to stare at the winners — and then she showed up again later and did significantly more than stare at Fallon Henley."", ""No matter how talented the wrestlers involved might be, it's up to the promotion and the booker to make a match feel truly special. This felt the one way I didn't expect a match involving Vaquer, Giulia, and Perez to feel: routine."", 'Written by Miles Schneiderman', '', ""Even though this stipulation wasn't set up with a fun wheel spin, it was made official following an intense video package exchange where Ridge Holland challenged Andre Chase to an ambulance match, so that's still okay in my book. As commentary kept mentioning, this was apparently only the seventh ambulance match in WWE history, and I'm a sucker for a good gimmick match. This was a feud where an ambulance match made a ton of sense, with Holland sending Chase and Duke Hudson out of arenas in an ambulance. And tonight, he did it once again to Mr. Chase, seemingly ending their blood feud for good, as we'd see what's next for Holland later on in the night."", ""The match itself was pretty good, albeit a bit slow, but not drawn out too long, from the showcase of Holland's athleticism, to the various weapons used like kendo sticks and the gurney from inside the ambulance. I thought it was also placed very well on a well-paced card. No one from Chase U got involved, which I thought was interesting, but I didn't hate, though I might have missed something where they were banned from ringside. I think the best thing to come out of this match wasn't any kind of crazy memorable spot (we really only got Chase cannonballing off the top of the ambulance), but rather, what it means for Chase U and its storyline moving forward, now that we know Holland is done with them."", 'Andre Chase has been through a lot over the past year, from almost losing the university, to almost losing Thea Hail when gambling on her abilities, to being taken out of an arena not once, but twice in an ambulance, after letting an outsider into their group. This has to mean something for Chase U and the story going forward, and I\'m excited to see what that is. Is this the end of Chase U? Will someone new take over as the leader, maybe Hudson? Well anyone even feel sorry for Chase after he accepted this match? There\'s not much that Chase U can do on ""NXT"" that gets me interested or excited anymore, but a dissolution storyline where everyone, especially Hudson and Hail, go off on their own to be successful is something I\'d like to see.', 'Written by Daisy Ruth', '', ""While this headline may or may not also be my life's mantra, in this case, I'm speaking specifically about Kelani Jordan, who was protected in defeat by the fact that the she had to take on all of Fatal Influence in a gauntlet match (as announced on the preshow). So, in the longrun, she's going to be just fine. Still, she didn't win. And neither did Fallon Henley, despite the fact that she came away with the NXT Women's North American Championship, first on account of the fact that it took her being the third leg of said gauntlet, second as she needed help from her other two stablemates during her segment of the match to get the pinfall, and third as she, and all of Fatal Influence, were simply decimated by a debuting (for real this time) Zaria."", 'We can take a little bit of a moral victory from the fact that the former Delta\'s third in-person appearance in ""NXT"" was at least more than just staring at people (and that F5 she hit was pretty cool) but even Zaria seemingly takes a small step down the ladder from what appeared to be having a spot in the main event picture right out of the gate only an hour or so before (when she stared down all of Giulia, Stephanie Vaquer, Cora Jade, and NXT Women\'s Champion Roxanne Perez). She, too, will be alright, as her in-ring debut come Tuesday will surely showcase more of what she can do, and maybe result in another face-to-face with Fatal Influence before she re-engages with the main event ladies, but let\'s get back to the faction at hand here.', ""Where do they go from here? Okay, Henley's got a title, and one with a measure of prestige at that, becoming only the second ever to hold the Women's North American Championship. But she and her homies all got shellacked moments afterwards. I don't think they're getting any revenge on Zaria, so they all just come off as less-than. And that stinks. But it just goes to show you, once again, no one wins when (a) Jordan loses."", 'Written by Jon Jordan', '', 'This may seem a little silly, but Tatum Paxley appearing, scaring Booker T, and really keeping the havoc of Halloween Havoc going in to ""NXT"" on Tuesday was a cute little addition for me. Paxley and her nemesis Wendy Choo (who I have started calling ""Nightmare"" Choo in her current character iteration of a sleep paralysis demon or whatever she has going on, considering that wasn\'t really ever explained) were two of the ""spooky,"" weird characters on ""NXT"" that weren\'t featured on Halloween Havoc, and this was a perfect way to further things for them. I had honestly forgotten they were still feuding for a moment there, as I don\'t remember anything too interesting happening between the pair on the leadup to this show, but if they weren\'t going to be wrestling on it, I rather things have played out the way they did.', 'Paxley just kind of appeared out of a box while Booker T was explaining the rules of a Devil\'s Playground match and wandering the set pieces, and General Manager Ava rushed out to attempt to get Paxley some help with the medical team. Paxley explained she needed a match with Choo, to which Ava agreed for ""NXT,"" then without warning, Paxley spun the Halloween Havoc wheel to make things more interesting. The wheel landed on a coffin match for Tuesday, and I\'m all for exciting things like stipulation matches getting added to ""NXT"" episodes before the fact to spice things up.', 'The havoc of Halloween will continue this week on ""NXT"" in a pretty perfect way. A coffin match seems like a good stipulation between these two characters, and it is still right before Halloween. I\'m hoping Paxley comes out victorious and Choo turns back into her old character, or something a little different than what she\'s working with now, but I guess we\'ll have to wait and see. Overall, this was simple, but very effective for me tonight.', 'Written by Daisy Ruth', '', 'There is a lot going right for ""WWE NXT"" at the moment with a stacked roster of young stars including Oba Femi, Giulia, Stephanie Vaquer, Kelani Jordan, and many more it feels criminal not to mention. For a time there has also been a well-balanced cycle of main roster veterans coming down to the brand to bridge the gap for the prospects, so for the love of everything on this wonderful planet, why would you have the main event of a PPV close with a 53-year-old Bubba Ray Dudley?', 'Trick Williams overcame Ethan Page in the Devil\'s Playground rubber match for the NXT Championship, a violent and bump-filled affair that saw the defending champion undertake a Herculean feat of resilience — almost unrealistically so, if we\'re being cynical — but found his celebration cut short by the fallen challenger and an emerging Ridge Holland. Holland had beaten Andre Chase earlier in the night in an Ambulance Match, but I\'ll be honest and say it wasn\'t him I was hoping to make a return in this spot; my sentimental pick would have been Femi, having lost his North American title feud with Tony D\'Angelo earlier. Nevertheless, surely this was the time to truly cement Holland in the role as next challenger? Evidently not, it would seem, as he was briefly relegated to taking orders from Page, only for their attack to be interrupted by Bubba Ray because Holland had disrespected him twice throughout the night. Because the one thing ""WWE NXT"" needs at this time is a feud between them.', ""I don't understand why the decision was made to have Page and Holland demean themselves in the eyes of the viewer by running away from a single semi-retired wrestler, especially if the idea is that Holland is some dangerous monster and considering that Page had just lost a match where he threw everything under the kitchen sink at his opponent. Nor does it really benefit Williams to have to be saved by the WWE Hall of Famer. There are a number of babyfaces who could have put in that position, even main roster stars if the payoff for this is really supposed to be a tag match of some form (Because in 2024 who really wants to see Bubba Ray return to the ring?). But to rely on someone better known for their opinions on wrestling as opposed to their in-ring product over recent years in a developmental territory really just feels like a backwards methodology — but that could just be me."", 'Written by Max Everett', '', '', '', '', '']"

One particular line detailed an honor Trick’s yet to experience: how it feels when someone tastes their own blood. If promo’s are thesis papers, that was his thesis statement. Trick isn’t tough enough because he hasn’t experienced true physical sacrifice. The usual tough man macho bs that actually carries weight in wrestling because it’s true. In a battle between someone with noticeable battle scars and someone without any, the former has the advantage. This was the match, narratively, where Trick Willy Wonka baptized himself with fire and came out stronger on the other side.', 'That played out during one pivotal moment where things became extra devilish. Ethan needed to turn the tables—no pun—when Trick looked strong. All Ego dodged a bullet after surviving the Trick Knee on what was supposed to be a kickout but ended up being a rope break. Yup, a rope break in a match where everything is legal. On the one hand, it was clearly a mistake but on the other, I don’t like the idea of kicking out of the Trick Knee, so it kinda worked even though it was a no-no. Anyway. Ethan took that breather to grab some steel steps and ram Trick into the sharpest, pointiest edge. That’s when Trick finally tasted his own blood.', 'We got an awesome visual of Ethan smiling like a kid on Christmas morning while blood curdled from the champ’s mouth. Then it went into overdrive when Ethan put that man in the Ego’s Edge through the announce table. Blood dropped from Trick’s mouth while the ref asked for help.', ""@_trickwilliams is being pushed to the limit, but he's fighting through the pain!#HalloweenHavoc pic.twitter.com/UytZLqrnBy"", 'Narratively, this was the moment Trick solidified his toughness. He fought the odds and the odds didn’t win. That put Ethan on his heels until a timely low blow came after Trick not only hit the man with a Rock Bottom on steel steps, but didn’t truly put him away. It’s one thing to drop a man on his back across steel but it’s another to take that steel and truly use it as a weapon. Trick didn’t but Ethan showed he would:', ""What a gutsy performance from @_trickwilliams!\n\nHe survives the Devil's Playground! #HalloweenHavoc pic.twitter.com/SolUfsCeux"", 'And that was all she wrote. I’d say it was a fitting end to this feud but it’s not quite over yet. The Bubba Ray Dudley save came after Ridge Holland disrespected him not once but twice during Halloween Havoc. Bubba & Trick vs. Ethan & Ridge at the ECW arena sounds fine although Ridge seems very out of the blue here. They needed to get to the tag match but him attacking Trick as part of him getting his Gambit on doesn’t work for me as an isolated incident. Luckily for them, this is anything but.', 'I wanted more from a match designed to make Trick tougher but I’m not mad at what we got. They told a fine story that got them over the hump.

He came out with glorious purpose, intent on getting revenge for his family and putting to rest any rumors that his win against Oba Femi was fugazi. Which had more importance for the Don?', 'It was clearly the former as the match played out. It was beautiful violence built on Oba’s comeback and just unleashing hell on the North American champ. And that’s the right move for this match. Giving Tony the early advantage only for Oba to, well, be Oba works in everyone’s favor. The former champ is built for a match where anything goes and it puts tons of sympathy on Tony D’s shoulders. That, combined with Oba’s recent devilish actions against The Family put the Ruler in prime position for an L, regardless of how he caught it.', 'So when Stacks, Rizzo, and Luca Crusifino showed up, I knew it was for some get back, not because Tony needed their help.

Sure, Stephanie Vaquer & Giulia won, but I figured Roxanne Perez & Cora Jade might overreach with their villainy, thus creating an opening for the win. Instead, we got a straightforward battle between two teams with something to prove. Cora & Roxanne truly believe they’re better than their opponents, so, yeah in retrospect, I made the wrong call. Any match that starts with a test of strength shows its hand early and it built from there. This is my match of the night because of that escalation. It went from small moves and quick tags to big moves and several near falls. They made this match all about the suspense. The match effectively put Roxanne & Cora on Stephanie & Giulia’s level, while giving Giulia the necessary win over the champ.', 'Loved this match, loved the ending, and looking forward to more.', 'To borrow a phrase from a colleague, this was a B + show.

Out next is Andre Chase, and a vintage Ambulance is set up on stage. We\'re reminded that the only way to win this match is to put your opponent in the rear of the ambulance and close the door. Chase gets a decent reaction, wearing a Freddy Kruger-themed Chase U sweater out. We get announcements ahead before our bell at 8:08pm. Chase starts off aggressive, getting the first several licks in as the action wastes no time spilling outside. Ridge and Andre battle up the ramp, with Holland at one point attempting to Lawn Dart (throw) Chase at the ambulance. Holland removes the ambulance\'s gurney/stretcher and throws Chase in, but can\'t close the door as Chase starts to thrash and fight back. Chase uses a fire extinguisher to spray Holland in the face. Chase begins to take the upper hand, but Holland shuts that shit down with a snap belly-to-belly suplex on the entrance ramp. Holland uses the stretcher to ram Chase and run him over. Chase rallies and uses the stretcher as a stepping-point to cross from the ring to Holland, dropping him. The crowd chants ""we want buckets."" At least, that\'s what I think they\'re saying. The action returns to the ring and Holland takes control.\nThe pace slows as Holland spends several agonizing moments dominating Chase. The crowd finally wakes up as Andre Chase manages to escape, and both men quickly attack each other with kendo sticks. Chase drops Holland twice, then does his C-H-A-S-E U kicks to a good reaction. Chase climbs the turnbuckles and hits a crossbody off the top, dropping Holland. Chase uses a steel chair to strike Holland in the back. The commentary team seem far more hyped about this match than anyone else. Chase follows Holland outside, only to walk into a scoop slam. Holland pulls back a strip of padding, exposing the floor, and calls for a bomb move. Chase counters, back-flipping Holland down onto the exposed concrete to a great pop. Chase uses the stretcher as a ram and runs over Holland, much as Ridge had done to Andre earlier. Chase uses the stretcher as a ram again and again, then begins to clear the commentary table to a huge pop. Holland looks to stop Chase, but after a brief struggle, Andre gains the upper hand and drives Ridge into the table. The crowd pops ""one more time"" but commentary speculate that Holland is out.\nChase loads Ridge onto the stretcher and begins to wheel him around the ring, towards the ramp. Holland falls off so Chase pulls him up, leading him towards the stretcher. Holland recovers--clearly playing possum--and whips Chase into the steel steps. Holland loads Chase up onto the stretcher and begins to wheel it up the ramp, towards the ambulance. Ridge shoves Chase towards the ambulance\'s rear open hatch, then Holland unloads fists into Andre\'s head. Holland retrieves a pumpkin to a huge pop (what?) but Chase recovers, using the back board to strike Holland. Chase uses a pumpkin to attack the downed Holland, then climbs the top of the ambulance. Chase dives off, hitting a buster, then throws Holland into the ambulance. Holland tries to fight the door closure, eventually raking at Chase\'s eye and allowing himself to escape. Chase slams the rear hatch door into Chase\'s face, then positions Chase under the opened door. Holland hits a guillotine slingshot, slinging Chase up into the ambulance door! Chase eats a Redeemer DDT from Holland on the ramp. Holland throws Chase into the ambulance and slams it shut at 8;23pm, picking up the win to a chorus of boos.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

D\'Angelo took on the longest reigning North American Champion, Oba Femi, in a rematch with TLC rules, but one man had to pin the other to win. It was a big battle back-and-forth with weapons, and D\'Angelo sent Femi through the ring barricade almost right out of the gate, on a mission to retain his gold. D\'Angelo also set up a ladder between the ring apron to the announcer\'s desk, which would come into play later in the match.', 'At one point, D\'Angelo went down and grabbed his knee like he was injured after falling out of an attempted slam by Femi. While ""The Don"" was vulnerable, Femi took the opportunity to use zip ties to attach him to the bottom rope. The rest of the D\'Angelo Family ran down the ramp, but Femi took them out. Adriana Rizzo attempted to untie D\'Angelo, but Femi cornered her to the ropes, then outside of the ring, where she armed herself with a crow bar.', 'During that time, D\'Angelo was able to get himself out of the zip ties and speared Femi through the ropes, and they both went through the ladder set up at the beginning of the bout.

Who Will Win At NXT Halloween Havoc 2024?

As always, that means we have one last chance to break down the card and give our predictions for all the matches scheduled for the premium live event.', 'My question for you today is “Who do you think will win at NXT Halloween Havoc?”', 'Remember to answer with your response in the comments below.', 'Spinner’s Choice TBD Match for the NXT Women’s North American Championship: Kelani Jordan (c) vs. Fallon Henley, Jacy Jayne, or Jazmyn Nyx', 'That whole debut for Zaria interrupting this sure was weird, wasn’t it? Spinner’s Choice for this is so dumb. Why is the entire gimmick for Fatal Influence just that they perpetually get put in matches where we don’t know who is going to wrestle, but it ultimately doesn’t matter in the grand scheme anyway?', 'Given how two of the three matches on this card are just No DQ with a different name, I’m not expecting much here. The gimmick will either be a 3-on-1 handicap match or another renamed No DQ match (like Trick or Street Fight) where the others join in on the one who is chosen to wrestle and it becomes Kelani Jordan fighting against the numbers game anyway.', 'Another issue with this that I have is that this clearly won’t be Nyx, but if Henley or Jayne were to win, they would end up being effectively declared the leader of the group. It’s always struck me that both of them are on an equal playing field, with Nyx as their underling. I could see either of them winning the title, but that’s a conundrum, along with how any of this has anything to do with Zaria.', 'Then again, does Zaria coming out have anything to do with them, period? Or was she out there to try to signal that she’s going to be involved more so with Giulia and Stephanie Vaquer? That ending to NXT was supposed to be mysterious, and it ended up just being confusing. I hate the unnecessary mystery box strategy. Who booked this, J.J. Abrams?', 'I’ll just go with Fatal Influence winning here unless Zaria is involved. I think I reserve the right to say that WWE has intentionally or unintentionally left this ambiguous enough that having 4 possible winners beyond even the champion leaves room for a bit of an indirect prediction. But if you’re asking me who I think will be in the match on top of that, I think it will be Jayne.', 'Ambulance Match: Andre Chase vs. Ridge Holland', 'Surely this has to be the end of this feud, as there isn’t anything else left for them to do beyond have Thea Hail fight Ridge Holland. But since Holland already took out Chase and everyone else, if he were to do the same here, they’re just running a repeat to get back to the same spot they’ve already been.', 'I’m thinking instead, what will happen is that Chase will have the support of the rest of Chase University, with a returning Duke Hudson and Riley Osborne, as well as Thea Hail getting involved, all ganging up on Holland to send him packing. Then, coming out of this, Holland will be approached by Shawn Spears, who will recruit him to be another one of his allies alongside Brooks Jensen and continue to warp his mind.', 'Tag Team Match: Roxanne Perez and Cora Jade vs. Giulia and Stephanie Vaquer', 'This all hinges on Zaria, again. Also, again, WWE has set up a scenario where eventually, one to two people will have to look less important, unless everyone looks less important than the champion. That is because Giulia already failed to win the title, Vaquer hasn’t had a shot, and Jade is on Perez’s side. Even ignoring Zaria, who could very well be teaming with Perez and Jade to help them get the win, both Giulia and Vaquer can’t be the next champion, nor would I think Jade will be the one to dethrone Perez.', 'If this were closer to NXT Stand & Deliver, I would say that this will lead to a Fatal 4-Way for the title. Technically, that can still happen at something like NXT Deadline, but they haven’t even announced that yet. Plus, the last two years, the women’s title wasn’t even defended at that event, but a No. 1 contender’s Iron Survivor Challenge was the go-to option instead.', 'Does that mean the plan will be to bounce around between these women until Jade, Giulia, Vaquer, and two others (Zaria? Someone from Fatal Influence? Sol Ruca? Nikkita Lyons? Jaida Parker? Lola Vice? Thea Hail? Karmen Petrovic?) will end up being in that match to draw this out?', 'Obviously, saying that this will make obvious sense once we know what their plan is for the rest of November and December as far as title matches is a cop out, but that’s the reality. If the babyfaces win, I think it will set up Vaquer getting a title opportunity. However, if they lose, I think it will be because of Zaria and that will be the roadblock that kills time and stretches out Roxanne’s title reign a bit longer into 2025.', 'As far as my prediction is concerned, I’m going with the babyfaces.', 'Tables, Ladders, and Scares Match for the NXT North American Championship: Tony D’Angelo (c) vs. Oba Femi', 'It is SO dumb that this match is going to end in a pinfall. Not only does that completely defeat the purpose of it being a ladder match (*ahem* Tables, Ladders, and Scares…ugh) but it also means that either Oba Femi suffers a second pinfall instead of being kept looking strong by losing via D’Angelo climbing the ladder and retrieving the title, or the belt is just going back to Femi in a hot potato situation, meaning losing the championship in the first place was a completely unnecessary blow to his perfect record.', 'I don’t like this whatsoever. They should have just kept it a ladder match and had D’Angelo retain that way. With this current setup, I’d rather Femi just win the belt back than to take that second pin, unless it is all three men from The D’Angelo Family ganging up on him to excuse how he was taken out. Even then, I don’t think it would have been necessary to book a rematch and have him lose twice to D’Angelo.', 'Prediction-wise, I’m saying Tony D retains. It wouldn’t shock me if Femi just wins it back, though, to be honest.', 'Devil’s Playground Match for the NXT Championship: Trick Williams (c) vs. Ethan Page', 'This is as standard as it gets. Page hasn’t won a true victory over Williams, but he did take the title off him by pinning someone else. Trick won it back. They’ve stretched this out for quite a while. Now, with the rubber match, it has to end. Trick needs to retain and put Page behind him so he can move on to someone else, which I’d imagine will probably be Wes Lee.', 'What do you think? Drop your thoughts below!', '']"

D’Angelo got a ladder and draped it from the ring to the announce table. The audience chanted “we want tables” as if a table spot will beat anything they’re going to do with a ladder. Femi fought that off for now and a bunch of chairs got tossed into the ring. Femi hit a uranage on D’Angelo on one of the chairs and got a long two. No feeling-out process in this one.', 'Femi went at D’Angelo with chair shots to the midsection. Femi put D into a corner, draped a ladder across the second ropes, and beat D’s head into it. D slipped to his seat and kicked the ladder into Femi for a short reprieve, but Femi went right back at D’Angelo on the outside, then rolled him back inside. Femi laid a ladder from the second buckle to the mat and hit a body slam on D’Angelo across it. Femi got a table and shoved it into the ring.', 'Femi hung the table at a 45 degree angle from the mat to the top turnbuckle. Both guys had near-run-ins with the table and while D’Angelo put on the brakes, Femi used the opening to backsplash D’Angelo into the table. The match got an early “this is awesome” chant, and it’s hard to disagree with this opening six minutes. Femi got D’Angelo’s crowbar and went at him with it, working a crossface with the bar. The ref made no motion that the crowbar isn’t allowed, so this “Tables, Ladders and Scares” match is now officially just a Street Fight. Femi back elbowed D’Angelo to the mat and covered him for two.', 'Femi, frustrated now, put the boots to D’Angelo, then went right back to the crowbar crossface. D’Angelo slowly fought to his feet and backed Femi into the turbuckle, breaking on a second effort, but Femi charged and hit a lariat to the rear side. Femi went for a powerbomb but D’Angelo countered with a back body-drop for his first impact offense in quite a while. D’Angelo went at Femi with a series of chairshots, then hit a belly-to-belly on one and covered for two. D went out and got a second table (it still got a pop, but the first table spot looked so effective it may have diminished this second one). D’Angelo went for a side suplex, maybe, onto the table but Femi reversed and hit an F-5 instead. D’Angelo sold an issue with his knee that looked to be kayfabe.', 'Femi, like he did Tuesday, zip-tied D’Angelo to the ropes. All three other members of the Family charged. Femi easily took out Stacks and Luca Crusifino while Adrianna Rizzo checked on D’Angelo. Femi went into the ring, stalking Rizzo until she went out on the apron and got a crowbar. Femi yanked it away from her, but D’Angelo had broken free and he speared Femi, who was right over the draped ladder from the outset of the match. Back inside, Femi quickly got back into it with a spear and a pop-up powerbomb for a long, believable near-fall. Femi went for another, but all three members of the Family hit the ring. Crowbar shot by Rizzo, Shatter Machine by Stacks & Luca, and finally a slam through the second table finished for D’Angelo. Your babyfaces, ladies and gentlemen!', 'WINNER: Tony D’Angelo at 15:23.', '(Wells’s Analysis: They were kind of backed into a corner with not wanting Femi to take a loss clean, but Femi being booked as a heel as they continue to present the mob as babyfaces. The four of them standing together and posing afterward really drove home that it took all four of them to beat him. On the upside, this was actually an extremely enjoyable street fight with some really hard-hitting spots, which may even qualify as D’Angelo’s most enjoyable singles match to date. It also frees Femi up for a potential run at a bigger fish)', '-There was a long hype video for Cody Rhodes for Peacock Premium subscribers.', '-Sarah Schreiber interviewed Lexis King about whether he had found a corner man for his Heritage Cup championship match on Tuesday. He said he was facing constant rejection and ghosted texts. He said he was trying to change his perception. William Regal stepped into the frame and said he’d be the corner man. He said sometimes the apple falls far from the tree. Well, that’s certainly interesting.', '-Earlier tonight, Fatal Influence chose the Gauntlet Match as their stipulation. Order of opponents will be Jazmyn Nyx, then Jacy Jayne, then Fallon Henley. No surprises there, as Fallon is the frontwoman and the most polished product of the three.', '(2) GIULIA & STEPHANIE VAQUER vs. ROXANNE PEREZ & CORA JADE', 'I know they never put a non-championship match on last, but given the hype for the new babyfaces, I could’ve seen an argument for it here. The heels were wearing matching blue and white plaid on their gear, somewhat evoking Judy Garland’s dress in The Wizard of Oz. Vaquer had on green gear for the first time in this company and half of her face was painted for the Day of the Dead. She had the rose crown as well. Giulia had spiderwebs painted around her eyes.', 'Vaquer and Jade had a grappling sequence to open. Vaquer shoved Jade to the face corner and tagged Giulia, who continued work on Jade’s arm. She shoved Jade into the buckle and again tagged, but Jade was able to scamper to her own tag. Perez shoved Vaquer and jawed at her, so Vaquer shoved her to her back. The two went for wristlocks and reversals. Vaquer hit a trap pin with a bridge for two, then tried to transition to a crucifix but got thwarted. They reversed a few more times and Vaquer did her head stomps with the knees. Giulia tagged in and Vaquer hit a 619 on Perez. All four women were briefly involved before the ref got control.', 'Perez and Giulia continued to reverse until Giulia caught Perez in a sleeper. Jade tried to interfere and Vaquer caught her in an identical sleeper. Both heels fought to the rope and again the illegal wrestlers were sent off. Giulia booted Perez and hit her with a missile dropkick for two. The heels used some double-teaming to take control of Giulia. Booker T said they have a three-count to break holds. Vic said it was a five count, and Book couldn’t just make up rules like this is Reality of Wrestling.', 'Jade worked a headlock on Giulia on the mat as the mat slowed down for the first time. Giulia rolled to escape and rolled up Jade for two. Jade put down Giulia with a clothesline and tagged Perez. Giulia thwarted a double-team and then she and Perez went for big palm strikes and missed. They ended up finally connecting at the same time and selling on the mat. Giulia made the hot tag and Vaquer hit a springboard lariat. Vaquer headbutted Jade into oblivion then hit double knees on her. Vaquer hit a dragon screw on Perez out of a corner and covered for two.', 'All four women got involved again and the faces hit some stereo moves, but the heels responded with tandem superkicks. The faces bailed and Perez hit a tope suicida on both. Jade flew from the top to hit a back elbow on the faces. Back inside, Perez worked a crossface on Vaquer, who escaped quickly. The two fought up on the ropes and Perez hit a super huracanrana. Jade tagged and hit a rolling senton from the top. Yet again all the women got involved and hit impact moves.', 'The legal women re-centered. Jade got some rights in until Vaquer hit a backdrop to create separation. Giulia tagged in and hit a flash knee on Jade for two. Jade got in a knee to the midsection and Perez tagged in. They wanted a Doomsday Device and Giulia knocked them together, then tagged Vaquer. Giulia hit a double-underhook suplex and Vaquer nailed Perez with a twisting splash from the top to score the pin. I had Vaquer figured to pin Perez to warrant a championship match since Giulia’s had her first one already, but Giulia set up the move so she might have some claim herself.', 'WINNERS: Giulia & Stephanie Vaquer at 13:45.', 'As the faces celebrated, (the former Delta) Zaria’s music played and the lights went out, and one spotlight showed Zaria up near a private box. She stared down at all four still near the ring. There was still no sign of whether to peg her as a face or heel, but they could use a monster heel right now, so I’m guessing that’s where she’ll land.', '(Wells’s Analysis: Just excellent stuff here as the women meshed with one another and had some really nice grappling sequences before leading into some segments that leaned toward strong style at times. Jade doesn’t have perfect timing out of her long injury but she hung in there with the others)', '-For Premium subscribers, there was a pretty funny seres of pranks where wrestlers were trying to guess what was under a box by touching it, and it was the head of the Boogeyman, who had his head up through a hole in the table.', '-Je’Von Evans & Cedric Alexander talkecd about getting the tag team championships on NXT. Alexander said maybe it was okay to occasionally do some bad things to get ahead. Evans said he likes Alexander the way he is.', '-Dave LaGreca talked with Bubba Ray Dudley up among the fans. LaGreca told the story of Vaquer pinning the champion, with no mention of Giulia doing the work, so I guess we’re glossing that over. Dudley put over the women in the previous match, then did the same for the guys in the opener, pointing out that he’s one of the original men from the TLC match.', '-There was a hype segment for what led to Andre Chase vs. Ridge Holland, which was our bi-yearly chance to get one more look at the long-gone Bodhi Hayward.', '(3) ANDRE CHASE vs. RIDGE HOLLAND – Ambulance Match', 'Here’s one with some serious boom or bust potential. Holland entered to his familiar reaction of heel heat mixed with apathy. Chase got a decent pop. His Chase U sweater was a red and red and green striped sweater, evoking Freddy Krueger, and Vic said “1, 2, Chase is coming for you” just in case anyone was missing it.', 'The two went at it with rights and lefts early. Chase hit a big boot early and dumped Holland with a lariat. Vic said this was the seventh ambulance match in WWE history. I don’t know how many I would have guessed, but it would have been more. The two brawled up the ramp and near a hearse painted to look like an ambulance, keeping with the spooky theme. Chase used a fire extinguisher on Holland and Holland ran a stretcher down at Chase against the ring, but Chase moved and ran down the stretcher and hit a cross-body on Holland.', 'The men went inside and Holland took over on offense, hitting a delayed suplex into a powerslam. Holland went out and got a kendo stick and went at Chase with it. Holland followed up with chairs. Holland set Chase up in a chair and went at him with rights to boos. Chase popped up and tripped Holland onto the chair. They each picked up a kendo stick and Chase got the upper hand and hit some shots, then used it to assist with a Russian leg sweep. Chase did his CHASE U stomps. Chase went up and hit a high cross-body, then used the previously-seen chair and dumped Holland with it. Chase approached Holland but ate a body slam when he got there.', 'Holland peeled back some of the padding around the ring and set up a powerbomb, though from his positioning it was obvious that Chase would reverse to a back body-drop, and he did. Chase charged the stretcher into Holland a couple of times and they ended up near the announce table. Chase tossed the covering and Vic’s bowl of candy, but Holland popped up and bealed Chase with his spine against the apron. Ugh. The two jockeyed up on the table, and Chase ended up hitting a DDT. There was a “One more time” chant and Chase egged it on. He couldn’t deadlift Holland so Chase rolled over the stretcher and rolled Holland atop it. He started rolling it toward the ramp but Holland slipped off of it near the foot of the ramp. Holland had some ugly marks from the kendo sticks.', 'Holland shoved Chase into the steps, then rolled Chase up the ramp. He shoved Chase toard the ambulance opening but Chase crumbled. Holland reigned down with some rights. Holland wanted to use a pumpkin as a weapon and there was a huge pop. It ended up being Chase stealing it and tossing it at Holland which got a huge reaction. Chase went to the top of the ambulance and splashed Holland, then shoved him in the ambulance, but couldn’t shut it. Holland clawed at Chase’s head through the opening, then slipped out. He monkey flipped Chase into the bottom of the ambulance door, then hit the Redeemer on the ramp. He opened the door and shoved Chase inside. He shut the door to win. Vic called it the biggest singles win of Holland’s career.', 'WINNER: Ridge Holland at 14:32.', '(Wells’s Analysis: It was about the match you’d expect, with a few interesting spots in between some slow walking and brawling. Vic asked if “the lights are finally turned off at Chase University,” so they might be ending the long-term storyline, I guess, but where does that leave its members? Riley Osborne is still vanilla enough that you can insert him somewhere. Duke Hudson has charisma and can be of use somewhere. Thea Hail is a no-brainer to thrive as a spastic spitfire. The biggest question would be if Chase himself could bounce back)', '-Premium subscribers got a Nikkita Lyons segment. She’s apparently a “multi-dimensional superstar.” She should bring some of those dimensions to the act at some point. Liv Morgan got a longer profile.', '-Axiom and Nathan Frazer had their 3249823489th scene where they weren’t totally on the same page leading into a tag team championship defense. Frazer said “Could you be any more condescending?” and Axiom replied “yes, I could be you.”', '-Schreiber talked to Ava, and they talked about “Mr. Regal” cornering Lexis King for his match with his real-life son Charlie Dempsey. I can’t remember if as fans if we’re supposed to consider Regal and Dempsey to be father and son or if it’s supposed to be an Easter egg for those in the know.', '(4) WOMEN’S NXT NORTH AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP GAUNTLET MATCH', '(a) Kelani Jordan (c) vs. Jazmyn Nyx', 'Kelani’s gear was meant to be Poison Ivy from DC Comics (I think). She and Nyx grappled early, exchanging wristlocks. Vic mentioned that Kelani Jordan and Cody Rhodes are the only wrestlers in the company to be undefeated in championship matches this year. Nyx got dumped and Jordan hit her with a moonsault. Vic asked if that kind of risk was warranted in this gauntlet. Nyx went at the hair and then tripped Jordan into the corner. Nyx hit a bulldog and covered for two. The other members of Fatal Influence were strangely not at ringside for this, though maybe they’ll stay around as Nyx and Jayne lose the first two matches.', 'Nyx tried a suplex but Jordan managed an inside cradle for two. Schoolgirl for two. Angle slam by Jordan. Jordan went up and hit a 450 splash to win.', 'WINNER: Kelani Jordan at 3:32.', '(b) Kelani Jordan (c) vs. Jacy Jayne', 'There was no bell to start this one, so I guess they’re counting it all as one match, though that’s not what I did here. Jordan hit Jayne with a splash to the outside as Jayne was trying to enter, then hit another inside for two. Thrust kick by Jordan. Jordan wanted a split-legged moonsault but Jayne shoved her headfirst into the post. Jayne put up Jordan in the tree of woe and laid in some kicks. Back in the center of the ring, Jayne hit a senton for two. The crowd was pretty muted for this and the Nyx match, likely as they know there’s no reason to invest until Henley is out there.', 'Jordan evaded a move just to be nailed with a flash knee for two. Jayne worked a headlock briefly but Jordan escaped and hit some ax-handles. The two reversed a few times until Jayne rolled Jordan up for two. They did some more reversals until Jordan trapped Jayne for the three. Jayne laid in a Rolling Encore(? I think that’s what Vic said) elbow as a cheap shot.', 'WINNER: Kelani Jordan at 4:01.', '(c) Kelani Jordan (c) vs. Fallon Henley', 'Henley charged down to the ring and tried to pick the bones with a quick cover. She hit a few more impact moves for quick twos. Henley hit a running back elbow for two. Henley missed in the corner but hit a back elbow, then went up. The two reversed suplexes and Jordan ended up hitting something like a reverse Rocker Dropper for two. Jordan put up Henley in a torture rack but Henley went for the eyes (she missed, but Jordan sold it) and the two ran at each other and hit simultaneous clotheslines to sell on the mat. The crowd woke up somewhat for a “this is awesome” chant.', 'The two exchanged forearms and Jordan strung together some offense and laid in some kicks and stomps. Jordan went for a springboard move but Henley hit a cutter, and then a neckbreaker from the top for two. Henley sold surprise that she didn’t get the three. Jordan hit an X-Factor and then hit the split-legged moonsault, but Jazmyn Nyx hopped up on the apron and took the referee’s attention long enough for a kickout. Jayne then went up and attacked Jordan, who kicked her away. Of course, this was enough of an opening for Henley to hit her finisher.', 'WINNER: Fallon Henley at 5:51.', 'Henley tried to cut a promo, but afterward,the Zaria video played again. The three of Fatal Influence all waited for her to walk the ramp, but of course Zaria was behind them. She effortlessly destroyed all of Fatal Influence, then stood and posed.', '(Wells’s Analysis: The Fatal Influence girls each got short match times as the match got the same 15 minute runtime that NXT matches seem to get on a regular basis on PLEs. Kelani was strong in her long night though she ended up an afterthought as this was all about Zaria. The Zaria appearance after the tag match was a smart move as it had me thinking her night was done. Apparently she’s going to be a babyface also, though they’re wisely positioning her in the North American Championship scene so she doesn’t end up getting muscled out and forgotten at the top. I questioned the need for the North American Championship when it was introduced, and now all these months later it’s almost like there aren’t ENOUGH Championships for the stacked Women’s Division)', '-For Premium subscribers, there was a countdown of moments on the previous week’s NXT weekly show. #1 was Oba Femi destroying the Family through ladders. Next up was a series of Crown Jewel moments over the past four years.', '-Schreiber talked with Tony D’Angelo, flanked by the Family. He sold the pain through talk of how he defended. He called out Rizzo for “the crowbar shot heard ’round the world. Schreiber asked if Rizzo knew who attacked her last week. Rizzo said “I do, and I’m comin’ after her this Tuesday!” Cheap, I guess, but I’m interested to see who it is.', '-LaGreca and Bubba Ray talked again. LaGreca bemoaned the previous title change. Dudley transitioned to saying Zaria putting the entire NXT women’s division on notice. They talked about the ambulance match, and Holland showed up and jawed at Dudley. Holland had a mic with him, but he forgot to put it up to his mouth and we didn’t know what he was saying. Unreal. Bubba Ray said “That’s twice. You did this on the pre-show and you did it again now. Don’t let it happen again.” Holland slowly took his leave. They put over the coming main event, and Bubba took one more look out toward Ridge.', '-Booker and Vic were up on the ramp explaining that the Devil’s Playground match is Falls Count Anywhere. Booker was walking past a trunk and Tatum Paxley popped out and surprised him. Ava showed up and tried to talk to Paxley about her match Tuesday with Wendy Choo. Paxley said she needs to make it more interesting, and she spun the wheel. It landed on Casket Match. Ava said okay: you vs. Wendy on Tuesday night in a Casket Match.', '-Hype for the main event.', '(5) TRICK WILLIAMS (c) vs. ETHAN PAGE – Devil’s Playground match for the NXT Championship', 'Trick was dressed in a purple cape and his gear said “Trick Willy Wonka.” Vic said he had the “golden ticket to the top.”', 'Page jumped Williams during his entrance. Vic mentioned that this is the third match of its kind, and previously, Johnny Gargano defeated Damian Priest for the North American Championship in this match. Early on, each guy grabbed a chair and Williams took control and put the chair to Page repeatedly. Page bailed and got a pumpkin from the announce table. He pointed at Vic, who wore a pumpkin-covered suit, and said “You look like a dumbass!” and posed with the pumpkin, saying it looked like Vic. Trick yanked the pumpkin and put it over Page’s head and split it with a punch. The crowd chanted “Whoop that pumpkin.”', 'Action spilled to the crowd, where Williams beat down Page with a little walk and brawl. Williams posed long enough for Page to nail him with a trash can, but Williams backdropped him on a trash can and covered for two. The two battled back toward the ring and Williams missed a chairshot against the post. Page hit a DDT on a chair on the outside, covering for two.', 'Page nailed Trick with a chair, then a ladder. He rolled Williams inside and smacked him with a chair again. Williams sold the agony through another two count. Page hit a sidewalk slam through a standing chair for a long two. Page charged Williams to a corner and threw rights there. He snapped Williams from the top rope to atop a laying chair on the mat and covered for two. Page tried a suplex but Williams put on the brakes and hit a DDT to finally get a breather.', 'Williams got in a few shots and then kipped up, but then missed a Trick Shot. The two exchanged some reversals and Williams hit the Trick Shot, but Page got his foot up on a rope, which…should not have broken the count, given the Falls Count Anywhere stip. Vic said the ref was wrong, but called out muscle memory and the ref doing what he’s used to. If Page wins, that’s a huge out for him, so that’ll be interesting to see.', 'Page grabbed a bag – the kind usually filled with tacks – and poured it out. It was a bag of nuts and bolts. Page got reversed into the pile. The match spilled outside again and Page fought to grab the top half of the steel steps, but Williams put a stop to it. He uncovered the announce table, but Page charged Williams into the now-grounded steps that he’d set down. Page uncovered the table and set the steps near them. He put up Williams, walked up the steps, and hit Ego’s Edge for two. Williams was bleeding somewhat significantly from the mouth. The ref’s gloves were on and he called for some help. Officials checked on Williams and Page tried to close in and they told him to step away. Given the bad acting of the “medical professional,” it was entirely worked.', 'The match went back inside, where Page caught Williams and slammed him on the steps. It was such an ugly angle that Booker T yelped out in secondhand pain. Page had a second set of steps and he tried to slam them down on Williams, who moved. Williams lifted the steps to hit Page with them, but Page kicked him in the nuts. You don’t see that much anymore. Page lifted the steps and Williams gave him the uppercut to the nuts. Wow, twice in thirty seconds! Williams banged the steps into Page and then hit the Trick Shot to finish.', 'WINNER: Trick Williams at 15:54.', 'After the match, Williams only was able to celebrate for a moment before Ridge Holland charged into the ring and attacked him. Page tossed Williams over to Holland for a Redeemer. The heels attacked until Bubba Ray Dudley made the save. There’s a sentence I didn’t think I’d type tonight. At the end of the show, the two heels looked into the ring at Trick and Bubba. I’d guess if Bubba gets a match, it’ll be a tag affair that leads to a Trick-Ridge championship match. I wouldn’t write off the possibility of a double-cross by Bubba, either, in a managerial role as he has the chops on the mic to get heels over.', '(Wells’s Analysis: NXT has a very predictable formula for PLEs. Every match gets a thirty-minute window, which basically tells you outright how long the show will last. That’s well and good, but it makes the main events seem short because I’m expecting them to be longer than the undercard matches, and they aren’t. These two packed some real violence into a short window, and it came off as eventful even if it wasn’t anything you’d classify as a great match. The show-ending angle was teased by the pre-show, so I’m glad I caught the end of that, and could lead to some real odd angles on the weekly show as we hit the road to Deadline)', 'FINAL THOUGHTS: As stated, the NXT PLEs are really starting to feel formulaic and it’s easy to feel out when matches are going to end as a result. That doesn’t make them less enjoyable, but it seems like they could mess with the formula and surprise us a little more. I would’ve thought Oba Femi would be fast-tracked to the NXT Championship scene, but it seems like Ridge Holland has the spot for now. If I had to guess, I’d say that Holland is a placeholder and will do the job at Deadline while Oba Femi wins the Iron Survivor Match to get a future championship shot. The women’s tag was my favorite affair of the night by a pretty wide margin, and I walk away from this one feeling like the old talking point that “NXT has the best women’s division in the world” might genuinely be true again, even if they aren’t as polished as other divisions. We’ve got a lot of hints about the new directions on TV with Holland/Page vs. Williams/Dudley, Vaquer-Perez and Zaria-Fatal Influence, as well as the question of what becomes of Chase U, a staple on the weekly show for years now. I do hope we get some closure on the Ridge Holland-Thea Hail aspect of that, though. Nate Lindberg and I will be recording a VIP post-show, so look for that late tonight or tomorrow.

With this victory, D'Angelo became the first NXT Superstar to win the NXT Tag Team Championship, the NXT North American Championship, and the Heritage Cup."", ""“[It's] really cool to join the list of names that have held this title before. When I got it, it felt great. It was a special moment for me and my family. It felt like I got over a hurdle in my career.

With this announcement, some fans of the Attitude Era are hopeful to see some involvement from ECW Originals. One potential return that could work in D'Angelo's favor is an appearance by the ECW and WWE stable Full Blooded Italians.

Tonight’s card from Giant Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania will be NXT’s fifth edition of the spooky szn premium live event, this one featuring three ‘Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal’ title matches... and more! It all streams live on Peacock here in the U.S., and internationally wherever you get WWE Network.', 'In this post, we’ll give you everything you need to get ready for tonight’s show, with a quick recap of how we got to every match, and thoughts & predictions from our motley crew of NXT-following Cagesiders on each.', 'Let’s get to it.', 'With CM Punk refereeing, Trick Williams won the belt back from Ethan Page on The CW premiere. All Ego cried foul and sought a rematch, but had to win one when General Manager Ava put him in a Triple Threat #1 contenders match. Page did so by stealing a pin after Je’Von Evans had Wes Lee dead to rights. He followed that up by smashing the champ with a spotlight after their spin of the Halloween Havoc wheel landed on the stipulation.', 'Geno Mrosko: This Page program has run its course and it’s time for Trick to move on to something else. I’m not entirely sure what that is or should be — perhaps Evans time is sooner rather than later — but it’s definitely time to be done with this. Pick: Trick Williams', 'Sean Rueter: Was pretty sure the clock has expired on Page’s time in the NXT title picture, and feel very confident now that he’s stood tall and gotten the final word in his last interactions with Trick Willie before their rematch. Pick: Trick Williams', 'Claire Elizabeth: I just wish they’d have the guts to just bill this as a deathmatch instead of the vague and unhelpful “devil’s playground” stipulation. Like “deathmatch” comes with expectations, some of which (light tubes, glass) WWE is unlikely to fulfill, but even so 2024 WWE is capable of enough blood and guts to justify the name. Anyway, this is a nice big win for Trick but there’s really no likelihood of my man All Ego taking the title back here. Pick: Trick Williams', 'Marcus Benjamin: I’m on record, obviously, saying this isn’t an exciting matchup. Ethan Page vs. Trick Williams, even in this environment, doesn’t do it for me. And I usually love violence. But there were more exciting options, despite the short turnaround here that probably made this rematch necessary. Pick: Trick Williams', 'Cora Jade returned to help her friend-turned foe-turned ally Roxanne Perez retain the NXT Women’s champion against Giulia, so the newly signed joshi star recruited a former foe of her own — newly signed lucha libre star Stephanie Vaquer — as back-up.', 'Geno Mrosko: This feels a little too easy but you can’t beat the hot new acts in their first PLE like this even against the NXT women’s champion and a major star who just returned very recently. In fact, it’s all the more reason to put the newcomers over. Perez should already be on the main roster by now. Pick: Giulia & Stephanie Vaquer', 'Sean Rueter: Giulia already technically lost her first big, PLE-type match. This feels like a way to get both signees a win in one of those without putting a belt on either. Pick: Giulia & Stephanie Vaquer', 'Claire Elizabeth: Please just give me whatever ending rids me of tedious heel champion Roxanne Perez the fastest. Cora being back helps, but it ain’t enough to save it, and I’m hoping it’s just a matter of time before one of the international gals picks the title up. Pick: Giulia & Stephanie Vaquer', 'Marcus Benjamin: We gotta build to a rematch between Roxanne and Giulia. Therefore, a W over the heel team will do wonders for getting to that end. I expect a competitive match where the heels lose because they get too desperate. Pick: Giulia & Stephanie Vaquer', 'The Don did something many thought wasn’t possible... he ended Oba Femi’s North American title reign a few weeks back in St. Louis. Tony D’Angelo is on the side of the angels these days, so when Femi asked for a rematch, he said yes. The wheel did the rest. Femi’s since taken out two of members of Tony D’s family — Channing “Stacks” Lorenzo & Luca Crusifino — in the ring, and someone took out Adriana Rizzo backstage...', 'Geno Mrosko: This absolutely feels like the kind of match that will see Oba regain his title. Then again, maybe they feel like he’s ready to move on to bigger and trickier things. Pick: Tony D’Angelo', 'Sean Rueter: The stip gives them lots of cover, and Stacks & Luca have a reason to want to get some payback on the big man before their boss beats him again. Oba’s too big for this belt (figuratively, but also maybe literally). Pick: Tony D’Angelo', 'Claire Elizabeth: I gotta think the Ruler is moving on to fighting for the big belt pretty soon, and ping-ponging the title seems unlikely, so a motivated Tony D uses all the weapons at hand to conquer Oba once and for all. Pick: Tony D’Angelo', 'Marcus Benjamin: There’s no way they they squander Tony D’s big W and that moment with a loss here. Especially since he’s defending more than his championship. He needs some get back for the family, and possibly get to the bottom of who attacked Rizzo. Pick: Tony D’Angelo', 'The only wrestler to hold the NXT Women’s North American championship in that belt’s brief history has been beefing with the brand’s newest bad girl kliq for the past month. Fatal Attraction’s spin of the wheel landed on “Spinner’s Choice”, so the trio is going to keep Kelani Jordan in the dark about whether she’s facing Jacy Jayne, Fallon Henley, or Jazmyn Nyx until match time.', 'Geno Mrosko: They did very little for this in the lead up to it, so I’m just going to assume it won’t be the surprise of the night. Pick: Kelani Jordan', 'Sean Rueter: Kelani’s not the only one who can’t gameplan without knowing who the challenger is. If Fatal Attraction goes with Nyx, the belt ain’t changing hands. But the other two are probably overdue for a title reign, so I’d say the heels have a 66 2/3% chance of winning at Sacrifice Halloween Havoc. Pick: Fatal Influence', 'Claire Elizabeth: Honestly the fact that I’m not picking any title changes in the other two makes me think Kelani might be in for a shock loss to Fallon or Jacy here. Pick: Fatal Influence', 'Marcus Benjamin: I’m going to pick Kelani here and go agains the grain. Her reign, to this point, hasn’t thrilled me, but that’s no diss to her. This thing with Fatal Influence is the most interesting story she’s had so far. With that said, I can’t pick against her since it feels like the whole thing is just starting. Pick: Kelani Jordan', 'Ridge Holland was looking for a fresh start when he returned to NXT, and Chase U took him in when he was at a low point in that effort. It seemed to be going well when he and school’s headmaster won Tag gold, but as soon as they lost the belts Holland snapped and took out Mr. Chase, and his prize pupils Duke Hudson & Riley Osborne. But a few weeks later, Chase returned shortly after Ridge beat Osborne in a match. He wasn’t happy.', 'Geno Mrosko: They can’t allow Holland to win the entire thing, can they? He’s been running through all of Chase U and the logical conclusion in a babyface promotion is for the top guy in the group to finally fight off the hard charging heel. Pick: Andre Chase', 'Sean Rueter: Sure, the wronged babyface should win. But much as I enjoy the U, putting over a main roster reclamation project is pretty much Andre Chase’s job description. Pick: Ridge Holland', 'Claire Elizabeth: Babyface gets his triumphant revenge in thematically appropriate gimmick match, film at... when’s this show start, 7? Film at 7. Pick: Andre Chase', 'Marcus Benjamin: I mean, come on. Andre Chase is going to blow the roof off the place and I can’t wait to cheer him on. Pick: Andre Chase', 'Now give us your picks! Then follow our coverage of Halloween Havoc, and we’ll see how we all did.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
WWE NXT Star Confronts Extreme Legend Bully Ray Ahead Of Upcoming Show At Old ECW Arena,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1698675/wwe-nxt-star-confronts-extreme-legend-bully-ray-ahead-upcoming-show-old-ecw-arena/,"['', 'After winning an Ambulance Match against Andre Chase earlier in the night at Halloween Havoc, seemingly putting his storyline with Chase U in the rear view mirror, it makes sense to wonder what might be next for Ridge Holland. And following a couple of spicy interactions with WWE Hall of Famer Bubba Ray Dudley (aka Bully Ray) throughout the night, especially with ""NXT"" headed to the former ECW Arena a little over a week from now, it wouldn\'t be at all unreasonable to envision a showdown between the two right around the corner.', 'Holland first appeared during the Halloween Havoc preshow, interrupting Dudley and ""Busted Open Radio"" host Dave LaGreca, leaving the two annoyed to say the least. He then return prior to the main event, at which point, Dudley had enough, telling Holland, ""That\'s twice. You did it in the preshow and I let it slide. Now you do it on the PLE. I\'m telling you right now, don\'t let it happen again."" Holland had no words in response, but stared Dudley down before leaving the set.', 'Dudley (as Bully Ray), who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame along with D-Von as part of The Dudley Boyz in 2018, has remained active, appearing as a special guest referee at WrestleMania 40 when Bobby Lashley and The Street Profits defeated The Final Testament, as well as competing in several different promotions, most recently in a pair of matches for Maple Leaf Pro Wrestling earlier this month. With at least some semblance of an ECW presence reasonably expected at the 2300 Arena next week, perhaps that competition for Dudley extends to an active in-ring presence in WWE for the first time since 2016, as he looks to squash the beef with Holland.', '', '', '', '', '']"
Is TLC The Most Pointless Gimmick Match? | Question Of The Day,https://www.ewrestlingnews.com/editorial/is-tlc-the-most-pointless-gimmick-match-question-of-the-day,"['Welcome to another eWrestlingNews Question of the Day!', 'Oh boy, I’m back on this bandwagon again. But once more, WWE has pushed my buttons, so I’m posing the question to everyone else.', 'If you didn’t catch wind of it, the upcoming “Tables, Ladders, and Scares” match between Tony D’Angelo and Oba Femi for NXT Halloween Havoc has now been converted into a pinfall stipulation.', 'What does this mean? Well, functionally, they took a ladder match—because that’s all that a TLC match ever was—and they removed the one thing about it that makes it stand out from any other No Disqualification match, which is that you win by climbing the ladder and retrieving a title belt, briefcase, or something else.', 'My question for you today is “Is TLC the most pointless gimmick match that serves no purpose other than to be yet another entry in the laundry list of renamed No DQ matches like Street Fight, No Holds Barred, Good Ol’ Fashioned Donnybrook, and so on?”', 'Remember to answer with your response in the comments below.', 'YES! IT IS! Good lord, this annoys the absolute hell out of me, and I was really hoping that would change under Paul Levesque’s regime, but it seems like it’s going to continue.', 'It doesn’t irk me when WWE takes a No Disqualification idea and gives it a different nickname to fit a specific theme…most of the time.', 'For example, if you’re going to have people brawl on Christmas, calling it a Miracle on 34th Street Fight and tailoring the weapons to be based around that aesthetic is fun. The same goes for the Trick or Street Fight. But it requires actually doing something to dress it up, if you’re not going to have ANY rules be different.', 'By that, I mean Falls Count Anywhere is certainly a different match than a Last Man Standing match, and both are different from how a Triple Threat is inherently no disqualification by default. You can’t pin outside the ring in a regular No DQ match; only Falls Count Anywhere. They don’t do the 10 count to a finish in anything but Last Man Standing. While they may function very similarly, they are not the same match.', 'But TLC has only ever been three things: a ladder match (ie, climb and retrieve to win) that happens to also put more emphasis on chairs and tables just for the kayfabe sake of it, or a No DQ match that only focuses on those three just for the kayfabe sake of it, or a No DQ match that focuses on those three and anything else, which means there is absolutely nothing at all different from what the Devil’s Playground match will be!!!', 'WWE has so many interesting ways they can do gimmick matches. Why they choose to have events like Halloween Havoc, which frequently seems to fall under this problem of having a series of matches that are exactly the same, but given a different name, is beyond me. You mean to tell me nobody in any creative capacity in this company can remember any of the other gimmicks when it comes to that wheel?', 'Why aren’t D’Angelo and Femi wrestling in a steel cage to keep out the rest of The Family? Last Man Standing would have worked perfectly fine for this to prove which one has the best ability to withstand punishment. Hell, this could have been a mobster-based gimmick thing with D’Angelo trying to give him cement shoes, a Casket Match, anything.', 'Instead, there will be nothing at all different from the main event, other than that WWE is already showing its cards by saying the North American Championship fight will be the one that happens to have the ladders and tables, while Trick Williams and Ethan Page will end up fighting with those dumb kendo sticks they use in every single match now to replace the standard chairs.', 'What a huge disappointment for an event that has so much potential to play around with the Halloween theme and create some fun, exciting, and interesting gimmicks, only to cop out with the least amount of effort save for just having regular matches.', 'What do you think? Drop your thoughts below!', 'Satterly is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is the inaugural AEW All-Atlantic Champion. He is also known for his six-year tenure ...', '']"
