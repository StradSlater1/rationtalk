2025 Aston Martin Vanquish Returns to the Top,https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a62683698/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-drive/,"['Aston’s new range-topping GT model sings a siren song with a fabulous 823-hp V-12.', 'The 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish is a ghostly missile piercing the drizzling morning fog, its optional titanium active exhaust permeating the Sardinian highlands with an angry high-pitched wail. Only later when the sun breaks and dries the pavement can we unleash the full spectacle of its 823-hp V-12. Long, low, and menacing, yet forever elegant, this car is beautifully grandiose—a quintessential Aston Martin. And at $434,000 to start, a fitting flagship for a brand striving for the upper reaches of the ultraluxury market.', 'As halo models go, this being the new pinnacle of Aston\'s front-engine GT lineup, the third-generation Vanquish is substantial. Its carbon-fiber body traces an unmistakable Aston Martin shape, stretching 6.5 inches longer than the already-grand DB12, with an extra 3.2 inches of wheelbase. This is a big car, a two-seater at that. Its long, vented hood and front-bumper-spanning maw hint at the dozen cylinders lurking within. Generous side vents emblazoned with ""Aston Martin V12"" erase any doubt. Its broad rear haunches signal power. Lots of it. Yet, a lack of extraneous aero addenda indicates a knack for traversing continents at high speed, rather than topping the time sheets at track days. It\'s a Gulfstream IV to the F-22 Raptor that many supercars aspire to be.', 'We speak in general terms because the Vanquish will be highly customizable, with many of the no more than 1000 built annually (roughly a third of which will reach North America) expected to spend considerable time with the brand\'s Q bespoke outfit. Very few, if any, will be alike. Don\'t like our sample car\'s bronze-painted wheels or exposed carbon-fiber ""shield"" panel on its rear end? Talk to Q. The same applies to the lavishly detailed interior, though we do love the soft forest-green upholstery that fills the cabin with the rich aroma of leather and money.', ""You won't be able to fiddle much with the car's hard bits, including its V-12 engine. Redesigned with a new block, heads, internals, and twin turbochargers, Aston's latest 5.2-liter unit culminates in a weapons-grade 823 horses and 738 lb-ft of torque, the latter from a mere 2500 rpm. That's a healthy step up from the brand's last big V-12 model, the 759-hp DBS 770 Ultimate, not to mention the previous 580-hp Vanquish S circa 2018. Impressively, this new mill does its work without hybrid assistance or even direct fuel injection. With its exhaust particulate filters, it also should placate emissions regulators until at least the end of the decade. (A welcome side effect of no direct injectors, which can clatter loudly underhood, is an even more velvety purr from this V-12 when idling up to curbs.)"", ""That's not to say this engine is a sweetheart, at least if you're one of the Vanquish's rear Pirelli P Zero PZ4 summer tires (sized 325/30ZR-21; 275/35ZR-21s reside up front). Poor things. We commend them for how much traction they provide. But they can only hold on so tightly as the V-12 races for its 7000-rpm redline. Lean on it too hard exiting a greasy corner, even in third gear, and axle-chattering wheelspin rears its head, the car's stability control and electronically controlled limited-slip differential working overtime to keep things pointed straight. Catch it right, though, and the Vanquish is breathtakingly fast on the move, warping ahead with glorious noise and relentless top-end pull. Absent the launch traction of all-wheel drive, its quoted 214-mph top speed better reflects its straight-line potential than our estimated 3.0-second 60-mph time."", ""It's not all hell's bells, though. The heavy-duty ZF eight-speed automatic rear transaxle is smartly tuned for whichever drive mode (Wet, GT, Sport, Sport+, and Individual) you select, and a separate nine-stage traction-control function is accessible if you dare to deactivate ESC first. An automatic overboost system helps improve the engine's responsiveness, yet Aston also lightly manipulates the torque output in the tamer drive modes to provide a gentler power delivery."", ""The Vanquish's model-specific bonded-aluminum chassis feels properly stiff, and its adaptive Bilstein DTX dampers offer a cushion ranging from comfortably compliant to slightly brittle, albeit never harsh. Body roll around corners is minimal. As we arc through the tight, undulating bends of our drive route (and dodge oncoming Italians veering across the center line), its steering communicates front-end loads with satisfying clarity, feeling precise and progressively weighted, though not overly quick. Turn-in is crisp but measured, thanks in part to that long wheelbase tempering the car's willingness to rotate abruptly. Just remember that there's still more than two tons of coupe to contend with, which made us thankful for its firm brake pedal and standard carbon-ceramic stoppers (massive six-piston, 16.1-inch units in front; four-pot, 14.2-inchers in back)."", ""Settle in behind the wheel, and it's clear the Vanquish is a product of well-mannered schooling. It cruises calmly and relatively quietly when directed, with decent visibility all around. You sit low in the saddle, but your five-foot-eleven author had no issue raising the seat to better see the corners of the hood. Carbon-shelled performance seats that we didn't get a chance to try are optional, but the exquisitely tailored standard seats suit the Vanquish well. Its aft quarters can hold an available set of fitted luggage, and a panoramic glass roof brings some airiness to the cabin. Being a modern Aston Martin, its doors swing open at a slight upward angle to clear curbs, a flourish that never gets old."", ""For all its individual gravity, the Vanquish is similar in composition to its lesser Vantage and DB12 siblings, particularly inside. Twin 10.3-inch monitors for instrumentation and infotainment run Aston’s in-house-developed software and are bolstered by wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Plenty of active-safety aids help you keep a safe distance from careless gawkers. Yet, physical secondary controls haven't been lost in the forest of technology. Selecting drive modes is as easy as twirling the big dial surrounding the engine's start button—two of the many tactile knobs and buttons on the center console. Aston understands that many pilots, including us, still want that in their driving experience."", 'Comparisons rightly will be made with the also-new Ferrari 12Cilindri, which costs more (an estimated $467K), yet makes slightly less power (819 hp) and far less torque (500 lb-ft). Good company, if a bit racier in theme. The Vanquish, on the other hand, is strikingly honest in its mission as a GT car for the street, even if its mighty V-12 would feel at home on a racetrack.

Review: 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish packs power and purity,https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1144847_2025-aston-martin-vanquish-test-drive-review,"['Aston Martin presented the DBS Superleggera in 2018, which feels like a generation ago in the automotive timeline. Technology has evolved since, yet the 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish unveiled in 2024 as the DBS Superleggera’s successor mostly shrugs it off. It’s a little old-school, and it’s better for it.', 'In an era when nameplates often sound like they were spat out of a random-name generator, Aston Martin resurrects the Vanquish moniker last used in 2018. The new model replaces the DBS Superleggera, which replaced the second-generation Vanquish, which replaced the DBS, which replaced the first-generation Vanquish…notice a pattern? It doesn’t take an immense stretch to imagine that a Volante roadster is coming, but right now the Vanquish is coupe-only.', 'And what a coupe! Although the Vanquish and the DBS Superleggera share proportions, Aston added about three inches to the new car’s wheelbase by increasing the dash-to-axle ratio to accentuate the classic GT lines. Design boss Marek Reichman’s team penned a sleek, elegant silhouette that’s unburdened by bench-sized, race car-like wings, yet the Vanquish isn’t quite what I’d call subtle. It looks fast even when it’s parked. No one is going to assume there’s a 1.0-liter 3-cylinder under the hood. But it doesn’t wear “I’m going to punch you in the nose” styling. Reichman points out that every design cue is functional: the huge grille increases airflow by 13%, for example.', '', '', '', 'The carbon-fiber body’s pure lines set the course for the rest of the Vanquish. Here’s what you won’t find on the specifications sheet: a hybrid system, rear-wheel steering, and a head-up display. It’s just the essentials, including a big, front-mid-mounted V-12 and jumbo-sized carbon-ceramic brakes. Like rivals Ferrari and Lamborghini, Aston Martin is fighting to keep the V-12 alive for as long as possible. It’s not a concern about heritage or a way to highlight its rebellious side. It’s more of a business decision.', 'Keeping the V-12 “reflects what our customers want,” Simon Newton, Aston Martin’s director of vehicle performance, told me. “There’s a real interest in the V-12, and in the classic GT architecture of having an internal-combustion engine and rear-wheel-drive.” He only wants to embrace technology when it makes sense. His team considered using rear-wheel steering but decided it wasn’t necessary. Instead, they tuned the steering for agility at low speeds and leveraged the electronic limited-slip rear differential (a first in a V-12-powered Aston Martin) to dial in sharp handling at higher speeds.', 'It’s not like Aston Martin doesn’t have a smaller engine in its arsenal. While the Vantage and the DB12 use a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 borrowed from Mercedes-AMG and tuned in-house, the Vanquish receives a home-grown twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V-12. Its predecessor ticked this box as well, but Newton stresses that his team only kept the old engine’s bore, stroke, and V-angle. Engineers updated just about everything else to unlock more power while keeping emissions in check. The engine block, the connecting rods, and the cylinder heads are among the new parts, and the turbos now spool faster. The numbers speak for themselves: the new Vanquish delivers 825 hp and 740 lb-ft of torque, up from 715 and 663, respectively, in the regular-production DBS Superleggera. The V-12 spins the rear wheels via a rear-mounted 8-speed automatic transaxle and a carbon-fiber driveshaft.', 'The 825-hp output is massive, but it’s the torque that you feel first. The V-12 develops its peak horsepower at 6,500 rpm while peak torque is on tap from 2,500-5,000 rpm. It’s happy hour at the torque counter: the curve is shaped like a coffee table, not like a mountain range. That gives the Vanquish relentless acceleration that’s only interrupted by the transmission’s quick, smooth shifts.', 'Aston’s claimed 3.2-second sprint from 0-60 mph feels brutally accurate. Newton’s explanation that his engineers only weave in technology when there’s a good reason for it echoes through my mind as the road opens up and I accelerate from 45 to 75 mph in the blink of an eye. Where’s the turbo lag? There’s a microscopic amount of it if you really want to nitpick, but the new Boost Reserve system keeps it in check. In the brand’s words, this feature “increases turbo boost pressure above what would normally be required for any given part-throttle position, so it is ready to go when full power is needed.” You don’t feel this happening, it’s not taking away boost to set it aside for later, but you know it’s there when you floor it and the engine responds with fire alarm-like urgency.', 'And yet, there’s much more to this car than numbers.', '', '', '', 'One of the Vanquish’s best traits is the nebulous concept of versatility. It’s a grand tourer that’s happy to cruise at highway speeds, but it’s also thrilled to flaunt its livelier, more raucous side on a twisty road. Materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum keep weight down to a reasonable 3,911 pounds, and pushing the engine close to the firewall delivers a 51:49 front-rear weight distribution for balanced handling. It’s here that Aston’s less-is-more approach to technology shines: the Vanquish stands out as a driver’s car.', 'Adaptive dampers provided by Bilstein and shared with the DB12 and the electronic rear differential help the Vanquish feel relatively nimble around sharp bends. That’s seriously impressive because it’s not a small car. We’re not talking about a Mazda Miata. At about 192.5 inches long and 80.4 inches wide excluding the mirrors, it’s roughly 2.5 inches shorter and 4.5 inches wider than a Toyota Highlander. The steering plays a role as well: it’s excellent, both in terms of weight and feedback, and it makes this big GT easy to enjoy. While some supercars are boring when driven at 50% of their capacity and intimidating when driven flat-out, the Vanquish surfs a better-rounded wave. That’s reassuring because the Sardinian roads used for the media drive are sized for compact Fiat hatchbacks, not Aston sports cars.', ""It's not entirely old-school. Like the vast majority of its peers and rivals, the Vanquish features a crop of driving modes that change its character. GT is the softest followed by Sport and Sport+, and the Individual mode lets the driver create a one-of-a-kind configuration. The spread between these profiles is perceptible: Sport makes the suspension firmer while letting more of the V-12’s song into the cabin. Sport+ takes things even further, though it’s arguably a bit too hardcore for daily driving."", '', '', '', 'It’s in mundane conditions that the Vanquish really lives up to its grand tourer positioning. Calling the cabin spacious would be a stretch, but it’s not cramped, either. It’s a pleasant place to travel in, even when you’re stuck behind a Renault Kangoo in pre-rush-hour traffic that’s thickening by the minute. It’s also stunningly well-built; Aston made the effort to use materials that are pleasant to both touch and look at. And that’s what a GT should be: sporty and powerful, but also comfortable and luxurious. If you get tired of hearing the V-12 sing, there’s a 15-speaker Bowers & Wilkins sound system ready to take over.', 'The driver-first approach to design permeates the user interface. The driver faces a 10.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and there’s a 10.3-inch touchscreen on the center stack for the infotainment system that Aston developed in-house. That’s it. There’s no passenger-side screen or dashboard-wide display to give you the impression that you’re sitting in a rolling iPad on steroids. The brand also kept physical buttons on the center console including a volume knob, the climate control system’s switches, and the drive mode selector. All told, the interior is a massive improvement compared to the DBS Superleggera, whose center stack looked like a hangover from the middle of the 2000s.', '', '', '', '', 'Driving an 800-plus horsepower supercar is a memorable experience regardless of which brand’s logo appears on the steering wheel, but what makes the experience memorable differs from model to model. By detouring an electronic overdose, Aston Martin has delivered a car for enthusiasts who are more interested in heritage than in technology. We’d have called that industrial suicide a couple years ago, but here again much has changed since the DBS Superleggera’s debut. Authenticity sells at this echelon of the market, and the Vanquish nails it with the poise buyers expect from an Aston.', 'At $429,000, the 2025 Vanquish sits at the top of Aston Martin’s regular-production lineup (we’re excluding special projects, like the Valkyrie). It won’t stand there for long: the Valhalla is scheduled to make its debut before the end of 2024 as the brand’s flagship, in terms of power and technology but also presumably in terms of pricing. It sounds like England’s answer to the Lamborghini Temerario.', 'It won’t land as some kind of super-Vanquish. Instead, it will feature a 998-hp plug-in hybrid drivetrain built around a mid-mounted V-8 engine. It’s totally different than the Vanquish, and it will be interesting to see which high-performance recipe the brand’s buyers prefer. Act fast if you’re on team Vanquish: Aston Martin will cap annual production at 1,000 units in the name of exclusivity.', 'Newton told me that Aston future-proofed the V-12 until at least the end of the decade, so don’t expect to see the Vanquish try to appease regulators with a twin-turbo V-6 in, say, 2027. While it’s too early to predict what’s next, what’s certain is that something is next, and that’s a big change.', '“In the past, we’d have a launch followed by a long period of nothing. That doesn’t work,” explained Alex Long, the director of product strategy for Aston Martin. “We have a plan to keep pace over the life cycle of the car,” he added. Put another way, the days of Astons withering on the vine are over.', '—by Ronan Glon', 'Aston Martin paid for travel and lodging for Motor Authority to bring you this firsthand report.', 'Sign up to get the latest performance and luxury automotive news, delivered to your inbox daily!', 'I agree to receive emails from Motor Authority.

Aston Martin Vanquish review,https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/aston-martin/vanquish/buying,"['The Vanquish is not cheap. At roughly £330,000 from the base, and a lot of possible - expensive - optioning, you can have a £400k car without too much trouble. But there’s only slated to be 1,000 Vanquishes produced per year, so it will remain an exclusive proposition.', 'Having had a look, it suits bold colours as much as the more conservative silvers and greys, and the carbon ‘shield’ on the rear looks best. You can have it body colour, but it loses the impact.', 'To keep the GT element as front and centre as possible, we’d also go for the sports seats rather than the carbon performance shells; TG managed many miles in the Vanquish over three days, and they performed admirably.', 'One thing to note though: the 824bhp Aston Martin Vanquish, with its 5.2-litre V12 and two turbos, is not the most economical car in the world. When pushing around a particularly sweet mountain road, the fuel economy dropped well into single figures. Admittedly a snapshot of an intensely… athletic driving session, but worth noting.', 'Other than that, it’s probably also worth noting the existence of the Ferrari 12Cilindri - another hyper GT that’s surfaced at exactly the same time. It’s a similar price, similar performance, similar mission statement. Except it’s powered by a 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12.

2025 Aston Martin Vanquish First Drive Review: V12 Super Tourer Extraordinaire,https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-first-drive-review,"['CHRIS TSUI', 'Posted On Oct 27, 2024 8:01 PM EDT', 'The 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish does many, if not all, things brilliantly. But the thing you all likely care most about is what’s under the hood. Somebody go check what year it is because Aston has fitted its new flagship GT with a thoroughly reworked 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12—no hybrid motors, no all-wheel drive, no rear seats, 824 horsepower.', 'This hand-assembled car’s very existence as a 2025 model-year vehicle is a feat in and of itself and Aston even says its V12 will be around “until at least the end of the decade.” Remember when we all thought EVs would be mainstream by, like, 2030 because The Governments all said they’d be? It’s incredible what you can accomplish when you’re a boutique automaker who really only has to answer to one billionaire Netflix villain with a seemingly unlimited budget and a desire to go fast. Really fast.', 'As a thing, the Vanquish is a grander DB12 in both the figurative and literal sense—it’s 80 mm longer in between the front axle and A-pillars to accommodate those extra cylinders. Style-wise, it’s a stunner.', 'A bigger grille, One-77-style headlights, F1-inspired hood louvers, 21-inch forged bronze wheels that tickle my inner BBS fanboy, and a tasteful use of carbon fiber come together to make the Vanquish one of the best-looking cars being made today. That carbon panel on the Cyclops rear end, by the way, can be finished in body color for a more traditional look while little protruding bars make up the taillights, a bit like you got with the Vulcan.', 'The outsides of the doors and the sides of the body are made of carbon fiber to cut down on weight, but my favorite carbon bit may just be the side strakes behind the front wheels that say “Aston Martin V12” with “V12” in red to let you know it means business. Those are just cool, there’s no other way to put it.', 'Inside, it might look a lot like the DB12’s cabin, and key controls are indeed shared, but Vanquish feels a step more special thanks to additional carbon frames underneath the touchscreen and flanking the instruments. Knurled alloys, tan leather, designer cheese grater speaker grilles, and restrained use of chrome look, feel, and smell expensive. Just like every other current Aston, Vanquish is also a car that’s easy to get along with. A proper infotainment system developed in-house features wireless Apple CarPlay and accompanies plenty of hard buttons and scroll wheels scattered across both the center console and steering wheel. Fifteen speakers from Bowers & Wilkins sound and look great, in case you ever get sick of listening to what lurks under the carbon hood.', 'The seats are supportively plush, the driving position feels correct, and the steering wheel feels satisfyingly meaty to hold onto. The standard full-glass roof is always transparent but rocks a 6% tint and an anti-UV coating to keep the cabin from becoming an oven.', 'As an item, all of the Vanquish’s parts add up to a car that feels properly fancy and properly special. In true Aston Martin fashion, though, that pomp and quality doesn’t feel like overkill or gauche, sidestepping the trap of overdesign. A fair amount of $430K supercars are designed to be obnoxious and the Vanquish isn’t one of them.', 'Until, perhaps, you fire it up. A fire-breathing 5.2-liter V12 with two turbos may have also powered the outgoing DBS Superleggera, but Aston says the one in this Vanquish is practically “all-new” because the bore, stroke, and V-angle are apparently the only carryover elements.', 'A stronger cylinder block helps the engine breathe better than before. The connecting rods are also new and incorporate reprofiled camshafts. A new intake and new exhaust ports join a revised water jacket in the cylinder head. The spark plugs have been repositioned while higher flowrate fuel injectors have been fitted. Smaller, low-inertia turbos spin quicker for better performance and throttle response while a new exhaust manifold improves catalyst heating. A new Boost Reserve function accumulates boost pressure in the background under partial throttle only to be unleashed when the gas pedal meets the floor.', 'And unlike the Lamborghini Revuelto, there’s no hybrid system to speak of, not even a 48-volt mild unit. On the same token, it isn’t quite as pure as the naturally aspirated Ferrari 12Cilindri, but I dare you to drive the Vanquish angrily and come away complaining about its forced induction.', 'Let loose on a long, empty stretch of Sardinian highway, the Vanquish is, and there are little other words for it, fast as fuck. Zero to 60 mph in 3.2 may not sound all that special in 2024—the Nissan GT-R did the same time in 2007 and I don’t recommend egging on any serious EVs between the lights. But from-a-dig acceleration is not where this thing excels. It’s all about in-gear acceleration.', 'It’s how quickly it gets from, say, 50 to 80 mph. It’s what happens after 100 mph. After 120. And, dare I admit to it, how quickly 150 arrived, and how much more it undoubtedly had to give beyond that. Alas, given enough room and bravery, the Vanquish will reach 214 mph, making it the fastest, most powerful “series production” Aston Martin road car ever made.', 'Stomp on the gas while already in motion and the Vanquish is manic. Twelve cylinders, two turbos, and over 800 horses fill your ears with lead, making them pop with pulse-altering, license-ruining forward thrust. It is oppressive, remarkable, excessive, wondrous speed. It somehow doesn’t feel dangerous though. Aston has tuned the V12 to dole its torque out in a manner that will thrill the billionaires who buy this but stop short of killing them. It needs them around and alive enough to buy the next V12 Aston Martin, after all.', 'Standard carbon ceramic brakes are almost 60 pounds lighter than cast iron and provide stopping distances comparable to the Vantage. A new Corner Braking 2.0 system predictively maintains stability while trail braking by using more of the rear brakes, allowing for later braking. Track-speed stopping distances and trail braking behavior require, y’know, a track to truly evaluate, but we didn’t have access to one for this first test. But what I can tell you from driving the Vanquish on the road is that the brakes do indeed work, and work quite well.', 'A rear-mounted ZF eight-speed automatic transmission also does its thing well when left in auto—Sport mode is ideal for keeping the engine on-boil for spirited road drives—but isn’t ultra-quick-shifting when using the paddles. An electronic rear limited-slip diff introduces itself here for the first time in a V12 Aston Martin and helps the Vanquish negotiate corners like a much smaller sports car, which it does astonishingly.', 'It’s agile and almost darty on the switchbacks and feels wonderfully stable negotiating fast, sweeping bends. The steering feels spot-on in terms of weight, ratio, and feedback for a car that does double duty as a comfy tourer and a canyon carver while the chassis feels light yet unwaveringly robust. Bespoke Pirellis grip hard while rocking a fair amount of sidewall for a better ride.', 'Speaking of, calm the Vanquish down and it’s quite a good cruiser, too. Bilstein DTX dampers also seen underneath the Vantage and DB12 (Aston definitely got a bulk discount on these) are tuned with a comfort bias here and are indeed reasonably Comfortable. It’s not as sumptuous as, say, a W12 Bentley (RIP) but that car can’t hustle as hard as this, either.', 'Perhaps this is a foregone conclusion considering its price and placement in the Aston Martin hierarchy, but among the three current front-engine sports cars from Gaydon, the Vanquish is firmly my favorite. In my mind, it’s the only one that truly delivers on the company’s promise of a “super tourer.”', 'Supremely well-rounded and well-balanced between comfort and sport, it’s somehow more supple and usable to me than DB12 while still evoking the spirit of the Vantage, being thrillingly, entertainingly agile on a backroad. As an item, it also feels, looks, and sounds a helluva lot more desirable and special than either of its stablemates.', 'As a Normal, however, the Aston Martin Vanquish is also a car that makes me a bit sad. Because not only does it start at $429,000, Aston is only making, at most, 1,000 units per year, two-thirds of the number of DBS Superleggeras that were made. So, to the vast majority of people, the Vanquish is one of those cars that lives merely as an idea.', 'But when that idea happens to be a two-seat, unelectrified V12 Aston Martin that looks, drives, and excites as good as this, we’ll take all the ideas we can get.', 'Got a tip or question for the author about the Vanquish?

Aston Martin Vanquish 2024 review,https://www.motoringresearch.com/carreviews/aston-martin-vanquish-2024/,"['', '', '', '', 'Remember when Daniel Craig replaced Pierce Brosnan in the role of James Bond? Britain’s least secret agent was as sharp and urbane as ever, but a newly powerful physique lurked beneath his Savile Row suit. If Brosnan is the Aston Martin DB12, Craig is the new Vanquish. ', 'Positioned above the DB12 and replacing the DBS (formerly DBS Superleggera), this is Aston Martin’s latest ‘brute in a suit’. With a 5.2-litre V12 engine and an asking price of £330,000, the Vanquish’s closest competitor is the new Ferrari 12Cilindri, but alternative options include the Bentley Continental GT Speed and Lamborghini Revuelto.', 'To the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, then, where a new Vanquish awaits, idling with intent outside the hotel featured in The Spy Who Loved Me (ironically, one of the Bond films that starred a Lotus: Roger Moore’s aquatic Esprit). The sky is a brilliant blue and the navigation is primed with a four-hour loop on near-deserted mountain roads. Even 007 himself would surely be envious of this mission.', 'This isn’t the first Aston Martin to wear the Vanquish badge, of course. Previewed at the 1998 Detroit Auto Show as Project Vantage, the original 2001 Vanquish was powered by a 460hp 5.9-litre V12. Its DB7-on-steriods styling was by legendary British designer Ian Callum, who still considers it his finest work (and more recently reworked it as the Callum Vanquish 25 restomod).', 'After the Vanquish was ousted by the DBS in 2007, a second-gen model arrived in 2012, now available in both coupe and Volante (convertible) body styles, and mustering up to 595hp in ‘S’ specification. It gave way to the DBS Superleggera in 2019, which eventually signed off with the bombastic DBS 770 Ultimate in 2023. That created a vacancy for the role of Aston Martin’s flagship GT car. Enter the third-generation Vanquish seen here.', 'NEW ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH IS BASED ON THE SAME BONDED ALUMINIUM PLATFORM AS THE DB12 AND VANTAGE.\n\nCHASSIS TECH INCLUDES BILSTEIN DTX ADAPTIVE DAMPERS AND AN ELECTRONIC REAR DIFFERENTIAL.\n\nFORGED 21-INCH WHEELS WEAR BESPOKE PIRELLI P ZERO TYRES. PIC.TWITTER.COM/APYAZHRAVO', 'Like its predecessors, the new Vanquish has a full complement of 12 cylinders. Its AMG-derived engine features a redesigned block and heads, spikier camshafts, larger injectors and faster spinning twin turbochargers. There’s also a new ‘boost reserve’ function that retains accumulated air pressure to sharpen throttle response and counter turbo lag.', 'The combined result is 835hp – some 82 percent more than the original Vanquish – bolstered by a truck-like 738lb of torque between 2,500 and 5,000rpm. With an eight-speed ZF automatic gearbox driving the rear wheels, plus a ‘lightest dry weight’ of 1,774kg (reckon on circa. 1,900kg with fluids), zero to 62mph takes 3.3 seconds and top speed is 214mph. Any evil henchman in pursuit doesn’t stand a chance.', 'The Vanquish is the epitome of British understatement compared to a 12Cilindri or Revuelto, yet its carbon fibre body bulges in all the right places. From the front, the family resemblance to the Vantage and DB12 is arguably too great, but the rear view is highly distinctive, with a full-width ‘Shield’ panel that can be painted a contrasting colour or left as exposed carbon weave.', 'The Vanquish is based on the same bonded aluminium platform as the DB12, albeit with an extra 80mm between the A-pillar and front axle to accommodate its elongated engine. Suspension is by double wishbones at the front and a multi-link arrangement at the rear, with Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers, carbon-ceramic brakes and 21-inch forged wheels wrapped in bespoke Pirelli P Zero tyres.', 'Lift the Vanquish’s long bonnet – noting its F1-inspired ‘thermos louvres’ – and you’ll see the hand-built V12 is mounted right back against the bulkhead, resulting in near-perfect 51:49 front:rear weight distribution. There’s also up to 120kg of downforce at maximum speed, thanks in part to that upswept ‘Kamm’ tail.', 'Inside, the Vanquish feels as cosseting and comfortable as you’d hope. Aston Martin’s 10.25-inch touchscreen sits atop the centre console, but quilted leather, cool chrome and tactile physical switches are the order of the day elsewhere. Unlike the tech-fest cabins of some luxury cars, you soon settle in.', 'The media system itself offers wireless CarPlay connectivity, plus a dedicated Aston Martin app for Apple and Android that allows you to monitor your car remotely. Unlike the DB12, there are no tiny ‘+2’ rear seats; just an enormous carbon fibre strut brace and space for the tailored luggage that Aston’s ‘Q’ division will doubtless be glad to sell you. As for the actual boot, that holds a modest 248 litres.', 'UNDER THE BONNET OF THE ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH.\n\nREWORKED 5.5-LITRE TWIN-TURBO V12 HAS A ‘BOOST RESERVE’ FUNCTION THAT RELEASES ACCUMULATED BOOST PRESSURE WHEN YOU NEED FULL POWER.\n\nZF EIGHT-SPEED AUTO ’BOX DRIVES THE REAR WHEELS VIA AN ELECTRONIC LIMITED-SLIP DIFF. PIC.TWITTER.COM/I2LJ6GTKLG', 'A dial allows you to switch easily between five drive modes: GT, Sport, Sport Plus, Wet and Individual. Torque is limited in default GT and Wet modes to make driving easier, while Sport Plus lets the Vanquish fully off the leash. With a long drive ahead, I opt to start steadily…', 'It isn’t long before I succumb to temptation, though – all it takes is a slip road onto a dual carriageway and… wow this thing is fast! The Vanquish piles on speed relentlessly, riding a tidal wave of torque that makes light work of blasting past native Pandas (the Fiat variety).', 'The auto transmission shuffles ratios smoothly when you are cruising, then is almost as sharp as a dual-clutch ‘box when you take control via the metal paddles. And the boost reserve feature offers instantaneous right-foot response that feels more akin to a performance plug-in hybrid.', 'It sounds fabulous, too – less AMG and OTT than the DBS 770 Ultimate, the V12’s cultured snarl swells into a blue-blooded roar. Aston Martin Chairman Lawrence Stroll says his customers are more interested in “the smell, feel and noise” of petrol engines than electric motors, and driving the Vanquish makes it hard to disagree.', 'The Aston Martin was never going to possess the agility of a mid-engined McLaren, but it’s still a joy to hustle along some of Europe’s finest roads. It turns in keenly and seems to pivot around its own axis, the direct and lively steering complemented by a wonderful sense of benign, throttle-adjustable balance.', 'I’m aware from speaking to Simon Newton, Aston Martin’s handing wizard (official title: Director of Vehicle Performance) how sophisticated the Vanquish’s electronic rear differential is, yet it operates very much in the background, flattering you as a driver and making this feel like a shorter, lighter car. Drive a Bentley Continental GT Speed and you’re aware of the clever software smoothing your progress and occasionally saving you from yourself. In the Aston, the whole process feels more organic and ultimately more fun.', 'Indeed, the poise and nuance of the Aston Martin’s chassis makes taking the reins of 835 horses far less intimidating than you might expect. And if (OK, when) you do get carried away, the huge carbon brakes are reassuringly powerful and progressive. The only slight demerit is reserved for the ride, which is on the firm side for a luxurious grand tourer. On British roads, I suspect you might prefer the drivetrain in its sportier settings but the dampers in GT mode.', 'Aston Martin will limit Vanquish production to less than 1,000 cars per year, making it exclusive as well as expensive. Even so, with the clock ticking towards a reinstated ban on new, non-hybrid petrol cars from 2030, an immoderate and indulgent salute to the V12 engine – particularly one this polished – seems more appealing than ever.', 'So, this or a Ferrari 12Cilindri?

2025 Aston Martin Vanquish Is A Luxury-Appointed Rocket Ship,https://www.autoweek.com/news/a62720309/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-drive-review/,"['Aston’s V12-powered Vanquish is a glorious anachronism in the downsizing age.', 'Engines are getting smaller. Displacements are going down, and cylinders are getting cut away by the proverbial bandsaw of emissions compliance. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially because combustion engines are more power-dense than ever, but at the cost of the smooth operation and audible ecstasy of high-cylinder-count mills.', 'Well, the folks at Aston Martin aren’t shooing away from V12s just yet and might have added the most interesting Vanquish to its roster to date, considering the greater landscape of the car world.', 'The beating heart of this Vanquish is, of course, the aforementioned V12. Displacing 5.2 liters, it is essentially an evolution of the engine that powered the DBS.', 'The team at Aston Martin heavily revised the power unit but kept some loved antiquities like its port fuel injection system intact. A revised intake manifold increased air and fuel tumbling into the combustion chamber.', 'Helping move air into the cylinders is still a pair of turbochargers. As for how much an improvement this engine is over its DBS predecessor, we can go to the dyno sheet: 824 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque. That’s over 100 more horsepower than the DBS Superleggera’s 715 ponies. Power moves through a ZF 8HP95 transaxle before traveling exclusively to the rear wheels.', 'That translates to right-foot brutality. The Aston Martin Vanquish lives up to the expectations, and it’s a personal-luxury missile. Despite poor road conditions during our drive, power delivery comes easily, and quickly.', 'Albeit perfectly manageable, the Vanquish’s siren song from its V12 might make you push your right foot a little further than posted speed limits might allow and draw your shifts out until the V12’s redline. For what it’s worth, Aston says this Vanquish can stretch its legs to 214 mph, which we didn’t test—but it does feel like that’s capable.', 'Unfortunately, it takes more than just a potent powerplant to make a standout machine, especially when you’re approaching a half-million dollar price tag. That powertrain is stuffed in a large, bonded aluminum chassis that takes advantage of the powertrain—and vice versa—while also giving you the comfort of a grand tourer.', 'This is not a small car: 192.5 inches long and 83.5 inches wide with the mirrors out. That’s about the same footprint as a 2025 Bentley Continental GT, which has space for two extra passengers. Or, for even better context for the masses, the Vanquish is about three inches longer than a ’25 Ford Mustang.', 'This size doesn’t exactly translate into the road feel—at least, when you’re navigating roads large enough to handle its footprint. Dense city centers with narrow roads might pose some tense moments.', 'In twisty corners, the Vanquish turns in with precision, and at times might even be too eager to respond to driver inputs. On center, the steering wheel responds well to your input and translates that almost directly to the 275/35-21 Pirelli P Zeros in the front.', 'Carbon-ceramic rotors sit at every corner and are brought to a halt by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers. As you’d expect from carbon-ceramic rotors, there isn’t a ton of initial bite at low speed, and with cold brakes. But braking performance overall is good, with a firm but easy-to-modulate brake pedal.', 'As you’d expect from a luxury grand tourer, road noise and wind noise are mitigated, aside from the exhaust trickling into the cabin. Rolling down the windows helps further, but there is still some audio enhancement to help the V12 overcome that gas particulate filter that dampens some of its notes.', 'When you’re listening to the V12, you’ll be stuffed inside a quirky but lavish interior. The cabin is up to the task of its price tag in just about every metric. The standard seats are comfortable and lightly bolstered. While the materials all feel premium, the mirror and seat bolster controls are a little idiosyncratic but are easily learned.', 'Most importantly, at least to some, the infotainment system is perfectly usable. Apple CarPlay worked without any hitch, and the 10.25-inch touchscreen is the right size for easy use. The digital instrument cluster is also well laid out and works well. The steering wheel controls might be the weakest link of the Vanquish’s interior but, like any car’s oddities, can be mastered with time.', 'The bigger picture is that this front-mid-engine, V12-powered, two-seat grand tourer is a dying breed of cars that were built to do everything well, which includes having curb appeal. Its only real rival is Ferrari’s aptly named 12Cilindri. Both of these cars take different paths to the same, similarly priced goal.', 'Aston says there will only be up to 1,000 of these Vanquish cars built a year, of which roughly a third are slated for North America.', 'Orders are already sold out until “pretty deep” into 2025, the automaker says. That means you might want to reach out to your local Aston Martin contact to start ordering your Vanquish.', 'The Vanquish starts at $434,000, including a $5,000 destination charge, but that’s before you start personalizing your machine. It would be surprising if even one Vanquish rolls out of the Aston Martin workshop without a single extra option tacked onto the window sticker.', 'Would you pick the Aston Martin Vanquish over the Ferrari 12Cilindri?

2025 Aston Martin Vanquish First Drive: Mega Indulgence,https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2025-aston-martin-vanquish-first-drive-review.html,"[""Updating and modernizing a V12 in an era of electrification and engine downsizing seems a bit gluttonous, like going out for a three-martini lunch while your co-workers are eating salads at their desks. But when it's a V12 destined for placement beneath the hood of a nearly half-million-dollar Aston Martin Vanquish, this sort of go-big-or-go-home indulgence isn't a sin — it's a directive."", '', ""The new Aston Martin Vanquish is a long, low, wide and absolutely stunning coupe to behold. Yet this car's most impressive attribute is the monstrously mega powertrain nestled underneath that almost hyperbolically long hood. This is Aston's 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12 — yes, the same one that launched in the DB11 some eight years ago — though it's been updated for Vanquish duty."", 'The engine block is stronger, there are new intake and exhaust ports, the cylinder heads have been redesigned, and the turbochargers can spin 15% faster to increase airflow to the engine. Redesigned engine calibration software also plays a key role and alters the power and torque curves to give the Vanquish more immediate throttle response than you might expect from such a massive lump of an engine.', ""TL;DR: There's 824 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque on tap, delivered exclusively to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Aston Martin estimates a 3.2-second 0-60 mph time, and top speed is a stratospheric 214 mph. Awesome sauce."", '', ""Aston's 12-cylinder GT cars have never really been known for their sharp, sophisticated handling; even the new DB12 prefers long stints of fast autobahns than technical sections of California canyons. But the Vanquish has a newfound sense of athleticism, making it feel like it's more closely related to the smaller Vantage sports car than the next-rung-up DB12 coupe."", ""The Vanquish's body is largely made of aluminum and carbon fiber, so there's an inherent lightness to the car's body while in motion. That's a good thing since this is still a 16-foot-long, 6.5-foot-wide, nearly 4,000-pound coupe, and I'm driving it on the narrow hillside passes of Sardinia. But the ease with which the Vanquish dispatches hairpin turns along gorgeous Italian backroads is astonishing — and refreshing. The steering is quick to respond and feels alive in your hands. The throttle response is immediate, and keeping the transmission in its manual mode allows me to hold the Vanquish in third gear for long stretches of uphill S-curves. I will note, the gearbox can be a little slow to respond when you're the one dictating the shifts. But all told, this car is so much more nimble and visceral and exciting to drive than any 12-cylinder Aston that's come before."", ""Remarkably, this ability to cut a rug comes without any newfangled suspension technology; you won't find 48-volt active anti-roll stabilization here. Yes, the adaptive dampers adjust their calibrations depending on road surface and your selected drive mode, and sure, there's an electronic limited-slip differential that modulates power across the 21-inch rear wheels (and their bespoke 325/30 Pirelli P Zero tires) for better cornering grip. But the whole experience just feels natural and cohesive. The Vanquish is set up for twisty-road antics from the get-go; there's no special software setting to unlock that verve."", '', ""The truth is most of Sardinia's most technical roads are too narrow for a large, fast, incredibly capable coupe like the Vanquish. You'll never come close to fully opening this Aston's performance envelope, save for the occasional straightaway where you'd be remiss not to drop a few gears, nail the throttle, and listen to that V12 sing in its upper register 'til you smooch that 7,000-rpm redline. Dive into the huge carbon-ceramic brakes and the Vanquish scrubs off speed just as easily as it piles it on."", ""Settling in to long stretches of freeway cruising allows you to stretch the Vanquish's legs in a similar fashion. There's power for days, and the Vanquish simply feels like it can cruise across continents without needing to stop and catch its breath. The only downside is a somewhat brittle and chatty ride over rough stretches of pavement — and that's with the adaptive dampers in the default GT mode. The available glass roof also doesn't tint dark enough, so beware the extra brightness and heat on sunny days."", ""Aston Martin doesn't offer any sort of hands-free highway driving tech, but then again, not many automakers in the exotic spectrum do. That's fine; a V12 grand tourer compels you to stay actively involved in the driving experience — a commuter car this is not. That said, technological aids like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and blind-spot warning are on hand to make your drives a little less stressful. There's also a super-useful 3D surround-view camera system, which is a godsend since outward visibility isn't the Vanquish's strong suit, and everyone will be watching when you try to parallel park this big boy."", '', ""Other tech highlights include Aston's revamped multimedia system, which is exactly 800 million times better to use than the company's outgoing Mercedes-Benz-based infotainment interface. Apple CarPlay connects wirelessly — no mention of Android Auto, though — and while the touchscreen isn't the last word in responsiveness, it at least looks nice and has a logical menu structure. Sometimes, that's all that matters."", ""The world is your oyster when it comes time to spec a new Vanquish, and Aston Martin fully expects the majority of its customers to put their cars through the company's bespoke customization program, called Q. You don't have to option your Vanquish's interior in a full swath of blue leather like this test car, but please, don't do something boring. There are eleventy billion ways you can personalize a Vanquish, from exterior colors to wheels to interior hues and trim. Why would you do something boring?"", 'Aston Martin will only build around 1,000 examples of the Vanquish each year, and while the starting MSRP is officially $429,000, good luck ever finding a ""base"" example. Remember, a coupe like this is all about exclusivity and indulgence. Unlike the DB12, the Vanquish finally has a monstrously capable driving experience to match.', ""Steven Ewing has worked in the automotive industry since 2003.

Aston Martin Vanquish review,https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/aston-martin/vanquish/driving,"['Well, let’s see what we’re dealing with here. Ten-stage traction control (with ’10’ being off, rather confusingly), different modes (Individual, Wet, GT, Sport and Sport+) and an electronic differential. Rear-wheel drive only, and 738lb ft of torque. That’s what you’re dealing with. Oh, and a much stiffer base from which the Bilstein DTX dampers must push, controlled by an inertial sensor working from six axes. Apparently.', 'Well, you will notice the under-bonnet bracing and massive cross-bracing in the rear of the cabin. But despite all the new vs old tech, the Vanquish feels surprisingly… Aston-y.', 'Yes there’s corner braking - stalling the rear into corners to keep the back end pointing where you want it - and there’s the e-diff metering traction when you boot it out of a corner, but what strikes most is the fact that the Vanquish now has a trustworthy front-end and more grip than you think. It’s not a light car, feeling all if not more of the 1,900-ish kg quoted, but as you ramp up the speed, the car comes with you.', 'That’s the difference: you’ll be having nearly as much fun as something more specific when you get to a nice road, along with a soundtrack that’ll beat your eardrums in. That’s not the most impressive part, mind.', 'The best bit is that if you knock the Vanquish back into GT mode and just cruise it becomes a nicely relaxed labrador of a thing. It’s not pillowy, but absolutely somewhere you could do big miles without crippling your back or deafening yourself. The ‘box gets to relax, the damping slackens, the exhaust mutes. Doing the showy-off thing through town is less stressful and you can just sit back and enjoy.', 'Although parallel parking a Vanquish with that extra-long bonnet in front of an audience is not recommended. Best leave that to the valet.', '', 'Get all the latest news, reviews and exclusives, direct to your inbox.', 'By clicking subscribe, you agree to receive news, promotions and offers by email from Top Gear and BBC Studios.

"Underdog Aston Martin sets 824-horsepower Vanquish on its big, red rival Ferrari",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/reviews/article-underdog-aston-martin-sets-824-horsepower-vanquish-on-its-big-red/,"['The Vanquish has a 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 pumping out 824 horsepower.\nMATT BUBBERS/THE GLOBE AND MAIL', 'At the star-studded unveiling of Aston Martin’s new Vanquish in Venice earlier this year, the company’s executive chairman Lawrence Stroll took a clear shot at Ferrari. “Why are we here in Venice?” Stroll asked rhetorically. “We want to beat the locals. There is this red team – I forgot their name,” Variety reported.', 'To that end, the all-new 2025 Aston Martin Vanquish – a beautiful two-seat sports car that effectively replaces the DBS 770 as the brand’s front-engine flagship – would appear to be an obvious rival to the red team’s new 12Cilindri, at least on paper. The Italian car costs $554,439, while the British one starts at $514,800. The former has a naturally aspirated 6.5-litre V12 making 819 horsepower, while the latter has a 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 pumping out 824 horsepower. Both cars also buck the trend toward eco-efficiency, offering the world’s 0.1 per centres a rare taste of fiery 12-cylinder gas-burning power.', 'Stroll, the Canadian billionaire behind Aston’s latest turnaround attempt, is eager to compete with Ferrari and it’s not hard to see why. If he can bring his company’s valuation up from its current US$1.16-billion to something even marginally closer to Ferrari’s US$85.9-billion market capitalization, Stroll could potentially net quite a nice profit for himself and other investors.', 'With the arrival of the new Vanquish, every car in Aston Martin’s core lineup – from the Vantage sports car, to the DB12 grand tourer to the DBX707 SUV – has now been overhauled or replaced under Stroll. The 2025 Vanquish, however, is arguably the most ambitious car of that bunch, apart from the $4-million Formula 1-inspired Valkyrie.', 'The rear haunch sticks out a long way from the door.\nMATT BUBBERS/THE GLOBE AND MAIL', '“We got to revisit and redesign the whole platform,” James Owen, Aston’s senior manager of vehicle engineering operations, said of the Vanquish. “[The platform] is bespoke specifically for Vanquish,” he added. Where the previous flagship, the DBS, was more like a hot-rodded version of its lesser DB11 sibling, the new Vanquish is markedly different from the DB12. For one thing, the DB12 only has eight cylinders while the Vanquish has 12. Its chassis is also elongated (stretched between the A-pillar and front wheel) giving the car much more exotic proportions. More Ferrari-like proportions? Absolutely.', 'Seen at the golden hour under a setting Sardinian sun, the Vanquish is undeniably beautiful. Where the Ferrari is like a hunter-killer robot from a sci-fi future, the Aston is a sculpture carved in metal, an automotive Adonis.', 'Inside you’ll find a cabin covered in buttery stitched leather from the roof on down. It’s more luxurious than the 12Cilindri, yet more old-school in its button-heavy layout and not as high-tech.', 'Dropping into the driver’s seat feels easier than on previous V12 Astons, likely thanks to the longer platform. Out the front window, the long hood disappears out of view as it curves down toward the road.', 'The Vanquish interior is more luxurious than the Ferrari 12Cilindri, yet more old-school in its button-heavy layout.\nCOURTESY OF MANUFACTURER', 'On highways and twisting two-lanes, the Vanquish feels very much like the big, ballistically fast grand-tourer it is. The cabin is set so far back that when you turn the steering wheel it’s like you’re watching from afar as the front wheels dive into a corner. A new electronic limited-slip differential makes it all too easy to put power down to the rear wheels and build shocking speed between corners. The steering itself is precise and provides decent feedback, although it’s a far cry from the freakishly nimble 12Cilindri; that car has the benefit of rear-wheel steering, whereas the Vanquish doesn’t. On the other hand, the Vanquish is the calmer of the two and probably better suited to long journeys. (Not that it matters, but a sprint to 100 kilometres an hour takes 3.3 seconds.) Be warned, though, the Aston is prone to scraping its long and expensive carbon fibre front splitter on the road when faced with a speed bump or sudden incline.', 'The other big difference between the two cars is the engine. Aston’s 5.2-litre V12 uses turbochargers, unlike the Ferrari’s 6.5-litre mill. Turbochargers typically add heaps of power and torque, but mute an engine’s sound and limit how high it can rev. In the Aston’s case, the engine sounds as throaty and thunderous as you’d hope. The engineers tried to make the engine feel more linear in its power delivery by limiting torque at lower revs in certain driving modes, too. (In other modes, however, the full 738 lb-ft of torque is available from 2,500 to 5,000 rpms.) Still, there’s no mistaking this V12 for anything other than a turbocharged sledgehammer. It hits harder at lower revs than the Ferrari, but the Italian engine revs higher and feels altogether more exotic. Pick your favourite flavour of gas-guzzling hedonism.', 'More remarkable, though, this overhauled V12 engine – together with the elongated and stiffened chassis developed for the Vanquish – represents a huge investment by Aston Martin in its products.', ""The Vanquish's 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 engine.\nCOURTESY OF MANUFACTURER"", '“In this day and age, delivering and developing a brand new V12 engine is slightly against the grain and quite challenging,” Owen said. Every major component on the engine is new or redesigned. Not only does it make more power than the DBS, it meets tougher emissions standards too. It’s all the more impressive when you consider Aston has said it will limit Vanquish production to just 1,000 cars per year.', 'But this fight Stroll is trying to stoke between Aston and Ferrari is a bit of fantasy.', 'Aston is by far the underdog. Ferrari has more money and manpower, as well as a larger technological foundation to build upon. Its stock has been trending up over the last five years whereas Aston’s has been down or flat. The 12Cilindri is a technical tour-de-force; but if all your friends already have one on order, then the Vanquish is a devilishly charming alternative.', 'It’s going to take more than one new model generation under Stroll’s leadership for the British cars to truly compete with Ferrari. Plenty of Aston fans hope Stroll and other investors stick with the company long enough to make that happen. In its 111-year history, it has never turned a reliable profit. Maybe this time will be different.', 'The chassis is elongated giving the car more exotic proportions, similar to the Ferrari.\nCOURTESY OF MANUFACTURER', 'The writer was a guest of the auto maker.

New Aston Martin Vanquish Volante set to better expose V12 soundtrack,https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/aston-martin/vanquish/364780/new-aston-martin-vanquish-volante-set-better-expose-v12-soundtrack,"['', '', 'Not too long ago we saw the covers come off the new Aston Martin Vanquish, and following up will be a convertible Volante model - ready to give drivers unfettered access to the sound of the most powerful version of the firm’s 5.2-litre V12. ', 'Our spies have caught the new car testing, but aside from the obvious soft-top roof, there are very few changes to the Vanquish coupe test cars we saw earlier this year. One small detail is the lack of a ducktail spoiler on the rear – most likely due to the changes in aerodynamics caused by the drop-top. Flared aprons on the rear wheelarches suggest some changes there too.', 'Just like we saw on the old DBS, there shouldn’t be any difference in power output between the Vanquish coupe and the Volante. Its 5.2-litre twin-turbocharged V12 engine produces 823bhp and 1,000Nm of torque, which is slightly more than the 818bhp developed by the naturally aspirated 6.5-litre V12 in the Ferrari 12Cilindri. ', 'Despite having the same power as the coupe version, we expect the Vanquish Volante to be slightly slower than its sibling, which manages the 0-62mph sprint in 3.3 seconds and tops out at 214mph.', 'The reason for that is weight. Aston Martin increased the torsional stiffness of the Vanquish by 75 per cent over the old DBS with stiffer bracing and new plating. In order not to lose any of the coupe’s stiffness, we expect some more bracing in the Volante, which will add to the coupe’s 1,774kg dry weight. ', 'The price of the Vanquish coupe is ‘around £333,000’, according to Aston Martin, and as with the old DBS Volante, the Vanquish Volante is likely to command a slight premium - placing it closer to the £366,500 12Cilindri Spider. The Volante could also mirror the coupe’s limited production run, which is capped at 1,000 units per year. ', ""It's time to enjoy the finer things!
