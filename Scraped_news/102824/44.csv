"New Chris Brown documentary lays out years of abuse allegations against singer, from Rihanna assault to Jane Doe's rape accusation on Sean 'Diddy' Combs's yacht",https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/new-chris-brown-documentary-lays-out-years-of-abuse-allegations-against-singer-from-rihanna-assault-to-jane-does-rape-accusation-on-sean-diddy-combss-yacht-212748736.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'Chris Brown’s behavior is once again being called into question in a new documentary.', 'Investigation Discovery’s Chris Brown: A History of Violence explores allegations made against the ""Run It!"" singer by Rihanna, Karrueche Tran and others. Multiple women come forward in the doc to detail allegations against the R&B singer, including one Jane Doe who claims Brown drugged and raped her on Sean “Diddy” Combs’s yacht in 2020.', 'Brown’s attorneys deny Doe’s claim and call all the allegations in the documentary “malicious and false.”', 'Timed with the network’s “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign for Domestic Violence Awareness Month, the documentary looks at Brown’s rise in the music world — being touted as the next Michael Jackson — and how it came crashing down after he physically assaulted Rihanna in 2009.', 'TMZ obtained leaked police photos of Rihanna’s graphic injuries. In a police report, she said Brown repeatedly punched her with his fist, choked her until she was nearly unconscious and threatened to “kill” her. He pleaded guilty to felony assault and was given five years probation and community service.', 'Brown and Rihanna later reunited — brought back together by Combs, who invited them both to his Miami home to work things out — and split (twice) after that. Domestic violence experts in the doc explained how when people grow up witnessing abuse, as Brown and Rihanna both said they did, it makes it harder to end patterns of abuse.', 'The documentary details how Brown’s abuse allegedly continued. Tran, his girlfriend off and on from 2010 to 2015, was granted a five-year restraining order against him. The model claimed he punched her in the stomach twice, pushed her down a flight of stairs, threatened to kill her and threatened her friends.', 'Brown also smashed his mother’s car windows with a rock while in rehab for anger management, and broke a window on the set of Good Morning America. He fought with Drake and Frank Ocean. His former manager, Michael Guirguis, known as Mike G, sued him for assault, false imprisonment and battery. Brown was found guilty of breaking a man’s nose without provocation. Over the summer, he was sued for allegedly brutally beating several men, with the help of his entourage, at one of his concerts in Texas.', 'There have been multiple sexual assault allegations.', ""Freddy Sayegh, a criminal defense and entertainment attorney, said in the doc, “I looked at most of his criminal history, and he's got a 15-year history of nearly every year of his life being involved in reported violence of some sort.”"", 'The doc explores how, despite this long list of serious claims, Brown — who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, court records showed — has maintained his superstar status. One year after Rihanna’s assault, BET tapped Brown for a big Michael Jackson tribute. As he kicked off his ""11:11 Tour"" in June of this year, he joked to the sold-out crowd about attempts to have him “blackballed.” Brown remains popular with fans and is the second-most followed male artist on Instagram.', 'A Jane Doe appears in the documentary to claim Brown drugged and raped her in 2020.', 'She said she received “death threats” after suing Brown in 2022 — the case was dismissed ""without prejudice” — but she was speaking out to “shed light on what really happened.""', 'Doe said she was an aspiring dancer who just moved to Los Angeles. On a trip to Miami, a friend invited her to Combs’s home on Star Island. That day, she met Combs — who is currently incarcerated ahead of his sex trafficking trial — and Brown.', 'Doe said Brown was nice and friendly initially. She hoped connecting with him would boost her aspiring dance career.', '“We had talked, and he had handed me a drink,” she said. “This is when my memory starts getting a little bit weird” because her body suddenly became heavy and she started to feel tired.', 'Doe said Brown offered to give her a yacht tour, but she claimed he led her to a bedroom and raped her as she said “no.” She claimed he texted her after to tell her to take Plan B, the morning-after pill.', 'Doe said she continued to speak to Brown after the alleged incident, but processing it through therapy led her to realize it was a sexual assault. She sued Brown for $20 million in 2022, but texts and voice texts she sent Brown after the alleged rape surfaced, leading her attorneys to think she wasn’t forthcoming with all the information. They dropped her as a client. Shortly after, a judge dismissed the case, citing ""lack of prosecution.""', 'One of Doe’s attorneys, Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, appeared in the doc. Mitchell-Kidd has since said she’s representing her again, telling People, “I believe what happened to her is 100% true. I feel that I failed her as an attorney because I couldn’t make her comfortable enough with me in such a short period of time where she felt 100% comfortable being forthcoming with me.”', ""In the documentary, Brown's attorneys said Doe's claims were fabricated. A rep for Brown has not responded to Yahoo’s request for comment."", 'An attorney for Combs declined to comment.', 'A woman named Liziane Gutierrez also appears in the documentary and alleges that Brown gave her a black eye in 2016. She claimed she was invited to his hotel room in Las Vegas for a party, where cocaine, pills and marijuana were present, and she took a photo that allegedly angered Brown. She sued Brown for assault and they settled the case.', 'The doc also revisits Brown being detained in Paris in 2019 on an alleged aggravated rape and drug infraction. The probe was later dropped, and Brown — who maintained his innocence — sued the woman for defamation.', 'There was also a 2017 allegation in which a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted at Brown’s home, though not by Brown. The accuser claimed her phone was taken, she was given drugs and barricaded in a room where she was sexually assaulted. She sued Brown for creating an unsafe environment. The case was settled out of court.', 'The doc uses domestic violence experts and statistics to examine Brown’s lengthy list of troubles. It also points to how there were whispers and allegations about Combs and R. Kelly for years before they faced serious criminal allegations.', ""“Look how long it took for R. Kelly to fall,” Mitchell-Kidd said in the doc. “It wasn't good enough that we had video of him” with a 14-year-old minor at his 2008 child pornography trial. “That wasn't going to do it. It took things like a docuseries, [Surviving R. Kelly]. It took the power of the media,” she said. (Kelly was found guilty of eight counts of sex trafficking in 2022. Months later, he was convicted of child sexual abuse in a second federal trial.)"", 'Sunny Hostin, who hosted ID’s aftershow following the Brown documentary, talked about how she’s surprised people have seemingly forgotten what Brown did to Rihanna.', '“The assault on Rihanna was over 15 years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday because I remember being in the courtroom,” said The View co-host, who is also an attorney. “But I just recently had a friend take her son and a group of other children to a Chris Brown concert, and when they came back, I was sort of shocked, and I said to her and to the teenagers: Do you know that he really, really hurt Rihanna? They had no idea.”', 'Chris Brown: A History of Violence premieres Sunday, Oct. 27 at 9 p.m. ET on ID.']"

""I said to her and to the teenagers, \'Do you know that he really, really hurt Rihanna?\' They had no idea. Then, I showed them the pictures. The reactions were different.

Sunny Hostin Calls Domestic Violence an “Epidemic Hiding in Plain Sight” After Chris Brown Doc,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/chris-brown-documentary-sunny-hostin-domestic-violence-1236045734/,"['', '', ""‘The View’ co-host led a discussion on intimate partner violence after ID’s 'Chris Brown: A History of Violence' premiered Sunday night."", 'BY ETAN VLESSING', '', 'The View co-host Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, wants viewers who watched the Chris Brown: A History of Violence documentary Sunday night to know that intimate partner violence has no boundaries.', '“Domestic violence is an epidemic hiding in plain sight. It doesn’t discriminate. In that respect, wealth has little to do with many instances,” Hostin told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday, ahead of hosting the aftershow discussion on domestic violence that aired after the Investigation Discovery doc on Chris Brown.', '', 'The doc explored Brown’s years of alleged offstage aggression, including intimate-partner violence, assault charges and sexual assault allegations that first came to light in 2009 when the star rapper pled guilty to a felony charge of physically assaulting former girlfriend Rihanna.', '', '“That was not an isolated incident. It only got attention because there’s a big name attached to it. And our goal is to say: This is happening to so many people and you are not alone,” said Hostin, who is also a board member at Safe Horizon, a national organization working to reduce relationship violence and abuse.', 'Progress to stem domestic violence, she added, will not be made if allegations and cases around celebrity abusers are sensationalized and the stories of ordinary survivors are not heard. “This is something that doesn’t only happen to famous people. It doesn’t only happen to Rihanna. It doesn’t only happen with an R. Kelly or a P. Diddy or a Harvey Weinstein or a Jeffrey Epstein,” Hostin insisted.', 'The legal system can hold domestic and intimate partner abusers to account, but without the media attention given to high-profile cases involving the rich and famous. Given the scale of the problem, Hostin said she jumped at the opportunity to host the after-premiere panel for the Brown doc to offer tools and resources to educate viewers on how to identify abuse and stop domestic violence.

Amid the ongoing federal probe surrounding Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ sex trafficking and racketeering charges, the upcoming documentary will further lift the lid on the connection between him and his longtime friend, Brown, illustrating an unsavoury account alleged by an aspiring dancer."", 'Releasing on October 27, the ID doc revives the harrowing memories of Brown’s alleged assault, domestic violence and more. Adding to that ugly list of accusations, an anonymous woman comes forward claiming that the “Under the Influence” singer raped her in 2020. (Also read: After Diddy documentary announcement, ‘Quiet on Set’ network confirms Chris Brown domestic violence title)', '“Even coming forward as a Jane Doe, some people still found out who I was,” the Jane Doe says. “Coming forward with this now, I just hope I can shed light on what really happened.” She also emphasises that she received death threats after the alleged incident, presumably why she’s still concealing her identity while speaking out against Brown.', 'The R&B singer’s accuser claims that an acquaintance contacted her on December 30, 2020, inviting her to Diddy’s yacht during her Miami trip with a friend. Doe had reportedly recently shifted to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional dancer.', '', ""After arriving, she realised that Brown was also there. She perceived his presence as a “sign” in the right direction, hoping to gain industry advice from the acclaimed singer. At some point during their conversation, Brown had supposedly handed her a drink, but eventually, her fuzzy memory failed her. “I'm not even sure... this is when my memory starts getting a little bit weird,” she claims. “I don't remember if I saw him pour it, but I just drank it and he just hands me another drink. As I'm standing there, I did start to feel tired and my body was feeling a little heavy.”"", ""Per Doe’s account in the documentary, the “Turn Up the Music” crooner then took her to a bedroom where Brown allegedly engaged in a sexual encounter with her despite her being out of all sorts. “I remember I did lay back and I'm like, 'Why can't I get up?' Next thing I know he was on top of me and I couldn’t move and I said 'No' and then I felt him… next thing I knew he was inside me,” she adds. Doe maintains that she was so “disgusted” that Brown purportedly ejaculated inside her."", 'After allegedly raping her, the R&B musician caught hold of her phone and left himself a text, possibly as a means to get her number. She believes that while “most girls I think would be happy,” Doe couldn’t come to terms with what had happened and it wasn’t what she wanted.', 'Doe also claims to have continued to contact the singer for “more clarity” on what allegedly happened between them. She seemingly only finally came around to the idea of admitting that she’d been sexually assaulted after undergoing therapy. “I know it for a fact. Instead of telling myself that it wasn’t. It was. It was rape,” she says.', 'Also read | Viral: Tom Holland goes full-on Spider-Man to protect Zendaya from swarming paparazzi; fans ‘love a protective bf’', 'Additionally, the ID documentary shows that even though she collaborated with a legal team to bring this incident to light, her case was dismissed “without prejudice” in 2022, citing “lack of prosecution,” PEOPLE reported.', 'Rolling Stone has also previously informed that her lawyers called off their agreement with the woman after police discovered text messages between her and Brown post the incident. Through her initial lawsuit, Doe sought $20 million in damages.', 'The legality of the situation has reportedly spurred back into action as Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, one of Doe’s lawyers, is representing her again. “I adore my client, and I believe what happened to her is 100% true. I feel that I failed her as an attorney because I couldn’t make her comfortable enough with me in such a short period of time where she felt 100% comfortable being forthcoming with me,” she makes a statement. Doe’s attorney, Mitchell, also firmly claims in the documentary that Brown was guilty of the charges, but the music industry saved him and other predators.', 'Chris Brown’s attorney denied the allegation in the documentary, accusing Doe of fabricating her claims against their client. Meanwhile, now-disgraced hip-hop mogul P. Diddy’s attorney chose not to comment while the Bad Boy Records founder is being held behind bars without bail.', 'The most high-profile case under Brown’s list of allegations continues to be his assault on his former girlfriend, Rihanna. Both ex-lovers were entangled in a toxic relationship in the early 2000s. He was eventually arrested for physically assaulting her before the Grammy Awards in 2009. Months later, he pleaded guilty to a felony and ultimately accepted a plea deal of community labour, five years’ probation and domestic violence counselling.', 'The “Forever” singer has also been embroiled in cases of offstage aggression, physical altercations and other legal struggles over the years.', '“The most difficult aspect is controlling myself around the ladies. I just be ridiculous, cuz I love them so much,” a young Chris admits in archival footage in Chris Brown: A History of Violence.', 'The new Chris Brown documentary will be out on ID on Sunday, October 27.', '', '', '']"

Being able to shine a light on that is really valuable for our viewers,” Sarlanis told The Hollywood Reporter about his network reaching viewers who need help, or may not even know they’re in an abusive relationship.', 'Sarlanis cites ID’s third annual No Excuse for Abuse campaign that coincides with the Chris Brown doc for offering tools and resources to educate viewers, identify abuse and help stop domestic violence. The TV network, also behind this year’s bombshell Quiet on Set documentary, explores in the doc the pop idol’s years of alleged offstage aggression, including intimate-partner violence, assault charges and sexual assault allegations.', 'That narrative of alleged abuse and assault follows the February 2009 incident where Brown brutally assaulted then-girlfriend Rihanna and accepted a plea deal that included five years’ probation and domestic violence counseling.', 'Sarlanis argues that Brown’s career trajectory since 2009 is an example of a Hollywood industry that “time and time again enables wrongdoers.” But while Brown’s celebrity and wealth has helped shield him from accountability, the ID boss says his 2009 incident with Rihanna can be mirrored in domestic violence cases everywhere.', '“When you look specifically at the story of Chris Brown and Rihanna and the tragic events that occurred in 2009, events like those are happening in households across the country with people who have far less name recognition and this allows us to tell those stories on a bigger stage,” he says of the doc from Ample Entertainment. “It might not be the same example in homes across the country, but it’s the same tactics being used by abusers, and so recognizing those tactics, however they materialize, is critical to empowering our viewers.”', 'The ID doc features an extended interview with Jane Doe, an accuser who in December 2020, was invited to a party held by fellow rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs on Star Island, where she alleged Brown raped her in a bedroom on a yacht.

And I believe her story will resonate, sadly, with far too many of her viewers,” Sarlanis said, as what motivated the ID doc on Brown. “We need to normalize surviving. One in four women are impacted by this. That number is staggering and to have any shame associated with being a survivor will perpetuate the very cycles that allow that number one-in-four to continue. Ultimately, our goal has to be to get that ratio lower,” Sarlanis insisted.', 'When the ID doc producers reached out to Brown and his representatives, an attorney for the singer said the allegations in the program were “malicious and false.”', 'Chris Brown: A History of Violence and the No Excuse for Abuse campaign together target a giant audience, as the doc indicates one in four women have experienced sexual violence, physical violence and even stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.

Multiple women come forward in the doc to detail allegations against the R&B singer, including one Jane Doe who claims Brown drugged and raped her on Sean “Diddy” Combs’s yacht in 2020.', 'Brown’s attorneys deny Doe’s claim and call all the allegations in the documentary “malicious and false.”', 'Timed with the network’s “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign for Domestic Violence Awareness Month, the documentary looks at Brown’s rise in the music world — being touted as the next Michael Jackson — and how it came crashing down after he physically assaulted Rihanna in 2009.', 'TMZ obtained leaked police photos of Rihanna’s graphic injuries. In a police report, she said Brown repeatedly punched her with his fist, choked her until she was nearly unconscious and threatened to “kill” her. He pleaded guilty to felony assault and was given five years probation and community service.', 'Brown and Rihanna later reunited — brought back together by Combs, who invited them both to his Miami home to work things out — and split (twice) after that. Domestic violence experts in the doc explained how when people grow up witnessing abuse, as Brown and Rihanna both said they did, it makes it harder to end patterns of abuse.', 'The documentary details how Brown’s abuse allegedly continued. Tran, his girlfriend off and on from 2010 to 2015, was granted a five-year restraining order against him. The model claimed he punched her in the stomach twice, pushed her down a flight of stairs, threatened to kill her and threatened her friends.', 'Brown also smashed his mother’s car windows with a rock while in rehab for anger management, and broke a window on the set of Good Morning America. He fought with Drake and Frank Ocean. His former manager, Michael Guirguis, known as Mike G, sued him for assault, false imprisonment and battery.

One year after Rihanna’s assault, BET tapped Brown for a big Michael Jackson tribute. As he kicked off his ""11:11 Tour"" in June of this year, he joked to the sold-out crowd about attempts to have him “blackballed.” Brown remains popular with fans and is the second-most followed male artist on Instagram.', 'A Jane Doe appears in the documentary to claim Brown drugged and raped her in 2020.', 'She said she received “death threats” after suing Brown in 2022 — the case was dismissed ""without prejudice” — but she was speaking out to “shed light on what really happened.""', 'Doe said she was an aspiring dancer who just moved to Los Angeles.

They dropped her as a client. Shortly after, a judge dismissed the case, citing ""lack of prosecution.""', 'One of Doe’s attorneys, Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, appeared in the doc.

I feel that I failed her as an attorney because I couldn’t make her comfortable enough with me in such a short period of time where she felt 100% comfortable being forthcoming with me.”', ""In the documentary, Brown's attorneys said Doe's claims were fabricated. A rep for Brown has not responded to Yahoo’s request for comment."", 'An attorney for Combs declined to comment.', 'A woman named Liziane Gutierrez also appears in the documentary and alleges that Brown gave her a black eye in 2016. She claimed she was invited to his hotel room in Las Vegas for a party, where cocaine, pills and marijuana were present, and she took a photo that allegedly angered Brown. She sued Brown for assault and they settled the case.', 'The doc also revisits Brown being detained in Paris in 2019 on an alleged aggravated rape and drug infraction. The probe was later dropped, and Brown — who maintained his innocence — sued the woman for defamation.', 'There was also a 2017 allegation in which a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted at Brown’s home, though not by Brown. The accuser claimed her phone was taken, she was given drugs and barricaded in a room where she was sexually assaulted. She sued Brown for creating an unsafe environment. The case was settled out of court.', 'The doc uses domestic violence experts and statistics to examine Brown’s lengthy list of troubles. It also points to how there were whispers and allegations about Combs and R. Kelly for years before they faced serious criminal allegations.', ""“Look how long it took for R. Kelly to fall,” Mitchell-Kidd said in the doc. “It wasn't good enough that we had video of him” with a 14-year-old minor at his 2008 child pornography trial. “That wasn't going to do it. It took things like a docuseries, [Surviving R. Kelly]. It took the power of the media,” she said. (Kelly was found guilty of eight counts of sex trafficking in 2022. Months later, he was convicted of child sexual abuse in a second federal trial.)"", 'Sunny Hostin, who hosted ID’s aftershow following the Brown documentary, talked about how she’s surprised people have seemingly forgotten what Brown did to Rihanna.', '“The assault on Rihanna was over 15 years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday because I remember being in the courtroom,” said The View co-host, who is also an attorney. “But I just recently had a friend take her son and a group of other children to a Chris Brown concert, and when they came back, I was sort of shocked, and I said to her and to the teenagers: Do you know that he really, really hurt Rihanna?

Woman Alleges Chris Brown Drugged and Raped Her On Diddy's Yacht in 2020,https://www.complex.com/music/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/woman-alleges-drugged-and-raped-chris-brown-2020,"[""The anonymous woman made the accusation in new Investigation Discovery documentary 'Chris Brown: A History of Violence.'"", 'Got something to say?', 'An anonymous woman claims that she was drugged and raped by Chris Brown on a yacht owned by Diddy in 2020.', ""While Sean 'Diddy' Combs is currently being held in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center on a separate sexual assault and trafficking case, the allegation towards Brown was made in the new Investigation Discovery documentary Chris Brown: A History of Violence. Along with other women who made claims of sexual and physical assault enacted by the R&B singer, a Jane Doe alleged that Brown raped her during a Miami trip."", ""As People reports, Doe said she'd moved to Los Angeles to pursue a dance career shortly before the incident and took a vacation to Miami with a friend in December 2020. On Dec. 30, a person she knew called her and invited her to the yacht party."", 'Upon arrival, the woman saw Brown, which she thought was a ""sign"" that the now-35-year-old could ""maybe be able to help me or guide me or give me some advice.""', '""We had talked, and he had handed me a drink. I\'m not even sure... this is when my memory starts getting a little bit weird,"" she alleged. ""I don\'t remember if I saw him pour it, but I just drank it and he just hands me another drink. As I\'m standing there, I did start to feel tired and my body was feeling a little heavy.""', 'It was after consuming the drink that Brown allegedly took her to a bedroom. ""I remember I did lay back and I\'m like, \'Why can\'t I get up?\' Next thing I know he was on top of me and I couldn’t move and I said \'No\' and then I felt him… next thing I knew he was inside me,"" Doe tearfully said. She added that the singer ejaculated inside her. ""I was so disgusted,"" she said.', 'Doe claimed that Brown grabbed her phone and texted himself on it and although she briefly continued to speak with the singer to gather ""more clarity"" about the incident, that it was in therapy that she came to understand she was sexually assaulted.', '""I know it for a fact. Instead of telling myself that it wasn’t. It was. It was rape,"" she said.', 'While a legal team contacted Doe to build a case, the case was dismissed in December 2022 for a ""lack of prosecution."" Alleged texts and voicemails from Doe to Brown following the alleged rape resulted in lawyers dropping the woman as a client. At the time, Brown also threatened a lawsuit.', '""None of the text[s] disproved the occurrence of the sexual assault. I want people to realize that and stop shaming victims and/or calling them liars just because they love an artist they don’t even know,"" Doe said in a statement to People.', 'One of Doe\'s lawyers, Ariel Mitchell, has returned to the case, calling what happened to her client ""100% true.""', '""I feel that I failed her as an attorney because I couldn’t make her comfortable enough with me in such a short period of time where she felt 100% comfortable being forthcoming with me,"" Mitchell stated.', 'Multiple domestic assault allegations have followed Brown since 2009, the year he was arrested for severely beating his then-girlfriend, Rihanna.', 'Following the Oct. 27 premiere of Chris Brown: A History of Violence on ID at 9 p.m., The View co-host Sunny Hostin will moderate a televised conversation focused on intimate partner violence.', 'BY ENTERING YOUR EMAIL, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE CUSTOMIZED MARKETING MESSAGES FROM US AND OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS.

Chris Brown Drugged and Raped Me on Diddy’s Yacht: Accuser Speaks Out,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-brown-drugged-and-raped-me-on-diddys-yacht-accuser-speaks-out/,"['Entertainment Critic', 'Chris Brown’s “history of violence” has never been so thoroughly elucidated as it is in a new documentary premiering this weekend on Investigation Discovery. Brown is a self-avowed abuser of former girlfriend Rihanna, whom he horrifically battered on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards, and in the years since, the R&B singer has been the subject of lawsuits and accusations from multiple women who claim that he physically, verbally, emotionally, or sexually assaulted them.', 'In terms of vile reputations, only a few celebrities have him beat—such as Diddy, who was a long-time friend of Brown’s, and was even the host of a get-together where Brown allegedly raped an aspiring dancer. At the time, Brown indirectly denied the reports with an Instagram message that read, “Whenever I’m releasing music or projects, ‘THEY’ try to pull some real bulls--t.”', '', '', '', 'Jane Doe’s accusation led to a $20 million lawsuit but was dismissed by conflicting text message records, and the fact that her lawyer Ariel Mitchell eventually departed the case suggests that questions remain about this incident. Nonetheless, Mitchell also makes clear in that she firmly believes that Brown was guilty of the charges, and moreover, that the music industry protects him and other predators. That Brown kept making music and retained an enormous fanbase—he’s reportedly the second-most followed male artist on Instagram—supports that notion, as does his repeated success at avoiding grave legal penalties for his misconduct. Even with his assault of Rihanna, of which there was incontrovertible photographic evidence, Brown merely received a slap on the wrist: Five years of probation and approximately six months of community labor.', 'There’s no doubt that Brown viciously beat Rihanna, repeatedly punching her in the face while driving his Lamborghini after trying to throw her out of the moving vehicle, threatening to “beat the shit out of you when we get home,” and warning her that “You just did the stupidest thing ever. Now I’m really going to kill you!” The scandal may have hurt his next album’s sales, but Brown’s career continued unabated, complete with hordes of female fans willing to dismiss or ignore the accusations against him, and to slander anyone who dared tarnish his name—be it his in 2015, or his manager and tour manager in 2016, not to mention infamous outbursts at Good Morning America and one involving his own mother.', '', '', '', 'Following its hour-long critique, Chris Brown: A History of Violence concludes with a half-hour sit-down between The View host Sunny Hostin and a collection of individuals—including Koul, National Domestic Violence Hotline CEO Katie Ray-Jones, No More’s Jane Randel, and 2024 Miss Kansas Alexis Smith, who called out a man she described as her “abuser” on the pageant stage—that further delves into this ongoing societal scourge.', '', '', 'Nick.Schager@thedailybeast.com', 'Got a tip?
