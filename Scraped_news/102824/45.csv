The emotional Moon squares expansive Jupiter, blowing emotions out of proportion and making it hard to know how much is too much. When dynamic Mars trines creative Neptune at 8:31 pm EDT, we can think and act outside the box — as long as we’re careful not to overstep boundaries. When perfectionist Venus argues with critical Saturn, it can feel like our efforts just aren’t good enough, but this isn’t true. Sometimes it’s better to be kind than perfect.', 'March 21 – April 19', 'Added struggles could become difficult to balance. You might have already had a very full to-do list going into today, and any extra tasks or hindrances put on your list may feel like the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Working to keep everything running by coming up with creative solutions is admirable, but it might not be sustainable. Something will probably have to wait till tomorrow. After all, you’re only one person, and you can only get so much done in one day!', 'April 20 – May 20', 'Insecurity can embolden risky behavior. You may feel as if someone is putting you down or leaving you behind, and this could tempt you to lash out at them or try to sabotage the connection in some way. While it could seem like a good idea in the moment, this is likely something that you would regret later. Is this connection really something that you’re willing to throw away over one dispute? Making an effort to work things out will probably be worth it.', 'May 21 – June 20', 'What’s left unsaid goes unheard. You might be feeling left out or like no one is listening to you, but it may be that you were expecting others to understand how you were feeling without actually expressing yourself to them. Maybe you’re struggling to communicate your feelings in the same way that you can communicate about everything else or disguising your real emotions with humor. Don’t force your loved ones to look below the surface — go ahead and spell it out.', 'June 21 – July 22', 'A lack of boundaries can entrap you in places you don’t want to be. You deserve better than people who’d enlist you to work for them with no repayment, especially if their demands are eating into time that you should devote to your hopes and dreams. There may be a side of you that wants to help and give anything you can, but some people will take and take until there’s nothing left. Learn to discern such freeloaders from the ones who really care.', 'July 23 – August 22', 'Someone could trigger your insecurities. Active criticism, general complaints, or simple knowledge of a rival’s success — regardless of the specifics, jealousy probably is starting to creep into your mind. You might feel woefully underachieving or stuck in one place, but stay hopeful! As long as you’re putting in your best efforts, you can find more fulfillment in ignoring or even appreciating the achievements of others while trusting that your day is coming. It’s easier to be happy for someone who was happy for you.', 'August 23 – September 22', 'A hero of yours could let you down. You might have previously patterned yourself after them, whether they’re a family elder or a public figure, but you may be about to realize that you’re, thankfully, not much like them at all. Whether they were deceptive or just recently announced a decision that doesn’t align with your morals, you’ll know where to draw the line regarding their behavior. You can be grateful for their past inspiration, but you no longer have to follow their every lead.', 'September 23 – October 22', 'Curiosity could currently get the better of you. You might be so curious to know more about something that you overlook certain boundaries, which may end up more painful than exciting. Be leery of the temptation to snoop through someone else’s information or to look up the answers to a test when you’re supposed to be studying, as what follows would likely be disappointing, not encouraging. Stick to the straight and narrow, and don’t look somewhere you’ve been asked not to.', 'October 23 – November 21', 'Secrets will be tough to verify. You could learn factoids that are presented as hot gossip or find a leak of information that’s not supposed to come out for weeks. No matter how thrilling the chatter is in the moment, it might not provide you with the genuine truth. Instead of being excited over something you weren’t meant to know, realize that you might have to unlearn it later when it turns out to be overhyped or fake. Wait until you hear from the source.', 'November 22 – December 21', 'Emotions are running high, especially if you’re trying to hide them. You might be trying to hold it together to get through a difficult shift or on behalf of someone else who’s with you, and it can be challenging to keep how you’re feeling inside. After you’re done trying to tough it out, make sure that you carve out time to soften up and share how you’re feeling with someone else, providing space for them to do the same. Venting is great catharsis.', 'December 22 – January 19', 'A lack of consistency could block your progress. You might have been falling behind on certain good habits or your workload, and the cascading consequences of letting something like that fall to the wayside probably aren’t going to be reasonably fixable in a single day. If you have been consistent, today should be a lot easier, but you could encounter obstacles in the form of competition or hidden enemies. Take this as a sign to get back on course if you need to!', 'January 20 – February 18', 'Making your own luck could require some clever maneuvering at the moment. You may have thought that you were doing everything that you needed to usher in abundance, but merely doing things by the book probably won’t be enough right now. You’ll have to use your innovative mind to find fresh, undiscovered ways to get ahead of the crowd, and others might not understand how you’re doing what you’re doing. Let them be confused by your methods and continue to set the trends.', 'February 19 – March 20', 'People that you care about might push your buttons today. You could struggle with your boundaries as they knowingly or unknowingly push them, and having to set them again more firmly could be uncomfortable. They may not understand where you’re coming from — while you can take the time to educate them, you shouldn’t have to. Your boundaries are yours, and if something is important to you, then your loved ones should be able to respect them. Put your foot down if you have to!', '', '', '', 'RECOMMENDED FOR YOU', 'Copyright © 2024 Chicago Tribune']"

In short, be careful what you give your attention to. If it feels bad but you can’t quite put your finger on why, just trust yourself and step back.', 'SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Talk to yourself as you would a friend. Your self-compassion will soar today. Also, talking about yourself in the third person isn’t just for the self-obsessed. Science proves it’s a highly effective way to motivate, soothe or affirm yourself.', 'SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You have your eye on a prize that is not for sale. Is it even winnable? This is a carnival game situation. It’s hard to tell what’s possible in a tradition of trickery. Every once in a while, someone wins. Why shouldn’t it be you?', 'CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Boredom has no place in this day of experimentation. You’ll dive into something new, and if it feels out of character right now, it could soon fall right into your wheelhouse. Practice makes many things possible.', 'AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Actions don’t always have to define you. The worlds of creativity and sport are worlds of play in which you can work out different parts of yourself. Experimentation is welcome. You’ll blossom as you give yourself room to play without judgment.', 'PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Think carefully about your opening move. This is about patterns. Patterns shape life; they form whether we want them to or not. The first mark is the start of it. Some things are better not to start at all.', 'ARIES (March 21-April 19). You’re a master of reframing. A complaint becomes a request. A problem turns into an opportunity. What was once a mishap is now the best part of a story. What was once a flaw has turned into an asset to leverage.', 'TAURUS (April 20-May 20). Life isn’t a simple board game with a clear set of rules. There are countless paths, many unseen until you start asking for advice. Seek out mentors and new directions will unfold before you.', 'GEMINI (May 21-June 21). Your sharp questions will cut through the surface and get to the truth. You might catch someone off guard, which is a good thing -- honesty is the result. What you learn about the past will shift your view of the present and future.', 'CANCER (June 22-July 22). There is such a thing as giving too much. You’ll know it when it throws you off balance. For now, the mission is to hold on to hope. It’s one of those rare gifts, like love, that you can both keep for yourself and share freely with others.', 'LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). You’ve been listening in hopes of understanding the needs of others. Your calm support will be impactful. You will reassure and speak for those who haven’t quite found the right words yet.', 'VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Like a gem in a beautiful setting, you’ll get the balance right -- show a little, guard a little. With your rare sparkle, you’ll walk a line between shining bright and keeping something precious for yourself.', 'LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Spatial awareness isn’t just about symmetry and order. It can also be emotional. You sense the amount of space you need to feel free and balanced in the world. The people who naturally match the requirement will be beautiful to you.', 'TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Oct. 28). The word of the year: abundance. The good fortune keeps rolling in, and as long as you’re keeping track and giving back, it just keeps rolling. Your generosity is thoughtful, stylish and unmistakably you. More highlights: Your decisiveness and speed will serve you well at key moments, and you’ll have the stack of cash to prove it. A strange coincidence will spark a love story. Leo and Virgo adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 4, 10, 2, 28 and 17.', 'CELEBRITY PROFILES: Julia Roberts will star in the upcoming thriller “After the Hunt” directed by Luca Guadagnino.

As communicative Mercury struggles to work with awkward Chiron, discomfort can arise from words that were either miscommunicated or misinterpreted. When Mercury has similar struggles with overconfident Jupiter at 4:50 am EDT, we may open our mouths before thinking things through. Prideful thoughts can stumble into serious verbal blunders! The sensitive Moon is then at odds with both perfectionist Venus and serious Saturn — we might feel like we’re failing to be balanced or consistent. Choose words, and battles, wisely.', 'March 21 – April 19', 'Be careful what you don’t wish for. You could be spending a lot of time talking about what you want to avoid rather than what you crave to achieve, which risks unintentionally damaging your inner drive forward. Continually bringing up your fears, your insecurities, or your dislikes might seem to draw them to you like a magnet, so it’s a better idea to focus on what you do want to keep around or attain. Try speaking with more positivity than you necessarily feel.', 'April 20 – May 20', 'What you don’t say may impact you more than usual. When people in your life are waiting for you to make a statement, the more that you delay, the more anxiety can creep into their minds. You’d be wise to make an intentional effort to set up a time to meet with them in the near future. Even if you aren’t ready to say everything that’s on your mind just yet, you can show them they’re on your mind and you want to connect.', 'May 21 – June 20', 'Certain friends may turn out to be not-so-friendly. Pay attention to your circle — is someone noticeably less happy for you when you succeed or staying quiet during celebrations in a way that doesn’t sit right with you? They may say something today that, one way or another, pushes you over the edge and makes it seem like they’re more satisfied by your failures than your triumphs. You don’t need people like this around you! Don’t hesitate to bring up your concerns.', 'June 21 – July 22', 'Watch what you say to authority figures. Your parents or boss may have a conversation with you that doesn’t sit right with your soul, and it might be difficult to bite your tongue when you want to correct them. Speaking up and facing the responding backlash or staying quiet and potentially regretting your silence later are both options. If possible, step back and contemplate the possible consequences. You may not be able to “win” the situation, but you can mitigate the risk of further conflict.', 'July 23 – August 22', 'Take what you learn with a grain of salt. You may be in a class that is teaching you information that doesn’t quite resonate with your prior knowledge, or someone may be telling you a story without quite sharing all the details. It can be difficult to make your decisions based on this information, so you’d be wise to reserve full judgment until you can obtain more solid facts to go off of. People might sound immensely convincing, but trust your gut.', 'August 23 – September 22', 'Telling tales could get you in trouble. Whether you feel tempted to exaggerate the truth to drive your point home, or you have some gossip that’s so juicy you can hardly contain yourself, it’s important to reel yourself back in and make sure that you’re not speaking out of turn. What you say today could come back to bite you in the near future. You might think it’s inconsequential in the moment, but it’s unlikely to stay that way. Watch your mouth!', 'September 23 – October 22', 'Watch out for what’s being sold to you. There may be someone trying to make you feel secure, but they themselves might not trust what they’re telling you. Maybe they believe that if they’re able to get you on board, everything will work out, but they’re unlikely to be sure. Be aware of who is talking fast and trying to sell you a dream, because it could dissipate as fast as waking up. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!', 'October 23 – November 21', 'You may be tempted to skip any hard work. Today could contain an opportunity to jump a few steps and end up further along than you’re meant to be at this point. Even if you’re certain that you’re capable of going that far, you might not be as ready for the consequences as you think. Consistency and showing up for each step of the journey is a gift to yourself, even when it feels like a slog. Don’t rob yourself of the process.', 'November 22 – December 21', 'Now is not the time to rely on unknowns. If someone’s asking you to take a leap of faith that doesn’t have a safety net below, consider the whole situation. Would going along with them put you more at risk than they are? While they could have the best, most genuine motivations, their ideal results might not have the staying power that you’re both hoping they would. Sometimes you have to be the voice of reason, and this is one of those times.', 'December 22 – January 19', 'Wires can get crossed when people in your life communicate with each other. This is less likely to involve you directly, but tragically likely to get you caught in the middle. Maybe someone that you’ve known for a long time is starting arguments with someone that you don’t know as well, like a family member debating with a new friend. Recognizing where you stand with everyone, regardless of your actual opinion, won’t be simple. Do your best to stay out of the hectic back-and-forth.', 'January 20 – February 18', 'You might have a wide audience to what you’re saying. Your current words could be on a grand stage, whether you’re literally speaking in public or making a statement on social media. This means that it’ll be hard to take back whatever you’re saying, so be certain that you’re using your words carefully and paying attention to public perception of them. Stay tuned in and aware, because a lack of focus can and will cause you to lose face if you’re not careful.', 'February 19 – March 20', 'Watch out for incorrect information!

Don’t be surprised if you’re moody for no apparent reason, or if the people in your life seem unusually sensitive to criticism. This isn’t the time for inflexibility or tough love — everyone, including you, could use some compassion. Don’t be too stubborn to give it.', 'When you’re going through a hard time, your immediate response might be to get angry, or turn it all into a joke, or to pretend that nothing’s wrong. But today, all your usual coping mechanisms might not pack their usual punch. Instead of trying to keep up appearances and convince everyone around you that you’re fine, it might be better now to ask for — and accept — your friends to be gentle with you today. Nobody’s too tough to need kindness, not even you.', 'There’s a part of you that worries you’ve wasted your life. You’re afraid that all the opportunities are behind you, and that if you haven’t reached your goals by now, you never will. Today, it’s easy to convince yourself that all the best moments of your life are in the past — but it isn’t true. There are amazing moments still ahead of you, and it’s your job to notice them when they arrive.', 'Some people always seem to treat you like your ideas, your preferences, and your time don’t matter. It’s maddening to be around them, but there’s also a part of you that sees it as a challenge. You imagine that if you could only show them that you’re a good person, that you’re worth their time, things would change. Maybe it really is possible to change their mind, maybe not — either way, today, stop giving these people your energy. Direct it toward the people who don’t need you to prove that you’re special.', 'Others don’t always give you credit for it, but you’re incredibly good at making things happen. You might go about it in a roundabout way, but you’re far from a passive observer. Today, however, it might be tough to get the ball rolling. Maybe your motivation is low, or maybe external factors are standing in your way. Whatever the issue, trying to force your plans through is likely to end in frustration or worse; sometimes, all you can do is wait.', 'Today you might feel torn: Half of you wants the people in your life to show they care about you, while the other half wants to be left alone. When your friends pay attention to you, you get irritated, and when they don’t, you feel neglected. Nothing anyone does feels good enough, feels right. The answer might be to stop thinking about yourself so much, at least for now. Find something to keep you busy, and by the end of the day, you might find that the mood has passed.', 'No matter how tirelessly you work toward your goals, or how much effort you put into your relationships, or how carefully you work to keep your mind busy, sometimes loneliness catches up to you anyway. You might remind yourself that you’re loved, that there are people you care about deeply, and that your life is filled with meaning, but even that might not be enough to cheer you up. So, for now, the answer might be to lean into the feeling and trust that it won’t last forever.', 'It could be easy for you to come across as unnecessarily negative today, even when you’re being entirely measured and reasonable. But no matter how gently you phrase your criticism, or how sincerely you want to help, others are likely to take it as an attack — and you’ll end up pushed into a position where you have to overexplain yourself or apologize for something benign. If you can, wait a day or two before broaching any sensitive topics.', 'You try to be patient when others are needy or insecure, but it can be hard. You’ve got better things to do than soothe other people’s egos, and there’s a part of you that just wants to tell everybody to get over themselves. Sometimes, this sort of tough talk might be exactly what people need, but not today. If you let your irritation get the better of you now, you could say something you end up regretting, so do your best to stay kind — or to walk away if it’s more than you can handle.', 'Most of the time, self-reflection is a good thing; the more you dig into your feelings, and the better you understand yourself, the more compassionate — and also more productive — you’re able to be. Today, though, useful introspection can quickly turn into unhelpful spiraling. So try getting out of your own head and focusing on other people instead. The more energy you put toward caring for your loved ones or community, the less of it you’ll have to nitpick your own life, and the happier you’ll be.', 'You’re probably the sort of person who can be trusted with a secret: If someone shares a sensitive piece of information with you, they can trust that you won’t spread it around. Because of this, people probably open up to you a lot — not just close friends, but acquaintances and even strangers. Sometimes, though, it gets to be too much; you don’t necessarily want to know so much. Be present for your friends today, but remember you’re allowed your boundaries, too.', ' It might be harder than usual to feel connected with the people in your life today. While you understand each other on a surface level, you’re afraid that your perspectives or values are so different that you’ll never truly understand each other. This isn’t true, though — you might feel strange and isolated, but there are people in the world who get it, who feel just like you. Genuine connection is difficult even at the best of times, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible, so don’t give up.', 'Most of the time, you trust your inner compass to guide you. While you might not care about climbing the professional ladder or following a conventional path, you have a strong sense of purpose all the same. Now, though, it’s easy to start doubting yourself. Does any of this really matter? Have you been wasting your time? But while it can be useful to ask questions, don’t take the answers that come up today too seriously — right now, things probably seem worse than they really are.', '', 'Buy Claire Comstock-Gay’s book, Madame Clairevoyant’s Guide to the Stars, here.', '', 'This story is free for a limited time.
