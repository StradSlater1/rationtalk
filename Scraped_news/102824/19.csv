Cardinal Fernandez proposes ‘step-by-step’ approach to women’s role in the Church,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2024-10/cardinal-fernandez-ddf-female-diaconate-clarification-synod.html,"['By Vatican News', 'Addressing the Synod Assembly on Monday morning, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, explained that his absence at a meeting of Synod delegates last week on the topic of female diaconate was due to a medical procedure undergone by a colleague responsible for coordinating the group.', 'His absence had raised questions in some of the press that suggested it showed a lack of interest in the topic.', 'The Cardinal addressed the issue as part of a broader communication and apologized for what he called a “misunderstanding,” stating that he will be present, together with the study group’s coordinator on October 24 meeting to discuss the study group’s work and address the concerns raised by the participants.', 'According to Cardinal Fernandez,  Pope Francis has expressed that “at this moment the the question of the female diaconate is not ripe”.', '""The commission studying the topic has reached partial conclusions, which will be made public at the appropriate time he explained, adding that the commission, chaired by Cardinal Giuseppe Petrocchi, will continue its work and those who wish to submit proposals or reflections on the topic are encouraged to do so.', 'While the question of female deacons remains unresolved, Cardinal Fernandez stressed that the Pope is deeply concerned about enhancing the role of women in the Church.', ""The Holy Father, he said, has asked the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to explore ways to elevate women's leadership within the Church without focusing exclusively on the Sacrament of Ordination."", 'Cardinal Fernandez argued that focusing solely on the female diaconate would not address the broader issue affecting millions of women in the Church.', ""He pointed out that several steps toward increasing women's roles could already be implemented, and the Church has not fully embraced them."", ""One such example is the ministry of the catechist. After the creation of this new ministry, the Dicastery for Divine Worship sent a letter to episcopal conferences outlining two ways to implement the ministry. One option involved catechists leading the teaching of the faith, while the second aligned with Pope Francis' vision in Querida Amazonia, where women lead communities in the absence of priests, taking on roles of leadership and responsibility. However, Cardinal Fernandez noted, only a small number of episcopal conferences chose this second option."", ""Similarly, he added, the ministry of acolyte, now available to women, has been granted in only a small percentage of dioceses, and he said this was often due to local priests' reluctance to nominate women for the role."", 'He also criticized the limited adoption of the male diaconate in many parts of the world, noting that, in some places, deacons are perceived merely as ""ordained altar boys.""', ""These examples, he said, illustrate that rushing to ordain women as deacons is not the most pressing solution to promoting women's participation in the Church."", 'Instead, Cardinal Fernandez emphasized the need for deeper, more inclusive reflections on how women can assume leadership roles in the Church without being restricted by the traditional understanding of priestly power.', 'As part of his call for greater inclusion of women, Cardinal Fernandez urged synod members, especially the women, to share testimonies and proposals with the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.', ""He asked for stories of women who have assumed leadership roles within their communities, not as a result of imposed structures, but because of the needs of the people and the prompting of the Holy Spirit. “Reality is superior to the idea,” he remarked, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and affirming women's existing contributions to Church life."", ""Thus, the Cardinal pledged to gather and listen to these contributions, and he committed to facilitating a discussion on the role of women in the Church during Thursday’s assembly, and he reassured participants that concerns about the procedural aspects of the synod would also be addressed during that session, along with more information about the Vatican study group's members."", ""In his concluding remarks, Cardinal Fernandez expressed confidence that the Church can make concrete progress in promoting women's leadership roles through a step-by-step approach."", '""There is nothing in the nature of women that prevents them from holding very important positions in the leadership of the Church,"" he affirmed, adding that what comes from the Holy Spirit cannot be stopped.', 'Thank you for reading our article.

Not a silent Church, but a Church that embraces the cry of humanity. Not a blind Church, but a Church, enlightened by Christ, that brings the light of the Gospel to others. Not a static Church, but a missionary Church that walks with her Lord through the streets of the world,” he said.', 'The Mass marked the conclusion of the second assembly of the 16th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, which began on Oct. 2 and focused on the theme “For a Synodal Church: Communion, Participation, and Mission.”', 'The assembly represented a significant phase in the Church’s global synodal process, initiated three years ago. Over the last month, synod delegates produced a 52-page final document outlining recommendations for Church renewal, including proposals for expanded women’s leadership roles, greater lay participation in decision-making, and significant structural reforms.', 'In a notable departure from tradition, Pope Francis announced that he will forgo issuing a postsynodal apostolic exhortation. Instead, he opted to ratify the synod’s final document, directly implementing the assembly’s conclusions. While the synod assembly has ended, 10 synod study groups will continue to examine the question of women deacons and other key topics through June 2025.', 'In his homily, Pope Francis reflected on the Gospel of Mark’s account of Jesus healing a blind man named Bartimaeus. He said that “blind Bartimaeus … represents that inner blindness which restrains us, keeps us stuck in one place, holds us back from the dynamism of life, and destroys our hope.”', '“So many things along the way can make us blind, incapable of perceiving the presence of the Lord, unprepared to face the challenges of reality, sometimes unable to offer adequate responses  to the questions of so many who cry out to us,” the pope said.', '“A sedentary Church, that inadvertently withdraws from life and confines itself to the margins of reality, is a Church that risks remaining blind and becoming comfortable with its own unease,” he said. “If we remain stuck in our blindness, we will continuously fail to grasp the urgency of giving a pastoral response to the many problems of our world.”', 'Pope Francis, dressed in green vestments for the 30th Sunday in Ordinary Time, delivered his homily slowly, often pausing to speak off the cuff. He described an image of a “synodal Church” as one in which “the Lord is calling us, lifting us up when we are seated or fallen down, restoring our sight so that we can perceive the anxieties and sufferings of the world in the light of the Gospel.”', '“Let us remember never to walk alone or according to worldly criteria,” he added, but instead to journey by “following Jesus along the road.”', 'At the altar, Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary-general of the General Secretariat of the Synod, served as the principal celebrant.', '(Story continues below)', 'I agree to receive other communications from EWTN and consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy.', 'More than 300 priests and bishops, 70 cardinals, and nine patriarchs concelebrated the synod’s closing Mass under the canopy of the recently restored baldacchino over the central altar.', 'The 400-year-old intricate bronze canopy designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini was revealed at the Mass for the first time since restoration, its twisted columns gleaming with intricately decorated Baroque angels, cherubs, bees, and golden laurel branches.', '“As we admire Bernini’s majestic baldacchino, more sublime than ever, we can rediscover that it frames the true focal point of the entire basilica, namely the glory of the Holy Spirit,” the pope said. “This is the synodal Church: a community whose primacy lies in the gift of the Spirit, who makes us all brothers and sisters in Christ and raises us up to him.”', 'As the Mass concluded, Pope Francis, from his wheelchair, led the faithful in the veneration of a relic of St. Peter’s chair — a wooden throne symbolizing the papal primacy. This relic is expected to remain on display in St. Peter’s Basilica for public veneration until Dec. 8.', '“Today, as we give thanks to the Lord for the journey we have made together, we will be able to see and venerate the relic of the carefully restored ancient chair of St. Peter,” Pope Francis said. “As we contemplate it with the wonder of faith, let us remember that this is the chair of love, the chair of unity, and the chair of mercy.”', '', 'Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.', 'From its magisterial status to proposals on Church governance, here are answers to the most pressing questions about the Synod on Synodality’s final document.', 'The text also addresses accountability measures, calling for enhanced financial transparency, and protocols for abuse prevention.', 'Pope Francis has announced that the final Synod on Synodality document will be adopted without a traditional papal exhortation.', 'CNA is a service of EWTN News, Inc.']"

And it has to be capable of development, while at the same time remaining faithful to its mission and to the revelation that has been communicated to it. This is hard. This is what’s happening.”', 'While Catholic women participated over the past month in what many consider the most significant Catholic gathering since the 1960s — called the “synod on synodality” — many of their number were let down by a Vatican decision to sideline talk of the ordination of female priests or deacons, instead referring the matter to a future study group.', 'Bridget Mary Meehan, an American co-founder of the Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests, told VOA that her organization has performed 270 ordinations of women in 14 countries since its creation in 2002.', '“We wanted to share with Pope Francis that it is time to build a bridge between the international women priests’ movement and the Vatican,” she said. “We are on the same page as he is about a synodal church. We believe all are called, all are equal and all are co-responsible for the mission of the church — to be the face of Christ in the world in loving and compassionate service. One of these ways is ordained ministry.”', 'Advocates say women play a huge role in daily Catholic ministries — also called the diakonia — in education, pastoral care and hospitals worldwide. In some places, women are especially active because there are no priests, such as in the Amazon. But often their leadership is not recognized.', 'Meehan “ordained” six Catholic women from France, Spain and the United States on a barge on Rome’s Tiber River earlier this month to acknowledge their central role in ministry around the world.', '“We did it because we felt that it’s time for us, after 22 years of serving the church in the diakonia ministry, to really share the good news that women are being ordained by Catholic communities who want to call them forward to ministry among them,” Meehan said.', '“It’s like a renewal of ministry that is already in the midst of the Catholic Church. It’s already occurring,” she said.', 'Although Pope Francis has appointed more women to top jobs at the Vatican than any of his predecessors, he has ruled out female priests or deacons ministering in the Catholic Church.', '']"

According to synod sources, it is divided into five parts.', 'The first part deals with the shared understanding of synodality and its theological principles. The second concerns what is called a “relational conversion.” The third part speaks of ecclesial discernment, decision-making processes, the culture of transparency, accountability, and evaluation. The fourth part seeks to understand how to cultivate the exchange of gifts in new ways. Finally, the fifth part speaks of formation in and for missionary synodality.', 'The synod’s final document, one delegate told CNA, appears to be strongly borrowed from the document on synodality that the International Theological Commission published in 2018, titled “Synodality in the Life and Mission of the Church.”', 'After reviewing it the synod delegates can propose amendments, which the assembly will discuss and vote on this Saturday.', 'Two-thirds of the assembly must approve a paragraph for it to be retained. In the past, if a paragraph did not reach even two-thirds, it would not be published. It was said that it did not represent synodal communion. Pope Francis has instead wanted each paragraph of the final document to be published and that votes for or against be indicated together with the paragraph. ', 'Beyond the talks about healthy decentrality, the draft document addresses how this decentralization should be addressed. In particular, there is a paragraph that says that in a synodal Church, the decision-making competence of the bishop and of the bishop of Rome is “inalienable” while proposing some good practices to make the diocesan and parish council representative of all the people of God, women included.', 'Some describe the document as interlocutory rather than definitive. One bishop observed that “the document allows everyone to manage things as they wish.” But, he added, showing some disappointment, “So what were we discussing?”', 'If these are the results of two synodal stages in Rome and a three-year journey of dialogue and listening before that, it’s clear that many will be disappointed.

Synod: Cardinal Grech's homily for Mass of the Holy Spirit - Full text,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2024-10/cardinal-mario-grech-mass-homily-synod-on-synodality.html,"['Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit\n21 October 2024\nHOMILY OF CARDINAL MARIO GRECH\nSecretary General of the Synod', 'Dear brothers and sisters,', 'We have reached the final stretch of the work of our Synodal Assembly, which gathers the fruits of a long journey that began in October 2021. Right now, the Gospel passage shows us the way to “gather” and Jesus invites us to beware of all covetousness, and this may concern not only material goods, but the good and beauty that Jesus is entrusting to us in this Synod.', 'Jesus\' parable is inspired by a question that is asked of him. A man asks him to be the judge - this is the function that the rabbis of Jesus\' time could have had - between him and his brother to \'divide\' the inheritance. But Jesus does not respond positively to his interlocutor\'s question. This may seem strange to us. Is it not right to divide the inheritance between brothers? Is it not right for each to take his share and go his own way? Of course, for us, it is normal; it is what we are tempted to do, but not for Jesus. For him, the ideal is not that the inheritance be divided, but that it be kept intact, with shared administration. Jesus refuses to divide, but invites us to seek communion, since he identifies greed and the pursuit of possession as the root of division. Jesus rejects all logic of partisanship and division in the search for communion among brothers and sisters. This is why he then tells the parable, so that everyone can realize the ""foolishness"" behind the desire to hoard in barns. The parable shows us how to prepare ourselves in these days to reap the fruits of our synodal journey and of our assembly, without dividing ourselves, but seeking communion.', 'Let us follow the parable. ""There was once a rich man who had a good harvest."" The parable begins with a positive fact: there is an abundant harvest to rejoice over. We too in these three years and in the two sessions of the Synodal Assembly can say that we have been able to discover ""abundant fruits."" We have rejoiced at the signs of vitality in each phase of the synodal journey, starting with the listening that characterized the first phase and involved all our communities. Our journey has been rich in fruits: it has helped us to see the gifts that are flourishing in the people of God today, without hiding our frailties and wounds. But as disciples of the Risen Lord, we have been able to recognize that it is precisely in our weakness that God\'s strength is manifested (cf. 2 Cor 12:9).', 'Faced with this abundant harvest, the owner of the field wonders: ""What shall I do, since I have nowhere to put my crops?"" The owner wonders how to manage the fruits of his fields and realizes he has no suitable or sufficiently large storehouses. He is faced with a new situation; he discovers he has wealth that he could not have foreseen and it seems to him that he does not have the means to accumulate it and store it safely. We too, faced with the abundant fruits of the synodal journey, might ask ourselves the same question: what to do now? What to do with the abundant fruits we have gathered over these years? Perhaps we too, like the man in the parable, might realize that we do not have the proper means to guard the gifts we have discovered. Or perhaps, we see it, like the man in the parable, as the achievement of a goal: now there is nothing more to be done, we just have to enjoy the fruits we have received.', ""In fact, he thinks to himself, 'I will demolish my storehouses and build bigger ones and gather all my grain and goods there.' This is the solution of someone who feels fulfilled. His solution is: build bigger warehouses. Not only does he use an old, familiar solution, even if slightly modified - he had small storehouses, he builds bigger ones - but he reasons according to the logic of someone who feels fulfilled. You just have to build a bigger warehouse. He is someone who wants to live off his earnings. He does not think that perhaps, in order to make use of the goods he has at his disposal, it is necessary to continue working, to explore new solutions, to see how the field develops. For the man in the parable, the harvested fruit is the end point. He is partially right, but not totally. They are also the starting point. The human being dies when he feels he has arrived and feels fulfilled. "", 'He says to himself: ""My soul, you have plenty of good things laid by for many years to come; take things easy, eat, drink, have a good time."" He does not think of investing, of broadening his view, of making his possessions fruitful, but simply of living off his earnings. He rejoices in his completeness! We too could run the risk of doing as this man did: hoarding what we have collected, the gifts from God that we have discovered, without reinvesting them, without living them as gifts received that we must now give back to the Church and the world, of feeling we have arrived!', 'We too may be content, without looking for new ways for our harvest to multiply further; we too may risk remaining closed within our known boundaries, without continuing to enlarge the space of our tent, as the prophet Isaiah invited us to do: ""Enlarge the space of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitation be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes"" (Is 54:2). We too can run the risk of living off our earnings. But the understanding of truths and pastoral choices go on, consolidate with the years, develop with time, deepen with age.', 'But how can we avoid falling into the error of the man in the parable, so as not to try to live off our earnings? Dear brothers and sisters, to do this there is one thing to avoid and one path to take. First of all, we must heed the words of Jesus: ""Watch, and be on your guard against avarice of any kind, for a man’s life is not made secure by what he owns, even when he has more than he needs."" As we close the work of our Assembly and look to the path that lies ahead of us, we must keep ourselves from covetousness, from the desire to keep everything for ourselves, to possess, to hoard, to define, to close. We must overcome the temptation to believe that the fruits we have harvested are our work and our possession: we must receive everything as a gift from God.', 'And what is the way forward? We are celebrating the Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit. The way to take is that of the Spirit of God. In fact, only the Holy Spirit can enable us to remain open to the newness of God. The Holy Father already reminded us of this at the beginning of the synodal journey: ""the Synod is not a parliament or an opinion poll; the Synod is an ecclesial event and its protagonist is the Holy Spirit. If the Spirit is not present, there will be no Synod"" (Address, 9 October 2021). The man in the parable only listens and speaks to himself. We, on the other hand - individually and in community, as in a continuous Pentecost - must ""dialogue"" with the Holy Spirit, allow ourselves to be enlightened by him, waiting for that ""overflow"" that is the sign of his intervention. If we only listen to ourselves, if we turn in on ourselves, we will live off our earnings, without hope. Little by little, what we have gathered will begin to disappear, without being replaced by the new things that the Lord will continue to send us. If, on the other hand, we listen to the voice of the Spirit, then we will be able to identify new paths and ""as pilgrims of hope let us continue to advance along the synodal path towards those who still await the proclamation of the Good News of salvation!"" (IL 112) If we listen to the voice of the Spirit, the conclusion of this synodal assembly will not be the end of something, but a new beginning, so that ""the Word of God may spread and be glorified"" (2 Thess 3:1).', 'Dear brothers and sisters, with Mary, to whom we have entrusted the work of our Assembly from the very beginning, if we know how to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit and live in the freedom of the Spirit, we will be able to sing to the Lord the hymn of praise that the prophet Isaiah points out to us: ""this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation"" (Is 25:9; IL 112).', 'Thank you for reading our article.

He also stated that this question, although Pope Francis considers it not “mature,” is not a “closed issue.”', 'To delve deeper into the differences between holy orders and authority in order to be able to entrust laywomen with leadership functions in the Church is, according to Fernández, the objective of the work of the group he leads at the Synod on Synodality to reflect on the role of women in the Church at the request of the Holy Father.', 'Fernández made the statement during a meeting on Thursday afternoon with about 100 members, guests, and experts participating in the synod to hear their questions and proposals regarding the work of group 5.', 'This meeting was called at the initiative of the cardinal in response to some members being frustrated by his absence from a meeting scheduled for last week.', 'According to reports and the audio shared after the meeting, Fernández emphasized that the majority of women want to “be heard and valued,” are asking to “have authority” and to be able to develop their charisms without specifically requesting the female diaconate, since they do not want to be “clericalized.”', '“I am thinking of women theologians who in some parts of the world have no opportunity for development or real freedom for theological work ... of women who have gifts for leading communities ... or of women who have great capacity to advise like the best of consultants or spiritual directors but who are not accepted because they don’t have holy orders,” he added.', 'The cardinal was also asked about the possibility of this matter being the main theme of the next synod. “I don’t know what the procedures are for proposing the next themes, it’s not my job, but perhaps it will be one of the themes proposed” at the end of this synod, he replied.', 'Fernández also noted that “the experience of the Amazon” is “very important” for this study because of the existence, he said, “of an experience of communities led by women without any priests.”', '“This experience is very important for us and we have already consulted some women” who belong “to groups of laypeople who constantly visit the communities.”', 'The idea of the ministries, he continued, “is not a decision of the bishop who chooses a woman friend for an important position, but there is a need in the community and that there is in some persons a gift that responds to that need.”', '“We must be careful with this so as not to create a structure that ultimately remains dependent on [having] authority,” he said. ', 'In this regard, the DDF prefect said it is possible to “have a significant consensus” regarding the leadership roles of women in the Church while noting that “very concrete steps will be taken in this regard.”', '“If it turns out that in the past women preached during the celebration of the Eucharist or exercised authority without having been ordained deacons, does this count for less?” the cardinal asked the members of the synod.', 'With the aim of carrying out a more open consultation following a “synodal style,” the Argentine cardinal renewed his invitation to send contributions and proposals to the Vatican dicastery.', '“Honestly, we need to receive ideas and proposals because we try to interpret the needs and possibilities that women see, but not being a woman I don’t have their experience. So we need to understand where we can go on these concrete paths for women’s empowerment.”', 'To do this, the cardinal said that “the help of concrete proposals with which we can take real steps forward is really needed. What I’ve heard today seemed very, very interesting to me and it has opened my mind a little to other ideas.”', '“I’m not known in the Church for being a closed-minded medieval, am I? So you can be sure that I have an open heart to see where the Holy Spirit leads us and we move forward,” he added.', 'Although the female diaconate has been removed from the central debates of the synod, the cardinal insisted that those who “are convinced that it is necessary to go deeper” into this question can also send their considerations to the commission chaired by Cardinal Giuseppe Petrocchi to further explore the subject.', 'He said that this body, established by the Holy Father in 2020, will resume its work with even “more effort” under the impetus of the proposals sent by the members of the synodal assembly and from other parts of the world.', 'Also, regarding Pope Francis’ position on the question of the diaconate, which he said was “not mature,” Fernández pointed out that this does not mean that Francis wants to “close the issue.”', 'This reflection will also continue, according to the cardinal, because “the conclusions of the commission’s work are not without ambiguity and there are historians who say that in the past there were cases of women being ordained as deaconesses,” while other historians claim that it was “a blessing and not a true ordination.”', 'This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

Vatican meeting ends and hope fades for more change under Francis,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/26/vatican-synod-women-deacons-married-priests-lgbtq/,"['The pope’s “Synod on Synodality” ended Saturday without progress on female deacons, married priests or LGBTQ+ outreach.', 'VATICAN CITY — The Vatican’s most highly anticipated gathering since the 1960s ended Saturday with the thorniest issues facing the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics largely unanswered.', 'The Synod of Bishops, which met in October 2023 and again this month, pledged administrative changes that could give more power to local dioceses. But it referred questions on the ordination of female deacons, further outreach to the LGBTQ+ community and married priests for further study.', 'The outcome calmed the fears of church conservatives that Pope Francis’s “Synod on Synodality” would serve as a smokescreen for radical change while leaving liberals, who had seen it as their best opportunity since Vatican II to promote reform, empty-handed for now.', '“It’s hard to say whether this synod has actually taken any decision,” said Massimo Faggioli, a Catholic theologian at Villanova University.', 'The document that it produced amounts to a set of guidelines on a range of challenges. On the abuse crisis, for example, the synod concluded that “it is necessary to [offer] training for those working with minors and vulnerable adults.” On hostility toward migrants: “All … are called to build intercultural communities.” On transparency and accountability in the church, “it is necessary to have structures and methods for regularly evaluating the exercise of ministry.”', 'Other issues were taken off the table and sent to study groups before the second and final session of the multiyear event opened this month. The 10 groups are supposed to report back with their findings in June.', 'It remains unclear whether and how Francis will respond. The most unconventional pope in modern history has in the past year taken polemic steps — most notably backing brief blessings by priests of same-sex couples. There are proposals he has publicly opposed and on which he appears unlikely to change his mind, including the ordination of women deacons or married priests.', 'But unlike his predecessors, Francis, 87, has not shut those conversations down.', '“He is the pope of surprises,” said the Rev. Thomas Reese, an American priest who has written several books about the inner workings of the Catholic Church. “I don’t think he’s done, but I don’t know what he’s going do. I don’t think that anyone does.”', 'In an unusual move, Francis wrapped up the synod by announcing that he wouldn’t follow up its final document with an apostolic exhortation: “What we have approved is enough.”', 'Roberto de Mattei, president of the conservative Catholic Lepanto Foundation, said the synod had “managed to make everyone unhappy.”', '“That’s perhaps especially true for liberals, some of whom were expecting a Vatican III,” he said. “Well, this wasn’t it.”', 'Vatican II was the council convened in 1962 to modernize the church for an increasingly secular world. It ordered epochal revisions — changing the language of the Mass, turning the priest around to face the people and promoting interfaith dialogue, among others.', 'Before Francis’s synod, the Vatican worked to temper expectations, calling it a listening exercise more than anything else and a chance for the global church to dialogue. Its makeup was historic: The church’s leading consultative body was previously reserved for senior clerics; now, for the first time, lay people, including women, were given votes.', 'In announcing the synod in 2021, Francis asked regional churches to name topics they wanted discussed. They included the elevation of the role of women and whether and how to minister to divorced Catholics, the LBGTQ+ community and polygamists. Regional churches asked for more concrete steps to prevent clerical sexual abuse and offer justice to victims. But from the beginning, victims’ rights groups denounced the synod, saying it wasn’t taking the issue seriously enough.', 'An initial session a year ago revealed deep divisions, particularly over LGBTQ+ Catholics and female deacons. With those issues off the agenda before the start of this month’s session, the atmosphere, delegates said, appeared more amicable.', '“Of course, because everything important was taken off the table,” one delegate said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door synod.', 'In a final document released Saturday, the synod wrote that “the question of women’s access to diaconal ministry remains open. This discernment needs to continue.” The body also called for “giving more space to the contributions of female saints, theologians and mystics.”', 'The role of women in the church, specifically the question of ordaining women as deacons, became one of the gathering’s most divisive topics.', 'On Oct. 18, during what synod delegates thought would be an informational meeting on the study group on the role of women, the Vatican put forward two nonmember “ambassadors” who were unable to answer most questions. Some delegates were angered by what they saw as a dismissal of the topic.', 'To address their frustration, Cardinal Victor Fernandez, the head of the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith, met with those delegates Thursday.', 'Francis is on the record opposing the ordination of women as deacons. On Thursday, however, Fernandez said the pope was open to more study on the issue and a preexisting church commission would continue to examine the topic.', 'But the new study group, he said, would only look at how to expand women’s “power” within the church as part of the laity. He said women want to be heard and valued, but most were not asking to be ordained.', 'Serving as deacons, Fernandez said, would be “cumbersome for the lay work they do.”', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

The officials reportedly distributed slips of paper with an email address for submitting feedback and could not answer most questions posed by delegates.', 'The Pillar reported that in a statement to synod participants late on Oct. 18, Fernández said he was “sorry for the misunderstanding” and that his absence was “due not to any unwillingness but to my objective inability to attend on the scheduled day and time.”', 'The cardinal added that he had previously indicated two dicastery officials would attend the meeting in his place.

The pope has clarified that he will not be issuing an apostolic exhortation, as had been customary for previous synods, so this Final Document is indeed the final word for now.', 'The following is a statement from Francis DeBernardo, New Ways Ministry’s Executive Director, on the document and this Synod’s conclusion. Bondings 2.0 will provide further coverage throughout this week.', 'ROME—For a second time, the Synod’s General Assembly failed to include LGBTQ+ issues in its Final Document, despite the Catholic faithful persistently naming it a top priority. Such an omission will certainly disappoint many pro-LGBTQ+ Catholics who hoped for positive change through this synodal process. But while the Final Document falls short, the synodal process has prepared fertile ground for change. New Ways Ministry urges Catholics not to despair, but to continue their work for justice and equality.', 'The laity of the church must now become louder and more vigorous than ever in advocating for reform. The synodal process’ best outcome is its reaffirmation of Vatican II’s strong call that the entire people of God be co-responsible for the Church and involved at every level in decision making. Catholic LGBTQ+ advocates must not let dashed hopes about greater reform through the Synod impede them from becoming more involved in ecclesial governance.', 'Regardless of this Final Document, the work remains to build Catholicism into “a home for all,” as Pope Francis has envisioned.', 'Authoritarian popes from 1978 to 2013 stifled any real discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in the Church, even at the highest levels. Now, it will take time for Catholicism to grow into a synodal mode. This challenge is made more difficult because many bishops, particularly in the U.S., were appointed by the two previous popes and share their autocratic tendencies even now.  Canon law must be sufficiently revised to make lay involvement and wide consultation mandatory or such intransigent bishops and Church leaders will not change.', 'When asked at Synod press conferences this month about the possibility of such stonewalling, speaker after speaker encouraged lay people to take synodal initiatives even if none are forthcoming from the leaders of their dioceses or parishes. These past three years have shown that synodality is the path forward for the Church, and it will not be denied.', 'The Synod on Synodality as a whole remains a landmark moment in Church history for LGBTQ+ Catholics. For the first time at a global level, the concerns and desires of queer people and allies were not only voiced, but intently listened to by Vatican leaders. The synodal process made clear that LGBTQ+ inclusion is a key concern for the faithful. During more than two years of consultations on every continent and at every level, Catholics let their leaders know that the time has come for discrimination and exclusion to end.', 'Never again can it be said that LGBTQ+ inclusion in the church is a niche issue or dismissed as simply a Western concern. Never again can the institutional Church pretend to not know the harm that has been done or the paths forward being offered. This synodal journey made plain that the people of God long for a church that welcomes every person, inclusive of every sexual and gender identity.', 'Along with many other pressing concerns expressed by the faithful, the General Assembly this month failed to respond adequately to LGBTQ+ Catholics and allies. Because the Assembly lacked transparency about its proceedings and accountability to the wider Church, we don’t know how or why this happened. We know that some LGBTQ-positive delegates strove to raise these issues, but the responses to them from other delegates remains a mystery. Clearly, they were hampered by Pope Francis and Synod leaders’ preemptive decision to remove LGBTQ+ inclusion and other issues deemed too controversial from the Assembly’s agenda. In short, the Synod General Assembly failed to be synodal.', 'Catholic LGBTQ+ ministry has been carried out in a synodal way long before the wider Church understood synodality’s value. LGBTQ+ ministry for decades has been premised on encounter, listening, reciprocal education, and collaborative decision-making. Catholic LGBTQ+ advocates are well-versed in these methods and well-aware of their fruits.', 'The work of synodal dialogue will allow the church to be further converted by the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ Catholics. This month’s Synod Assembly, and indeed the three years of this Synod on Synodality, are only the beginning of a longer process—and so Catholics must ensure that implementing structural reforms proceeds robustly, transparently, and with integrity.', '—Francis DeBernardo, New Ways Ministry, October 27, 2024', 'For Bondings 2.0’s full coverage of the Synod on Synodality by clicking here.

Homilies were preached, meetings were held, and each program petered out and died. The promised renewals never blossomed.', 'The only one program that did have an effect, was the one that addressed the hurt that African American people had experienced at the hands of the Church. Parishioners met and discussed with each other and with the parish staff what they had suffered. It was a cathartic process.', 'In the now ending synodal process, lots of people have shared the pains and hurt they have experienced as queer people. A woman who facilitated the synodal meetings in the archdiocese where I had served, said the largest gathering was for LGBTQ people. She was straight, but was deeply moved and enlightened by the testimony of the people who attended.', 'Yet here we are now, with the synod ending, and women and queer people referred to some committees which may or may not carry forward to completion some serious work on our concerns. And the Church that claims to be carrying on the teaching and example of Jesus, and that claims to be following the Spirit, continues to be mired in age-old prejudices.', 'I still hold out hope that the seeds that have been planted and have been watered by sweat and tears, will bear fruit. I hope the synodal way will not be just another promised reform that dies on the vine.', 'I do think, Francis, that your words – “The laity of the church must now become louder and more vigorous than ever in advocating for reform” – are words of wisdom. Maybe the synod could not or would not address the discrimination and demands of those who have suffered. But we must continue to cry out and demand justice.', 'One thing that gives me hope is that the work New Ways Ministry has been doing these last fifty years has been heard and recognized by Pope Francis.

The current assembly, including most of the same members, began with a Mass at the Vatican Oct. 2.', 'Members voted on each of the 155 paragraphs of the document, which made suggestions and requests to Pope Francis that included long-term projects, such as continuing discernment about the possibility of women deacons, the need to reform seminary training and the hope that more lay people would be involved in the selection of bishops.', 'But they also included actions that could and should be implemented immediately, including hiring more women and laymen to teach in seminaries or having bishops make pastoral councils mandatory for every parish and pastors ensuring those bodies are truly representative of the parish members and that he listens to their advice.', 'Synod officials said all the paragraphs were approved by the necessary two-thirds of synod members present and voting; 355 members were present and voting, so passage required 237 votes.

Alwan explained that Christian hope is not mere superficial optimism.', 'The Cross, he said, is not the last word.

Furthermore, Catholic teaching bars women from ordination to the priesthood, a decision that Francis has maintained, although he has allowed studies of female deacons.', 'During previous papacies the question of ordaining women was not even up for discussion. The big difference now is that the 87-year-old Argentinian pontiff has shown he is willing to listen carefully to the voices of Catholics.', 'In a significant move, Francis, for the first time, said he would not issue a teaching document following the Vatican synod recommendations and approved their decisions, giving them added authority. “It’s a revolution that no one notices,” one cardinal told CNN afterwards about the pope’s move.', 'During his pontificate, Francis has also been trying to make cracks in the Vatican’s glass ceiling. He has chosen women to senior positions in the church’s central administration, including a religious sister to help run the synod and the first women members to sit on the board of a powerful Vatican department that decides on bishop appointments.', 'For the first time, women were also included as voting members, with 54 female voters among more around 360 delegates. One of those was Julia Oseka, 23, who is studying theology and physics at St Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is the youngest woman ever to be a voting member of a Vatican synod.', '“There’s definitely an urgent need to not only realize and accept that women have an equal baptismal dignity to men in the Catholic Church, but also to take action,” she told CNN.', 'Oseka added that while she sometimes felt “frustrated” about the “slow pace” of decisions, some parts of the church “struggle” when it comes to the inclusion of women, and it was important to maintain unity.', 'Francis’ approach is also informed by the resistance to any reform to women’s roles: The declaration from the Vatican assembly on women received 97 “no” votes, the most of any section in the final document.', '“There is resistance because there is still fear of this co-responsibility in the Catholic Church. But the participation and the role of the women is really a key issue,” Helena Jeppesen-Spuhler, a church worker from Switzerland and voting delegate, told CNN.', 'She said the pope had recognized that the question of female deacons cannot be “closed” and that it was important for the Catholic Church to send a message to the world where there is rising discrimination and violence against women.  “If we don’t take a strong stand, it’s contradicting our own message,” she said.', 'For some, the pope and church leaders are not going far enough. “Women are looking for concrete changes and reforms that urgently recognize their equality,” Kate McElwee, the executive director of Women’s Ordination Worldwide, told CNN. “How much longer must women wait?”', 'Nevertheless, for a church which thinks in centuries what may seem like small steps to those on the outside are major leaps forward for many inside.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Outside, reform groups have released critical statements about the fact that major shifts appear unlikely to happen.', 'And some are critiquing synod organizers for setting synodal expectations that have not been met by reality.', '“We are told repeatedly that this synod is about a new way of being church,” wrote Zac Davis in America magazine, the U.S. Jesuits’ flagship publication. “I worry that many Catholics will come away from this process disillusioned if the new way leads to the same results.”', 'The disappointment for more progressive Catholics has been accentuated by Pope Francis’ decision to take “hot-button” topics related to women and sexual teaching off the final session’s agenda and give them to dedicated study groups.', 'Dissatisfaction morphed into near dissent when Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, head of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and leader of the group studying the possibility of ordaining women as deacons, failed to show up at an Oct. 18 meeting with delegates after he had previously told them that there “is still no room for a positive decision” on the question.', 'But the Vatican’s decision to table the controversial issues only came after organizers initially had given many the impression that every issue would be up for discussion and encouraged input from groups that openly dissent from settled Church teaching.', 'During the early stages of the 2021-2024 synod, progressive Catholic activists and theologians repeatedly presented the synod as an opportunity to usher in major changes. Synod organizers and communications partners tended not to correct these narratives, while labeling those who raised concerns about this version of synodality as moved by fear.', 'In one notable instance of setting dramatic expectations, Sister Nathalie Becquart, undersecretary of the Secretariat of the Synod, frequently repeated the claim that the Synod on Synodality “is the most important ecclesial event after the Second Vatican Council.”', 'That claim about its significance had previously been made in 2021 by the progressive theologian Massimo Faggioli, who has said it is a “hypocrisy” that the Church does not have female deacons, and Sister Nathalie repeated it in articles and presentations throughout 2022.', 'At other times, synod organizers have spoken of the process as a representative consultation of the People of God, capable of gauging the “sense of the faithful,” despite the fact that in several countries less than 1% of Catholics participated in listening sessions.', 'Synod organizers have since attempted to tamp down on grandiose expectations, but hopes for dramatic changes from the event have persisted.', 'As Andrea Gagliarducci noted in the Register’s pages at the start of the synod’s final session, the real challenge facing organizers this month would be “how to manage the expectations of those hoping and pushing for sweeping changes.”', 'And even as far back as October 2023, Stephen White of The Catholic University of America noted that “a synod communications and marketing strategy that promises novelty and presupposes change” had already set some up to feel like they’d been “sold a bill of goods.”', '“Expectations for the synod — expectations both hopeful and fearful — have grown so great that it is increasingly difficult to imagine an outcome for the synod that doesn’t leave large parts of the Church feeling hoodwinked,” White wrote at the time.', 'Perhaps anticipating the discontent of some with the direction the synod seems to be heading, Cardinal-designate Timothy Radcliffe gave an Oct. 21 reflection to the assembly, calling for all to have “interior freedom” in the face of a possibly unsatisfying outcome.', '“We may be disappointed with the decisions of the synod,” the papally appointed spiritual guide of the synod said. “Some of us will consider these to be ill-advised or even wrong.”', 'Cardinal-designate Radcliffe added that “God’s providence is gently, silently at work,” even when things appear to go off track.', 'The former master of the Dominican order, who Pope Francis will create a cardinal on Dec. 7, followed this reflection up with comments at a press conference that discouraged those reading the forthcoming final document from looking for big changes.', '“I think maybe the temptation of many people, including the press, is to look for startling decisions — headlines,” he said. “But I think that is a mistake. Because I think the synod is about a deep renewal of the Church in a new situation.”', 'Davis at America, however, questioned this guidance after years of synod organizers attempting to promote the event as a seismic shift.', '“At the end of a multi-year process that has asked the entire Church and beyond to contribute time and resources,” he wrote, “is it really too much to ask for a headline or two?”', ""Jonathan Liedl Jonathan Liedl is senior editor for the Register.

That’s because the Church’s divine mission, granted to it nearly 2,000 years ago by Jesus himself, is the salvation of souls. And nothing, including who wins control of the White House for the next four years, can ever be as crucial as our eternal destiny.', 'Since the start of his papacy, Pope Francis has proclaimed the need for a more synodal Church, one that gives a much greater voice to the laity and listens with greater attentiveness to all of humanity — including estranged Catholics, the adherents of other religions, and those who don’t believe in God at all. Armed by this attentiveness, the Holy Father believes, the Church of the third millennium will be far better equipped to serve as a “field hospital” to today’s confused and hurting world. ', 'That’s certainly an inspirational vision, yet it remains unclear what impact the Synod on Synodality will have on the Church’s core mission. As the four-year formal synodal process draws to a close, widespread uncertainty still prevails regarding what synodality specifically means, let alone whether its implementation can assist meaningfully in evangelization. Hopefully, the upcoming final document will provide some measure of clarity.', 'Or, it could do just the opposite. Since the Synod on Synodality process was initiated, its central organizational apparatus has been dominated by clergy and lay advisers who appear inclined to open the door to changes in Catholic doctrine in areas like human sexuality and the ordination of women. ', 'If the final document does provide openings for changes in these areas, via the embrace of contentious proposals like the decentralization of doctrinal authority to regional bishops’ conferences, the integrity of Church teaching and potentially even the unity of the Church itself could be at risk. Nothing could be more injurious to its ability to carry out its evangelical witness.', 'The likeliest outcome, though, is that the result of the synodal process will remain in doubt. For one thing, whatever its final document might state, the Pope retains the final say about whether it has any magisterial authority going forward. For another, the most contentious issues in play at last year’s initial Synod on Synodality assembly were deliberately excluded from this meeting and shunted into the hands of 10 “study groups” that won’t report their findings until 2025. ', 'In light of this ambiguity, the presidential contest might turn out to be far more immediately impactful. Certainly there’s no shortage of major domestic and international issues in play that are of intense concern to Catholics, including abortion, religious liberty, immigration and the wars in the Holy Land, Ukraine and elsewhere. ', 'In each of these areas, highly significant differences are visible between the stances of Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. With respect to abortion, Vice President Harris has gone all in for legalizing abortion on demand nationally with no meaningful restraints, whereas former president Trump has expressed strong support for allowing individual states to continue to legislate their own abortion policies, as stipulated in the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. ', 'On religious liberty, Trump strongly supported pro-life conscience rights during his previous term as president and appears highly likely to do so again should he win a second term. Harris, by contrast, is inextricably associated with President Joe Biden’s record of seeking to suppress the conscience rights of Catholics and other medical professionals who oppose involvement with abortion procedures on the grounds of their faith, and she just doubled down this week stating there would be no “concessions” when asked specifically about religious exemptions.', 'On immigration, while Harris appears to remain closer to the U.S. bishops’ overall position than Trump, on the campaign trail she has shifted her rhetoric toward support for more restrictive policies in response to the widespread public anger over the lax border enforcement policies that were instituted at the start of the Biden administration. The candidates also differ on their approaches to the Holy Land and Ukraine conflicts, with Trump indicating stronger support for Israel and weaker support for Ukraine than Harris has expressed.', 'But just as with the outcome of the synod, Catholics need to remember that the verdict on this year’s Election Day doesn’t foretell what will eventually occur in these policy areas, or with the many other issues the next president inevitably will face during his or her term. As always with our messy democratic system of government, there will be numerous unexpected twists and turns along the way.', 'There’s a powerful lesson here for the faithful, wherever we might stand ecclesially or politically. When it comes to affairs of Church and state alike, our individual mission as followers of Jesus is not to become too attached to any predicted outcomes, nor too dismayed about any apparent setbacks. We should remember that nothing happens in this world that God has not foreseen and permitted.

The Pope recalled how the Chair represents love, unity, and mercy, and the call to service according to Jesus\' command to the Apostle Peter, while the Baldachin helps us rediscover the glory of the Holy Spirit, ""the true focal point of the entire basilica.""', ""In his homily Pope Francis recalled today's Gospel narrative of the blind man Bartimaeus who cries out to the Lord, asking to regain his sight. Rediscovering his sight, Bartimaeus joyfully sets out to follow Jesus along the way."", 'The Pope explained how Bartimaeus represents the ""inner blindness"" we all can have that can hold us back from ""the dynamism of life"" and having any hope. This can also affect us as Church, the Pope added, where we can become ""incapable of perceiving the presence of the Lord, unprepared to face the challenges of reality"" and at times unable to respond adequately ""to the questions of so many who cry out to us.""', '“We cannot remain inert before the questions raised by the women and men of today, before the challenges of our time, the urgency of evangelization and the many wounds that afflict humanity.”', 'The Pope warned that ""a sedentary Church"" that ""confines itself to the margins of reality"" risks remaining blind and will ""fail to grasp the urgency of giving a pastoral response to the many problems of our world.""', 'By remembering that ""the Lord is passing by"", the Church can be like Bartimaeus as a community of disciples who hear the Lord, go out to seek Him, and ""feel the joy of salvation...awakened by the power of the Gospel."" The Church in turn does this ""when it takes up the cry of all the women and men of the world"" who seek the joy of the Gospel, wish to rediscover faith, or are set back by suffering, poverty or marginalization.', '“We do not need a sedentary and defeatist Church, but a Church that hears the cry of the world and gets its hands dirty in serving.”', 'Just as Bartimaeus cried out to the Lord in faith and hope, may we do the same, the Pope said, as we also recognize God\'s action in our lives and  set out to follow him.

He noted that “at the end of the morning, the special secretary, Father Giacomo Costa, explained in detail the procedures of this new phase of work.”', 'In particular, Ruffini explained that the “modi” “are concrete proposals for modifications” to the text, whether by elimination, addition, or substitution.” Moreover, he said, the proposed amendments can be submitted either by individuals or by groups of Synod participants: Collective modi are those adopted in the language groups. Each proposed amended will be voted on separately by the full members of the Synod, with an absolute majority necessary for an amendment to be adopted.  ', 'The aim is to arrive at collective modifications that express the discernment of the group. Furthermore, Dr Ruffini continued, “the collective modi must be delivered by the end of tomorrow morning.', 'Each member can also send individual proposals to the General Secretariat of the Synod; however, the modi will naturally “carry more weight.”', 'Finally, Dr Ruffini pointed out “that the draft of the Final Document was written in Italian, as the official language, but was translated into as many languages as possible with unofficial translations. All this was done to facilitate the discernment of the various members.” He noted that Ukrainian and Chinese among the languages into which the text was translated, with the being “much appreciated” by the two Chinese bishops present at the Synod.', 'Dr Pires reported that 343 synod members were present in the hall, for the General Congregation on Tuesday, which was also attended by Pope Francis.', 'After the small group meetings following the presentation of the draft Final Document on Monday, “this morning [Tuesday] all the free speeches focused on the draft document. The text was appreciated for its balance, depth, density and, at the same time, proposals were made.”', '“There were 40 interventions on the various topics related to synodality addressed so far,” Pires noted, while specifying, “Among these was the topic of young people: with a request from one of the youngest members of the Synod who made an appeal to synod fathers and mothers in view of the post-Synod: ‘Please do not leave young people aside but walk with us; we want to walk with you.’’’', '“Other interventions,” Pires reported, “spoke of the role of women in the Church, reaffirming their fundamental importance; then the role of the laity, the Bishops’ Conferences, priests, consecrated life, and small Christian communities.”', 'The secretary of the Commission for Information concluded by pointing out that ongoing world news made its way into the Synod hall, with the invitation to the Church to reiterate “a strong and clear ‘No!’” to war: “We must continue to ask and implore an end to these conflicts,” was heard in the hall; “otherwise there will no longer be a human being alive who can read this Document.”', '“We were convened not to solve particular problems but to imagine a new way of being Church,” said Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, the first of the panelists to speak at Tuesday’s briefing. “The Synod did not deviate from the objective it had set itself, laying a foundation: starting from it, returning each one to his own house, as well as in the universal Church, we must apply this spirit of synodality to every problem that arises,” he said.', 'The Archbishop of Kinshasa expressed his satisfaction with the Synod as it draws to a close.', '“Our country is still considered a missionary land, our Church was until recently a missionary one, and it must adapt to the reality of the socio-cultural context,” he said, so “the convocation to the synod was seized as a kairós,” a moment of grace, and an opportunity to “see together how to imagine a new way of being Church.”', 'Now that synodality is emerging in the Church, Cardinal Ambongo assured journalists that in Africa, the Church, “together with our African brothers and sisters, will try tto enter into this new dynamic, how to be a Catholic Church differently.”', 'Archbishop Andrew Nkea Fuanya, of Bamenda, Cameroon, then took the floor, commenting on the African contribution to the Synod, starting with grassroots communities and catechists.', 'Synodality, he said, is “an eschatological sign for all of us,” who come from different parts of the world with different ideas.', 'He expressed the hope that synod participants would return to their home not only as people who have passively received synodality, but as active ambassadors,” for synodality, which, he continued, “I believe is really the future.”', 'In the context of Africa, where “the churches are full” the problem is “how to keep them” full, he stressed, adding, “We will do it through synodality.”', 'The Archbishop went on to highlight the fundamental role played by catechists, especially women, who comprise about half of the total number of catechists.', '“Africa is a special place for synodality,” so much so, he concluded, that “in small communities we manage to solve problems and have peace.”', 'Speaking of the post-secularisation situation in Germany, the Bishop of Essen, Franz-Josef Overbeck, emphasised the need for the Catholic Church to be re-inculturated.', '“After many years in which one was either Catholic or Protestant, now out of almost 84 million inhabitants, half are without faith, without religion and also without an idea of who God is,” he said, “while the other half is almost equally divided between Catholics and Protestants, with the presence of more than four million Muslims.” Although new small communities are working, there is a need to “evangelise anew” and at the same time “give a new answer on the role of women in the Church.”', 'In this state of post-secularisation, in which the Church lives “in tension between structure on the one hand and a new spirituality on the other,” synodality is “a path that we have already been living in for years,” the Bishop continued, adding that a synodal approach has already been developed after the abuse scandal in Germany.', 'Father Clarence Sandanaraj Davedassan, director of the Catholic Research Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, spoke about the experience of living synodality ad intra, within the Church; and ad extra, with others.', 'Apart from the Philippines and Timor Leste, he explained, Asia is a continent where Catholics are a minority.', 'While the faith is very much alive, he said, “this does not mean that secularisation and other problems are not present.”', 'If, he continued, “the public space for the expression of faith seems to be getting smaller and smaller” in many places, not least due to political and religious extremism, in such a context “one must seek harmony by engaging in dialogue.”', 'In such context, he insisted, dialogue “is not an option” but rather “a matter of survival. It is not a novelty but a necessity and is part of the experience we live daily within a pluralist culture.”', 'Synodality, he continued, is “at the foundation of all this” and is being lived everywhere, starting with the family, and it continues to bear fruit.', 'Thus, he said, the challenge in Asia involves learning to do theology “from the perspective of living with others” and learning to evangelise “where faith cannot be expressed in a public way.”', 'Finally, Fr Davedassan spoke about the phenomenon of migration, which has led many Asians to live in other parts of the world: “They are the new missionaries, because when they leave they are not just looking for an income but they take their faith with them.” he concluded, “And I know that in many places in the world they animate the Churches, contributing to keeping the faith alive.”', 'Thank you for reading our article.

', 'On the topic of the participation of women in the Church, the cardinal said the different ministries of women can be better “integrated” within Church structures so as to provide better “recognition, authority, formation, [and] recompense” for the work they carry out at the service of God and others.', 'In spite of the “enormous challenges of our times” — such as forced migration or conflict — Czerny said many of the Catholic faithful living on the margins or peripheries are witnesses of a “hopeful Church” and are therefore an example for others. ', '“Migrants are not only our deep concern in terms of solidarity and support and evangelization. But they’re also a sign of the mobility and the courage that the Church needs,” Czerny said. ', '“They’re not lacking in hope, they’re not lacking in resourcefulness, and they’re not lacking in missionary creativity. So I would say, as much as they win our concern and sympathy, they also win our admiration,” he added.', 'According to the prelate, the impact and legacy of synodality will go beyond the Catholic Church and reach out to the secular world. ', '“I think many of us are recognizing, experiencing that synodality would go a long way to helping make this world more peaceful, more human, more just, and finally more Christian,” he said.', '“That encourages us.

Called But Not Heard,https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/called-not-heard,"['Please email comments to letters@commonwealmagazine.org.', 'What version of Catholic womanhood would prevail at the close of the Synod on Synodality? This was the question that brought me to Rome this October for its final session, which may have long-term ripple effects on Church politics, Mass attendance, and practical pastoral matters, like whether or not people in underserved communities have access to the sacraments.', 'I traveled as a reporter with Discerning Deacons (DD), a group that advocates for the renewal of the diaconate and for allowing women to become deacons, as they were in many places during the Church’s first 900 years. DD organized the pilgrimage along with CEAMA (the Ecclesial Conference of the Amazon), which advocates for protection of the Amazon rainforest and Amazonian peoples, as well as for women deacons. In 2019, the Amazon Synod voted with a 70-percent majority in favor of ordaining women to the diaconate. ', 'The fifty-four DD and CEAMA pilgrims from five countries met in Rome during the first week of October. They had come from the United States, Australia, El Salvador, Canada, and Brazil. The youngest were in their twenties, the oldest in their eighties. Many of them are Indigenous; many immigrants to the United States from places like Mexico, India, and the Philippines. Some of them are sisters; some priests; some, to my surprise, lay men, like Darly Grigsby, an older black man with a tattoo of the Eucharist on his forearm. Grigsby converted to Catholicism, he told me, “because of a Catholic woman. She was the pastoral life director at my church and her pastoral skills, her presence, her charism, changed my life.” ', 'Most of these women have spent their entire lives doing ministry in the Church. Because they cannot be deacons or chaplains, we call them by many names: directors of liturgy and worship, pastoral assistants, catechists, spiritual directors, consociates, coordinators, theologians, directors of parish life. These titles often obscure more than they illuminate.', 'Some, though not all, feel called to be deacons, and many have already been asked by their bishops and priests to do diaconal work. Sr. Elizabeth Young, for example, performs baptisms and presides at funerals. Anne Attea does prison ministry. Ellie Hidalgo “give[s] reflections” at Mass. In short, these women do the work that deacons are called to do: the work of the Word, sacrament, and charity.', 'The role of the deacon was created in the early Church to make sure that the poor were not neglected in the daily distribution of food, to serve and recognize Jesus “in the distressing disguise of the poor,” as Mother Teresa put it. They also assisted priests by preaching and presiding over baptisms, weddings, and funerals. ', 'Deacons are of vital importance, especially to struggling parishes. My husband’s cousin, Fr. John, is a priest whose specialty is saving dying churches. The first thing he does is get to know faithful men in the community and ask them if they have considered becoming deacons. When parishes are restored to health, it’s often because of those new deacons. Priests are moved from parish to parish, but deacons stay and serve their communities for life.', 'Because women in Catholic ministry are not technically “ministers” they run into many problems and are prevented from helping the way they are called to. Anne Attea, who works with many undocumented people, told me, “Every now and then somebody is picked up by the police. An ordained minister can have access to prisoners, can visit them in prison—I was in prison and you visited me. But officially there are no women ministers in Catholicism.” Instead of a visit, she must make do with a video chat. ', ' ', 'The DD pilgrims arrived in Rome with great hope. Pope Francis has said that he wants “a listening church” that responds to the needs of the laity. They did not expect, of course, that women would be ordained by the close of the synod, but they did hope a path would begin to emerge. ', 'But by day two of their pilgrimage it was announced that the topic of women deacons was off the table and would no longer be discussed. Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez announced that “there is still no room for a positive decision by the magisterium regarding the access of women to the diaconate.” He noted that Pope Francis “does not consider the question mature.” The mere discussion of women deacons, though it is mentioned in Scripture (Rom 16:1-2) and in tradition (Council of Nicea 325 and Council of Chalcedon 451), was forbidden by a Church devoted to both. The topic would instead be taken up by a secretive study group, not the full assembly. ', 'Although I had heard many hateful stereotypes about these women, who have been derided as “wanting power” in order to “change the Church,” they did not despair. Rosella Kinoshameg, who serves the Odawa/Ojibway people on Manitoulin Island in Ontario and is in her eighties, said simply, “I trust in the Holy Spirit. When it’s meant to happen it will happen.”  ', 'Rosella and the other pilgrims were mocked by Australian Bishop Anthony Randazzo at a synod press conference. “A small minority with a powerful Western voice are obsessed with pressing this issue,” he said, “at the cost of the dignity of women in the Church and the world.” Bishop Randazzo, a white Westerner, was pretending to defend women of the Global South by suggesting that the issue of female deacons is a white Western women’s preoccupation distracting from real problems. ', 'But Rosella, like many of her fellow pilgrims, is not white, wealthy, or powerful. She is not an influencer and she has no social media. She is unconcerned with Western “culture wars.” She is a poor indigenous woman who serves other poor indigenous people because she has been asked to serve by her priest. She had come to Rome with Sr. Laura Vicuna, the head of CEAMA, a penniless woman herself, who is serving the poor indigenous people of her native Brazil as a Franciscan nun.', 'Casting doubt on women’s callings is a very old story in Catholicism. At the Papal Mass in St. Peter’s Square we looked up at the sculptures of women who had been persecuted in their own time but were now saints on the colonnade. St. Teresa of Avila, now a Doctor of the Church, was brought before the Inquisition and imprisoned for attempting to reform the Carmelite order. St. Thelca, who wanted to be a celibate preacher like St. Paul, not a wife and mother, survived multiple attempts at her life. We looked up at St. Olympia, who was herself a deacon.', 'The DD pilgrims I met were, to a person, extremely devout. They met for morning and evening prayer, in addition to daily Mass. They aren’t “cause people” as conservative Catholic George Weigel calls them. They’re women who love the Church, often at a great personal cost, and have spent their lives serving her. Women like Zully Tellez would text the group, “I’m praying a rosary in Spanish at 9 p.m. in the chapel if anyone would like to join me.” I knew their callings were sincere when I heard their testimonies, but they were further confirmed when I found that they were too busy doing good works to talk much about them.', 'Like St. Phoebe, they were believers who had come with an important message, only they had been forbidden to deliver it. That message was simple: there are women already doing the work of deacons; it makes sense to strengthen them with sacramental grace. While LGBTQ Catholics and others were able to speak to the synod participants directly about their experiences, these women were not. ', ' ', 'By now it is well known that the diaconate for women is not and has never been doctrinally precluded, and that women are mentioned as deacons in both Scripture and tradition. It is perhaps less well known, however, that the tradition of women deacons has been intentionally downplayed. The reading which mentions St. Phoebe was omitted from the lectionary in 1969, so Catholics never hear it at Mass. Phoebe’s saint day was never put on the Church’s calendar, effectively erasing her, until recently, from Catholic memory and devotion. ', 'The argument against women deacons is weak, so its opponents attack its supporters’ character and identity instead of their ideas. Men who are discerning are encouraged, celebrated, prayed for, and educated for free. Their discernment in and of itself—even if they are not called—is seen as worthwhile. Meanwhile, women who are called are stereotyped as angry, delusional, not really Catholic. These stereotypes are so pervasive that even I did not go to Rome expecting to meet women who had obvious vocations.', 'On October 4, the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi, DD and CEAMA held an educational event at Vatican’s Dicastery for the Faith in which many women spoke of their lives of diaconal service. I felt—and I felt everyone in the room knew—that we were in the presence of real holiness. It’s a humbling experience. These women were not activists, they were not celebrities, they were saints.', 'Sister Elizabeth Young, who works with the Aborignal peoples in Wilcanna, Australia, spoke of telling her parents she had a vocation at the age of seven. A soft-spoken redhead who draws no attention to herself, Sr. Elizabeth lives in one of the poorest communities on earth, where she hopes to be able to stay “as long as they will let me.” “I am blessed to be doing almost the same ministry as deacons,” she said. “My bishop...instituted me as a Catechist and Parish Life Coordinator to live as a guest in this beautiful town that, however, has been named as one of the most disadvantaged communities in the state.” Her bishop has also asked her to preside over funerals and baptisms. ', '[J]ust last week I had to conduct three funerals.... One of the deceased was a member of the stolen generation and the godfather at the first baptism I performed there. As we share the power of ritual and enter into vulnerable spaces, we look to the cultural traditions and spiritual resources that have meaning and the power of healing. More and more I feel it is God’s mercy, both given and received. Yet healing is needed at all levels, including the Church. My ministry is a privilege, yet I don’t see many pathways for other women after me.', 'Sr. Elizabeth would not even name her bishop for fear he would face reprisals for allowing her to serve in this way.', 'Sr. Laura Vicuna Pereira Manso, a Franciscan sister who lives in an Indigenous community in Portho Velho, Brazil, spoke of watching her Indigenous brothers and sisters be murdered while trying to protect the Amazon rainforest, their ancestral home. As she spoke Cardinal Barreto of Peru, also a member of CEAMA, nodded his head and pointed to her as if to say, listen to her. It is a struggle to imagine an American Cardinal sitting next to a woman called to ordained ministry and simply listening and nodding his head. ', 'Rosella Kinoshameg, who was sent to a residential school at the age of eight, now has ecclesial recognition as a leader in her Indigenous Catholic community. She presides over communion services, leads prayers at funerals and wakes, ministers to the sick and dying, and chairs the board of the Indigenous Reconciliation Fund. She spoke of Kamloops in British Columbia, where unmarked graves of First Nations children were recently found at the site of a residential school. “When we heard the news,” Rosella said pausing to collect herself, “people were very upset and angry, many people left the church.... I meet people where they are in this anger and pain.... I do this as a representative of the Church because I am part of the Diocesan Order of Service.” ', 'As a girl she was taught by her teachers that Indigenous ways were “evil,” but she says, “My father showed me how our Catholic faith and native teachings could come together.” She now leads smudging (purification) ceremonies before Mass at her parish because she was asked to do so by her priest. They are a way of keeping traditions alive and atoning for past sins committed against native people. She spoke of her calling to “carry out the ministries of acolyte and lector, and to assist in other ministries necessary to the life of the church community” and to advance her parish’s mission “to raise up Indigenous leaders in a fully alive Indigenous Catholic Church.” ', 'Despite the setback, all those who spoke had faith that a female diaconate would eventually become a reality. Casey Stanton, the co-director of DD put it this way, “Today we watched workers who are re-laying a cobblestone street on the edge of the Vatican. One little square at a time. They are old stones. There’s a giant pile of them. It looks like it will never be finished—but actually the road is being rebuilt. This ancient path will be restored, in time, the signs would have us believe, for the jubilee.”', 'On Sunday, October 7, the last day of the pilgrimage, all of the cardinals and synod delegates were invited to a private rosary with Pope Francis. Thousands of ordinary people came to the plaza outside the church, rosaries in hand, to attend the just recently announced event.', 'The pilgrims stood outside and prayed with other synod participants, carrying images of St. Phoebe. Rosella, elderly and unable to stand for long periods of time, sat on the ground. A giant screen was erected in front of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, a building consecrated and dedicated to Mary by Pope Sixtus III in 432 but not completed until 1743. At first, the screen displayed ads for Italian luxury brands like Versace. The images of glamorous fashion models stood in stark contrast to the habited nuns and sandaled Franciscans. Eventually the rosary service came on the screen and the pilgrims prayed along in dozens of languages. It sounded chaotic until everyone landed in unison on the “Ave Marias” and the “amens.”', 'As clerics and delegates left St. Mary Major, the pilgrims, along with the rest of the participants, approached them asking for prayers. One asked for “prayers for Syria where I serve, and for an end to the war”; another asked for prayers for his family: “I am a deacon and I have a wife and two children at home in Belgium.”', 'It reminded me of a scene at the beginning of the film, “A Man for All Seasons”: Thomas More, leaving a meeting with Cardinal Wosley, is pressed by commoners waiting with petitions written on tiny scraps of paper. Like More, the princes of the Church stopped after the service and indulged those beseeching them. DD and CEAMA members asked them to pray for the Church’s discernment of the role of women in ministry. They pressed prayer cards with an icon of St. Phoebe into the clerics’ hands. “We are here,” they seemed to be saying. “We are serving. We too are the Church.”', ' ', 'The idea of synodality, which Pope Francis clearly hopes will outlive his pontificate, is to make the Church into both a teaching church and a listening church. To reflect this, the tables at the synod were circular, and everyone was encouraged to speak freely. This sounds small, but it’s radical in a quiet way. ', 'Despite the doors closing to women deacons, there’s evidence of the Church listening to those hoping to expand women’s role. Synod membership was opened up to four hundred delegates, with women serving as voting members for the first time. One of those fifty-four women, Sr. Maria de los Delores Palecia of Mexico, a fierce defender of migrants and other vulnerable people, served as the President Delegate to the Synod Assembly. Asked at one press conference what it was like to be carrying out a role previously reserved for men, she responded in a measured but optimistic way: “I think we are truly on a journey with the role of women, their gifts and contributions are increasingly recognized.” Women like her were referred to as “Synod Mothers,” and included many theologians. They were accepted by so-called conservative and liberal Catholics alike.', 'Before the Second Vatican Council there were no female professors of theology. Today, who, even on the right, would want to go back to a time when women were not permitted to study and teach theology? Women are in the highest levels of administration and management in the Church, to an extent that would have been unthinkable sixty years ago. One DD pilgrim, Dr. Lydia Tinajero Deck, told me, “The nuns are already running things, they are not meek and mild.” The changes are slow, sometimes achingly so, but they are real.', 'And there is widespread support for women to be accepted into ministry. One delegate from the United States speaking on background said, “The synod said yes. The Pope said no.” Even at synod press conferences, the “no” was not a “never,” but rather, as Fr. Giacoma Costa S.J. said, a “not yet.” “It’s not exactly clear how to develop this diaconate,” he explained. “We are looking for an ecclesial path.” ', 'But for now, the contradictions remain unresolved. Women cannot image God and yet they are made in God’s image. Women are revered and yet derivative and inferior. Women are equal and yet they remain marked with the sin of Eve—dangerous, troublemaking beings, made of breasts and blood and temptation, whose hands cannot bless. The Catechism says that God is neither male nor female, and yet it is very important that “He” is a he. The Church says that women can be saints and that they can lead. They are given the same baptismal grace. But it lacks credibility, especially with the next generation, when it says at the same time, even in light of the priest shortage, that it is better for someone to be deprived of the sacraments than to receive them from a girl. ', 'The fear among Catholics who oppose women deacons is real. For them the Church is like a very old sweater, you pull one thread and the whole thing may unravel. But there is fear on the other side as well. Without more deacons, both male and female, many people will not encounter a minister in their time of need. They will not be served, and they will feel abandoned. Here is a danger of genuine unraveling. The Church will look weak, unwilling to admit when it has fallen short. The American Catholic Church in particular may increasingly become a club for people with revanchist views on gender and sexuality, instead of a Church whose doors are open to anyone who wishes to bow their heads before Jesus in the Eucharist and pray.', 'Luckily, the heirs of St. Phoebe are not going anywhere. Their pleas to be used not simply as office managers but as ministers will continue to be pressed into the hands of bishops and cardinals and popes, until someone says yes, it is right and just that this ancient path be restored.

LETTERS FROM THE SYNOD – 2024: #11,https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2024/10/letters-from-the-synod-2024-11,"['As Synod-2024 limps toward the finish line, with everyone experiencing Synod Exhaustion Syndrome—the exceptions being the indefatigable activists who came here to transform this month into the “Vatican III” of progressive Catholicism’s dreams, and their media allies—conversations are turning to the questions that surfaced during the Synod’s discussions: questions whose resolution in the next years and decades will shape the Catholicism of the twenty-first century, especially among the struggling local churches of the West, some of which are on life-support.', 'Synod-2024 has made at least one thing abundantly clear: Africa has set its course into the future, guided by dynamic orthodoxy and committed to the New Evangelization in full; its bishops have defended that course this month with intelligence, vigor, and courage. But what about the Catholicism of the “Old World” and its formerly colonial outposts in North America and Oceania? What about Latin America, which seems to have forgotten the Aparecida Document and its robust call to the New Evangelization? Judging by what their representatives have said at Synod-2024, Peru, Brazil, and other local churches between the Rio Grande and Tierra del Fuego are reverting to the incoherence that marked the decade following CELAM’s 1968 Medellin Conference, which marked the heyday of the various theologies of liberation. And then there is the vastness of Asia and Oceania, where some local churches seem to be advancing with confidence, guided by the teaching of Vatican II as authoritatively interpreted by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, while others are marching backward to the 1970s in the name of a “progress” that seems ephemeral when measured by indices of Catholic practice.', 'This has been, in many respects, a Synod dominated by the concerns found primarily in the West, which has meant that moribund or dying local churches have been setting the agenda of discussion. Nonetheless, globalization means that the cultural and theological drivers behind those Western agendas will inevitably touch the local churches in the rest of the world. So the two issues explored here are of global significance, even as those issues express themselves in different keys throughout the world Church. XR II', 'by George Weigel', 'Richard Rex is Professor of Reformation history in the faculty of Divinity and Polkinghorne Fellow in Theology and Religious Studies at Cambridge University’s Queens’ College. In a brilliant review article published in 2018, Prof. Rex argued that Catholicism today is in the throes of the third great crisis of its bimillennial history. Had Richard Rex given the opening address to the Synods of 2023 and 2024—had his analysis of the signs of these times as laid out in that article framed the Instrumentum Laboris for each Synod—the past two Synods might have been spent in serious conversation about the twenty-first-century cultural environment and its implications for the Church’s contemporary mission, rather than in the quicksand pits of ecclesiastical self-referentiality.', 'So what did the Synod miss by missing Prof. Rex? What were those first two great crises—and what is the third, through which we are living?  ', 'Three Crises', 'The first crisis was the lengthy, often fierce, Church-dividing debate over “What is God?” ', 'It was triggered in the early fourth century by the Alexandrian theologian Arius, who taught that what Christianity knew as the “Son” was a sort of demiurge, through whom the world was created but who was not co-eternal with the Father; in Arius’s formulation, there was a time when “the Son was not.” The debate over “What is God?” was then extended and amplified and by the heresy of Monophysitism, according to which Jesus’s humanity was not-quite-real, but rather a kind of Superman costume masking his divinity.  The question “What is God?” was definitively answered by the First Council of Nicaea I (A.D. 325), which condemned Arius and gave us the Creed we recite today, and the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451), which, influenced by Pope Leo the Great and his famous “Tome,” took the hammer to Monophysitism. Nicaea I affirmed that Jesus is truly God, the second person of the eternal Trinity; Chalcedon affirmed that, through the Incarnation of the second person of the Trinity, divinity and humanity are united in the one person of Jesus Christ. Nicaea I and Chalcedon thus secured the trinitarian and incarnational foundations of Christian orthodoxy for all time.', 'The second crisis, which led to the fracture of Western Christendom in the various sixteenth-century Protestant Reformations, revolved around the question, “What is the Church?” Did the Church have a definitive form or constitution given it by Christ, a form that included the seven-part sacramental system? Over the three periods of its work (1545–47, 1551–52, and 1562–63), the Council of Trent gave the orthodox response to that question: Yes. Trent’s ecclesiology was then refined over the succeeding centuries by Pope Pius XII’s renewal of the Church’s self-understanding in the 1943 encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi (The Mystical Body of Christ); by the Christocentricity of Lumen Gentium (Light of the Nations), the Second Vatican Council’s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church; by the 1985 Extraordinary Synod of Bishops, which synthesized Vatican II’s teaching by describing the Church as a communion of disciples in mission; and by John Paul II in the 1990 encyclical Redemptoris Missio (The Mission of the Redeemer), which vigorously defended the permanence of the Church’s missionary mandate in every time and place, while calling every Catholic to live out the meaning of baptism in a life of missionary discipleship. ', 'And the third crisis, through which we’re living? That, Prof. Rex argued, involves “a question that would once have been expressed as ‘What is man?’ The fact that this wording is now itself seen as problematic is a symptom of the very condition it seeks to diagnose. What is it, in other words, to be human?” That, Rex rightly contends, is what’s at issue in “an entire alphabet of beliefs and practices: abortion, bisexuality, contraception, divorce, euthanasia, family, gender, homosexuality, infertility treatment,” and so forth and so on, across the cratered, Verdun-like landscape of a culture war that, beginning outside the Church, is now being fought within the household of faith. And the stakes could not be higher. For as Rex wrote six years ago, “If Catholicism were to reconcile itself to the new moral order of Western society, then it would be abandoning its past, its tradition, and thus its identity. It would give up its claim to truth and, therefore, its claim upon our faith.” ', 'So, first, a “theological” crisis, in the literal meaning of theology: “speaking about God.” Then an ecclesiological crisis. And now an anthropological crisis. The previous two crises were Church-dividing. The third could well be, as the divisions displayed at the Synods of 2023 and 2024 (and in fact in the Synods of 2014, 2015, 2018, and the 2019 Amazonian Synod) ought to have demonstrated, given the abandonment of Catholicism’s biblically-grounded understanding of the human person by prominent bishops, theologians, and activists on those occasions.', 'The Third Crisis Illustrated', 'The question “Who are we as human beings?” is most sharply posed by the evolution of the LGBTQ+ agenda to include the transgender insurgency. This plague, a farrago of bad science married to barmy ideology, has now infected education throughout the Western world. A particularly striking example of it was reported by Mary Wakefield in the London-based Spectator last year: “a drag queen on the Isle of Man had informed Year 7 pupils that there are exactly 73 genders. When one brave child insisted that there were only two, the drag queen allegedly responded ‘You’ve upset me’ and sent the child out.” ', 'There is something even worse than this abandonment of any pretense to educational seriousness, however, and that is the abandonment of any pretense to medical professionalism and medical ethics by American doctors who, influenced more by gender ideology than by “the science,” and affirmed in their irresponsibility by the American Academy of Pediatrics, prescribe puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones to children suffering from the serious mental health problem of gender dysphoria. This therapeutic cave-in to wokery in the U.S. was challenged in 2023 by the editors of the venerable British newsmagazine the Economist (firmly center-left in its politics), whose editors noted that “the medical systems of Britain, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden” have “all . . . raised the alarm, describing [these] treatments as ‘experimental’ and urging doctors to proceed with ‘great medical caution.’” That alarm bell was rung even more loudly this year by the Cass Report commissioned by England’s National Health Service, in which the former president of the Royal Society of Pediatrics and Child Health urged “extreme caution” in the use of hormone therapies for youth and young adults. ', 'Physicians who follow the science and not the ideology are not the only ones sounding the alarm over the harm being done by this latest perverse twist of the sexual revolution. Thus Cole Aronson, an Orthodox Jew and keen student of philosophy, published a devastating ethical critique of “sex-reassignment” surgeries on the website Public Discourse last year. Aronson concluded by observing that it’s not only those on the political left who must reconsider gender ideology and transgenderism: “Conservatives need to choose between their impulse to let people live as they damn well please and their opposition to the grisly stuff being done by scientists and surgeons.”', 'Why is the Church’s voice often muted, or confusing, in this contest for the human future? I suggest that it’s because Prof. Rex is right and that the Church, primarily but not exclusively in the Western world, is ensnared in a crisis over “us”: a crisis over the nature and destiny of the human. The gospel demands pastoral charity toward those suffering from gender dysphoria and experiencing same-sex attraction. That charity, however, must include truth-telling about who we are, which we learn from divine revelation and human reason. And what we learn from those sources is that gender ideology and the transgenderism for which it advocates is as false a god, and as destructive of body and soul, as Baal and Moloch. ', 'But was this said at Synod-2023 or Synod-2024? No. Rather, in the off-Broadway part of the “synodal process,” Pope Francis spent over an hour with a delegation of LGBTQ+ activists, including transgender people and a surgeon who performs “sex-reassignment” procedures. One of those present later alleged to the press that the pope had indicated that sensitivity toward transgender people would be among his criteria for choosing bishops. Whether Pope Francis said that or not, this unprecedented meeting hardly advanced the Catholic conversation about the third great crisis in the Church’s history. ', 'Bubbles and Missed Opportunities', '', 'As noted before in these LETTERS, the debates of this past month have often seemed to be taking place inside a vast ecclesiastical bubble. That palpable sense of detachment from the many grave problems of the contemporary world, and especially from what could be termed the “human nature crisis,” might have been obviated, or at least mitigated, if the Synod managers had thought to invite Prof. Rex and others with a keen insight into the cultural and ecclesiastical signs of the times to help frame the Synod’s work. Wouldn’t a triennial “synodal process” built around Richard Rex’s argument that we are living through the third great crisis in the bimillennial history of the Church have been more fruitful—more “relevant,” to use that favorite progressive Catholic term—than the circularity and self-referentiality of a “Synod on Synodality”? Might such an exercise in reading the signs of the times in light of the gospel have gotten the world’s attention (and the Church’s) in a way that this process manifestly has not?', '', 'It was not to be, however. That was a great lost opportunity. It was a lost opportunity to strengthen Catholicism amidst the third great crisis of its history. But it was worse than that. Because the Church’s lost opportunity was also a lost opportunity for a world that badly needs to hear a gospel-informed, compassionate word of sanity in response to the question, “Who are we?”', 'George Weigel is a Distinguished Senior Fellow of Washington’s Ethics and Public Policy Center.  ', 'by Stephen White', 'Several of the problems inherent in a proportionalist approach to moral theology have been previously discussed in these LETTERS. Not the least of these problems is that proportionalism denies that any acts violate the moral order by their very nature. This objection—and the fact that proportionalism flatly contradicts Veritatis Splendor—ought to be sufficient reason to avoid proportionalism.', 'The problems with proportionalism go beyond its refusal to recognize the category of intrinsically evil acts, however. By severing moral action from the objective character of concrete moral acts, we are left with a theory of moral action that is not only incapable of identifying things we must never do, but that reduces the moral life from a God-given path to true freedom to a means for assessing, assigning, and, when possible, mitigating guilt. ', 'To understand what is meant by this, consider the questions Pope John Paul II poses at the outset of Veritatis Splendor: “[D]o the commandments of God, which are written on the human heart and are part of the Covenant, really have the capacity to clarify the daily decisions of individuals and entire societies? Is it possible to obey God and thus love God and neighbor, without respecting these commandments in all circumstances?”', 'Obedience to the divine moral law is not, in the first instance, a matter of avoiding guilt. The moral law is given to us as a path by which to grow closer to God, indeed, to grow more like God. This connection between moral choice and our own being and becoming is not merely a subjective or psychological connection, still less a means for determining our own guilt or innocence.', 'Some actions can be bad or evil without imputing guilt to the one who commits the act, such as in the case of invincible ignorance. But such actions, even when guiltless, still have other consequences. For one, our actions habituate us. Good moral habits (virtues) make us more free: that is, more readily able to choose the good. Bad moral habits (vices) make that more difficult, chaining us to sin, clouding our conscience, and making it more difficult for us to love God and neighbor as we ought.', 'A vicious man might be so wedded to his sin that his culpability for that sin is close to nil. But would anyone seriously argue that his comparative lack of culpability is a good thing? Is he better for this? Is anyone else better for this?', 'Let’s go back to those questions posed by John Paul II. Is the moral law given to us to help us become more like what we were made to be (to grow in perfection, as we used to say), or was it given to us as a subjective measure of our guilt or innocence? ', 'Proportionalism strains this connection between the order of creation and the moral order—between what we are and what we are meant to be—to the breaking point. In so doing, it weakens the connection between moral reasoning and, as John Paul II put it, “the conditions for the moral growth of man, who has been called to perfection.” This growth begins with obedience to the moral law—written in the hearts of men, codified in the Decalogue, and fulfilled in the person of Christ—and finds its fullest expression in the perfections of the Beatitudes.', 'Proportionalism promised a humane alternative to the legalistic moral theology of the manualists, which (fairly or not) earned the reputation for reducing moral reason to mere rule-following, minimizing the proper role of conscience through a sort of Pharisaical algorithm with defined outputs for every conceivable input. ', 'But by untethering the conscience from the objective character of moral acts, proportionalism fails to free the conscience so that it might choose the good. Instead, it “frees” the conscience from the “burden” of law, which is to say from the “burden” of having to conform moral action according to objective reality.', 'In doing so, proportionalism leads the conscience to a position in which the moral law is either rejected outright (a jarringly unappealing option for most), or in which the work of conscience is to be constantly searching for workarounds and exceptions to the “constraints” of the moral law. Rather than embracing the moral law as a gift, meant for our own growth and holiness and as an aid on our path to salvation, proportionalism supplants this positive aim of moral action with a fundamentally negative aim: It becomes a way to avoid the imputation of guilt through discovering an ever-expanding matrix of mitigating subjective circumstances.', 'In this way, proportionalism would replace the strict legalism of the manualists with a lax legalism of its own.', 'Rather than seeking human freedom in conformity to God’s own ordering of reality, many Catholics behave as though freedom exists in the “spaces between” the moral teachings of the Church. As I’ve argued elsewhere, this is a childish, legalistic view of morality which asks, “What’s the most I can get away with?” For this sort of lax legalism, “mercy” means little more than lowering the threshold by which the minimum requirements of the law might be satisfied.', 'This also explains the tendency among some Catholics—perhaps including some among the Synod participants—to treat discernment as a sort of dialectic. Listening to the Holy Spirit begins with a presumption of change; Church teachings are submitted to a pattern of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis; and the desired result is a progressive expansion of justifiable moral outcomes. Discernment can lead to gradual changes, or it can lead to rapid changes, but the one thing discernment must never do is allow the Church to remain what she has always been. For Catholics who see discernment (synodal or otherwise) in this instrumentalized way, the Holy Spirit is never supposed to say, “No.”', 'Meanwhile, St. Paul’s exhortation remains: “Stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught” (2 Thess. 2:15).

Interrupting the action of the Spirit this way can take many forms. In our daily lives, we do it when we do not really listen to other people's experiences. The cardinals can obstruct or frustrate the Spirit even when they choose a pope. And, of course, a synod where no one speaks very frankly also might be a way of frustrating the Spirit."", ""In every case, we are the ones who bar the Spirit from the room.

He did not respond directly to a request to define what would determine ""ripeness"" for a greater role for women.', ""The multi-year synod process had sparked great hopes for change, especially for women, who have long complained that they are treated as second-class citizens in the church. Women are barred from the church's highest ministerial positions, yet do the lion's share of the work running Catholic hospitals and schools and passing the faith onto future generations."", 'Speaking to the synod on Thursday, Fernandez explained that a special working group would continue beyond the closing of the meeting, but that its focus would be on discussing the role of women in the church — not in the diaconate, or the office of deacon. He added that while working with women in previous pastoral roles, ""most did not ask for or want the diaconate, which would be cumbersome for their lay work.""', 'The meeting asked for ""full implementation of all the opportunities already provided for in Canon Law with regard to the role of women, particularly in those places where they remain under-explored.""

According to reforms he made in 2018, the Synod on Synodality’s final text is therefore part of his ordinary magisterium.', 'This decision is a break from previous practice, which usually sees the pope use a synod’s final document as a basis for drafting his own apostolic exhortation on the topic (think Amoris Laetitia after the 2015 Synod on the Family). The fact that a synod body whose membership was 27% non-bishops just produced a magisterial text will certainly leave theologians and canonists with much to talk about.', 'The document says that the Synod on Synodality was the product of “putting into practice what the council taught about the Church as mystery and the Church as people of God.”', 'Therefore, the document says, the synodal process “constitutes an authentic further act of the reception” of Vatican II, “thus reinvigorating its prophetic force for today’s world.”', 'The final text says that women “continue to encounter obstacles” in living out their “charisms, vocation, and roles” in the Church.', 'The synod calls for women to be accepted into any role currently allowed by canon law, including leadership roles in the Church.', 'Regarding the question of “women’s access to diaconal ministry,” the text says the question “remains open” and that “discernment needs to continue.” A separate Vatican study group is currently considering that topic, with its final report expected in June 2025.', 'The document calls for episcopal conferences to play a greater role in enculturating the faith in their local context and asks for clarification about their current level of doctrinal authority. However, it does emphasize that bishops’ conferences cannot override a local bishop’s authority nor “risk either the unity or the catholicity of the Church.”', 'The document also calls for more plenary and provincial councils, and for the Vatican to accept these bodies’ conclusions more speedily.', 'While it does condemn the exclusion of others because of “their marital situation, identity, or sexuality,” the text doesn’t use the term “LGBTQ.”', 'The final document calls for a “synodal” reform of canon law, including removing the formula that consultative bodies have “merely a consultative” vote. It calls for the greater participation of lay people in “decision-making processes” and to do so through new synodal structures and institutions.', 'Church authorities, the document states, may not ignore conclusions reached by consultative, participatory bodies.', 'The document describes the “sensus fidei” as the “instinct for truth of the Gospel” received through baptism. It also notes that the people of God cannot err “when they show universal agreement in matters of faith and morals.”', 'Interestingly, the final document does not include additional language about the need for “authentic discipleship” to maturely exercise the sensus fidei, which was included in last year’s synthesis document and is found in an important Vatican document on the subject.', 'Depending on how it’s implemented, the synod’s final document could concretely impact everything from how bishops are selected to how governance decisions are made in parishes, dioceses, and the Vatican, with a greater emphasis on widespread consultation. It could also create new synodal bodies, like continental assemblies and a council of Eastern Catholic leaders to advise the pope.', 'Over 27% of delegates voted against continuing to explore the possibility of women deacons.', 'Thirteen percent voted against the paragraph emphasizing the significance of episcopal conferences, which also appears to bind a bishop to decisions made by his conference.', 'Twelve percent voted against establishing a study group to look into making liturgical celebrations “more an expression of synodality,” including what may be a reference to lay preaching during the liturgy.', 'And 11% of delegates opposed the proposal to revise canon law “from a synodal perspective.”', 'The final document describes synodality as “a path of spiritual renewal and structural reform that enables the Church to be more participatory and missionary, so that it can walk with every man and woman, radiating the light of Christ.”', 'The model of synodality, the document states, is Mary because she “listens, prays, meditates, dialogues, accompanies, discerns, decides, and acts.”', 'If you value the news and views Catholic World Report provides, please consider donating to support our efforts.

The Reformation comes immediately to mind; the “instinct for truth of the Gospel” did not deter Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, or Knox (and certainly not Henry VIII).\nIt seems this final document of the Synod and accepted by the pope is so demonstrably faulty, that it boggles the mind.

If they can, it is only possible via making Christ a relative value and “walking together with all humanity” the absolute value.

Raymond J. de Souza', 'SATURDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2024', 'The flagship of the fleet, the Holy See Ship Synodality, is in dire straits (leaks about the final document that will be issued today suggest it will be, for those with radical hopes, a disappointment). HSS Synodality took a serious hit last December with the fiasco of Fiducia supplicans regarding the blessing of same-sex couples, and began listing seriously to starboard.', 'The current synodal assembly on synodality in Rome has now delivered another shot on the port side; another fiasco has unfolded regarding women deacons. And the man responsible for both hits is Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, one of the most senior admirals in service on the barque of Peter.', 'HSS Synodality set sail when Pope Francis announced in March 2020 the commissioning of a great new ship. The synodal process on synodality for a synodal Church will thus mark its fifth anniversary early next year. It has sailed through some rough waters, but even after five years, it is not clear where exactly synodality is headed. HSS Synodality has thus been on a voyage without a destination.', 'Perhaps the purpose is the voyage, not the destination – the motto of travel agents and military recruiters for generations. It’s not about where the ship is headed but how it gets there. That’s why Cardinal Fernández has proved so deadly to synodality. In his navy, the admirals do not consult the petty officers – or even the commanders.', 'Opening this assembly of the synodal process, Pope Francis preached earlier this month that, “every word is to be received with gratitude and simplicity and can become an echo of what God has given for the good of our brothers and sisters.”', '“The more we realize that we are surrounded by friends who love, respect and appreciate us, friends who want to listen to what we have to say, the more we will feel free to express ourselves spontaneously and openly,” the Holy Father said.', 'Openness, consultation, transparency, respect, listening – these are the hallmarks of synodality. All voices are to be heard. All are friends to be cherished.', 'Thus it was a mortal blow when, last December, having said nothing to anyone, Cardinal Fernández launched the Fiducia supplicans torpedo, authorizing blessings for same-sex couples. The reaction from the “starboard” side of the Church was fierce and was led by the African bishops. Fernández was forced to back down, in essence rescinding his own orders.', 'Some on the “port” side had welcomed the new orders – Captain James Martin, SJ, had implemented them immediately – though no one could defend them as being synodal in any sense. The synodal assembly of October 2023 had carefully decided not to mention the issue. Meanwhile, Cardinal Fernández was at work on authorizing same-sex blessings and kept it all clandestine. Synodality was exposed as a pretense.', 'HSS Synodality bravely sailed on though, limping and listing, a mutiny brewing. Pope Francis, knowing that the synodality could not suffer another such blow, decided in the months after Fiducia supplicans to set up “study groups” on ten themes, thereby removing all substantive issues from the synodal process. There would be no more damaging debates about where HSS Synodality was headed. There would only be reflections on enjoying the trip.', 'The study groups would not report until June 2025 – extending the synodal process past its fifth anniversary – but would provide an interim report in October 2024.', 'In July, the membership of the 15 study groups on the ten themes was announced. Group 5, however, charged with “the question of the necessary participation of women in the life and leadership of the Church” did not divulge its membership. It was only reported that it had “been entrusted to the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.” Admiral Fernández would be at the helm.', 'Fernández dutifully gave his interim report earlier this month to the assembly. He confirmed that women deacons – meaning in Holy Orders – were not possible, something the Holy Father himself had stated flatly in the extra-synodal forum of 60 Minutes, to which he had granted an interview last April. Fernández did not shed light on how the discussion had unfolded or who had been consulted; he did not even reveal who was part of Study Group 5. It was all very secretive and not at all synodal – even though the Holy Father had charged the study groups with proceeding in a “synodal” manner.', 'The incoming fire on the port side was immediate and fierce. Captain Martin and others who were willing to cast synodality overboard when it suited their same-sex advocacy were not pleased about being cut out of the process when it came to women deacons.', 'The synod managers had a problem on their hands. The Fiducia supplicans fiasco had alienated many of those who were not keen on synodality to begin with. But on women deacons, the substitution of secrecy for synodality enraged those who were the most keen to board the HSS Synodality. This mutiny would be more serious.', 'An addition to synod schedule was hastily announced. Last Friday, there would be an opportunity to meet the study groups and have a bit of remedial synodal consultation.', 'It did not go well. Over a hundred – more than a quarter – of the synod delegates opted to attend the discussion with Study Group 5. Except that no members of Study Group 5 showed up, and their identities remained secret. Fernández dispatched two junior seamen from the doctrinal office to hand out an email address to which comments could be sent.', 'The port side was not amused. Indeed, “palpable outrage” was the theme, acknowledged even by Austen Ivereigh, an otherwise reliable booster of the synodal process. Within hours, Fernández tried to contain the damage by releasing a message apologizing for the “misunderstanding” and offering another meeting at which he would personally be present.', 'On Monday morning, Fernández addressed the issue again at the assembly itself, attempting to contain the fire below decks. He explained that Pope Francis had already shut the door on women deacons on 60 Minutes and elsewhere, that women in the diaconate did not address the actual situation of the vast majority of Catholic women, and that the Holy Father’s opening of the ministry of catechist to women had been something of a flop. Nevertheless, if delegates wished to meet with him about Study Group 5, he would be happy to do so on Thursday, 24th October. In addition to an email address, other ways of sending material would be provided.', 'Alas, the seriousness of that offer was immediately undermined when it announced the same morning that the fourth encyclical of Pope Francis – Dilexit nos, on the Sacred Heart – would be released the same day. Thus on Thursday, the encyclical was released and a press conference will be held to present it. There will also be a press conference about the synodal assembly. To that full agenda will be added the meeting about Study Group 5, an afterthought tacked on to a day when attention will be focused elsewhere.', 'Thus on two major issues, Cardinal Fernández has (fatally?) undermined synodality, revealing that at the highest levels of the Church, on issues of significant importance, secret processes without any consultation are the preferred method of proceeding. Synodality is the window dressing while the real maneuvers take place behind closed doors.', 'Whether viewed from starboard or port, the HSS Synodality is sinking.

That is why I am making it immediately available to everyone.”', 'JOHN LONGHURST / FREE PRESS', ""Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square after the final night of the Synod on Synodality."", 'The synod’s work is not finished, he said.', '“There are and there will be decisions to be made,” the Pope said.', 'This includes the work of the 10 study groups, including groups on the role of women in the church and LGBTTQ+ Catholics, that are to report to him next year. Those groups “must work with freedom to offer me proposals,” the Pope said, adding this was not a way of “postponing decisions indefinitely.”', 'Pope Francis’ remarks came at the end of the Synod on Synodality, a three-year process aimed to help the Church involve all Catholics in working together to address challenges facing them around the world.', 'It included tens of thousands of listening sessions at the parish and diocesan levels on every continent, along with two month-long gatherings of bishops and lay people — including women — in Rome. The second, and final, one ended Saturday.', 'The synod finished by releasing a 51-page document that, among other things, recommends changes to the ways future priests are trained, promotes greater lay involvement in selecting bishops, and mandates greater transparency and accountability throughout the church.', 'It also recommends the “increased participation of laymen and laywomen in Church discernment processes and all phases of decision-making processes,” including through things such as diocesan synods that can ensure “regular consultation between the bishop and his people.”', 'One thing the document does not recommend is for women to become ordained deacons, a subject of much controversy at the synod. At the same time, it does not close the door to the possibility, stating, “The question of women’s access to diaconal ministry remains open” and that “discernment needs to continue.”', 'The document acknowledged that while men and women are equal in the eyes of God, “Women continue to encounter obstacles” in the Church. It calls for the Church to implement all opportunities for involvement already available for women, adding, “There is no reason or impediment that should prevent women from carrying out leadership roles.”', 'The document does not mention a fuller welcome and affirmation of members of the LGBTTQ+ community. It does state that some Catholics “unfortunately” continue to experience “the pain of feeling excluded or judged because of their marital situation, identity or sexuality.” This exclusion prevents them from pursuing “real and meaningful relationships” in the Church, something that hampers the Church’s witness.', 'One topic that garnered much attention at the synod was what freedom local dioceses might have when it comes to enacting policies or practices that are appropriate for their local contexts or culture — things that are unique to them but not to Catholics in other places. For example, can German Catholics be more affirming of LGBTTQ+ since that is normative in that country, while some African Catholics can be more accepting of polygamous relationships that are more common on that continent? The document says more study is needed to decide those questions.', 'WINNIPEG JETS GAME DAYS', 'On Winnipeg Jets game days, hockey writers Mike McIntyre and Ken Wiebe send news, notes and quotes from the morning skate, as well as injury updates and lineup decisions.

This would include adopting more “celebratory styles” of worship, along with exploring the role of preaching.', 'The document also calls for more training for those working with minors and vulnerable adults in order to improve the church’s safeguarding efforts.', 'The document notes the synodal process “does not conclude with the end of the current assembly.” Local churches are asked to continue “their daily journey with a synodal methodology of consultation and discernment,” identifying concrete ways to implement the synod’s findings in dioceses and parishes.', 'Or, as Pope Francis put it in his concluding remarks, the synodal Church now needs its words “to be accompanied by deeds.”', 'faith@freepress.mb.ca', 'The Free Press is committed to covering faith in Manitoba.

He noted the group will continue to do its work unhampered before reporting to the Pope in June.', 'Cardinal Mario Grech of Malta, secretary general for the synod, added men and women are already working together in the Church, and he hopes the Church “will go on recognizing the gifts” of women.', 'On the matter of making sure seminarians have access to instruction from women during their studies, Gresch said they will “profit greatly” when women are involved in their formation.', 'He went on to say that that is important because when they graduate as priests, they will be serving women “who make up more than one-half of the Church.”', 'When it comes to changes in the liturgy, Hollerich suggested “small things” could be changed. Many people have told him, he said, that the liturgy being used today “does not speak to them.” Sentiments like that must be taken “seriously,” he added.', 'At the same time, there is no plan for a “revolution” to the way Roman Catholics conduct their services, he said. It’s about being “more participatory.”', 'Grech said when the delegates met for the first time last year there was some “suspicion” in the assembly hall.', '“This year was completely different,” he said, although there were still disagreements.', 'He emphasized the synod was “not a policy meeting” where people tried to persuade others to vote their way, but an experience of working together across different cultures and contexts.', 'Hollerich said the synod was not a time of “liberal versus conservative battles.” Rather, it was a time when “we walked together.”', 'Now, he said, “It is time to give the people a chance to experience it, to become a real synodal Church … to do it in everyday life as it has received it from Christ.”', 'Gresch said, “Not everything was completely defined by the synod. We still need to move in areas of theology and pastoral study.
