Images of the object taken over the course of October show it brightening with outburst activity before dimming, its nucleus appearing to vanish, leaving behind a tail of dust and gas, and, maybe, a cloud of cometary debris.', ""It's a bit disappointing – but not entirely unexpected, as comets of this kind often disintegrate as they draw near the Sun."", 'There have been signs of instability in the comet. It has undergone at least one outburst, which is what it sounds like: a sudden release of dust and gas, causing the comet to brighten significantly, taking several days to return to normal.', 'This is not unusual behavior for a comet, but it can be a sign of nucleus fragmentation – where the main body, or nucleus, of a comet starts to break apart.', 'This probably happens because of what they are made of. Comets hail from the very cold outer reaches of the Solar System, and are laden with forms of ice.', ""Disintegration seems to happen very quickly, so the reasons why aren't entirely clear, but one possible explanation is that the sublimation of ice and release of gas and dust can cause the spin of the comet to accelerate, resulting in it breaking apart under centrifugal force."", 'We got a rare glimpse of this process in 2020, when Comet C/2019 Y4 shattered to smithereens when it drew near the Sun under the watchful eye of the Hubble Space Telescope.', ""A notice posted to Astronomer's Telegram on October 9 posits that changes in the appearance of the comet could be a sign of disintegration."", 'Since then, images taken on October 20 and 22 by amateur astronomer Martin Mašek of Czechia show that, sometime during that time frame, the cometary nucleus seems to have vanished from visibility, and has grown even dimmer still.', 'The visibility forecast for C/2024 S1 suggested that it may become brighter than Venus, and even be visible in the daytime sky. If the comet has undergone, or is undergoing fragmentation before perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, it may not be quite that bright, but there may still be something to see.', ""A large fragment of the nucleus may survive the disintegration process and continue the comet's journey towards the Sun. And the tail may continue to be visible even if the cometary nucleus disintegrates, at least for a short time."", 'Interestingly, C/2024 S1 is, itself, thought to be a fragment of a larger comet. All Kreutz sungrazers are thought to be what remains of the Great Comet of 1106 CE, which broke apart and formed many smaller comets as it looped around the Sun. Those smaller comets include Comet Ikeya-Seki of 1965, which lit up the sky nearly as brightly as the full Moon.', 'At the moment, the C/2024 S1 may be visible with binoculars or a small telescope in the Southern Hemisphere particularly. After perihelion, if the comet has survived, it should be visible in the Northern Hemisphere.', ""If the nucleus of C/2024 S1 disintegrates during perihelion, we could spot a long, curved tail, without a bright head.

', 'Back on Oct. 10, Space.com published an article indicating that this comet — which belongs to the Kreutz family of sungrazing comets — was in the process of disintegration and would likely not develop into an eye-catching object like its early October predecessor, Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS. ', 'However, an online story published this past Monday evening (Oct. 21) in a New York City tabloid, apparently ignited a renewed surge of excitement by indicating that Comet ATLAS would evolve into a ""Halloween treat"" which, according to a NASA official who was quoted in the article, ""may become bright enough to see during the daytime.""

For a more in-depth look at our Celestron NexStar 4SE review.', 'Comet ATLAS is more likely to simply disappear into the solar glare in the upcoming days. It has already shown indications that it is gradually breaking apart, which could be the main reason why it is brightening so very slowly as it races inward toward the sun. ', ""Normally, a potentially bright comet would tend to rapidly ramp-up in brightness as it gets progressively closer to the sun, but with less than a week to go before Comet ATLAS comes to within literally a hairbreadth of the sun's surface (called the photosphere), it has not brightened much at all. Most observers have placed it at around magnitude +10, which is still about 40 times dimmer than the faintest star that can be perceived with the naked-eye without any optical aid, and some have indicated that it has even faded in recent days.

"", 'Each of these pieces apparently swings extremely close to the sun, coming to within less than a million miles of its surface. Comet ATLAS is one of these fragments.

In order to survive, Comet ATLAS will whiz around the sun along a hairpin-curved shaped orbit at a speed of over a million miles (1.6 million km) per hour. But by that time, the damage may already have been done and nothing may remain on the comet's return to deep space."", 'Those of us here on Earth might be able to track the comet — if it is still intact — as it passes closest to the sun early on Monday, Oct. 28, using real-time imagery from the LASCO C3 coronagraph on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), which monitors the sun 24/7. Comet ATLAS will appear to pass very close above the sun around 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 28. Observers were able to follow Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS in this manner earlier this month. ', 'Comet ATLAS was discovered on Sept. 27 in Hawaii by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) project, the object was initially cataloged as ""A11bP7I."" But shortly thereafter, enough observations came in to confirm that it was indeed a comet and not an asteroid. When orbital calculations indicated that it belonged to the Kreutz family of sungrazing comets, a surge of excitement followed, because some Kreutz comets have evolved into some of the brightest on record. ', 'In addition, the Great Comets of 1680, 1811, 1843 and 1965 had gloriously bright tails stretching for many tens of millions of miles. Initially, it was hoped that Comet ATLAS would evolve into this type of comet, but we now know that is likely not going to happen.  ', 'On the other hand, there might still be something to see early on Halloween morning or during the opening days of November. It brings to mind a spooky Halloween tale: The Headless Horseman. It is a recurrent story involving a mythical figure whose origins can be traced back to Europe; traditionally depicting a rider on horseback who is missing his head.', 'As it turns out, according to astronomer Qicheng Zhang of Arizona\'s Lowell Observatory, Comet ATLAS ""... has almost certainly disintegrated,"" adding, ""There\'s probably not much left of its primary core."" That having been said, it now seems likely that even under the best of circumstances, this newcomer — after coming within a minim of the sun on Monday —  can only hope to present itself as a short-lived disembodied tail after it closely sweeps around the sun — if any sort of remnant is left at all. A headless comet is not unique. In January 1887, The Great Southern Comet of 1887 appeared and was seemingly all tail and no head. ', '', 'As a result, some older astronomical texts refer to it as the ""Headless Wonder"".', 'Then, in December 2011, Comet Lovejoy, another Kreutz sungrazing comet, disintegrated just before Christmas, leaving in its wake a bright tail that was seen both from the ground as well as the International Space Station.

In the sky, tiny stars appeared one by one, aligning into constellations.', 'Juan Carlos Hernández used his weight to adjust a large telescope. “Aim for me, Rich!” he yelled to his friend. Ricardo Soriano focused a green laser on a small patch of clouds, targeting where the Tsuchinshan-Atlas comet will soon be visible.', 'Hernández and other amateur astronomers worked to certify Joya-La Barreta Ecological Park last year as the first urban night sky space in Latin America by DarkSky International, an organization working to educate the public about the harm of indiscriminate lighting.', 'The park sitting at about 8,520 feet (2,600 meters) above sea level on the outskirts of Queretaro gives unobstructed access to the night sky. While over 200 dark sky places exist globally, Joya-La Barreta park is only one of 11 in areas that are considered urban. Its dark sky status is under constant threat, however, from increasing light pollution and urbanization.', 'Fading stars', 'Hernández, who just turned 40, has advocated relentlessly for the night sky for more than 20 years.', 'The president of Queretaro’s Astronomical Society and one of the founders of the stargazing tourism agency Astronite, the aerospace engineer by day has been chasing dark areas to observe the stars since he can remember.', '“In 2014 you could see Omega (Centauri) sitting in the sky just above the city,” he said of a constellation over 17,000 light years away. “Today it’s unimaginable.”', 'A 2023 study that analyzed data from more than 50,000 amateur stargazers found that artificial lighting is making the night sky across the world about 10% brighter each year. As of 2016, more than 80% of the world lived under light-polluted skies.', 'Studies in Mexico show that increased urbanization and the need for city lighting in relation to security issues have caused more light contamination.', 'Fernando Ávila Castro of the Institute of Astronomy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico said a good analogy to explain light pollution is noise pollution.', '“We constantly hear traffic noise from the street, but past a certain level that intensity becomes annoying, it doesn’t let you rest,” he said. “The same thing happens with light. Especially because all living beings have this internal clock, the circadian rhythm, which depends on the external values of light.”', '“When we go to sleep, we forget that an entire world remains active,” Castro said.', 'Under the spotlight', 'The moon and stars are the light source guiding nocturnal activity for plants and animals — determining when animals emerge from hiding to find food, when plants reproduce and when certain animal species migrate. Artificial light has boomed since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, with efficient, affordable LEDs the latest type in wide use.', '“There’s also this whole part about the biodiversity,” Analette Casazza, president of another Queretaro astronomy association, said while standing under the stars Saturday night. “We can hear the singing from all the animals that live here (in Joya-La Barreta). A lot of these pollinating animals, their activity is at night.”', 'Joya-La Barreta park hosts 123 species of vertebrates.', ""“The real challenge we have is to get citizens involved,” said María Guadalupe Espinosa de los Reyes Ayala, Queretaro's environment secretary. “When people arrive at a place like this and realize how much it has to offer, they see the need to protect and conserve it.”"", 'Conservation challenge', 'Hernández and other astronomy activists continue to fight to conserve the park’s nocturnal conditions and pass state regulations to reduce light pollution.', 'Hernández is also fighting for the enforcement of Mexico’s General Law of Ecological Balance, passed in 2021.', 'The law provides general recommendations to minimize light pollution. It’s been recognized in certain Mexican states like Sonora, Baja California and Hidalgo to protect observatories and professional astronomical observations. However in Queretaro, Hernández submitted an amendment to the state congress in 2023 to apply the regulations, but hasn’t had any luck.', 'Three times a year, the citizen astronomers at Joya-La Barreta have to submit light pollution reports to DarkSky. Increased light pollution levels or a lack of visitors to the park for astronomical activities can put their certification at risk. For Ricardo Soriano, another founder of Astronite, it’s a constant cause for concern.', '“If contamination continues to grow and the government doesn’t support us, and doesn’t do more to see more beyond our certification, then we can lose it,” Soriano said. “We’ll have to leave Queretaro to try to find another park like this. I hope they can see it as something important for the state and community.”', 'On Saturday, as the comet came into focus, 10-year-old Matti González, accompanied by his parents Antonio González and Brenda Estrella, burst into a smile looking through his telescope.', '“What are you going to dress up as for Halloween?” González asked his son. “An astronaut!” Matti yelled.', 'Throughout the night, Hernandez ran back and forth between attendees with a red headlight guiding his path. He explained certain celestial bodies or helped focus a scope on Saturn’s rings. Pausing for a moment, he thought about Carl Sagan, and how the astronomer said the same elements that form in the final gasps of a dying star — hydrogen, oxygen, carbon — are elements found in our bodies today.', '“Looking at the sky is the most spiritual experience there can be,” Hernández said excitedly. “It’s the connection to our true molecular origins, but also to our cosmic destiny.”', 'Looking up at the stars, he said: “For me, the most important thing is that the future generations know that a resource their grandparents had is being lost.”', '____', 'Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america', 'Mariana Martínez Barba, The Associated Press', 'Vote Results > Archives >', '© 2024 Delta Optimist']"

Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS is a Halloween visitor from the spooky Oort Cloud − the invisible bubble that's home to countless space objects,https://www.space.com/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-halloween-visitor-from-oort-cloud,"['The human mind may find it difficult to conceptualize...', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights."", 'James Wray is a Professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.', 'The human mind may find it difficult to conceptualize: a cosmic cloud so colossal it surrounds the Sun and eight planets as it extends trillions of miles into deep space.', 'The spherical shell known as the Oort Cloud is, for all practical purposes, invisible. Its constituent particles are spread so thinly, and so far from the light of any star, including the sun, that astronomers simply cannot see the cloud, even though it envelops us like a blanket.', 'It is also theoretical. Astronomers infer the Oort Cloud is there because it’s the only logical explanation for the arrival of a certain class of comets that sporadically visit our solar system. The cloud, it turns out, is basically a gigantic reservoir that may hold billions of icy celestial bodies. ', 'Two of those bodies will pass by Earth in the days leading up to Halloween. Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, also known as Comet C/2023 A3, will be at its brightest, and likely visible to the naked eye, for a week or two after Oct. 12, the day it’s closest to Earth – just look to the western sky shortly after sunset. As the days pass, the comet will get fainter and move to a higher part of the sky.', 'Related: Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS is still visible in the night sky, but not for long', 'Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!', 'The second comet, C/2024 S1 (ATLAS), just discovered on Sept. 27, should be visible around the end of October. The comet will pass closest to Earth on Oct. 24 – look low in the eastern sky just before sunrise. Then, after swinging around the sun, the comet may reappear in the western night sky right around Halloween. It’s possible, however, that it could disintegrate, in part or in whole, as sometimes happens when comets pass by the sun – and this one will come within 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) of our star.', 'As a planetary astronomer, I’m particularly curious about the Oort Cloud and the icy bodies inhabiting it. The Cloud’s residents may be a reason why life ignited on Earth; crashing on our planet eons ago, these ice bodies may have supplied at least some of the water that all life requires. At the same time, these same objects pose an ever-present threat to Earth’s continuation – and our survival. ', 'Some of these bodies, known as long-period comets, have orbits of hundreds, thousands or even millions of years, like Tsuchinshan-ATLAS. This is unlike the so-called short-period comets, which do not visit the Oort Cloud and have comparatively quick orbits. Halley’s comet, which cuts a path through the solar system and orbits the sun every 76 years or so, is one of them.', 'The 20th-century Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, intrigued by the long-period comets, wrote a paper on them in 1950. He noted about 20 of the comets had an average distance from the sun that was more than 10,000 astronomical units. This was astounding; just one AU is the distance of the Earth from the sun, which is about 93 million miles. Multiply 93 million by 10,000, and you’ll find these comets come from over a trillion miles away. What’s more, Oort suggested, they were not necessarily the cloud’s outermost objects.', 'Nearly 75 years after Oort’s paper, astronomers still can’t directly image this part of space. But they do estimate the Oort Cloud spans up to 10 trillion miles from the sun, which is almost halfway to Proxima Centauri, the next closest star.', 'The long-period comets spend most of their time at those vast distances, making only brief and rapid visits close to the sun as they come in from all directions. Oort speculated the cloud contained 100 billion of these icy objects. That may be as numerous as the number of stars in our galaxy.', 'How did they get there? Oort suggested, and modern simulations have confirmed, that these icy bodies could have initially formed near Jupiter, the solar system’s largest planet. Perhaps these objects had their orbits around the sun disturbed by Jupiter – similar to how NASA spacecraft bound for destinations from Saturn to Pluto have typically swung by the giant planet to accelerate their journeys outward.', 'Some of these objects would have escaped the solar system permanently, becoming interstellar objects. But others would have ended up with orbits like those of the long-period comets.', '', 'Long-period comets present a particular potential danger to Earth. Because they are so far from our sun, their orbits are readily altered by the gravity of other stars. That means scientists have no idea when or where one will appear, until it does, suddenly. By then, it’s typically closer than Jupiter and moving rapidly, at tens of thousands of miles per hour. Indeed, the fictional comet that doomed Earth in the film “Don’t Look Up” came from the Oort Cloud.', 'New Oort Cloud comets are discovered all the time, a dozen or so per year in recent years. The odds of any of them colliding with Earth are extremely low. But it is possible. The recent success of NASA’s DART mission, which altered the orbit of a small asteroid, demonstrates one plausible approach to fending off these small bodies. But that mission was developed after years of studying its target. A comet from the Oort Cloud may not offer that much time – maybe just months, weeks or even days.', 'Or no time at all. ’Oumuamua, the odd little object that visited our solar system in 2017, was discovered not before but after its closest approach to Earth. Although ’Oumuamua is an interstellar object, and not from the Oort Cloud, the proposition still applies; one of these objects could sneak up on us, and the Earth would be defenseless.', 'One way to prepare for these objects is to better understand their basic properties, including their size and composition. Toward this end, my colleagues and I work to characterize new long-period comets. The largest known one, Bernardinelli–Bernstein, discovered just three years ago, is roughly 75 miles (120 kilometers) across. Most known comets are much smaller, from one to a few miles, and some smaller ones are too faint for us to see. But newer telescopes are helping. In particular, the Rubin Observatory’s decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time, starting up in 2025, may double the list of known Oort Cloud comets, which now stands at about 4,500.', 'The unpredictability of these objects makes them a challenging target for spacecraft, but the European Space Agency is preparing a mission to do just that: Comet Interceptor. With a launch planned for 2029, the probe will park in space until a suitable target from the Oort Cloud appears. Studying one of these ancient and pristine objects could offer scientists clues about the origins of the solar system.', ""—\u200a Comets: Everything you need to know about the 'dirty snowballs' of space"", '— Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS photobombs SOHO spacecraft during powerful solar flare (video)', '— Hopes dim for another bright October comet after Tsuchinshan-ATLAS', 'As for the comets now in Earth’s vicinity, it’s OK to look up.
