Given the M4’s focus on AI, expect plenty of attention on Apple Intelligence, which comes to users as part of iOS 18.1’s update at the same time. That each model is likely to be announced piecemeal across the week, rather than at one glitzy event, suggests we won’t see too many other big changes.', 'The rumor suggests only the Mac Mini will get a major hardware revision, shrinking its chassis to a far smaller footprint. If I’m honest, I’m secretly hoping the Mac Mini doesn’t become the same size as an Apple TV model, which has been hinted at. Especially if it means saddling us with a beefy power brick to clutter the floor instead.', '— Dan Cooper', 'Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox.

However, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to gain an additional Thunderbolt port compared to the current model, based on alleged leaks earlier this month. Those same leaks revealed that the MacBook Pro lineup might finally start with 16GB of RAM, instead of 8GB, which was rumored even before the leaks happened.', 'Apple last redesigned the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2021, and the latest models with the M3 family of chips were released last October.', ""The next iMac is expected to be equipped with the standard M4 chip, up from the M3 chip in the current model released a year ago.

The M4 MacBook Pro coming next week might finally get everything right,https://www.macworld.com/article/2473123/m4-macbook-pro-2024-update-thunderbolt-memory-ram-space-black-price.html,"[""When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence."", 'According to the latest rumors, Apple will release its first M4 Macs next week. Among the new models, which include a redesigned Mac mini, will be the first refresh to the entry-level MacBook Pro released next year. Normally, such an update would be nothing more than a chip upgrade from the M3 to the M4. But a series of reports claim that there will be more to this update–and could make the 14-inch base model a near-perfect laptop for just about everyone.', 'The first report was by leaker VNChocoTaco on X, who posted a photo they received of the box label for the new MacBook Pro revealing key specs. The second report is from Russian YouTuber Wylsacom, who apparently got their hands on the M4 MacBook Pro, laptop and all.', 'If the information in these two reports holds up, and it would be a very elaborate hoax if it doesn’t, we could be seeing some big changes in the base M4 MacBook Pro. Here’s what’s being reported and what it could mean.', 'The current base M3 14-inch MacBook Pro has one glaring problem: It has only 8GB of unified memory. Apple will tell you that’s more than enough and 8GB is useable and for many buyers that’s probably true. But considering how much RAM higher-end software uses nowadays, 8GB in a “Pro” laptop is not enough. Still not convinced? How about this: The MacBook Air, Apple’s “consumer” laptop, the laptop for “everyone else,” also starts at 8GB of memory. The MacBook Pro is supposed to be the workstation laptop for, as the name says, the “Pro.” The other models all start at 18GB—does 8GB seem proper for a MacBook that costs $1,599?', 'Both reports by VNChocoTaco and Wylsacom show what appears to be a specifications label from the base M3 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, that shows a laptop with 16GB of memory. Assuming the model isn’t a higher-end configuration, that would mean Apple is finally addressing the biggest flaw of the entry-level Pro. With 16GB of RAM, pro users will be able to run their apps and feel comfortable about the laptop’s performance–they may still need more and upgrade to 24GB or more, and even then, it won’t be as expensive as starting from a standard configuration is 8GB.', 'VNChocoTaco’s photo is low resolution and much of the text is garbled, but it seems to show that the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro will have three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Wylsacom’s label says the same and he shows off the laptop’s three ports in his video. This seems to indicate that Apple is adding one more Thunderbolt/USB 4 to the base M4 model. This would put the laptop in line with the higher-end MacBook Pro models with Pro and Max chips; it would no longer have the same two ports as the MacBook Air, another step toward making it an actual “Pro” laptop.', 'When Apple introduced the M3 MacBook Pro, it revealed a new Space Black color option available only on the M3 Pro or M3 Max models. According to these reports, Apple is going to make Space Black an option on the base model, too.', 'I’m currently using a Space Black MacBook Pro, and my first impression of the color was that it was nice, but it should be darker. But after having used the laptop for nearly a year now, I love Space Black and it’s now my color of choice. If it’s coming to the M4 MacBook Pro, it’s going to be a popular choice—and put the entry-level model on par with the others.', 'There are other specs revealed by these reports, such as the M4’s 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and the same starting 512GB SSD. But the three changes above are going to make the base M4 MacBook Pro a popular laptop–especially if Apple keeps the price at $1,599.', 'It would be the first time in a long time that buying the least-expensive MacBook Pro didn’t mean you had to make a significant compromise, such as the 8GB of RAM, fewer ports, hampered performance, or even an old design, as was the case when Apple kept the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar around after the Apple silicon redesign was announced.', 'If and then this MacBook Pro does ship, it will fit right in with the M4 Pro and M4 Max models in the lineup and give users a real choice, rather than force them to the upper models due to cut-rate specs. Apple will sell a lot of them.', 'Apple is expected to announce M4 MacBook Pro and other M4 Macs sometime next week for delivery on November 1.

Among the anticipated models is a redesigned Mac mini featuring the M4 chipset. While the rest of the Mac lineup is expected to retain a similar design, the Mac mini is poised for a major revamp, with upgrades to both its design and power, thanks to the addition of the M4 chipset. This new model is rumoured to be as compact as the Apple TV 4K. With this smaller form factor and the M4 power, the Mac mini could become a game-changer for creatives.', ""Currently, Apple offers the Mac mini with the M2 chipset at a price of ₹59,900 in India, making it one of the most value-for-money computers on the market, especially given the M2's performance. If Apple prices the revamped M4 Mac mini similarly or even slightly higher, it would still be an excellent value, particularly for those entering fields like content creation or graphic design."", ""The M-series chips already enable multi-layered 4K video editing and provide smooth coding experiences. The addition of the M4 will only improve these capabilities. It's also worth noting that the Mac mini can be equipped with more powerful versions of the M2 chipset, such as the M2 Pro. It wouldn't be surprising to see an M4 Mac mini with an M4 Pro option, offering better power for high-end workflows."", 'Also Read: Apple’s most popular MacBook could be upgraded with the M4 chip next year', ""Another significant advantage of the M4 Mac mini could be its compact design. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the next Mac Mini might be similar in size to the Apple TV 4K. While the Mac mini is already compact, a smaller design would make it even more portable. For creators who work from home and want to use the same computer on the go, the Mac mini could easily fit in a backpack and connect to monitors, keyboards, and mice available in most offices. This portability could be a huge benefit for many users."", 'Also Read: Oppo Find N5 leak reveals bigger screen, triple cameras, enhanced battery and more: Here’s what to expect', 'M4 Mac mini might be the most affordable entry point for accessing the M4 chipset. If it remains priced similarly to the current model, or even at ₹15,000-20,000 more, it would still be cheaper than other M4-powered devices, such as the iPad Pro, which currently starts at ₹99,900, or the rumoured MacBook Pro M4, likely to be priced above ₹1,50,000. Thus, the Mac mini could be the most cost-effective way to experience the power of the M4 chipset in a Mac.', 'The inclusion of Apple Intelligence is another major attraction. All Apple computers with M1 and later chipsets support Apple Intelligence, but the M4 series, with faster neural processing, would provide the ideal experience for these features.', ""Also Read: iPhone SE 4 launch in March 2025: From price, specs to AI, here's everything we know"", '', '', '']"
I just broke the first rule of buying Apple products — I bought a new Mac Mini ahead of the M4 Mac launch,https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/desktop-computers/i-just-broke-the-first-rule-of-buying-apple-products-i-bought-a-new-mac-mini-ahead-of-the-m4-mac-launch,"['Sometimes you just have to try things out for yourself', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'Apple is expected to announce a brand new, completely redesigned Mac mini M4 early next week. However, last Friday, I finally decided to pick up a Mac mini for myself after eying up Cupertino’s smallest Mac for what seems like ages.', 'It’s not everyday I outright buy a new computer, though I do get a chance to try out a lot of different machines as part of my job testing and reviewing the best mini PCs. The problem is that there’s one very iconic mini PC I just haven’t had a chance to try yet and come next week, the Mac mini M2 will likely be completely overshadowed by this new model.', 'Just like with the best iPhones, you definitely don’t want to pick up a new Mac days ahead of the release of its successor, especially since Apple products tend to remain at or around their launch price for years. However, when I found out that this was the year that Apple would finally give the Mac mini’s design a major revamp while ditching its USB-A ports, I figured what did I have to lose.', 'To that end, I ordered the base model of the Mac mini M2 as I also wanted to put the company’s claims about 8GB of RAM being enough for most people to the test. I did consider upgrading to 16GB of RAM but that configuration needs to be ordered directly from Apple with a longer wait time if you don’t want to end up overpaying a third-party seller online. Fortunately, we might soon be able to put this debate to rest once and for all as the base models of its M4 Macs will reportedly ship with 16GB of RAM as the new standard. I guess we’ll find out next week.', 'As for me, I just spent a week with the base Mac Mini M2 after not having used macOS for almost 20 years. Here’s why it’s still a great mini PC even if it’s about to be replaced by something even smaller and much more powerful thanks to the addition of Apple’s M4 chip.', '', 'While the Mac mini got its iconic aluminum unibody redesign back in 2010, the original version was first introduced by Steve Jobs all the way back in 2005. At that time, Jobs described it as “very, very tiny” and the “mini” in its name actually comes from the iPod mini.', 'Before the Mac mini, Apple sold desktops, all-in-one computers and laptops but not a device that was “BYODKM” or bring your own display, keyboard and mouse. The reasoning behind this new Mac not shipping with a mouse and keyboard was that people likely already had their own accessories and being able to use them on their new computer made it a lot easier to switch from Windows to Mac.', 'The Mac mini has changed quite a lot over the years too. The original had a white polycarbonate plastic top, aluminum sides and a disc drive. The top eventually became aluminum as well and the disc drive became unnecessary as the years went by too.', 'Mac mini M2: was $599 now $500 @ Amazon\nThe Mac mini M2 is the most affordable Mac you can get and right now, you can save $100 off the base model with an M2 chip, 8GB unified memory and a 256GB SSD. While there aren’t any ports on the front, around back you get two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, a headphone jack and an Ethernet port.', 'In the coming days, we’ll likely see an even smaller Mac mini as it’s rumored to sport similar dimensions to the current Apple TV. It could also be a bit taller though, which would make it look a lot more like a scaled down version of the Mac Studio. The resemblance will be even more striking if Apple adds extra ports to the Mac mini M4’s front panel like some recent reports have suggested it will.', '', 'Besides the upgrade to an M4 chip and a smaller footprint overall, the other big change we’re likely to see with the Mac mini M4 is with its ports. Yes, we’re potentially getting more of them but at a steep cost — at least in my opinion. While the standard Mac mini M2 has two Thunderbolt ports and two USB-A ports, the Mac mini M2 Pro (pictured above) has four Thunderbolt ports.', 'With the Mac mini M4, Apple is apparently going to get rid of the device’s USB-A ports altogether and go with five Thunderbolt ports instead. Don’t get me wrong, I love USB-C as it’s a huge improvement over Micro USB but I’ve always had a soft spot for USB-A. Going from USB-A to USB-C is great for things like connecting external displays or charging, but the same can’t be said when it comes to accessories.', 'If you switch between computers as often as I do, unpairing and then repairing Bluetooth devices gets to be quite annoying. This is why I often use 2.4 Ghz USB dongles with the best mechanical keyboards and my trusty trackball mouse when possible. That way, I just unplug the dongle on one machine and then plug it into another and I’m ready to go.', 'This switch from USB-A to all USB-C ports is one of the reasons I picked up a Mac mini M2, even though I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of the Mac mini M4. However, since the design of the Mac mini has remained unchanged for more than a decade, there are a lot of great accessories for it and this was the other reason I wanted to try out this particular Mac.', '', 'In order to make the Mac mini work for me, I was going to need some more ports as well as a microSD card reader. Fortunately, there are several docks and hubs that do just this. However, none of them look quite as clean and mesh with the Mac mini as well as the Satechi Mac Mini Hub.', 'It slides right under your Mac mini — or even your Mac Studio — to give you extra ports on the front of your computer. In total, you get a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, a microSD and SD card reader and a headphone jack that’s easier to reach. There are also two versions: one with a slot for an M.2 SSD on the bottom and a slightly cheaper one that you can’t add extra storage too.', '', 'Satechi sent over the former for me to test out after I did a story on adding their aluminum USB headphone stand to my desk setup. Before going through the setup process on my new Mac mini M2, I flipped over the USB hub and used the included tiny screwdriver to add a 1TB M.2 SSD to the bottom. This took only a minute or so to do but now, I wouldn’t be limited by the 256GB SSD on my base model Mac mini nor would I need to invest in more iCloud storage.', '', 'The best part, you get all these extra ports and card readers and you only have to give up one Thunderbolt port on the back. This worked out perfectly for me as I planned on using the Mac mini’s HDMI port to connect to an ultrawide monitor and the other Thunderbolt port with a portable monitor for a quick and easy dual-monitor setup. Also, the non-pro Mac mini M2 only supports two external displays anyway.', 'Satechi Mac Mini Hub & Stand with SSD Enclosure: was $99 now $89 @ Amazon\nThis hub from Satechi goes under your Mac mini or Mac Studio to give you more ports and you can even install a M.2 SSD on the bottom. All of these extra ports are on the front so they’re easy to reach and this hub is powered by a single Thunderbolt port on the back of your Mac.', '', 'Instead of swapping out the Acemagic F2A mini PC that’s currently set up at my main desk, I decided to build a new desk setup from the ground up just for the Mac mini M2. This way I’d always be able to run back to the comfort of my office if the Spinning Wait Cursor — also known as the Spinning Beach Ball of Death (SBBOD) — did me in. And this was a very real possibility given the sheer amount of Chrome tabs I have open at a time while working.', 'For this particular desk setup, I used one of the best standing desks from Uppeal. I figured the company’s 2 Leg Desk ($1,129, Uppeal) would help me channel my inner Steve Jobs as it’s one of the only desks you can use while sitting on the floor which he was known for doing in Apple’s early days. I paired this desk with one of the best office chairs in case floor sitting wasn’t for me though and I thought the black and white design of X-Chair’s XS-Vision chair ($599, X-Chair) was a perfect fit for this setup.', '', 'I initially thought going back to macOS after almost two decades of using Windows exclusively would be difficult but surprisingly, it was a lot like getting back on a bike for the first time in ages. That iconic Mac startup sound hit me with a wave of nostalgia and it reminded me of turning on my Power Mac G4 for the first time back in 2001.', 'Once the initial setup process was complete, I reacquainted myself with macOS. From the Menu Bar at the top to the Dock at the bottom of my screen, I was reminded of all things I used to love about my big old Mac desktop. After I started dragging apps into the operating system’s Applications folder and I mounted my recently installed 1TB SSD on the Mac mini’s desktop, I was ready to start using Apple’s smallest Mac for work.\n\nI started off pretty easy by checking my email, jumping on a few video calls with the rest of the Tom’s Guide team and doing some research on upcoming stories. Just like with my Windows PCs though, I wanted to use this computer the way I liked which is why I downloaded and installed Chrome instead of switching to Safari. Fortunately, Google added a Memory Saver mode to its browser a few years back but even with it turned on, I knew I was getting close to the threshold of my Mac mini’s available RAM. To be sure, I pulled up the Activity Monitor app every now and then and as I thought, I was using 7 out of 8GB of RAM.', '', 'The switch from using my favorite Windows keyboard shortcuts to their Mac equivalents threw me through a bit of a loop too. I knew this would be difficult though, so I used my favorite mechanical keyboard for traveling as it has both operating system’s key names on the bottom row. I do have a NuPhy Air60 on hand too but in the rush to build a desk, assemble a chair and get everything set up, I didn’t want to be bothered with switching keycaps. I might do that later on though as the Ukvey C68 keyboard ($40, Amazon) pales in comparison to one of NuPhy’s low-profile keyboards.', 'Another thing that threw me off at first was not having native window snapping like in Windows or even ChromeOS. To that end, I downloaded and set up Rectangle before remembering that Apple had in fact added window snapping with the release of macOS Sequoia just last month.', 'So did I make a mistake by buying a Mac mini M2 just days ahead of the Mac mini M4’s launch? Kind of. Buyer’s remorse could set in big time next week but given my penchant for USB-A ports, I still think the older design of the Mac mini M2 is the right choice for me. Granted though, I definitely should have gone with the M2 Pro version for the extra RAM and larger storage.', 'I still have a few days left to make my final decision but part of me really just wants to return the base model Mac mini M2 and splurge a bit on the Mac mini M2 Pro. Overall, I really do prefer smaller mini PCs but I can’t justify a thinner and lighter device at the cost of a very standard port that’s been going strong for 28 years now. Then again, I’m sure Satechi and other Mac accessory makers are already working on similar hubs for the Mac mini M4.', 'We’ll see, maybe Apple can convince me that the Mac mini M4 really is the better choice after all. For that though, I’d need to see an actual presentation instead of learning about the new iPad mini like I did in a press release earlier this week. Fingers crossed we get an epic MacBook Air-style reveal for the Mac mini M4 after a “one more thing” from Tim Cook.', 'Either way, I’m glad I took the time to give macOS another shot after all these years and one way or another, I plan on living a multi-OS life going forward to get the best from both Windows and Mac.', 'Here at Tom’s Guide our expert editors are committed to bringing you the best news, reviews and guides to help you stay informed and ahead of the curve!', 'Anthony Spadafora is the security and networking editor at Tom’s Guide where he covers everything from data breaches and ransomware gangs to password managers and the best way to cover your whole home or business with Wi-Fi.

This is the Mac Mini’s big moment,https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278827/apple-mac-mini-m4-redesign-preview,"['By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos.', 'When the Mac Mini was first introduced in early 2005, it was pitched as a compact “stripped-down” desktop — and the most affordable Mac in Apple’s lineup. Steve Jobs referred to it as a “BYODKM” system: you’d bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse, and the Mini would provide a dependable computing experience with all the benefits of macOS.', 'The Mac Mini has carried on ever since. There have been periods where the Mini has been sidelined and ignored by Apple for long stretches of time. But the debut of Apple Silicon gave it a new lease on life. Even if the overall design didn’t change much in the transition from Intel to Apple’s in-house chips, the Mini’s potential soared.', 'But now, that design is about to change. And if the rumors prove accurate, it’s going to be a radical makeover. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has reported that the M4-powered Mac Mini will shrink in size so significantly that its footprint will resemble that of an Apple TV. The new Mac Mini will be anything but a stripped-down Mac.', 'Instead, it’ll likely be the most visually impressive example yet of what Apple is capable of in this new era, where the incredible efficiency of its chips allows for all sorts of hardware designs that were technically unfeasible a handful of years ago. I haven’t been this excited about a new Mac since the phenomenal M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pros were released in 2021.', 'Gurman has said that the 2024 Mac Mini — at least the M4 Pro variant — will include a total of five USB-C ports, with two on the front of the machine. I consider that frontside I/O to be a godsend after years of having to turn the Mini around to plug anything in — or just guessing at it. It’ll still have an HDMI port for those of you who’ve integrated Apple’s smallest Mac into your home theater setups. USB-A is said to be a goner, but... it’s time.', 'Within the Mac family, the Mini still holds an important spot. The iMac is the visual stunner; the MacBook Pro delivers tremendous power on the go; and the Mac Pro and Mac Studio are both geared at professionals and creatives. But the Mini remains the line’s unassuming overperformer at a compelling price for anyone who wants a Mac that “just works.”', 'No matter its size, the Mini’s BYODKM remains one of its best attributes. Apple might not be planning a 27-inch iMac, but we’re about to have an astonishingly compact desktop that can be paired with any screen you want. And the software outlook is also excellent: the revamped Mini arrives shortly after macOS Sequoia, which added useful features like iPhone mirroring and (long overdue) window tiling.', 'It’ll take some kind of colossal, unforeseen deal-breaker for me not to immediately preorder the M4 Mac Mini as my new at-home machine. If I’ve got one concern, it’s that Apple will find some way to artificially hold the Mini back so as not to steal too much thunder from the Mac Studio. But I don’t think that’ll be the case — at least not to an egregious degree. As of now, the Studio easily wins out in CPU and GPU performance, and it has other bonuses, like an SD card slot and faster ethernet. I’d expect those advantages to remain true whenever the M4 model arrives.', 'Apple’s Mac portfolio has never been on a better path. And for those who’ve stuck with the company’s products for decades, that can still be hard to believe — even this deep into the age of Apple Silicon. We’ve been through some dark days. But with a new Mac Mini that looks equal parts streaming box and miniature PC, Apple seems poised for another M-series marvel — and feather in its cap.', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'For the first episode in our new miniseries about the impact of AI in our everyday lives, we chat with Steven Johnson, a longtime author who has spent the last couple of years at Google working on an AI research and note-taking tool called NotebookLM.

This includes the first wave of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 and the M4 Mac line-up. But it is still just hints to speculate on. Rumours suggest Apple will unveil multiple M4-powered Macs, including an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. Additionally, an all-new Mac Mini is expected in M4 and M4 Pro variants, alongside an upgraded iMac with an M4 processor. The upcoming Mac Mini is Apple's smallest ever desktop, as per the claims.

The device is set to feature Apple’s M4 chip, expected to deliver a significant speed boost over previous generations with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and an enhanced 16-core Neural Engine, ideal for AI-heavy tasks. This will be particularly useful for applications involving machine learning and creative workloads.', 'The M4 Mac mini is also slated for a major physical redesign, reducing its footprint to almost half of the current model, making it roughly comparable in size to an Apple TV. It may, however, be slightly taller than the previous Mac mini model to accommodate internal components. Connectivity will focus on USB-C, as the traditional USB-A ports are expected to be removed, leaving five USB-C ports, an HDMI output, Ethernet, and a headphone jack. It might carry an aluminium shell. The report claims that the new Mac mini is essentially an iPad Pro in a small box. This approach takes advantage of the lower power requirements of the company’s in-house silicon.', '', 'Another notable update is the integration of macOS 15, known as ""Sequoia,"" which will bring enhanced AI features, new Siri capabilities, and improved performance across the board, aligning with the Mac mini’s advanced Neural Engine.', 'Pricing is likely to start around $599, in line with the current M2 Mac mini, and Apple may announce the M4 Mac mini as early as the end of October 2024, with shipping possibly beginning in November.', 'This release could position the M4 Mac mini as an appealing choice for both casual and professional users seeking powerful desktop computing in a smaller, more energy-efficient form factor.', '']"

Accordingly, the next Mac Mini might be introduced as the ultimate all-round desktop for the home as soon as tomorrow (October 28, 2024.)"", ""Then again, that could make Apple's smallest new PC exceptionally pricey for its size, particularly as its 32GB M2 Pro predecessor remains at $1,832.99 on Amazon right now."", 'Mark Gurman via Bloomberg']"

With rumors swirling about a completely overhauled new model that is likely just days away from being announced, anticipation is building for what Apple has in store."", 'From enhanced connectivity to major hardware upgrades, the upcoming Mac mini promises to bring significant improvements that make it more compelling than ever. Here are five reasons to get excited about the next generation of this beloved small form-factor desktop.', 'Apple is planning to debut completely redesigned Mac mini models, according to Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman. The new \u200cMac mini\u200c will be the first major design change to the machine since 2010, and is expected to become Apple\'s smallest ever desktop computer. The slimmed down machine will retain its aluminum casing and be comparable in size to the Apple TV, though it is expected to be taller. Individuals working on the new device reportedly say that it is ""essentially an iPad Pro in a small box.""', ""According to Mark Gurman and a leaked Apple report, the next Mac mini is expected to come with five USB-C ports. Similar to the Mac Studio, two of these ports are anticipated to be positioned on the front. It's likely that some of these will support Thunderbolt 4, utilizing the same USB-C interface. However, the full set of five ports might only be available on the M4 Pro versions of the Mac mini."", ""The next Mac mini will come in both M4 and M4 Pro configurations, a significant step up from the current M2 and M2 Pro models. Like the M3, the M4 is built on a 3nm process, but with enhancements from Apple supplier TSMC for improved performance and power efficiency. The M4 also includes an improved Neural Engine that fuels accelerated AI workloads. Apple says it is the company's most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second, so there's plenty of scope for faster compute speeds."", ""Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported in August that Apple has tested four new Mac models equipped with an M4 chip, and all of them have either 16GB or 32GB of unified memory. The adequacy of 8GB of RAM in Macs has been a contentious issue for over a decade. That has left Apple open to criticism from users who believe that 8GB is not a sufficient amount of RAM for most creative professional workflows, so the news that 16GB is likely to be the new minimum will surely be a welcome development."", 'Apple is expected to emphasize the artificial intelligence capabilities of the M4 chip series, and the first Apple Intelligence features are expected to arrive with the release of macOS Sequoia 15.1 on October 28, which is right around the time we are expecting a Mac mini announcement. The initial release will focus on new Siri features, Smart Replies in Mail and Messages, Priority messages in the Mail app, Memory Movie and Clean Up in Photos, and more, with additional features coming in phased updates over the next several months.', 'The new-look Mac mini is expected to be announced by Apple before the end of October, with a launch to follow in early November.

However, it's possible they could debut in early November as well."", 'The entire Mac line-up is getting an M4 makeover, too. There will reportedly be at least three varieties of the M4 chip, most likely following a similar pattern to the current M3 line-up, which includes the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max.', ""The M2 series had a fourth member, the M2 Ultra, which has yet to appear in M3 form. Apple may bring the Ultra back with the M4 series, although it likely won't arrive until 2025 if Apple still plans to release an M3 Ultra Mac."", 'In July 2024, Mark Gurman hinted that the group of M4 Macs launching in 2024 includes the MacBook Pro M4, Mac Mini M4, and iMac M4. The Mac Mini M4 is rumored to be the smallest computer Apple has ever released. The MacBook Air M4, Mac Pro M4, and Mac Studio M4 will follow sometime in the first half of 2025, most likely in either March or June.', 'For the MacBook Air M4 specifically, Gurman estimates it could launch between January and March 2025.', 'That means the M4 Mac line-up release dates could be as follows:', ""The highlight of the M4 generation is AI, so we can expect to see Apple show off on-device AI capabilities when they unveil the first M4 Macs. After all, Apple Intelligence — Apple's new AI platform — was first announced at WWDC 2024 in June and is finally set to debut in iOS 18.1 on October 28, just days before the rumored launch of M4 Macs. At an October 30 event, it'd be easy for Apple to show off new AI features on both iPhones and M4-powered Macs."", '', ""It's difficult to understate the importance of AI in the next generation of Apple products. While it was a little late to the party, Apple has joined the AI boom with the announcement of its new Apple Intelligence platform. This upcoming suite of AI features will roll out in stages over the next several months and into 2025, possibly even later."", 'In a recent interview between The Wall Street Journal and Craig Federighi, Apple\'s Senior VP of Software Engineering, it was made clear that Apple doesn\'t plan to rush out any of its AI features. Federighi told the WSJ: ""This is a many-year, honestly, even decadeslong arc of this technology playing out, and so we’re going to do it responsibly.""', ""Despite the potentially long waiting period for all Apple Intelligence features to roll out, it'll no doubt play a major role in Apple's plans for the M4 Macs."", ""When Apple announced Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, it focused heavily on privacy and security, which have become major concerns after controversy surrounding leaders in the AI world like OpenAI. Privacy has always been a top priority for Apple, so it's no surprise that the company is making it a central part of its AI plans."", ""However, making AI completely private is no small feat. The best strategy for ensuring privacy is keeping all of the AI's processing on the user's device (that is, no data gets sent to a cloud server where it might be saved, exposed, or exploited). The only challenge is, on-device AI requires quite a bit of processing power."", '', ""That's where Apple's M-series chips come in. Apple has been slowly beefing up the neural processing units (NPUs) in its M-series chips, which means these chips are getting better and better at processing AI tasks all by themselves — no cloud servers required."", ""NPU performance got a slight nod in Apple's announcement for the M4 chip in May with the new iPad Pro's arrival, but it will probably be a star of the show in the M4 Mac presentation since people are far more likely to use a Mac for AI tasks than an iPad."", 'The first round of Apple Intelligence features is out on macOS 15 as of October 21. With the iOS 15.1 update, users can take advantage of basic Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools, Smart Replies, Clean Up in Photos, an enhanced Siri, and more.', 'With Apple Intelligence features live on M3 Macs before M4-powered Macs debut, Apple will want to emphasize that the M4 Macs have the strongest on-device AI performance yet, both to promote the new Macs and encourage people to try out Apple Intelligence.', 'The M4 Pro and M4 Max chips will also likely get a greater NPU performance boost to offer even more AI processing power.', '', ""Since the launch of Apple Silicon in 2020, Apple has announced new M-series chips in Mac devices first. So it's perplexing that Apple chose to start with the iPad for the M4 generation."", ""One possible reason for this unusual release schedule could simply be awkward timing. Apple launched the first round of M3 Macs in October 2023, but it didn't release any new iPads in 2023. Rather than launching an M4 Mac only 7 months later, Apple opted for a new iPad Pro instead."", ""Plus, it was no secret back in May that several of Apple's competitors were getting ready to launch devices with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, one of the only AI processors that can compete with the M4 chip. Apple likely wanted to announce the M4 chip before the first devices with the Snapdragon X Elite hit shelves, which happened in mid-June, just days after WWDC 2024."", 'Due to the timing of its Mac release schedule, starting with an M4 Mac may have been technologically unfeasible and could have hurt M3 Mac sales. The iPad, on the other hand, was long overdue for a refresh.', ""The iPad is also a less complicated device than the Mac line-up, particularly the high-end Macs. The iPad doesn't need the more powerful versions of the M4 chip like the M4 Pro or Max. By starting with the iPad, Apple was able to get the M4 generation out the door while still giving its product development teams more time to get the more powerful versions of the M4 chip ready for the Mac line-up."", ""While Mac fans may be disappointed they won't be getting the M4 chips first, it looks like they won't have to wait much longer. We'll be covering all the latest rumors and news on the M4 Macs, Apple Silicon, and Apple Intelligence, so stay tuned for more info."", 'Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in keyboards, peripherals, gaming gear, and mobile tech.

Along with recent rumors surrounding production of the M4 MacBook Air, it looks like it could be a very exciting week for Apple fans - so here’s what we expect to see."", '', 'With Apple’s M4 Pro and Max chips yet to be unveiled, this upcoming showcase could be the ideal opportunity to show off the powerful M4 variants, especially as the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch models will almost certainly be revealed, with Apple hopefully highlighting the major performance leap from the previous M3 Pro and Max chips.', 'Russian YouTuber Wylascom supposedly leaked a new model of the MacBook Pro that comes with the standard M4 chip, which if legitimate, means the base configuration of the laptop will utilize a 10-core CPU and GPU just like the M4 iPad Pro, as opposed to the M3’s 8-core CPU, potentially indicating a new focus on Apple Intelligence (the company’s fledgling attempt at artificial intelligence) - though Wylascom’s info should of course be taken with a grain of salt.', 'The one change over last year’s M3 version we do hope to see is that the base model of any new MacBook Pro comes with at least 16GB of unified memory rather than 8GB - this will be highly beneficial for gaming, which is becoming a prominent new focus for Mac devices with recent releases like the Resident Evil 4 remake. Of course, any laptop that’s marketed at content creators and professionals in 2024 really shouldn’t be coming with just 8GB of memory.', 'Expected alongside the M4 MacBook Pro reveal is a redesigned M4 Mac mini, with Apple’s plans to make it the smallest computer it has made - at least, as reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman (who has a strong reputation as a reliable leaker of all-things Apple). Its size is expected to be similar to the Apple TV, which should prove to be highly beneficial for those looking for sleek desktop setups.', 'Fortunately, its unified memory will reportedly be starting at 16GB, and maxing out at 32GB.

This makes sense considering the recent poor sales of Mac products, and how popular the MacBook Air is - Apple will likely be keen to announce a new and improved version of its biggest laptop seller as soon as possible (without annoying anyone who has recently bought the M3 model).', 'As reported by Mark Gurman, the M4 MacBook Air will reportedly remain the same in terms of its design, with the M4 chip being the only major alteration.', 'This is good news for anyone looking forward to buying a MacBook Air. The difference between 8GB and 16GB unified memory models was very significant on the M3 model, so expect the same to apply to the incoming M4 MacBook Air.', '', 'Finally, since Apple’s focus is supposedly zeroed in on M4 MacBook Air production for early 2025, the somewhat unloved chunky boy that is the Mac Studio is expected to arrive with M4 at a later date (again, according to Gurman’s sources). The Mac Studio is essentially a powerful mini PC that looks like a bulkier Mac mini, but aimed at creative professionals. It was claimed to be in simultaneous production alongside the MacBook Air, but this has apparently changed - the current expectation is between March and June, so not too long after the MacBook Air.', 'Do you have a particular Mac product you’re looking forward to?
