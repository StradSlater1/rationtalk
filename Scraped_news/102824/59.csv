DeVonta Smith’s improbable TD catch for the Eagles underscores a bounce-back day vs. Bengals,https://www.inquirer.com/eagles/eagles-devonta-smith-touchdown-jalen-hurts-bengals-20241027.html,"['After registering just one catch for minus-2 yards against the Giants last weekend, Smith responded with one of the best catches of his career.', 'CINCINNATI — It was late in the first quarter when the intrusive thoughts won over in DeVonta Smith’s head.', 'We ain’t doing this again.', 'In the early going of the Eagles’ dominant 37-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, the wide receiver was thrown down for a 2-yard loss on his first catch of the day. He had plenty of time to amend the broken play, but the stat line looked all too familiar. One catch, minus-2 yards.', 'Smith had been a good sport a week earlier when his limited role in a blowout win against the Giants resulted in the same exact numbers. The Eagles’ history of overcorrecting to a quiet game from one of their stars the last few years even suggested Smith would be featured early and often this Sunday, but the 25-year-old finished the opening series with a similar lack of involvement, an identical stat sheet, and a determination to avoid another week of going backward.', '“Today, I wasn’t happy when that happened,” Smith said of his opening catch. “I was like, ‘Nah, we ain’t doing this again.’ But it’s just trusting my training, continuing to go out there and make the most of my opportunities. When the ball comes to you, make it.”', '» READ MORE: Eagles grades vs. Bengals: Offense clicks with Jalen Hurts at his best and Saquon Barkley going over 100 yards', 'Smith did just that, making an improbable contested catch for a 45-yard touchdown that proved instrumental in the Eagles cruising to their most convincing win of the season. Finishing with six catches for a team-high 85 receiving yards and the score, the star wideout made a handful of timely plays to help the Eagles convert on third downs during the second half as well.', 'After the game, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni alluded to the offense’s tendency to feature Smith, A.J. Brown, or Dallas Goedert heavily the week after a quiet game. He didn’t get the numbers exactly right — Smith had eight catches for 169 yards and a touchdown in Week 3 of the 2022 season against the Washington Commanders two games after having zero catches against the Lions — but the sentiment holds true. Smith has never gone consecutive games with fewer than four targets and has typically followed up his worst statistical performances with big games the following week.', '“He made clutch catches,” Sirianni said. “Not a surprise, the last time he was shut out in a game — he had one for minus-2 last week — but the last time he was shut out in a game he came back and had, I think, like eight for 176. That’s how the game goes, that’s why you can’t overreact when things happen.”', 'Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts added, “We’ve got a lot of talent, we’ve got a lot of mouths to feed. That’s something that we have to navigate as a team, but the one thing I’m confident in is everyone being ready when their opportunity and their number is called. He made some huge plays down the stretch of the game down the field, and then on third downs he showed up big. I think that was a great showing for him and a great showing for our offense and our team.”', 'Smith’s biggest play came late in the third quarter with the score tied at 17. The Eagles identified zone coverage by motioning tight end Jack Stoll across the formation and called a play-action deep shot that sent Smith and Brown on routes down the field. Isolated against Cincinnati safety Jordan Battle, Smith gained some separation but still needed to high-point the ball with Battle scrambling to recover.', '“We knew we were going to get the one-on-one coverage,” Smith said. “Jalen, he trusted me to go up there, one-on-one, and win a 50-50 ball.”', 'Sparked by the big play, the Eagles went on to score 20 unanswered points with Smith contributing two critical third-down catches to help the offense salt the game away.', 'The touchdown catch is the type of play Smith has developed a reputation for during his Eagles tenure despite having a slender frame. He said he hadn’t watched the catch back after the game, so he wasn’t sure where it may rank among his best plays over the last few years.', 'Brown, Smith’s running mate, said his vantage point was good enough to confirm it will rank highly.', '“It’s up there,” Brown said. “I got a live view. It’s up there.”', 'There’s an irony in Smith adding to his highlight reel so emphatically just one week after his most impactful plays came blocking for Saquon Barkley at MetLife Stadium. That wasn’t lost on him as he walked toward the podium shortly after the final whistle with “September” blaring through a jubilant Eagles locker room and competing with his voice in an adjacent room.', '“I ain’t done one of these in a while.”']"

Eagles grades vs. Bengals: Offense clicks with Jalen Hurts at his best and Saquon Barkley going over 100 yards,https://www.inquirer.com/eagles/eagles-bengals-grades-jalen-hurts-saquon-barkley-nick-sirianni-20241027.html,"[""The Eagles' play-action opened up the offense as Hurts' deep shot to DeVonta Smith was the go-ahead score. Credit the play-calling."", 'CINCINNATI — Instant grades on the Eagles’ performance in a 37-17 win over the Bengals:', 'Jalen Hurts had his best game of the season and probably since the Week 12 overtime win over the Bills last season. He had a few early hiccups, including a dangerous check-down pass to Kenneth Gainwell that could have been picked off in the second quarter. But Hurts rebounded and was stellar through the air and on the ground the rest of the way.', 'He completed 16 of 20 passes for 236 yards and a touchdown. He also scored three rushing touchdowns — two Tush Pushes and a 7-yard run off the zone read in the third quarter. He had several big-time throws — the best a 17-yarder to A.J. Brown that converted a third-and-16 in the second quarter and a perfectly placed 45-yard bomb to DeVonta Smith in the end zone.', 'Saquon Barkley had some tough early rushes against the Bengals defense that was intent on stopping the run. But he got going in the fourth quarter as the Eagles’ four-minute offense pounded Cincinnati and closed out the game. Barkley went over 100 yards on the ground for the fourth time this season and finished with 108 yards on 22 carries.', 'Gainwell wasn’t used as much as he was a week ago, and had just two touches. Ben VanSumeren continued to play the occasional fullback. He had a decent lead block on a Barkley 11-yard run in the fourth quarter. Rookie Will Shipley had a touchdown run negated by a Nick Gates hold in the latter moments of the game.', 'Eagles receivers made the best of their opportunities. After a couple of quiet games, Smith got off the schneid with a 45-yard touchdown catch on a third-quarter jump ball. Earlier, he caught his first positive-yardage pass in some time with a 15-yard third-down grab in the third quarter. He had several over-the-middle grabs in the fourth.', 'Brown finished with five catches for 84 yards. He caught a 29-yard pass over the middle on the first drive and Grant Calcaterra got his second straight start at tight end with Dallas Goedert still sidelined with a hamstring injury. He had a couple of long catches for 28 and 19 yards and finished with three catches for 58 yards. Jack Stoll caught a 6-yard pass off a bootleg, and got hurt on the play, but he returned.', 'Ainias Smith, in his first NFL game, got some snaps. He wasn’t targeted, though.', 'Down two starters, the O-line won the battle up front. Fred Johnson did yeoman’s work against Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson. The left tackle, who’s been filling in for the injured Jordan Mailata, didn’t need a lot of help either. Hendrickson finished without a pressure. Tyler Steen held up in place of Mekhi Becton (concussion) at right guard. He had a couple of first-half penalties — a questionable hold and deserved personal foul — but he also had some good blocks as the Eagles shifted into run mode.', 'Lane Johnson left for one play in the first half. Johnson, left guard Landon Dickerson, and center Cam Jurgens all deserve credit for Hurts not getting sacked.', 'The Eagles front played a large role in holding Bengals running backs to just 43 yards on 17 carries. Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter led the way in the middle of the D-line. Davis played more than he did last week when he was on the field for just 12 snaps, and had a run stuff on the Bengals first series. Carter didn’t get to Joe Burrow for a sack, but he did pressure the Bengals quarterback into a throwaway that hit teammate Nolan Smith in the helmet.', 'Defensive end Bryce Huff started in the four-man front and got a run stop on the first carry. Burrow’s quick throws made it hard for the D-line to get to him, but Smith continued his run of games with sack when he split a second-quarter takedown of Burrow with defensive tackle Milton Williams.', 'Defensive end Brandon Graham stuffed running back Zack Moss for no gain on a crucial third-and-1 stop in the third.', 'Zack Baun and Nakobe Dean led the Eagles with 12 and nine tackles, respectively. They played well for the most part.', 'Baun made a run tackle near the line on the Bengals’ opening drive. A few plays later, he couldn’t get Chase Brown down before he picked up a third-down conversion. He timed a blitz in the third quarter and had a free run at Burrow, who threw incomplete. He was late to cover Moss out of the backfield on a long gain in the third quarter.', 'Dean sniffed out an early screen for a tackle for loss.', 'The Eagles’ cornerbacks deserve their share of praise for holding Ja’Marr Chase to just 54 yards receiving on nine catches. Cooper DeJean continued to flash in the slot. The rookie recorded a huge fourth-down stop when he tackled Chase in the backfield for a loss in the third quarter. He should have caught the Eagles’ third interception of the season, but he dropped a Burrow pass that hit him in the hands. A play later, on third-and-22, DeJean failed to plaster tight end Mike Gesicki during a Burrow scramble that he converted. He wasn’t close to Chase on a 12-yard catch he made out of the slot. DeJean made a good open-field tackle on the next play, though.', 'Darius Slay left in the third quarter with a groin injury. Before that, he broke up a third-down corner fade to receiver Jermaine Burton into the end zone in the second quarter. Burton got him on a go route a drive later, though, that resulted in a 41-yard gain.', 'Quinyon Mitchell did a solid job on Chase in the first half when matched up against the star receiver. And he again had an almost-interception. Mitchell caught the ball this time, but was out of bounds. He got penalized for holding on a pass that Chase still caught for 13 yards in the third. Isaiah Rodgers replaced Slay and he broke up a pass to Chase that was deflected to safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson for an interception. Avonte Maddox was again the sixth defensive back in dime personnel.', 'Gardner-Johnson was Johnny on the spot for his fourth quarterback interception — the Eagles’ first forced turnover in four games. He had his ups and downs in coverage, and was out of his gap responsibility on Chase Brown’s 4-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.', 'Reed Blankenship had some struggles in coverage, specifically with Gesicki. The tight end had a third-down grab vs. him in man coverage on the opening drive. Blankenship did break up a third-down pass to Gesicki in the second quarter. The tight end got him in the fourth quarter on a 12-yard pass play.', 'Jake Elliott kicked 49- and 47-yard field goals and made all his extra points. Gainwell had a 31-yard return to open the second half. The Bengals never punted, so DeJean never had a chance to return. Eagles’ kick-coverage units were otherwise sound.', 'Nick Sirianni’s squad had its best overall game of the season on the road against a decent team with an elite quarterback. In game management, the coach had a good challenge on a Bengals dropped pass that was initially ruled complete.', 'Also, have the Eagles jumped the shark with the Tush Push? There is a time and a place for it, but not every third-and-1 — especially one near midfield — calls for it. It can be too conservative.', 'Kellen Moore dialed up more under-center plays that helped open up play-action. He did well to mix in Hurts runs against a Bengals defense that had previously struggled against the quarterback plus-one game.', 'Vic Fangio’s defense got off to slow start and had some lulls, but overall, it kept Burrow in check and forced two turnovers in one game for the first time this season. Fangio did get outschemed when the Bengals got Chase matched up against Nolan Smith in the end zone.']"

""It didn\'t work out. So that\'s frustrating. I put that on myself. It\'s a situation where I felt like we needed to be aggressive and get a score on that possession, given that we were down seven.

Roob's Observations: Eagles blow out Bengals in Cincinnati,https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/roobs-observations-eagles-blow-out-bengals-cincinnati-jalen-hurts-joe-burrow/626755/,"['Ron Jaworski and Reuben Frank share their instant analysis following the Eagles’ 37-17 win over the Bengals in Week 8. Nick Sirianni, Jalen Hurts and many more Eagles weigh in on the victory.', 'Three straight wins, two straight blowouts, a 5-2 record and the Eagles look like a real football team again.', 'The offense looked tremendous. The defense looked fantastic. And this just may be a fun season after all.', 'The Eagles went into Cincinnati Sunday and earned themselves a commanding 37-17 win over a dangerous Bengals team. It was impressive stuff all around.', 'Here’s our 10 Instant Observations as the Eagles have a three-game winning streak for the first time in almost a year.', '1. This is a win the Eagles have needed for a long time. On the road against an elite quarterback and a quality team with all phases operating at a high level. We didn’t learn much from the Browns and Giants except that the Eagles could beat terrible teams with lousy quarterbacks. This was Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, Trey Hendrickson and a scary matchup that the Eagles absolutely dominated. And despite blowing the home opener vs. the Falcons and despite getting embarrassed by the Bucs the Eagles find themselves at 5-2 with a three-game winning streak, and the conversation about Nick Sirianni might soon be about a contract extension instead of when he’s getting fired. You have to love how the Eagles have bounced back from some early adversity and taken their place among the NFL’s best. And say what you want about Sirianni, he’s exceptional at getting his team prepared, getting them confident and getting them to shrug off whatever adversity hits. Getting them to believe in themselves. And a season that a few weeks ago seemed like it was in disarray now has so much promise. The Eagles are legit. How about that.', '2. Very encouraging stuff from the Eagles’ defense. After the Bengals opened the game with a 17-play, 70-yard touchdown drive, they really did look unstoppable. Joe Burrow was 11-for-12 on the drive for 60 yards with a touchdown pass to Ja’Marr Chase. But one hallmark of Vic Fangio’s defense is that they figure things out along the way, and coverage tightened up, pressure improved and they held Cincinnati to 10 points and just 210 yards. The Bengals were 6-for-6 on third down in the first drive and then 4-for-7 the rest of the way. Adjustments. The Eagles even got two 4th-quarter defenses for the first time in two years – since a win over the Steelers when Chauncey Gardner-Johnson picked off Kenny Pickett and Javon Hargrave forced a Pickett fumble. Over the last three weeks, this defense has held the Browns, Giants and Bengals to 29 points – the first time since early in 2016 they’ve allowed fewer than 30 points over a three-week span. Burrow targeted Chase 11 times and he had 54 yards. That’s huge. Great coverage, great pressure, great tackling. Second half, Burrow didn’t even complete a pass longer than 13 yards. This Bengals offense is dangerous, but their last eight drives netted just 10 points. The Eagles have allowed just 640 net yards in their last three games, their 2nd-lowest total for any three-game span since 1992. In 2017 they allowed 591 in wins over the Broncos, Cowboys and Bears. Also the first time the defense has allowed 29 or fewer points in a three-game span since 2017. That’s elite defense. This is one of the youngest defenses in the league and they’re only going to get better.', ""3. This was the best Jalen Hurts has looked in a long, long time. Probably since the first Dallas game last year. He completed 16 of 20 passes for 236 yards with a 45-yard TD to DeVonta Smith, three rushing TDs and for the fourth straight game no interceptions. He spread the ball around, he made great decisions, he got rid of the ball fast, he just looked super engaged and it seemed like his mind was working quickly. That’s three straight games without a turnover and four straight without an interception. When a quarterback can drive the ball down the field and be aggressive while avoiding turnovers, you’re going to win almost every time. Three games since the bye, Hurts is at 71 percent with four touchdown passes, no interceptions and a 3-0 record. He’s not forcing the ball anymore. He's not rushing things. He looks as comfortable as he has since 2022 and Kellen Moore and Doug Nussmeier have a lot to do with that, but Hurts deserves a ton of credit for cleaning up the flaws in his game and getting back to doing the things he does well."", '', '4. We need to talk about Cooper DeJean. That 4th-and-1 play he made on Ja’Marr Chase was just enormous. This is a 21-year-old kid playing playing in his third-career game on defense in the open field against a guy who’s made the Pro Bowl every year he’s been in the league while averaging over 1,200 yards per season. DeJean diagnosed it perfectly, got to Chase before he could turn upfield and brought him down with a grip on his leg so he couldn’t escape. DeJean has made such an enormous difference since Fangio put him in the slot in place of Avonte Maddox. He’s physical, he’s tough, he’s fast and he’s a sure tackler. He’s around the ball and actually should have had his first interception in the second quarter. This is a rookie who had played eight career snaps on defense before the Browns game, and he’s giving the Eagles next-level play very early in his career. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a personnel change make such an immediate impact. DeJean is a flat-out stud.', '5. I can’t give enough props to Isaiah Rodgers for that 4th-quarter pass breakup that led to Chauncey Gardner-Johnson’s interception. The Eagles led 27-17 with 12 ½ minutes left and the Bengals had a 1st-and-10 near midfield when Burrow threw deep to Chase down the right sideline. Normally, Darius Slay would be defending Chase in that spot, but he had just left the game with a groin injury and Rodgers was out there in his place. After being forced to sit out last year with his gambling suspension, he’d played only 41 snaps on defense all year. But he was ready for the moment and you’ve got to love the way he didn’t back down against one of the best wide receivers in the NFL. Rodgers had great coverage and batted the ball in the air, where Gardner-Johnson was waiting and picked up the Eagles’ first interception since Week 3. It’s a terrific play whoever makes it, but the fact that it was a guy who had just entered the game moments earlier and had played 41 snaps since 2022 makes it even more special.', '6. Some days Saquon Barkley is just going to run all over the other team, and that’s awesome when he does. And then are games like this, where he just chips away, chips away, chips away, the yards don’t come so easily, and eventually he breaks through. You’ve got to give it to Kellen Moore for continuing to feed Barkley on those days when the yards aren’t coming so easily. He’s so freaking talented that just about every time it’s going to pay off. Through three quarters, Barkley had 15 carries for 51 yards for 3.4 yards per carry. Final drive in the fourth quarter? Seven carries for 57 yards. Barkley is so big and tough and powerful that he just wears down defenders. It seems like as the game goes on he gets stronger and stronger and by the fourth quarter he’s just steamrolling people. Barkley finished with 108 rushing yards despite the slow start and now has 766 rushing yards in just seven games, which is insane. He’s a beast.', '7. Grant Calcaterra is really developing into quite a weapon in the receiving game, and he’s not much of a blocker – although the effort is certainly there -  but he is fast and has soft hands and clearly has the trust of Hurts, who he spent a year with at Oklahoma in 2019. Calcaterra had 19- and 28-yard catches Sunday and with Dallas Goedert out since very early in the Browns game, he has seven catches for 130 the last three weeks, which is big-time production. This from a guy averaging 5.2 yards per game in his career going into the Cleveland game. Calcaterra only has 11 receptions this year, but that includes catches of 15, 19, 20, 26 and 34 yards. You’re always going to miss a guy like Goedert, who’s an elite blocker and a big-time receiver. But Calcaterra has really helped make up for his absence with a bunch of big plays. I’d like to see a role for him once Goedert does get back.', '8. How about that Nolan Smith? Dude really looks like a football player lately. Smith had one sack in his first 21 career games and now has one in each of the Eagles’ wins on this three-game winning streak. The 23-year-old Smith is the Eagles’ youngest player with a sack in three straight games since Trent Cole in 2006, and it’s so encouraging to see this kind of production from a guy who a lot of people had some doubts about not too long ago. And understandably. He was the 30th pick in last year’s draft and the production just wasn’t there. But he stayed positive throughout that first year and a half and something clicked for him over the last month. He never stopped putting in the work, never got down on himself, kept learning from Brandon Graham and Josh Sweat – and Haason Reddick last year - and it’s all paying off. And it’s not just the sacks. Smith plays hard all the time and he’s quick enough that he can hang in there in coverage as well.  Smith’s emergence as a legit edge rusher has been a very encouraging product of this winning streak.', '9. The Eagles beat the Giants by 25 points and the Bengals by 20. How rare is it to go on the road back-to-back weeks and win by 17 or more points? Oh yeah, it’s rare. Last time the Eagles won consecutive weeks by 17 or more points was 1966, when Norm Snead and Co. beat the Steelers at old Pitt Stadium 31-14 and then beat the Giants 31-3 at Yankee Stadium. That was 58 years ago. The only other time it happened was in November of 1947 when they beat Washington 38-14 at Griffith Stadium and then the Giants 41-24 at the Polo Grounds. Three times in 92 years. It’s not easy to win on the road and it’s not easy to go on the road five of your first seven games and go 4-1 but to win by a combined 42 points in consecutive starts shows a team that’s really locked in and truly resilient.', '10. Can’t finish this without acknowledging the job Fred Johnson did at left tackle against Trey Hendrickson. There aren’t many more dangerous pass rushers than Hendrickson, whose 60 sacks since 2020 are 3rd-most in the league and who already has 7.0 sacks this year. Johnson is considered a very good run blocker but he’s been uneven as a pass blocker. But he was lights out Sunday, holding his former Bengals teammate to no sacks, no hurries, no quarterback hits and no tackles for loss. It’s remarkable how well Jeff Stoutland gets his backups prepared, and Johnson’s ability to neutralize Hendrickson gave Hurts the time he needed on his blind side to get the ball exactly where he wanted and when he wanted. Jordan Mailata will be out at least two more games and you’ve got to feel a lot more confident with Big Fred after this performance. Mailata is as good as any left tackle in the business, but the Eagles’ ability  to operate the offense at peak efficiency without him speaks volumes about Johnson’s ability to hang in there and play at a high level.', 'Subscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts: \nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube', 'Never miss a moment.

He was quickly tackled, leading to a hole the Bengals simply couldn’t climb out of.', 'Most fans question not only the idea of of going for it in the third quarter but also the play call that left a lot to be desired. Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase had this to say about the play following the game.', '“Just one call I wish we could’ve took back and changed to something else,” Chase said following the game. “But we called it, and it happened. I don’t mind being aggressive, just they were on it.”', 'Chase has been known to take screens for more than it looks like they should go for. He is usually able to make the first man miss regularly. However, for such a point in the game, to simply rely on that in that situation is absurd, especially when you think about the play that Chase scored on in the first quarter, where they were able to get him isolated against an EDGE in the end zone.', 'It is clear there is some imagination to this offense, but more times than not it amounts to hoping Joe Burrow or Chase can just make something out of nothing.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

Eagles WR was thinking this before making several big plays in win over Bengals,https://www.nj.com/eagles/2024/10/eagles-wr-was-thinking-this-before-making-several-big-plays-in-win-over-bengals.html,"[""Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith reacts after catching a 45-yard touchdown pass in Sunday's 37-17 win against the Cincinnati Bengals.(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)"", 'CINCINNATI — When Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith got up from the Paycor Stadium field after being tackled by Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Mike Hilton on his first catch of the day, the play resulted in a two-yard loss. Smith began to have a horrible flashback, hoping he wasn’t about to have a day like he had last week against the Giants when he finished the game with the exact same stat line.', '“We’re not doing this today,” Smith recalled thinking as he walked back to the huddle.', 'Smith’s determination proved true, and he became an important part of the offense once again. His six catches for 85 yards and a touchdown helped the Eagles defeat the Bengals 37-17, marking their first win ever in Cincinnati and the team’s third victory in a row. Smith said he knew he had to stay patient and be ready after that first catch.', '“I trusted my training,” Smith explained. “I go out there every day. I feel like I’ve been working hard at my craft, so just being ready when the opportunity comes. Sometimes, it might not come right then, but when it does, you have to be ready.”', 'Smith said he and wide receiver A.J. Brown knew they’d have chances to make plays if given the opportunity because the Bengals played a lot of one-on-one coverages. Smith took advantage of that, especially in the middle of the field on crossing and slant routes.', 'BUY EAGLES TICKETS: STUBHUB, VIVID SEATS, TICKETMASTER', 'Smith also had a one-handed, 41-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter that gave the Eagles a 24-17 lead. He credited quarterback Jalen Hurts for trusting him to make the downfield play. Hurts said he knew Smith would step up Sunday, even though he wasn’t targeted much last week.', '“I don’t think that’s all on DeVonta,” Hurts said. “We have a lot of talent and a lot of mouths to feed. That’s something we have to navigate as a team, but the one thing I’m confident in is everyone being ready when their opportunity and number are called. He made some huge plays downfield and on third downs. It was a great showing for him, our offense, and our team.”', 'Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said he expected Smith to bounce back and have a big game, given his track record.', '“He made clutch catches,” Sirianni said. “It’s not a surprise because the last time he was shut out, he caught eight passes for 176 yards. That’s the way the game goes, and that’s why you can’t overreact when things happen. I’m proud of him and what he stands for—the way he puts his head down and works and tunes out everything else.”', 'Smith has a chance to have another big performance next Sunday afternoon when the Eagles face the Jacksonville Jaguars. Before Week 8, the Jaguars ranked 31st in pass defense, allowing 273.9 yards per game. With Smith, Brown, and potentially tight end Dallas Goedert if he recovers from his hamstring injury, the passing game could help the team get its fourth win in a row.', 'Thank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

Over their first seven games, this is what the Eagles opening drives have amounted to:', 'Packers: 3 plays, minus-5 yards INT', 'Falcons: 4 plays, 24 yards Punt (crossed midfield)', 'Saints: 3 plays, minus-9 yards Punt', 'Bucs: 3 plays, 7 yards Punt', 'Browns: 3 plays, 5 yards Punt', 'Giants: 4 plays, 17 yards Punt', 'Bengals: 10 plays, 55 yards, Elliott 39-yard FG', 'Total: 30 plays, 94 yards, 5 Punts, 6 first downs, 1 FG, 1 INT', 'Linebacker Nakobe Dean’s nice open field tackle on Chase Brown for a three-yard loss to the Bengals’ fourth play of the game, back at the Cincinnati 43 for a second-and-13. Dean read the screen very well, sitting there and nailing Brown as soon as he caught the ball.', 'Defensive end Milton Williams, normally very reliable, getting rolled out right by left tackle Cody Ford on Chase Brown’s game-tying 17-17 four-yard touchdown run up the middle with 4:16 left in the third quarter.', 'Rookie cornerback Quinyon Mitchell received an education against one of the best—Chase. Mitchell found himself running after Chase all afternoon, including a Chase 13-yard reception on a first-and-10 at the Eagles’ 36 in which Mitchell even tried holding Chase and was flagged for it.', 'Smith’s false start at the Bengals’ 24 on the Eagles’ last drive of the half. Not smart football when there was no intention to run a play just before the two-minute warning.', 'With 5:08 left in the first half, the Bengals had run off 34 plays to the Eagles’ 17. At the time, that was no way to keep someone like Joe Burrow off the field.', 'Cornerback Darius Slay getting beat by rookie Jermaine Burton for a 41-yard reception on the Bengals’ third possession. The Eagles were fortunate to have Evan McPherson 54-yard field goal attempt slide wide left with 5:08 left in the half.', 'Dean failing to pick up Chase right next to him on a third-and-eight at the Bengals’ 48 on Cincinnati’s open drive, just two plays after Dean made a fine open-field tackle for a three-yard loss.', 'Nick Sirianni still acting like “Sideshow Nick,” after the Eagles picked up their second turnover of the game when Dean fell on Gesicki’s late-fourth quarter fumble. Sirianni could not refrain from acting like a normal NFL coach. Instead, he had to leap onto the field, ripping his headset off and prance around like a fan in the stands who happens to be an NFL coach. Somewhere Vince Lombardi was rolling over in his grave.', 'After coming in and playing well against the Giants, right guard Tyler Steen had himself a half. He was called for a holding penalty on the last play of the first quarter, wiping out a Hurts’ nine-yard run to the Bengals’ nine. But this was egregious: After Hurts hit Smith for an 11-yard reception at the Bengals’ 18 with 1:44 left in the half, Steen had to pile into Cincinnati safety Geno Stone for an unnecessary roughness call, moving the ball back to the Bengals’ 33 and forcing the Eagles into a third-and-16 on their last drive of the half.', 'The Eagles’ giving up a third-and-22 on Cincinnati’s second drive. It looked like they had Burrow pinned down for a loss. He somehow squeezed free to find Gesicki down field for 24 yards and a first down. Josh Sweat came up through the middle on a stunt and missed Burrow. Bryce Huff was where he has been most of the season, behind someone being blocked, and Gesicki was left wide open. The play put the ball at the Eagles’ 30 and set up an Evan McPherson 27-yard field goal and a 10-3 Cincinnati lead with 9:32 left in the half.', 'Steen’s holding call that wiped out Hurts’ nine-yard run on the Eagles’ first drive. The flag came on a second-and-12 at the Bengals’ 18 and it marked the last play of the first quarter—without the Eagles still shutout in the opening quarter.', 'Again, the 2024 Eagles failure to score in the first quarter. They remain the only team in the NFL to not score a point in the first quarter. It marks the first time in Eagles’ history that they have not scored a point in the opening quarter in their first seven games. They have now been outscored 30-0 in the first quarter this season, and outgained, 488 yards to 381.', 'The Eagles’ defense on Cincinnati’s first drive. The Eagles allowed Burrow to complete 11 of 12 for 60 yards and a touchdown. The Bengals were five-for-five on third down, including converting a third-and-eight, and two third-and-sixes. Burrow was five-for-five on third down. He got the ball out fast and proved quickly he was not Daniel Jones or Deshaun Watson. He completed passes to four different receivers. The drive was impressive. It covered 70 yards over 17 plays and chewed up an incredible 10 minutes, 4 seconds off the clock. The 10-minute, 4-second drive was the longest opening drive in the NFL this season. The Eagles did not receive the ball until there was 4:56 left in the first quarter. The drive was capped when Burrow directed Chase through traffic in between Nolan Smith and Reed Blankenship. Chase was only the most dangerous threat on the field—and somehow Blankenship and Smith lost him. On their opening drive, the Bengals almost accomplished what the Browns and Giants did for an entire game. Entering the game, the Eagles had held the Browns and Giants, two teams that had a combined record of 3-11, to an average of 9.5 points, 181.5 yards and 3.4 yards per play. The Bengals had 7 points, and 70 yards on their first series.', 'Joseph Santoliquito is a hall of fame, award-winning sportswriter based in the Philadelphia area who has written feature stories for SI.com, ESPN.com, NFL.com, MLB.com, Deadspin and The Philadelphia Inquirer/Daily News.

Sunday against the Bengals was his best all-around game of the season.', '""I did look at this game as a really good test,"" Didinger said. ""Not that I thought that the Cincinnati defense was that great, but there was a lot at stake here and Hurts came out and was just terrific. His numbers were really good, obviously, but beyond that it was just the way he looked. The only way I could put it, he was so in command with everything that was happening out there...He was just in complete command. He was just on point with his throws, his timing was great, he was very comfortable in the pocket, he moved when he had to move, he didn\'t look skittish. He wasn\'t trying to force anything. He just kind of let it come to him. Anytime he wanted to get the ball to [A.J.] Brown or [DeVonta] Smith he did...He never put the ball in harms way.""', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

""We crossed paths in college,"" Hurts said when asked how far back he goes with Burrow.', 'Sure, they crossed paths when Hurts lost out to Burrow for the Heisman Trophy in 2019. And again when Hurts and his Oklahoma teammates got trounced by Burrow and LSU 63-28 in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Burrow threw for nearly 500 yards to go along with 7 touchdowns that day, and Hurts ... did not.', 'And they crossed paths in a metaphorical sense in the 2020 draft. Burrow went No. 1 overall. Hurts was taken 52 picks later by the Eagles as a backup to Carson Wentz, as mostly a gadget QB until Wentz self-destructed.', ""Well, look at Hurts now after he led the Eagles' 37-17 demolition over Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday."", 'Hurts was asked what it felt like to outperform Burrow.', '""That’s the league,\' Hurts said. ""That\'s the league. I have standards for myself as well.""', 'All of that is not to say that Hurts was consumed by Burrow for the last five years, waiting for the chance to get even with Burrow in the NFL. After all, both QBs led their teams to a Super Bowl, and both signed contract extensions worth more than half a billion dollars combined.', 'But it does provide a window into what makes Hurts great. He might not have been the No. 1 pick, but he clearly thinks he should have been.', 'Hurts let everyone see that Sunday. He completed 16 of 20 passes for 236 yards and a touchdown. He had a passer rating of 132.5, the third straight game when his rating exceeded 119.', ""Hurts also rushed for 3 touchdowns, and most impressively, Hurts didn't turn the ball over for the third straight game. Needless to say, the Eagles have won all three games, averaging 28.3 points per game."", 'You would be hard-pressed to find a better three-game stretch by Hurts since the 2022 Super Bowl season.', 'It was a far cry from the start of the season when Hurts threw 4 interceptions and lost 3 fumbles as the Eagles started 2-2.', '""Jalen puts the work in,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""That\'s something that doesn\'t get talked about enough for Jalen Hurts − how much he loves football, and how much time he puts into this game.', '""And so we were able to look at some of the things that we were inefficient on (during the bye week), some of the things that we were good on, and, you know, he just put so much work into it.""', ""It was a turbulent offseason for Hurts and Sirianni. There was speculation after last season's 1-6 collapse that Sirianni might be fired, amid tepid support from Hurts. As it was, Sirianni ceded control of the offense to Kellen Moore."", 'And then Hurts struggled with turnovers.', '""You’re bound to turn the ball over and things like that when you’re not executing,"" wide receiver DeVonta Smith said when asked about Hurts\' turnaround.

But after six games, Vic Fangio’s defense had a grand total of two forced turnovers all season. Two.', '“We’ve got to get off the schneid there and get some takeaways,” Fangio said this week. “We really do.”', 'It finally happened on Sunday in the Eagles’ dominant 37-17 win over the Bengals in Cincinnati. The Eagles doubled up their season total.', 'The Eagles had two takeaways in a game for the first time since last November. And under Nick Sirianni, the Eagles are now 14-2 in games where they take the ball away at least twice.', '“They come in bulk,” said C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who had a fourth-quarter interception. “Once one comes, they all start rolling. It’s a long season so it’s one of many for everybody. Punch-outs, interceptions, whatever it may be.”', 'Gardner-Johnson’s interception at the 12:21 mark of the fourth quarter was a huge play. The Eagles were up 10 at that point but the game was still in reach for the Bengals when Joe Burrow heaved up a deep ball to Pro Bowler Ja’Marr Chase down the ride sideline.', '', 'Not long before that play, veteran Darius Slay left with a groin injury so Burrow went after Slay’s replacement, Isaiah Rodgers.', 'Rodgers knew the Bengals were going to go after him and he was ready.', 'In 1-on-1 coverage against one of the best receivers in the NFL, Rodgers made an incredible play, batting the pass into the waiting hands of Gardner-Johnson.', '“It’s a hell of a play by Zay,” Gardner-Johnson said. “Hell of a play by Zay. To be honest with you, he’s a great receiver, great matchup. I just had faith in my guy. I just knew that if he wasn’t going to get it, nobody was going to get it or we gonna get it.”', 'Rodgers said he initially tried to reel in the interception with one hand but when he realized he couldn’t, he tipped the ball purposely to his teammate.', 'While he didn’t even see Gardner-Johnson the whole way, Rodgers knew CJGJ was supposed to be over the top and he trusted that he would be. It was an impressive play by both to pull off the unlikely interception. ', '“It’s something you practice,” Rodgers said. “You feel like as a DB if you can’t get two hands on the ball, it might be hard to pick it off with one hand, especially going at that angle I was at. We practice tips and overthrows. That’s one thing we preach in our room.”', 'Before this game, the Eagles’ only two takeaways all season were interceptions by Reed Blankenship. He had one in the opener against the Packers in Brazil and he had one in New Orleans to seal the win over the Saints.', 'But by Sunday afternoon, he was no long the only Eagle with a pick this season.', '“You’re rubbing it in my face now, ain’t you?” Blankenship said with a giant smile. “I knew [Gardner-Johnson] was going to get one eventually or somebody was going to get one eventually. We work too hard during the week. Isaiah stepping in for Slay, that’s huge. It’s that next-man-up mentality. We don’t care who it is. If their number’s called, they’re ready to go.”', 'Turnover margin is a big deal for Sirianni and this game puts the Eagles at -4 on the season. That’s not where they want to be but it’s worth noting that Sunday was the Eagles’ third straight game not turning it over on offense.', 'If they can start to get some takeaways on defense, it could be huge.', 'After the Gardner-Johnson interception, the Eagles were able to march 85 yards down the field to score a touchdown to put the game out of reach. And on the very next Bengals drive, the Eagles got the ball back again.', 'This time, Zack Baun was able to punch it out of the hands of tight end Mike Gesicki and Nakobe Dean was able to recover it. The Eagles kicked a field goal on the ensuing drive to get to 37 points.', '“That’s big,” Dean said. “Because we’ve been harping on takeaways. We’ve been harping on takeaways. Turnover drills, punching the ball out, getting interceptions. We’ve been harping on it. For us to get a forced fumble, it was definitely big when Zack got the forced fumble punch-out. It’s something we worked on in the linebacker room like crazy. We’ve been trying to see who was going to get the first one. ', '“For him to punch the ball out, I was excited. I picked up the ball, went to go celebrate. I ran back to the sideline and I wasn’t giving it to nobody but him.
