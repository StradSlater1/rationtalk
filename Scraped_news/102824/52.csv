The injury looked bad, but we learned on Sunday that Ohtani is likely going to be able to play in Game 3.', '“If he feels good enough to go,” manager Dave Roberts told reporters, “I see no reason he won’t be in there.”', 'Even if he does play, it remains to be seen if Ohtani is at the full extent of his capabilities. But with or without his booming bat, the Dodgers are in a great position in this Series. Both games at Dodger Stadium came down to a bases-loaded situation, and they both ended with an L.A. victory. Now, the Dodgers are just two wins away from their second World Series title in the last five years and their first in a full season since 1988.', 'The Yankees, meanwhile, aren’t sweating an injury when it comes to Judge, but they’d sure feel better about their chances of mounting a rally in this Series if his booming bat would come into play.', 'Through two games against the Dodgers, Judge is 1-for-9 with six strikeouts. For the postseason as a whole, he’s 6-for-40 with 19 strikeouts. It’s a far cry from a regular season in which Judge’s 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 1.159 OPS made for one of the best performances by a right-handed hitter in history.', '“I’ve definitely got to step up, and I’ve got to do my job,” Judge said. “Guys around me are doing their jobs, getting on base, and I’m failing at backing them up. We’ve got to turn it around in Game 3.”', 'The Yankees are up against it now. Only 15 teams in 92 tries have won a best-of-seven postseason series in which they dropped the first two games. And so, as their Game 3 starter Clarke Schmidt takes the ball opposite the Dodgers’ Walker Buehler, they’re going to need to feed off the energy of a hungry crowd that hasn’t seen a World Series home game in the Bronx since the Yanks’ 2009 title run.', '“It’ll be a great atmosphere,” slugger Giancarlo Stanton said. “They’ll bring the noise. They understand what’s at stake right now.”', 'When is the game and how can I watch it?\nGame 3 of the World Series will be played at Yankee Stadium in New York on Monday at 8:08 p.m. ET/5:08 p.m. PT. All World Series games will start at the same time and be televised on FOX.', 'All games are available in the U.S. on MLB.TV (authentication to a participating Pay TV provider is required). Live games are also available in select countries outside the U.S. For full details, click here.', 'Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.', 'Who are the starting pitchers?\nDodgers: RHP Walker Buehler (1-6, 5.38 ERA in the regular season)\nBuehler’s regular season didn’t go as expected once he returned from a second Tommy John surgery, but the right-hander has had a strong postseason for the Dodgers. Buehler’s final line against the Padres in NLDS Game 3 looks worse than his overall performance. He then bounced back in a pivotal Game 3 in the NLCS, tossing four scoreless innings against the Mets.', 'The right-hander has always been a strong postseason performer, and his next challenge will be the biggest: Help the Dodgers take an even more commanding series lead in the Bronx.', 'Yankees: RHP Clarke Schmidt (5-5, 2.85 ERA in the regular season)\nSchmidt will make his third career postseason start and his first in the World Series. He tossed 4 2/3 innings of two-run ball in each of his first two outings this October, taking no-decisions against the Royals and Guardians. Schmidt pitched to a 4.50 ERA in eight home starts during the regular season, compared to a 1.39 ERA in eight road outings.', 'What are the starting lineups?\nDodgers: For now, we’ll assume Ohtani will be available for the Dodgers in the leadoff spot. If he’s unable to play, Los Angeles could have Freddie Freeman slide into the designated hitter role, allowing the Dodgers to play Andy Pages or Miguel Rojas.', 'Yankees: Chances are that the Yankees will trot out the same lineup from the first two games of the World Series. Though Judge has struggled throughout the postseason, Yankees manager Aaron Boone flatly rejected a suggestion of moving him in the lineup during the games in Los Angeles.', 'How will the bullpens line up after the starter?\nDodgers: Anthony Banda, Alex Vesia, Michael Kopech and Blake Treinen pitched in both games and could be somewhat limited heading into Game 3. Having the off-day does help, but the Dodgers will need to be mindful of the fact that they have a bullpen game lined up for Tuesday’s Game 4. But if the Dodgers take an early lead and have an opportunity to win a third game in the series, Roberts will be aggressive with his high-leverage relievers.', 'Yankees: The Yankees had to backfill Game 2 after Carlos Rodón registered only 10 outs. Jake Cousins (21 pitches), Tim Hill (14 pitches), Clay Holmes (23 pitches), and Mark Leiter Jr. (9 pitches) were all used, but an off-day between games helps. Cousins and Holmes also pitched in Game 1.', ""Any injuries of note?\nDodgers: There’s no bigger injury concern in the sport than Ohtani and his left shoulder situation, but as of right now, it sounds like he'll be in the lineup for Game 3."", 'Yankees: Rizzo is playing through two fractured fingers on his right hand, which is a pain tolerance issue, as the fractures won’t heal until the offseason. Infielder DJ LeMahieu (right hip impingement) has been continuing to hit and field throughout the playoffs.', 'Who is hot and who is not?\nDodgers: Edman continues his hot hitting, following up a two-hit Game 1 with a solo homer and a double in Game 2. Freeman has also homered in back-to-back games, extending his World Series home run streak to four games.', 'Yankees: Juan Soto homered and had two hits in Game 2. Of his four homers this postseason, three have given the Yankees the lead, and one has tied the game. Stanton has six homers and 14 RBIs this postseason. Rizzo has produced a .520 on-base percentage. Judge continues to slump, now 6-for-40 (.150) with 19 strikeouts during this postseason. Jazz Chisholm Jr. (.186 BA) and Austin Wells (.098 BA) also have struggled.', ""Anything else fans might want to know?\n• There's a lot to know just about Game 2! Catch up on all the amazing factoids here, and look back at all the fun facts from Game 1 here."", '• The Yankees have won eight of the previous 11 World Series meetings between the clubs (1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1977, 1978). The Dodgers were victorious three times (1955, 1963, 1981).', ""• The Dodgers and Yankees had a World Series preview June 7-9 at Yankee Stadium, with Los Angeles winning two of the three games. Teoscar Hernández had a go-ahead, two-run double in the 11th inning of the first game, a 2-1 Dodgers win, then hit two homers in an 11-3 rout the next night. The Yanks salvaged the finale with a 6-4 win, powered by Trent Grisham's three-run homer off Tyler Glasnow."", 'Anthony Castrovince has been a reporter for MLB.com since 2004.', 'Senior Reporter Bryan Hoch has covered the Yankees for MLB.com since 2007.

', 'Despite a quick response from New York, when star outfielder Juan Soto made Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto pay for leaving a fast ball on the inner half of the plate with his massive homer to right field, the Boys in Blue answered right back, tacking on three more runs in the bottom of the third inning thanks to back-to-back homers from Teoscar Hernández and Game 1 star Freddie Freeman.', 'The additional run support pushed the Dodgers to a 4-1 lead, which is all Yamamoto needed on Saturday.', ""Read more: How many times have the Dodgers won the World Series? Looking at all of Los Angeles' past wins"", 'The rookie sensation, who signed a monster contract with the Dodgers prior to the season, tossed 6 and 1/3 innings of one-hit baseball against the Yankees while striking out four batters and walking two. He walked off the field to a standing ovation from the Dodger faithful after wowing in his first ever World Series start. ', ""Fellow Japanese star Shohei Ohtani was quiet in Game 2, going 0-for-3 with one walk and one strikeout.

""If it\'s a pain-tolerance situation, I just don\'t see him not playing Game 3.""', ""Ohtani suffered what was described as a subluxation while sliding into second base to end the seventh inning of Saturday's 4-2 win over the New York Yankees in Game 2. Ohtani was slow to get up, rolling on the ground while grabbing his left arm. When he was finally helped to his feet, Dodgers assistant athletic trainer Yosuke Nakajima held the superstar's left arm as the two disappeared into the clubhouse."", ""Ohtani subsequently underwent strength and range-of-motion tests that came back positive, iced his shoulder and left Dodger Stadium without a sleeve. He underwent an MRI in L.A. on Sunday morning, details of which have not been provided by the team. Ohtani's flight was expected to touch down in New York sometime early Sunday evening, after which he was expected to join his teammates for a workout that would include more treatment and light batting practice."", 'Roberts said Ohtani\'s swings off a tee and in the batting cage would be ""telling.""', '""I think that he\'s obviously very well aware of himself and his body,"" Roberts added. ""So if he feels good enough to go, then I see no reason why he wouldn\'t be in there.""', ""Roberts acknowledged that Ohtani might have to tolerate playing through discomfort. What helps, Roberts added, is that it's an injury to his back shoulder, not his front shoulder, which would have been more problematic while swinging as a left-handed hitter."", ""Ohtani didn't spend any time on the injured list this year and put together a historic regular season, becoming the first member of the 50/50 club and all but guaranteeing he'll be the first full-time designated hitter to win an MVP. Through 13 games of his first postseason, Ohtani is slashing .260/.403/.460 with three home runs and 10 RBIs but no stolen bases, having been caught twice."", ""The Dodgers will face right-hander Clarke Schmidt in Game 3. If Ohtani can't start, Freddie Freeman, dealing with injuries all month, would probably slot in at DH. Max Muncy would then shift to first base, Enrique Hernandez would start at third base and Andy Pages would be inserted into the lineup to handle center field. Ohtani's replacement in the leadoff spot would be Mookie Betts."", 'Asked if he\'s worried about Ohtani performing below 100%, Roberts said: ""That doesn\'t concern me.

Ohtani rolled around on the ground while grabbing his left arm before heading to the clubhouse.', ""The injury came on a night that Yoshinobu Yamamoto -- who hadn't pitched in a seventh inning of a game since June 7 -- needed only 86 pitches to blanket the Yankees over 6⅓ innings and it looked as if he could have kept going. He used a five-pitch mix to get it done, including striking out Aaron Judge twice -- once on a slider and once on a split finger. He gave up only one hit, two walks and struck out four. His only blemish was a third-inning home run by Juan Soto."", 'Yamamoto is looking stronger in this postseason after returning from an arm injury in September. It helped that his offense immediately gave him the lead back after the Soto home run as first baseman Freddie Freeman incurred multiple standing ovations -- both before homering in the third inning of Game 2 and in response to his Game 1 winner.', 'Teoscar Hernandez also went deep -- a two-run shot right before Freeman -- as did Tommy Edman in the second inning, giving the Dodgers their second-most home runs (24) in a single postseason in franchise history. The win gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead with the series shifting to New York for Game 3 on Monday. -- Jesse Rogers', ""Yankees: The Yankees aren't going to win the World Series with this version of Aaron Judge."", ""The presumptive American League MVP went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts Saturday. He's 1-for-9 with six strikeouts in the World Series, and 6-for-40 (.150) with 19 strikeouts in the postseason. The Yankees have advanced this far without Judge supplying anything close to the production he provided during the regular season. The Yankees don't necessarily need that version of Judge to resurface to win the World Series. But they will not beat the Dodgers four times in five games if Judge isn't substantially better. Giancarlo Stanton belted a huge home run in Game 1. Juan Soto delivered the Yankees' first two hits, including a home run, in Game 2. Judge, the third member of the Yankees' slugging trio, needs to contribute in New York. -- Jorge Castillo"", 'The big question for Game 3: As the Dodgers celebrated taking the first two games of the World Series, they did so with a question in the back of their minds: Will they have Ohtani at full strength for the rest of the series? Ohtani, who was caught stealing in the seventh inning, was helped off the field by training staff. An on-field microphone caught him saying his left shoulder was injured. After the game, Roberts said that it was a shoulder subluxation and the Dodgers were ""encouraged"" by the initial results before further testing.', 'Ohtani, the soon-to-be National League MVP, went 0-for-3 with a walk Saturday night. He is 1-for-8 in the series. And while the Dodgers are deep enough to replace him with Mookie Betts or Tommy Edman atop the lineup and with any number of bats at designated hitter, Ohtani is their best player, and losing him would be an enormous gut punch. In a follow-up postgame question about how the Dodgers would adjust without Ohtani, Roberts said ""I\'m expecting him to be there."" Regardless, the excitement of taking a 2-0 series lead was tempered by the specter of losing Ohtani for any period of time. -- Jeff Passan', '', '', '', '']"

There were fears the Japanese star’s season could be over, but on Sunday Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told ESPN that Ohtani will be available for Monday’s Game 3 at Yankee Stadium.', '“He’s in a great spot. He’s playing tomorrow,” Roberts told ESPN’s Karl Ravech.', 'Ohtani had a brilliant regular season, becoming the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season. He has had a good but not outstanding postseason so far by his lofty standards, with a .863 OPS, below his regular season career average of .945. He is 1 for 8 in the first two games of the World Series. Ohtani had been one of the few players on the Dodgers roster who got through the season without a major injury.

So much, in fact, that manager Dave Roberts said the expectation is for the superstar designated hitter to be in the Dodgers’ lineup for Game 3 on Monday night at Yankee Stadium.', '“He still has to go through the workout and swing the bat,” Roberts said before the Dodgers’ workout on Sunday at Yankee Stadium. “But today feels better than yesterday, and our assumption is tomorrow’s going to feel better than today. So with that, that’s what I’m banking on.”', 'Ohtani suffered the shoulder subluxation, which is partial dislocation, when he landed awkwardly on his left arm during a stolen-base attempt that ended the seventh inning of the Dodgers’ 4-2 win in Game 2. He immediately signaled for a timeout to the second-base umpire and walked off the field with the training staff while holding his left arm gingerly.', 'Ohtani underwent further testing on Sunday, but Roberts said he didn’t have the exact diagnosis. Ohtani, who flew separately from the team on Sunday, did not participate in the team’s workout during the two-hour window on the field but was seen entering the stadium at around 7:30 p.m. ET.', 'Roberts had noted that Ohtani would go through baseball activity -- swings off the tee, then batting practice.', '“I think that taking dry swings, which he’s done, then obviously taking balls off the tee, batting practice in the cage, that’s going to be telling,” Roberts said. “I think that he’s obviously very well aware of himself and his body.

So I guess you could put it in the Freddie [Freeman] bucket. But guys have had this before and played. But, again, it's just everyone's tolerance.”"", 'One positive, the Dodgers believe, is that Ohtani’s swing shouldn’t be affected too much with the injury.

Ohtani walked off the field with a trainer who held his left arm with care.', 'But initial strength and mobility tests suggested the injury was not as serious as originally feared; team medical staff diagnosed Ohtani with a subluxation — a partial displacement of the joint — and not a more troublesome dislocation.

Los Angeles’s opponents have centered their pitching plans and bullpen management around him.', '“Any time you have probably the best baseball player in the world, I think it’s going to help and frees up some of the other guys to kind of play with a little less pressure or a little more freedom,” Game 3 Dodgers starter Walker Buehler said.', 'And during a season of widespread injury pain for the Dodgers, Ohtani has been a constant, calming presence.

Slide Freddie Freeman to DH', ""There's no good news for the Dodgers if Ohtani is out. But Freeman is clearly compromised, as he plays through a sprained right ankle he sustained late last month."", 'The time off prior to the World Series clearly did Freeman a world of good.

Still, putting Muncy at first would allow the Dodgers to reshuffle and prioritize their defense."", ""In the meantime, with Ohtani's lefty bat out of the lineup, Muncy would almost certainly need to be elevated.

Ohtani walked off the field favoring his left shoulder.', 'The mood in the Dodger dugout instantly changed.', '“Not only in the dugout, but the whole stadium went silent,” said Teoscar Hernandez, whose third-inning home run ahead of Freddie Freeman gave the Dodgers enough runs to win the game. “To know how big Shohei has been for us. Hopefully he will be OK.”', 'Ohtani suffered a subluxation of the shoulder, manager Dave Roberts said, meaning in layman’s terms that he had a partial dislocation of that joint.', '', 'Roberts said Ohtani will have an MRI Sunday during the off day before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium Monday night.

So we’re encouraged. I don’t want to speculate because we don’t have the scans yet. We’ll know more once we get them. But I take that as a positive.”', 'The Dodgers left immediately after the game to fly to New York.

Ohtani signed for 10 years at $700 million with $680 million deferred. He had played his first six seasons in the U.S. for the Los Angeles Angels. The other was pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who came directly from Japan, signing a 12-year, $325 million deal.', 'Both players were a big part of the story Saturday night. Yamamoto pitched into the seventh inning, holding the Yankees to a run on a single hit, a Juan Soto homer with two out in the third inning. He retired the final 11 hitters he faced before Roberts pulled him with one out in the top of the seventh after Giancarlo Stanton popped to second base.', 'It was his longest outing since pitching seven innings on June 7 in a 3-1 win over the Yankees in New York. In his next start against Kansas City, he left with a sore right shoulder and didn’t return until Sept. 10. The Dodgers have been building him back up ever since.', '“He hadn’t been this effective since the first Yankee game,” Roberts said. “I felt like this was a good building block game. He threw 87 pitches. We had a good foundation. I really wanted him to get Stanton, get one more hitter and touch that seventh inning.”', 'It was all good feelings and cheer going into the bottom of the seventh, the Dodgers leading, 4-1. Yanks reliever Clay Holmes struck out Miguel Rojas to open the inning and then walked Ohtani, who inexplicably tried to steal second on the first pitch to Mookie Betts.', '', 'Ohtani, the first 50/50 player in MLB history during the regular season with 54 homers and 59 stolen bases, hasn’t swiped a base during the postseason.

Your Privacy,https://www.si.com/mlb/yoshinobu-yamamoto-dazzles-dodgers-bullpen-world-series-debut,"['Los Angeles Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto gave his team a gift on Saturday. He carried a one-hit game into the seventh inning of a World Series outing against the New York Yankees. And while the opening part of that sentence was nice—of course—it was the clause that followed that might ultimately prove to be the most important. This was one of the best games that Yamamoto has pitched in his first year in MLB. But its greatest value may come from its length.', 'The Dodgers are in an enviable position. They now sit up 2–0 in the World Series over the Yankees after Saturday’s 4–2 win. But there are still pockets of this roster worthy of concern. This rotation could generously be described as threadbare: The only place to look for a full starting five around here is on the injured list. Los Angeles has navigated the playoffs thus far with just three starting pitchers, two of whom missed significant time with injuries this year themselves, making it difficult to rely on them for any serious length. The Dodgers’ top relievers have admirably carried the resulting load, including navigating bullpen games in every round, even in critical situations. But that weight accumulates. Yet they collectively got a critical opportunity for breathing room with Yamamoto’s outing Sunday.', 'It was just the second time in 13 playoff games this year that a Dodgers starter pitched into the seventh. ', '“Obviously, the bullpen is going to be leaned on a lot during this series,” said Dodgers reliever Michael Kopech, who pitched the eighth inning on Saturday. “And for him to give us some length and not only be able to pitch well, but dominate, that’s huge.” ', 'This was the most important start that Yamamoto has made for the Dodgers, and it was one of his best, too. In 6 1/3 innings, he allowed just one hit and two walks and struck out four. Yamamoto managed to look his best as he settled in and the night wore on: He retired the last 11 batters he saw. It was a performance made all the more impressive by the fact that it had been more than four months since he worked so deep into a game. ', 'A strained rotator cuff kept Yamamoto out for much of this summer. Entering Saturday, he had not thrown more than 79 pitches in any game since he returned to the mound in mid-September, and he had not pitched beyond the fifth inning. While the Dodgers have won in all four of his outings this postseason, his performance had been somewhat uneven, with a notably rough first career playoff start in the National League Division Series. Yet he cruised through the middle innings of his first World Series game with such ease that Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts had no doubts about letting him go past 80 pitches to get to the seventh inning.', ""“Watching how he was throwing the baseball,” the manager said, “there wasn't much stress in the game.”"", 'Asked what he thought had played up the best for him, Yamamoto gave a straightforward answer: “Everything was working well today,” he said through an interpreter. Which was similar to the answer given by Yankees manager Aaron Boone. “I thought his fastball was good, slowing us down with a little curveball, and then the slider and the split, of course,” he said. In other words? Everything. It was a showcase of what the diminutive righty can be at his best.', 'This particular stage may not be familiar to Yamamoto. But he’s delivered in championship series before. Nearly a year ago, in his final professional game in Nippon Professional Baseball, he took the mound for Game 6 of the Japan Series. He stepped up with one of the most dazzling performances of his decorated career: Yamamoto threw a complete game on 138 pitches and set a record with 14 strikeouts.

While the extent of the subluxation is not yet known, if Ohtani is unable to play again this week, it won’t just be a blow to the Los Angeles Dodgers, it will be a blow to MLB’s entire World Series marketing plan.', '“Once in a Generation. Twice” is the league’s tagline for the series, but through two games, the two generational players haven’t quite delivered. Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge, the presumed AL MVP winner, is 1-for-9 so far, which doesn’t exactly change the captain un-clutch narrative that seems to follow him year after year in the postseason.', 'Ohtani, the presumed NL MVP winner, hasn’t yet broken out in the series either, though he hasn’t exactly disappointed in his first postseason. However, MLB will surely be disappointed if his shoulder keeps him out of action.', 'A Yankees-Dodgers World Series is a dream matchup from a marketing standpoint. It’s two iconic franchises in the two largest media markets in the country with five MVPs and a Cy Young Award winner between the two teams with Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Gerrit Cole wearing pinstripes, and Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts wearing Dodger Blue. Tons of money was spent to advertise the series in Times Square, Beverly Hills and beyond.', '“More eyeballs are going to be watching this World Series than any other Series in history,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts predicted Thursday.', 'The series also has global appeal the league is hoping to capitalize on. MLB partnered with advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy on a campaign in Tokyo. The agency responsible for Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan collaborated with MLB on the placement of 113 billboards in Ohtani’s home country, one for each home run he hit and each base he stole this season.', 'FOX Sports is also hoping the Judge-Ohtani combo will bring more eyes to the broadcast after record-low ratings last year. Viewership habits have changed with streaming and Gen Z isn’t nearly as interested in watching sports as older generations. America’s pastime isn’t the most popular sport in America anymore, so the hope is that this marquee matchup would drive more interest.', 'Judge’s struggles aren’t going to dissuade viewers from tuning in, but the Yankees need his bat and his leadership if they’re going to get back into this series and extend it. Manager Aaron Boone thinks it’s an issue of swing decisions.', '“Look, I think swing decisions are part of it,” Boone said after Game 2. “I think everyone is different in how they get loaded and started and on time, and then your swing comes out…That’s ultimately what hitting is about — it’s getting in the best position to make a good swing decision but also be in a strong position to get a good swing off. Everyone is different in how they do that, and I think he’s working through that a little bit right now.”', 'Judge has struck out in two thirds of his World Series at-bats so far. He owns a .199 average in 55 career postseason games and a .740 OPS.', 'The two standout performers so far haven’t exactly been unexpected, though they did largely fly under the radar in the week leading up to Game 1, Juan Soto for the Yankees and Freeman for the Dodgers.', 'Juan Soto, the hero that sent the Yankees to the World Series with his clutch homer in the ALCS, hit another one in Game 2 to briefly give New York the lead. It accounted for one of the two hits allowed by right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The intrigue and interest around his impending free agency grows with every big hit.', '“I think he made mistakes against me,” Soto said. “He made a couple of good pitches in the first at-bat. He showed me everything that he got in my first at-bat, so I was ready for anything my second at-bat. He made a mistake, and I just didn’t miss it.”', 'Freeman hit the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history in Game 1, drawing parallels to Kirk Gibson’s homer in the 1988 series off Oakland’s Dennis Eckersley in the very same ballpark. The sprained ankle that limited the eight-time All-Star in the previous two playoff rounds has not been an issue in this one. He hit another home run in Game 2 off left-hander Carlos Rodon.', 'NLCS MVP Tommy Edman hasn’t exactly been an easy out either. The Dodgers utility man also has some international appeal as a Korean-American. His mother, Maureen Kwak, was born in South Korea and Edman played for the South Korean team in last year’s World Baseball Classic. Injured all season, then traded at the deadline from the St. Louis Cardinals, Edman is the feel-good story of the playoffs.', 'But Ohtani and Judge are the true superstars of the series.

Shohei Ohtani Suffers Shoulder Subluxation,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2024/10/shohei-ohtani-suffers-shoulder-subluxation.html,"['MLB Trade Rumors', 'By Nick Deeds | October 27, 2024 at 5:15pm CDT', '5:15PM: Roberts told ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez (links to X), the Athletic’s Fabian Ardaya (X link), and other reporters that Ohtani will work out and take swings at Yankee Stadium later tonight, hitting off a tee and in the batting cage.  The shoulder issue seems to be about pain tolerance for Ohtani, and Roberts said “if he feels good enough to go, I don’t see any reason why he wouldn’t be in there” for the Game 3 lineup.', 'TODAY, 1:47PM: Roberts told Karl Ravech of ESPN this afternoon that Ohtani is “in a great spot” following last night’s injury and that he’s expected to be in the lineup for Game 3 tomorrow evening in New York.', 'Oct 26: A heart-stopping moment occurred for Dodgers fans in the bottom of the seventh inning tonight when Shohei Ohtani attempted to steal second base. Ohtani was tagged out by Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres but appeared to suffer an injury on the play and was escorted off the field by a team trainer. After the game, manager Dave Roberts told reporters (including The Athletic’s Fabian Ardaya) that Ohtani had suffered a “little” shoulder subluxation, or partial dislocation. The star will undergo additionally testing tomorrow, and though Roberts emphasized that he did not want to speculate on the severity of the injury until those tests were completed, he noted that they’re “encouraged” by initial tests and that he’s “expecting” Ohtani to be back in the lineup for Game 3 on Monday.', 'It’s a potentially devastating blow to the Dodgers as they look to capture their first full-season World Series championship since 1988. While Ohtani has been unable to pitch this year after undergoing elbow surgery last September, it’s impossible to call his first season with the club anything other than an absolute success. The 30-year-old superstar slashed an eye-popping .310/.390/.646 (181 wRC+) in 159 games for the Dodgers this year and became the first player in MLB history to steal at least 50 bases (59) and hit at least 50 home runs (54) in a single season. Ohtani’s dynamic play has also been a key factor in the club’s postseason run to this point, as he had slashed an impressive .277/.414/.489 with three home runs and ten RBI during the playoffs this year entering tonight’s game.', 'Whether the Dodgers will have that explosive offensive talent in the lineup for the remainder of the series remains to be seen. While the severity of Ohtani’s injury is not currently clear, an injury of any significance will leave he and the Dodgers forced to balance the star’s health with their goal of closing out a World Series championship they’re just two victories away from clinching. Other players on the Dodgers’ roster, including fellow star Freddie Freeman and veteran shortstop Miguel Rojas, have played through injuries this postseason in hopes of bringing a World Series home to Los Angeles. If the Dodgers take a similar course of action with Ohtani and his shoulder issue is fairly mild, it’s possible to imagine him being back in the club’s lineup when the series moves to New York for Game 3 on Monday night.', 'That’s far from a guarantee, however, and it’s equally easy to imagine the issue being severe enough to leave Ohtani at risk of missing the rest of the series. If the injury proves to be severe enough for the Dodgers to remove Ohtani from their playoff roster, outfielders Kevin Kiermaier and James Outman would appear to be the most likely options for the club to consider activating in place of their superstar on the playoff roster. Meanwhile, Ohtani vacating the DH spot in the lineup would allow the club to offer additional rest to Freeman, who has played through the postseason on a sprained ankle and could benefit from the additional time off his feet. In such a scenario, Max Muncy would likely slide over from third base to cover first for Freeman, opening up the hot corner for Enrique Hernandez and second base for Gavin Lux.', 'Of course, with just five months left to Opening Day 2025, a particularly severe injury could not only leave Ohtani unavailable for the remainder of the World Series but potentially impact his Spring Training and readiness for the start of next year. Red Sox shortstop Trevor Story underwent what was believed to be season-ending shoulder surgery back in April following an initial diagnosis similar to Ohtani’s after Story awkwardly landed on his shoulder during a play in the field. Surgery wound up being necessary due to structural damage in his shoulder and came with an initial six-month recovery timeline, though Story managed to return ahead of schedule in just five.', 'The Dodgers are quite familiar with the perils of dislocated shoulders, as during the 2020 NLCS Cody Bellinger suffered a dislocated right shoulder that he played through in their last World Series run but ultimately required surgery on. That procedure came with a recovery timeline of just ten weeks but Bellinger infamously struggled badly over his next two seasons with the Dodgers, leading to questions regarding whether or not he returned to action before he was fully healthy. However severe Ohtani’s injury turns out to be, one silver lining for the Dodgers is that Ohtani’s left shoulder is the one at issue, meaning his pitching arm is likely to be minimally impacted by the issue as he looks toward a return to the mound in 2025.', 'LOS ANGELES DODGERS NEWSSTAND\nSHOHEI OHTANI', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'MLB Trade Rumors is not affiliated with Major League Baseball, MLB or MLB.com', '', '', '', '', '']"

Shohei Ohtani injury: Where Dodgers could turn if superstar misses time during 2024 World Series,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/shohei-ohtani-injury-where-dodgers-could-turn-if-superstar-misses-time-during-2024-world-series/,"['', 'In the seventh inning of the Los Angeles Dodgers\' eventual 4-2 win over the New York Yankees in Game 2 of the World Series, Dodgers superstar DH Shohei Ohtani suffered a partially dislocated left shoulder while sliding into second base on an unsuccessful steal attempt. The good news is that Dodgers manager Dave Roberts on Sunday told ESPN that Ohtani is ""in a great spot and will be playing in Game 3 tomorrow."" ', ""That, obviously, is an excellent outcome for the Dodgers as the scene shifts to the Bronx and they attempt to make good on their 2-0 lead in the series. All that said, what if Ohtani suffers a setback between now and then or re-injures the shoulder? The hope and likelihood is that neither of those things comes to pass, but it's worth pondering just the same. Framed another way: What will the Dodgers do if Ohtani still winds up missing time during what's left of the 2024 World Series? "", ""To say the least, Ohtani's absence would be a dominating one. During the regular season, Ohtani, who took the season off from his usual pitching duties as he recovers from elbow surgery, slashed .310/.390/.646 in an NL-leading 731 plate appearances, and with 54 home runs and 59 stolen bases he authored the first 50-50 season in Major League Baseball history. As well, Ohtani led the NL with an OPS+ of 190 and led the majors with 411 total bases. As such, he's the heavy favorite to win NL MVP honors. "", ""Coming off a strong NLCS performance against the Mets, Ohtani through the first two games of this World Series has not made much of an impact. Against the Yankees, he's gone 1 for 7 with a double, a walk, a caught stealing, and a run scored. Yes, the Dodgers have managed to take the first two games of the series without much from Ohtani, but, to state the obvious, the concern is his availability for the two to five games left to play. "", ""If something else happens to Ohtani's marred shoulder or if his current prognosis changes, then the Dodgers are facing two possibilities – one, Ohtani misses one or more games but is able to play later in the series, or, two, Ohtani is ruled out for the rest of the series, which forces a roster move. "", ""On the first possibility, Roberts would likely take advantage of the DH vacancy to shore up his occasionally flawed infield defense. The guess here is that, if Ohtani remains rostered but misses at least Game 3, Freddie Freeman and his still-ailing ankle – not that you'd know it from Freeman's production thus far in the series – shift to DH to ease his in-game burdens. Then Max Muncy would shift across the diamond from third base to first, and Roberts would populate the hot corner with Enrique Hernández. Gavin Lux would man second base. That arrangement could hold at least through Game 6, as the Yankees will trot out all right-handed starters until, presumably, Carlos Rodon's turn comes up again in a potential Game 7. All those right-handed Yankee starters mean the lefty-swinging Lux probably would've been in the lineup anyway. If Roberts prefers to keep Freeman at first, then Muncy could move to DH instead, and the rest of the shuffling would be as noted above. "", ""If Ohtani's shoulder injury turns out to be severe enough that the Dodgers are forced to make a roster move, then it seems likely they'd summon up another left-handed bat, as their bench would be all right-handed when Lux is in the lineup. That may mean that veteran fly-catcher Kevin Kiermaier, who was on the Dodgers' NLCS roster, would make his return. Another possibility might be outfielder James Outman, but Kiermaier seems like the most likely path. The Dodgers throughout their decade-plus of contention and, often, regular-season dominance have been famous for their deep reserves of position players. That supply of reinforcements may not presently be as strong as it once was, but the Dodgers still have reasonable post-Ohtani options that shouldn't necessarily cripple them. To state the bleedingly obvious, Ohtani would be dearly missed, but there's enough depth and, more important, surrounding star power to get the Dodgers the two additional wins they need. "", ""The other cause for Dodger comfort is that aforementioned 2-0 lead. They've achieved it, as noted, without getting much from Ohtani at the plate, and the bald reality is that the Dodger need to win two more games before the Yankees win four. Historically, teams up 2-0 in a best-of-seven MLB postseason series who opened at home, as the Dodgers did, have gone on to win the series more than 80% of the time. That math is heavily in L.A.'s favor no matter what happens to Ohtani the rest of the way. For now, though, the expectation is that Ohtani will be back where he belongs -- at the very top of Roberts' lineup and making Yankee pitchers who face him most uneasy.
