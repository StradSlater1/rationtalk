Because I simply do not know how to describe what just happened today in Cleveland without insinuating that Jamies is a God among men. Folks, the Browns came into this game with a 1-6 record, tied for worst in the league. The Ravens came into this game with a 5-2 first place in the AFC North record, as well as the 2nd most favorable odds to win the Super Bowl. The Browns had to break in both a new play caller AND new signal caller in this game, against one of the best teams in football, while having not scored 20 points in a single game this season, until.....JAMEIS WINSTON THREW FOR 334 YARDS, 3 TOUCHDOWNS, THE BROWNS SCORED 29 POINTS, AND WE BEAT THE FUCKING RAT BIRDS!!!!!!"", '', '', '', ""(and what's crazy is that the game wasn't even close to the most electric thing....check out his post game)"", ""I mean, you gotta put this guy in the Hall of Fame one day. I don't know if his skills and stats will qualify for Canton, but he is simply too hot on the mic to not get to give a speech in a gold jacket. I'll admit that I walked into the Gambling Cave this morning and said that even Jameis, paired with the spirit of the legend Jimmy Donovan flying above the stadium, wouldn't be enough to overcome how shitty our team is. But then I saw this in the pregame and I quickly changed my tune."", '', '', ""It's crazy to me how much of a different football team we looked like today. Is that really all because Deshaun is unlikable and Jamies is the most likable human on Earth? The crazy thing is….Yes, I really think that's the only difference. We fought today. We scrapped today. We came back we were down today. But even crazier than all that, for the first time this October….and it's the 27th….we actually held a lead today. The Jameis Winston Effect. (Not to mention our quarterback play was simply 1000x better). Hand up, I was flat out wrong that it wasn't all Deshaun Watson. I thought you could sub in Tom Brady in his prime and he wouldn't be able to drag this team out of the shitter. Not only did Jameis do that, he beat the Ravens. Insane."", ""So now I guess the question is where do we go from here? I'm on a Browns high right now, but even under that influence, I still realize we're now 2-6 and have just about a 0.0% chance of doing anything meaningful this year. I figured we need to win 10 games….maybe 9….to make the playoffs. Find me 7 more wins in this slate."", '', ""I see 4 at the max. And that puts us square in the middle of no man's land, where we don't have a top pick but we also don't get to play meaningful football. I said this when they announced Jameis the starter. It's cool and I bet we actually win a few games because of it, but fuck, when it's all said and done….we're going to be deciding what to do with an expensive piece of shit (Deshaun) while trying to draft a franchise QB in the middle of the first round.

(WATE) — Former University of Tennessee standout Cedric Tillman enjoyed his breakout NFL performance on Sunday as he helped the Cleveland Browns to a shock upset of the Baltimore Ravens.', 'With starting quarterback Deshaun Watson out for the season with a ruptured Achilles, Jameis Winston took over the offense and quickly established a connection with Tillman. He hauled in seven catches for 99 yards and two touchdowns, the second of which proved to be the game-winning score with just a minute remaining in the contest.', 'The Browns’ decision to trade their top wide receiver Amari Cooper to the Buffalo Bills thrust Tillman into a pivotal role in their passing game. He has now recorded 15 catches for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the past two weeks.', 'Tillman was drafted by the Browns in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft, one pick after fellow Tennessee Vol Jalin Hyatt. He played in 14 games as rookie, making 21 catches for 224 yards.', 'In 2021, Tillman set a Tennessee program record for most consecutive games with a touchdown catch (7) and became Tennessee’s first 1,000-yard receiver since 2012. His 12 touchdown catches in 2021 were the most ever by a Volunteer in a single season until Hyatt racked up 15 in 2022.', 'His father, also named Cedric, played four season in the NFL from 1992 to 1995 with the Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars.', '', '', 'Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

So our coaches prepare us for those situations every single day. So we were prepared for the situation when it came.”', 'The Browns showed it on the final eight-play drive of the game, the climax of their 29-24 win, as they stalled Baltimore at the Cleveland 24-yard line.', 'Of course, when you’re going against Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, an eight-play drive can feel like an 80-play drive due to his Houdini-esque escape ability.', '“I was so tired, I crawled off the field, but it felt amazing being here, celebrating, jumping around,” edge rusher Ogbo Okoronkwo said. “I think (defensive tackle) Shelby (Harris) slapped my helmet off. We were having a good time.”', 'Coming into Sunday, the Browns and Ravens were on opposite ends of the spectrum.', 'Baltimore had won its previous five games, and Cleveland had lost its previous five. Baltimore came into the game averaging a league-high 461.4 yards per game, and a league-best 210.9 rushing yards per game. The Browns defense was allowing 317.9 total yards per game and 126.1 rushing yards.', 'So when Baltimore had the ball with 59 seconds left, it was hard for the Browns faithful to not fear the worst considering the defensive unit that ranked first in the NFL last year in the regular season has regressed to more modest, middle-of-the-pack stats.', 'But to hear the Browns defenders tell it? This was exactly where they wanted to be.', '“It was electrifying,” star edge rusher Myles Garrett said. “I like being in games where it makes a heart race, makes my heart race, stuff like that. When the competition arises, you got to rise to it, and stuff like that gets me going.”', ""Starting the drive at their own 30, Jackson made three big plays to set Baltimore up at the Browns' 24: A quick 11-yard shot to receiver Nelson Agholar; a 21-yarder to receiver Zay Flowers, who was mismatched on the outside with Browns' safety Grant Delpit; and finally, a short dump off to running back Justice Hill, who was able to manufacture a 14-yard gain, with most of those yards picked up after the catch."", 'On first-and-10, Jackson spiked the ball to stop the clock with just 22 seconds remaining.', 'Then the real fun began.', 'On second-and-10, Jackson quickly scrambled out to his left with Browns edge rusher Za’Darius Smith and rookie DT Michael Hall Jr. in hot pursuit. As Okoronkwo met him near the left sideline, cutting him off, Jackson lobbed the ball out of bounds.', '“Man, it was like a cat chasing a mouse out there,” Hall said. “And Lamar is a hell of a quarterback just fast, fast. You got to cage the pocket, you got to keep him in that pocket. You got to contain it. So that was just the big emphasis this week.”', 'On third-and-10 with 14 seconds remaining, Jackson once again escaped a sack by Smith, scrambling to his right with Hall chasing him down. Jackson was able to get set and throw across his body, delivering the ball across the field towards Flowers near the back left portion of the end zone.', 'Browns cornerback Martin Emerson Jr., however, used his length at 6-2 and tipped the ball away with both hands.', '""I was hoping it was out, I looked up, I have three seconds, so finish the game,"" Emerson said. “Find a way to get the ball on the ground and secure the W. ... (Jackson)’s a special player, uses his feet, a lot of plaster drill, which the receivers are just scrambling around to try to find open spaces. And yeah, it was a physical, tough game. It was fun as hell though.”', 'On fourth-and-10 is when Jackson really pulled out all the stops.', 'Assessing the play, Jackson wound up back near the Cleveland 40. With Smith on his heels, he was pushed all the way back to the 45. Smith actually got a hand on his arm, but was unable to take Jackson down.', ""As Jackson moved towards the Ravens' sideline extending the play, Okoronkwo had enough time to make it over from the other side of the field, meet him and cut him off. While Okoronkwo got two hands in his face, Jackson got the Browns edge rusher to bite and leave his feet with a pump fake."", 'Taking a step up, Jackson threw deep left, once again looking for Flowers. The second-year receiver, however, was unable to get out wide enough and stumbled in the end zone, falling forward as the ball was thrown.', 'Delpit was there, though, and insists he should have had a pick as the ball hit him in the hands.', '""I dropped it,"" Delpit said. “I dropped the hell out of that. That’s bad.”', 'But the game was over regardless.', 'And this ending represented an excellent bounce back for a unit that hasn’t been able to finish games this season.', 'It’s more impressive when you consider the fact that the drive before this stop, the defense gave up a 2-yard touchdown run to Derrick Henry — a score that gave the Ravens a 24-23 lead with only 2:36 remaining in the game.', '""We learned from it, came back, of course the last drive we was running more drop-back deep zone,“ Delpit said. ”So of course they was going to get some chunk plays, but we kept them out of the end zone.""', 'It helped that the pass rush brought so much pressure, even as the Ravens continued to chip, help, and hold Garrett, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year. Two blockers, including veteran left tackle Ronnie Stanley, tripped him up on the final play.', '“Keep going,” Okoronkwo said of his mindset on the final drive. “Keep rushing, keep going. Lamar’s a fantastic player. He is one of the best players in the league. We knew that if we didn’t give it our all that he was going to make something happen. So we just emptied the tank on that last drive.”', 'In the end, the Browns defense limited the Ravens offense in a pretty tame afternoon.', 'Jackson finished with 23-of-38 passing for 289 yards and two touchdowns with a 101.8 rating, and was sacked three times. He ran for an additional 46 yards on eight carries.', 'Henry also didn’t wreck the game. He finished with 73 rushing yards and that one TD on 11 carries, but 39 of those yards came on one run in the second quarter.', '""I did tell y’all I was going to put (Browns left tackle) Dawand (Jones) on scout team running back and y’all see how many yards Derrick Henry had,"" Delpit quipped. “He had one long run, but I told y’all it was going to work.”', 'In the end, the Browns and the defense out-Houdinied Jackson — no easy feat.', 'And in the process, they snapped their own five-game losing streak, and re-discovered some much-needed confidence.', '”I forgot what winning felt like, man,"" Delpit said. “It’s a great feeling.”', '', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"Sorting the Sunday Pile, NFL Week 8: Jameis Winston's win should end Browns-Deshaun Watson experiment forever",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/sorting-the-sunday-pile-nfl-week-8-jameis-winstons-win-should-end-deshaun-watson-experiment-forever/,"['', ""Everyone on Planet Earth with a pulse and a scintilla of interest in professional football knows the Browns Deshaun Watson experiment was unequivocally a complete disaster from start to finish. Hopefully it's finished, anyway, and if it wasn't, Jameis Winston's performance on Sunday in a stunning 29-24 victory over the Baltimore Ravens should be the final nail in the proverbial coffin. "", ""Winston finished the game 27 of 41 for 334 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions (!) and a game-winning bomb to Cedric Tillman just after the two-minute warning to get the Browns their second victory of the season. In Winston's first career start with Cleveland, he joined Baker Mayfield, Trent Dilfer and Kelly Holcomb as the only Browns quarterbacks since 1990 to top 300 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. "", ""Sunday was the first time all season the Browns scored 20+ points in a game. They entered as the only team in the NFL without more than 20 points in a game, which means you can do the math on Watson (0-for-7) and Winston (1-for-1). Scoring 20 points isn't hard in the NFL with a competent offense and Winston did it the week after the Browns traded away his best receiver in Amari Cooper. "", ""Want another low bar for an NFL offense to clear? Winston also became the first Browns quarterback to top 200 yards in a game this season. 200 yards!! Move the marker up to 300 yards and it gets really embarrassing. Winston (1-for-1) and Joe Flacco (6-for-7, including the playoffs) have just one game under center for Kevin Stefanski's offense without throwing for 300 yards. Watson started 19 games for the Browns following his trade and ensuing suspension until his season-ending Achilles tear last week and not once did he top 300 passing yards in a game. "", 'The Browns set season highs for points (29), yardage (401) and pass yardage (321) with Winston under center on Sunday. ', ""It's really difficult for me to blame Stefanski for this, even though until Watson went down he continued to -- almost inexplicably - back Watson as his quarterback. All along it felt like a mandate from ownership to force Watson onto the field despite it being painfully obvious he wasn't the same quarterback we saw in Houston, much less a league-average quarterback."", ""There's a lesson for ownership here: stay in your lane. The Browns were mired in mediocrity for decades. The Haslams came along, bought the team, listened to homeless guys for draft advice, finally stepped away from being heavily involved, let the football people do football things, and the Browns were good for a few years. They clearly pushed the Watson trade through, believing they could take the franchise to the next level. "", ""It was an unmitigated disaster. 19 games of Watson playing poorly in exchange for multiple first-round picks that helped Houston reboot its own franchise. The money Watson got is an equally humiliating disaster of a mistake but -- cap ramifications aside obviously -- it's ultimately just cash being shelled out by really rich people on a wildly unnecessary expenditure. "", ""What I really wonder is where the Browns would be if they'd simply stayed the course with Mayfield, or built a team around lower-profile quarterbacks like Flacco and Winston and let Stefanski run his system the way he wants to, without forcing some kind of allegedly Watson-ified scheme with a quarterback whose game doesn't even match up with what his own head coach wants to do offensively. "", 'Jameis might not rally the Browns to the playoffs. The hole at 2-6 could certainly be too deep in a competitive AFC. But the Browns -- who have four losses by one score in which the defense gave up 21 points or less -- are now just two games out of the playoffs with some winnable games left on the schedule. ', ""Winston's been around forever, but he's still just 30 years old and a former No. 1 overall pick. At the very least the Browns are finally likeable, for the first time since the last time Watson got hurt and they put a fun veteran quarterback under center in Flacco. If that isn't enough to call the dogs on the Watson experiment once and for all I have no clue what it would actually take. "", ""At some point Jared Goff's efficiency heater might cool off and maybe him throwing for 85 yards in a 52-14 win qualifies, but Goff could have done a lot more on Sunday if he needed to. He just didn't. He attempted only 15 passes, completed 12 of them and threw for three touchdowns, plus David Montgomery going 1-for-1 with a touchdown pass to Sam LaPorta meaning Detroit's run of more touchdowns than incompletions gets extended another week. "", ""An opportunistic defense and a dominant run game, along with an A+ effort from special teams -- including a Khalif Raymond revenge return touchdown -- left Detroit with short fields -- the Lions had five TD drives of less than 30 yards, no other team has more than three in a game since 2000 -- and no need to chuck the ball around. It also meant the Lions moved to 6-1, the first time they've started a season this well since 1956. "", ""The Titans were frisky early in this one, but the Lions didn't flinch and kept piling on, eventually scoring the second-most points in team history (55 on Thanksgiving in 1997 is the record) and Goff stepping aside for Hayden Hooker garbage time snaps. "", ""Detroit's 225 yards is the fewest ever in a 50-point game by an NFL team. The Lions became the first team in the play-by-play era (1991) to score 30+ points in the first half of a game with less than 30 passing yards in the half. Detroit topped the 30-point mark for the fourth-straight game, tying the franchise record (also 1997). "", ""Their touchdown (25) to incompletion (20) ratio over the last five games is the first time a team's pulled that off since the Jim Brown's Cleveland teams did it over the course of two seasons in 1959 and 1960. "", ""What's stood out to me over this hot streak is how the Lions can beat you so many different ways. Goff has been laser sharp as of late and defending the myriad weapons at his disposal is virtually impossible. Offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is completely locked in right now. He's dialing up stuff like a David Montgomery touchdown pass -- Montgomery has two career attempts now -- and doing it despite the Lions holding a double-digit lead. "", ""Amon-Ra St. Brown caught a goal line touchdown completely uncovered, which should make zero sense, but Johnson is just seeing the matrix from a play-calling perspective and is two steps ahead of his defensive counterparts right now. Jahmyr Gibbs and Mongtomery -- a.k.a. Sonic and Knuckles -- are a lethal combo behind what might be the league's best offensive line. "", ""Even without Aiden Hutchinson the defense has more than enough playmakers at all levels to flip the field at any moment. This is a special team on a special run for a city very deserving of some good football. Here's hoping it doesn't slow down any time soon."", ""I'm not sure if National Tight End Day is recognized by anyone other than folks who watch football, but it's clearly a thing around the league because Sunday was a stupid explosion for the big guys who have morphed into elite pass catchers. "", ""When Kyle Pitts -- 91 yards and two touchdowns -- is blowing up you know it's become a thing. Cade Otton -- nine catches, 81 yarsd and a pair of scores as Baker Mayfield's primary pass catcher -- nearly equalled him in the Falcons 31-26 key divisional victory. The combo also paid off REAL nice for this guy:"", 'Tyler Conklin caught a touchdown from Aaron Rodgers in the Jets humiliating 25-22 loss to the Patriots. Both David Njoku and Mark Andrews found the end zone in the aforementioned Browns upset. Two of the Lions tight ends scored. Tucker Kraft -- 78 yards and a score on three catches -- and Evan Engram both found the end zone in a wild Packers/Jaguars game that saw Jordan Love exit with injury and the Packers still steal a win. Trey McBride went off for 124 yards on nine catches against the Dolphins in a rousing comeback by Kyler Murray and the Cardinals, which naturally featured some ""Call of Duty"" sniping from Kyler after. ', 'Travis Kelce was already up to six catches, 61 yards and a score at halftime of his matchup against the Raiders. Adam Trautman (!!) went off for 85 yards and a score in the first half against Carolina. Dalton Kincaid found the end zone for the Bills and Zach Ertz was a fraction away from doing the same early for Washington. ', ""You can't set a fantasy lineup with nothing but tight ends, which is too bad because it would have destroyed on Sunday. "", 'October has been a disaster for Gang Green. It started with a loss to the Vikings in London, which was immediately followed by the Jets firing Robert Saleh and demoting Nathaniel Hackett from calling plays. Less than a week later, the Jets lost to the Bills on Monday night and promptly traded for Davante Adams. They followed that up with a loss the Steelers on Sunday night in Week 7, despite looking in control of the game at halftime. ', 'Surely -- SURELY -- a matchup against the hapless Patriots in Week 8 would cure their ills. ', '*Narrator*: ""It did not cure their ills.""', ""Instead the Jets found themselves on the losing end of a 25-22 effort despite Drake Maye leaving with a concussion before halftime and hot-seat rumors swirling around Jerod Mayo just two months into his first year as Pats head coach. The Jets inability to win as massive favorites in Foxborough means they still haven't swept the Patriots since 2000. "", ""The last time the Jets swept New England, they had more Super Bowl titles (1) than New England (0) and Aaron Rodgers was in high school. It's the third-longest streak of not sweeping a division opponent behind the Lions/Packers (25 years, ended in 2016) and the Browns/Steelers (32 years, still active somehow). "", ""Rodgers is now 2-6 as a starter, the worst record of his career through eight games. He's thrown 12 passing touchdowns, the lowest number through eight games of his career. He's thrown seven interceptions, the second-worst mark through eight games of his career. His 85.1 passer rating eight games in ... also the worst of his career. "", 'Talk about a game that initially didn\'t live up to the hype only to deliver in the biggest way possible. Just as I was thinking ""man, maybe Bo Nix is live for OROY"" No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams works the Bears down in position to beat No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels ... only to have his fullback (played by backup guard Doug Kramer) fumble.

Browns offense with Jameis Winston finally delivered on the promise of what it could have been all season: Dan Labbe,https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2024/10/browns-offense-with-jameis-winston-finally-delivered-on-the-promise-of-what-it-could-have-been-all-season-dan-labbe.html,"['CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Browns went over 200 passing yards and reached the 20-point mark for the first time on Sunday, marks that previously felt akin to trying to colonize Mars. You were starting to wonder if you’d see it in your lifetime.', 'It wasn’t impossible on Sunday, and they actually did it in the third quarter of their 29-24 win over the Ravens. Quarterback Jameis Winston threw for 334 yards and three touchdowns in his first start with the Browns.', 'To say the offense had a spark is an understatement. The Browns didn’t transform into the 1999 Rams, but it felt different, especially when Winston connected with wide receiver Cedric Tillman for a 22-yard touchdown pass to give the Browns a 20-17 lead with 2:01 left in the third quarter, the play that finally got them to the elusive 20-point mark.', 'Week 8 NFL Preview: Find everything you need to know with our Week 8 NFL preview.', 'Then he connected with Tillman again on a 38-yard go-ahead bomb, another feat that felt impossible just a week ago, a deep pass to a receiver who got behind the defense.', 'This is the offense the Browns and their fans have been waiting for all season and, sure, you can point to some of the other factors — a healthier offensive line, Nick Chubb playing his second straight game, a new play-caller — but this was as much about the quarterback as anything else.', 'The offense didn’t grind to a halt every time something bad happened. The ball was leaving Winston’s hand on time and going where it was supposed to go — well, most of the time — and the passing game didn’t feel like it was operating in a phone booth.', 'There are certain things you have to live with when it comes to Winston — like when he took 5.5 seconds to throw the ball to a Ravens defender. (He dropped it.) Or that throw to Kyle Hamilton that nearly ended the game. (He dropped it, too.)', 'Tougher defenses will present tougher challenges, but it sure feels nice to feel good about the offense for once.', 'Winston isn’t the long-term answer, but he answered some questions about the Browns offense and one of its core problems on Sunday. They needed better play from their quarterback.', 'The Ravens already had the worst passing defense in the league on Sunday before playing this game without two of their starting cornerbacks, but they haven’t exactly played a murderers’ row of defenses this season coming into Sunday.', 'The Browns and Winston were able to attack Baltimore consistently and we saw things we hadn’t seen all season from this passing attack. Even Elijah Moore showed signs of life and made two of the game’s most important catches, a 15-yard completion to the Ravens’ 37, keeping a drive moving that ended in Dustin Hopkins’ bank shot 48-yard field goal to give the Browns a 23-17 lead.', 'He made another big catch to convert a third-and-7 and give the Browns a chance to run out the clock and kick the game-winning field goal.', 'Tillman had the best game of his career, catching seven passes for 99 yards and the first two touchdowns of his career. Jerry Jeudy went from being frustrated last week to a 5-catch, 79-yard day.', 'David Njoku added five catches for 61 yards and a touchdown.', 'It had a very Flacco-like feel, the quarterback bringing dormant pass-catchers back to life.', 'The Browns won’t have the opportunity to see Deshaun Watson for 17 games this season, but they saw him for seven games and, when they switched to Winston for the eighth game, there was a stark difference.', 'Yes, there were other changes, but you finally saw what this offense can look like when the quarterback is decisive and can pressure a team with downfield throws.', 'Jameis Winston might not be the answer, but he provided some answers on Sunday.', 'If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

What led most to the Browns' offensive explosion vs. Ravens? 'Everything' | Takeaways,https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/sports/pro/browns/2024/10/28/cleveland-browns-game-ravens-offense-ken-dorsey-jameis-winston/75878281007/,"['CLEVELAND — It\'s the whole ""correlation vs. causation"" argument, only on a football field. Whatever it may be, the Browns are more than happy to take the end results.', ""A quarterback change necessitated by Deshaun Watson's season-ending Achilles injury last Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals led to Jameis Winston's insertion into the starting lineup for Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens. That move wasn't the surprising one of the week."", 'The one that was came when Browns coach Kevin Stefanski handed the play-calling duties over to offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey. It was the move that Stefanski, who had called the plays since being hired in 2020, seemed never likely to make until he did this week.', 'On Sunday, the Browns offense — with Winston at the controls — was the story as the team snapped a five-game losing streak with a 29-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens. They rolled up 401 total yards and Winston threw for 334 yards, both season highs for Cleveland.', 'To Winston, those two things were the correlation — the changes at quarterback and play-caller — that does not, in fact, imply causation, which was the offensive explosion. To say that, according to the 10-year veteran, discounts so much.', '""Yeah, a lot of people had their factors,"" Winston said after his first start since Week 3 of the 2022 season with the New Orleans Saints. ""Offensive line played great all day. We were efficient in the run game, guys were open, but at the beginning of the week we had this change. Our head coach stopped calling plays, like, why did he do that? Ken Dorsey had stepped up.', '""But that just shows great leadership from the top down with Coach Kevin being certain about this decision to change. And Ken showed up, he put in great work and he did an outstanding job today to lead us.""', 'The change that some in the Browns locker room credit the outcome to is more tangible than just guessing what percentage of a number each of the variables played in the result. It was the numbers they were putting up on the scoreboard.', 'The Browns had 11 drives against the Ravens, including seven that ended up in Baltimore territory. Of those seven, six ended up with Cleveland scoring points.', '“It was everything,” wide receiver Elijah Moore said. “I feel like there becomes a certain point where people just become tired of not finishing games. I feel like that’s what we did today.”', 'The offense was most effective in the second half, when four of six possessions reached Ravens territory. Three of those were turned into touchdowns, with wide receiver Cedric Tillman scoring two — including a go-ahead 38-yard TD catch with 59 seconds left — and tight end David Njoku getting one.', ""Over the five-game losing streak entering the game, Cleveland's offense had produced just three second-half touchdowns combined. It also had a defensive score in Week 4 when Rodney McLeod returned a fumble for a TD against the Las Vegas Raiders."", '“We just tried to fight, man,"" Tillman said. ""We\'ve been talking about it all week. Fight, fight, fight, being resilient, and that\'s what we did today.”', 'The Browns offensive line has been a M*A*S*H unit the entire season. Sunday may have been the closest to complete the group has been, with right guard Wyatt Teller back off the injured list.', 'Teller gave the Browns four starters in their normal spots, along with left guard Joel Bitonio, center Ethan Pocic and right tackle Jack Conklin. Dawand Jones, normally a right tackle, started for the first time in the NFL at left tackle in place of the injured Jedrick Wills Jr.', '""I think the O-line played better today,"" Bitonio said. ""I\'ll have to go back and look, having Wyatt and Poe back healthy, Jack in there, Dawand stepped up and played some left tackle for us as well. I thought the receivers were doing well, but obviously Jameis stepped in and played really good. I think that was the main part of it.""', 'Winston was sacked just twice by the Ravens. That likely was a combination of the line playing better and of his ability to get rid of the football quicker than Watson.', 'Still, outside of the Kyle Hamilton strip-sack in the second quarter when he came completely untouched on a safety blitz, there were few complete line busts. That was especially true for Jones, who last played left tackle in 2020 while at Ohio State.', '""I think pretty good,"" Bitonio said. ""I was trying to communicate with him all game and there\'s obviously a couple of plays we want to have back. As a lineman, you play 60, 70 plays, but I think it was good. I think the protection especially was very, very solid.""', ""Nick Chubb played his second game on Sunday since returning from last year's season-ending knee injury. The running back saw a slightly bigger load than the previous week, going from 11 carries to 16 attempts."", 'Chubb also went up in yards gained, from 22 yards against the Bengals to 52 yards against the Ravens. He also showed a bit of a burst with a 15-yard run in the second quarter.', '“I wouldn’t say we took all the pitch count off,"" Stefanski said. ""Still want to be smart with Nick in the second game back, but he’s moving well. He feels good. So, we’ll continue to monitor that as we go.”', 'That increased usage showed up in the second half. Chubb had just one second-half carry against Cincinnati, but he had six against Baltimore.', 'All of that was part of a day on which the Browns ran 23 times for 80 yards as a team. That at least allowed for the play-action game to be more effective.', '“Yeah, I think that always opens up run action, play action plays,"" Teller said. ""We had a lot of drop-backs. We protected all right, but we have a lot to go.”', 'Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com. Read more about the Browns at www.beaconjournal.com/sports/browns.

Donovan passed away following a lengthy battle with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. “A lot of my memories are hearing him making the calls and about going to the playoffs – you hear Chubb, Chubba Wubba, all those plays go back to his voice,” left guard Joel Bitonio said. “I’ve only been here 11 years, so I know a lot of people had him for 25, but it was very cool that we could get that win for him... He is truly a part of this family and it was awesome to get the win for him.” The team also set up a nice memorial in the press box honoring Donovan, who was on the player's mind all day. “As long as I’ve been around, he’s been the voice of the Browns,” Defensive end Myles Garrett said. “He’s been calling plays since my first sack to some of the very last ones. So it’s definitely a hard loss and we all felt it and we appreciate everything that he’s brought to being a Brown and being part of this organization because there was no one like him.” Head coach Kevin Stefanski and other members of the organization planned to deliver Sunday's game ball to Donovan's family Sunday evening. “I had a lot of reasons for wanting to win this game, but one of them was so I can give that game ball to Cheryl Donovan and Meghan Donovan,” Stefanski said. “Jim was so important to this organization. He was a friend of mine. I’m going to miss him. But his enthusiasm, his spirit will never be lost on many and won’t be lost in this football team. But these guys fought like crazy. So, I’m proud to say that I can go give them a game ball.”"", 'Help from above – It’s hard not to believe Jim Donovan gave the Browns a helping hand from above Sunday. “I think Jim would appreciate that,” Stefanski said. “Ravens kicker Justin Tucker missed a 50-yard field goal, and he never misses. Dustin Hopkins banked in a 48-yard field goal that would normally bounce out that gave the Browns a 23-17 lead. The Ravens missed out on a couple of opportunities to pick off Winston, including safety Kyle Hamilton bobbling then dropping the pick that could’ve sealed the win and allowed Winston to throw the game-winning touchdown to Tillman on the very next play. “I started praying instantly. It was only by the grace of God,” Winston said. “And I think when situations like that happen, you always sit back and you’re like, ‘Man, I still got the stuff to work on,’ right? Because it could have been a matter of whatever. Who knows how we would feel right now if that would have happened. But I’m so grateful that that was an ‘if’. And ‘ifs’, and ‘shoulds’, and ‘would’ve, could’ves’ don’t mean nothing in this game.” And then the Browns defense hung on in the closing seconds to deny Lamar Jackson and the Ravens a sixth straight win. “We just knew the game was on us,” safety Grant Delpit said. “They had to drive that long field and score, so we knew that we wouldn’t want it any other way, it’s on us. I was supposed to end the game with a pick, I dropped it, I don’t know what was wrong with my hands today. That’s probably my first drop of my career so that’s not going to happen again, I promise.”', 'What a difference a QB makes – Winston helped the Browns check off a trio of season highs Sunday: scoring (29 points), passing yards (321) and total yards (401). The Browns can say what they want, but it is undeniable – the problem all along has been the quarterback. “I don’t really get wrapped up in it, honestly,” Stefanski said. “I want to make sure that we’re doing everything in our power to score points on offense to help this football team. That’s a great team win there. I think all three phases did their job. Again, did all three phases play perfect? Nope, we didn’t. But we fought like crazy.” The last seven regular season games started by someone not named Deshaun Watson has seen 300-yard passing games in five of them, and that includes last season’s throwaway, play the backups game against the Bengals. Nobody wants to say it, but the writing is on the wall as plain as day – the ruptured Achilles shouldn’t end Deshaun Watson’s career in Cleveland. Winston’s performance Sunday should.', 'Seesaw third – Tight end David Njoku regained the lead for the Browns on their opening possession of the second half by hauling in a 23-yard touchdown from Winston over Ravens safety Eddie Jackson to give Cleveland a 13-10 lead. The grab capped an eight-play, 70-yard drive. Jackson countered by finding tight end Mark Andrews for a 7-yard touchdown that put Baltimore on top 17-13 with 4:42 remaining in the third quarter to cap a six-play, 62-yard drive. Cedric Tillman’s 22-yard touchdown catch with 2:01 left in the third quarter put the Browns back in front, 20-17.', 'Henry the 11th – Ravens running back Derrick henry scored his 11th touchdown of the season – a two-yard run with 2:36 to play in the fourth quarter to put Baltimore in front 24-23. Henry has scored in every game this season.', 'Turnover to points – Baltimore took a 10-6 lead into halftime thanks to a strip sack of Winston by Kyle Hamilton off a safety blitz from the left side that was recovered by linebacker Trenton Simpson at the 25. Jackson found Nelson Agholor on the second play of the possession for an 11-yard TD', 'Counter trey – The Ravens wasted little time waltzing down the field on their opening drive but ran into a brick wall of brown and orange on fourth-and-1 from the seven. Henry took the direct snap and was dropped by Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and Maurice Hurst at the 10. Cleveland went 14 plays and 81 yards to set up Hopkins’ 28-yard field goal with less than a minute to play in the first quarter for a 3-0 lead.', 'Climbing the ladder – With 52 rushing yards on 16 carries, Nick Chubb passed Mike Pruitt for the third-most rushing yards in Browns history.', 'I’ll be back – Myles Garrett continued his annual tradition of wearing a Halloween costume into the stadium.

The offense finally produced points with 27 seconds left in the first half off an 11-yard touchdown pass from Lamar Jackson to Nelson Agholor.', 'That helps paint the picture of how the Browns’ defense matched up with Baltimore on Sunday.', '“[The Browns defense] were triggering. They had the safeties all down [and] linebackers. They were switching it up; they were doing a good job of switching it up, but the read was still the same. They did a good job though,” Jackson said.', 'Playing in his 11th career game versus Cleveland, Jackson gave the Browns their props after the game.', '“People will probably look at the Browns record and [say], ‘Oh, that’s a sorry team,’ but this is the NFL. I always say that ‘This is the NFL,’ and any given Sunday, a team can be good,” Jackson said. “Any given Sunday, a team can wake up, and it could be their day.”', 'Before Sunday, Cleveland’s defense had yet to produce four good quarters. It was usually one half of play, or separate quarters where they’d show up. Never the whole game.', 'They showed up versus their divisional rival and kept Jackson to a 289 passing yards on a season low 60.5% completion rate. Jackson was sacked more times (three) than he had touchdown passes (two).', 'The intensity was there from the start, especially when the Browns kept Derrick Henry from converting on a fourth and 2 on the first series of the game, a call head coach John Harbaugh stood by.', '“We were going to go for it [on anything from] one [or] one-and-a-half [yards] – anything inside of two. Early in the game, that was our metric the whole time,” Harbaugh said.', 'With Jackson in the pocket, though, he eventually found his cohesion with the receiving corps. Zay Flowers caught seven passes for 115 yards (16.4 per reception), but it came down to the little things later in the game.', 'The offensive line struggled with the Browns pass rush, and the Ravens only converted on two of their 10 third-down attempts — a different look for an offense that ranked second in third-down conversion percentage.', '“I just don’t think we followed the script. First and foremost, I don’t think we executed at the highest level,” wide receiver Rashod Bateman said. “We played behind the chains a lot, and we can’t do that. We’ve just got to continue to make plays – somehow, someway – and [be] consistent going down the field.”', 'Bateman’s 28-yard catch on the fourth play of the game was his only catch through five targets. His other four targets were through tight coverage, and the sun in his eyes.', 'On a third-and-14 during the fourth quarter, 15 yards away from their own end zone, Jackson bought some time until finding an open target downfield. It was Bateman deep on the Brownie the Elf midfield logo, but it bounced right off him.', '“The sun got me on that one deep ball, I’ve got to catch those,” Bateman said. “I saw the ball all the way up to the last minute, and then the ball went directly into the sun. I can’t do anything about that.”', 'Baltimore’s run defense ranked first in fewest rushing yards allowed coming into the game (68.4). They rank last in passing yards (287.1 per game).', 'There was no better example of this than on Sunday.', 'While they did a solid job limiting Cleveland’s run game to 80 yards on 23 carries (3.5 per carry), the pass defense allowed Jameis Winston, who hadn’t started a game since Week 3 of the 2022 season, to ball out.', 'Winston completed 224 of his 334 total passing yards in the second half, along with all three touchdowns. Winston made deep throws from the jump, including a 20-yarder to David Njoku on his first pass.', '“We’re the Ravens, we pride ourselves on defense,” defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike said. “This is a game we should have won, and we didn’t, so it’s very frustrating. And I know a lot of guys feel the same way I feel.”', 'Ahead of Winston’s 38-yard game-winning touchdown to Cedric Tillman, Madubuike was battling guard Wyatt Teller. By the time he passed Teller and ran down toward Winston, the ball was released.', '“The fact that we didn’t [stop the Browns from scoring], it hurts a little bit; it hurts a little bit. But hey, what can you do? The game is over,” Madubuike said. “Kudos to the Browns; they played a good game and they won, congratulations to them. But we know who should have really won that game.”', 'The Ravens secondary hit the field without their usual cornerbacks in Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins.', '“It’s tough, but we trust the guys that are going to go out there. Even the backups or anything like that – everybody can play. We trust those guys, but of course it’s tough,” safety Ar’Darius Washington said after recording three tackles.', 'A big topic after the game ended were the multiple near-interceptions thrown by Winston, but Baltimore just couldn’t catch any of them.', '“We’re just not making those plays when they come to us; it’s just [as] simple as that. We just have to make them,” safety Eddie Jackson said. “There’s no big theory behind it, we’re just in a funk right now that we have to get out of, because a lot of those are big game-changing plays, if we make those.”', 'The biggest drop was by Kyle Hamilton late in the fourth quarter, that would’ve iced out the game with their 24-23 lead.

[It’s] as simple as that,” Jackson said, who tied a game-high 10 tackles with Hamilton.', 'Jackson, who spent seven seasons with Chicago, was on the 2023 Bears squad that blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost by three in Week 15 to the Browns. The frustration in falling to a resilient Browns team again was evident.', '“There’s no excuse for anything that happened out there, we just have to make those plays when they come to us.

Cedric Tillman (seven catches, 99 yards, two touchdowns) and Elijah Moore (eight catches, 85 yards) consistently found holes in Baltimore's defense."", ""On Tillman's first touchdown, there was confusion on the Ravens' defense before the snap and he was left wide open on slant pattern across the middle. That's an area of the field where Baltimore has struggled all season and it's concerning that issue has not been solved yet."", ""Hamilton was the Ravens' best player on the field in this game, so it was a cruel twist of fate that he dropped what could've been a game-winning interception.

', 'Here is what that stretch looked like from DTR and Walker:  ', 'Dorian Thompson-Robinson:', '• 19-of-36, 121 yards, 3 INTs.\n• 24-of-43, 165 yards, 1 INT.\n• 14-of-29, 134 yards 1 TD.', 'PJ Walker: ', '• 18-of-34, 192 yards, 2 INTs.\n• 15-of-31, 248 yards, 1 TD, 2 INTs.', 'But after the Browns handed the ball off to a veteran quarterback, this is what the offense looked like under Flacco, including a wild-card loss to the Houston Texans.', '• 23-of-44, 254 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT.\n• 26-of-45, 311 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT.\n• 28-of-44, 374 yards, 2 TDs, 3 INTs.\n• 27-of-42, 368 yards, 3 TDs, 2 INT.\n• 19-of-29, 309 yards, 3 TDs 1 INT.\n• 34-of-46, 307 yards, 1 TD, 2 INTs.', 'On Sunday, we got yet another look at what a Browns offense looked like with a non-Watson veteran starter under center, with Jameis Winston making his first start of the season. This came against the Baltimore Ravens, a defense with a strong recent history that has fallen off a bit against the pass but is one of the better run-defending teams in the NFL. ', 'Winson’s stat line in the 29–24 victory: 27-of-41, 334 yards, 3 TDs and no interceptions.', 'Winston’s game marked the fourth time in a seven-game stretch with a veteran QB in this offense throwing for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns. The last time Watson did this was in a loss to the Tennessee Titans … back in January 2021, his final game as a member of the Houston Texans. ', 'If you’re a Browns fan preparing to complain this is overkill, or beating a dead horse, that is not my point. The Watson trade, along with the subsequent contract the Browns handed him, is absolutely and unequivocally the worst move in NFL history. And while it may be important to keep ringing that bell for the sake of history, so that no one forgets the team mortgaged its entire future for a player facing dozens of allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, and twisted itself into miniature yes-man pretzels defending him at every turn, the fact that this offense has been awesome without him can also be true. ', 'Patrick Mahomes does not have a single game of 300-plus yards and three touchdowns this year or last year. Tua Tagovailoa, piloting arguably the most explosive offense in the NFL a year ago, had three of those games in 2023. Josh Allen has 13 of those games … in his entire 101-game career. And a combination of Winston and Flacco have done it four times in about the span of time it takes someone to obtain a passport. ', 'Winston did it after the Browns had traded their best wide receiver (Amari Cooper) before the deadline. ', 'A few weeks ago, we dared Kevin Stefanski to bench Watson and force the Browns to pick a side. His patience with Watson, while confounding, seems to have only underlined the central point: When he has capable quarterback play, he is one of the best designers of an offense in the NFL. Last year, the team was white-hot when Stefanski was working alongside OC and quarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt. Now that Ken Dorsey has taken over play-calling duty, the Browns have again become one of the best passing offenses in the league.', 'While I am not as steeped in analytics as Cleveland’s front office claims to be, and the Browns’ front office may consider this an incomplete sample size or largely meaningless based on their own calculations as they venture deeper into the sunken cost fallacy, this week would seem to me another glaring example of why the team should simply sprint in the other direction. Allow Stefanski to pick his own quarterback while Watson stays home and collects a paycheck. Allow the team and the city a chance to take what was actually lovable about this franchise during a three-season stretch in which its Q rating rivaled that of an election-time telemarketer and step into the sunlight. Allow them to take the brutal dead cap hits while putting up 1990s Texas Tech numbers and get some of those exhausted, fed-up, disgusted, bleary-eyed fans back in their seats as they lobby to build a new stadium. Allow them to win, like the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers have won while sucking up the remnants of pricy contracts for quarterbacks no longer in the lineup. ', 'This has to sound better than the alternative. Stefanski and his offensive staff are now mounting a bulletproof case for a new direction by leaving the people above them who orchestrated the Watson trade with no choice.

The win marked the first time since Dec. 28 that the Browns topped 20 points in a game. "", ""With Deshaun Watson out for the season, the Browns turned to Jameis Winston, who diced up the Ravens defense for 334 yards, which is especially impressive when you consider that Watson didn't throw for 200 yards in any of his seven games this year before getting injured last week (his season-high was 196 yards).

It was his first game with three passing touchdowns and no interceptions since 2021.', 'Watson, on the other hand, had not thrown for over 196 yards in any of his starts this season.

It isn’t hard to put a finger on the problems in the Ravens’ secondary,https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/sports/ravens-nfl/ravens-secondary-browns-dropped-interceptions-X22UBJPKRVC63DM3OTM6GOYJ3I/,"['CLEVELAND — Despite a poor showing from almost every corner of the roster, the Ravens were up one point in the final minutes against the Cleveland Browns with an opportunity to put the game away.', 'All they needed was for safety Kyle Hamilton to catch the ball.', 'The young Pro Bowl safety has talked extensively about the secondary’s need to finish interceptions. He and his teammates worked on their hands at practice. When kickoff arrived, Hamilton played fast and physically and almost won two 50-50 balls. He made 10 tackles with a strip sack and two pass defenses.', 'But, with the game on the line, he reached out, grasped the ball with both hands, bobbled it and then lost it. And then the Ravens lost the game 29-24.', 'The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.', 'Hamilton was responsible for the worst drop, but safety Eddie Jackson was responsible for the most.', 'He dropped one in the end zone. He let a deep ball fly through his hands. He missed another interception while running into safety Ar’Darius Washington, who might have gotten there.', 'Maybe the Ravens would have found a way to lose no matter what. Or maybe, if they had made just one interception, the locker room would have been filled with smiles and laughter instead of somber silence.', 'The inability to catch has been a story all season, though it was at its worst in this game. The Ravens have made five interceptions this season. One was by a linebacker, Roquan Smith. The rest were by Marlon Humphrey, who didn’t play, although he has dropped an interception as well.', 'It’s an epidemic that’s a bit befuddling considering catching is a basic skill for NFL players, especially in skill positions, to have.', 'The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.', '“I mean, you can get on the JUGS [passing machine], but at the end of the day, we can all catch, you know what I’m saying?” Washington said. “So just block out all the noise, stop thinking about what’s going on and just focus on catching the ball.”', 'The solution is as “simple as that,” Jackson said.', '“We just got to make them [those plays],” Jackson said. “There’s no theory behind it. We’re just in a funk right now. We got to get out of it. Because a lot of those are big, game-changing plays if we make those.”', 'The secondary’s lack of hands was the most prominent issue, but its struggles go deeper. There have been communication breakdowns based on the body language of the players as they wave their arms and yell at each other. It’s something players have mentioned in locker room interviews over the season.', 'As a result, they’ve allowed quarterbacks to pass for 2,331 net yards, the most by any team in the league. That’s an average of 291 yards per game, and four quarterbacks have passed for over 300 yards against them. Two, Baker Mayfield and Jameis Winston, are not considered top-tier quarterbacks in the league.', 'The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.', 'Jackson said communication issues still popped up “here and there,” although that wasn’t the main thing in this game. Cornerback Brandon Stephens said the same, adding that the problem is execution at this point.', 'That was in spite of a shake-up in the secondary. Some of it was forced, with Humphrey out with a knee injury and cornerback Nate Wiggins out with an illness. Some of it was a choice — the Ravens replaced starting safety Marcus Williams with Washington, and coach John Harbaugh said after the game it did not have to do with Williams’ health.', '“It was a personnel decision,” Harbaugh said. “We’re kind of working through some things there. I feel very confident Marcus is going to be out there playing great football the rest of the season. I’ll just talk about it being an internal type of situation.”', 'As a result, the Ravens had to give cornerbacks Arthur Maulet and Jalyn Armour-Davis a significant amount of playing time in their first game back from injury. Maulet had said he wanted to help the team with communication. He declined an interview after the game, as did Hamilton, who did not make himself available.', 'What makes it all the more frustrating is that these players know they’re better than this. They have two Pro Bowlers in Humphrey and Hamilton. They’ve got Williams, who was at one point the highest-paid safety in the league, and Stephens, who had a breakout season last year. They’ve got seasoned veterans in Maulet and Jackson and young potential in Wiggins.', 'The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.', 'The secondary is the worst of the problems, but the entire defense isn’t playing up to what defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike said is the Ravens’ standard. Ahead of the Week 6 win over the Washington Commanders, Harbaugh said he told the group: “We were the 29th-ranked pass defense by statistics in the league — ‘Are we going to play 29th the rest of the year?’ That’s an opportunity, because we know we’re far better than that — we’re much more talented than that and we can play so much better.”', 'Two weeks later, there are still nine games to go, but the pressure is on. They can’t change the past — although Washington said it’s possible they’d be undefeated if the defense had held up its end — and Jackson said they need to take this one on the chin (“it sucks”) and move on. They need to figure out how to play to the Ravens’ standard.', '“We’re in the middle of the season right now, and so we’ve got to get back to doing what we do,” Washington said. “It’s kind of like an urgency right now, but just stay calm and everything like that. But it’s definitely urgent.”', 'And they need to put in even more work on the JUGS.', 'Giana Han', 'giana.han@thebaltimorebanner.com', 'Giana Han is a Ravens beat reporter from Howard County.', '', '© 2024 The Baltimore Banner.

Staff Reactions: Ravens lose to Browns due to key drops on offense and defense,https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2024/10/27/24281145/staff-reactions-ravens-lose-to-browns-due-to-key-drops-on-offense-and-defense,"['FILED UNDER:', 'Baltimore Beatdown Staff Reactions to the Ravens’ loss to the Cleveland Browns', 'The Baltimore Ravens, an offensive juggernaut over the past five weeks, suffer a painful loss to the Cleveland Browns, 29-24. Below are the reactions from the Beatdown staff.', 'Drops on offense. Drops on defense. Third down defense allows a conversion on eight of 15 plays. Ravens’ third-down offense converts on just two of 10 attempts. Truly the way the game unfolded as the offense could not convert and the defense failed to get off the field. No excuses for the defense being down a few players. The plays were literally in their hands to be made.', 'A lot of criticism will be hammered on safety Kyle Hamilton for dropping the game-winning interception. But Hamilton was the reason the defense ever got off the field in the first half, and generated the lone turnover for the defense which gave the Ravens life.', 'Offensively, drops were abundant. Bateman dropped a 3rd & 14 conversion that hit him directly in the facemask. Nelson Agholor dropped a key third down conversion, too. All of the plays were there to be made. They lacked the execution. They beat themselves, which is what we’ve said this season. The only team to beat Baltimore appears to be Baltimore.', 'This had all the makings of a loss. The Browns’ defense is good. The offense was no longer being held back by some of the worst quarterback play in history. The Ravens’ defense couldn’t generate pressure and as a result, they find themselves 5-3 on the season and looking to regroup yet again. — Kyle Phoenix', 'A hard-nosed, defensive AFC North first half gave way to an explosive second half with both offenses finding their rhythms. It’s never a good sign when the wide receivers and defensive backs combine for at least six drops, each one a major opportunity for the Ravens to swing the game back in their favor. Instead, they let the Browns hang around all game, with a shorthanded defensive line and secondary forcing Zach Orr to resort to heavy blitzing as the game progressed. — Nikhil Mehta', 'The Ravens literally let this game slip through their hands with inexcusable drops on both sides of the ball on plays that were immediately followed by a punt or disaster. On a day when their secondary was depleted at outside cornerback, their lone starter left standing gave up too many plays. The pressure was non-existent against an offensive line that had given up the most sacks and quarterback hits in the league by a mile. Jameis Winston gave the defense numerous opportunities to come up with game-shifting and sealing interceptions and the safeties failed to capitalize on any of them with the most crucial being the lollipop that All Pro Kyle Hamilton dropped on what was the game-winning drive. Offensively Lamar Jackson didn’t have his most efficient day with a handful of missed throws but he was let down time after time by his wide receivers who let accurate passes bounce off their hands and chest on several crucial third downs. Special teams weren’t exempt from blame as Justin Tucker missed a 50-yarder wide left and undrafted rookie running back Chris Collier was over-aggressive as a returner on several occasions where he failed to make it to the 30-yard line. There were a few instances where holds called on his teammates during those returns backed the offense up even more. This was a total team loss, there’s no way around it and there’s no reason it should’ve happened. Neither coordinator was in their bag as both made multiple head-scratching play calls that led to plays either not being made on offense or being given up on defense. — Joshua Reed', 'I don’t even know. Lamar Jackson made some special plays but wasn’t consistent enough the whole. Every single wide receiver had a critical drop at one moment. The defense barely got pressure on Winston. Multiple defensive backs dropped interceptions. I don’t know. Mystifying. Shouldn’t have happened. Todd Monken got too cute at times. Zach Orr’s defense continues to look lost at times while not making the plays when they are there. Multiple injuries happened today.', 'Division games are hard. Division games on the road are harder. Division games on the road with a brand new quarterback and a new play caller while missing your top two corners are even harder. But there’s simply no excuse for a “Super Bowl caliber-team”. Just ridiculous.', 'This will be way-overanalyzed. Zach Orr’s head will probably be called for. People will question the cute play calling from Monken. But if Kyle Hamilton catches that interception, it’s game. That simple. If receivers and backs had caught balls, it wouldn’t have been close. — Zach Canter', 'The Ravens certainly deserved to lose this game. The number of drops and missed opportunities made the ending more clear as the game went on. For as well as he played, Kyle Hamilton dropped the game winning interception which led to a Browns touchdown on the next play. Lamar Jackson wasn’t particularly sharp early in the game as the Ravens were on the lucky end of a few dropped interceptions. This game was eerily similar to the Steelers game roughly a year ago with the sheer number of drops on both sides of the ball. Nothing is given in the AFC North, and today once again proved that. — Stephen Bopst', '', '', 'Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.
