Opinion On political endorsement,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/,"['William Lewis is publisher and chief executive officer of The Washington Post.', 'The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.', 'As our Editorial Board wrote in 1960:', '“The Washington Post has not ‘endorsed’ either candidate in the presidential campaign. That is in our tradition and accords with our action in five of the last six elections. The unusual circumstances of the 1952 election led us to make an exception when we endorsed General Eisenhower prior to the nominating conventions and reiterated our endorsement during the campaign. In the light of hindsight we retain the view that the arguments for his nomination and election were compelling. But hindsight also has convinced us that it might have been wiser for an independent newspaper in the Nation’s Capital to have avoided formal endorsement.”', 'The Editorial Board made two other points — ahead of an election that John F. Kennedy won — that will resonate with readers today:', '“The election of 1960 is certainly as important as any held in this century. This newspaper is in no sense noncommittal about the challenges that face the country. As our readers will be aware, we have attempted to make clear in editorials our conviction that most of the time one of the two candidates has shown a deeper understanding of the issues and a larger capacity for leadership.”', 'However, it concluded:', '“We nevertheless adhere to our tradition of non-endorsement in this presidential election. We have said and will continue to say, as reasonably and candidly as we know how, what we believe about the emerging issues of the campaign. We have sought to arrive at our opinions as fairly as possible, with the guidance of our own principles of independence but free of commitment to any party or candidate.”', 'And again in 1972, the Editorial Board posed and then answered this critical question ahead of an election which President Richard M. Nixon won: “In talking about the choice of a President of the United States, what is a newspaper’s proper role? … Our own answer is that we are, as our masthead proclaims, an independent newspaper, and that with one exception (our support of President Eisenhower in 1952), it has not been our tradition to bestow formal endorsement upon presidential candidates. We can think of no reason to depart from that tradition this year.”', 'Follow Opinions on the news', 'That was strong reasoning, but in 1976 for understandable reasons at the time, we changed this long-standing policy and endorsed Jimmy Carter as president. But we had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to.', 'We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions — whom to vote for as the next president.', 'Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom nonpartisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds.', 'Most of all, our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent.', 'And that is what we are and will be.', 'Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

We believe that this is how you save democracy. With the little platoons of a community.', 'If you want a media organization like this to exist in the world, you have to be part of it. This is the time. Come ride with us.', 'I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE THE DAY when the Washington Post would kneel before Donald Trump.', 'These are not Senate Republicans or conservative donors. This is not a group of people who cower in the face of authoritarianism. The Post editorial board, the writers who write anonymous opinion essays in the name of the paper itself, is a group of bold, pro-democracy intellectuals who have traditionally taken—individually and collectively—courageous stands about democracy and human rights around the world.', 'The Post’s editorial page is also the institution in which I grew up professionally. I worked there for nearly a decade under both of the last two long-time editorial page editors, Fred Hiatt and Meg Greenfield. It is an institution I revere.', 'And it is one that has not previously wavered with respect to Trumpist authoritarianism.', 'Yet today we learn that the editorial board has been stripped of its authority to endorse presidential candidates, having previously decided to endorse Kamala Harris. Instead, the paper announced in a statement from the publisher, William Lewis, that “The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.”', 'It is, of course, a clever maneuver. The Post is not National Review, which in its famous “Against Trump” issue in January 2016 declared that “Trump is a philosophically unmoored political opportunist who would trash the broad conservative ideological consensus within the GOP in favor of a free-floating populism with strong-man overtones”—only to endorse him that same October.', 'Indeed, the Post kneels without offering a word of praise for Trump. It’s just that, for high-minded reasons that it doesn’t really bother to specify, it’s getting out of this whole presidential endorsement business altogether. That was its traditional position, it archly informs us, back in the good old days before Watergate sent the Post on an aberrant jag. And, you see, while it’s perfectly understandable why the Post betrayed its high-minded above-it-allness in the wake of Nixon—when emotions were running high and all—having thought about it, it’s time to once again remove ourselves to the heights of Olympus where we can peer down on the foibles of mortals:', 'We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions—whom to vote for as the next president.', 'Yet it is a submission nonetheless: One week before the mortals finish voting and might elect an authoritarian, one whose former chief of staff calls him a fascist, the Washington Post has decided that silence is the best way to guide its readers.', 'Silence, after all, will not offend the authoritarian should he win. Silence, after all, is more than Trump can reasonably expect from the Post. Democracy may die in darkness, as the Post’s motto goes, but silence is apparently a good hedge.', 'Our country needs pro-democracy institutions now more than ever. The Bulwark is the best pro-democracy community on the internet, and we’re growing. Join us.', 'I HAVE FIVE THINGS TO SAY about what has happened.', 'First, the Washington Post editorial page staff did not choose to kneel. The Columbia Journalism Review reports that:', 'Over a period of several weeks, a Post staffer told me, two Post board members, Charles Lane and Stephen W. Stromberg, had worked on drafts of a Harris endorsement. (Neither was contacted for this article.) “Normally we’d have had a meeting, review a draft, make suggestions, do editing,” the staffer told me. Editorial writers started to feel angsty a few weeks ago, per the staffer; the process stalled. Around a week ago, editorial page editor David Shipley told the editorial board that the endorsement was on track, adding that “this is obviously something our owner has an interest in.”', '“We thought we were dickering over language—not over whether there would be an endorsement,” the Post staffer said. So the Post, both news and opinion departments, were stunned Friday after Shipley told the editorial board at a meeting that it would not take a position after all. This represents the first time the Post has sat out a presidential endorsement since 1988.', 'The Washington Post Guild also posted a statement expressing concern that “management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial” and the decision to forgo the already-drafted endorsement “undercuts [their] work.”', 'This is a failure not of the Post editorial board but of ownership towards the board. I do not want to ascribe motive to the Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, whom I do not know and to whom I have not spoken about this matter. I content myself with observing that Trump spent a lot of time attacking Bezos and Amazon during his first term over Washington Post content and that he has more recently become cozy with Elon Musk, with whom Amazon competes in a number of areas. ', 'A cautious businessman in Bezos’s position may not be eager to have his newspaper poke the bear just before the bear comes back to power. A cautious businessman in Bezos’s position might be concerned that the bear will remember—and he would surely be right. A cautious businessman might make the judgment that a newspaper he bought with $250 million of his pocket change should not be allowed to yap its way into fucking up his myriad other business interests of much greater value, some of which may depend on the goodwill of the president of the United States.', 'All fair points. But such a cautious businessman should then choose a different hobby. Owning the Washington Post is, among other things, a sacred trust. And that trust has historically involved supervising a little think tank called the Washington Post editorial page—and treasuring and protecting its autonomy.', 'When Fred Hiatt died, I wrote a piece about him in which I went out of my way to note the unusual role of Donald Graham—who was the controlling owner of the paper until selling to Bezos in 2013—in cultivating the page’s excellence and independence:', 'To give you an idea of the extreme of what this looked like, I once witnessed an argument between Don and my late colleague Peter Milius on a policy issue on which the two had long-standing and irreconcilable conflict. Don could, of course, have won the argument by fiat. It was his newspaper, after all. But Don would never do that. His mode of leadership was to hire Fred to run the editorial page and then let him do it. So Don made his case, and Peter fired back. And they went at it, to everyone’s discomfort.', 'Eventually, Fred and the board agreed with Peter who, having raised voices with Don over the matter, proceeded to write an editorial reflecting his own views of the matter. And Don responded with a handwritten note the next day saying he could not be prouder to have editorial writers who would stand up to him and do what Peter did—and also that Peter was dead wrong.', 'If you’re not prepared to defer to the editorial board you have hired to think things through for you, you have no business owning the Washington Post.', 'Share', 'SECOND, IT WILL NOT DO TO HARKEN BACK to the Post’s supposed tradition of not endorsing. It’s a clever rhetorical strategy, I suppose, but to anyone who knows the institution and its history, it’s pretty dumb. The Post before Nixon was a bit of a backwater. It was small, privately held. It had not yet become a national voice. It had not yet benefited from the collapse of the other major Washington newspaper. The traditions of the Washington Postare the traditions of the Washington Postof the Pentagon Papers and Watergate era and the subsequent decades.', 'And one of those traditions was this innovative idea that the newspaper should house one of the finest think tanks in Washington to help its readers think through the hard questions we face as a polity. This think tank would publish anonymously on the left-hand column of the opinion pages. It would be composed of writers who might be giants in their other lives but who would gather around a table and work collectively in this one. When I was there, I sat in a row with Hiatt, Anne Applebaum, Ruth Marcus, Sebastian Mallaby, Chuck Lane, Jackson Diehl and many others. It was a truly awesome assembly of talent—one you simply cannot maintain if you tell people they are not allowed to endorse in a race that pits decency against evil. Already today, Robert Kagan—one of the Post’s finest opinion writers—has resigned. ', 'To be sure, the Post was one of the only newspapers in the country that truly worked this way. But that is the tradition this decision obliterates.', 'THIRD, DAVID SHIPLEY, THE PAPER’S current opinions editor—with whom I have had a cordial but not close relationship for many years—is differently situated from the rest of the editorial page staff in this episode. It is unclear from the CJR account precisely what his role in this debacle was: whether he too had the rug pulled out from under him after attempting to do the right thing, or whether he was in some way complicit. I do not want to make assumptions.', 'If this was done against his will, he needs to resign in protest. It is the singular job of the editorial page editor to absorb all of the political pressure from the ownership such that the page functions as it is meant to.', 'If the ownership chooses to vandalize the institution, there is ultimately nothing the editorial page editor can do about that. But he doesn’t have to lend his name to it, either. It mattered a lot that Hiatt’s and Greenfield’s names were on the Washington Post’s masthead. And if Shipley lends his name to the vandalism, he becomes party to it even if he played a wholly honorable role.', 'Conversely, if Shipley played a willing role in this episode, he need not resign. If this is the case, then he has helped turn the editorial page into something less elevated than it has been for the past fifty years. And his name will come to represent the new era in which the Post is, well, just like any other newspaper run by a rich guy who keeps an eye on his external business interests. He may as well continue to lead it.', 'Share', 'FOURTH, THE WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE that Bezos has desecrated was a formative institution for me. It valued political pluralism, modeled democratic dialogue and consensus, and wasn’t afraid to take costs and consequences seriously. I wrote at the time of Hiatt’s death about the impact of the Post editorial page on the site that I built, Lawfare:', 'We tried to build a site in which it was okay to infuriate some people with defenses of surveillance authorities and drone strikes and infuriate other people with an insistence on democratic norms and the critical importance of managing an out-of-control presidency. In so many ways, the mood of what we have tried to build at Lawfare is, as Clausewitz might have said, the continuation of the Washington Post Editorial Page by other means. It was, and is, an attempt to take that mood of civil but fierce independence and rigor and apply it to a different set of problems and a different style of writing.', 'When an institution like this can no longer be counted on to distinguish good from evil—or what is tolerable from what is evil—democracy suffers a loss. Will it affect the results of the election? Almost certainly not. But it is a spiritual injury, another institution that for oh-so-many reasons just can’t be troubled to speak honestly about our situation. And this institution had stood so bravely for the rule of law against the predations of multiple American presidents.', 'FIFTH, AND FINALLY, IF EVER THERE WERE an incident that stands for the proposition that democracy, and journalism, cannot rest on the shoulders of oligarchs, this is it. Bezos did a lot of good for the Post when he first took it over, but the consent of the billionaire is not a stable structure for newspapers or magazines in an authoritarian era. Eventually, they can be counted upon to protect themselves, and that may sometimes mean not speaking the truth—either by lying or, as here, just by not speaking at all. I have no solution to the problem of media financing, save to note that my own publication funds itself on a nonprofit model that eschews overdependence on any one funder. In an era when a fundamental role of journalism may be robust dissent, financing dissent is going to be a challenge.', 'Don’t look to Jeff Bezos to meet it.', 'Share', 'Ready for more?']"

I had him as a Frosted Flake,” she later recalled.', 'The decision by the Post to forego a political endorsement comes days after the Los Angeles Times made a similar decision. In both cases, the decision has caused newsroom uproar, resignations and canceled subscriptions.', 'Former Washington Post editor Marty Baron criticized Bezos’s decision as “cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty”. Baron said it was an invitation for Trump to “further intimidate” the media after threatening to exact retribution against all who opposed him if he returns to power.', 'Baron later noted that the paper’s editorial board had expressed opinions of US House and Senate races “but if they think readers can make up their own minds, then sure … maybe they should decide just not to run editorials at all”.', '“If their philosophy is that readers can make up their own minds on big issues they face in this democracy, then don’t run any editorials,” Baron said on CNN. “But the fact is they decided not to run editorials in this one instance, 11 days before an election.”', 'Sign up to Headlines US', 'Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning', '', 'The Associated Press reported that Trump briefly met with executives of Bezos’s space exploration company Blue Origin on Friday after his newspaper had spiked its endorsement of Harris.', 'The Columbia Journalism Review said the Post’s decision not to make an endorsement amounted to what Yale University history professor Timothy Snyder termed “anticipatory obedience”.', 'Bezos’s Post adopted the “Democracy Dies in Darkness” slogan in 2017.

Both major news organizations, each owned by a billionaire, announced this week that their editorial boards would not make a presidential endorsement, despite their decades-long traditions of doing so.', 'There’s no other way to see this other than as an appalling display of cowardice and a dereliction of their public duty.', 'At the Los Angeles Times, the decision rests clearly with Patrick Soon-Shiong, who bought the ailing paper in 2018, raising great hopes of a resurgence there.', 'At the Post (where I was the media columnist from 2016 to 2022), the editorial page editor David Shipley said he owned the decision, but it clearly came from above – specifically from the publisher, Will Lewis, the veteran of Rupert Murdoch’s media properties, hand-picked last year by the paper’s owner, Jeff Bezos. Was Bezos himself the author of this abhorrent decision? Maybe not, but it could not have come as a surprise.', 'All of this may look like nonpartisan neutrality, or be intended to, but it’s far from that. For one thing, it’s a shameful smackdown of both papers’ reporting and opinion-writing staffs who have done important work exposing Trump’s dangers for many years.', 'It’s also a strong statement of preference. The papers’ leaders have made it clear that they either want Trump (who is, after all, a boon to large personal fortunes) or that they don’t wish to risk the ex-president’s wrath and retribution if he wins. If the latter was a factor, it’s based on a shortsighted judgment, since Trump has been a hazard to press rights and would only be emboldened in a second term.', '“Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage,” the wrote former Washington Post editor Marty Baron on Friday on X, blasting the Post’s decision.

Analysis: The real problem with the Washington Post and L.A. Times endorsement decisions,https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/newspaper-endorsements-19863462.php,"['The publishers of the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post announced this week they would not be endorsing a candidate in the upcoming presidential race.', 'The announcements from two of the country’s most consequential news sources that they would not be endorsing in this year’s presidential race was met with immediate outrage by many, but another kind of reaction surfaced as well: skepticism.', 'Journalists are a naturally skeptical bunch, but you don’t have to be a professional to be wary of the explanations provided by the publishers of the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post this week for their eleventh hour decisions.', 'The Times’ billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, responded to the swift backlash by trying to volley the blame back onto the paper’s editorial board. ', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Article continues below this ad', '“The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation,” he wrote in a statement Wednesday. “In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years. In this way, with this clear and non-partisan information side-by-side, our readers could decide who would be worthy of being President for the next four years. Instead of adopting this path as suggested, the Editorial Board chose to remain silent and I accepted their decision.”', 'There are quite a few red flags here, but let’s start with the obvious: What Soon-Shiong is describing might sound like a useful piece of journalism — it has unobjectionable words like “factual analysis” and “nonpartisan” — but it is unequivocally not an editorial, and particularly not an endorsement.', 'The entire purpose of an endorsement is to take a strong stand in favor of an issue or candidate, and to back up that stand with facts and analysis that could persuade someone to reach the same conclusion. Saying the editorial board was offered the chance to provide a nonpartisan analysis is a bit like saying Taco Bell workers were offered the chance to sell customers cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers are great, but that’s not why one goes to Taco Bell.', 'Readers are understandably confused at times about the distinctions between a paper’s editorial board, which provides opinionated analysis, and its news reporters, who seek to report and reveal facts without taking a stand in favor of a candidate. It’s possible Soon-Shiong is similarly confused, though it’s far likelier that he’s well aware of his own editorial board’s job, and is instead banking on readers’ confusion to offer an explanation that appears reasonable on its face.', 'The L.A. Times Guild Unit Council & Bargaining Committee condemned not just the decision itself, but also Soon-Shiong’s explanation.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Article continues below this ad', '“We are even more concerned that he is now unfairly assigning blame to Editorial Board members for his decision not to endorse,” the guild said in a statement. “We are still pressing for answers from newsroom management on behalf of our members.”', 'In his announcement Friday that the paper would not be endorsing a presidential candidate, Washington Post publisher Will Lewis said the decision meant the paper was returning to its roots. He quoted reasoning that was offered by the paper’s editorial board in 1960 and 1972 — though most of the statements presented simply attribute the decision not to endorse to tradition, rather than making a compelling case against endorsing.', 'Again, the paper’s journalists cried foul: “We are deeply concerned that The Washington Post — an American news institution in the nation’s capital — would make the decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election,” the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement. “The role of an Editorial Board is to do just this: to share opinions on the news impacting our society and culture and endorse candidates to help guide readers. The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis — not from the Editorial Board itself — makes us concerned that management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial.”', 'Indeed, in both cases, the editorial boards were already deep into the process of preparing their endorsements when the decision to stay neutral was made.', 'The Los Angeles Times’ editorial director, Mariel Garza, told the Columbia Journalism Review that she had already drafted an outline of a Kamala Harris endorsement when she was told the board would not be taking a position in the race.

The timing of both papers’ decisions clearly indicates that it wasn’t the idea of endorsing a candidate that the publishers rejected, it was the plans to back Harris that prompted both papers’ sudden and surprising stances.', 'Ultimately, editorial boards answer to a newspaper’s publisher. Those publishers are well within their rights to decide not to make an endorsement in the presidential race, or any other contest.', '“The First Amendment protects people’s right to use their own property to speak or to publish,” conservative legal scholar Eugene Volokh told Los Angeles magazine this week. “That means that it’s ultimately up to newspaper and magazine owners to decide what goes into their publications.”', 'But the most fundamental definition of a newspaper’s role is to provide its readers with the facts. And in both the case of the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, the publishers’ reasoning doesn’t pass that test.', 'If they’re worried about retaliation over a Harris endorsement from a future President Donald Trump, then saying so would be a reader service in itself.', 'Or, if the reason behind the non-endorsements is that these owners actually do support Trump and want to deny Harris any advantage an endorsement might provide, they should have the courage to say so clearly.', 'Meanwhile, other newspapers have seized on the uproar to roll out their endorsements.

The Post's humor writer, Alexandra Petri, ended up using her column to endorse Harris after the fact."", 'The Post editor-at-large Robert Kagan and opinion columnist Michele Norris publicly resigned in response to the non-endorsement, and a wave of subscription cancellations followed.', 'At the L.A.

However, several board members openly disputed this, asserting they had prepared an endorsement for Harris that was ultimately blocked by Soon-Shiong.

Critics contend that they can amplify perceptions of bias and partisanship, potentially alienating segments of a paper’s readership.', 'As a result, many publications have opted out of endorsements entirely.', 'In 2022, for example, over 200 outlets owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, including the Chicago Tribune and Denver Post, announced they would cease endorsing major political candidates, citing public discourse and the prevalence of “culture wars.”', 'Similarly, the New York Times stated earlier this year that it would stop endorsing candidates in state races, although it would continue backing U.S. presidential candidates. The Minnesota Star Tribune followed suit in August, choosing not to endorse candidates or causes in 2024, pledging instead to offer robust analysis to help readers make informed decisions.', 'The decisions by the Post and L.A.

Times journalists Robert Greene and Karin Klein also stepped down in protest, with Greene sharing a statement with the Columbia Journalism Review explaining that the paper’s decision “hurt particularly because one of the candidates, Donald Trump, has demonstrated such hostility to principles that are central to journalism — respect for the truth and reverence for democracy.”', 'In a statement shared on Facebook, Klein stressed that Soon-Shiong “blocked our voice” when he decided to scrap the editorial team’s endorsement of Harris.', ""On Saturday, Patrick Soon-Shiong's daughter, Nika Soon-Shiong, told the New York Times that her father’s decision not to endorse Vice President Harris was driven by Harris’s support for Israel’s military actions in Gaza."", '“Our family made the joint decision not to endorse a Presidential candidate. This was the first and only time I have been involved in the process,” she said. “As a citizen of a country openly financing genocide, and as a family that experienced South African Apartheid, the endorsement was an opportunity to repudiate justifications for the widespread targeting of journalists and ongoing war on children.”', 'Patrick Soon-Shiong, who purchased the Times in 2018 for $500 million, later refuted her comments, telling CNN that his daughter ""speaks in her own personal capacity.""', '“She does not have any role at the LA Times, nor does she participate in any decision or discussion with the editorial board, as has been made clear many times,” he said.', 'The guild that represents many L.A. Times employees acknowledged that readers have threatened to cancel their subscriptions, while pleading with them not to abandon the publication that pays their salaries.', '“Before you hit the ‘cancel’ button: That subscription underwrites the salaries of hundreds of journalists in our newsroom,” the statement said. “Our member-journalists work every day to keep readers informed during these tumultuous times.

Thousands of other readers have reportedly followed suit.', 'Some journalists argue that these non-endorsements prioritize the interests of the papers’ billionaire owners — Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong — over their readers, suggesting they are motivated by a desire to avoid backlash from Donald Trump if he wins the presidency.', 'Kagan highlighted this perceived conflict of interest in an interview with CNN.', '“This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump,” he said. “Trump has threatened to go after Bezos’ business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with the federal government. They depend on the federal government.”', 'As of Sunday, Oct. 27, Bezos has yet to respond publicly to the outcry.', 'While some papers have stepped back from the practice, others remain committed to endorsing candidates.', 'As of Sunday, Oct. 27, the New York Times, Boston Globe, Seattle Times, Las Vegas Sun and the New Yorker have endorsed Harris.', 'Meanwhile, Trump has received backing from the New York Post, the Washington Times and the Las Vegas Review-Journal.']"

Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960. Nixon would later be implicated in the Watergate scandal, which generated 69 indictments and 48 criminal convictions in one of the biggest political corruption scandals in American history.', '“We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility,” Lewis wrote. (It is unclear who the “we” is here. Lewis? Lewis and Bezos? Some secret third group?) “That is inevitable. We don’t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.”', 'This is now the second American newspaper, after The Los Angeles Times, to kill a Harris endorsement at the owner’s behest.

Soon-Shiong’s decision to block the paper from endorsing California’s own Kamala Harris for president, as its board was reportedly planning to do, led to Donald Trump crowing and the paper’s editorials editor quitting. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Mariel Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.” Two more members of the newspaper's editorial board resigned after Garza did."", 'At The Washington Post, the world’s third-richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, is The Man.

Nor in any future presidential election,” Lewis wrote on the newspaper’s website Friday. “We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.” The newspaper, Lewis writes, didn’t endorse in presidential races from 1960 to 1972 but did from 1976 to 2020.', ' ', 'The newspaper endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. It endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, but almost three months before that, it had declared Trump “a unique threat to American democracy.” As The Washington Post did, from 2008 to 2020, the L.A. Times endorsed Barack Obama twice and then Clinton and Biden. Importantly, the L.A. Times endorsed Harris in 2014 when she was the state’s attorney general running for re-election and then endorsed her successful 2016 U.S. Senate run.', 'To Garza’s point, the stakes are high in this election, at least for people who aren’t billionaires. And we have to consider the possibilities that the leaders of these newspapers are OK with Trump — or terrified of him. Given the size and influence of these papers, neither of those possibilities is comforting. On X, Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post who was in charge when the paper adopted “Democracy Dies in Darkness” as its slogan, responded to Lewis’ piece: “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.” He said Trump “will see this as invitation to further intimidate” Bezos, and he called it “Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.”', 'According to a Washington Post story about the nonendorsement that cited two sources briefed on the events, “The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.”', 'It certainly appears that Soon-Shiong and Bezos are less concerned with their newspaper’s duty to the public and to history and more worried about what might happen to them if Trump wins and carries out his plans of retribution.', 'As important as it is to save newspapers, an obvious downside of billionaires coming to the rescue is their influence on those publications and their editorial pages.

She lost. Not the popular vote, of course, but, still, she lost.', 'What’s striking is that in 2020, there were almost as many of those newspapers that didn’t endorse (44) as the 47 that endorsed the eventual winner, Biden. (Trump received seven endorsements that time.) There are likely multiple reasons for smaller newspapers declining to endorse, including public assumptions that endorsements govern news coverage and the anger that such endorsements inevitably cause.', 'It is far more likely that a newspaper subscriber will cancel their subscription if the paper endorses the candidate they oppose than it is that someone who doesn’t subscribe will become a reader because their candidate was endorsed. It’s a high-risk/no-reward proposition. But it’s still something newspapers do, and if other owners and publishers can take the risks, then billionaires certainly can.', ' ', 'Soon-Shiong posted a comment on X Wednesday that mischaracterizes what editorials boards do:', 'The Editorial Board was provided the opportunity to draft a factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House, and how these policies affected the nation. In addition, the Board was asked to provide their understanding of the policies and plans enunciated by the candidates during this campaign and its potential effect on the nation in the next four years.

However, Tackett reports that McConnell had leaned towards voting to convict at certain points.', '“I’m not at all conflicted about whether what the president did is an impeachable offense. I think it is. Urging an insurrection and people attacking the Capitol as a direct result … is about as close to an impeachable offense as you can imagine, with the possible exception of maybe being an agent for another country,” said McConnell.', '“I don’t know whether you can make a conclusive argument that he’s directly responsible for them storming the Capitol, but I think it’s not in dispute that those folks would not have been here in the first place if he had not asked them to come and to disrupt the actual acceptance of the outcome of the election,” the Senate GOP leader said.', 'The Kentucky Republican did not mince words, calling Trump a “sleazeball,” a “narcissist” and saying that the former president is “stupid as well as being ill-tempered.” He added that Trump is “not very smart, irascible, nasty, just about every quality you would not want somebody to have.”', 'While he dismissed Trump’s attacks against him, saying “every time he takes a shot at me, I think it’s good for my reputation,” he added that the former president’s attacks on his wife, Elaine Chao, Trump’s former Transportation Secretary, went too far.', 'In 2022, Trump referred to Chao as McConnell’s “China loving wife, Coco Chow” in a post on Truth Social. Tackett reports that Chao was “deeply disturbed” by the comments, and McConnell said that his wife is “not used to taking a punch.”', 'Tackett also reports that McConnell cried while addressing his staff in the hours after the attack on the Capitol. “You are my staff, and you are my responsibility,” he told them. “You are my family, and I hate the fact that you had to go through this.”', 'He called the rioters who entered the Senate chamber, “narcissistic, just like Donald Trump, sitting in the vice president’s chair taking pictures of themselves,” adding it was a “shocking occurrence and further evidence of Donald Trump’s complete unfitness for office.”', 'In a statement to CNN about his comments on the former president in the book, McConnell said, “Whatever I may have said about President Trump pales in comparison to what JD Vance, Lindsey Graham, and others have said about him, but we are all on the same team now.”', 'The Senate GOP leader and the former president have long had a rocky relationship, which Tackett details in the book. However, McConnell has endorsed Trump, and met with him back in June of this year during Trump’s meeting with Senate Republicans off the Hill.', 'McConnell did not restrict his comments in the biography to the former president. He also criticized Sen. Rick Scott, who led the Senate Republicans’ campaign committee during the 2022 midterms and proposed a highly controversial policy plan that was criticized by both parties, before unsuccessfully challenging McConnell for Senate GOP leader. Scott has announced he is running for leader again this year, though this time he will not be challenging McConnell, who will be stepping down from his leadership post.', '“I don’t think Rick makes a very good victim,” quipped McConnell. “I think he did a poor job of running the (Senate campaign) committee. His plan was used by the Democrats against our candidates as late as the last weekend (before the election). He promoted the fiction that we were in the middle of a big sweep when there was no tangible evidence of it. And I think his campaign against me was some kind of ill-fated effort to turn the attention away from him and on to somebody else.”', 'McConnell will remain in his role as Senate GOP leader through the end of the year until the start of the new Congress in early January.', 'The Kentucky Republican, who has previously said he is most proud of his legacy in shaping the Supreme Court and leading the efforts to confirm three new conservative justices during Trump’s presidency, acknowledged that Justice Clarence Thomas “exercised pretty questionable judgment,” when he chose to accept trips from a major GOP donor. “But then again, I’m not sure what the rules are,” he added.', 'In April 2023, when asked about reports on the trips, McConnell accused Democratic senators of launching political attacks on Thomas. “The Supreme Court and the court system is a whole separate part of our Constitution,” he said. “And the Democrats, it seems to me, spend a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution.”', 'McConnell has previously praised Thomas’ judgment and his work on the Court. “I have total confidence in Justice Thomas’s impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court,” he said on the Senate floor in 2022, before the reports of Thomas’s travel came to light.', 'McConnell also expressed support for special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump’s actions around the 2020 election and the insurrection. “I think it was the single most – in a category by itself – of how wrong all of it was and there’s no doubt who inspired it, and I just hope that he’ll have to pay a price for it,” said McConnell. “If he hasn’t committed indictable offenses, I don’t know what one is.”', 'CNN’s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

That choice was made not by the paper’s editorial board or newsroom leadership, the Post (and others) reported, citing anonymous sources, but by its owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.', 'Bezos, as it happens, has billions of dollars in contracts before the federal government. It did not take long for people to start suggesting that the decision not to endorse might have had little to do with journalistic principle and much to do with the relationship between Bezos and the famously vindictive person who, if elected president of the United States, could soon have major influence over his businesses. “This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,” Martin Baron, a former Post executive editor, told NPR. “Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” (Bezos has not commented on the endorsement decision. The Post’s communications chief told the paper’s reporters, “This was a Washington Post decision to not endorse.”)', 'Average people have few ways of combatting forces bigger than them, forces such as the threat of authoritarianism, the boiling-frog encroachment on free expression, and the near-unchecked power of the ultrarich. But consumer choice is one thing they do have. And in the hours immediately after the non-endorsement was made public, Post readers pulled the lever they knew to pull, the lever they have been pulling roughly as long as newspapers have existed: They canceled their subscriptions. As Max Tani reported in Semafor, relying on accounts from anonymous sources, “in the 24 hours ending Friday afternoon, about 2,000 subscribers canceled their subscriptions.” (In the same article, Tani quoted a source saying that the number of canceled subscriptions was “not statistically significant.”) NPR, citing internal Post correspondence, reported that “more than 1,600 digital subscriptions had been cancelled less than four hours after the news broke.”', 'It was a reasonable impulse. But if Bezos is indeed why the Post is no longer endorsing candidates, and if people are worried about his outsize influence on our society, they should not be canceling their newspaper subscriptions. They should be canceling their Amazon Prime subscriptions.', 'Amazon is the biggest store in the world, the second-largest private employer in the United States, and the reason Bezos was rich enough to buy the Post in the first place. And Amazon, as I have previously reported, is powered by Prime, which in and of itself generates tremendous revenue for the company, in addition to facilitating ever more shopping. Last year, the company’s revenue from its membership offerings alone came to $40.2 billion. This is roughly twice as much as the 2022 revenue of every publicly traded newspaper company in the country combined, and infinitely more than that of the Post, which in May reported that it had lost $77 million in the past year, largely as a result of declining paid readership. The United States has roughly 127 million households. Recent estimates show that U.S. consumers hold 180 million Prime subscriptions and fewer than 21 million newspaper subscriptions.', 'Amazon Prime subscriptions pay for Amazon to grow—to gobble up market share, put small stores out of business, and make Bezos more powerful. Newspaper subscriptions, by the same token, pay for newspapers to grow. They pay for reporting and editing and fact-checking and the skilled labor of a vanishing class of people—people dedicated to the careful work of gathering the news, verifying the accuracy of information, and endeavoring to ensure a well-informed citizenry. The people who do that work are not the ones responsible for killing the Post’s endorsement. But they are the ones who are likely to be laid off, furloughed, bought out, or underpaid if company revenue dwindles as a result of subscription cancellations.', 'More Stories', 'The Most Miraculous—And Overlooked—Type of Milk', 'Goodbye, Coliseum', '']"

The paper that’s long dined out on its reputation as a principled foe of a paranoid, authoritarian Republican regime announced on Friday that it wasn’t going to endorse a presidential candidate this time out (or indeed ever again), even though the twice-impeached, criminally convicted Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon look like a mere piker in the realm of unhinged abuses of maximum executive power.', 'The newspaper that still has the temerity to envision itself as a heroic guardian of the country’s embattled democracy rolled over for the MAGA thugocracy under the flimsiest imaginable pretext: It intends to safeguard an “independent space” for voters who don’t want to be told whom to vote for, editorial-page editor David Shipley reportedly told outraged staffers of the paper in what NPR media reporter David Folfenflik called a “tense meeting.” Never mind that Americans are already told whom to vote for on a never-ending loop in every imaginable public venue, and seem to emerge with their delicate sensibilities intact. Never mind that the whole idea of an op-ed section is to assemble voices arguing over what people should say and do. And never mind that there’s no such thing as an impartial “independent space” in a battle over how and whether America’s formal democracy can continue. What Shipley was actually doing was saying, “My corporate paymasters want to wallow in Donald Trump’s tax cuts and avoid jeopardizing their lucrative federal contracts,” but the phony rhetoric of noncommittal journalistic objectivity is far better suited to newsroom meetings where you’re trying to get reporters to toe the management line.', 'Shipley had reportedly already drafted an endorsement of Harris, but per the Post’s own reporting, it was overruled by Post owner and retail predator Jeff Bezos, the centibillionaire owner of Amazon. During Trump’s first administration, the then-president threatened to withhold key tax breaks and postal subventions in retaliation for the Post’s critical coverage of Trump. When the editorial board weighed its 2020 endorsement, Bezos approved its choice of Joe Biden; this time out, the paper’s owner is hedging his bets against economic penalties in a second Trump term, to say nothing of the resolution of several pending antitrust actions against his company unlikely to break his way in a Harris administration. And like his fellow billionaires, King Amazon is clearly warming to the prospects of more pelf in his coffers thanks to Trump’s pledge to continue lavishing giveaways on our economic oligarchy.', 'It’s worth noting that the same scenario played out at the Los Angeles Times, where its billionaire owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, blocked the paper’s planned endorsement of Harris. In addition to being a standard-issue plutocrat with a pharmaceutical fortune sure to prosper under a more lax Trump-appointed FDA, Soon-Shiong is a longtime pal of Elon Musk, the man-child centibillionaire who’s gone all in on Trump’s reelection. (Indeed, in a fine irony, the Post published a front-page account of how Musk’s Starlink satellite company stands to rake in billions more in government dosh in a second Trump term, on the very day the paper’s managers announced their craven capitulation to Musk’s would-be benefactor.)', 'What’s different about the shameful LA Times saga is that the paper’s editorial-pages editor, Marial Garza, recognized the actual  journalistic and political stakes of having the paper’s voice squelched by a billionaire’s diktat. “I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,” Garza told Columbia Journalism Review editor Sewell Chan:', 'In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.… This is a point in time where you speak your conscience no matter what. And an endorsement was the logical next step after a series of editorials we’ve been writing about how dangerous Trump is to democracy, about his unfitness to be president, about his threats to jail his enemies. We have made the case in editorial after editorial that he shouldn’t be reelected.', 'As for David Shipley, here’s the brutal assessment of one Post employee: “The story about Shipley has long been that he got the job because he knows how to get along with rich men.” Jacob Heilbrunn, a former colleague of Shipley’s at The New Republic, concurs: Back then, he was “earnest, conventionally liberal,” but “now seems to have morphed into a total empty suit.”', 'Indeed, while Shipley said he “owned” the Post’s cowardly decision in that heated staff meeting, the official rationale for it was published under the byline of Bezos’s handpicked publisher, Will Lewis, the former Murdoch lackey still neck-deep in the fallout from Britain’s phone-hacking scandal.', 'In an arrogant and obtuse editorial, Lewis waved away the paper’s recent history of presidential endorsements by citing its non-endorsement in the 1960 presidential race—a statement of putative journalistic principle that chiefly succeeded in being weaselly and pompous in equal measure: “We have said and will continue to say, as reasonably and candidly as we know how, what we believe about the emerging issues of the campaign,” the 1960 editorial read in part. “We have sought to arrive at our opinions as fairly as possible, with the guidance of our own principles of independence but free of commitment to any party or candidate.” Translation: We don’t relish candor as anything more than an expedient rhetorical posture, and must shy away from the clear moral implications of our own journalistic work.', 'That’s the gist of Lewis’s own slapdash argument, as well. Dismissing the notion that his quisling pose doubles as “as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another” Lewis asserts that it is, in fact, “consistent with the values the Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects.” If the Post indeed cherishes those values, it’s objectively impossible to square them with sitting out an election that could restore maximum power to a multiply convicted lawbreaker, bigot, sexual assaulter, abuser of executive power, and self-styled agent of political retribution whose own former cabinet members regard as a fascist. Readers of the Post’s editorial page would have been better served by an entirely blank space or a horoscope or word game, in place of Lewis’s self-congratulatory bilge.', 'Yet long-suffering Post readers couldn’t be all that surprised by Lewis’s moronic, self-canceling reasoning. This was also the paper that sat for three years on the damning news that Martha-Ann Alito, the wife of the Supreme Court justice who stans for Trump’s maximal executive power and gleefully struck down women’s rights to their own bodily autonomy, flew an upside-down flag outside of the couple’s home in a gesture of solidarity with the failed coup of January 6. And according to NPR’s Folfenflik, Lewis dangled the prospect of an exclusive interview with him in exchange for the writer’s pledge to bury developments in the phone-hacking case in his reporting.', 'This is a universe or so removed from the high-minded standards of character and public probity that Lewis professes to uphold in embracing a morally indefensible posture of nonalignment in a moment of democratic crisis. But it’s what you get when you staff the top of a masthead exclusively with people who know how to get along with rich men.', 'In the coming election, the fate of our democracy and fundamental civil rights are on the ballot. The conservative architects of Project 2025 are scheming to institutionalize Donald Trump’s authoritarian vision across all levels of government if he should win.', 'We’ve already seen events that fill us with both dread and cautious optimism—throughout it all, The Nation has been a bulwark against misinformation and an advocate for bold, principled perspectives. Our dedicated writers have sat down with Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders for interviews, unpacked the shallow right-wing populist appeals of J.D. Vance, and debated the pathway for a Democratic victory in November.', 'Stories like these and the one you just read are vital at this critical juncture in our country’s history.

Ex-WaPo Editor: This Is a Straight Bezos-Trump ‘Quid Pro Quo’,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ex-wapo-editor-straight-bezos-195405052.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'The Washington Post’s outgoing editor-at-large and longtime columnist has made explosive claims that its owner Jeff Bezos struck a deal with Donald Trump in order to kill the newspaper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris.', 'Robert Kagan, who resigned from his position on Friday after more than two decades at the publication, told the Daily Beast that Trump’s meeting with executives of Bezos’ Blue Origin space company the same day that the Amazon founder killed a plan to support Harris was proof of the backroom deal.', '“Trump waited to make sure that Bezos did what he said he was going to do, and then met with the Blue Origin people,” he said on Saturday. “Which tells us that there was an actual deal made, meaning that Bezos communicated, or through his people, communicated directly with Trump, and they set up this quid pro quo.”', 'The alleged collusion between Bezos and Trump, Kagan says, “is just the beginning,” adding that if the former president wins a second term, there will be “a lot of self censorship [in the media] and a lot of changing course just to be sure that they’re not going to be punished.”', 'Kagan became a vocal anti-Trump voice in 2016, writing about the dangers of authoritarianism in the event of a second Trump presidency, and about how the former president could jeopardize American democracy.', 'In 2023, Kagan warned about Trump’s potential influence on the media, saying, “Media owners will discover that a hostile and unbridled president can make their lives unpleasant in all sorts of ways.”', 'Bezos knows first hand the consequences of criticizing the former president. The Post’s 2016 endorsement of Hillary Clinton is widely thought to have led to him losing out on a $10 billion cloud computing defense contract awarded by the Trump administration. And, throughout the former president’s first term, he repeatedly attacked Bezos and Amazon, accusing them of scamming the United States Postal Service.', '“This is what we have to look forward to,” Kagan said. “All Trump has to do is threaten the corporate chiefs who run these organizations with real financial loss, and they will bend the knee.”', 'While the billionaire tech mogul did not buckle to Trump’s threats in years past, Kagan said that Bezos’ shock decision to pull the Harris endorsement had “obviously been in the works for some time,” describing his formerly hands-off approach to owning the Post as “a lot of Kabuki.”', '“We now know what Bezos’ intention was, therefore we now know why he hired Will Lewis,” he continued. “We were the ones who were naive in thinking that there was anything else going on here.”', 'Lewis, who is the newspaper’s publisher, claimed that the Post’s last-minute nixing of its endorsement had nothing to do with its owner, and was instead because, “I do not believe in presidential endorsements.” His claim contradicts reports from sources that Lewis “fought tooth and nail” to keep the endorsement.', 'According to Kagan, “all the facts” lead in the direction of Bezos attempting to transform the Post into something akin to The Wall Street Journal, a center right “anti-anti-Trump editorial slant,” with Lewis by his side.', '“Some journalists will stick around for that. Some will leave. If they leave, they can be replaced,” he said.']"

Lewis cast the decision as the newspaper returning to its “roots”; before the nineteen-seventies, the paper rarely endorsed Presidential candidates. Members of the opinion section had already drafted an endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris. The decision to not run it, and to end the tradition of issuing endorsements in Presidential elections, was, according to multiple news reports, ultimately made by Jeff Bezos, the Post’s owner, though a spokesperson for the newspaper characterized it as a “Washington Post decision.” Several days before Lewis’s announcement, the editorials editor of the Los Angeles Times had resigned after, she said, the newspaper’s owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, blocked the Times’ editorial board from endorsing Harris. The decisions by the Times and the Post have raised fears that media publishers, preparing for the possibility of a second Trump Administration, are being cowed by him. Two other L.A.
