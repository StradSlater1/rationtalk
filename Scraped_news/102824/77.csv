Mielke, PhD, with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.', 'The group recommends two implementation pathways for AD blood biomarkers — one for current use for triaging and another for future use to confirm amyloid pathology once blood biomarker tests have reached sufficient performance for this purpose.', 'In the triage pathway, a negative blood biomarker test would flag individuals unlikely to have detectable brain amyloid pathology. This outcome would prompt clinicians to focus on evaluating non–AD-related causes of cognitive impairment, which may streamline the diagnosis of other causes of cognitive impairment, the authors said.', 'A positive triage blood test would suggest a higher likelihood of amyloid pathology and prompt referral to secondary care for further assessment and consideration for a second, more accurate test, such as amyloid PET or CSF for amyloid confirmation.', 'In the confirmatory pathway, a positive blood biomarker test result would identify amyloid pathology without the need for a second test, providing a faster route to diagnosis, the authors noted.', 'Mielke emphasized that these recommendations represent a “first step” and will need to be updated as experiences with the AD blood biomarkers in clinical care increase and additional barriers and facilitators are identified.', '“These updates will likely include community-informed approaches that incorporate feedback from patients as well as healthcare providers, alongside results from validation in diverse real-world settings,” workgroup co-chair Chi Udeh-Momoh, PhD, MSc, with Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Brain and Mind Institute, Aga Khan University, Nairobi, Kenya, told Medscape Medical News.', 'The Alzheimer’s Association published “appropriate use” recommendations for blood biomarkers in 2022.', '“Currently, the Alzheimer’s Association is building an updated library of clinical guidance that distills the scientific evidence using de novo systematic reviews and translates them into clear and actionable recommendations for clinical practice,” Rebecca M. Edelmayer, PhD, vice president of scientific engagement, Alzheimer’s Association, told Medscape Medical News.', '“The first major effort with our new process will be the upcoming Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guideline on the Use of Blood-based Biomarkers (BBMs) in Specialty Care Settings. This guideline’s recommendations will be published in early 2025,” Edelmayer said.', 'Research has shown that amyloid beta and tau protein blood biomarkers — especially a high plasma phosphorylated (p)–tau217 levels — are highly accurate in identifying AD in patients with cognitive symptoms attending primary and secondary care clinics.', 'Several tests targeting plasma p-tau217 are now available for use. They include the PrecivityAD2 blood test from C2N Diagnostics and the Simoa p-Tau 217 Planar Kit and LucentAD p-Tau 217 — both from Quanterix.', 'In a recent head-to-head comparison of seven leading blood tests for AD pathology, measures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with AD outcomes.', 'A recent Swedish study showed that the PrecivityAD2 test had an accuracy of 91% for correctly classifying clinical, biomarker-verified AD.', '“We’ve been using these blood biomarkers in research for a long time and we’re now taking the jump to start using them in clinic to risk stratify patients,” said Fanny Elahi, MD, PhD, director of fluid biomarker research for the Barbara and Maurice Deane Center for Wellness and Cognitive Health at Icahn Mount Sinai in New York City.', 'New York’s Mount Sinai Health System is among the first in the northeast to offer blood tests across primary and specialty care settings for early diagnosis of AD and related dementias.', 'Edelmayer cautioned, “There is no single, stand-alone test to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease today. Blood testing is one piece of the diagnostic process.”', '“Currently, physicians use well-established diagnostic tools combined with medical history and other information, including neurological exams, cognitive and functional assessments as well as brain imaging and spinal fluid analysis and blood to make an accurate diagnosis and to understand which patients are eligible for approved treatments,” she told Medscape Medical News.', 'There are also emerging biomarkers in the research pipeline, Edelmayer said.', '“For example, some researchers think retinal imaging has the potential to detect biological signs of AD within certain areas of the eye,” she explained.', '“Other emerging biomarkers include examining components in saliva and the skin for signals that may indicate early biological changes in the brain. These biomarkers are still very exploratory, and more research is needed before these tests or biomarkers can be used more routinely to study risk or aid in diagnosis,” Edelmayer told Medscape Medical News.', 'Experts agree that blood tests represent a convenient and scalable option to address the anticipated surge in demand for biomarker testing with the availability of disease-modifying treatments. For now, however, they are not for all older adults worried about their memory.', '“Current practice should focus on using these blood biomarkers in individuals with cognitive impairment rather than in those with normal cognition or subjective cognitive decline until further research demonstrates effective interventions for individuals considered cognitively normal with elevated levels of amyloid,” the authors of a recent JAMA editorial noted.', 'At Mount Sinai, “we’re not starting with stone-cold asymptomatic individuals. But ultimately, this is what the blood tests are intended for — screening,” Elahi noted.', 'She also noted that Mount Sinai has a “very diverse population” — some with young onset cognitive symptoms, so the entry criteria for testing are “very wide.”', '“Anyone above age 40 with symptoms can qualify to get a blood test. We do ask at this stage that either the individual report symptoms or someone in their life or their clinician be worried about their cognition or their brain function,” Elahi said.', 'Elahi emphasized the importance of counseling patients who come to the clinic seeking an AD blood test. This should include how the diagnostic process will unfold and what the next steps are with a given result.', 'Elahi said patients need to be informed that AD blood biomarkers are still “relatively new,” and a test can help a patient “know the likelihood of having the disease, but it won’t be 100% definitive.”', 'To ensure the ethical principle of “do no harm,” counseling should ensure that patients are fully prepared for the implications of the test results and ensure that the decision to test aligns with the patient’s readiness and well-being, Elahi said.', 'Edelmayer said the forthcoming clinical practice guidelines will provide “evidence-based recommendations for physicians to help guide them through the decision-making process around who should be tested and when. In the meantime, the Alzheimer’s Association urges providers to refer to the 2022 appropriate use recommendations for blood tests in clinical practice and trial settings.”', 'Mielke has served on scientific advisory boards and/or having consulted for Acadia, Biogen, Eisai, LabCorp, Lilly, Merck, PeerView Institute, Roche, Siemens Healthineers, and Sunbird Bio.

Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s present complex challenges to health care system,https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/27/blood-based-biomarkers-alzheimers-tests-health-care/,"['', '', '', 'By Naveen Reddy and Kristine Yaffe', 'Oct. 27, 2024', 'Reddy is a health policy fellow and neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Yaffe is the vice chair of psychiatry, neurology, and epidemiology at UCSF and the director of the Center for Population Brain Health at UCSF.', 'During an annual checkup, the patient says: “Doc, I saw a commercial about a blood test that can tell if I’ll develop Alzheimer’s. I watched my mother go through it. I want to get tested.”', 'He’s referring to the new Alzheimer’s blood-based biomarkers. Despite not showing any symptoms of Alzheimer’s — he manages his own finances, drives, shops, and cooks elaborate meals for his wife — he’s clearly worried.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'The doctor replies, “OK, there might be some out-of-pocket costs, but I can order the test.” He looks relieved. “But just so you know,” she tells him, “we’re still not sure what to do with a positive result.”', 'A new age of dementia care has been ushered in by the development of anti-amyloid antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. These therapies are the first FDA-approved treatments for AD released in nearly 20 years. As a consequence of these disease-modifying treatments, the accurate and efficient detection of Alzheimer’s has become paramount, especially as earlier detection allows for more effective treatment. With the advent of blood-based biomarkers, the ability to possibly detect Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms emerge has introduced new clinical and ethical challenges to the diagnosis and management of the disease.  ', 'At the moment, the typical process of diagnosing Alzheimer’s can be difficult and often requires neuropsychological batteries, MRIs, PET scans, and CSF testing — all of which are costly and only available at certain specialized clinics.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Enter the blood-based biomarkers, which can detect the amyloid plaques and tau tangles that define Alzheimer’s through a simple blood test. These ground-breaking assays come with high diagnostic accuracy — around 85-90% — and when combined with traditional testing, can effectively diagnose Alzheimer’s in patients with cognitive decline. It cannot be overstated how paradigm-shifting these two developments are for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s. Since the approval of lecanemab in July 2023, we have acquired the ability to effectively detect and treat the underlying pathological process of Alzheimer’s disease, even though its full efficacy remains uncertain.', 'Back to our patient. Let’s say his blood test returns positive for amyloid plaques and tau tangles. What next? He doesn’t have any symptoms of Alzheimer’s and is completely functional for his age. You decide to refer him to a neurologist for further evaluation. They obtain an MRI, which shows a healthy brain. Neuropsychological testing is normal. At this point, we’re stuck — should we formally diagnose him with Alzheimer’s despite showing no symptoms of the disease? And if so, do we then initiate therapy with an anti-amyloid agent? Billions of dollars and the lives of millions of individuals hinge upon the answers to these questions.', 'The above scenario is illustrative of the complex challenges that blood-based biomarkers present to the health care system. On the positive side, early detection allows individuals to incorporate lifestyle changes to reduce the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s. Increasing physical activity, improving diet, and aggressively managing chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes have been associated with less amyloid burden in the brain. For those with a family history of Alzheimer’s, blood-based biomarker testing can provide critical insights, enabling proactive steps to be taken even before symptoms arise. Lastly, while not yet approved for asymptomatic patients, the anti-amyloid drugs may offer the possibility of slowing disease progression if administered early.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'However, the promise is as yet far from being realized. The clinical utility of these tests in asymptomatic individuals is still under intense debate, particularly because the presence of amyloid doesn’t guarantee the development of Alzheimer’s. Meanwhile, a positive result can lead to significant distress if there isn’t a clear path forward.', 'The financial implications of widespread blood-based biomarker use are substantial. These tests, and subsequent treatments, are expensive and may not be fully covered by insurance, placing a heavy financial burden on patients. This raises ethical questions about equity and access — who should be tested, and who will bear the cost? Universal testing could lead to earlier interventions and better outcomes for some, but it also increases the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In turn, the widespread adoption of these tests could strain health care resources, potentially diverting attention from other critical areas.', 'It is crucial, then, that we develop strict standards regarding who should be tested and when. A research infrastructure needs to be established whose purpose is to determine whether asymptomatic individuals with positive blood tests eventually develop clinical Alzheimer’s and whether anti-amyloid therapies given to asymptomatic individuals prevent cognitive decline. The results from these studies should then be evaluated by an impartial organization, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce, to establish guidelines on the use of blood-based biomarkers for screening in asymptomatic individuals. Meanwhile, primary care providers, geriatricians, and neurologists need to be ready to educate their patients on their potential benefits and limitations.', 'As we enter this new era of Alzheimer’s diagnostics and therapeutics, we must be careful to balance the power of these tools with their risks and downstream costs. The real-world implementation of blood-based biomarkers will require close collaboration between manufacturers, professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, and governmental entities to ensure they are provided economically and equitably. Only through a careful and methodical approach to their integration into the health care ecosystem will the full potential of these technologies be realized.', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Naveen Reddy is a health policy fellow and neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco.

Many of the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, like memory loss, overlap with symptoms associated with normal ageing and other neurodegenerative disorders, creating a need for precision during the diagnosis process.2', 'In the future, we hope to be able to recognise and diagnose Alzheimer’s disease much earlier. At Johnson & Johnson, our differentiated Alzheimer’s disease research program is focused on leveraging the latest advancements in precision medicine, data science and digital health to help make earlier diagnosis an option and help treat the right patient with the right treatment at the right time.', 'More specifically, our research teams are focused on the tau protein and studying digital, blood and imaging biomarkers to aid development programs and decision making within them. We’re investigating powerful tools that may allow for an earlier – and biologically based – prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, which are being evaluated to help identify patients for clinical trials. We hope to leverage these advancements and technologies to monitor disease progression and measure the therapeutic effect in our development programs.', 'Obesity is a serious, chronic disease.', ' Learn how to tackle it with innovative combo therapies!', 'Join EurofinsDiscovery’s Luke Oostdyk, PhD, as he discusses cell-based assays for testing anti-obesity drugs against multiple targets.

As a company that has been in this space for decades, we’ve been able to learn from our successes, our past experiences and evolving scientific advancements over time to shape the strategy we have in place today: to alter the course of the disease well before daily function is affected. Biomarkers are an essential advancement that will help determine risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, diagnose the disease before symptoms have progressed significantly, predict how quickly patients may experience cognitive decline and evaluate how well new therapies are working.1,3', 'The A/T/N framework is accepted in research to categorise patients based on the presence of the three core biomarkers of the disease–amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration.4 Imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and increasingly, blood-based tests can quantify these pathologies, helping researchers understand which patients may have or be at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.3', 'Use of the A/T/N framework has confirmed much of what we previously understood from carefully conducted longitudinal observational and post-mortem studies and helps translate that understanding into prospective clinical trials.5 We hope to advance the A/T/N framework from clinical trials to real-world settings for diagnosis and to guide patients along their treatment journey as more therapeutic options become available and, again, to ensure the right patient is treated with the right treatment at the right time.', 'With Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, we know changes occur in a patient’s blood beyond the A, T and N.6 We also know that there are many different pathologies in the brain that can cause dementia beyond A, T and N, that may also be found in people with Alzheimer’s disease.7', 'Our hope is that large biofluids proteomics datasets can help us find biomarkers beyond A, T and N that facilitate precision intervention.8 These may also help in identifying or validating novel targets for therapy beyond A and T.8', '“Integration” is the key word here, as we need both approaches to enhance identification of biomarkers and drug targets for Alzheimer’s disease. Hypothesis-driven work led us to identify beta amyloid and phosphorylated tau as both targets and biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease.9', 'Hypothesis-free approaches, like the proteomics datasets mentioned above, may reveal biomarkers that had not been previously considered.', 'Today, with the help of these very large datasets and advanced analytics like machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), we’re able to continue our investigations into unknown contributors to disease at a less expensive cost. As a researcher, it’s exciting to see how these innovations are bringing hope to patients, caregivers and loved ones impacted by Alzheimer’s disease.   ', 'Although extensive progress has been made over the past few years, there is  still so much we do not  know. Continuing to expand our knowledge of biomarkers and identifying those that can complement A/T/N is critical for us to be able to better understand Alzheimer’s disease.', 'For example, patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease may also have other neurodegenerative pathologies. At post-mortem, pathologies involving alpha-synuclein and TDP43 are commonly observed in these patients but are not historically considered among the “cardinal” pathologies that define the disease.10,11 We need biomarkers of alpha-synuclein and TDP43 to complement the biomarkers we have today for A/T/N. As we improve our understanding of alpha-synuclein and TDP43, and how they contribute to disease progression, we will be able to better identify and target the right patients.12,13', 'Vascular disease is another pathology often accompanying Alzheimer’s disease, where it has been associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks.14', 'A well-known, and frequently studied component of Alzheimer’s pathology is inflammation.15 Over the past decade, in fact, the presence of inflammation has been associated with worsening of both tau and amyloid pathology, potentially representing a key step in the development of disease.15', 'One day, not before long, we hope to have A, T, N, a-synuclein, TDP43, vascular disease biomarkers, along with many others. A full complement of biomarkers accompanied by a full complement of therapies targeting different pathologies will be the promise of precision.', 'At Johnson & Johnson, our goal is to achieve this for diseases of the brain, moving beyond a “one-size-fits-all” diagnosis and treatment approach.

Biomarkers provide critical insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy, especially in conditions like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where early detection and precise monitoring are key.', 'Simoa® technology, an ultra-sensitive immunoassay platform, is at the forefront of this revolution. With advanced sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities, Simoa is changing how biomarkers are identified and validated, driving a transformation in both the drug approval process and patient management. According to David Wilson, Vice President of Clinical Strategy at Quanterix, Simoa’s cutting-edge technology is playing a pivotal role in unlocking new possibilities for researchers and clinicians.', 'At the core of Simoa’s impact is its digital immunoassay technology, which is up to 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional immunoassays. This enhanced sensitivity allows for the detection of low-abundance biomarkers in fluid samples like plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serum, often at concentrations too low for traditional methods to capture.', 'Wilson highlights the breakthrough this technology provides, “Simoa’s ability to detect single molecules means we can measure biomarkers at levels that were previously impossible, opening doors to earlier and more accurate diagnosis.” This level of detection is especially important in neurological biomarker research, where small changes in proteins such as neurofilament light (NF-L) are critical for diagnosing diseases like AD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and traumatic brain injury (TBI).', 'NF-L, a protein released following axonal damage, is a key marker in many neurodegenerative diseases. With the Simoa NF-light® assay, researchers can quantify NF-L levels in both human and animal samples, providing a powerful tool for tracking subtle changes that signal early neurodegenerative activity. This capability is central to early intervention, where timely diagnosis can greatly improve patient outcomes.', ""Simoa is at the heart of pioneering research efforts aimed at revolutionizing Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment. Leading scientists like Dr. Kaj Blennow and Dr. Henrik Zetterberg have used Simoa technology to validate blood-based biomarkers for AD, advancing research that could make early and non-invasive diagnosis a reality1."", 'The development of blood-based biomarkers such as pTau181 and pTau217 has had a profound impact on the field. These phosphorylated tau proteins are crucial indicators of amyloid pathology, a key feature of AD. The pTau-181 assay has been designated as a Breakthrough Device by the FDA for AD – this designation is granted to products that have the potential to offer a more effective diagnosis of life-threatening diseases.', 'By using these assays, researchers can monitor tau concentrations in blood samples, providing a non-invasive, cost-effective method for tracking disease progression.

The Simoa® HD-X Analyzer™ allows for simultaneous multiplexing of multiple biomarkers, which is especially useful in clinical trials where various disease markers must be monitored at once. This ability to test multiple biomarkers in a single assay offers a more comprehensive view of disease progression, helping researchers measure how well new therapies are working.', 'In the Eisai lecanemab Phase III trial, for example, Simoa assays were used to track key biomarkers in patients undergoing treatment for Alzheimer’s. By comparing biomarkers in patients receiving the drug versus those in the control group, researchers were able to gather crucial data on target engagement and treatment efficacy. Wilson notes, “These assays provide invaluable insight into how a drug interacts with disease biology, giving us the data we need to assess its effectiveness.”', 'Looking ahead, Simoa’s role in drug development and patient management is looking to grow even further. As researchers continue to refine blood-based biomarkers, their impact on patient care will become progressively more significant. For example, these biomarkers offer an unprecedented ability to monitor treatment efficacy in real time, which can help clinicians adjust treatments or dosages based on how a patient is responding.', 'For Alzheimer’s patients, the potential benefits are huge. Non-invasive, blood-based tests like the Simoa LucentAD p-Tau217 could make early detection more accessible and affordable, enabling more patients to start treatment sooner and slowing the progression of the disease. Wilson explains, “The goal is to bring these tests into routine clinical settings, so that even primary care physicians can perform early Alzheimer’s diagnostics.”', 'Moreover, as FDA approvals and clinical guidelines continue to support blood-based biomarkers, Simoa is likely to become an even more integral part of mainstream healthcare. Its ability to measure multiple biomarkers in one assay provides clinicians with a more detailed picture of a patient’s disease state, which will be invaluable as new therapies are introduced.', 'In a field that demands innovation and precision, Simoa® technology is leading the way, transforming how diseases like Alzheimer’s are diagnosed, treated, and monitored.
