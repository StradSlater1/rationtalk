""So, we ran it. I already knew I was going to be open before the play was even called. Just great playcalling by Coach and great execution by us.""', 'The Packers used the same offensive alignment on the first two plays of the final drive. On the first, Reed stayed in to block from the right slot, and Willis handed off to Jacobs (25 carries for 127 yards and two touchdowns) for a 6-yard gain.', 'Just before the snap on the second play, Willis made a pre-snap adjustment -- what the Packers call a ""can"" -- and it worked like a charm. This time, Reed delayed his release, perhaps to make the defense think he was staying in to block again, and then turned his crossing route up the field.', '""Not only was it a \'can\' play, but it was a play that we didn\'t have up in the game plan,"" LaFleur said. ""We talked about it on Tuesday. We thought that there might be something there, decided against it, and then we ran the keeper earlier in the gamer and [passing game coordinator Jason] Vrable suggested it. He\'s like, \'Hey, it looks like the play is there.\'', '""And so we put it in on the sideline. So, no reps in practice. I think that\'s a big-time credit to our guys, to be able to go out there and execute it. Jayden Reed, Tucker, the O-line, the backs, everybody\'s selling it. And then ultimately Malik making the throw. So, that was a pretty cool one. Probably one I\'ll never forget.""', 'Not only was it a play the Packers never ran in practice last week, but Willis never took a single snap with the starters in practice, either.', '""The starter, he needs all the reps,"" Willis said. ""You get your reps on scout [team], you get your reps in [individual drills], and you just do as you can to use those mental reps and do whatever you can to be ready if called upon.""', ""All three of Willis' extended appearances have come against teams from the AFC South. He won a start against the Titans, the team that traded him to Green Bay on Aug. 26 for a seventh-round pick, a start against the Colts and now a relief appearance against the Jaguars."", '""It\'s been pretty damn impressive,"" LaFleur said.

First, you need a bankroll, obviously. Second, you have to have unwavering confidence because there are time when you will be terrible with the picks and others where you will be on fire you can't wait to place the next bet. Third, and perhaps most importantly, you need a bit of humility. The fact is I put out somewhere around 730 picks per year (2 per day every day). I'm going to be wrong about certain things and really wrong about some of them. Two teams are playing in this one which highlight both ends of the spectrum. I was wrong about the Packers, but I was correct about the Jaguars. "", ""I wasn't high on the Packers coming into this season, and most of that was due to Jordan Love being under center. It wasn't that I thought the guy was a terrible quarterback or anything. It is more that I thought he was a bit overhyped. There were a lot of people saying he would be the MVP, and I just didn't see it. He's done a great job of getting the ball to receivers, and none of them on his team are household names. He has thrown 15 touchdowns this season, but does have eight interceptions, which isn't ideal. Josh Jacobs is one of the better running backs in the game, but he has only found the endzone on the ground once this year. It doesn't seem like the running game is a primary option for the Packers. Don't expect it to be the primary option in this one either as the Jaguars defense is a top-6 defense against the run. Where you can attack them is through the air. Jacksonville is the second worst team in football against the pass. The Vikings and Ravens surround the Jaguars at the bottom, but the difference is that teams have to throw against those two teams in order to try and come back in games. The Packers should get ahead and stay ahead.

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-Imagn Images', ""The Jaguars are having a miserable season, but they did capture their second win last week. They are also coming back from London where they played two consecutive games. They let Caleb Williams throw the ball everywhere on them in the loss to the Bears. The next week, against the Patriots, they went down early, but they were able to win with relative ease. Tank Bigsby had a great game for them, but lets be real here, the Patriots are not a good team. For the season, Trevor Lawrence has racked up yards, but he hasn't been able to convert those to touchdown passes with too many drives stalling out. Against the Packers, they will need to utilize a balanced approach. Green Bay isn't a top defense, but they are slightly above average in both the pass and rush defense. "", ""The problem is that I don't think the Jaguars are going to be able to keep up with the scoring of Green Bay. The Packers passing game should have a feast against this Jaguars team. I also think it is a bit odd that Jacksonville didn't take the week off after coming home from London. This seems like a terrible spot for Jacksonville. I'm taking the Packers in this game to cover the -4.5 it is listed at right now, but I'd play this up to -6.5 as I think they win by at least one touchdown.

Officially, Love was pulled from the game with a groin injury, which originally was aggravated during the first half in Jacksonville. Love attempted to play through the injury for several series, as he even lined up under center in the second half versus Jacksonville before backup quarterback Malik Willis stepped in his place.', 'Willis did enough to seal the game, completing four of five passes for 56 yards and a touchdown on top of four carries for 23 yards. Don’t kid yourself, though, Willis’ 100-plus passer rating comes via a sample sample size where the team has transitioned to a run-first offense. The Packers still want Love on the field, given the option.', 'According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Love will undergo tests on Monday that should give Green Bay a hint at how serious the quarterback’s injury is. Packers head coach Matt LaFleur said he was “concerned” about Love, but only in the context that Love wasn’t able to “protect himself,” a phrase LaFleur often uses when discussing injuries.', 'Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio added to Pelissero’s report, claiming that a league source said that Love will go through an MRI scan and that the “belief is that it’s not a long-term injury.” What you’re hearing is a collective exhale from the Packers’ faithful.', ""Hopefully, some rest for Love will allow him to suit up against the Detroit Lions, the NFC's number one seed and the leader in the Packers’ NFC North, on Sunday. Green Bay can't afford to slip up in tight NFC North and NFC Wild Card races. If the Packers win next week versus Detroit, they (or the NFC East’s Washington Commanders) will be the top NFC seed going into Week 10. If Green Bay loses, though, there’s a good chance they’ll be the seventh seed going into Week 10, the final playoff spot in the NFC. A big reason for that is the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles, two teams that have beaten the Packers this season, breathing down their neck in the NFC standings."", 'To say the least, a lot is at stake on Sunday.', '', '', 'Gambling Problem?

He replaced Jordan Love early in the third quarter due to a groin injury Love had been trying to fight through since the game's first possession."", ""After cashing in on a Jaguars turnover just 5 yards from paydirt for a 27-17 lead early in the fourth quarter, it looked like the Packers were in good shape. Only to have Jacksonville score 10 straight points (despite its top two receivers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Christian Kirk, leaving with injuries) and tie the game on QB Trevor Lawrence's 14-yard TD pass to tight end Evan Engram with 1:48 left."", 'From there, it was up to Willis, and on the second play of the ensuing drive, he ran a play-action bootleg and found receiver Jayden Reed wide open down the sideline for 51 yards. The Packers were suddenly in position to win.', '""I can\'t say enough great things about Malik Willis,"" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. ""The moment\'s never too big for him.""', 'The play was what the Packers call a ""can,"" or audible when the QB gets to the line of scrimmage and can switch to a secondary play call built into the first.', '""We were looking for a certain look,"" Willis said, explaining the previous play call was the same, but the Jaguars weren\'t in the coverage the Packers wanted. ""We ran it again, got the look we were looking for, and I canned right to it. It was perfect.""', 'From there, the Packers ran the clock down to two seconds, and new kicker Brandon McManus hit the game-winner from 24 yards out.', '""To be able to win on a walk-off two weeks in a row is kinda crazy,"" LaFleur said. ""I don\'t want it to continue to happen that way. I\'d like to win outright, because it\'s taken years off our lives. But just really happy for our guys.""', 'LaFleur said he had ""no idea"" on the prognosis for Love\'s groin injury, which initially occurred on the Packers\' first possession. He was walking around gingerly from there on, though he was still able to direct three scoring drives in the first half worth 13 points.', ""He threw one interception, which teammates Xavier McKinney erased on the Jaguars' next drive with his sixth pick of the year. Love wound up 14-of-22 for 196 yards, including a 67-yard catch-and-run by tight end Tucker Kraft."", '""Everybody could see him struggling to move around,"" LaFleur said of Love. ""It got to a point where we, and he, didn\'t feel like he could protect himself.""', ""After the Packers' third play of the second half, Love hobbled over to the sideline and then just went down to be attended to. Willis took over from there and went 4-of-5 for 56 yards."", ""The game started with the Jaguars not getting a first down over their first four possessions – including McKinney's INT. Then Jacksonville put together a rash of explosive plays to score 10 points in the final six minutes of the first half."", 'Then, after allowing a long third-quarter TD drive, the defense made its biggest play of the game. Rookie linebacker Edgerrin Cooper punched the ball out from behind Lawrence on a sack, and teammate Devonte Wyatt recovered on the doorstep.', ""Kraft's short TD catch put the Packers in control, up by 10."", '""You could argue that was the difference in the game,"" LaFleur said. ""Twice the defense set us up with great field position.', '""We knew they were going to get their shots in. It was just about staying resilient.""', 'Jacobs pounded his way to 127 yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries, including a highlight-reel 38-yard scoring run on which he dodged multiple tacklers before breaking away into the open field.', '""It looked nifty to me, too,"" Willis said when asked about Jacobs\' footwork on the play. ""It was awesome. Love seeing him go out there to do his thing.""', 'Added LaFleur: ""He\'s a stud, isn\'t he? The physicality he runs with. He\'s a pro\'s pro. He demands it of himself but demands it of others as well.""', ""On the final drive, though, right after Reed's 51-yard gain, Jacobs ran for 3 yards to the Jacksonville 12 and came up limping just a bit. That led to Chris Brooks going in, and he promptly ran 8 yards up the middle."", 'The Jaguars were going to let Brooks score, but the Packers were in what they call a ""Rolex"" situation, where the priority above all else is to keep the clock running.', 'So Brooks smartly slid to the ground with a first down inside the 5, forcing the Jaguars to use their last timeout with 54 seconds left. The Packers were then able to burn the rest of the time.', '""He\'s a selfless guy,"" LaFleur said of Brooks, who was just signed a few weeks ago and has quickly worked himself into a regular role in the backfield. He gave up his chance to score his first NFL TD by sliding.', '""He does what we ask him to do. He did a good job of executing and not scoring. He\'ll get his time. Chris Brooks has been a huge asset to our team.""', ""Love's status is very much up in the air with 6-1 Detroit coming to Lambeau Field next Sunday. Same for Jacobs, though LaFleur said he wanted to go back in the game at the end and they played it safe."", ""Also, cornerback Jaire Alexander appeared to not be walking carefully as he left the field following Engram's game-tying TD catch late in the game, and rookie safety Evan Williams left in the first half with a hamstring injury and did not return."", '""Obviously really proud of our guys,"" LaFleur said.

Plus, he contributed another 73 yards and an additional score as a runner.', 'Most notably, though, on the second play of the Packers’ final drive of the game, Willis connected with receiver Jayden Reed on a 51-yard bomb. It ultimately helped set up Brandon McManus for a 24-yard, game-winning field goal, his second walk-off kick for Green Bay in as many weeks.', '“Can’t say enough great things about Malik Willis, the job that he’s able to do to go in there,” LaFleur said. “The moment’s never too big for him, and he made a lot of big-time plays in this game. Not only with his arm, but his ability to, had a big pick-up with his legs. I’m just really proud of our guys.” ', 'Willis, formerly of the Tennessee Titans, started Weeks 2 and 3 this season for the Packers, and led Green Bay to wins in both contests. He completed 25-of-33 passes for 324 yards and two touchdowns in those two games. ', 'Leading up to each of the aforementioned early-season contests, Willis was afforded the opportunity to work with the first-team offense. It’s something he did not have the chance of doing this week, making his performance Sunday all the more impressive. ', '“It’s always hard when you turn to your backup quarterback, because all their reps are in practice running the scout team. So, he didn’t get any reps with the (game) plan,” LaFleur said. “(Packers offensive assistant) Sean Mannion, (assistant quarterbacks coach) Connor Lewis do a great job with staying with him post-practice to work on getting reps on air. But, there’s nothing like going out there and doing the real thing. And, I thought he played as well as we could have ever expected him to. I thought he did a really nice job.”', 'If Willis were to start next Sunday, it’d mark his first career start against the Lions. Meanwhile, Love has four career games (two starts) under his belt against Detroit, and has thrown for 648 yards, five touchdowns and four interceptions in those contests. ', 'The talented quarterback will undergo further testing, but it is reportedly believed Love avoided a long-term injury.', 'The Packers (6-2), winners of four in a row, sit a half game behind the Lions (6-1) for first place in the NFC North.', ""Vito has covered the NFL and the Detroit Lions for the past five years.
