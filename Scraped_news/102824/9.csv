Fact check: 32 false claims Trump made to Joe Rogan,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/27/politics/fact-check-trump-rogan-podcast/index.html,"['', 'Donald Trump sat down Friday with prominent podcast host Joe Rogan for a conversational interview that ran for nearly three hours — and the former president delivered his standard bombardment of false claims, at least 32 in all.', 'Many of those false claims are lies that were debunked months or even years ago. The claims spanned a variety of topics, including immigration policy, environmental and energy policy, the legitimacy of the 2020 election, Trump’s record in office, Vice President Kamala Harris, crowd sizes, and how schools deal with transgender children.', 'Here is a fact check of 32 false claims Trump made to Rogan. This is not intended as a complete list of the inaccurate statements Trump uttered in the interview; with just over a week to go until Election Day, we were unable to look into every dubious assertion he made.', 'Migrants and murderers: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that “we had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years.” In reality, as the Department of Homeland Security and independent experts have noted, that official figure is about immigrants with homicide convictions in the US today who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s own administration, not over the past three years or under the Biden administration. You can read more here.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump returns to ‘epicenter of everything’ for Madison Square Garden rally', 'Trump’s border wall: The former president falsely claimed, “You know, I built 570 miles of wall.” That’s a significant exaggeration; official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump — including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.', 'Harris’ border role: Trump repeated a regular false claim about Harris: “She was in charge of the border.” She was not and is not; Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the Biden administration official in charge of border security. In reality, President Joe Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.', 'The number of migrants: Trump claimed that at least “21 million” people have illegally crossed the border during the Biden administration. Through September, the country had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”', 'The outcome of the 2020 election: Trump repeated his lie that he won the 2020 election, falsely claiming, “I won that second election so easy.” He lost, fair and square, to Biden, who beat Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and earned over 7 million more votes than Trump.', 'The legitimacy of the 2020 election: Trump made various specific false assertions about the 2020 election, claiming it was “crooked”; that his opponents cheated using the guise of the Covid-19 pandemic; and, vaguely, that it was marred by “old-fashioned ballot-screwing.” All of this is baseless.', 'Polling in 2016: Trump told a story about how, he said, a Washington Post/ABC News poll of Wisconsin during his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton showed him “down 17 points the day before the election,” but he knew it was wrong because of the size of his crowds, and he ended up winning the state: “I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won; it’s crooked stuff.” This story is false; the poll showing him down 17 the week of the election came during his 2020 race against Biden, and he lost Wisconsin that year — though by less than one percentage point.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nVance insists Trump’s ‘enemy from within’ comments weren’t directed at political rivals', 'The 2020 election and Wisconsin: Trump falsely claimed, “If you take a look at Wisconsin, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed and stolen.” This did not happen, “virtually” or otherwise; while some Wisconsin Republicans certainly support Trump’s claim that the election was rigged and stolen, the state’s elections authorities have not made such assertions — and as PolitiFact previously reported, even Republican-led election reviews did not find that Trump won the state.', 'An election ruling in Virginia: Trump falsely claimed that, just before he walked in for the Friday interview, there was a ruling in a legal “case where they found thousands of illegal ballots.” This case did not involve “illegal ballots”; rather, a judge ruled that Virginia had purged voter registrations from its rolls too close to Election Day. You can read more here.', 'Grocery stores and identification: Calling for strict voter identification laws, Trump spoke of how identification is required in other circumstances, saying, “When you go to a grocery store, you give ID.” This was a little vaguer than his previous declarations that “you need” ID to buy groceries, but it’s nonsense nonetheless; few grocery shoppers are required to provide identification unless they are paying by check or buying alcohol, tobacco or certain medications.', 'A Carter commission and mail-in ballots: Trump repeated his false claim that a commission led by former President Jimmy Carter published a report whose “primary finding was you cannot have mail-in ballots.” Trump added, “The one thing with Jimmy Carter: He had a very strong commission. It was, no mail-in ballots.”', 'Though the commission Carter co-chaired was generally skeptical of mail-in ballots, calling absentee voting “the largest source of potential voter fraud,” it did not say, “You cannot have mail-in ballots,” as Trump claimed. In fact, its report highlighted an example of successful mail-only elections — noting that Oregon, a state that has been conducting elections by mail-in voting since the late 1990s, “appears to have avoided significant fraud in its vote-by-mail elections by introducing safeguards to protect ballot integrity, including signature verification.”', 'The report also offered some recommendations for making the use of mail-in ballots more secure and called for “further research on the pros and cons” of voting by mail (as well as early voting).', 'Trump’s Las Vegas crowd size: In his latest exaggeration about crowd sizes, Trump claimed there were “29,000 people” at his event the night prior. His rally Thursday night, in Las Vegas, was at an arena with a capacity under 19,000.', 'Trump’s McDonald’s crowd size: Trump falsely claimed that there were “28,000 people sitting around” the McDonald’s in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he held a publicity event last weekend in which he briefly performed some of the duties of an employee (the restaurant was closed to the public). This is fiction; while videos show there was a substantial pro-Trump crowd gathered in the vicinity of the restaurant, it is obvious that it didn’t approach 28,000. A local journalist on the scene, Tom Sofield, the publisher of Bucks County news outlets, wrote on social media Tuesday: “There were several thousand excited supporters nearby, but the figure wasn’t 25,000, as stated by the former president later.”', 'Harris’ schedule: Trump, criticizing Harris’ work ethic, falsely claimed she “took off yesterday” and “took off the day before,” and also that “she’s going to take off tomorrow or the next day.” Trump is entitled to argue that Harris isn’t campaigning hard, but she was not “off” or scheduled to be off any of these days. On Wednesday, she participated in a CNN town hall in Pennsylvania; on Thursday, she held a rally in Georgia; on Friday, she held a rally in Texas; on Saturday, she held a rally in Michigan; on Sunday, she is scheduled to make a series of campaign stops in Philadelphia.', 'Trump and ISIS: Repeating one of his regular false claims, Trump said, “We defeated ISIS in record time. It was supposed to take years, and we did it in a matter of weeks.” The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.', 'Obama and Kim Jong Un: Trump, touting his relationship with Kim Jong Un, revived his old false claim that the North Korean leader refused to meet with Barack Obama when the then-president sought a meeting: “They wouldn’t meet Obama. He (Obama) tried to meet. They wouldn’t even talk to him about it.”', 'There is no evidence that Obama ever sought a meeting with Kim. Independent experts on North Korea and former Obama officials told CNN in 2019 that the claim is fictional.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump floats ending the federal income tax. Here’s what that would mean', 'Who pays tariffs: \ufeffTrump repeated his frequent false claim that, through tariffs, “I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China.” US importers make the tariff payments, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs on China.', 'Previous presidents and tariffs on China: \ufeffTrump repeated his frequent false claim that no previous president had imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, saying, “Nobody took in 10 cents, not one other president.” The US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump’s predecessor, Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.', 'China and Taiwan: Trump repeated an exaggeration about China: “The day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of Taiwan — 28 bombers.”', 'Trump was wrong about key details of this incident. On the third and fourth days of the Biden presidency, not the day Trump left office, China sent military planes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone over the Taiwan Strait — not “over the middle of Taiwan,” a major difference. Also, the incident involved 28 Chinese planes but not “28 bombers.” The New York Times reported at the time that the Taiwanese military said eight Chinese bombers were involved; the other planes were fighters, anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane.', 'And it’s worth noting that China also sent planes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone during Trump’s presidency. In early 2021, Taiwan News reported that, according to a recent report funded by Taiwan’s government, “In 2020, the Chinese military violated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) more times than in any year since 1996.”', 'Global warming and sea level rise: Trump repeated a regular false claim minimizing the threat of climate change: “I watch these poor fools talking about, ‘Our oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 500 years.’” The global average sea level is rising more per year than Trump claimed that unnamed concerned people say it will rise over 500 years; NASA reported in March that the global average sea-level rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches per year, more than double the rate in 1993.', 'Electric vehicle charging stations: Trump falsely claimed that the Biden administration spent $9 billion on just eight electric vehicle charging stations: “They built the charger stations, right, in the Midwest. They built eight of them. They cost $9 billion.”', 'As FactCheck.org and others have noted, Trump was distorting news articles about the slow pace at which $7.5 billion in federal funds allocated for electric charging have been spent. The articles reported that, as of March, only eight charging stations had been built under the program (not all in the Midwest). The articles did not say that these stations had themselves cost the entire $7.5 billion, let alone $9 billion.', 'The number of charging stations built with this federal funding has increased since March. The  Federal Highway Administration told USA Today that, as of October 11, 20 stations had been built with the money, with plans underway for more than 800 additional stations.', 'California and electricity: Trump, reviving his false claim about the stability of the electric system in California, said, “They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend.” California does not have “brownouts every weekend.” A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN in late August that the state had not had any outages because of electricity demand since 2020, and a spokesperson for the entity that manages the power grid for about 80% of the state said the same.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump says he’s open to eliminating income taxes and repeats ‘enemy from within’ rhetoric on podcast with Joe Rogan', 'A LNG plant in Louisiana: Trump revived a false claim he repeatedly made during his presidency, claiming that he “instantly” secured a key environmental permit to allow for the construction of a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana after the initiative had been on hold “for 14 years.” In fact, this facility was granted its key permits under the Obama administration, and its construction also began under Obama.', 'Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve: Trump repeated his false claim that before the Biden administration suspended oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 2021, “They were getting ready to start drilling. … It was all set to go.”', '“To quote our friends at PolitiFact, what Trump said in this case qualifies as ‘pants on fire,’” Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said last year after Trump made the same claim. Molchanov said, “No one was ready to start drilling there, in 2017 or at any other point in time.”', 'There is no drilling infrastructure in place in the refuge; major oil companies have shown little interest in the site; and the seven leases the Biden administration eventually canceled were all held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state entity that is not an oil company.', 'Trump’s response to “lock her up” chants: Trump repeated his false claim that he “never said” the words “lock her up” when his supporters chanted that refrain about his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. He added, “I’d always go, ‘Take it easy. Just relax.’” In fact, Trump repeatedly said the words “lock her up” in both 2016 and 2020, and he also repeatedly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using other language.', 'Trump and Oprah: Trump repeated a false claim he has been making for at least 11 years, saying he appeared on Oprah Winfrey’s popular television program during “one of her last shows” in “that final week.” In fact, Trump appeared about three and a half months before Winfrey’s show concluded, not during its star-studded final week.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nWhy these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP', 'Trump’s tax cuts: Repeating another regular false claim, the former president claimed that he signed the “biggest tax cuts in history.” Independent analyses have found that his tax-cut law was not the biggest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.', 'Supreme Court appointments: Trump touted the fact that he appointed three Supreme Court justices, then said, “Most people get none,” adding that “even if a president is in there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance.” This is false; no president who served for eight years did not get a chance to appoint a single Supreme Court justice. Only four presidents didn’t get a chance to appoint one justice to the Supreme Court, as PolitiFact previously reported, and three of them served for less than a full four-year term, while the other, Carter, served for four years.', 'Trump’s uncle and MIT: Trump repeated a false claim that his uncle John Trump, whom he has repeatedly invoked as evidence of the smarts of his family, was the “longest-serving” professor in the history of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. John Trump was one of the longest-serving professors at MIT, but not the very longest; the school told Newsweek early this year that at least 10 other people were on the faculty for longer.', 'Schools and transgender children: Trump repeated his false claim that schools are sending children for gender-affirming surgeries without parental consent: “Who would want to have — there’s so many — the transgender operations: Where they’re allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn him into a male — to a female — without parental consent.”', 'There is no evidence that schools in any part of the United States have sent children for gender-affirming surgeries without their parents’ approval, or performed unapproved such surgeries on-site; none of that is “allowed” anywhere in the country. Even in the states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.', 'Trump’s own campaign has not been able to find a single example of this ever having happened anywhere in the United States. You can read more here.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nFact check: Trump revives his lie that schools are secretly sending children for gender-affirming surgeries', 'Alyssa Farah Griffin: Trump told a thoroughly false story about a former official in his administration, Alyssa Farah Griffin, who is now a co-host of the ABC talk show “The View” and a political commentator on CNN. Trump claimed Griffin worked in the administration as “like an assistant press secretary”; that, upon leaving the administration, she “writes me this gorgeous letter,” “the most beautiful letter,” declaring “he was the greatest president”; but then, upon joining “The View,” that she suddenly started “hitting the hell out of me” with criticism.', 'This is untrue in several ways.', 'Griffin had the top-tier role of White House communications director and assistant to the president upon her resignation in late 2020, not “assistant press secretary” (she had previously been Pentagon press secretary and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary).', 'Griffin did issue a statement upon her resignation saying, “It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve in the Trump administration over the last three and a half years,” but did not say that Trump was “the greatest president.” She said Saturday that she has never written Trump a private letter.', 'And she began sharply criticizing Trump shortly after the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, not when she started guest-hosting “The View” in October 2021 or when she was named a permanent co-host in August 2022.', 'Abraham Lincoln’s sons: Trump told a story about how President Abraham Lincoln was a “very depressed” person in part because he lost his son “whose name was Tad.” Trump repeated later in the story that Lincoln lost his son “Tad.” In fact, Tad Lincoln outlived Abraham Lincoln by six years; the son Abraham Lincoln lost in 1862 was Willie. (This appeared to be an inadvertent mistake by Trump, but his claim was still inaccurate, and Trump has repeatedly bashed Biden over such mix-ups.)', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Trump had been scheduled to appear at a town hall this month hosted by Tony Robbins, a longtime self-help guru with over 7 million followers on Instagram, before Robbins postponed the event because of an incoming hurricane.', ""In an election being fought along narrow margins, Trump's campaign hopes that growing his support among male voters will help narrow the gap. Since 2020, his support among men — including Black and Hispanic men — has increased to a 16-percentage-point margin over Harris (56%-40%), according to the latest NBC News poll.

"Aliens, North Korea, election interference: Takeaways from Trump's Rogan appearance",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/26/joe-rogan-donald-trump-aliens-north-korea/75864009007/,"['This story has been updated to add additional context.', 'Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recorded a nearly three-hour long interview with mega-podcaster Joe Rogan on Friday, discussing everything from extraterrestrial aliens and life on Mars to election interference, and foreign policy. ', 'With just days to go before the presidential election, Trump’s appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” marks part of play by his campaign to target young, undecided male voters. Rogan’s show is Spotify’s top podcast with 14.5 million followers. More than 80% of Rogan’s listeners are male, and 56% are under age 35, according to a 2026 poll by YouGov. ', 'Throughout the interview, Trump sought to court the key demographic with references to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, mentions of his sense of humor, and plans to eliminate taxes.  ', 'Rogan rarely pressed Trump with tough questions about his record during the interview, and at one point told the former president: “I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy.”', 'Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.', 'Rogan signaled support for Kennedy’s presidential campaign when he was still running as an independent. Kennedy dropped out and endorsed Trump earlier this year.  ', 'Vice President Kamala Harris was in discussions about appearing on Rogan’s podcast, but a spokesperson for her campaign said that would not be possible because of scheduling issues. Rogan told Trump that he still believes Harris might appear on the show.  ', 'Here’s a breakdown of some of the key moments and major takeaways from Trump’s lengthy conversation with Rogan.  ', 'Rogan asked Trump whether he had been given information about extraterrestrial life while he was president. Trump said he had interviewed pilots who said they had seen strange objects while in the air.  ', ""“There's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” Trump said. Rogan pushed back slightly, arguing that the U.S. has had probes and rovers on Mars’ surface for decades. Scientists so far have not found direct evidence of life on the red planet.  "", ""“I don't think there's any life there,” Rogan said, to which Trump replied: “Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.” "", 'The Pentagon earlier this year released a 63-page report concluding that there was no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology on Earth. The report found that there was no reason to believe the U.S. government is hiding information about aliens. ', 'Trump repeated concerns that the “enemy from within” the country poses a more dangerous threat than foreign governments – this time talking about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  ', '“I got along great with him,” Trump told Rogan during the interview. Trump was the first president ever to step foot inside North Korea.  ', '“I say to people, we have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within. And it drives them crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within,” Trump later said.  ', 'Trump has previously used the phrase “enemy from within” in reference to his political opponents, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is running for the Senate.  ', 'Rogan and Trump touched on several policy topics during the interview, including taxes and the environment. ', 'In one instance, Rogan asked Trump if he was serious about his suggestion to eliminate income taxes and replace them with tariffs.  ', 'Trump responded: “Sure, why not?” ', 'Trump has argued for returning to the period before 1909, when there was no federal income tax. On the podcast with Rogan, he praised former President William McKinley for signing a law in 1890 that increased tariffs, the tax rate on foreign goods, to roughly 49%.  ', 'Some economists credit McKinley’s tariffs with plunging the U.S. government into a deficit and depression a few years later in 1893.  ', 'Today, replacing income tax with a tariff policy could substantially increase the current federal deficit. The federal government collected just under $2.18 trillion in income taxes in 2023, accounting for roughly 49% of its total revenue. Trump’s tariffs are expected to generate around $300 billion a year – about nine times less than the revenue received from income tax.  ', 'Rogan at one point in the interview echoed Trump’s claims that there was a “a lot of crooked stuff,” during the 2020 presidential election. He asked Trump: “How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off.” ', 'At first, Trump said that he’d rather have the conversation ""another time,” saying that he would bring in “so many different papers"" to back up his arguments. But when pressed by Rogan for examples of election interference, Trump repeated debunked claims of wrongful acts by state governments and fraud.  ', 'Rogan questioned whether Trump planned to ever present evidence of interference, but the conversation quickly changed course into a discussion about Hunter Biden, who was convicted on three felony counts in his federal gun trial. ', 'Trump and the podcast host later discussed unfounded concerns about vulnerabilities with mail-in voting and the security of voting machines.  ', ""“Let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud. One of them is mail-in ballots. The other one is if someone can break into voting machines,” Rogan said.  "", 'Use of mail-in voting has been on the rise since the 1980s and expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Voter fraud by mail is rare. All mail-in ballots are verified and counted and are linked to an eligible voter.  ', 'Voting machines have also been used for decades. Older machines have prompted concerns about hacking, though election officials say such a feat would be difficult.  ', 'Trump told Rogan that the “biggest mistake” he made during his presidency was appointing officials he “shouldn’t have picked” for roles in the White House and his cabinet.  ', 'Namely, Trump was talking about John Kelly, his former chief of staff and one-time Secretary of Homeland Security, and John Bolton, Trump’s former National Security Adviser.  ', 'He called Kelly a ""bully but a weak, weak person,"" and said Bolton was an ""idiot.""', '""Every time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, \'Oh man, Trump\'s going to go to war with us,\'"" Trump added of Bolton.', 'Kelly in interviews with the New York Times said Trump exhibited tendencies of a fascist and confirmed reports that Trump had spoken positively about Adolf Hitler. Kelly told the Times that Trump “commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too.’” ', 'Bolton has said Trump poses “dangers” if he is elected president again.  ', 'Rogan during the interview downplayed the reports about Trump’s Hitler comments.  ', ""He told Trump: “They continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy and Hitler. They kept saying you're going to be a dictator, ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the four years where you were actually the president.” "", 'Trump said that he was “the opposite of a dictator.” ']"

He talked about arriving in Washington and not knowing what to do with himself.', '“I had no experience,” he said. “I was there 17 times in Washington, and I never stayed over, according to the press, which I think is probably right… So now I’m sitting there, I’m saying, ‘This place is gorgeous,’ but, you know, I don’t know anybody.”', 'He wasn’t a “Washington guy”, Trump said, but a “New York builder”, a fixture of Fifth Avenue and his tower that stands in the middle of it.', '“I didn’t know the Washington world too well. And all of a sudden, you’re supposed to be appointing top people,” he said. As a result he “picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked”, describing them “neocons or bad people or disloyal people”.', 'According to research by the Brookings Institution, Trump had a turnover of 92 per cent in the executive office over his time as president, compared with President Obama’s 71 per cent and President Bush’s 63 per cent.', 'To Trump, 78, the word “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. “It’s more beautiful than love, more beautiful than anything,” he said.', 'When asked by Rogan whether he would get rid of income taxes and replace them with tariffs — an idea he mentioned earlier in the week on Fox News — Trump said: “Why not?” He added: “In the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax.”', 'A central piece of Trump’s economic plan seems to be a tax overhaul with proposals to bin the income tax scheme. According to the Tax Foundation, Trump’s overall tax plan could add as much as $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in over a decade.', 'This year the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, put his money on Trump: $75 million of it. To Trump, he is “the greatest guy”.', 'The former president told Rogan of when he first became aware of the Tesla and SpaceX founder, watching the coverage of one of his rockets landing.', '“I’m talking to this very important guy, I said, ‘Wait a minute, I’m looking at something.’ The television’s unmuted,” Trump said.', '“And I see this rocket. It’s all brown from the heat, 10,000 degrees pouring down at thousands of miles an hour… And I say to this guy, this important guy, ‘Wait a minute. Let me just put you down. Hold on. I got to see this.’”', 'After watching it successfully land, he “forgot the guy” and called Musk instead. “Was that you?’ He said, ‘That was me.’ And I said, ‘Who else can do that?’ He said, ‘Nobody. Russia can’t do it. The United States. Nobody can do it.’”', 'The rest is history.', '“I want to talk about 2020 because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020,” said Rogan, his attempt to catch the president’s attention within his weave.', 'In response, Trump continued to double down on his claims of election fraud in 2020, despite scant evidence.', '“That election was so crooked,” he said. “They say I lost by 22,000 votes. That’s like one tenth of one per cent less than that. It’s a tiny little thing.”', '• Who will win the 2024 US election? Polls and predictions', 'Rogan seemed to concur, saying that doubting the validity of the vote count was equivalent to questioning the coronavirus vaccines. “You get labelled an election denier,” said the former martial arts fighter. “It’s like being labelled an antivaxer.”', 'The former president also spoke about his exercise schedule, which largely takes place around a putting green.', '“I was never one that could run on a treadmill,” he said. “And I can do it. You know, when passing a physical, they ask me to run on a treadmill, and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper. And the doctors said, it was at Walter Reed, they said, ‘It’s unbelievable.’”', 'He could go “all day long” if he wanted. “But it’s really boring.”', 'In 2019, Trump became the first sitting US president to set foot on North Korean soil, where he said he initially got off to a rocky start with Kim Jong-un.', '“I said, ‘Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.’ And it was rough,” Trump said. “I got to know him better than anybody, anybody. And I said, ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach?’ You know, kiddingly, I said, ‘You’re always building nuclear. Just relax. You don’t have to do it. Let’s build some condos.’”', 'Before the White House, there was The Apprentice. Trump was the host of the first 14 seasons, fired by NBC in 2015 during his presidential run after remarks he made about Mexican immigrants.', 'In his interview with Rogan, however, Trump claimed that in the face of his designs on the presidency, the leadership team tried to persuade him to stick to TV instead.', '“They wanted me to stay, they all came to see me, they said, “We’re going to give you a contract,” he said.', 'He claimed that Mark Burnett, chairman of MGM Worldwide Television Group, told him: “You’re crazy, don’t run, don’t run, nobody gives up prime time.”', 'It was a “hot show”, he said.

‘A lot of fun’: will Trump’s rambling Joe Rogan interview rally young men?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-interview-analysis,"['Trump came across as old and unintelligent, but he was politically unscathed by a softball interview', 'In an interview in which Donald Trump said that he wants to be “a whale psychologist”, made the case for replacing income tax with tariffs and praised Confederate general Robert E Lee as a “genius”, the most striking thing about the former president’s encounter with podcaster Joe Rogan wasn’t the content as much as the length.', 'Over three hours, perhaps the longest ever campaign interview with a presidential candidate, Trump said very little that was factual but revealed a surprising amount about his disposition and his thinking should he return to office.', 'The Republican nominee’s appearance on Rogan makes smart political sense. Rogan, a commentator on Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcasts and comedian, began podcasting in 2009 and is now the most successful host in history. The Joe Rogan Experience is continually atop the global charts on both Apple and Spotify, earning almost half a billion dollars from deals with the latter.', 'For months now, the Democrats and their nominee, Kamala Harris, have been polling surprisingly poorly with young men compared with previous election cycles, creating consternation among party insiders. Rogan reaches the kind of politically skeptical young men with low trust in Washington DC – and in the news media that both parties believe could help them reach the White House.', 'That’s why at the start of the week, with polls tightening and Democrats concerned they may be “blowing” the election, the rumours were that it would be Harris who would appear on the podcast. It could have been one of the few media appearances that actually shifts the conversation and could have won over some undecideds. But her team eventually backed out of an appearance, perhaps concerned about the long freewheeling format. So it was announced that it would be Trump who would appear on the show.', 'Rogan’s initial questioning of Trump was inquisitive and unexpected. He asked about what it felt like entering the White House with no political experience. Trump responded honestly, saying it was more surreal than later being shot in the tip of one of his ears. He said that he “had made his money largely on luxury” and that he was amazed by how beautiful it was inside. He talked about the difficulties of transition for a non-politician who had “no experience and no idea who to appoint”. He sympathised with Mary Todd Lincoln’s “melancholia”. It seemed like Rogan’s inquisitive style might get something new from the former president.', 'But very quickly the interview descended into a long, rambling and often boring venture through Trump’s greatest hits. He demonised migrants, spoke warmly about Vladimir Putin and falsely claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Rogan tried to push him on nuclear power and the environment. But Trump only wanted to discuss how ugly he finds windfarms – and how their vibrations upset the whales – and the ways in which environmental regulations would stop him getting permits for his buildings in New York.', 'In May, pollsters for the New York Times/Siena College analysed their data to see what were the key predictors for why a voter who supported Joe Biden when he defeated Trump in 2020 might defect to the Republican against Harris.', 'They found that the No 1 predictor was whether the voter was born in the Middle East, a reflection of the Democrats’ position on the war in Gaza. The No 2 predictor was whether they had a favorable view of Rogan. For some young male voters, he’s their main source of political information.', 'Rogan himself is a political riddle. He’s a conspiracy theorist and an anti-vaxxer and so is often painted as rightwing or Trump-supporting – but he’s actually got a complex and often conflicting set of beliefs. He fiercely defends abortion rights, gay marriage and gun rights. He’s gravitated toward outsider candidates like Bernie Sanders and RFK Jr – he voted for the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in the previous election. In 2022, Rogan described Trump as an “existential threat to democracy”.', 'Harris, who has been struggling to define herself with voters, may have found the relaxed atmosphere helpful – especially as Rogan tends to always agree with what his guests say.', 'He allowed to Trump brazenly lie – about election fraud, the deficit, his tax policy and many other issues – without ever challenging him. He also appeared to agree with him on many positions that he’s previously taken the opposite stance and painted election deniers as an oppressed group, saying: “You get labelled, it’s like being labelled an anti-vaxxer.”', 'Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition', 'The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election', '', 'The pair discussed Rogan’s previous support for RFK Jr, who Trump promised could do “whatever” when it came to health policy in his administration, which placated the podcast host but may concern the mainstream scientific and medical community against whom Kennedy has railed.', 'Rogan had one good moment as an interviewer, asking Trump if he was ever going to “present” his supposed evidence of election tampering. But he let Trump ramble on to a different topic: Hunter Biden’s laptop.', 'Because of this easy ride, Trump came off sounding old, doddering and unintelligent – but politically unscathed. He was allowed to blame all of America’s ills on Democrats and paint himself as a great leader. He attacked Harris, calling her “low IQ” and that she “couldn’t put two sentences together”. She was one of a number of women whom Trump and Rogan dismissed as “stupid”, perhaps with a nod to the young misogynist voters who could be persuaded to vote for the former president.', 'For the most part, Rogan – not the smartest cookie himself – simply nodded along. He finished by saying having Trump on was “a lot of fun”.', 'For anyone else who made it through all three hours, that might have been the biggest lie of all.']"

I do a lot of shows and they come out good.""', 'That response makes light of the Trump campaign’s calculated media strategy, which has focused on podcasts popular with younger men over traditional media outlets like 60 Minutes.', 'And it underplays just how big a deal this could be for the former president, long-time listeners say.', '""Rogan is about to have the most listened-to podcast in human history,"" says Matthew Foldi, a conservative journalist and self-styled JRE expert who has spent thousands of hours listening to the entire catalogue - in chronological order and at 3.5x speed - since 2020.', 'A New Jersey native, Rogan began his career as a stand-up comedian in the Boston area before relocating to California in the 1990s. He featured in two sitcoms - Hardball and NewsRadio - and gained national exposure as host of the US edition of the Fear Factor game show.', 'He became one of the first comics to venture into podcasting in 2009, quickly building an audience with his easy-going conversation style and sense of humour. By 2020, he had signed one of the largest licensing deals in the business, with Spotify, where he has dominated the podcasting ranks.', 'Known for discussing everything from current affairs and politics to aliens and drug use, Rogan hosts an ideologically diverse mix of guests – from astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson to far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to comedians like Chris Rock and Kevin Hart - in lengthy hours-long interviews.', 'Part of his appeal, says Kat Rosenfield, a freelance culture writer and novelist, is his willingness to talk to anyone, about anything.', '""He is very naturally curious. He wants to ask questions. He wants to know what\'s up with his guests and he has good instincts to make it an engaging listen.""', 'But his willingness to absorb contrarian perspectives has also landed him in hot water.', 'During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was criticised for promoting vaccine scepticism, leading to a coalition of medical experts to call out Spotify for allowing “false and societally harmful assertions” to spread.', 'In 2022, musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell removed their music from Spotify in protest over Rogan’s use of the platform to spread alleged Covid misinformation.

Lee, whom Trump has talked fondly of in the past. Without specifics, Trump said that generals he talks to think Lee was a “genius.” At that point, Rogan asked Trump to clarify that he only meant “strategically,” which Trump concurred with.', 'Later in the interview, Rogan suggested that Trump’s Lee comment could lead to criticism.', '“Donald Trump wishes the South won,” Rogan said, mimicking what he thought the criticism might sound like.', '“The Joe Rogan Experience,” which launched in 2009, is of one the most popular podcasts in the United States, particularly among young men.', 'The episodes, which are usually hours long, feature a wide array of guests from various industries, including entertainment, sports, tech and politics.', 'Rogan, a former stand-up comedian and host of “Fear Factor,” has built a robust following as an unlikely political pundit.

Kennedy Jr., but later clarified in a post on X that he wasn’t endorsing the then-independent candidate. Kennedy later dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.', 'Harris had also been in talks to do an interview with Rogan, but they didn’t pan out. Ian Sams, a spokesman for her campaign, told MSNBC on Thursday, “We talked with Rogan and his team about the podcast. Unfortunately, it isn’t going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this period of the campaign.”', 'Trump, who is not known as a humble person, seemed to acknowledge the importance of being on Rogan’s podcast, at one point referring to himself as “a student of yours.”', 'On the environment, Trump said that environmental regulations are “the biggest tool to stopping growth,” and continued to attack his long-running nemesis, the windmill, for what he said is its harmful impact on wildlife. In this case, Trump said he was worried about the impact of windmills on whales.', '“I want to be a whale psychiatrist,” he said. “It drives the whales freaking crazy if something happens with them, but they’re getting washed up and yet the environmentalists they don’t talk about, right?”', 'He also continued to personally assault Harris, calling her “not smart” and framing her as a bigger threat to the nation than even foreign adversaries.', '“If she becomes the president of the United States, which I can’t believe can happen,” Trump said, “I don’t think this country is going to make it.”', 'Trump has increasingly called Harris “stupid,” and during a Thursday-night rally in Las Vegas, he said her policies would “kill thousands of people.”', 'Yet on Friday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky issued a letter calling on Harris to tone down the rhetoric. They argued that Trump could face a third assassination attempt as a result of heated campaign talk.', '“Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist,’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before election day,” the two wrote.', 'The letter did not mention that Trump has applied that term to Harris on multiple occasions.', 'As the third hour of the interview approached, Trump said he realized he needed to get to a scheduled rally in Michigan, which he was late for because of the length of the Rogan interview.', '“I’ve got to go make a great speech,” Trump said. “And If I’m a little off tonight, I’m going to blame you.”', 'Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.', '© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
