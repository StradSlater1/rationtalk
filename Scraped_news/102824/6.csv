You’re not going to take it anymore. You’re the worst vice-president,” Trump said. “You’re just horrible, Kamala. You’re fired. Get out of here.”', 'Echoing Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris is trying to draw a through-line between her ancestors in the civil rights movement, her work to preserve reproductive freedom and gen Z’s advocacy around a host of issues.', '“You, who have only known the climate crisis, are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep our schools safe. You, who now know fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers, are standing up for reproductive freedom.

I think that alone is disqualfiying. If you’ve engaged in that kind of activity in the private sector, you should not be a public official at any level.”', 'The Casey campaign released an ad this week highlighting claims that McCormick attempted to silence or retaliate against female employees of Bridgewater who came forward with harassment claims.', 'Casey’s campaign manager also penned a letter calling on McCormick to demand that Bridgewater release employees who reported harassment from their non-disclosure agreements.', '“It is your responsibility to ensure the voters of Pennsylvania have complete information about your record before casting their votes,” Tiernan Donohue, Casey’s campaign manager, wrote in the letter. “They deserve the full story.”', 'Speaking to reporters after his event with the Carpenters Union, Senator Bob Casey said he believes the momentum and enthusiasm on the ground in Pennsylvania will lift Democrats to victory in 10 days.', '“I think it is close.

But today the government is increasingly on the back foot, with the loss of dozens of outposts, bases and strategic cities that even its leaders concede would be challenging to take back.\n“The military is on the defensive all over the country, and every time it puts its energy into one part of the country, it basically has to shift troops and then is vulnerable in other parts,” said Connor Macdonald of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar advocacy group.\n“To us it doesn’t look like there’s any viable route back for the military to recapture any of the territory that it’s lost.”\nThe military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy.\nThe army’s takeover also sparked the formation of pro-democracy militias known as People’s Defense Forces. They support the opposition National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats after the army takeover.\nBut until the launch of Operation 1027, eponymously named for its Oct. 27 start, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, had largely been able to prevent major losses around the country.\nOperation 1027 brought coordinated attacks from three of the most powerful ethnic armed groups, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance: the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army. The alliance quickly captured towns and overran military bases and outposts along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state.\nTwo weeks later, the Arakan Army launched attacks in its western home state of Rakhine, and since then other militia groups and PDFs have joined in around the country.\nMyanmar’s military has been pushed back to the country’s center\nA year after the offensive began, resistance forces now fully or partially control a vast horseshoe of territory. It starts in Rakhine state in the west, runs across the north and then heads south into Kayah and Kayin states along the Thai border. The Tatmadaw has pulled back toward central Myanmar, around the capital Naypyidaw and largest city of Yangon.\n“I never thought our goals would be achieved so quickly,” Lway Yay Oo, spokesperson for the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, told The Associated Press. “We only thought that we would attack the military council together to the extent we could, but it has been easier than expected so we’ve been able to conquer more quickly.”\nAlong the way, the Tatmadaw has suffered some humiliating defeats, including the loss of the city of Laukkai in an assault in which the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured more than 2,000 troops, including six generals; and of the city of Lashio, which had been home to the military’s Northeast Command.\n“The 1027 offensive was a highly impressive operation, quite complex, and the use of drones played a big role because basically they were able to dismantle the military’s network of fire-support bases across northern Shan,” said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project.\n“And then, once the military’s artillery support eroded, they were able to overrun harder targets like towns and battalion headquarters.”\nA year later, the military is “substantially weakened,” he said, but it’s too early to write it off.\nThe military has been weakened, but not defeated\nThe Tatmadaw has managed to claw back the town of Kawlin in the Sagaing region, which had fallen in the first days of the 1027 offensive, stave off an attack by three ethnic Karenni militias on Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state, and has retained administrative control of Myawaddy, a key border crossing with Thailand, after holding off an assault by one ethnic group with the assistance of a rival militia.\nMany expect the military to launch a counteroffensive when the rainy season soon comes to an end, bolstered by some 30,000 new troops since activating conscription in February and its complete air superiority.\nBut at the same time, resistance groups are closing in on Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, in the center of the country.\nAnd where they might be out-gunned, they have gained strength, hard-won experience and confidence over the last year, said the Ta’ang National Liberation Army’s Lway Yay Oo.\n“We have military experience on our side, and based on this experience we can reinforce the fighting operation,” she said.\nThet Swe, a spokesperson for the military regime, conceded it will be a challenge for the Tatmadaw to dislodge the Three Brotherhood Alliance from the territory it has gained.\n“We cannot take it back during one year,” he told the AP in an emailed answer to questions. “However, I hope that I will give you a joyful message ... in (the) coming two or three years.”\nCivilian casualties rise as the military turns more to indiscriminate strikes\nAs the military has faced setbacks in the fighting on the ground, it has been increasingly relying on indiscriminate air and artillery strikes, resulting in a 95 percent increase in civilian deaths from airstrikes and a 170 percent increase in civilians killed by artillery since the 1027 offensive began, according to a report last month by the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe Tatmadaw has been accused of deliberately targeting civilians whom it believes support the resistance militias, a tactic that is only turning more against them, said Isabel Todd, coordinator for the SAC-M group.\n“It doesn’t seem to be having the effect that they want it to have,” she said. “It’s making them even more hated by the population and really strengthening the resolve to ensure that this is the end of the Myanmar military as it’s known.”\nMilitary spokesperson Thet Swe denied targeting civilians, saying it was militia groups that were responsible for killing civilians and burning villages.\nHundreds of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting, and there are now more than 3 million internally displaced people in Myanmar overall, and some 18.6 million people in need, according to the UN\nAt the same time, the 2024 humanitarian response plan is only 1/3 funded, hindering the delivery of aid, said Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs operation in Myanmar.\n“The humanitarian outlook for the next year is grim, and we anticipate that the deteriorating situation will have a massive impact on the protection of civilians,” he said in an interview.\nIn some areas, however, the offensive has eased pressure, like northwestern Chin state, which borders Bangladesh and India and had previously been the focus of many of the Tatmadaw’s operations, said Salai Htet Ni, a spokesperson for the Chin National Front whose armed wing has been involved in fighting the military.\n“In October of last year the military convoys that were going up into the Chin mountains were withdrawn,” he said. “As a result of the 1027 operation there have been almost no major military activities.”\nSuccess brings new tensions between resistance groups\nAs the front has expanded it has seen militias advancing out of their own ethnic areas, like when Rakhine-based Arakan Army in January seized the Chin town of Paletwa, which has given rise to some friction between groups, foreshadowing possible future strife should the Tatmadaw eventually fall.\nIn the case of Paletwa, Salai Htet Ni said his group was happy that the AA took it from the Tatmadaw, but added that there should have been negotiations before they began operating in Chin territory and that the AA should now bring Chin forces in to help administer the area.\n“Negotiations are mandatory for these regional administration issues,” he said. “But we will negotiate this case through dialogue, not military means.”\nAt the moment there is a degree of solidarity between the different ethnic groups as they focus on a common enemy, but Aung Thu Nyein, director of communications for the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar think tank said that does not translate to common aspirations.\nShould the Tatmadaw fall, it could lead to the fragmentation of Myanmar unless the groups work hard to resolve political and territorial differences.\n“As far as I see, there is no established mechanism to resolve the issues,” he said. “The resistance being able to bring down the junta is unlikely, but I cannot discount this scenario, (and) if we cannot build trust and common goals, it could lead to the scenario of Syria.”\nChinese interests and ties with both sides complicate the picture\nComplicating the political picture is the influence of neighboring China, which is believed to have tacitly supported the 1027 offensive in what turned out to be a successful bid to largely shut down organized crime activities that had been flourishing along its border.\nIn January, Beijing used its close ties with both the Tatmadaw and the Three Brotherhood groups to negotiate a ceasefire in northern Shan, which lasted for five months until the ethnic alliance opened phase two of the 1027 offensive in June, accusing the military of violating the ceasefire.\nChina has been displeased with the development, shutting down border crossings, cutting electricity to Myanmar towns and taking other measures in a thus-far unsuccessful attempt to end the fighting.\nIts support for the regime also seems to be growing, with China’s envoy to Myanmar urging the powerful United Wa State Army, which wasn’t involved in the 1027 offensive or related fighting, to actively pressure the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army to halt the renewed offensive, according to leaked details of an August meeting widely reported by local media.\nThere is no evidence that the UWSA has done that, however.\n“The idea that the northern groups and the Three Brotherhood Alliance etc. are somehow just agents of China is a complete misconception,” Todd said.\n“They have their own objectives which they are pursuing that are independent of what China may or may not want them to do, and that’s apparent in the incredible amount of pressure that China has put on them recently.”\nBecause of the grassroot support for the resistance, it is less vulnerable to outside influence, said Kyaw Zaw, a spokesperson for the opposition National Unity Government.\n“No matter who is putting pressure on us, we are winning because of the power of the people,” he said.', 'The United States and the European Union called for a full investigation into reports of violations in an election in Georgia, where the president urged protests on Monday following the disputed parliamentary vote.\nThe results, with almost all precincts counted, were a blow for pro-Western Georgians who had cast the election as a choice between a ruling party that has deepened ties with Russia and an opposition aiming to fast-track integration with Europe.\nPresident Salome Zourabichvili urged people to take to the streets to protest against the results of Saturday’s disputed parliamentary election, which the electoral commission said the ruling party had won.\nThe ruling Georgian Dream party, of which Zourabichvili is a fierce critic, clinched nearly 54 percent of the vote, the commission said, as opposition parties contested the outcome and vote monitors reported significant violations.\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States joined calls from observers for a full probe.\n“Going forward, we encourage Georgia’s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together,” Blinken said in a statement.\nEarlier, the European Union urged Georgia to swiftly and transparently investigate the alleged irregularities in the vote.\n“The EU recalls that any legislation that undermines the fundamental rights and freedoms of Georgian citizens and runs counter to the values and principles upon which the EU is founded, must be repealed,” the European Commission said in a joint statement with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\nZourabichvili, a former Georgian Dream ally who won the 2018 presidential vote as an independent, urged Georgians to protest in the center of the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday evening, to show the world “that we do not recognize these elections.”\nFor years, Georgia was one of the most pro-Western countries to emerge from the Soviet Union, with polls showing many Georgians disliking Russia for its support of two breakaway regions of their country.\nRussia defeated Georgia in their brief war over the rebel province of South Ossetia in 2008.\nThe election result poses a challenge to the EU’s ambition to expand by bringing in more former Soviet states.\nLast week, Moldova narrowly approved its EU accession in a vote Moldovan officials said was marred by Russian interference.', 'MELBOURNE, Australia: A woman appeared in an Australian court on Monday charged with a May assault on the Indigenous senator who shouted at King Charles III during a royal reception last week.\nThe assault allegedly occurred on May 25, when independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe attended an Australian Rules Football match in her hometown of Melbourne.\nEbony Bell, 28, appeared by a video link in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. She has been charged with two counts of recklessly causing injury and three counts of unlawful assault at a stadium.\nA police statement described the 51-year-old senator’s injuries from the alleged assault as “minor.”\nBut she said in a statement to the AP on Monday she had “sustained serious nerve and spinal injuries in my neck, which required spinal surgery and a plate to be inserted.”\nThe assault was reported to police the next day and Bell was arrested on July 25. The women knew each other, but the motive for the alleged attack was not explained in court.\nBell’s lawyer Manny Nicolosi told Magistrate Belinda Franjic the prosecution case had “real deficiencies.” He said the prosecution had on Friday made an “offer,” an apparent reference to a plea deal.\n“I haven’t had enough time to really consider it,” Nicolosi told the court.\nNicolosi explained that his Indigenous client hadn’t appeared in court in person because of “recent threats.” The lawyer did not elaborate on those threats.\nBell remains free on bail until she appears in court next on Nov. 22. The magistrate agreed to allow her to appear again by video.\nThorpe made her first public statement about the alleged assault after she launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles during a reception in Australian Parliament House in Canberra last week.\n“You are not our king. You are not sovereign,” Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception.\n“You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,” she added.\nThe main opposition party has called for Thorpe to resign from the Senate due to her attitude toward Charles, who is Australia’s head of state, and have requested legal advice.\nThorpe is renowned for high-profile protest action. When she was affirmed as a senator in 2022, she wasn’t allowed to describe the then-monarch as “the colonizing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.” She briefly blocked a police float in Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Madri Gras last year by lying on the street in front of it. Last year, she was also banned for life from a Melbourne strip club after video emerged of her shouting abuse at male patrons.\nShe revealed her injuries after The Australian newspaper reported she had missed 16 of the Senate’s 44 sitting days this year.\n“I was ordered by the doctor not to travel and could not attend parliament after I sustained the injury and during recovery from surgery. My doctor told me to take time off work,” her statement said.\n“I would have preferred to keep this matter private and I will not be commenting on it further at this stage,” she added.\nThorpe was widely criticized for being disrespectful to the monarch during her outburst last week.\nShe faces a further backlash next week when senators sit for the first time since the royal visit.\nHer office said Monday she has not decided whether she plans to attend senate committee meetings in person or remotely.\nShe also raised questions about the validity of her appointment to the Senate when she recently said she had deliberately affirmed her allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II and her “hairs,” rather than “heirs,” during her affirmation ceremony in 2022 to exclude Charles. Thorpe later walked back that statement, saying the mispronunciation was accidental.\nLawyers agree that a mispronunciation did not invalidate an affirmation and that Thorpe also signed a written version of the affirmation of allegiance with the correct wording.\nSydney University constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said the Senate’s ability to discipline Thorpe was limited because her outburst occurred outside the chamber in Parliament’s Great Hall.', 'MOSCOW: Russia said Sunday its military had advanced further in east Ukraine, capturing a frontline village just a few kilometers north of a key Ukrainian-held industrial hub.\nMoscow has made steady gains on the battlefield for months, pressing its advantage against overstretched and outmanned Ukrainian forces.\nRussian army units “liberated the settlement of Izmailovka,” the Russian defense ministry said in a daily briefing, using the Russian spelling for the village.\nIzmailivka had a population of just under 200 people before the conflict.\nIt lies eight kilometers (five miles) north of the key industrial hub of Kurakhove and just a few kilometers north of Kurakhivka, a small town on a stretch of frontline Moscow is trying to surround.\nThe announcement was followed by Russia on Monday claiming it downed 109 Ukrainian drones in a day over several of its regions, including near the border.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that Moscow would “respond” if the West allowed Ukraine to use longer-range weapons against his territory.\n“It’s too early to say yet, but of course our military department is thinking about it and will offer various responses,” Putin told a state TV reporter in remarks aired Sunday.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has for months been asking his Western allies for permission to use long-range missiles against targets deep inside Russian territory, arguing the move would “motivate” Moscow to seek peace.\nThe United States and Britain signalled a decision on the matter was imminent last month, but later delayed the move after Putin warned they risked putting NATO “at war” with Moscow.\nPutin said on Sunday he hoped the West had listened to that warning.\n“They didn’t tell me anything about it, but I hope they heard,” the Russian leader said.', ""109 drones downed\nIn a statement, Russia's defense ministry said a total of 45 drones were intercepted in the Briansk region, which borders Ukraine and Belarus, while 26 were destroyed to the south in Russia's Belgorod region.\nEighteen were downed in the Tambov region, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\nFive were intercepted in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops have been conducting a ground offensive since August and control several hundred square kilometres of Russian territory.\nOne person was lightly wounded when a drone crashed and caught fire at an industrial facility in Russia's western city of Voronezh, governor Alexander Gusev said.\nMore drones were downed elsewhere in Russia, which announces almost daily that it has destroyed Ukrainian UAVs.\nKyiv says the strikes, which often target energy infrastructure, are in response to Russian bombardments of Ukrainian territory.\n "", 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

Trump in Michigan makes play for Arab American and Muslim voters angry over war in Gaza,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/muslim-leaders-michigan-trump-endorse/index.html,"['', 'Former President Donald Trump on Saturday invited several Muslim leaders onstage with him at a campaign rally in Michigan as he courts Arab American and Muslim voters disillusioned or angry over US policy on Israel and Gaza in the critical battleground state.', '“They could turn the election one way or the other,” Trump said in the Detroit suburb of Novi, located about a half hour from Dearborn, which last year became the first Arab-majority city in the US.', 'Trump said in his speech that he had held a meeting earlier in the day with Muslim leaders. He was joined onstage by what his campaign described as “prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,” including Imam Belal Alzuhairi, who described Trump as the “peace” candidate.', '“We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace – he promises peace, not war,” Alzuhairi said. “We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.”', 'Trump has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza on public relations grounds, saying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his military need to “get it over with fast.” He has also slammed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for not adequately supporting Israel, though the current administration – and Harris’ campaign – has largely refused to criticize Israel or consider halting weapons shipments to the country.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nWith worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict', 'In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel, Trump mused about real estate prospects in beleaguered Gaza, home to roughly 2 million Palestinians.', '“You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,” Trump said. “It could be so beautiful.”', 'During his first month as president, in 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and blocked all refugees from entering the US for four months. (After a lengthy court battle, the “travel ban” survived in part. Biden revoked the orders in 2021 immediately after being sworn in.)', 'The Trump campaign and its allies, though, have sought to seize on Arab American and Muslim anger over continued US support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, more recently, Lebanon, by criticizing Harris and Biden from both sides – telling anti-war voters that Trump would secure peace and claiming to pro-Israel voters that the Democrats don’t have their back.', 'Trump has frequently questioned why Jewish Americans would consider voting for Harris, repeatedly saying that Jewish Democrats “should have their head examined.” At an event in September billed as opposing antisemitism, he even warned that “the Jewish people would have a lot to do” with his potential loss in November.', 'Harris, who has called for a ceasefire in Gaza and has said she supports a two-state solution in the region, has taken more heat from pro-Palestinian and anti-war activists, who have pleaded with her to break from Biden and say she supports conditioning military aid to Israel.', 'During a brief meeting three weeks ago in Flint, Michigan, a group of Arab American advocates and leaders pressed Harris “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with,” as Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Muslim American advocacy group Emgage Action, told CNN afterward.', 'Trump at his rally on Saturday claimed that “Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before and now the most wonderful thing is happening.”', '“The Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they want,” Trump said.', 'Trump also, again, used Harris’s recent round of campaigning alongside former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, whose father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, was one of the leading architects of the US invasion of Iraq and the yearslong war that followed. Both Cheneys have endorsed Harris.', 'Hours later, Harris, while campaigning in Kalamazoo, Michigan, was interrupted early in her speech by a protester, who shouted, “No more Gaza war.”', '“On the topic of Gaza, we must end that war. And we must end the war and bring the hostages home,” Harris said, as the audience tried to drown out the demonstrator.', 'This story has been updated with additional information.', 'CNN’s Alison Main contributed to this report.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Trump Touts Endorsement from ‘Great’ Anti-Israel Mayor,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-touts-endorsement-from-great-anti-israel-mayor/,"['National Review', 'The Madison Square Garden Smear', 'MAGA Nation Flocks to World’s Most Famous Arena, Turning Manhattan Red for a Moment', 'Medical Journal Trots Out Trite The Handmaid’s Tale Metaphor to Oppose Natalism', 'The Nation’s Interns Declare War on the Nation', 'On the Trump 2024 Campaign’s Effort to Humanize Trump', '“I think the mayor is great, and he’s given us his total endorsement,” Donald Trump said this week of Amer Ghalib, an Arab American who was elected America’s first Muslim mayor in Hamtramck, Mich., in 2021. “He’s somebody [who has] got a lot of future in this country.”', '“He’s not for men playing in women’s sports. He’s not for transgender operations — the transformation, or the transition into, you know, a male into a female. He’s not into that,” Trump continued. “I think for the most part, the Arab world isn’t into that, and I’m not into that either. But the radical left is totally into it.”', 'Trump’s promising mayor is staunchly anti-Israel. Ghalib’s city council voted unanimously in May to approve a resolution divesting from “Israeli apartheid,” a measure Ghalib said meant, “For now, the city will do its best to refrain from buying, investing or contracting with companies that support the Israeli genocide.” Hamtramck’s all-male and all-Muslim city council was one of the few in America to pass a divestment proposal. Ghalib said after the vote to divest that Palestine is “fighting for a good cause. Some people call them ‘terrorists,’ which doesn’t make no sense.” The only “ethical exit” for Israel “is to declare defeat and give it up and accept the exchange of prisoners and leave the people to live in their land,” Ghalib said in June, according to local media.', 'In September, Ghalib met with Trump before a town hall in Warren, Mich. He posted to Facebook a photo of himself with Trump, and said in the caption that “before taking this picture, [Trump] said: let me take a good picture with the greatest mayor in the whole world.”', 'Ghalib has accused President Joe Biden of perpetuating claims that Palestinian terrorists beheaded babies and raped Israeli women — claims Ghalib denies. “You fueled . . . Islamophobia by spreading false information and lies (e.g. beheaded babies and raped women),” Ghalib said. “You make us feel unsafe by trying to justify your support for the criminal and unethical attack on the civilians of Gaza using lies and made up stories. Be a man and apologize for your moral and historic downfall, otherwise the blood of thousands of children and innocent people will be a curse that will follow you to your grave.” Multiple autopsy reports, survivor testimonies, and photographic evidence prove that Hamas terrorists did behead, rape, assault, and maim Israeli civilians on October 7, 2023.', 'The mayor also pressed the city council to push a resolution renaming a town street to “Palestine Avenue,” as a “gesture of solidarity.” City councillors were deadlocked over the resolution, which Ghalib cast the tie-breaking vote to pass. Also, when city council candidate Nasr Hussain posted a disturbing message on Facebook — “Was the Holocaust God’s advance punishment of the ‘Chosen People’ for the savagery they’re committing today against the innocent Palestinians children and civilians? A heinous act proving that they’re as savage and cruel as the Nazis themselves, or even worse.” — Ghalib would not condemn the statement. “You can ask Nasr about that,” Ghalib said instead. “What do I have to do with his posts! I don’t have to comment on every resident’s opinion, otherwise I would have commented on some posts that insult Islam and other religions, which are posted frequently by some residents on that same Facebook group.”', 'Few women are involved in local Hamtramck politics. On his election night, the BBC reported:', 'Mr Ghalib, the mayor-elect, was surrounded by a jubilant Yemeni-American crowd in a post-election party serving baklava and kebabs. More than 100 supporters were there, all of them men.', 'Women participated in his campaign, Mr Ghalib said, but segregation of the sexes remains traditional, even as it is being challenged by younger generations who have become more “Americanised”, he said.', 'Some Muslim communities in Michigan have turned their backs on the Democratic ticket, because, they say, Biden has been too supportive of Israel. Trump, though, is a “man of principles” who doesn’t want war, Ghalib said — a compliment Trump is eager to tout.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2024 National Review', 'Newsletters', '']"
