AMD could be particularly important to watch if you trade anything in the tech sector as it could be a precursor to the Nvidia earnings next month and the Apple earnings later this week.', 'Wednesday Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Caterpillar (CAT) all report earnings.

But with the constant increase of consumer credit over the past several months it's possible that we could sell off on a beat of GDP. If we miss, we could see the market actually rally as it could mean more aggressive rate cuts are coming from the Fed."", 'Core PCE', ""Speaking of the Fed, Thursday their favorite measure of inflation, the PCE Price Index is out. This should provide a better view of whether the Fed truly has beaten inflation and if more rate cuts can continue. The forecasted number is an increase of 0.3% which is up from the previous increase of 0.1%. If this comes in higher than expected it's possible we see the market start to sell off as that would be a fairly hot PCE print. If we come in lower than expected we could see the market rally on a potential confirmation that the Fed is on the right track."", 'Unemployment rate/Non-Farm Payrolls', 'Both the Unemployment rate and the Non-Farm payrolls are out Friday morning, and much like JOLTS, this Non-farm report could cause a lot of volatility as it’s the last one before a fairly contentious election. If it comes in lower than forecasted, which is already low at 125,000 jobs, then we could see the market start to see some selling pressure. A match or a beat could have the opposite effect.

As earnings season heats up, several companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange are under the microscope. From emerging innovators to established market leaders, each faces unique challenges that will be revealed in their quarterly reports. The stakes are high, with market sentiment, stock prices, and future growth trajectories hanging in the balance. This quarter, Siyata Mobile (NASDAQ: SYTA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are at critical junctures that could shift the momentum of their stocks and influence broader market trends.', ""Siyata Mobile (NASDAQ: SYTA), a growing micro-cap, is set to take center stage on November 14 when it releases earnings. The company's aggressive strategy of partnering with major wireless carriers is being put to the test following a recently inked deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS). Siyata’s push-to-talk (PTT) technology promises to disrupt traditional communication methods, and investors are watching closely to see if these efforts result in significant revenue growth. CEO Marc Seelenfreund has touted the potential for transformation, but the company now faces its most pivotal moment. The upcoming earnings will reveal whether the capital raised to meet carrier demands will pay off or leave investors disappointed. To read a recent MicroCapReports article on Siyata Mobile, please visit: https://microcapreports.com/lander/siyata-mobile/"", 'Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) is a company striving to balance growth and cost control. As a prominent name in the electric vehicle (EV) market, Rivian has rapidly scaled its operations, but the rising costs of production are raising questions about long-term profitability. This quarter, the pressure is on for Rivian to deliver strong financial results that reassure investors about its capacity to manage expenses while continuing to grow its EV footprint. Rivian’s performance will be scrutinized as the company seeks to maintain its valuation and prove it can stand alongside giants like Tesla in the competitive EV space.', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a leader in the global EV market, faces increasing competition from both established automakers and new entrants. Despite being a market darling for years, Tesla’s margins are under pressure due to the rising costs of materials, increased production, and the need to invest in new technologies like autonomous driving and battery development. Investors will be looking for signs of resilience in Tesla’s earnings report, particularly in how the company manages competition and continues to grow its international market share while staying profitable.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a heavyweight in the tech sector, has enjoyed an extraordinary run as demand for its advanced chips surged alongside the rise of AI applications. However, recent regulatory pressures and slowing growth in consumer-facing products have placed Nvidia at a crossroads. This quarter, Nvidia must demonstrate that its strength in AI and data centers will continue to drive revenue growth, even as global chip demand cools. Investors are particularly eager to see whether Nvidia’s strategic investments in AI can maintain its dominant position in the semiconductor industry.', 'For each of these Nasdaq-listed companies, the upcoming earnings reports are far more than just financial check-ins—they are critical milestones that could determine the trajectory of these businesses in the near term. Whether they meet or exceed expectations will shape not only their individual stock movements but also broader market trends in sectors like technology, EVs, and AI.', 'As investor sentiment builds, market participants should prepare for a high-stakes season filled with opportunity, risk, and potential surprises.', 'About FN Media Group:', 'At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #tickertagpressreleases #pressreleases', 'Follow us on Facebook to receive the latest news updates: https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmedia\nFollow us on Twitter for real time Market News: https://twitter.com/FNMgroup\nFollow us on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/', ""DISCLAIMER: MicroCapReports is the originator of the content set forth above.

He also said not to forget about the nonfarm payroll report next Friday, where a weak hiring result could urge the Federal Reserve to keep cutting rates.', '“Huge opportunity,” he said. “Just please remember, the first move’s been the wrong move almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers and listen to the conference calls before you pull the trigger.”', 'Monday starts off the week with earnings from Ford\n. Cramer said he wishes the automaker giant will report a clean quarter with no issues from warranty costs and not too much lost on electric vehicles.', 'Tuesday brings McDonald’s earnings report, and Cramer said to expect “a full airing of the e-coli situation,” but that it is too early to tell how much damage it will do to the fast food chain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states.\n\nCramer predicts Royal Caribbean\n, Reddit\nand PayPal\nto all report a large beat and raise in year-end guidance.', 'Alphabet will report after the close on Tuesday. While the tech behemoth’s stock has been all over the map, Cramer said it has been “rarely in a good way.” He said Alphabet is a great company, but not a solid stock as the leadership doesn’t seem to prioritize what investors want to hear.\n\nCramer said he believes Advanced Micro Devices\nwill do well enough to take parts of Nvidia’s\nbusiness. Chipotle\nwill report its earnings for the first time since former-CEO Brian Niccol’s left the helm to run Starbucks\n, and Cramer said he believes announcing a permanent CEO would help the stock.', 'Another large slate of reports are set for Wednesday, including Caterpillar\nand Eli Lilly\n. Cramer said he saw the former’s machines all over Chevron’s floating platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but isn’t sure whether the likely strong report will be enough to move the already hot stock. The latter has had a strong run on the back of the GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, and Cramer said a Stifel report on the negative impact weight-loss drugs may have on food stock means Eli Lilly stocks will benefit.\n\nMeta and Microsoft will dominate the after-the-bell reports, and while Cramer said he believes Meta can continue its phenomenal quarterly run, he isn’t too sure whether Microsoft will be able to convince investors that its AI-tool Copilot is as strong as advertised. Two more companies Cramer said will likely show a hot quarter, Booking Holding\nand DoorDash\n, will shed more light on consumers prior to the nonfarm payroll report.', 'The monster week for earnings will continue into Thursday, as both Apple and Amazon will report after the bell. Even after the lackluster iPhone 16 launch, Cramer said ″we’ve seen this movie before″ with the company and the best strategy is to hold on.\n\nAnother moment not to panic, he said Amazon is doing well and not to dogpile on the potential hammering the stock received last quarter. Cramer said he believes two drug stocks, Merck\nand Bristol-Myers\n, are too low, but if Friday brings a weak employment number then they are two stocks investors should not have bought.', 'On Friday, the nonfarm payroll report will be released, and Cramer said he “can’t stress how important this number is.” He said continued strong employment will mean no November interest rate cut, and even though some investors will want to sell, fed rate cut cycles are times to buy. Oil titans Chevron and Exxon will report the same day.\n\nCramer said he was impressed on his trip by the way Chevron’s returned a huge amount of capital in dividends and buybacks even though it is still the worst performer in the group. He also said Exxon is more loved than Chevron from the battle over the Hess acquisition, even as Exxon doesn’t have as much earnings power, and suggested people should switch sides.', 'Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.', 'Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer’s every move in the market.', 'Disclaimer', 'Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC', 'Want to take a deep dive into Cramer’s world?

Google-parent Alphabet kicks things off Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday. The grand finale comes on Halloween day, when Apple and Amazon report third-quarter results. Nvidia, meanwhile, reports closer to Thanksgiving, on November 20.', '“Tech companies have been spending billions on AI like kids in a candy store,” said David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial. “Now investors want to see what they’re getting for their money.”', 'Earnings season for tech got off to a strong start Wednesday evening when Tesla surprised Wall Street with better-than-expected earnings. The electric vehicle maker managed to boost profits by slashing the cost to build each car by $2,400 compared to last year, even as it wages a price war with competitors. The results sent Tesla’s shares surging more than 11% in after-hours trading, potentially setting a positive tone for next week’s parade of tech earnings.', 'But the stakes remain huge for the rest of the so-called magnificent seven companies. Nvidia, the company making chips powering the AI boom, is now worth more than the entire stock markets of Canada and France.', 'The pressure may be strongest on Google and Microsoft, two companies locked in battle for AI supremacy. Google will need to prove that its AI tools are attracting paying business customers, while Microsoft is aiming to show that its multibillion-dollar partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is generating real revenue.', 'Meta, meanwhile, is betting that AI can add some fuel to its floundering advertising business, and Amazon is looking to convince investors that AI is driving growth in the cloud.', 'But there’s more spooking Wall Street than just tech earnings. Markets are growing increasingly nervous about next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, where officials will signal if more interest rate hikes are coming. Add to that a presidential election that’s looking increasingly close as well as growing geopolitical tensions, investors have plenty of reasons for concern.', '“Maybe the long-awaited close election sell-off is arriving, albeit after six successive weeks of rallying,” wrote Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid in a note last week.', 'For average investors, the next few weeks could determine whether their tech-heavy portfolios thrive or flounder.', '“We believe tech stocks could jump another 20% higher in 2025 if companies show AI is actually making them money,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.', 'By Halloween night, as trick-or-treaters make their rounds, investors will have a better idea of whether Big Tech’s massive AI bet is finally starting to pay off, or if the promise of artificial intelligence turns out to be more trick than treat.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Net income increased by 10% to $22 billion, and diluted EPS rose by 10% to $2.69. Strong growth in segments like Intelligent Cloud, up 19%, and Dynamics products and services, up 16%, contributed to this.', 'The weekly chart for Google reveals a solid bullish price action characterized by an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. The head of this pattern formed in the first quarter of 2024, supported by a black trend line. This trend line extends from a wedge pattern established in 2018 and 2019. This head is also marked by the triple bottom on the weekly chart, indicating long-term support.', 'These historical bullish price patterns indicate a long-term bullish potential for Google. Recently, the price has been testing the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern ahead of the Q3 2024 earnings release. The earnings release may induce significant volatility, which may push the prices higher.', '', '', 'The daily chart shows the formation of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern with the neckline at $169.

Additionally, the RSI is holding at the mid-level, further supporting positive momentum for Google.', '', '', 'The weekly chart for Meta shows positive momentum with a double bottom formation within a symmetrical broadening wedge pattern.

The price has been moving within this pattern for the past six years, indicating strong volatility. The emergence of a symmetrical broadening wedge within this pattern suggests a further increase in volatility. Additionally, the RSI is bottoming at the mid-level, indicating positive momentum in price.', '', '', 'The symmetrical broadening wedge pattern is also visible on the daily chart. This pattern suggests that if the price begins to move upward, the target remains around the $510 level.

"The Week Ahead: US PCE inflation, jobs report; Microsoft, Amazon results",https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-au/market-news/the-week-ahead-us-pce-inflation-jobs-report-microsoft-amazon-results,"['Welcome to Michael Kramer’s pick of the top market events to look out for in the week ahead, plus his latest US election betting market update. ', 'The coming week will be one of the busiest of the quarter, teeming with company earnings reports and economic announcements – particularly from the US. Big Tech will be the focus, with quarterly results from Google parent company Alphabet (Q3), Facebook owner Meta Platforms (Q3), Microsoft (Q1), Amazon (Q3) and Apple (Q4) likely to move US markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Investors will be paying close attention to what the tech giants say about their AI spending plans and where they see the benefits. Traders will also be keeping an eye on US inflation and labour market data, the last round of such figures before the US election on 5 November and the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting meeting from 6-7 November. In the interests of full disclosure, please note that Michael Kramer and the clients of his company Mott Capital Management own shares of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Class A) and Microsoft. ', 'Former president Donald Trump’s lead over vice-president Kamala Harris in a key betting market widened over the past week. Data from the US betting site PredictIt indicates that 58% of those betting on Trump back him to win and 42% bet he’ll lose. Among those betting on Harris, 48% back her to win and 52% bet she’ll lose. ', 'At this stage, the betting markets have Trump as the likely winner, but it’s possible that a small number of large stakes are skewing the data in his favour, perhaps in a bid by deep-pocketed Trump supporters to shape voter perceptions of his campaign momentum. It’s also possible that some sampling bias may be at play, as Trump supporters may be on the whole more likely to place bets than Harris supporters. In any case, whether the wisdom of the crowd will prove correct remains uncertain, since – as with any other market – nothing is guaranteed.', 'Trump is ahead of Harris in the US betting market', 'Sources: PredictIt, Bloomberg, Michael Kramer', 'Wednesday 30 October\nMicrosoft is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings of $3.11 a share, representing annual growth of 3.9%, on revenue of $64.5bn, up 14.2% from the year-ago period. However, the focus will be on revenue from the company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which is expected to have grown 12.6% to $27.3bn. Within that unit, cloud computing platform Azure is forecast to have grown 30.2% on a constant currency basis, with AI contributing 9.25%. Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to be around $14.5bn. ', 'Looking ahead to the next quarter, analysts expect earnings to rise to $3.25 a share on revenue of $69.8bn. Meanwhile, the Intelligent Cloud unit is projected to generate $29.3bn in revenue, with Azure growth of 29.7% and AI contributing 9.9%. Capex is expected to remain flat at approximately $14.4bn. ', 'Following the Q1 results announcement, Microsoft shares – which closed at $424.73 on Thursday, up 14.5% year-to-date – could move 3.9%, either up or down, based on current options market pricing.', 'From a technical perspective, Microsoft’s share price has entered a somewhat negative phase. The chart below shows a rising megaphone pattern, which typically indicates a potential reversal to the downside. Momentum, as measured by the relative strength index (RSI), has been bearish for some time. Moving forward, the most likely outcome for the stock may be a break below the lower trendline of the megaphone pattern, potentially down towards support around $370. Upside potential appears more limited, with resistance around $440.', 'Microsoft share price, July 2023 - present', 'Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer', 'Thursday 31 October\nFor the third quarter, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.15 a share, up 22.7% versus the year-ago period, on revenue of $157.3bn, an increase of 10% year-on-year. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is estimated to have grown 19.1% to $27.4bn while operating income is expected to climb to $14.7bn. ', 'For the fourth quarter, analysts project revenue to rise to $186.4bn, with operating income reaching $17.8bn. AWS revenue growth is forecast to accelerate slightly to 19.2%. ', 'Following the Q3 results, the market is pricing in a share price move of 6.9%, either up or down. Amazon stock closed at $186.38 on Thursday, up 24.3% this year. ', ""Amazon's technical chart, below, resembles that of Microsoft, with a decline in July followed by a rebound in August and September. Now, though, Amazon seems to be forming more of a traditional bear flag pattern. The stock may have already broken below its uptrend, signalling further downside potential. The first support level to watch is near $180, with a second support level at around $171. Upside potential appears somewhat limited, with resistance at $190 and $195. "", 'Amazon share price, November 2023 - present', 'Sources: TradingView, Michael Kramer', 'Thursday 31 October\nThe US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, said to be the Fed’s favourite inflation gauge, is expected to have risen 2.1% in the year to September, based on analyst estimates, easing from 2.2% in August. Estimates also point to an increase of 0.2% on a monthly basis. The closely watched core PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have increased 2.6% year-on-year, cooling from 2.7% in August, while rising 0.3% month-on-month.', 'The latest inflation data could have a bearing on the Fed’s upcoming interest rate decision, and may also play on the minds of voters in the US presidential election, with early in-person voting already underway. ', 'Friday 1 November\nAnalysts estimate that the US economy added 135,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate is predicted to have remained unchanged at 4.1%. Monthly growth in pay is anticipated to have slowed to 0.3% from 0.4%, maintaining a year-on-year growth rate of 4%. A weaker-than-expected payrolls number, or a noticeable rise in unemployment, could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates by 50 basis points, whereas a stronger report may result in no cut at all. The most likely move is a 25-basis-point cut, according to 95% of interest rate traders surveyed by CME FedWatch.  ', ""Implied volatility is likely to surge ahead of the jobs report, especially with the US election and the Fed meeting just around the corner. It's become common for the VIX 1-day to spike to around 20 points before the non-farm payrolls (NFP) report, as the below chart shows. This time should be no different, suggesting that options premiums may become expensive. But then, as implied volatility drops following the release of the non-farm payrolls print, put premiums may decrease, potentially sparking an initial rally for US equity markets such as the S&P 500.
