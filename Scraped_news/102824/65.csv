That means there will likely be more opportunities for people to see the northern lights in the near future.', 'Noble advised people to keep a few things in mind when looking for a good view.', '""Get out of the cities, have a good view of the northern horizon and check the weather forecast,"" Noble said.', ""If it is cloudy, the northern lights may be less visible. Smoky areas can have the same issue. Weaker northern light events may not be visible if your view is blocked by mountains, although this isn't necessarily true for stronger events that occur overhead."", 'While it can depend on individual events, the northern lights are generally at peak visibility from midnight until one in the morning.', 'The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has an aurora dashboard, which gives people the chance to tell the likelihood of northern lights visibility ahead of time.

This interaction has as a result the atoms in our planet’s atmosphere to glow, developing a spectrum of colour in the sky of the night.', '“As being part of the interaction, lights gets the chance to be released, and that is what is able to see as this shimmering radiance of the aurora”, Dahl told.', 'The sun’s magnetic field gets it solar maximum, one every eleven year, during which time the quantity of solar flares is at it’s maximum, according to NOAA. Nodaway’s solar cycle is expected to reach its peak withing November 2024 and March 2026, NOAA says, in the course of which time lights activity will be increased.', 'If we are in the continent US, the places that are best known for seeing the northern lights include the upper Midwest, including upper Michigan peninsula and North Dakota, Dahl explained.', '“That is where the area of the country is better to a more southward aurora’s progress”, he said.', 'Expedia Group, the travel company, clarified that April, October and November are the best months to go in order to see the northern lights in Michigan. The Voyageurs National Park close to the Canadian border, in Minnesota,  during the fall or winter months are the more appropriate seasons to chase auroras, according to Expedia.', 'Expedia also says that Alaska, Canada, Finland and Norway are the best spots to the northern light.', 'Occasionally the lights can be extended farther south than ordinary. When the geomagnetic storm is strong, the south is father from the northern light are able to be seen, Macdonald said.', '“This is the first time they are noticeable in more places than before”, Melanie Fish, an expert in travelling at Expedia Group, reported to ABC News.', 'Nevertheless, when your position is closer to the south, the lights that gets more red will show rather than as the known green curtains, according to the Nation Park Service. This is due to the curvature of the Earth produced that particles to interact way more high in the atmosphere, in the zone where the oxygen isn’t plentiful, resulting in a kind of red hue.', 'One of the top spots to see the northern light is The Great Wall of Chine, according to Expedia.', 'Having ensured a dark setting is the greatest way to see the aurora, the experts explained that the best time to see the northern lights is usually two hours before and after midnight, according to Dahl. Also, during the winter months, that window can be increased to four hours before and after midnight, as the skies get dark on earlier time.', 'The fact of getting away from the pollution that come from the light, even a bright light o a full moon, will make the experience better, Dahl said.', 'As a reminder, Dahn told to keep the vision adapted to the dark and don’t get in contact with the bright screen of any phone.', 'Space weather prediction is a very complex area of investigation, this is because the sun is around 93 million miles away, MacDonald said. In addition, that huge distance makes it hard to predict the intensity of CMEs.', 'The experts and scientists are still investigating the composition of CME, or the strength of its magnetic field, until it’s about one million miles away from Earth, in which a spacecraft stationed could take measurements, Dahl explained. At this stage, the CME is on Earth’s limit.', '“This fact provides us some hours of warning of how capable and how much that activity coming from the sun is coming into Earth’s magnetic field region out in space, and the drive that the aurora will take”, Macdonald said.', 'Beyond complicating the capacity to forecast the energy of a CME is the option that it could be affect by substorm on its long way toward Earth, Dahl said.', 'Macdonald is running a platform  dedicated to citizen science named Aurorasaurus that permits people to sing up for alerts in the case of having a visible aurora could  in their area.', 'Reporting back to the website about whether they saw an aurora is the user’s function.

This increased activity allows for more Coronal Mass Ejections leaving the sun and entering Earth’s atmosphere.', 'Executive Director for the Kopernik Observatory Drew Deskur said that even with this increased activity, the energy has to hit Earth, not just at the right time, but at the right angle as well.', 'When it comes to seeing the lights, Deskur said that the KP Index, or the tool used to measure how strong a geomagnetic storm is, should be on the higher side.', '“A KP Index of at least six, seven or eight is much better. The KP Index is basically an indication of how strong that solar storm is,” He said.', 'While there is no guarantee of seeing a strong storm again this year, if the region does happen to have a chance to see the lights, Deskur recommended finding somewhere away from light pollution.', '“You want to get yourself in as dark of a spot as possible,” said Deskur. “Somewhere that doesn’t have a whole lot of street lights, ideally being able to look to the north, northeast or northwest, and just be willing to wait deeper into the evening where it tends to be darker.”', 'Deskur added that even if the KP Index is low, there is still a chance of seeing the lights, but it would only be seen using high-exposure photography.', '', 'Copyright 2024 WBNG.

It made me happy to see that other people wanted to see the lights as well. They weren't that visible to the naked eye yet, but with my phone’s camera, I was able to capture some cool photos of the lights. At first, they appeared really faint: the colors were visible in the photos, but it wasn’t absolutely breathtaking—not yet, anyway. Still, I was in awe. I missed the Northern Lights display in May, so I was ecstatic that I finally caught it this time. "", ""Eventually, the night got colder, so cold that I had to wear gloves. After a solid two hours of staring at the sky and admiring the colors I captured with my phone, I decided to head back because the cold had eventually become too much to bear. As I was walking the long trail down the hill, I heard some commotion. I turned around to look up at the sky, and I was amazed by what I saw. Suddenly, the northern lights were visible to the naked eye. Green and pink hues illuminated the sky, creating an incredible view. It was insanely magical, and the photos I captured during this moment were even more amazing. The lights were super radiant and colorful, and I'm glad I have photos that I can always refer to. "", 'Overall, despite the extremely cold weather, I had an incredible night. It’s moments like these that remind me to appreciate nature’s beauty. It may be easy to take for granted, but there’s a lot of positive aspects in life: you just have to acknowledge them. If you saw the lights, I hope that it was as magical for you as it was for me.

The Northern Lights,https://www.discover-the-world.com/northern-lights/,"['', 'The northern lights are also known as the aurora borealis, meaning light of dawn. It’s said the term was first coined by Galileo in 1623 and is derived from ‘Aurora’, the goddess of the dawn and ‘Boreas’, the northern wind personified.', 'The northern lights and their counterpart in the southern hemisphere appear when highly charged solar wind particles flowing from the sun collide with air molecules in the earth’s atmosphere transferring their energy into light. This occurs around the Polar Regions where those magnetic fields converge. These magnetic fields create auroral ovals around the top and bottom of our planet which move and distort as the earth rotates and solar flare activity increases.', 'They usually occur between 60 and 75 degrees of latitude, which covers northern parts of Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Alaska and Russia as well as all of Iceland.', 'Interestingly, the northern and southern lights, or aurora australis, occur simultaneously but the inverse seasons mean they generally aren’t visible at the same time.', 'The aurora borealis are potentially visible under dark skies from late August to mid-April preferably under a clear, cloudless sky. While they occur year round they are weaker than sunlight and therefore sightings aren’t possible from May to July and for most of August.', 'Due to the axial tilt, as the earth moves around the sun the angle of our magnetic fields relative to the magnetic field of the solar wind change. During optimum configuration, which occurs during the equinoxes, “magnetic cracks” open up that let solar particles in setting off an auroral storm cycle, which in turn creates a higher probability of northern lights.', 'In our 40 years experience of arranging holidays to see the northern lights we’ve discovered the best places to view this incredible phenomenon.', 'The northern lights most commonly occur within the geographic area beneath the auroral oval. It encompasses latitudes between 60 and 75 degrees and takes in Iceland, northern parts of Sweden, Finland, Norway, Russia, Canada and Alaska as well as southern Greenland.', 'The map graphic shown here is indicative of where the aurora are most visible, but they can appear at lower latitudes. Particularly strong solar storms can result in the lights being seen in Scotland and northern England and even further south, though most aurora activity occurs within the oval hence its designation.', 'However, aurora activity is not consistent and the auroral oval – the appearance of light as a ring around the poles – constantly shifts. Therefore strong aurora in Sweden do not necessarily mean strong aurora in Canada and vice versa. The oval is tracked by space weather stations and is shown in forecast modules (see the ovation map below).', 'Northern Scandinavia and Iceland offer the most accessible destinations from the UK for viewing the northern lights, but there are recognised locations throughout the zone that offer optimum conditions for sightings. It is important to be away from any sources of artificial light, such as street lighting, whereas you do want to be near open spaces offering big sky viewing.', 'Aurora forecasts are given for a 3-day period and are constantly updated. Longer term forecasts based on the 27-day solar cycle can be useful, but as with long term weather forecasts, they can change.', 'Recommended websites:', 'Follow us on Facebook for alerts when strong aurora are predicted.', '', 'The sun is essentially a huge ball of self-luminous plasma which rotates every 27 days or so and surrounding the sun is a million-degree-hot atmosphere called corona. Sometimes there are large openings where the sun’s magnetic field stretches into space and these corona holes are the key to the northern lights.', 'Fast moving solar wind flows from these coronal holes, consisting of a stream of charged particles, which typically take 2-3 days to reach the earth – though this can be much faster following powerful solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CME). The charged particles then collide with the earth’s magnetic field and accelerate down the magnetic lines towards the poles. Most are diverted and disappear into space, but the fast ones enter the earth’s upper atmosphere, where the magnetic fields converge. This is where the reaction of the particles and gases happen – atoms and molecules of oxygen and nitrogen get excited and release the light we know as the northern lights. Indeed, the event occurs simultaneously in the southern hemisphere causing the southern lights (aurora australis) to appear with one mirroring the other.', '', '', '', '', '', 'The colour of the aurora depends on which chemicals are present and the altitude of the meeting of atoms and particles.
