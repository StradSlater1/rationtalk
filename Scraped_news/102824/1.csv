"Trump loyalists spew racist, vulgar attacks at Harris and Democrats at New York City rally",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/27/politics/trump-rally-madison-square-garden-vulgar-attacks/index.html,"['', 'Former President Donald Trump closed his Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday with an ominous 80-minute speech denouncing his political rivals, assailing immigrants and promising to invoke an 18th century law to pave the way for mass deportations.', 'But it was the opening acts of the New York City rally – a hodgepodge of donors, entertainers and MAGA politicians – who unleashed an eleventh-hour campaign furor that prompted angry rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans who worried the vengeful show would hurt their standing with moderate voters.', 'RELATED LIVE-STORY\nThe latest on the 2024 presidential election', 'Local Trump loyalists, who made up many of the speakers’ list ahead of the former president, took the opportunity to spew familiar grievances at some of Trump’s favorite targets. One failed Republican House candidate labeled Harris “the antichrist.”', 'He hardly stood out.', 'The rally began with Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, assailing Puerto Rico – in the city that’s home to the largest Puerto Rican population on the US mainland. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans also live in battleground Pennsylvania, where Harris campaigned on Sunday.', '“There’s a lot going on, like, I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,” he said. “I think it’s called Puerto Rico.”', 'The line was well-received by Trump supporters who filled the historic arena in Midtown Manhattan. Trump has recently taken to calling the US “a garbage can for the world” when he rails against undocumented immigrants.', '“These Latinos, they love making babies, too. Just know that they do,” Hinchcliffe continued.', 'After the rally, Trump’s campaign sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, who like the other speakers was an invited guest, and his comments about Puerto Rico.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nBad Bunny shows support for Harris after comedian makes offensive comment about Puerto Rico at Trump rally', '“This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to CNN.', 'But Harris’ campaign had already seized on the comments about Puerto Rico, quickly clipping the video and posting it on social media channels. The vice president on Sunday visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia, where she discussed her vision for the island along with plans to lower costs and create opportunity in Puerto Rican communities on the mainland.', 'Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whose album “Un Verano Sin Ti” was the most-streamed album globally in 2023, posted a video of Harris spelling out her plan for Puerto Rico to his 45 million Instagram followers shortly after Hinchcliffe left the stage.', 'Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, whose reelection campaign depends on sizable support from the state’s Puerto Rican community, joined the backlash, writing of the “joke” on X, “It’s not funny and it’s not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!”', 'Another Florida Republican, Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a close ally of Trump’s, blasted the remarks. “This is not a joke. It’s completely classless & in poor taste,” he said on X. “@TonyHinchcliffe clearly isn’t funny & definitely doesn’t reflect my values or those of the Republican Party.”', 'New York GOP Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, who’s facing a competitive reelection, also responded on X by saying, “I’m proud to be Puerto Rican,” adding, “The only thing that’s ‘garbage’ was a bad comedy set. Stay on message.”', 'Hinchcliffe, also on social media, addressed the furor, saying that his critics “have no sense of humor.”', '“I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone … watch the whole set,” he wrote.', 'Trump — who was introduced by former first lady Melania Trump in her first speaking role at a rally this cycle — largely stuck to the script in his own remarks, including his now common assertion that his political rivals represent a traitorous “enemy within.”', '“We’re running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine that’s running the Democrat party,” the former president said. “They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.”', 'Another warm-up act, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, reprised his old attacks on Harris and the idea, as he described it, of Americans celebrating her possible election.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nFact check: Trump repeats numerous false claims at Madison Square Garden rally', '“It’s gonna be pretty hard to look at (the country after Harris wins) and say, you know what, Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s so impressive – as the first Samoan, Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president,” said Carlson, before exclaiming that anyone who is not impressed by Harris will be called a “freak” or a “criminal.”', 'Later, Republican politician David Rem took the microphone to call Harris “the devil” while waving around a cross.', '“She is the antichrist,” Rem wailed, before saying he planned to run for mayor.', 'Another speaker, radio host Sid Rosenberg — who once occupied a plum seat beside Don Imus on WFAN, the area’s largest sports station — started off by attacking Clinton, the Democratic nominee from eight years ago.', '“She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh?,” he said, channeling Trump’s own past remarks. “What a sick son of a b*tch.”', 'Rosenberg then turned his attention to migrants now living in New York City – and his fury over the local government’s attempts to feed and house them.', '“You got homeless and veterans – Americans, Americans – sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park,” Rosenberg said. “But the f**king illegals, they get whatever they want, don’t they?”', 'This story has been updated with more from the rally.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Trump's Madison Square Garden event features crude and racist insults,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-veers-away-swing-states-040221461.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump hosted a rally featuring crude and racist insults at New York’s Madison Square Garden Sunday, turning what his campaign had dubbed as the event where he would deliver his closing message into an illustration of what turns off his critics.', 'With just over a week before Election Day, speakers labeled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” called Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris “the devil,” and said the woman vying to become the first woman and Black woman president had begun her career as a prostitute.', '“I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” said Tony Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic whose set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election just nine days away.', ""His joke was immediately criticized by Harris’ campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states. Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe's appearance."", 'The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,"" senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.', 'But other speakers also made incendiary comments. Trump’s childhood friend David Rem referred to Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil.” Businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris ”and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.”', ""The marquee event reflected the former president's tone throughout his third White House campaign. Though he refrained from doing so Sunday, Trump often tears into Harris in offensive and personal terms himself, questioning in recent weeks her mental stability and her intelligence as well as calling her “lazy,” long a racist trope used against Black people."", 'The event was a surreal spectacle that included former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, politicians including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik, and an artist who painted a picture of Trump hugging the Empire State Building.', 'And that was all before Trump was to take the stage, running more than two hours late.', 'After being introduced by his wife, Melania Trump, in a rare public appearance, the former president began by asking the same questions he’s asked at the start of every recent rally: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” The crowd responded with a resounding “No!”', '“This election is a choice between whether we’ll have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we’ll begin the greatest years in the history of our country,” he said.', 'Trump announced a new tax credit for caregivers', 'Trump on Sunday added a new proposal to his list of tax cuts aimed at winning over older adults and blue-collar workers, which already includes vows to end taxes on Social Security benefits, tips and overtime pay: A tax credit for family caregivers.', 'This comes after Harris has talked about the “sandwich generation” of adults caring for aging parents while raising their children at the same time. Harris has proposed federal funding to cover home care costs for older Americans.', 'Trump otherwise repeated familiar lines about foreign policy and immigration, calling for the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen and saying that the day he takes office, “The migrant invasion of our country ends.”', 'As Trump’s remarks came up on an hour, some of the crowd began trickling out.', 'Tech mogul Elon Musk, who spoke earlier and introduced Melania Trump, was a prominent part of Trump’s closing campaign message. The former president called Musk “a genius” and “special.”', ""Musk nodded to Trump's recent plan to allow him to lead a government efficiency commission to audit the entire federal government. Several of Musk's businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX, have major government contracts or have relied on U.S. subsidies, and Musk has faced criticism after reports that he has spoken privately with Russian President Vladimir Putin."", '“Your money is being wasted and the department of government efficiency is going to fix that,"" Musk said before taking a place offstage beside Melania Trump.', 'Many of the speakers Sunday appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention. This time, the same speakers shouted and railed more against Democrats.', 'Hogan, returning to the venue where he performed years ago as a professional wrestler, seemed to reprise his character, emerging wearing a giant red, orange and yellow boa and violently waving a large American flag as he posed and danced. He spat on the stage during his speech, flexed his muscles repeatedly and told the audience: “Trump is the only man that can fix this country today.”', 'Trump allies went after Democrats for bringing up a pro-Nazi rally', 'Some Democrats, calling Trump a fascist, have compared his Sunday event to a pro-Nazi rally at the Garden in February 1939. Several speakers on Sunday ripped Hillary Clinton, the Democrat defeated by Trump eight years ago, for saying recently that Trump would be “reenacting” the 1939 event. One of them, radio host Sid Rosenberg, directed a profanity at Clinton.', '“Hey guys, they’re now scrambling and trying to call us Nazis and fascists,” said Alina Habba, one of Trump’s attorneys, who draped a sparkly “MAGA” jacket over the lectern as she spoke. “And you know what they’re claiming, guys? It’s very scary. They’re claiming we’re going to go after them and try and put them in jail. Well, ain’t that rich?”', ""Declared Hogan in his raspy growl: “I don't see no stinkin' Nazis in here.”"", 'Trump has denounced the four criminal indictments brought against him as politically motivated. He has ramped up his denunciations in recent weeks of “enemies from within,” naming domestic political rivals, and suggested he would use the military to go after them. Harris, in turn, has referred to Trump as a fascist.', 'The arena was full hours before Trump was scheduled to speak. Outside the arena, the sidewalks were overflowing with Trump supporters in red “Make America Great Again” hats. There was a heavy security presence. Streets were blocked off and access to Penn Station was restricted.', '“It just goes to show ya that he has a bigger following of any man that has ever lived,” said Philip D’Agostino, a longtime Trump backer from Queens, the borough where Trump grew up.', 'A New Yorker returns home', 'Trump has a complicated history with the place where he built his business empire and that made him a tabloid and reality TV star. Its residents indicted him last year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He was found guilty in that case, and also found liable in civil court for business fraud and sexual abuse.', 'But Trump has been talking about wanting to hold a rally at the venue dubbed “The World’s Most Famous Arena” since he launched his campaign.', 'The rally was one of a number of detours Trump has made from battleground states, including a recent rally in Coachella, California, and rallies on the Jersey Shore and in the South Bronx.', 'While some have dismissed the stops as nothing more than vanity events aimed at boosting Trump’s ego, the rallies guaranteed Trump national coverage that could help him reach the country’s few remaining undecided voters, many of whom don’t get their news from traditional outlets.', ""New York has not voted for a Republican for president in 40 years. But that hasn't stopped Trump from continuing to insist he believes he can win. New York is also home to a handful of competitive congressional races that could determine which party controls the House next year."", 'Trump routinely uses his hometown as a foil before audiences in other states, painting a dark vision of the city that bears little resemblance to reality. He’s cast it as crime-ridden and overrun by violent, immigrant gangs who have taken over Fifth and Madison avenues and occupied Times Square.', 'On Sunday, however, Trump was much more complimentary of the city.

She was in charge of the border.” Harris was never “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate, and she was never in charge of border security, a responsibility of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. In reality, President Joe Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.', 'Trump’s rally crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania: The former president repeated his wild exaggeration that there were “101,000 people” at the campaign rally he held earlier this month at the same Pennsylvania site where a gunman tried to kill him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh reported that the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott, said in his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at “21,000-plus people.”', 'Former President Donald Trump during his speech Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York hit Vice President Kamala Harris over the economy and announced a new policy that would provide tax credits for caregiving family members.', '“I am here today with the message of hope for all Americans: With your vote in this election, I will end inflation.

She had been making more public statements in recent weeks as she promoted her memoir, which published this month.', 'This post has been updated with Melania Trump’s remarks.', 'Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz criticized a speaker at Donald Trump’s Sunday rally in New York who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” by attacking the former president’s handling of the response to Hurricane Maria after it hit the island in 2017.', 'Walz joined a livestreamed conversation with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Twitch, where they watched and reacted to clips of recent events, including the comment at Sunday’s Trump rally from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe.

Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone … watch the whole set.”', 'Walz and Ocasio-Cortez reacted to the clip as part of a conversation that partially included the two of them playing video games and answering questions from people in the streaming platform’s comments.', 'The Democratic National Committee projected several messages onto Madison Square Garden in New York City criticizing Donald Trump ahead of the former president’s remarks there Sunday night.', 'The messages, which went up shortly after 6 p.m., included: “Trump praised Hitler” “Trump=Unwell” “Trump=cheat” “Trump=convict” and “Trump=Unhinged”', '“Donald Trump has grown increasingly unhinged in the final weeks heading into Election Day; so much so that those who know Trump best are warning voters that he is dangerously unfit to lead,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement.', 'The event in Trump’s hometown included speeches from House Speaker Mike Johnson, billionaire Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former first lady Melania Trump.', 'Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani received a standing ovation at Donald Trump’s rally in the city Sunday — days after being ordered by a federal judge to turn over his valuable possessions and his Manhattan penthouse to the Georgia election workers he defamed.', 'During his speech at Madison Square Garden, Giuliani railed against Trump’s four indictments and said, “If they indicted him one more time he would’ve been elected by acclimation.”', 'The former Trump lawyer added: “Every American should take an oath to make this country better than it was handed to him or her. If I died now, I would break that oath because America is not better today than it was when it was handed to me or than it was four years ago. But in a few weeks, we get a chance to change that.”', '', 'Giuliani has a court hearing Monday regarding whether he also needs to turn over his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida, or the four New York Yankees World Series rings he has.

That is about to happen on November 5. New York is going to make that happen.

Democrats need to net just four seats to flip the House, and there were four House races in the Empire State that the GOP won by under 5 points in 2022, all in districts that Biden would have won in 2020 under current lines.', 'New York GOP Reps.
