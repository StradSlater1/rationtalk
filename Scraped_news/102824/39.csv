‘Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’ ending explained,https://www.nme.com/guides/gaming-guides/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ending-explained-3806535,"['More to tell', 'The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign has been out for a few days now, and the game’s ending has confused some and left many scratching their heads as to what it all means. Thankfully, we have some clues to unravel the mystery, although there are still a lot of questions.', 'Below, you can find a breakdown and overview of the game’s ending cutscene, and an idea as to who that mystery character is.', 'The ending of the game sees the characters reunite together after the events of the game and meet with Livingstone who says Pantheon members are still within the CIA and he wants everyone to continue working on it. At the same time, it is revealed that someone is hacking into Livingstone’s computer. We don’t know who this is, but two suggestions are either Case (your character) or Jackson Caine, the leader of Crimson One.', '', '', 'As you never see Case, it is hard to know if this character is him, but this same character does appear in the interogation scene at the beginning of the campaign, and Case was on the mission they are talking about. If this is Jackson Caine, then we could be setting up the story for the multiplayer seasons.', 'However, suggestions towards this being Case are warranted. The freakout Case had on the helicopter at the end is because they were the original subject of The Cradle biological weapon tests ten years ago, still suffering from the effects of it, which they saw during the Emergence mission. They appear to kill Jane Harrow in that crash, although it isn’t clear.', 'But, The Cradle biological weapon they break in the helicopter makes Case lose it and potentially switch into the ultimate evil super soldier the program was designed to achieve, explaining why they are not with the crew in that final scene. This was highlighted by ‘Inkslasher’ on YouTube.', '', 'Coincidentally, ten years ago, the campaign of Black Ops Cold War took place in 1981. This campaign ended with your character (Bell) being shot by Adler. But what if Bell didn’t die and instead was taken and experimented on as a part of The Cradle program and becoming Case? This would potentially explain why Adler was familiar with The Cradle before.', 'Either way, that is just a guess, but our best guess right now. We should hopefully find out more as the game is supported over the next year, potentially even with more story teasers if this turns out to be Jackson Caine, who appears as an Operator in multiplayer.', ' ', 'For even more campaign guides, check out our breakdown on all the safe code locations in the game, as well as where you can find Cash easily to purchase upgrades.', 'The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.', 'When you purchase through affiliate links on NME.com, you may contribute to our site through commissions.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 could boost Game Pass subscribers by 2.5m to 4m,https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m,"['Analysts give their predictions on the impact of the new Call of Duty into Xbox’s subscription service', ""The launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 into Game Pass will hurt sales of the game, but will see millions of subscribers flock to Xbox's service, leading analysts say."", ""However, the true success won't be immediately known, as it'll depend on whether Xbox can keep subscribers within the service in the months following the game's launch."", 'Wedbush boss Michael Pachter believes that putting Call of Duty in Game Pass could result in up to six million lost sales, based on the idea that 25% of Game Pass subscribers may have bought the game anyway. However, he adds that the move could result in between three to four million people signing up to Game Pass to access the title.', '""Good overall for Microsoft and for consumers,"" he told us. ""But the headline will say \'Call of Duty sales are down\'.""', 'Who will buy COD?', ""We conducted a survey with our friends at IGN. Based on readers of the IGN homepage, and looking purely at those intending to acquire Black Ops 6, 70% of readers who plan to get the game say they're already subscribers to Game Pass and will acquire it that way."", 'Meanwhile, nearly 8% said they plan to get Game Pass in order to play the next Call of Duty.', ""In terms of IGN's YouTube Audience, 63% of those who plan to play Black Ops 6 are already Game Pass subscribers, with again nearly 8% planning to get Game Pass to experience the title (the remaining respondents will get the game 'the old fashioned way')."", ""IGN's audience is a specific one and not reflective of all gamer audiences, but it's clear Game Pass will be a popular place to experience this year's release."", ""Ampere's chief games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls is a little more conservative, and believes that Call of Duty will result in a 10% increase in Game Pass Ultimate subscribers (so 2.5 million). He also says that not all of those will be completely new users, as it will include those upgrading from Game Pass Core and Game Pass Standard (Call of Duty will only be available in the 'Ultimate' tier). In fact, he feels a 'good chunk' of new subscribers will come from those tiers."", 'Harding-Rolls adds that although there will inevitably be some lost premium sales, there is scope to alleviate that through other forms of monetisation.', '""The removal of the 14-day $1 trial offer is an indication that Microsoft needs to maximise its subscription revenue returns from the introduction of one of gaming\'s biggest franchises at launch,"" he says.', '""There is no doubt that adding the latest Call of Duty will be expensive, at least initially, for Microsoft. However, Call of Duty is increasingly a live-service game first and foremost that monetises strongly in-game. Microsoft will be trading premium full-game sales in exchange for a bigger audience that can be monetised in-game instead.', '""One of the key questions is how this might impact how the game is monetised and whether there is a bigger onus on in-game monetisation compared to previous entries in the franchise. In terms of audience expansion, Xbox and PC are likely to be key growth platforms. Cloud support at launch offers some potential, but I think the Call of Duty streaming opportunity aligns most strongly with playing on TV screens and PC monitors rather than on mobile devices where Call of Duty Mobile and Warzone are already popular.""', ""Newzoo market analyst Brett Hunt also believes that Black Ops 6 will attract a stronger audience this year, certainly compared with last year's Modern Warfare 3. However, that's not just because of its inclusion in Game Pass."", '""Black Ops has always been well received and with a mutually exclusive campaign from Modern Warfare, new movement system in multiplayer, and return of round-based Zombies, this should result in numbers much closer to those of Modern Warfare 2 than 3. This is the most Call of Duty has been reinvigorated in recent years, and the numbers will likely reflect this.""', 'Newzoo says that Modern Warfare 2 attracted 21.7 million monthly active users in the US, compared with just 12 million for Modern Warfare 3.', 'One key discussion point is around the impact Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will have on PlayStation. For the past generation, Sony has had a content and marketing exclusivity agreement with Activision over Call of Duty, which has now ended. Game Pass is also unavailable on PlayStation 5. So could this result in some audience shift from PlayStation towards Xbox?', '""Those who own both Xbox and PlayStation consoles may be swayed to play the game on Microsoft\'s devices, but cross-platform play and multi-platform accounts mean this is not necessarily a permanent decision,” explains Harding-Rolls.', '""Indeed, there could be a scenario where PlayStation-first multi-console gamers switch to Xbox to play the premium campaign while still playing F2P Warzone on their preferred console under a single Activision account. As such, I\'m not convinced that the longer-term audience on PlayStation will be significantly disrupted, although Sony will potentially have its storefront share of premium sales undermined to an extent.""', '""I\'m not convinced that the longer-term audience on PlayStation will be significantly disrupted, although Sony will potentially have its storefront share of premium sales undermined to an extent""', ""All the analysts we spoke to agreed on one thing, and that's the success of this move will depend on whether Xbox can retain the new subscribers it brings in beyond the game's launch period. And whether they are prepared to implement a strategy to continually engage new subscribers into 2025."", ""Katan Games' Dr Serkan Toto believes there is pressure from Xbox to get this right."", '""We all know that Microsoft\'s gaming unit has not been growing as expected, which is why Microsoft greenlit the Activision Blizzard mega deal in the first place,” he said. “Now the pressure on Xbox is sky high: If Call of Duty will not make the Game Pass business model work, what possibly can?', '""Nobody knows what Microsoft\'s expectations are for Game Pass growth past launch, but if Black Ops 6 does not meet targets, things can become very grim very quickly. I also wonder if Black Ops 6 will be able to retain subscribers in the long run or if numbers will drop sharply again early next year, after the initial hype runs out.""', 'However, Pachter believes Call of Duty is the perfect game to keep users engaged.', '""Call of Duty players generally play for much longer because of multiplayer and frequent map drops,” he says. ""I think the average is closer to six months and a lot play year-round. The year-round players will sign up and stay.""', 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 6', 'PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC', 'All the biggest stories, expert analysis and data, straight to your inbox.', 'Advertisement', 'Black Ops 6 is make-or-break for the Game Pass strategy | Opinion', 'Opinion', 'The Not E3 hype season begins | Microcast', 'News', ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 continues Xbox's bet on Activision boost for Game Pass"", 'News', ""GamesIndustry.biz is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis. © 2024 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

‘Call of Duty’ Is Back. Here’s What to Know About ‘Black Ops 6’,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-explained-1235142787/,"['BY CADE ONDER', 'AS ANOTHER YEAR draws near its end, it’s time yet again for another Call of Duty game. For 2024’s iteration, Activision is taking fans back to a fan-favorite sub-series with Black Ops 6. However, if you’re new to the franchise or a lapsed fan looking to return after years away, the Call of Duty landscape may be a bit confusing. ', 'Unlike most games, Call of Duty has ditched individual applications and adopted a centralized hub, kind of like how Fortnite offers multiple game modes in a single ecosystem. When you launch the game, you’ll see multiple options to choose from, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Warzone in addition to Black Ops 6. Players only have access to the respective games they own, which are purchased piecemeal. It can be convenient if you’re regularly going back to different versions of the game, but might be off-putting if you’re just looking to pick up and play.', 'Even though they’re lumped together in the same app, Black Ops and Modern Warfare are vastly different games — despite what some fans may suggest. Not only do they feature different characters, stories, and tones, but they offer very different styles of gameplay too.', '', 'For the better part of a decade, Call of Duty was more or less a World War II anthology series. It was less focused on characters or big story arcs and more about allowing players a way to experience historical battles/military operations by way of an interactive take on Saving Private Ryan. In 2007, that all changed with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game was inspired by real life conflicts ripped straight from the headlines and would result in the franchise’s first direct sequel with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009). ', 'That sequel was the first time the series had reinvested in its characters and given players people to attach to. Modern Warfare would become known for its bombastic, contemporary stories with Michael Bay-sized set pieces and bravado, with larger than life characters defined by thick accents, bushy mustaches, and cool masks. After both games became monstrous hits, it was clear that fans wanted more serialized entries. However, for the sake of the developers (as well as the audience’s attention) it would be difficult to roll out a Modern Warfare sequel every year.', '', 'Activision opted to produce a semi-sequel to Call of Duty: World at War (2008) that would help launch another sub-series: Black Ops. This sub-franchise is far less focused on all-out warfare and more interested in espionage, honing in on conspiracy-laden takes on history and fictional shadowy operations carried out by the government. Call of Duty: Black Ops tackled all kinds of brainy subject matter such as Russian sleeper agents, the surgical role of the CIA in major world events in the Sixties, and even the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ', 'Both sub-franchises would continue to further develop their own identities as the years went on with Black Ops going to the far flung future to battle robots while the original Modern Warfare trilogy wrapped up in the early 2010s. Modern Warfare developer Infinity Ward would go on to try a few other new ideas for the series, such as Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016), but ultimately circled back to Modern Warfare to cash in on nostalgia.', '', 'In 2019, Infinity Ward released a Modern Warfare reboot that offered a more realistic take on its initial premise. If the original Modern Warfare trilogy was like an over-the-top Michael Bay film, the rebooted trilogy is more akin to grounded films like Zero Dark Thirty and Sicario. As such, Modern Warfare has become more of a casual military-sim that tries to balance realism with fun while Black Ops is the more “arcade-y” shooter that’s a bit easier to pick up and play.', '', 'It’s obviously a bit confusing for newcomers to keep track of the differences between the two Modern Warfare trilogies, as they literally shared the same name aside from a set of roman numerals. However, it’s understandable why Activision chose to keep using the Modern Warfare name. It’s an incredibly strong brand, synonymous with making Call of Duty a pop cultural juggernaut.', 'Similarly, Treyarch has never even attempted to ditch the Black Ops brand because of the power it holds for the series. It’s something fans trust and hold in high esteem.', 'The Call of Duty: Black Ops timeline is a bit chaotic as it takes place across roughly 100 years and also features a branching storyline. In Black Ops 2 (2012) and Black Ops Cold War (2020), the player can make choices that allow critical characters to live or die, nuke countries, and let the villains win or lose.', 'On top of that, the rebooted Modern Warfare (2019) series exists within the same universe as the Black Ops games. A lot of these connections have been made in seasonal post-launch cutscenes tied to the multiplayer of these games, but a key character from the Modern Warfare series also appeared in a cameo in the campaign for Black Ops Cold War.', 'With all of that said, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is more or less right in the middle of the timeline. Black Ops 6 is a sequel to Black Ops Cold War and the Eighties-set levels of Black Ops 2. Black Ops 6 picks up in the early Nineties and follows Cold War character Russell Adler on the run after being framed as a mole in the CIA. Sometime later, he sends a cryptic message to Frank Woods — who is now wheelchair-bound following the events of Black Ops 2 — to warn him of a dangerous group that has infiltrated the CIA. ', '', 'Key franchise characters like Alex Mason and Jason Hudson will not return in Black Ops 6 due to some choices players can make in Black Ops 2 now being officially canonized in the overall narrative. Below, you can find a chronological timeline of the Black Ops franchise’s story which should hopefully make things a bit easier to follow. The bolded entries on the list are the ones that you should play before Black Ops 6 if you want to have the best understanding of the story.', 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has had the longest development cycle of any Call of Duty game to date with Treyarch and Raven Software leading the charge on production. The series has historically allowed its different studios two to three years to make new games, but Black Ops 6 was afforded the luxury of four years. Ideally, it could result in a more polished, content-rich game than previous years.', '2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was reportedly made in 16 months and was heavily criticized for its painfully short campaign (roughly three hours long) and a multiplayer that launched exclusively with content from previous games such as maps from Modern Warfare 2 (2009).', 'Of course, there will be a robust campaign with missions that allow players to choose the kind of playstyles they want to utilize. Raven Software, the campaign developer for Black Ops 6, has also confirmed this year’s single player component will be longer than Black Ops Cold War’s which was under 6-hours long.', 'Zombies also returns with two new round-based maps, including one giant map set in West Virginia. Black Ops 6 will introduce a plethora of new features including a mech suit for players to utilize, new GobbleGums (a perk system exclusive to Zombies), and all kinds of whimsical weapons and gadgets to slay the undead with. To really sweeten the deal, a third Zombies map will also be released for Black Ops 6 by the end of 2024 at no extra cost.', 'The fan-favorite mode was introduced in World at War (2008) and has allowed the series to have a radically different co-op mode in addition to its single-player and PvP offerings. It became popular for its simplicity of surviving hordes of the undead, but evolved to become a campy experience that saw players as President John F. Kennedy, going to the moon, and fighting an undead version of horror director George Romero across different games.', '', 'Needless to say, it would seem like the chaos of this mode is kept in its own self-contained universe and doesn’t directly impact the campaigns of the Call of Duty games.', 'The co-op mode has grown substantially since its initial days of being a simple wave-based shooter and now touts elaborate puzzles, progression systems, and an ongoing storyline. For some fans, Zombies is the meat and potatoes of Call of Duty and they don’t really dabble in the other modes. There are even entire YouTube channels with millions of subscribers that are dedicated to covering Call of Duty’s Zombies mode.', 'And it wouldn’t be Call of Duty without multiplayer. The classic 6v6 action returns with 16 maps (including a remake of fan-favorite map, Nuketown) and all kinds of new mechanics. Most notably, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 boasts a new movement system which allows players to run, slide, and dive in any direction, giving them more precise control over their character. This “omnimovement” also results in much faster, more frenetic combat with more opportunities to make slick plays. ', 'Later this year, this system will also be implemented into Call of Duty: Warzone, a free-to-play battle royale spin-off, which should dramatically overhaul how the beloved battle royale plays. After releasing in 2022, Warzone has become something of the connective tissue between games, continuously updated each year to reflect some of the major gameplay changes introduced in the annualized entries.', 'Both the mainline entries and Warzone are iterating upon each other as Warzone takes on mechanical innovations such as movement changes while titles like Modern Warfare III have utilized the battle royale’s maps and armor system within their campaigns. ', 'For those that have heavily invested in Call of Duty over the last few years by purchasing skins and aggressively leveling up their gear, there’s some bad news. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does not feature the “carry forward” system that was introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The system allowed players to bring their skins, guns, and relevant gear from Modern Warfare II to Modern Warfare III.', '', 'This was partially done because Modern Warfare III was more like Modern Warfare 2.5 rather than a full-fledged sequel, making it easier for the developers to include content from a previous game.', 'However, Black Ops 6 plays a lot different from Modern Warfare III and features a different art style, so it wouldn’t make sense for all of the stuff from the last two games to be accessible here. Modern Warfare III featured some a ton of contemporary crossovers with skins for real life celebrities like Devin Booker and Nicki Minaj as well as characters from big films like Dune: Part Two.', 'Naturally, it would be weird for a game that’s set in the Nineties to feature characters like this, though there will probably be some other crossovers in Black Ops 6’s post-launch content. Thankfully, all content from past games will still be usable in Call of Duty: Warzone. Similarly, Black Ops 6 skins and weaponry will also be usable in Call of Duty: Warzone.', '', 'While all of that is certainly a lot to take in, you’re ready to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It may be overwhelming at a glance, but Call of Duty is popular because it is first and foremost very accessible. It’s meant to be a shooter that anyone can pick up and play. While you may be a bit fuzzy on some specifics if you’ve never played another Call of Duty or you’ve taken some years off, just sit back and enjoy the ride. ', 'Whether you’re looking for a quick dopamine hit in multiplayer, wanting a high-quality, blockbuster-level story, or want to mindlessly mow down Zombies with your friends, Black Ops 6 has something for just about everyone.', 'We want to hear it.

Aim assist is always a hot topic within the Call of Duty community with each game’s release, so it will be interesting to see feedback now the game is out in the wild.', 'Elsewhere, there are improved pistol and dedicated melee swap speeds, a slight increase to weapon butt melee attack speeds, and adjustments to sway, bob, and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS (aim down sights).', 'Helpfully, Activision included a weapon damage range explainer in the patch notes, which go into detail on how damage actually works in Black Ops 6 and Warzone from Season 01.', ""We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including its built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20, Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters, and confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded Riot Shield."", 'MULTIPLAYER', 'There are 33 weapons at launch waiting for you to unlock and customize.

Weapon balance is always ongoing, so we’ll be evaluating data and feedback, and sharing updates on this regularly.', 'Keen eyes have already noticed a handful of changes we have introduced to our Beta maps thanks to everyone’s amazing feedback. Delivering fair and consistent gameplay will always remain our goal, and as such we’ve introduced some additional cover and changes to make firefights a bit fairer, as well as various lighting changes.

Another upgrade: intelligent movement, which lets players customize certain moves including running and crouching.', ""This latest entry in the series comes after publisher Activision celebrated the franchise's 20th anniversary last October with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III."", 'A consistent blockbuster game release with annual editions every year since 2003, the initial Call of Duty games were based on World War II – and the franchise initially launched on Windows PCs.', 'Game designers and creators have constantly evolved the releases, changing the field of battle, moving to video game consoles, then to 24/7 online multiplayer games, and onto mobile devices. The settings have moved to the Vietnam War, to the present day and into the future – including space.', '“We’ve had so many great games and some big inflection points for us,” said Rob Kostich, president of Activision Publishing. “But it’s just continued to be a mainstay in culture.”', 'Call of Duty has been the bestselling video game franchise in the U.S. market for 15 consecutive years since the 2009 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, according to data from Circana Retail Tracking Service. The only years during that period where a Call of Duty game was not the bestselling individual title of the year were 2013 with Grand Theft Auto V, 2018 with Red Dead Redemption II and 2024 with Hogwarts Legacy.', 'Activision Blizzard has sold more than 400 million Call of Duty video games over the years. Tens of millions play the annual video game release, which has grown to include single-player story campaigns and other modes including online multiplayer and cooperative games.', 'But Call of Duty is even bigger than that: Its free-to-play Call of Duty Mobile launched in 2019, has racked up more than 500 million downloads. Call of Duty: Warzone, a free-to-play game for consoles and PCs launched in 2020 and has topped 100 million players, along with a mobile version launched in 2024.', 'Call of Duty got its start when a squad of developers who had worked on the 2002 PC game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault left that development studio 2015 Inc. to form Infinity Ward. The LA-area studio would create a pair of World War II-based games including Call of Duty 2, which included a mission in which the player had to survive the D-Day invasion – inspired by the Normandy assault scene in the film ""Saving Private Ryan,"" directed by Steven Spielberg, who scripted and executive produced the initial Medal of Honor games.', '“We attempted to make the situation for the individual player as chaotic and stressful as it must have been for some people on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944,"" Dale Dye, a retired captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, who served as an adviser on the Medal of Honor games, told USA TODAY in 2002. ""The goal is to provide the player with some understanding and appreciation for a combat soldier\'s battlefield experience,” said Dye, who also served as a consultant on films such as “Saving Private Ryan,” “Band of Brothers” and “Platoon.""', 'Here’s a look at where the Call of Duty games have taken players over the years:', 'Players joined U.S., British and Soviet forces fighting their way through historic World War II battles such as the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of Stalingrad. The game was awarded 2003 Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, the equivalent of the video game industry’s Oscars.', 'This game for GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, built on the original Call of Duty PC release, includes new missions in North Africa and Germany. You also get to drive tanks.  AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson voices one of the characters.', 'A launch title for Microsoft\'s new Xbox 360, this game hit Windows PCs first and put players in a pivotal position during D-Day attempting to take Pointe du Hoc, a German-held clifftop between Omaha and Utah beaches. Better chips in PCs and the Xbox 360 allowed the designers to craft smarter squad mates and enemies. ""You can actually hear where (enemy and fellow soldiers) are on the battlefield,"" said Vince Zampella, who at the time was Infinity Ward\'s chief creative officer. ""To your left, you are going to hear them calling out, \'There\'s Nazis on your right-hand side, second window! They\'ve got a machine gun,\' or \'We are taking fire!\'""', 'Players on GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox got to enlist in this additional World War II story line as part of the U.S. Army\'s famed 1st Infantry Division. The game introduced aerial combat, which would become a standard in subsequent releases. Mark Hamill provided voiceover commentary and several actors from the HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" voiced characters, too.', 'This game, developed by Treyarch (a game development studio like Infinity Ward, acquired by Activision), featured digitally scanned actors and uniforms combined with squadron-sized motion-capture sessions. World War II veterans were consulted. New features aimed to get ""closer to what happens in a real fight,"" said retired Army Lt. Col. Hank Keirsey, a consultant on this and other Call of Duty games.', ""The first Call of Duty game to venture beyond World War II into modern-day geopolitical situations and international intrigue with nukes, an anti-U.S. Middle Eastern warlord and an ultranationalist Russian terrorist involved. The game's multiplayer mode established Call of Duty as a favorite for online players. Along with Call of Duty 2, this game is considered among the best video games of all time."", 'Actors Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman provided voices for characters in this World War II-based game with action on the Pacific and Eastern fronts including Russia and Germany. World at War was also the first to include a totally separate game mode where players battled zombies. Also released in 2008 was Call of Duty: World at War – Final Fronts, a counterpart to World at War and the last Call of Duty game developed for the PlayStation 2. ', 'This picked up the story about ultranationalist Russians threatening world peace from 2007\'s Modern Warfare and included an episode involving a terrorist attack that got a lot of attention. It wasn\'t meant purely to shock, but to bring to players ""the shape of modern warfare these days: violence against citizens,"" said Jesse Stern, a writer and executive producer with the TV series NCIS who helped studio Infinity Ward on the game. Sales topped $1 billion, surpassing box office receipts for top films.', 'The first Call of Duty Black Ops game was set in the Cold War, with action in Cuba, Russia and Vietnam. Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Ice Cube and Sam Worthington added voices and ""The Dark Knight"" screenwriter David Goyer consulted. At the time, the game went on to become the top-selling game ever, selling more than 25 million copies.', 'This completion of a trilogy begun five years earlier includes a Russian invasion of the U.S. At the outset of the game, you must fight your way through Wall Street to destroy a radar jamming tower. Players would feel ""the impact of fighting through New York,"" said Infinity Ward creative strategist Robert Bowling. There was conflict behind the scenes too: During the making of the game, Activision terminated Infinity Ward co-founders Vince Zampella and Jason West. The two in March 2010 filed a suit, which was settled in 2012, and they started a new studio, Respawn Entertainment, which created the new Titanfall franchise.', ""This game not only continued the story from 2010's Black Ops but also took players into the future with weaponized drones and other sci-fi technology – and it had different endings. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails created a theme song for the game too. And you could stream your game on YouTube."", 'The first stand-alone game in the series in several years, Ghosts is set in the near future and included an outer space battle straight out of ""Moonraker,"" as well as an underwater mission and another played from the point of view of a military-trained German shepherd named ""Riley."" A new perk: You could also create a woman soldier in the game\'s multiplayer game mode. This was the first Call of Duty game available for the Sony PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.', 'Kevin Spacey played the head of a Blackwater-style private military company with imperialist ambitions in this game, set 40 years in the future. You don an exoskeleton, which gives you superpowered leaping and hovering power. This was the first game in the series developed by the studio Sledgehammer Games, which previously collaborated on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. ""The Hurt Locker"" writer and producer Mark Boal assisted on the story.', ""Black Ops 3 picks up the action from Black Ops 2 and moves to the year 2065 – a futuristic story totally separate from 2014's Advanced Warfare – when super-soldiers have augmented body parts and built-in data jacks to connect to computer networks. The game also allowed for up to four to play and progress together, to help less-skilled players advance in the game. For the seventh consecutive year, Call of Duty was the top-selling video game in the U.S."", 'More future-based action, but this time with actor Kit Harington (""Game of Thrones"") playing a villain bent on destroying Earth. Much of the combat takes place in space with starship battles à la ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars."" The setting ""allowed for some incredible innovations like Zero-G combat and space dogfighting,"" said then-Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg.', 'The video game franchise returned to World War II for the first time in nearly a decade with actor Josh Duhamel (""Transformers"") providing the likeness, voice and motion for one of the game\'s main characters. You again help the Allies advance on Normandy and, later, become immersed in a tank battle, and eventually make your way to occupied France and into Germany.', 'The first edition to drop the single-player story campaign, this online multiplayer included ""Blackout,"" its own take on the ""battle royale"" game genre, popularized by ""Fortnite.""', ""This free-to-play game for Android and iOS devices included a battle royale mode for up to 100 players, plus other popular multiplayer games such as Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, and Domination on well-known maps from the games' history."", 'A modern-day game – photo-realistic settings were created in 3D photogrammetry software – that brings back the characters from 2007\'s Modern Warfare. ""We wanted to reboot the franchise … with the characters we knew and loved,"" said Activision Publishing CEO Rob Kostich. ""We wanted to tell new stories in new ways and bring Modern Warfare to the modern day."" In addition to reengaging with familiar characters, you also play part of the game as a female Middle Eastern freedom fighter.', 'A free game to compete with ""Fortnite,"" with crossplay across consoles and PCs with up to 150 players in its Battle Royale Mode. Quickly, the game grew to 100 million players and constantly gets new content.', 'The premise here is somehow, the Russians swiped a U.S. nuke in 1968 and now that mistake has come back to haunt the Reagan Administration. Familiar characters from previous Black Ops games appear too. The first installment of the series is playable on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.', 'You face missions as four different characters in this World War II-based game – one of them based on Ludmila Pavlichenko, Russia\'s most successful real-world female sniper known as ""Lady Death."" New tough adversaries, nearly unstoppable soldiers called jagermorders, are deployed by the Führer\'s successor to thwart you.', 'This sequel to 2019\'s ""Modern Warfare"" reboot continues Task Force 141\'s fight against terrorists. Along the way you must guide a missile to its target, disarm another missile, provide air support to your squad and, at one point, you are hurt and unarmed and must use stealth to escape.', 'This game, due out Nov. 10, is the first time the franchise has carried forward a story in back-to-back years – and picks up after the cliffhanger ending of ""Modern Warfare II."" ""This is a first for us,"" Kostich said. ""You see this theatrically all of the time, \'The Avengers\' have done it.""', 'Four years after releasing Warzone, Activision adapted it into a free-to-play mobile game that allows players to link to their Activision ID and sync progression, weapons, friends and more if they\'ve already played Warzone on a console or computer. ""We\'re using the same animation, movement and weapon systems, all that stuff is just adapted for a mobile device,"" said Chris Plummer, Activision\'s head of mobile.', ""Several returning characters from past Black Ops games are joined by newcomers who collectively face a conspiracy inside the CIA that has continued to escalate as the Cold War ebbs. Action takes place across the globe – in Russia, southern Europe and the U.S. – amid unrest in the Middle East and the 1991 U.S.-led coalition's assault to combat Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Oh, there's a biological weapon in play, too.""]"
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review,https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review,"['Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our multiplayer review in progress and our Zombies mode review in progress.', '', ""A spy thriller worthy of the name, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's campaign is a hugely welcome reinvigoration of the long-running first-person shooter series. It looks back at what has historically made the best CoD single-player modes so great and throws its own exciting and novel ideas into the mix, to fantastic effect. Telling one of the most engaging stories the series has ever seen, Black Ops 6’s enticing variety and impressive scale provide a stellar return to form."", ""Ever since the 2003 original, CoD campaigns have been heavily influenced by military action movies – starting in a logical place with classic WW2 cinema like The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan before moving on to more contemporary influences, in particular the panoramic yet still claustrophobic camerawork of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down."", ""But the lens shifted focus away from theatres of full-scale war and onto spy thrillers in the mold of the Mission: Impossible and Bourne series, beginning with 2010’s Black Ops and evolving into a refined, enthralling form with Black Ops 6. It’s in this distinctive direction that the returning Adler and Woods team up with a new team of skilled operators, this time in 1991, to combat an emerging new threat called The Pantheon, amid rumors of the creation of a potentially history-changing bioweapon. Sure, 2020's Cold War had its fair share of espionage action, but the majority of Black Ops 6's missions don't take place on the flashes and bangs of the frontline, but in the shadows that lie deep behind it."", ""Two missions in particular showcase this brilliantly: the infiltration of a political gala in Most Wanted, and the casino heist of High Rollers. The former presents three different options for how you want to go about completing your objective - I had a great time tinkering with a silent auction, but other paths are available that will test your spy skills - and while your choice has no lasting impact on the story, it does add an element of replayability to otherwise linear levels. The heist, by contrast, has you swapping between multiple members of your blacklisted team, spread across lavish slot machine-filled surroundings and the dank underground waterways beneath. You don't get to swap freely, but the slick character baton-passes add another dash of cinematic flair."", ""There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach other missions as well. Stealth is often encouraged, but going loud is almost always an option (with insta-fail stealth thankfully only rearing its ugly head on one or two occasions). Keeping to the shadows or hidden underwater made me feel like a silent assassin, but when I let that slip I had to swiftly switch to a more combative style."", 'Gunplay, crucially, delivers in both areas, with suppressed headshots satisfyingly pinging brains out of heads in one trigger pull and rattling SMGs and punchy shotguns feeling great when manically dashing in and out of cover thanks to the exciting new “omnimovement” system. This completely revamped movement mechanic allows you to sprint in any direction, as well as leap into the air sideways while firing to pull off your best gun-fu-esque stunts.', ""There's a great sense of improvisation as well. Weapons need to be constantly discarded and replaced with whatever gun is within grasp due to ammo sometimes being kept cleverly sparse. That also applies to the more DIY methods of dispatching enemies that are available, such as grabbing knives from chopping boards to then send them flying into skulls. Again, it evokes that espionage action movie feel, letting me briefly cosplay as John David Washington brutalising his way through a restaurant kitchen in Tenet."", ""The variety of its levels and top-tier presentation makes sure that it's never once dull, but this is a feat of stamina as well: By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest, clocking in at just around eight hours for me (roughly twice the length of Modern Warfare 3’s dud of a mission chain). It’s no Baldur’s Gate 3, certainly, but that’s a respectable runtime for a shooter campaign."", 'I do wish, though, that Call of Duty had more tricks up its sleeve by now when it comes to adding difficulty and differences to enemy encounters. Even now, after so many games, it’s still resorting to simply chucking a juggernaut or two your way to unload full magazines into when it wants to ramp up the stakes, but this time these challenges are occasionally solved via more interesting means thanks to a range of spy gadgets handed out at regular intervals. A throwing knife that can home in on targets adds a welcome dose of Batman energy to proceedings, and the trusty explosive remote control RC-XD cars make a fun return. Naturally, if all goes wrong, you can always rely on the more rustic C4 option to blow up anything you need it to.', 'When downtime is had between outings, the writing hits a fun sweet spot between cliché and self-awareness and is supported by a cast that fully buys into their roles. Bruce Thomas in particular is in great form as the brazenly enigmatic Russell Adler, and Y’lan Noel and Karen David make a great first impression as Marshall and Sevati, respectively. The latter has a lot of fun in her chameleon-like role as a master-of-disguise assassin, with new personas taken on from mission to mission.', '', ""You'll spend more time with them when you return to the safe house, where you can learn more about your teammates' backstories, solve puzzles, and purchase valuable upgrades using cash found on missions. These perks range from standard stuff like explosive damage negation to ones that are more traditionally found in multiplayer modes, such as Last Stand, which gives you a temporary health and speed boost when close to death. It's a further example of the increased flexibility in game design and the way that developer Raven Software is encouraging you to adopt your own playstyle."", ""Your sizeable Bulgarian manor is also home to dormant KGB secrets, which I had a great time uncovering. While none of the puzzles are too brain-testing – usually amounting to just memorising a series of numbers or using trial and error to unlock terminals – they successfully add even further variety to an otherwise (expectedly) gun-heavy time. It's surprisingly involved, and a fantastic improvement on an idea that began as a small abandoned garage in 2020’s Cold War, serving as a great place to plan for heists, undercover operations, and the completely unexpected."", ""Speaking of which… I won't say too much here so as not to spoil it, but perhaps the best mission of the whole campaign riffs off of previous Black Ops hallucinogenic episodes to create something that touches on the likes of BioShock, Prey, and Control in both its aesthetic and level design. It's hard to know which of Black Ops 6's many great missions will ultimately be remembered most fondly, but I have a feeling it might just be the weirdest that cements its place as an all-timer."", ""That isn't to say you're kept completely out of more traditional combat zones. The first Gulf War serves as the backdrop for Black Ops 6's story, and you do spend a couple of missions in the ‘90s Middle East. This allows for the mission design to return to its modern military roots, but does so by innovating on the Call of Duty formula, which is best exemplified in a mid-game mission that is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series of campaigns."", ""Taking place over a vast desert map, you're given the task of destroying three SCUD missile sites in any order and by any means of your choosing. Feel like driving straight through the front door in a jeep? Go for it. It may be much more advisable to pick off a few targets from afar and think about things more methodically, though. Points of interest are also dotted around the map, and those can reveal themselves to be anything from special equipment supply drops to SAS scouts who show you enemy locations. These areas are worth exploring, too, as certain side objectives are built into the larger main mission design, such as when I blew up three different enemy SAM encampments to free up the airspace and allow me to take control of a helicopter's buzzsaw of a machine gun later on. This choice and consequence system is further explored in an equally exciting later mission, too, and is one of Black Ops 6’s true masterstrokes."", 'It\'s a fantastic use of everything Call of Duty does at its best, and a ludicrously better example of how it can borrow from its Warzone and multiplayer modes to build something truly exciting in an open space that blows last year’s feeble attempt out of the water. It frankly puts Modern Warfare 3\'s ""open"" mission design to shame, and shows the worth of granting a development team more than a handful of months to cobble together a campaign.', ""Although enthralling to play, the fact that these missions take place during Operation Desert Storm doesn't serve the story in anywhere near as fulfilling a way, making the controversial conflict come across more like window dressing. They don't delve into, or address in a meaningful manner, any of the human issues at play that surrounded the conflict in 1991 Kuwait, Iraq, and the larger Gulf area. Black Ops 6 tries to have its cake and eat it too; you can't “keep politics out of video games” when the game in question painstakingly recreates several real-life world leaders and the wars their governments partook in to set the stage for its ensuing fireworks."", ""Modern Warfare 3’s campaign commits the biggest sin possible for a globe-trotting action thriller: it's boring. What had the promise to be an intriguingly spun web of mystery instead ends up being a dusty cobweb you'd find at the back of your shed, clinging onto 15-year-old garden toys you once had fun with. It's a pale imitation of the past, made up of underbaked story moments that clash with attempts to introduce new open combat missions designed to encourage player freedom that instead fall flat on their face. Yes, the gunplay is still great and the graphics and sound design are top-tier, but I couldn't help but feel I was playing a shinier, less subtle version of something I've played too many times before. If this is the quality we've come to expect from Call of Duty campaigns, maybe it's for the best if a year or two is taken to reset and raise this low bar back to the heights of old. - Simon Cardy, November 3, 2023"", 'Read the full Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Campaign Review', ""Instead, this is a story that’s far more concerned with being a popcorn spy thriller than it is with examining or even reacting to its own subject matter, which in and of itself isn't a fundamental issue – but after Modern Warfare’s weak argument against chemical weapons in 2019 and Modern Warfare 3's refusal to use terrorism for anything more than cheap thrills just last year, Black Ops 6 follows an unfortunate trend of recent CoD campaigns declining to offer an emotionally nuanced reading of the settings they take on. It's no doubt entertaining, and I’m not exactly looking for (nor expecting) a deep, forensic examination of the cultural cost of global conflicts here, but it still feels like the latest instalment in a series of missed opportunities. There is room to both entertain and say something real, as so many of the war and spy movies CoD emulates already do, and 2012's Spec Ops: The Line is often praised for (even though its conflict is fictionalised)."", 'What is delivered is a constantly engaging spy thriller story as the exiled Woods, Adler, and a string of new faces go off the record to decipher the links between the CIA, Saddam Hussein, and The Pantheon. What begins as a fairly standard cloak-and-dagger plot really comes alive in the back half, managing to weave in personal stakes and treats for long-time Black Ops fans. The nature of its closing chapter crept up and honestly surprised me, somehow managing to balance a bombastic crescendo with genuine emotive strain. It’s as good as a Call of Duty plot has been in a long, long time.', '', ""A shout-out must also go to the quality animation on display, a technical area that can sometimes be taken for granted when it comes to Call of Duty. Whether it's intricate gun reloads and the mechanical finesse of your weapons when fired during gameplay, or the sheer fidelity of the cutscenes, it truly is best-in-class work."", 'An excellent string of missions that offer variety and flexibility come together to make the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years. Black Ops 6 is a fantastic return to form for the series, allowing the designers at Raven to delve deep into their bag of tricks and keep you guessing at every turn. It successfully makes each chapter distinct from one another, whilst maintaining a strong level of quality across the board. Packing a thoroughly engaging story that gets better the longer it goes on, it exceeds expectations regarding level design and creativity, showing that when given the time to craft them properly, CoD campaigns still have what it takes to be up there with the best first-person shooters.', '']"
Call of Duty Black Ops 6 patch notes boost XP after some modes are found lacking,https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/patch-notes-boost-xp-multiplayer,"['Call of Duty Black Ops 6 patch notes are here, boosting XP gains on several CoD multiplayer modes that were “awarding less than expected.”', 'Ken Allsop', 'Published: 1 day ago', 'New Call of Duty Black Ops 6 patch notes have arrived, fixing a few key issues with multiplayer and CoD zombies in the latest game from Treyarch and Activision. The first Call of Duty to come out on Game Pass day one following the Microsoft acquisition, Black Ops 6 has so far kept me much more entertained than its predecessor, Modern Warfare 3. However, crashes and bugs are still blighting many PC players, leaving the new game with a ‘mixed’ reception on Steam. As it works on fixes, the Treyarch team announces its first CoD update since the official launch.', 'I’ve been having a lot of fun with the Call of Duty Black Ops 6 multiplayer. Perhaps it’s the lengthy break I took after not clicking with MW3, but the decision to introduce several new high-chaos smaller maps is very much in my wheelhouse, and has kept me locked in for some of my best multiplayer games of CoD in a while. The spawns certainly leave something to be desired, especially on those new close-quarters Black Ops 6 maps, but for the time being, I’ve been too swept up in the mayhem to mind.', 'If you’ve been playing, you might have noticed that some match types weren’t delivering the experience rewards you were hoping for. I’ve certainly felt like there was a large discrepancy between the payout I was getting at the end of rounds, and now Treyarch confirms that it has just “increased XP and weapon XP rates for modes that were awarding less XP than expected.” This issue affects some of the most popular Black Ops 6 modes, including Team Deathmatch, Control, Search and Destroy, and Gunfight, so it’s a very welcome fix.', 'That should make it a lot easier to unlock and rank up all the Black Ops 6 weapons you want, although you’ll now no longer be able to earn XP by spamming out decoy grenades. You can now also select any options in the firing range regardless of your progression, meaning you can plan your best Black Ops 6 loadout ahead of time. Additionally, the last-selected loadout should now be correctly highlighted when you open the in-game menu.', 'Elsewhere, Treyarch has fixed out-of-bounds exploits on Babylon, Lowtown, and Red Card. It’s also fixed “an issue that was occasionally preventing matches from quickly finding a replacement player in the case that another player quit the match.” You’ll also notice improved performance in both the Black Ops 6 Theater Mode and Training Course, and private matches will no longer automatically end if one team has no players.', 'Over in the Zombies mode, meanwhile, there are a few tweaks. A Terminus side quest that wasn’t ending correctly now should. The undead hordes will no longer stop spawning unexpectedly in Liberty Falls. SAM Trials that were not showing up have been resolved, and the Wonderbar GobbleGum now gives you the Wonder Weapon it promises.', '', 'That’s all for this latest update. There are no real campaign changes to speak of, aside from a fix to the ‘mute licensed music’ setting, which was apparently playing up in certain cases.

It also fixes an issue that was occasionally preventing matches from quickly finding a replacement player in the case that another player quit the match.', 'Moreover, this update improves performance when watching clips in Theater. It also improves server stability in the Training Course.

In the last two decades, Frank Woods has been deceived, maimed, and even tricked into killing one of his own.', 'Now it’s 1991, Woods is in charge of a team of new faces, and still looking for revenge. That’s where you come in. The Black Ops 6 campaign kicks off as Sargent Woods sends you to Kuwait for the first of 11 missions. As you work through them, don’t forget there’s a collection of Black Ops 6 campaign rewards for completing each mission in the single-player game, and even more for completing specific challenges.', 'Here are all 11 of the Call of Duty BO6 campaign missions in order:', '“Can’t believe Livingstone’s putting me and Harrow together in the field again. Been a while. Woods says this Saeed Alawi must be worth a migraine or three.”', 'Following a present day cutscene, flash back to you, as Marshall, and Harrow with boots on the ground in Kuwait to intercept Alawi’s convoy – just make sure you bring him in alive.', '', '“Woods says he doesn’t trust Sevati Dumas, but he says that about everyone else, too. It might be rubbing off on me. Just do whatever you need to do in Avalon to bring her into the fold.”', 'In the second mission, you must investigate a Pantheon lead in Avalon while helping Demas with her own mission. Remember the Black Ops 6 tagline, though, “In a time when the enemy has eyes everywhere, how do you know who to trust?”', '“Thanks to Felix, we learned that Livingstone threw Adler into a black site under the streets of DC. Not a place you’ll find in a tourist guide. Hell, we just brought him in… and now we gotta go and break him out.”', 'Familiar face Russell Adler needs rescuing from a CIA black site in Washington DC – expect fancy, patriotic surroundings and a location you might recognize from multiplayer map Gala. Now, the team is really starting to come together.', '', '“Who the hell wants a weapon demonstration under a palace in the desert? Saddam Hussein is who. We’re gonna hightail it over there posing as Delta Force operatives to see what the latest flavor of the month is.”', 'Things are really getting political now as you try to gain access to Saddam Hussein’s palace in the Iraqi desert. To get there, you’ve got to help the SAS out first.', '“Whatever Saddam’s hiding under that palace of his sounds like it’s a special delivery straight from the Pantheon.”', 'Now you’ve done the hard work to gain access to the palace, it’s time to infiltrate and uncover the Pantheon’s weapon – The Cradle.', '“Uncle Sam was cooking up something special in Kentucky before the secret recipe got out. We’re getting boots on the ground to find out what’s going on.”', 'Locate the source – or should that be sauce? – of The Cradle.', '', '“Felix dug into the video on that disk and heard Pantheon referencing a casino in Avalon. Think it’s time to brush up on my poker skills.”', 'It’s time to go undercover at one of the Pantheon’s favorite locations, Casino Luttazzi, or, more specifically, it’s archive room.', '“Adler’s got a buddy in CENTCOM who may be able to get us to the airport in Kuwait. It’s in a hot zone though. Better come through – once Gusev gets in the air he’ll be totally off the map.”', 'Back in Kuwait, you need to capture Matvey Gusev before he gets away.', 'This mission starts immediately after Ground Control without returning to the Safe House. As Sev, infiltrate the Vorkuta Pantheon base where The Cradle is being kept and find out what you can.', '', '“I never imagined it would come to this with Jane. Adler’s plan may be risky, but we’ve got nothing to lost at this point.”', 'Now old allies have started to reveal their true selves, things a getting serious. Get Harrow to reveal the details of Pantheon’s imminent attack, and play as her back in Bulgaria.', '“Pantheon was able to track us all the way to the Rook. Thought we had more time, but whatever. Gonna leave it all on the field.”', 'In the final mission, stop Pantheon from getting to Harrow again, and stop her from escaping.', 'Those are the Black Ops 6 missions in order, so now you know what to expect when you settle into the latest COD campaign. If you’re wondering how long it’ll take you, we’ve got a separate guide on the BO6 length. Of course, the battle doesn’t end there as there’s multiplayer and Zombies to get stuck into. Prepare the best Black Ops 6 weapons for both, and take a look at the current selection of BO6 modes in the multiplayer game.', 'Danielle Rose As a guides writer at PCGamesN, Danielle knows what you’re looking for in a guide - mainly because she probably got stuck and asked the same question herself.

"The Call of Duty Black Ops 6 campaign is doing well, but crashes are a problem",https://www.pcgamesn.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/steam-reviews,"['Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Steam reviews are good, but the new CoD from Treyarch is being impacted by crashing and launching issues on PC.', 'Ed Smith', 'Published: 3 days ago', 'The Call of Duty Black Ops 6 campaign has already picked up some favorable responses from players, and is definitely an improvement on last year’s Modern Warfare 3. Where the 2023 edition of CoD felt like a single-player extension of Warzone, with minimal story, no decent set pieces, and a lot of rushed or reused levels, Black Ops 6 potentially ranks alongside Cold War and Ghosts (yes) as one of the most cohesive campaigns in the series’ recent history. But, despite the Black Ops 6 Steam reviews, some PC players report problems with crashes, or even say that they cannot get the FPS to launch.', 'If you want an overview of this year’s single-player mode, check out the full Black Ops 6 missions list, which outlines how long the campaign lasts and where it connects to other games in the series. It’s definitely worth playing. While CoD, in general, has become more of a multiplayer FPS game in the past decade, compelling some to skip the campaign entirely, Black Ops 6 is an extremely credible single-player effort. Just make sure you have all the Black Ops 6 safe house puzzle codes – you’re going to need them.', 'Over on Steam, the response to this year’s CoD campaign is enthusiastic. The bulk of the game is tied to the overall ‘Call of Duty’ store page, but the single-player has its own listing, so it’s possible to gauge players’ opinion of the story mode separately. More than 500 reviews have been shared for the Black Ops 6 campaign already; 75% of those are favorable, bestowing the game with an official ‘mostly positive’ rating.', '“Black Ops 6 is some of the most fun I have had in a long, long time with any Call of Duty,” one player writes. “I honestly can’t remember the last time I had so much fun in CoD.” “Black Ops 6 is so good,” another writes. “I’ve only come around for CoD 4 and Modern Warfare 2019 with most of the other entries not being of interest. But I can tell this is one of the great ones.”', 'Other PC players describe problems with Black Ops 6 either crashing or refusing to launch – there are multiple threads within the game’s Steam discussion boards citing either booting errors or mid-game freezes. “First time getting CoD through Steam,” one poster explains. “Installed the Call of Duty app and Black Ops 6 ‘DLC.’ The game just closes instantly.” “One game goes good,” another player writes, “then back to the lobby, then it will start the match countdown, then just freeze up for no reason.”', 'Some players say they have fixed these issues either by uninstalling and reinstalling Call of Duty or updating various drivers on their PCs. Updating to the latest version of Windows has also reportedly helped in some cases.', 'Once you get into the new CoD, make sure you have the best Black Ops 6 loadouts. We’ve also got the full Black Ops 6 zombies maps list, so you can choose the best battlefield for your fight against the undead.', 'You can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.', 'Ed Smith Previously of Edge, Vice, Polygon, and the BBC, Ed is symbiotically connected to the gaming news matrix, covering everything from Cities Skylines 2 road tools, to Half-Life mods, and classic boomer shooters.
