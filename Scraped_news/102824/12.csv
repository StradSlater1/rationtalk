That was nearly 2 percentage points lower than the 55.93％ in the last Lower House election in 2021 — the third-lowest turnout in the postwar era — according to NHK.', 'Some LDP members have reportedly argued that Ishiba should resign since he set a majority as the benchmark for success.', 'Shinjiro Koizumi, chair of the LDP’s election committee, has indicated his intention to resign, suggesting that discussions regarding the responsibility of the party leadership were already gaining steam, according to NHK.', 'The LDP and Komeito had a comfortable 288 seats before the Lower House was dissolved on Oct. 9. But the LDP, with 191 seats, and Komeito, with 24, only managed to secure a combined 215 seats, falling short of the 233 needed for a simple majority.', 'Early Monday, LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama expressed regret at not achieving a majority.', ""“It is a very challenging time, and I want to do my best to prevent any confusion in national politics while working on the supplementary budget and next year's budget,” Moriyama said early Monday, adding that he does not intend to resign."", '', '', 'Meanwhile, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition force, significantly increased its seats to 148, from a preelection tally of 98.', ""CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda called this a “significant accomplishment,” since the party’s key goal had been to reduce the ruling coalition's majority."", 'But Noda said that more change was coming.', ""“If a change in government could happen right away, that would be the best outcome,” he told reporters early Monday. “However, I believe the phrase 'the night before a change in government' is undoubtedly becoming a reality. This is just the beginning.”"", 'At least one of two smaller opposition forces that also made gains in the election — Nippon Ishin no Kai or the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) — could now play the role of kingmaker for the ruling bloc.', 'The DPP won 28 seats, up from just seven before the election, making it the fourth-largest party in the Lower House. Nippon Ishin, the third-largest party, secured 38 seats, down from 43 before the Lower House was dissolved on Oct. 9.', 'Nippon Ishin had faced an uphill battle at the ballot box at a time when it sought to expand its influence outside the Kansai region.', 'Smaller parties such as Reiwa Shinsengumi won nine seats, while the Japanese Communist Party secured eight seats.', 'Meanwhile, the poll saw a record 73 female candidates win election, surpassing the previous high of 54 in the 2009 Lower House election.', '', '', 'LDP members who were not endorsed by the party due to their involvement in the slush funds scandal and won seats as independents may become the key if the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority. Ishiba could ask them for support in parliament.', 'Asked on a TV program whether he would endorse them immediately after the election, Ishiba said he is undecided — backpedaling from his earlier remark that endorsing them is an option.', '“During the election campaigning, there were voices against endorsing them,” Ishiba said. “We need to consider whether that’s something the people will accept.”', 'On a separate TV program, Moriyama was asked Sunday whether the LDP would reach out to opposition parties such as Nippon Ishin or the DPP if the ruling coalition did not secure a majority, saying only that it was not the time yet to make such a decision.', 'The CDP had intensified its criticism of the LDP during campaigning, with a particular emphasis on the ruling party’s handling of its slush funds scandal.', 'Noda told Fuji TV that he will talk about cooperation with other parties at the party’s executive committee meeting Monday morning.', '""If it comes to a situation where we must compete for the prime minister\'s job, it’s only natural to go for it,” Noda said Sunday.', 'Yu Uchiyama, a political science professor at the University of Tokyo, said Noda’s centrist approach likely captured votes from moderate conservatives who were dissatisfied with the LDP, resulting in the main opposition party gaining ground.', '', '', 'But a total change of government is still unlikely, given that forming a coalition of multiple parties will be difficult for the opposition, he added.', '“The LDP will probably try to bring back some unaffiliated members or recruit a few opposition parties. However, as the Democratic Party for the People and Nippon Ishin no Kai have both ruled out a coalition with the LDP, we might end up with a minority government,” Uchiyama said.', 'In that case, we would likely see a partial coalition, where the LDP would need to secure opposition cooperation for each bill, he said.', 'Several candidates who were implicated in the LDP slush funds scandal lost their seats, including former education minister Hakubun Shimomura, Kazuyuki Nakane, Kentaro Uesugi, Kenichi Hosoda and Tamayo Marukawa.', 'But former economy minister and LDP policy chief Koichi Hagiuda, who was denied official party endorsement over his involvement in the funds scandal, won re-election in Tokyo’s No. 24 district in one of the nation’s most fiercely-fought races.', 'Komeito also faced a challenge in retaining single-seat constituencies in Kansai, one of its traditional strongholds, while the junior coalition partner saw its newly minded leader, Keiichi Ishii, lose in his own constituency in Saitama Prefecture.', 'Since taking office on Oct. 1, Ishiba has faced criticism over his flip-flops. During campaigning for the LDP presidency last month, Ishiba said he would dissolve the Lower House for a snap election after holding budget committee sessions so that voters would be able to see what his policy priorities are.', 'But when he became prime minister, he skipped the budget committee session in favor of earlier voting, reportedly after Moriyama advised him to do so.', '', '', 'Ishiba had also proposed an Asian version of NATO in his LDP presidential bid, which triggered opposition from other countries. He subsequently said after winning the presidency and becoming prime minister that the idea was more of a long-term goal.', 'The last days of campaigning for Sunday’s general election were marked by a controversy over the LDP’s funneling of political funds to local chapters where candidates implicated in the funds scandal who were denied formal party endorsements ran.', 'This might have dealt a critical blow on LDP candidates who were in tight races against their rivals in the electoral districts.', 'Sunday’s election is regarded as an early referendum on the newly established administration of Ishiba, who made a gamble by calling a snap election just eight days after becoming prime minister. The election also marked the first nationwide vote since the wide-ranging slush funds scandal rocked the LDP, dominating political debates of the past year.', 'A total of 465 seats, including single-seat districts and those under the proportional representation system, were contested Sunday.', '', '', 'In a time of both misinformation and too much information,\nquality journalism is more crucial than ever.\nBy subscribing, you can help us get the story right.', ""Recent polls have indicated Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito bloc might lose its majority in the lower chamber for the first time in 15 years."", 'Many century-old companies have a history of transformation to survive.

But whether this will again be Mr Ishiba, who had taken office only on Oct 1, is a big question mark.', 'What is clear, however, is that the 67-year-old is on very shaky ground after gravely misreading public anger over a slush fund scandal as he took a gamble in calling a snap election one year before Lower House lawmaker terms were to expire.', 'The LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito took 215 seats, down from 279 seats. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) emerged the biggest winner with 148 seats, up from 98 previously, but also still well short of the 233 majority.', 'Voter turnout was pegged at around 53.7 per cent, according to Kyodo News’ calculations.', 'The election results were extremely damning for the LDP, with a string of former Cabinet ministers ousted, including former economic revitalisation minister Akira Amari, 75, former education minister Hakubun Shimomura, 70, and former Olympic minister Tamayo Marukawa, 53.', 'Mr Ishiba, who retained his Tottori No. 1 district seat, said that it was obvious that the LDP had not gained the forgiveness and understanding of voters regarding the slush fund scandal. But he added that he was not thinking of resigning as PM.', ""By signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time."", '“It’s a very tough situation, and we are being judged extremely harshly,” he said. “Across the country, the debate focused on the scandal rather than on key policy issues of diplomacy, national security and social security.”', 'The CDP grew in strength from the 98 seats it had previously held, with secretary-general Junya Ogawa saying before the resuts were confirmed that it would be a “major turning point in politics” if the LDP-Komeito coalition failed to keep its majority.', '“We must prepare to take on greater responsibility than before,” he said.', 'The PM had set a simple majority of 233 seats for the LDP-Komeito coalition as the target going into the election. The public’s refusal to give him this mandate would increase pressure within the LDP for him to resign, given that he was chosen as party leader under fractious terms.', 'His main rival in the LDP leadership elections, former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi, said on Oct 27 after retaining her Nara No. 2 district seat: “My feeling about wanting to run the nation someday is unchanged.”', 'He would also have to fight tooth and nail for political survival, with options including bringing independent lawmakers into the fold, or to engage in uncomfortable power-sharing arrangements with other conservative opposition parties like the ascendant Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) and Japan Innovation Party (better known as the Nippon Ishin no Kai).', 'If all these paths were shut off, he could become Japan’s shortest-lived post-war prime minister, breaking the record of 54 days currently held by Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who led Japan from August to October 1945.', 'Nippon Ishin leader Nobuyuki Baba said on Oct 27 that he was “not thinking at all” about working with the LDP. DPFP leader Yuichiro Tamaki, meanwhile, said the party “might” cooperate with the LDP, but only on an issue-by-issue basis.', 'There is also a slim chance that a hotchpotch of fragmented opposition parties may coalesce around the leadership of former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, 67, who now heads the CDP, to make up numbers for a parliamentary majority.', 'Mr Noda rode a wave of dissatisfaction over the LDP’s handling of a slush fund scandal, in which dozens of lawmakers were found to have kept millions of yen of fundraising income off the books. He told crowded rallies that the “best way for political reform was a change of government”.', 'A hung parliament would be reminiscent of Japan’s political landscape in 1993, when the LDP ceded power for the first time since its founding in 1955. But the brittle coalition of eight opposition parties collapsed after a year.', 'Political leaders made desperate pleas to win votes since campaigning began on Oct 15. A tally by the Jiji News Agency showed that they collectively travelled a distance of 84,000km – enough to lap the world twice – in hopes of pushing their candidates across the line.', 'Experts said that the political uncertainty would have ramifications on domestic policymaking.', '“The future is chaotic, and the LDP is going to have a very difficult time managing parliamentary business or to even implement policies,” Dr Mikitaka Masuyama of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies told The Straits Times. “It would be another time of compromise, with politics of indecision.”', 'Sophia University political scientist Koichi Nakano told ST that the result should be chastening for a party that appears to have taken its dominance for granted.', '“The LDP is like the Titanic – it’s a big ship that takes time to make a turn,” he said. “The LDP tried to make amends through half-baked measures, but everything was too little, too late.”', '', ""Enjoying ST's content?

On Sunday, the LDP won just 191 seats – its worst result since 2009, when the party suffered its biggest defeat and was forced to hand control to an opposition party.', 'To remain in power, the LDP could try and bring other parties into its coalition or rule via a minority government, with both options putting Ishiba’s position as prime minister in jeopardy.', 'The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) won 148 seats, a significant increase from 98. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda said in a press conference Sunday, “Our goal was to break the ruling party’s majority, and we achieved it, which is a great accomplishment.”', 'Before the election, the LDP faced falling approval ratings and public discontent over one of the country’s biggest political scandals in decades. Families and households are facing increased financial burdens, which have been exacerbated by the weak yen, a sluggish economy and high inflation.', 'The funding scandal involved millions of dollars in undocumented political funds, with some factions in the party accused of paying lawmakers with the proceeds of fundraising sales as kickbacks, or failing to properly declare their income.', 'Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida tried to contain the damage by replacing several cabinet ministers and dissolving LDP factions, essentially coalitions within the party. But he faced calls to resign and announced in August that he would not run for a second term.', 'Ishiba reportedly said he would not officially endorse some party lawmakers caught up in the scandal, but they were allowed to run as independents.', 'The Prime Minister has also appeared to backtrack on a number of positions since becoming LDP president. He had supported legislation that could allow married women to keep their maiden names, but later said it called for “further discussion,” according to Kyodo News.', 'As defense minister, Ishiba was strong on deterrence as a security issue. Before the election, he proposed an Asian version of the NATO security bloc, an idea he has apparently dropped after it was rebuffed by the US.', 'Ishiba has also pledged financial help to low-income households, a higher minimum wage, and regional revitalization, according to Reuters. He promised a “full exit” from Japan’s high inflation rates, vowing to achieve “growth in real wages.”', 'Japan’s elections come just over a week before the United States votes for a new President. Ishiba has made strengthening Japan’s relations with the US a priority and seeks deeper ties with allies amid growing security challenges in Asia, including an increasingly assertive China and belligerent North Korea.', 'Partnership with Japan has long been central to US strategy in the Asia-Pacific region, and Ishiba’s predecessor Kishida this year expanded Japan’s defense cooperation with its key ally. Ishiba has called for a more balanced relationship, including having greater oversight of US military bases in Japan, Reuters reported.', 'On Monday, Ishiba told reporters Japan “will strengthen our ties with the United States even more” and maintain the “extremely good Japan-US relationship and work to strengthen the free and open international order.”', 'In a political culture that prizes conformity, Ishiba has long been something of an outlier, willing to criticize and go against his own party. That willingness to speak out has made him powerful enemies within the LDP but endeared him to more grassroots members and the public.', 'Now, the jockeying for power will kick off with all parties seeking alliances to secure enough seats to form a government.', 'Ishiba and the LDP’s political future is uncertain, and one of the world’s most important economies faces a period of instability until upper house elections next summer.', 'This story has been updated with additional information.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Yet his popularity tanked as he U-turned on a number of policies – including creating an Asian version of Nato, support for same-sex marriage and the right for married individuals to choose to keep different surnames – after entering office.', 'Sunday’s election was held amid an atmosphere of deep voter apathy in Japan, with little fanfare or excitement seen on the streets of Tokyo. Voters described being put off the LDP by the slush fund scandal yet reluctant to vote for the opposition given their lack of experience running the world’s fourth-largest economy.', 'This sentiment was borne out by the turnout figures, down almost two percentage points to 53.84 per cent as of the preliminary results at 9am on Monday morning.

A fractured opposition failed to emerge as a viable alternative when the public was looking for one.', 'Although severely bruised, the LDP still won more seats - 191 - than the biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), whose final tally stands at 148 seats.', '“This election appears to be about voters who are fed up with a party and politicians they see as corrupt and dirty. But it’s not one where they want to bring about a new leader,” said Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies.', ""And yet the old leadership's fate is unclear. The LDP's governing coalition has fallen short of the halfway mark - 233 seats in the 465-member Diet - after its ally Komeito lost several seats, including that of its chief."", ""Even with Komeito's 24 seats, the LDP will be unable to muster a majority."", 'It\'s a ""severe judgment"", said Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who was sworn in as prime minister only early this month after winning a tight party leadership race.', 'Voters had ""expressed their strong desire for the LDP to reflect and become a party that will act in line with the people\'s will"", he said on Sunday, as results emerged.', 'The hope was that Ishiba as leader could save the LDP at the ballot - rising discontent and plummetting ratings had forced out the last PM, Fumio Kishida.', 'Still, Ishiba took a gamble when he announced a snap election less than a month ago - and it has backfired.', 'Both he and his party underestimated the extent of public anger and, crucially, their willingness to act on it.', 'To stay in power, the LDP will now need to form a coalition with other parties it fought in the election. And it will do so from a position of significant weakness because it must negotiate and make concessions to survive.', 'It is hard to overstate how rare this is - the LDP has always enjoyed a safe and steady place in Japanese politics.', 'And it has a strong track record of governance – when the opposition did take over in 1993 and 2009, it ended badly.', 'Since the LDP came back to power in 2012, it has managed to win every election, almost uncontested. There has long been resignation about the status quo, and the opposition remains unconvincing to the Japanese people.', '“I think we [the Japanese] are very conservative,” Miyuki Fujisaki, a 66-year-old voter, told the BBC a few days before the election.', '“It’s very hard for us to challenge and make a change. And when the ruling party changed once [and the opposition took over], nothing actually changed in the end, that’s why we tend to stay conservative.""', 'Ms Fujisaki said that she had inititially been unsure who to vote for, especially with the fundraising scandal hanging over the LDP. But given that she had always voted for them, she said she was probably going to do the same this time too.', 'Although the main opposition party - the CDP - made significant gains, observers say these results are less about voters endorsing the opposition than about their ire with the LDP.', 'Despite voters wanting to hold their politicians accountable, “in [their] minds... there really is no-one else"" they trust to lead the country, Mr Hall said.', 'What that leaves Japan with is a weakened LDP and a splintered opposition.', 'The country has long been seen as a beacon of political stability, a haven for investors and a reliable US ally in an increasingly tense Asia Pacific. So the uncertainty is concerning not just for its own people, but also its neighbours and allies.', 'At home, a shaky coalition will not help with turning the economy around, raising wages and improving welfare for a rapidly ageing population.', 'And harder still will be the task of regaining the trust and respect of a public weary of politics.', 'Content creators are going viral for renovating abandoned Japanese homes for low prices - but is all as it seems?', 'The Chinese government has been accused of using online nationalism as a useful safety valve.', 'Nihon Hidankyo, a group of survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is recognised for its work to rid the world of nuclear weapons.', 'Alimentation Couche-Tard reportedly offered to pay over $47bn for the Japanese-owned retail giant.', 'A government spokesperson admitted ""minor editing"" had been made to the image after online speculation.', 'Copyright 2024 BBC.

The outcome may force the LDP or CDPJ into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government.', 'A poll by Nippon TV showed the ruling coalition would win 198 seats to the CDPJ’s 157, both well short of the 233 seats needed to reach a majority, as voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s party over a funding scandal and inflation.', '“It was a tough fight for the LDP,” Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP’s election chief, told NHK.', 'It was unclear from the projections whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba would still be able to secure a majority in parliament alongside its long-term coalition partner, the Komeito party.', 'Ishiba, 67, took office on October 1, replacing his predecessor Fumio Kishida who resigned after an outcry over slush fund practices among LDP legislators. Ishiba immediately announced a snap election in hopes of shoring up more support.', 'In his final campaign speeches on Saturday, Ishiba apologised for his party’s mishandling of funds and pledged “to restart as an equal, fair, humble and honest party”. He said only the LDP’s ruling coalition can run Japan with its experience and dependable policies.', 'But voters in the world’s fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.', '“I made my decision first and foremost by looking at their economic policies and measures to ease inflation,” Tokyo voter Yoshihiro Uchida, 48, told AFP on Sunday. “I voted for people who are likely to make our lives better.”', 'Local media speculated that Ishiba could potentially even resign immediately to take responsibility, becoming Japan’s shortest-serving prime minister in the post-war period.', 'The current record is held by Naruhiko Higashikuni who served for 54 days – four days more than British leader Liz Truss in 2022 – just after Japan’s 1945 defeat in World War II.', '“The LDP’s politics is all about quickly implementing policies for those who give them loads of cash,” 67-year-old Noda told his supporters on Saturday.', '“But those in vulnerable positions… have been ignored,” he added, accusing the government of offering insufficient support for survivors of an earthquake in central Japan.', 'Analysts suggest Ishiba could fall short of reaching his target, though his LDP was expected to remain the top party in Japan’s parliament as voters are sceptical about the opposition’s ability and experience.', 'Ishiba’s party is also being tested to break the legacy of the late Premier Shinzo Abe. Abe’s policies focused on security, trade and industry but largely ignored equality and diversity, and his nearly eight-year tenure led to the corruption, experts say.', '“The public’s criticisms against the slush funds scandal has intensified, and it won’t go away easily,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy. “There is a growing sense of fairness and people are rejecting privileges for politicians.”', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"
