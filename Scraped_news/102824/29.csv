OP-ED: Happy 120th anniversary to NYC subway system,https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/blog/55238156/op-ed-happy-120th-anniversary-to-nyc-subway-system,"[""On Oct. 27, 1904, the Interborough Rapid Transit company opened the first subway line in New York City (NYC).  It traveled nine miles from City Hall uptown on the eastside of Manhattan across 42nd St. (today's 42nd St. Shuttle) to Times Square and proceeded uptown to 145th St. and included 28 stations. More than 150,000 riders paid a $0.05 fare on the first day of service. "", 'The original Brooklyn Manhattan Rapid Transit (BMT), today’s B, D, J, M, N, Q, R and Z lines) and Interboro Rapid Transit (IRT) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Franklin Avenue and Times Square shuttles subway systems were constructed and managed by the private sector with no government operating subsidies. Financial viability was 100 percent dependent upon farebox revenues.', 'They supported both development and economic growth of numerous neighborhoods in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens. As part of the franchise agreement the owners had to sign, City Hall had direct control over the fare structure. For a period of time, owners actually make a profit with a $0.05 fare. ', 'After two decades passed, the costs of salaries, maintenance, power, supplies and equipment would pressure owners to ask City Hall for permission to raise the fares. This additional revenue was needed to maintain a good state of repair, increase the frequency of service, purchase new subway cars, pay employee salary increases and support planned system expansion. Politicians more interested in the next reelection (and subscribing to the old Roman philosophy of free bread and circuses) refused this request each year for well over two decades. ', 'As a result, to survive, owners of both systems began looking elsewhere to reduce costs and stay in business. They started curtailing basic maintenance, delayed purchases of new subway cars, postponed salary increases for employees, canceled any plans for system expansion and cut corners to survive. In the 1930s, NYC began building and financing construction of the new Independent Subway, today’s A, C, E, F and G lines. This new municipal system subsidized by taxpayers dollars would provide direct competition to both the IRT and BMT. Municipal government forced them into economic ruin by denying them fare increases that would have provided access to additional badly needed revenues. Big Brother, just like the Godfather, eventually made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. The owners folded and sold out to City Hall.', 'In 1953, the old NYC Board of Transportation passed on control of the municipal subway system, including all its assets to the newly created NYC Transit Authority. Under late New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in the 1960s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was created. The governor appointed four board members. Likewise, the mayor appointed four more and the rest by suburban county executives. No one elected official controlled a majority of the votes. In June 1956, the A line was extended to provide new service to the Rockaways, replacing the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), which previously abandoned service on the same corridor.   ', 'Until the early 1960s, most subway stations had clean, safe, working bathrooms with toilet paper. Revenues generated from a $0.10 fee helped cover the costs.  During this time, it was common to find both penny gum and $0.10 soda machines dispensing products at many subway stations. ', 'It was a time when people respected authority and law. That generation of riders did not litter subway stations and buses leaving behind gum, candy wrappers, paper cups, bottles and newspapers. No one would openly eat pizza, chicken or other messy foods while riding a bus or subway. There was no problem with homeless people riding or occupying subway stations.', 'In December 1988 at a cost of $450 million (primarily funded with grants from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, today known as the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)), the Archer Avenue subway line was opened. Thanks to this investment, the J/Z and E lines provide direct service to both the LIRR Jamaica Station and new terminus at Archer Avenue and Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens.', 'In December 2001 at a cost of $650 million (primarily funded with grants from Washington), the 63rd St. Tunnel between Queens and Manhattan was opened. Thanks to this investment, the Queens Boulevard F line continues to provide direct service to the 6th Ave. corridor in Manhattan without having to use the old 53rd St. tunnel between Queens and Manhattan. This affords riders additional service options for those traveling from Queens to Manhattan.\n \nIn September 2015, at a cost of $2.4 billion, thanks to this investment funded by the city of New York, the Flushing #7 subway extension  from Times Square to the new Hudson Yards Station adjacent to the Javits Convention Center opened for service.\nOn Jan. 1, 2017, at a cost of $4.5 billion (funded by a FTA Capital Investments New Starts Full Funding Grant Agreement), the first Phase of Second Avenue subway was up and running from 63rd to 96th Street on the Manhattan east side.', 'In 1996, Metro Cards were introduced.  This provides free transfers between the subway and bus. It eliminated the old two fare zones, making public transportation an even better bargain. Purchasing a weekly or monthly subway/bus pass reduces the cost per ride and provides virtually unlimited trips. In many cases, employers can offer transit checks to help subsidizes a portion of the cost. Utilize this and reap the benefits. It supports a cleaner environment.', 'In 2021, MTA NYC Transit completed introducing the next generation of fare collection. It is known as One Metro New York (OMNY). Installation of this new state of the art system is now available to riders at all 471 subway stations.', 'NYC Transit has a fleet of 6,500 subway cars, with 471 stations serving 5.5 million pre COVID-19 riders. More than four million daily riders have returned. Service is provided on 28 routes spanning four of five boroughs comprising NYC, including Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan and Queens. Only the 500,000 residents of Staten Island have no direct subway connection to the rest of NYC.', 'The largest subway system in the world has benefited since the 1960s by grant funding provided by the FTA. Of the $1.8 billion in annual FTA funding provided to the MTA, NYC Transit usually receives a minimum of 70 percent or over $1.3 billion. These dollars pay for various capital improvement projects which benefit riders. ', 'Since the Urban Mass Transportation Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, NYC Transit has received billions and billions of dollars in federal assistance from Washington. This is a great example of your tax dollars at work.', 'Let us also give thanks to the thousands of hard working men and women who maintain and operate our NYC subway system. It is the life line that keeps the Big Apple moving day in and day out.', 'Larry Penner is a transportation advocate, historian and writer who previously served as a former director for the Federal Transit Administration Region 2 New York Office of Operations and Program Management. This included the development, review, approval and oversight for billions in capital projects and programs for New Jersey Transit, New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, NYC Transit bus, subway and Staten Island Railway, Long Island and Metro North railroads, MTA Bus, NYCDOT Staten Island Ferry along with 30 other transit agencies in New York and New Jersey.', 'The latest news in transit along with information and opinions from industry experts.

New Transit Museum exhibit celebrates 120 years of what the subway ‘is’,https://www.amny.com/transit/transit-museum-nyc-subway-exhibit-120-years/,"['Tackle the city, with our help.', '', '', '', 'The subway will turn 120 years old this month — and the New York Transit Museum is reflecting on what this milestone means to The Big Apple.', 'The museum in Downtown Brooklyn has launched a new exhibition, “The Subway Is…,” in honor of the subway’s birthday and intends to run it for at least a year.', 'Opened last month, the exhibit is meant to be as open-ended as the ellipsis in its title: the subway is so crucial to New York’s history, development, identity, and culture that it means many things to different people.', '', '', '“At the end of the day, New York is New York because of the subway,” said Chelsea Newburg, press officer at the Transit Museum, during a recent tour of the exhibit. “When the subway opened 120 years ago, it changed the whole city. New York did not look the way that it did before. And you can see a lot of that in the show.”', 'The first subway line opened on Oct. 27, 1904, running from City Hall to Grand Central along the present-day Lexington Avenue line (4/5/6), heading west on the current 42nd Street Shuttle line, and then moving north along the present Broadway line (1/2/3) all the way up to Harlem at 145th Street. Some 150,000 New Yorkers paid the nickel fare to ride the subway on its first day of operation.', 'The subway wasn’t New York’s first rapid transit system, of course.', 'Those were the elevated lines (Els) that crisscrossed the city starting in the 1870s, enabling the Big Apple to spread out with New Yorkers living relatively far from where they worked for the first time. Some of the original elevated system remains in service for the subway: some of the oldest stations in the system are not on the original subway line but, in fact, along the Broadway Line in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that presently serves the J and Z lines.', 'But the Els had limitations. For one, they are extremely noisy, as New Yorkers who live near elevated lines today can attest.', 'And when a massive blizzard hit the city in 1888, the elevated lines were paralyzed, helping build support for future railroads being built underground. Unlike the Els, which were built by private companies, the city would build the first subway lines — which were initially leased to private operators like the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT).', 'By today’s standards, the original subways were built fast and efficiently, but it was extremely dangerous work. Some 7,700 laborers worked on building the subway, with 16 deaths reported from construction on the original line, fewer than recorded while building the Brooklyn Bridge. Many others were grievously injured.', 'It was also incredibly complex engineering work, with labor done around existing underground utility lines carrying water, sewage, and electricity, many of which had to be re-engineered.', '', '', '“Imagine a surgeon who has to direct a probe from the neck of a patient all the way to each heel…He must not hurt a single nerve or break the wall of any vein or artery. Nerves, tendons, veins, and arteries must all be avoided, or pushed aside and protected, wherever the probe encounters them. Above all, the tranquility of the patient must not be upset,” said John B. McDonald, chief engineer of the original subway, in 1902, per the exhibit. “There, you have a fair likeness of what had to be done in digging the rapid transit tunnel.”', 'By the time the subway was completed and in service, though, New Yorkers already couldn’t live without it, and contracts were drawn up to greatly expand the system throughout Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Many of the subway lines traveled through sparsely populated regions of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and especially Queens, transforming these areas into residential and commercial hubs.', 'Even today, with seemingly every square inch of New York City occupied, a new subway line can transform a neighborhood: in just a few years, Hudson Yards has transformed from a run-down area surrounding a train yard to one of the city’s biggest high-rise residential and commercial neighborhoods, anchored by the 7 train extension completed in 2015.', 'Hundreds of miles of subway had been built by midcentury, such that many of the original elevated trains were torn down in anticipation of a replacement, most infamously the lines along Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan; planners expected them to soon be replaced by the Second Avenue Subway.', 'The exhibit describes the subway as the city’s “circulatory system,” crucial to how we get around and to how our hometown has developed, and traces how the subway has become an icon of pop culture and informed how we live our lives in New York.', 'One old advertisement, a PSA from “The Subway Sun,” puts that in stark perspective: unlike Paris, whose Métro closes at night, New York is a 24-hour town, largely because it has one of the world’s only 24 hour metro systems.', '“Paris subways close at night, New York is a 24-hour town,” said Newburg. “And that kind of goes to this idea that New York is the city that never sleeps. And the subway is what lets us live like that. It keeps us moving all the time, wherever we need to go.”', 'For the big birthday on Oct. 27, the Transit Museum will run its periodic Nostalgia Rides along the original route, using the 1917 Lo-V (short of Low Voltage) cars in its collection of old-timey rolling stock. Another ride will take place on Nov. 16.', '“The Subway Is…” is open at the New York Transit Museum at 99 Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn.', 'Post an Event', 'View All Events…', 'Find a pro']"

It now traverses over more than 600 miles of track across the five boroughs.', 'In 1904, the subway opened to the public and promised to meet the demand for rapid transit – and a lot has changed since then.', '""Prior to the evolution of the subway, you went down below ground for two reasons. You went down to get something as a miner and come back up, or you went down and you didn\'t come back up,"" said Concetta Bencivenga, director of the New York Transit Museum.', 'The idea of transporting people underground throughout the city was a concept Bencivenga says had some meteorological beginnings.', '""The reason why we have a subway at all is because there was a freak hurricane, it\'s called the Great White Hurricane of 1888. It was a blizzard. It came in in the spring and it crippled the city ... That was the sort of catalyst to say maybe going underground isn\'t such a bad idea,"" she said.', 'Following that storm, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company – also known as the IRT, a private train company – decided to take on a monumental risk in 1900.', 'Jodi Shapiro, curator of the New York Transit Museum, explains rowhouses on Park Avenue started to shift as the IRT tunneled underneath. She says engineers found ways to bore through bedrock, marble and schist.', 'Four years later, on Oct. 27, 1904, the New York City subway opened to the public.', '""That first line was parts of what is the 4/5/6 of today and the 1/2/3 of today. The original subway line went from old City Hall station up to 42nd Street. It went across Manhattan and up to 145th Street,"" Shapiro said.', 'The price to hop on board was just a nickel.', ""The IRT's success created competition from the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) in 1923 and the Independent Subway System (IND) in 1932. Two companies separately ran what we know today as the lettered lines, while the IRT ran the numbered lines."", '""The cadence of transportation history in New York City has always been about challenge and change,"" Bencivenga said.', 'In 1940, the city purchased those three companies.

', 'The cars themselves, known as ""rolling stock,"" are another makeup of the subway\'s identity, from the Standard Lo-Vs to the iconic Redbirds.', 'Designers had to keep in mind efficiency, capacity and speed.', '""The IRT, when it was opened, prided themselves on speed. You can get from City Hall to Harlem in 15 minutes,"" Shapiro said.', '""I think it\'s fair to say that when you do things in New York City, the over-under that it\'s going to become iconic is actually pretty high,"" Bencivenga said.', 'The system has now grown to include 472 stations, more than 6,000 cars, and over 800 track miles, according to the MTA.

Happy 120th birthday to the NYC Subway!

On opening day, though, 150,000 people paid a nickel to ride the subway on its first day of operation, going through 28 stations from City Hall on the modern Lexington Line, running across 42nd Street, and then heading to Harlem on the modern Broadway line.', 'The city quickly inked new contracts with private operators to build various new lines in Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Especially in Queens and parts of outer Brooklyn and the Bronx, these lines were often built through farmland that would quickly be developed for residential living. Mass transit allowed people to live further and further outside the central city and still quickly get to work in Manhattan.', '“It really was the catalyst to transform entire sections of New York, thereby expanding the footprint of where people could live in New York,” said Concetta Bencivenga, director of the New York Transit Museum. “There’s lots of competing theories as to why the five boroughs consolidated in 1898, but six years later the subway opened, and it really became possible to envision becoming what we know now as New York City.”', '', '', 'Like any other 120-year-old, the subway has experienced a lot in its lifetime. The nickel fare now costs $2.90, and the original 28 stations along 9 miles of track have grown to 472 stops across 665 miles of railroad. Those first 150,000 riders gave way to a peak of over 6 million before the pandemic, and ridership is still usually over 4 million on an average weekday now.', 'While the city has always owned its subway, its operation has changed hands several times, from a slew of private companies to the city to finally the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which was formed in 1968 to pool revenue from transit fares and auto tolls — and neatly disempower Robert Moses, the New York “master builder” who favored highways and auto infrastructure at the expense of mass transit.', 'Today, the MTA runs the subway, buses, Metro-North, Long Island Rail Road, Access-a-Ride, and various bridges and tunnels.', '', '', 'Meanwhile, the subway has gone through periods of great expansion and significant contraction: hundreds of miles of new lines have been built since Day 1, but on the flipside, many of the old elevated lines were torn down without being effectively replaced by a subway, most infamously along Second and Third avenues in Manhattan.', 'The subway has faced significant financial pressures that have led to deterioration in service and the physical environment, especially during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s and the “Summer of Hell” in the 2010s.', 'Today, the MTA says it needs $68 billion to properly invest in maintaining the system in a “state of good repair ” and replacing many dated infrastructure components, such as Great Depression-era train signals and railcars over 50 years old. It is yet unclear if the agency will actually get anywhere close to that sum.', '“Looking at the history, you can only honor where we are today,” said Crichlow. “But it also talks about how we need to continue to fund the system, due to the capital work necessary to keep the system going. It’s 120 years, I don’t know many people who maintain anything that’s 100 years old. So it does require a certain level of care, but it also speaks to how we’re able to maintain it, how good a job we do of maintaining it to provide service daily the way that we do.”', 'Through it all, though, the subway has been the circulatory system of New York City, crucial not just to the economic might of New York but also to its cultural dominance in America and the world.', 'To celebrate the occasion, on Sunday the Transit Museum hosted two of its periodic “nostalgia rides” on rolling stock from its collection of old-timey trains.', '', '', 'Approximately 500 lucky railfans packed onto the two separate rides from the old South Ferry terminal to Harlem on the Broadway line and back to the old City Hall station on the Lexington line using the Standard Lo-V (short for Low Voltage), which dates to 1917 and was notable for requiring much less electricity to run than previous models. Two more sold-out rides are scheduled for Nov. 16.', 'The Lo-Vs were in service for decades. One rider, Dennis McDonald of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, recalled riding them to high school as late as 1964, when a subway fare cost 15 cents. Others didn’t quite recall the Lo-Vs but nonetheless found the train trip to be a journey down memory lane.', '“Growing up in Queens, taking the subway every day to high school, I always had an affinity for the subway,” said Long Island resident Tom Quinn. “I was always fascinated by it. It just takes me back to my youth riding these old trains.”', 'Younger railfans compared them to the newer rolling stock they’ve become accustomed to.', '“It’s a pretty cool train,” said Manhattan resident Michael Rochester. “It’s nice to compare them to the ones we have today, like the R211, R142, and it’s nice to see how the MTA originally came from.”', 'Riders weren’t the only ones marveling at the history of it all.
