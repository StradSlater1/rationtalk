2025 Audi RS 3 First Drive: More Hairpins!,https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2025-audi-rs-3-first-drive-review.html,"[""The 2025 Audi RS 3 is just a delightful little car. Pop into its compact cabin, grip its squircle of a steering wheel and fire up its uniquely snarling turbocharged five-cylinder engine. You won't need to go far in order to appreciate how everything feels light, controllable and small — oh so delightfully small."", 'So many modern performance cars require engineering miracles to overcome crushing weight or vast dimensions. Descriptions of ""it drives smaller than it is"" and ""it defies the laws of physics"" get thrown about to compensate. It\'s like seeing a sumo wrestler compete on American Ninja Warrior. Impressive — for what it is.', '', 'The RS 3 isn\'t compensating for enlarged dimensions, an SUV body style or EV battery weight; it\'s a small sedan that feels like a small sedan. When you increase the pace, the RS 3 whips itself around corners with the exuberance and tenacity of a post-bath dog on thick-pile carpet. ""More hairpins! More hairpins!"" It might as well be barking.', ""OK, so actually it was me shouting that while slicing the 2025 RS 3 through the beautiful winding roads surrounding Montserrat, an awe-inspiring landmark outside Barcelona, Spain, that looks like someone replaced the faces on Mount Rushmore with the wind-smoothed peaks of Arches National Park. One stretch of road in particular delivered those hairpins in abundance, showcasing the new RS 3's sharper reflexes, eager rotation and resolute ability to go exactly where you want it to go."", ""The RS 3's improvements are not the result of new hardware. The 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-five still produces 401 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The transmission shifts a bit quicker but is ultimately the same seven-speed dual-clutch automatic as before."", '', ""Then there's the all-wheel-drive system, which still has its unique Torque Splitter rear differential with a clutch at each wheel that can individually engage. The result is called torque vectoring, or the tank-like ability to turn by moving the outside wheel faster than the inside one. On top of that, the RS 3 uses brake-based torque vectoring at each wheel, whereby the brakes are used to slow the inside wheels. Basically, you get double the torque-vectoring fun."", 'So what makes the 2025 RS 3 better than its predecessor? Audi\'s engineers improved the communication and synchronization between these two torque-vectoring systems, plus the stability control and adaptive dampers. The ""further-developed algorithm,"" as Audi describes it, allows the driver to ""accelerate the RS 3 sooner and steer it through the bend at higher speeds.""', ""To achieve such high speeds, Audi let me loose on the Circuit Parcmotor Castellolí, a roller coaster of a little track tucked into a wooded valley. The RS 3's turbo inline-five felt a bit sleepy at first, but once I hit 4,000 rpm, a bomb went off under the hood. Speed built with exuberance from there, accompanied by a riot of angry noises unique to this bizarro engine."", '', ""Once again, though, it's the RS 3's cornering that was most impressive. I'd hit the easily modulated brakes, turn into the corner and the car would bite hard as the brake-based torque vectoring did its job eliminating understeer. I'd get back on the gas mid-corner, and both systems would get to work, eagerly rotating the back end around, encouraging more and more throttle usage with every lap. The steering was feelsome and not burdened with excessive weighting, making it easy to maintain the desired cornering angle through both squircle and throttle inputs."", ""Sadly, an outgoing RS 3 was not on hand in Spain to feel the new car's changes back to back. But for context, the 2025 RS 3 sliced a whopping 7 seconds off its predecessor's best lap time at the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife. Same driver, similar conditions. That's quite the algorithm."", ""Visual differences between old and new RS 3s are hard to notice; the front fascia remains an expanse of gloss-black plastic. There are even fewer painted bits now, the grille is a slightly edgier hexagon shape, the mesh pattern within is different and the LED running lights are reshaped. (The latter even features four driver-selectable design patterns.) The Audi logo has also been raised a bit and its contrast gray finish makes it look less like someone pried off your RS 3's chrome rings. Changes at the rear are even harder to spot (the taillights are a little tweaked), but you can't miss those hot new 19-inch cross-spoke wheels."", '', ""The interior's design is unchanged, but there are new dash trim options and a checkered-flag-like backlit pattern in the doors. The center console has been slightly reworked with a reshaped phone-holding storage bin and a flatter gloss-black shift toggle that looks and feels cheaper than the one it replaces. Its placement just seems like a waste of space."", ""The new squircle steering wheel design is the most obvious update, and it didn't earn any fans among the assembled journalists at the RS 3 drive event in Spain. Those, such as myself, who shuffle steer around tight corners were particularly aggrieved by the flat top and bottom. For a car that loves hairpins, this issue was exasperated. It seems like the shape was chosen to match the contour of the instrument cowl, which is just silly. On the other hand, the two red buttons under the spokes that select the RS 3's special Performance and Individual drive modes were universally appreciated."", ""I didn't get a chance to sample the RS 3's standard seats, as all of Audi's test cars featured optional sport buckets that won't be coming to the United States. The back seat remains tight, especially in terms of headroom. At 6 feet, 3 inches tall, I could just barely squeeze my legs behind my far-flung seating position, but it was headroom that was surprisingly the bigger issue, as I had to crane my neck in order to fit. There was no issue sitting up front with a helmet on, though. The trunk remains a tiny 8.3 cubic feet."", '', ""Yes, the RS 3's interior is small, but that's the point. It's hard to complain about the ballooning size and weight of a BMW M3, for instance, then turn around and gripe about the rear seat of the RS 3. It's perfectly serviceable and I'd rather sit back there than in the back of a Mercedes-AMG CLA 45. The RS 3's four doors also make it more practical than the two-door BMW M2."", ""Pricing is not available at the time of this writing, but those two competitors cost a couple thousand dollars more than the RS 3 last year. The RS 3 is more desirable and more comfortable than the comparably powerful CLA 45, and Edmunds has called out the M2 as one of those performance cars that lost a step after growing bigger and heavier with its latest generation. That's not the case with the 2025 RS 3."", 'James Riswick has been testing cars and writing about them for more than 20 years. He was the senior reviews editor for Autoblog and previously served multiple editor roles here at Edmunds. He has also contributed to Autotrader, Car and Driver, Hagerty, JD Power and Autoguide Magazine.

2025 Audi RS3 First Drive Review: Unadulterated Fun,https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-audi-rs3-first-drive-review,"['JERRY PEREZ', 'Posted On Oct 27, 2024 7:01 PM EDT', 'JERRY PEREZ', 'The phrase “become one with the car” is so overused in car reviews that I’ve always avoided using it on one of my own. While somewhat romantic, it’s a lazy way of summing up several thoughts and emotions into a catchy phrase worthy of a magazine cover or marketing slogan. Yet here I am, using it to describe a highly-regarded car that I, until now, have remained skeptical about. The 2025 Audi RS3 is a fun-loving sedan with chops so impeccable you’ll feel like you’ve… become one with the car.', 'If you’re rolling your eyes at this hypocrisy and ready to click away from this page, skip to the juicy driving portion of this review before doing so. Perhaps you’ll realize there’s some truth to that cheesy cliche—a truth that might send you straight into an Audi dealership ready to sign some paperwork.', 'Marking a mid-cycle refresh for its third generation, there’s plenty to love about the refreshed 2025 RS3. There are new bumpers up front and out back—each more aggressively styled—a sportier hexagonal grille, digital OLED taillights, and digital daytime running lights whose digital light signatures can be customized. Newly developed, extra-grippy Pirelli P Zero R 245/35 R19 tires wrap around 19-inch, aluminum cast 10-spoke wheels while massive exhaust pipes out back look borrowed from the defunct R8 supercar.', 'Not everything is new, however, and that’s a good thing. The 2.5-liter turbo five-cylinder engine and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission combo that everyone loves remains, and so do the clever torque-splitting rear differential, adaptive dampers, and Quattro all-wheel drive. Another trait that remains is the RS3’s mighty attitude, which now carries on inside with new mood lighting and an RS-specific red theme. A new, super rad steering wheel that’s flat at the top and the bottom serves as the cabin’s focal point—looking a bit like one from a Pikes Peak rally car. It’s great to look at and even better to touch, much like the carbon-backed seats—though sadly Audi confirmed those buckets are for Europe only. Womp womp.', 'Lastly, Audi hasn’t released final specs for the States-bound 2025 RS3 yet, but the 2024 sold here pumped out 401 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The Euro-spec car I drove here was rated at 396 hp.', 'During the presentation, one of Audi’s engineers brought up a slide displaying the trajectory of the outgoing RS3 through a corner, showing the car at the corner entry, apex, and corner exit. It showed the torque-splitter differential and Quattro’s behavior through each of these steps—highlighting how each system helped the car stay on course and nail the apex. Then, a new layer was added to the slide, showing the new 2025 RS3’s path. The juxtaposition of old and new claimed that the 2025 model could more accurately attack the same corner at a considerably higher speed but without losing its composure. In other words, it can go through corners faster without understeering.', 'According to the engineer, the difference wasn’t minimal either, and he claimed that we’d be able to feel the new software tweaks on the track the next day. While this sounded promising, these differences didn’t mean much to me given that I had never driven the previous car. ', 'Skip to the part where I’m flying through a corner at 90 mph and snaking through a chicane at 60-plus. “Oh shit,” I said a few times throughout the first couple of laps of Castellolí. My mind kept on going back to those graphics from the previous night’s presentation. By this point, I had already spent about two hours driving and riding in the RS3 on public roads, but the track unlocked the RS3’s magic. And boy, was it magical.', 'Audi clearly wanted to highlight the car’s maneuverability because the track’s slowest corner was a banked hairpin taken at about 50 mph, which then opened up to an extremely fast series of sweepers. Through every single one of them, the RS3 felt at ease carrying loads of speed while gently shifting its weight from one side to another, letting its dampers do their job. Through these bends, the car needed minimal steering input to make it dance, and to the slideshow’s point, it was more about guiding the car with the accelerator by modulating the amount of power sent to the axles. The combination of phenomenal steering, sticky Pirellis, and some of the most advanced differentials on any car made today delivered exactly what that slideshow had promised me.', 'Going into a corner, the RS3 felt light on its feet and tossable, and its reactions were so quick that I spent the first few minutes reconsidering my turn-in point at each corner. Realizing that I could brake later and turn in more aggressively, I simply adjusted how much speed I carried through corners—and it was considerably higher than I’d feel comfortable with in most other cars. Also, my first-ever laps on that track were in the bigger and heavier RSQ8, which provided my brain with a baseline that the RS3 shattered with ease. ', 'By the end of the second lap, I began nailing apexes just like the smart German said the car could do. “Point and shoot,” I kept thinking. “It’s easy to go fast and feel like a racing driver.” And much like Patches O’Houlihan said in Dodgeball: “If you can see the apex, you can nail it.” Fine, what he actually said was, “If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball,” but you get the point. Granted, if you’re doing something completely stupid with your speed or positioning through a corner, chances are, you won’t nail it. But the RS3 is so tactile and lovable that it may just let you get away with it.', 'A couple of sectors required rotating the car very quickly to align for the next corner after, and this would happen while I was coming in cookin’ from the previous one. Depending on how smoothly I could do this, the RS3 would feel super solid or give me a little shake at the rear to remind me that I need to do better. I experienced the latter a couple of times until I tweaked my entry and fine-tuned my braking point. Turning into the apex and exiting the corner with your foot all the way down gives you an insight into the kind of split-second decisions the car is making in regard to power, torque, and traction—and it’s loads of fun. Getting ambitious with the right foot on corner exit will kick the back end just enough to make you feel like a hero but not so much that you freak out; though that depends on how easily you freak out, I suppose.', 'Audi’s carbon ceramic brakes do the slowing down thing with ease, never showing any fade throughout my time on the track. There were two especially heavy braking zones at Castellolí: Turn 1 and a temporary chicane Audi installed to keep speeds reasonable on the back straight. The former involved braking from about 120 mph to 70-ish, while the latter was more intense—probably something like 120 to about 60 mph. You could really feel physics at work in those two instances, with the weight of the car becoming more noticeable there than anywhere else on the track. It took a couple of laps to get used to my heavy butt slightly levitating off the seat each time I came through there, and I can confirm the seatbelts work flawlessly.', 'Away from the track, and on the narrow and twisty roads around Montserrat, the RS3 felt at home carving hairpins, dancing around switchbacks, and blasting its throaty tune through tunnels. The most noticeable characteristic of the RS3 on the street was its adaptive suspension. I never found a mode that I was truly happy with, as Comfort mode made the ride a bit too bouncy at times, and switching to Dynamic or RS made it too stiff.', 'On the highway, the RS3 felt relaxed and nothing—and I mean nothing—led me to believe that the small-ish sedan was capable of doing such naughty things on the track. The cabin was quiet, steering was firm and quick, but not overly heavy or darty. As I mentioned before, the cars I tested were all Euro spec, so the seats and other bits you see in the photos may not transfer over to the eventual American-spec cars.', 'The RS3 quickly jumped to the top of my list of favorite cars; but more importantly, it also now lives on the list of cars I would actually buy with my own money. My all-time favorite car happens to be a hatchback that shares a lot in common with the RS3 in terms of provenance, characteristics, attitude, and best of all: bang for the buck.', 'There were very few scenarios in which the 2025 Audi RS3 disappointed me, passing most tests with flying colors. Although, I would like more seat time to really explore its on-street character. Ignore the spec sheet and perhaps even ignore this review, and much like the Honda Civic Type R, this is one of those cars that you have to drive—and drive hard—to understand, and subsequently, fall in love with. Oh geez, I just told you what my favorite car is.', 'On paper, the RS3 may seem like a lot of money for the ‘roided-up version of a compact Audi, but it’s so much more than that.

Audi's 5-Cylinder Flyer Gets Sharper for 2025,https://www.aol.com/audis-5-cylinder-flyer-gets-220100836.html,"['Advertisement', '', '', 'The Audi RS3 is a bit of an oddball. It has 401 hp under the hood, a serious number for a car weighing around 3600 pounds. But that power comes from the last five-cylinder engine on the market, making it an internal-combustion unicorn. Plus it has wider tires in front than rear, and a torque-splitting differential on the back axle. The kind of stuff car nerds love to geek out about, the automotive equivalent of Dad Rock.', 'For 2025 the RS3 gets a mild facelift and new tuning for the chassis, including the active differential. Audi says the tweaks help the car to coordinate its responses for more agile, confident cornering and power delivery. Despite no changes to the actual powertrain hardware, and using the same size option Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires, the new RS3 set a Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time of 7 minutes, 33 seconds—more than seven seconds quicker than the pre-facelift version and a new record in the compact segment.', 'Our expert editors test every vehicle we review. Read more about how we test and review cars here.', ""The RS3 is the highest-performance version of Audi's A3, which shares an underlying platform with the Volkswagen Golf. Other markets get a hatchback variant, but the RS3 will only come as a sedan in the United States. The turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five engine makes 401 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque in U.S.-spec. Power is routed through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic to an all-wheel-drive system with an even torque split between the two axles and a torque-vectoring rear differential that can send all of the rear axle effort to one side or the other."", 'Vehicle Tested: 2025 Audi RS3', 'Base Price: $63,000 (est)', 'Location: Barcelona, Spain', 'Engine: 2480cc turbocharged inline-five', 'Power: 401 hp @ 7000 rpm', 'Torque: 369 lb-ft @ 2250 rpm', '0-62 mph: 3.8-sec', 'Transmission: Seven-speed dual clutch, all-wheel drive', 'Weight: 3600 pounds (est)', 'EPA MPG: 19 / 29 / 23 (City / Highway / Combined)', 'The character of the RS3 depends somewhat on the selectable drive mode. Leave it in Comfort or Auto, and you might forget that it can sprint from 0 to 60 in under four seconds. Switch to Dynamic, and the burble of the five-cylinder becomes louder both inside and outside the car, and the ride on the active dampers firms up accordingly.', ""While it's nifty that these modes make a substantive difference in the way the RS3 drives, their magic is layered on top of an underlying goodness. The same was true of the pre-facelift RS3, but now the car is more responsive. European data security laws necessitated an update to some of the onboard computers, and Audi engineers took the opportunity refine the algorithms between the rear differential, brakes, and electronic stability program. So we should thank bureaucracy for the sharpened dynamic experience."", ""Audi's RS badge always means something a little extra, and the highlight of the RS3 has to be the five-cylinder and the wholly unique burble it creates. It's easy to say there's nothing else like this on the market because, well, there isn't. Audi's steadfast commitment to an engine configuration the rest of the world has dismissed is charming enough, but it also moves. While 401 hp, oddly, seems relatively tame today, it is assuredly not so in the RS3, where flooring the accelerator leads to a rush of speed with only the slightest hint of turbo lag. The seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox is paired well to engine, rarely caught out in a high gear and quick to downshift in the auto-shifting modes."", 'Both on mountain roads outside of Barcelona and lapping the 2.5-mile Circuit Parcmotor Castellolí, the RS3 has a supernatural cornering ability. The rear differential powers the outside wheel as needed, along with imperceptible application of the inside rear brake to further aid rotation. Together, this all but eliminates understeer.', ""On the track, in the RS Performance mode with the engine, transmission, and chassis in their most aggressive settings, the RS3 carried astonishing speed through sweeping corners. Torque vectoring adds a feeling of rear-drive dynamics to the stability of all-wheel drive—in other words, modulating the RS3's cornering attitude using the throttle. I didn't get the chance to play with the drift-friendly RS Torque Rear mode, but even without selecting that there is no shortage of entertainment from behind the wheel."", ""The underlying MQB Evo platform of the RS3 is already solid. Don't let the fact that it shares many parts and components with the Golf dissuade you. Much like the Performance Car of the Year–winning Acura Integra Type S, which is related to the Honda Civic, the family connection doesn't diminish the increased refinement that comes with the luxury brand. Extra touches like backlit door panel trim and faux suede on some of the dashboard panels help elevate the Audi from its people's car cousin."", ""Inside, the RS3 is comfortable and spacious. There's plenty of room for four adults, and trunk space is more than adequate. It's a reminder that what is still considered compact in our inflated-dimensions world is still plenty large, while the smaller footprint also makes it handy on the road."", ""My test car had optional European-spec carbon bucket seats that won't make it to our side of the Atlantic, a shame as they offered a near-perfect combination of support and comfort. The rest of the interior works well, with the angular theme carried through the dashboard and door panel trim in a coherent, but not overly styled, way."", 'The new steering wheel features an RS button along with one in a checkered flag pattern, offering shortcuts to customized and performance dynamic modes, respectively. They worked great. But what was less charming is the strangely squared-off shape of the wheel itself, matching the curve of the instrument cluster shroud but feeling weird whenever I touched a corner during shuffle-steering maneuvers. Steering wheels should be round.', ""We don't have U.S. pricing yet, but we assume the facelifted RS3 will stick close to last year's model, starting around $65,000. You'll get nearly as much performance at a much lower price point with the Audi S3—which has recently been upgraded with the same torque-biasing rear differential—or even the VW Golf R. On paper, the RS3 lines up well against the Integra Type S, BMW M235i Gran Coupe, and Mercedes CLA45. And, of course, none of its rivals can offer the novelty of that charismatic five-cylinder engine."", ""Where the RS3 delivers is in its versatility. The front-wheel-drive architecture means there's less compromise in rear-seat space and plenty of trunk room. It's perfectly suited to daily use and the occasional track day or weekend driving excursion."", 'Magic cornering abilities.', 'Unmistakeable five-cylinder burble.', 'Everyday practicality.', '""Squircle"" steering wheel.', 'Plasticky-feeling shift paddles.', 'Only 23 mpg combined.', ""The new 10-spoke wheels are stunning, but the checkered-flag daytime running light pattern is what made me smile the most, aside from the thrills from behind the wheel. The taillights also show a similar patten, and it's exclusive to the RS3. It's a subtle cue that this is something more than the A3 or S3 without being overt or flashy.

Thanks to these finely dosed braking interventions, the RS 312 follows the curve radius more precisely than before and is positioned earlier and better at the apex of the curve. This allows the driver to accelerate sooner and achieve a higher speed at the exit of the bend.', '', 'The technical background\nThis earlier and more controlled agility is made possible by an improved algorithm that enables the chassis control systems to communicate with each other more precisely. The two control units of the torque splitter, the electronic stabilization control, the brake torque vectoring (i.e. the wheel-selective torque control), and the adaptive dampers of the RS sport suspension react even more sensitively to the respective driving situation – always depending on the selected Audi drive select mode. The interaction of these systems also ensures increased stability, for example in wet or snowy conditions.', 'If you wish to receive our regular update on the topics we feature, you can subscribe for our newsletter.', 'You have questions about Audi and our products?
