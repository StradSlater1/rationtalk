SpaceX is NASA’s biggest lunar rival,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-is-nasa-s-biggest-lunar-rival-101729347393883.html,"['', 'It was something amazing—an expensive, delicate ship falling out of the sky with such precision that it could be caught in a waiting pair of giant, gentle arms. If you wanted an illustration of the fact that Americans can do things in space beyond the reach of other earthlings the return of the booster stage of SpaceX’s fifth Starship test flight on October 13th could hardly be bettered.', '', 'It is a far cry from the days when America first kindled spacefaring fire in its belly. When, in May 1961, John F. Kennedy presented Congress with the goal of putting “a man on the Moon by the end of the decade” America seemed to be clearly lagging behind the Soviet Union; it would not put its first astronaut into orbit until the following year. But Kennedy’s advisers had chosen their target in the knowledge that the technology needed to go to the Moon was of a different order from that needed just to get into orbit. The USSR’s prowess in the latter was little help to it in the former. America consequently beat them to it, developing the mighty Saturn V rocket and the Apollo spacecraft which sat on top of it remarkably quickly.', 'Today America has not one, but two rockets which have more power at lift-off than the Saturn V: SpaceX’s Starship and the Space Launch System (SLS) developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Thus equipped, it might seem that getting Americans back to the Moon, as the agency was told to do by then-vice-president Mike Pence five years ago, should be a doddle.', 'Yet the Artemis programme, named after Apollo’s sister, has yet to see a crewed flight (the picture, above, is from its first and only uncrewed flight). NASA’s claim that its third flight, Artemis III, could see an American woman set foot somewhere near the Moon’s south pole, its primary target, in 2026 sits in the area where optimism is increasingly blurring into deceit. Some internal NASA documents make 2028 look more likely; outside observers, including some former insiders, talk of later still.', 'NASA programmes have a costly habit of being long drawn out; without competition, there is little to focus the mind. On the lunar front, though, there is clear competition. China has plans to fly its own astronauts to the Moon by 2030, and many Americans have a neuralgic reaction to the idea that America’s current geopolitical rival might put people on the Moon before America manages to return them there. Some fear it would look like a re-run of the space race of the 1960s, but one in which America loses, thereby demonstrating some terrible decline.', 'That would be the wrong conclusion to draw; America’s technological lead in space is broad enough that to be pipped to the post in one symbolically loaded (though scientifically unimportant) venture would not demonstrate all that much. But symbolism matters. NASA officials play down the very idea that they are in a race with China. ”We’ve already been to the Moon, [so] we already beat China to the Moon,” says Cathy Koerner, associate administrator in the agency’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. But if a day comes when a five-starred red flag hangs at the south pole of the Moon with no stars and stripes nearby, it will be a bad day to be NASA administrator, and a tense one on which to be president.', 'In a way, though, the more fundamental rival is SpaceX. Over the past ten years, NASA has started to move away from the time-honoured model which sees it tell private industry exactly what it wants built and then pay the price, with a handsome guaranteed profit added on. Instead, NASA tells companies what it wants done; lets them say how they would do it, how much new stuff they will have to develop and what that will all cost; and then offers fixed-price contracts to the best bids. The enlightened goal is to build up a thriving competitive market in such services.', 'The result has been the building up of SpaceX. The contracts the company won for delivering cargo and crews to the International Space Station (ISS) were fundamental to the development of its Falcon 9 rocket (which among many other things currently launches all the cargo destined for the ISS) and its Dragon space capsule.', 'In some ways this worked well for NASA; one internal study found that developing the space-station resupply capability in-house would have cost NASA $4bn, rather than the $300m SpaceX has charged. But the competitive market hardly appeared. The rockets which were used by the only alternative cargo supplier have been discontinued. Boeing’s attempt to build a capsule to compete with Dragon has been a costly and embarrassing flop.', 'SpaceX is not a contractor like others NASA is used to. It does not know its place. It did not just develop the Falcon 9: it made it reusable, which NASA would never have dreamed of doing. And it has real plans to do things once reserved for national programmes. Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, says he wants to send uncrewed Starships to Mars within a few years, and crewed ones soon after. Those plans far outstrip NASA’s.', 'The supporting-player-turned-star dynamic is clearly visible in the needless complexity of the Artemis programme. Moon programmes, be they American or Chinese, named after male gods or female ones, all have two things in common: a crew capsule for getting people from the Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and back; and a lunar lander that takes people from that capsule down to the surface and back.', 'The genius of the Saturn V was that it was sized to carry a smallish capsule and lander all in one flight. A model unveiled in February 2024 suggests that China is planning two launches. One Long March 10 rocket (a souped-up version of the already operational Long March 5) puts a single astronaut into orbit around the Moon in a capsule called Mengzhou, (“Boat of dreams”). A second Long March 10 then sends the lander Lanyue (“Embracing the Moon”), to the surface of the Moon with two more people on board. They spend six hours doing science, taking selfies and raising flags before a part of the lander takes them up to dock with Mengzhou. Then all three astronauts head back to Earth (see graphic).', 'With Artemis, things are more complex, because NASA is using hardware not specifically designed for the task: a capsule, Orion, which Lockheed has been working on since the 2000s, and the rocket meant to launch it, the SLS which Boeing and others have been working on since the 2010s. Both programmes have gone well over schedule, and cost more than $20bn each, though, thanks to a mixture of politics (big space programmes have strong support from politicians from states where the money is spent) and the sunk-cost fallacy, they are what Artemis must use.', 'Unfortunately, Orion is quite a large capsule, and though SLS can produce tremendous power at launch, it is less effective thereafter. This means that the SLS as currently configured cannot put Orion into the sort of low orbit around the Moon that Apollo used and China is planning. Instead, Artemis mission plans have Orion loitering in the Moon’s vicinity in a highly elongated “near-rectilinear halo orbit” (NRHO). The good thing about an NRHO is that you can get an Orion into one using an SLS. The bad thing is that getting down to the Moon from one requires considerably more oomph than getting down from a low orbit. So does getting back up.', 'The SLS cannot deliver a lander capable of such things to the halo orbit chosen for Orion. So NASA put the problem of making up for the deficiencies of its plan out to tender. It asked the industry for a “Human Landing System” (HLS) which could get from Earth to the halo orbit, down to the Moon and back up again. The winning bid was SpaceX’s offer of a modified Starship.', 'The HLS starship will take the same approach to the Moon as Mr Musk wants to take to Mars. First, SpaceX launched a Starship modified to serve as a propellant depot. This will sit in low-Earth orbit where yet more Starship launches, perhaps a dozen or so, will fill it up. Then another Starship will take off and fill up its tanks. Fully fuelled, Starship has enough oomph for a one-way mission to Mars—or, alternatively, for a trip to a lunar NRHO, then on to the surface of the Moon and back up to the waiting Orion (see graphic).', 'The only reason anyone has for thinking such a scheme might work is that SpaceX has a truly remarkable record in terms of engineering. It is not hard to believe that the company will, in time, build a fleet of Starships which are fully reusable. Transferring large amounts of propellant between craft in orbit is a new challenge, but surely not an unmeetable one. And the company has already developed one life-support system, for Dragon: there is no reason it should not, in time, develop a second capable of keeping the Moonwalkers on the Starship HLS alive for the duration of their flight and lunar sojourn.', 'The idea that this will all be done in the next couple of years, though, stretches credulity. In “Reentry”, his recent book about SpaceX, Eric Berger, a journalist, talks about what the engineers there call Mr Musk’s “green lights to Malibu” approach to timelines. In principle, if every light is green and if you drive at 15 miles per hour over the speed limit, you could get from the company’s former headquarters in Hawthorne to Malibu in under half an hour. But because that never happens, you cannot. The first flights of the crewed version of the Dragon, of the Falcon Heavy and of the Starship all took place years after Mr Musk had said they would. Having the Starship HLS ready to take part in Artemis III in 2026, as NASA claims may happen, is the green light to Malibu and back over and over again.', 'When it finally happens, though, SpaceX will have versions of Starship tailored for Mars ready, too; the Mars-bound version just has to combine the landing-vertically-on-its-own legs capability needed for the HLS with the thermal protection already needed by the everyday version of Starship (to shield it from the heat generated by passage through a planetary atmosphere). Once Mr Musk has a Mars-capable Starship he will use it at the first opportunity. So by the time SpaceX has completed an uncrewed dry run of an Artemis landing there is every chance that it will also have sent a number of uncrewed Starships off to Mars. The odds are even better that this will impress people more. With good reason: SpaceX will be showing it can do things NASA pretty much can’t.', 'For America and for Mr Musk, to the extent that their interests align, that looks great. For NASA it does not. In the 1960s landing on the Moon was not an end in itself. It was the means to something else: a challenge, in Kennedy’s words, “to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills”. The engineers at SpaceX demonstrate America still has remarkable energies and skills; NASA’s Artemis programme is neither organising them well nor discovering the best they can offer.', 'Curious about the world?

Mechanical arms on a specially built launch tower, dubbed “Mechazilla,” then closed around the 233-foot-tall rocket, catching it in mid-air so that it could be refurbished and flown again.', 'The kicker? This was the first time SpaceX — or anyone else — had attempted this kind of rocket recovery, and its success astonished even the company’s own employees.', '“This is absolutely insane!” said Kate Tice, SpaceX manager of Quality Systems Engineering, during a livestream of the event. “On the first-ever attempt, we have successfully caught the Super Heavy booster back at the launch tower…This is a day for the engineering history books.”', 'Since its founding 22 years ago, SpaceX has proven time and again that a private aerospace company can not only match the accomplishments of government-funded space agencies, but in many cases, do more than they can, faster, and at a lower cost.', 'In honor of SpaceX’s remarkable Super Heavy snag, this month’s T-Minus is taking a look back at 10 major milestones in the commercial space industry — including several other SpaceX triumphs.', 'NASA and other space agencies regularly worked with private companies throughout the early decades of the space era, but Northrop Grumman and Orbital Sciences Corporation proved with the successful maiden launch of Pegasus on April 5, 1990, that private companies could develop and build rockets all on their own.', 'Pegasus was a solid-fuel, air-launched rocket. Once released from a carrier aircraft at an altitude of about 40,000 feet, it would ignite its stages one by one until it reached orbit. The final Pegasus flight took place in 1994, but a larger configuration of the rocket, Pegasus XL, was in use until 2021, deploying payloads for NASA and other customers.', 'In 1996, the X Prize Foundation announced it would award $10 million to the first non-governmental organization that could fly a reusable crewed spacecraft into space twice in two weeks. ', 'California-based aerospace company Scaled Composites set out to win the prize, and on June 21, 2004, pilot Mike Melvill flew its air-launched SpaceShipOne spacecraft just above the Karman line — the boundary separating Earth’s atmosphere and outer space.', 'This made SpaceShipOne the first private crewed spacecraft to reach space, and by the fall of 2004, Scaled Composites would fly the spacecraft twice in five days to earn the X Prize.', 'In 2002, Elon Musk used about half of the $176 million he made from the sale of PayPal to found SpaceX with the dream of building rockets that could slash the cost of spaceflight and, eventually, put people on Mars. ', 'Six years later, the startup was on the brink of bankruptcy — it had attempted to launch its first rocket, Falcon 1, three times, and all three ended in failure. ', 'On September 28, 2008, SpaceX tried again, and this time, Falcon 1 reached space, saving the startup and putting SpaceX in the history books as the first private company to make it to orbit with a fully liquid-fueled rocket.', 'The successful launch of Falcon 1 helped SpaceX secure a $1.6 billion contract from NASA, and after flying a Falcon 1 one more time, the startup turned its attention to developing an orbital rocket with a booster that could be recovered and reused after launch — something that had never been done before, but that could dramatically lower the cost of spaceflight.', 'SpaceX successfully flew this rocket, the Falcon 9, for the first time in 2010, but it wouldn’t start testing its landing system until 2013. Then, on December 21, 2015, following the 20th flight of a Falcon 9, SpaceX successfully guided the booster to a vertical landing — ushering in a new era in more affordable spaceflight. ', 'Soon after the Falcon 9 started flying, SpaceX began using the rocket and its reusable Dragon 1 spacecraft to ferry cargo to and from the International Space Station (ISS) for NASA — something no private company had done before. ', 'On May 31, 2020, SpaceX hit an even bigger milestone in commercial spaceflight when its Crew Dragon spacecraft delivered two astronauts to the ISS. ', 'This was the first time a private company had ever carried people to the ISS, and it marked the first crewed spaceflight from US soil since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 — ending NASA’s nearly decade-long reliance on Russia for ISS transportation.', 'In 2001, US businessman Dennis Tito paid an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride to the ISS aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with trained cosmonauts, making him the world’s first space tourist. Over the next decade, six others would reach space in the same way.', 'It wasn’t until September 2021’s Inspiration4 mission, though, that we’d see a crew composed solely of private citizens travel to Earth’s orbit, where they’d spend about three days before splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.', 'The crew made this journey aboard one of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsules, launched by a Falcon 9 rocket, making it the first entirely private orbital spaceflight. ', 'Less than seven months after Inspiration4, SpaceX facilitated another first for the commercial space industry by transporting a crew of four private citizens to the ISS for Axiom Space’s Axiom Mission 1.', 'The trip was once again made possible by a Crew Dragon capsule and a Falcon 9 rocket, and during their 16 days aboard the ISS, the crew conducted more than two dozen research experiments in the orbiting laboratory.', '“The success of this first private astronaut mission to the International Space Station is an important step in opening opportunities for space travelers and achieving NASA’s goal of enabling commercial business off the planet in low-Earth orbit,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson afterward.', 'In 1959, the Soviet space program’s Luna 2 became the first human-made object to hit the moon’s surface (don’t call it “landing,” though). In the decades that followed, more than 30 spacecraft — all built by public space agencies — would land on the moon. Nine would even have astronauts on board.', 'On February 22, 2024, Texas-based space startup Intuitive Machines became the first private company to soft land on the moon, successfully guiding one of its Nova-C lunar landers to the lunar surface (with a little last-minute help from an onboard experiment).', 'Intuitive Machines plans to return to the moon again in January 2025, this time with NASA’s water-mining PRIME-1 experiment onboard its lander. If that mission is a success, it could help NASA return people to the moon — and, eventually, put boots on Mars. ', 'In 2005, before SpaceX had even successfully flown Falcon 1, Musk was already talking about building the BFR, a “big f*cking rocket” that could put 100 tons of payload in low-Earth orbit and, eventually, transport cargo and people to Mars.', 'Several name changes later, SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket was finally ready for test flights in 2022. It took four tries, but on June 6, 2024, SpaceX managed to put Starship into orbit and then bring it back to Earth with a controlled reentry, ending with a soft landing in the Indian Ocean — putting humanity a step closer to crewed Mars missions.', 'Almost exactly three years after serving as the commander of Inspiration4, billionaire Jared Isaacman returned to space for Polaris Dawn, another SpaceX-facilitated mission with an all-civilian crew.', 'This time, the private astronauts donned special suits designed and developed by SpaceX so that they could exit the Dragon capsule and perform the first ever private spacewalk.

Space travel has moved beyond the realm of science fiction,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2577006,"['https://arab.news/5v8qf', 'The world watched in awe on Oct. 13 as the 20-story-tall booster of SpaceX’s Starship rocket landed perfectly on the arms of the company’s launch tower near Brownsville, Texas. Fittingly for a major milestone toward SpaceX’s goal of making Starship a fully reusable rocket system, clips of the dramatic first catch of the booster went viral on social networks. For a few hours, it seemed that interplanetary travel was no longer confined to the realm of science fiction.\nHowever, just because SpaceX owner Elon Musk has stated that his ambition is to send a manned mission to Mars does not guarantee that he will achieve this goal in his lifetime. Back in 2016, he predicted that the first crewed launches to Mars could occur within six years, despite the heavy rocket needed for the mission still being at the concept stage. ', 'In a speech in Mexico outlining his vision for manned missions to the Red Planet, he identified “two fundamental paths” facing humanity today: “One is that we stay on Earth forever and then there will be an inevitable extinction event. The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilization and a multi-planetary species.” Eight years later, within minutes of the successful Oct. 13 booster catch, Musk gushed on X that a “big step toward making life multiplanetary was made today.”\nWhat this “big step” signifies for now is something more modest. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson captured the sentiment in his congratulations on X: “As we prepare to go back to the moon under #Artemis, continued testing will prepare us for the bold missions that lie ahead — including to the South Pole region of the Moon and then on to Mars.”\nIndeed, if perfect booster catches become commonplace in the coming months, NASA’s plan to once again land humans on the moon by 2026 will no longer seem overly ambitious, especially given that one of the many reasons for delays is a lack of partner hardware. The proposed Human Landing System, which will take humans from lunar orbit to the surface and then return astronauts to orbit, is essentially a modified form of Starship.\nThe idea of routine interplanetary travel has been with us since it was vividly conjured in Arthur C. Clarke’s science-fiction novel “2001: A Space Odyssey” in 1968. Written at a time when humans had not yet set foot on the moon, and space exploration programs in the US and the Soviet Union were only beginning, the novel envisioned a future of interstellar travel.\nToday, private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are driving innovation at a much faster pace than traditional government space agencies could manage in the past. Advances in propulsion systems, including research into ion thrusters and nuclear propulsion, promise faster and more energy-efficient space travel. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Starship have revolutionized space travel by developing reusable rockets, drastically reducing launch costs. Payload capacity has increased substantially, with Starship able to carry over 100 metric tonnes of cargo, supporting large-scale missions to Mars and beyond.', 'Saudi Arabia launched its first astronauts to the International Space Station in 2023 and aims to enhance its space sector through Vision 2030 initiatives.', 'Arnab Neil Sengupta', 'Moreover, deep-space communication has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Improvements in communication technology, including laser-based systems, will facilitate high-speed data transmission between planets. Additionally, autonomous navigation and AI are set to enhance mission management and ensure precise landings on other celestial bodies. Habitat development is also advancing, with NASA’s Artemis mission and research into habitats like the Lunar Gateway paving the way for sustainable off-Earth living conditions.\nSimultaneously, technologies such as on-site resource utilization could enable humans to harvest water, oxygen, and fuel from planetary bodies. Medical advancements, driven by research into human health in space, may help mitigate the risks of prolonged interplanetary travel. Ultimately, affordable interplanetary travel and exploration could stimulate new industries, tourism and resource extraction, generating a mix of economic and societal benefits.\nHowever, the potential drawbacks must not be overlooked.', 'The energy demands and pollution from frequent spacecraft launches could adversely affect Earth’s environment. Increased interplanetary missions might lead to a surge in space debris, complicating travel and endangering spacecraft. Initially, affordable travel may only be accessible to the wealthy, deepening existing economic and social divides. Moreover, competition for space resources or territorial claims could result in geopolitical tensions or conflicts on other planets.\nLastly, serious health hazards remain. Prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation and low-gravity environments could pose significant long-term health risks to astronauts and space tourists.\nOn Oct. 13, social media posts about the Starship booster catch briefly eclipsed discussions about the numerous conflicts raging across the Arab world. The juxtaposition of images showing the “super heavy” booster descending on a launch tower in one part of planet Earth and fiery rocket attacks and airstrikes in another part of it was surreal. But this is the reality of 2024.\nAn interesting comment on X by @ramia_yahia regarding the booster catch encapsulated the contrasting developments thus: “The company owned by Elon Musk plans to use Starship to colonize Mars. What do we Arabs aspire to?” For many Arabs, the answer to that question is likely “Peace and security in our time.” However, as the saying goes, time and tide wait for no man, and one could add: The march of technology is unstoppable.\nFar-sighted Arab leaders understand that the region cannot afford to miss the bus. Saudi Arabia launched its first astronauts to the International Space Station in 2023 and aims to enhance its space sector through Vision 2030 initiatives. The Saudi Space Agency was established in December 2018 by royal decree to develop and regulate the Kingdom’s space sector.', 'Similarly, the UAE has made rapid strides with its Hope Mars orbiter and plans for a lunar mission, having sent two Emiratis to the ISS as part of an ambitious program designed to inspire future generations and spark interest in space science and technology in the Arab world.\nAs mankind stands on the brink of a new era in space exploration, the possibilities are vast and mind-boggling. Even as their political leaders and top diplomats strive for regional peace and security, the aspirations of Arabs should reach as high as the stars.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

However, this time, it was not aiming for the Gulf of Mexico but rather back to the launch site for a catch. With the boost backburn completed, Booster 12 then reoriented itself for its glide back to the launch site.', 'As the booster came back through the atmosphere, the engine section started to glow due to the aerodynamic forces causing heat to build up on the cork of the engine shielding. Once at 1 km or so, the 13 center engines started up and performed the initial landing burn to bleed off most of the velocity.', 'Booster 12 Returning (Credit: Max Evans for NSF/L2)', 'Booster 12 then quickly switched to the three-center engines only and began translating itself over towards the tower while still slowly descending. SpaceX may have been targeting the wetlands to the east of the tower as a precaution.', 'Interestingly, on Friday night, Elon Musk-likely inadvertently-posted audio of a Flight 5 review meeting with SpaceX officials while gaming. The three-minute clip included notes that Booster 12 was one second away from trigging an abort away from the Tower into the launch site.', '“We had a misconfigured spin gas support that didn’t have quite the right ramp-up time for bringing up spin pressure and we were one second away from that tripping and telling the rocket to abort and try to crash into the ground next to the tower instead of the tower,” noted the unidentified SpaceX manager on the call, in reference to a large amount of abort modes that can be triggered by the rocket.', '“I knew we had a whole bunch of new aborts and commit criteria that we tried to double-check really well, but I think our concern was well placed, and one of these came very close to biting us.”', 'The chine on Booster 12, via Mary for NSF', '“Just before engines started up, one of the chine covers ripped off, which is something we were worried about. These spot weld margins on chine skin before flight, we wouldn’t have predicted the exact right place, but this cover that ripped off was right on top of a bunch of the single point failure valves that must work during the landing burn,” the meeting added.', '“So thankfully, none of those or the harnessing got damaged, but we were just trying to cover up over some really critical equipment right as landing burn was starting.”', 'The call noted that they have plans to address this issue.', 'Thankfully, none of the “scary sh–” as the manager called it, occurred during Booster 12’s return, as it then translated over before angling into the chopsticks, which were closing at this moment in preparation to catch.
