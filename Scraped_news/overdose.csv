"Overdose deaths have continued to drop, now at their lowest level in three years, data shows",https://www.wbal.com/overdose-deaths-have-continued-to-drop-now-at-their-lowest-level-in-three-years-data-shows/,"['(ATLANTA) — The estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. have been dropping for months and are now at their lowest levels in three years, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).', 'Deaths from overdoses dropped for the first time in five years in 2023, following a steady rise during the pandemic. However, the current number of overdose deaths still remains higher than pre-pandemic levels.', 'In April 2024, the latest month with data, the estimated number of deaths in the past 12 months was 101,168, according to the CDC. The last month with figures that low was in May of 2021, with 100,997 deaths.', 'Data from other sources, such as emergency department visits and calls to EMS, support the downward trend, according to an analysis led by Dr. Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the Injury Prevention Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He tells ABC News that the data may point to 20,000 fewer deaths annually, or more.', 'While experts continue to explore possible reasons driving the decline, there are a few public health initiatives to curb drug overdoses that may be showing signs of success.', '“Enhanced access to naloxone, expanded treatment programs for opioid use disorder, and increased public awareness about the dangers of synthetic opioids like fentanyl are likely playing significant roles in saving lives,” said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor.', 'Another potential explanation for the downturn, Dasgupta says, may be related to changes in the drug supply, such as more people using xylazine, a dangerous, non-opioid animal sedative that’s often mixed with other illicit drugs, including fentanyl.', '“Xylazine makes people use less fentanyl, is the bottom line,” Dasgupta told ABC News, while citing research that showed that those who overdosed and tested positive for xylazine had less severe health outcomes than those who did not have xylazine in their system. This could be due to the fact that those who used illicit substances, like fentanyl, mixed with xylazine may be using those substances less often, Dasgupta said.', '“We’re seeing this pattern kind of happening that looks a lot like a change in the drug supply, more so than just explained by all the interventions in the public health space,” Dasgupta added. “It’s probably a mix of all these things at the end of the day, but something really changed in the third quarter of last year.”', 'Within each state, however, the decline in overdose deaths is not uniform among all people. Maryland, for example, experienced a decline in deaths among white populations, yet an increase among Black populations, Dasgupta points out.', 'Changes in drug overdose deaths also vary greatly by state, with some still experiencing increases in the past 12 months, CDC data shows. States with the greatest dips in overdose deaths over the past year, according to the same data, were Nebraska, North Carolina, Vermont, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, in that descending order.', 'While the national downward trend may continue, experts told ABC News it may not be permanent.', '“We’ve seen dips that have been erased a year later. So, I’m cautious. I feel like things really haven’t cooled down yet,” Dasgupta said. “It feels like we’ve put the lid on the pot, but we’re still at a rolling boil. There’s still a lot of people dying of overdose.”', '“It’s crucial that we continue to intensify our efforts to address the root causes of the opioid epidemic,” Brownstein said. “We need to continue investing in comprehensive strategies that address the complex factors driving the opioid crisis.”', 'Jake Goodman, MD, MBA is a psychiatry resident physician and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.', 'Copyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Overall, in the twelve months beginning April 2023, the United States saw a decrease in drug overdose deaths of more than 12 percent—marking the first year since 2020 that overdose deaths have fallen.', 'The exact causes of the decrease are not yet completely clear to experts. Dr. Nora Volkow of the National Institute on Drug Abuse said that “expansion of naloxone,” which is used to quickly reverse the respiratory depression associated with opioid overdoses, and other opioid medications, are among the strategies that have worked.', 'Previous data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse has shown that, since 2015, more people have died from opioid overdoses than from any other drugs. Research shows that making Narcan—naloxone’s trade name—available at syringe sites reduces deaths by around 65 percent.', 'The fall in overdose deaths does vary by state. For example, according to the CDC, North Carolina saw a 40 percent decrease in drug overdose deaths—but others, such as Alaska, saw an equal increase. Alaska’s case is particularly alarming, as the state has the highest proportion of Indigenous people in the county, whom CDC data shows are more likely to die from drug overdoses.', 'Even in areas where drug overdose deaths are increasing, as the NPR report highlights, investigating which strategies work should lead to more effective measures throughout the country.

While this number is still higher than the nearly 72,000 fatal overdoses recorded in 2019, the recent data indicates a positive trend."", 'One of the significant contributors to this decline is the reduction in fentanyl-related deaths. Deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have decreased by 20% year-over-year, now accounting for about two-thirds of all fatal overdoses, down from over three-quarters a year prior.', '', '', 'Experts attribute the downward trend to a combination of ongoing efforts, including enhanced access to naloxone, expanded treatment programs for opioid use disorder, and increased public awareness about the risks associated with synthetic opioids like fentanyl.', 'While this progress is promising at the national level, experts caution against complacency, noting that there may be significant disparities in the impact of the overdose epidemic on certain populations.

The data compares two 12-month periods — one ending in April 2023 and the other in April 2024.', 'The numbers are provisional for each state, which means when the data is finalized, the shifts could look a little different.', 'The predictive data for Utah shows a 8.08% increase in overdose deaths — 722 deaths for the yearlong period ending in April 2024, and 668 deaths in the yearlong period ending in April 2023. The U.S. overall is predicted to see a 10% decline in overdose deaths.', 'Megan Broekemeier, drug overdose prevention research coordinator for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told the Deseret News over email that preliminary data from the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner shows a 16.7% increase in drug overdose deaths from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, compared to April 1, 2022, to March 2023.', 'Broekemeier said she could not say why this was happening, but fentanyl-involved overdoses were continually increasing.', '“Utah’s trends haven’t aligned with national trends for some time. We plateaued while overdoses increased significantly at the national level, especially during the pandemic,” said Broekemeier. “We haven’t seen statistically significant changes in the rate yet, but it’s possible if the increase in fentanyl-involved deaths continues at its current pace.”', 'Three of the states bordering Utah — Nevada, Wyoming and Colorado — also show predicted increases: Nevada at 18.17%, Wyoming at 2.38% and Colorado at 3.89%.', 'Oregon and Washington also are expected to see an increase.', 'Data from the East tells a different story. It is predicted the District of Columbia will see a small increase in overdose deaths at less than 1%, but states in the East show decreases.', 'North Carolina shows a predicted decline of almost 23% from the yearlong period ending in April 2023 to the yearlong period ending in April 2024.

We can’t arrest our way out of the overdose crisis,https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/we-cant-arrest-our-way-out-of-the-overdose-crisis/,"['New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests overdose deaths in the United States may finally be declining. This trend gives those working in drug policy, harm reduction and related community outreach our first cause for hope in a long time. ', 'As with any public health issue, the reasons overdose deaths have slowed are many and complicated. However, these data tell us we’ve been doing something right: experts primarily attribute the decline in overdose deaths to the expansion of harm reduction tools — distribution of sterile syringes and naloxone, for example — and evidence-based treatment. On International Overdose Awareness Day (August 31), we urge our leaders and lawmakers to embrace this momentum and prioritize the pragmatic, life-saving approach.', 'Unfortunately, in 2024, we have witnessed the opposite as harm reduction has come under attack. Idaho repealed its law authorizing the distribution of sterile syringes. We have seen the rise of laws targeting people who share or have illicit substances. For example, governments have scheduled novel (sometimes harmless or potentially helpful) substances without evaluating their effects and further criminalized exposing others (even unknowingly) to fentanyl via drug-induced homicide and first-responder “protection” bills.', 'These law enforcement-heavy policies are of questionable benefit and may make it harder to save lives. The iron law of prohibition tells us that overcriminalization incentivizes manufacturers to innovate new and more potent substances. At the same time, busts can make the supply less transparent and thus more dangerous for consumers. Time in jail or prison increases the risk for a range of health consequences, including overdose and hepatitis C. Both factors increase overdose risk.', 'Furthermore, criminal records often prevent people who use drugs from finding jobs and stable housing, hindering and complicating even the most desired recovery journeys. And these consequences have lasting effects on a person’s life.', 'One of us (Amanda Hall) is a native of Appalachian Kentucky, a region that was ground zero for the prescription opioid epidemic and continues to be struck by the overdose crisis. She received two five-year sentences for selling two of her prescribed pills. The resulting incarceration meant living in a Kentucky prison hours away from family who lacked the financial means to visit. It meant missing her children’s first words and first steps. This is not time that can be reclaimed, and the loss still causes heartache more than a decade later.', 'It is time for us to do better. We have a chance, but only if we hold our policymakers accountable.', 'When implemented correctly, harm reduction can save lives. It is a pragmatic approach, with sufficient support and without overregulation. It has garnered some support at the highest levels from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.', 'However, there is still work to do. We need more naloxone distribution, primarily by community-based organizations that understand their clients’ wants and needs. We need sterile equipment to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. We need further reaching and lower barrier access to evidence-based treatment such as methadone, a gold-standard medication for opioid use disorder.', 'U.S. voters must take a careful and objective look at harm reduction — free from the fear-mongering narratives that have popped up in recent years. We aren’t going to fix our overdose crisis by only talking about the border. And we can’t arrest our way out of this public health crisis. Instead, our elected officials must learn from the small but promising success suggested by the emerging data and show us they will work to reduce demand and minimize harm.', 'Fifty-plus years of a war on drugs have cost taxpayers trillions of dollars and done little to stem the suffering associated with illicit drug use. Instead, it has made the supply more dangerous and entangled people who use drugs within the prison system instead of providing them with access to the resources they need to make healthier, safer choices.', 'When policy prioritizes prohibition and interdiction, focusing only on supply and not demand, it risks derailing the potential of millions of people who use drugs. We can give them — and our communities — a fighting chance by turning our attention to harm reduction and treatment. And in doing so, more effectively reduce the risk of overdose.', '1411 K Street N.W., Suite 900\nWashington, D.C. 20005\n\nMedia Inquiries: pr@rstreet.org', '(202) 525-5717\nfeedback@rstreet.org', 'Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date with the latest research and learn about upcoming events.', '', '']"

They’re all stories to me. They're not just numbers.” The speaker is Dennis Cauchon, founder and president of Harm Reduction Ohio. He’s been tracking provisional drug overdose data for nearly seven years and viewing tiny decreases. “It would have been just like small numbers—just, instead of 40 deaths in September, it was like 20, and so it wasn't enough to go on,” Cauchon told me. But by early 2024, when that line continued to arch downward, Cauchon said the data was showing him more than tiny incremental changes. These were real changes."", ""National surveys compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show an unprecedented 10.6 percent decline in drug deaths.

""This is going to be the best year we\'ve had since all of this started.""', ""While many are offering theories about why the drop in deaths is happening at unprecedented speed, most experts agree the data doesn't yet provide clear answers. Fentanyl may be harder to find and less pure in some areas because of law enforcement efforts targeting Mexican drug cartels."", 'Naloxone, Buprenorphine, and Methadone Helped', 'Many people abusing fentanyl now carry naloxone (Narcan), a medication that reverses most opioid overdoses. Also, most friends of drug abusers carry the lifesaving drug and are ready to use it if a friend overdoses. Many people who use drugs have been rescued with naloxone and entered treatment programs with medication-assisted treatments like buprenorphine or methadone. While they are in treatment, the risks of overdose and death are markedly reduced.', 'Maybe Xylazine, Too', 'Another possible reason for the drop in overdose deaths is that the chemical xylazine is being mixed with fentanyl by drug gangs. While toxic to humans, causing zombie-like behavior in addicts and serious long-term health problems, xylazine could affect the number of deaths by diluting the amount of fentanyl users get. Experts point also to the end of the COVID pandemic, combined with the incredibly high number of people who have already died from drug overdoses (and were at high risk), as possible causes of the abrupt change.', 'More on Ohio', 'A Few States Had Much Higher Death Rates', 'Surprisingly, Washington and Oregon experienced notable increases in overdose deaths. Washington and Oregon experienced the highest percentage increases in overdose deaths in the U.S. from September 2022 to September 2023, with Washington seeing a 41.4% rise and Oregon 41.5%.

However, deaths related to psychostimulants (like methamphetamine) and cocaine rose during that time. This divergence highlights the complexity of the drug crisis, which some experts have called the American Disease; as we go from one substance to the next, never learning that it is unlikely we will find the new perfect drug.', 'Cautious Enthusiasm: It’s Not Over', 'It’s not all over, of course. Roughly 100,000 drug overdose deaths still occur in the U.S. annually. Canada has the second most overdose deaths in the world, at 7,000; the United Kingdom has 4,500, Australia and Germany around 2,000. In the U.S., street drug cocktails, including fentanyl, methamphetamines, xylazine, and other synthetic chemicals are more poisonous than ever.

Provisional drug overdose death counts conducted by the CDC show an unprecedented 10.6 percent decline in overdose deaths in the 12-month ending period in April 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year. There has been a huge increase in drug overdose deaths over the past decade, with numbers rising from around 40,000 in 2015 to over 100,000 by 2024—so a decline is truly significant.\n\nResearchers are still parsing the drug overdose data, trying to make sense of a complex problem, and overall, the report is quite cautious about interpreting these changes. While they can’t point to one silver bullet that is reversing the trend, they can point to a few factors that are contributing—and not all are necessarily good. For instance, deaths initially reported as having a “pending investigation” status can significantly underestimate the true death count, especially in places like North Carolina with higher percentages of such cases.', 'NPR, which broke the news, spoke to an expert on street drugs from the University of North Carolina named Nabarun Dasgupta who says that the numbers coming out of some states show a 20 and sometimes even 30 percent decrease.
