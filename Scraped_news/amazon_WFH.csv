Amazon Forces RTO 5 Days A Week—Why Do Companies Fear Remote Work?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/09/19/amazon-forces-rto-5-days-a-week-why-do-companies-fear-remote-work/,"['Why are companies like Amazon afraid of remote work to the point of annihilating it altogether, even ... [+]', 'In recent news that has exploded across the internet like wildfire, Amazon has become the latest company to join the ranks of employers mandating a full return-to-office policy, to be actioned on January 2, 2025.', ""According to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's memo that was shared with CNBC, the organization's senior leadership team wants to make two major shifts with the goal of improving their overall efficiency at work, driving higher performance, removing silos and unnecessarily complicated processes, and empowering a culture of innovation, connection, and rapid growth."", 'Two issues identified from the memo, which Jassy raised, were first, having ""the right organizational structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire,"" and second, being ""set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other (and our culture) to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business that we can.""', 'What sent shockwaves across social media and the internet was when the CEO announced, as the solution for the second problem, that the company would be initiating not one, not two, not even three or four, but five full days in the office (with the exception being extenuating circumstances or an approved remote work exception).', '""Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,"" one LinkedIn member and AWS employee posted to LinkedIn. ""If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again,"" he said.', 'When you consider the effects of driving employees to full-time in-office work, it seems pretty counterintuitive when it comes to increasing productivity, morale, and company culture.', 'CEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.', '', '', '', 'The numbers are striking:', ""(This data is captured from LiveCareer's Fears and Remote Work report 2024.)"", 'Only 2% of workers claim to enjoy fully on-site work, which demonstrates that an in-office work ... [+]', 'Jake Smith, a CEO of a workspace solutions company, sees both sides of the issue: ""While in-person interaction is valuable for company culture, forcing all employees back full-time could hamper productivity and work-life balance.""', 'Referencing his company, Evo Technologies, Smith said ""we implemented automated solutions like AI agents and smart office software to enable seamless remote work. Productivity increased over 20% as employees gained more flexibility and autonomy. However, we still encourage in-person meetups a few times a month for collaboration.', '""A hybrid model provides the best of both worlds. While technologies enable remote productivity, total return to office risks losing top talent seeking more flexibility. Companies should trust employees and managers to find the right balance for their teams. A one-size-fits-all mandate hampers creativity that thrives with autonomy,"" Smith believes.', 'Andrei Kurtuy, co-founder of resume builder software company Novoresume, believes that Amazon’s recent decision to require employees to return to the office full-time by January 2025 sets a concerning precedent, especially for those who have found remote work more productive and aligned with their personal lives.', 'He weighs in: ""While Amazon claims in-person collaboration enhances innovation and efficiency, many employees have adapted to remote work environments that allow them to focus better and maintain a healthier work-life balance.', '""I think this shift will negatively impact workers who have come to prefer the flexibility and productivity gains of working from home. Forcing them back into a traditional office setting may lead to lower job satisfaction, higher turnover, and challenges in retaining top talent, especially among those who excel in a remote environment. Many industries have proven that remote work doesn’t hinder innovation but, instead, fosters new ways of collaboration with digital tools.', '""Amazon’s move seems out of step with modern work trends, which are increasingly embracing flexibility. While in-office work may benefit some roles, applying a blanket policy could alienate a large portion of the workforce who have thrived remotely.""', 'Forcing employees back to the office sets the precedent for high turnover and lowers performance, ... [+]', 'Why might this be happening? Why are companies who once favored remote work and flexibility during and shortly after the pandemic, returning to pre-pandemic ""ideals"" again?', 'There are several possible reasons.', ""Nicole Martins Ferreira, a product marketing manager at Huntr.co, a job search tool, offers one clue as to what she believes might be a driving motivation for companies of Amazon's size:"", '""Although we know that people tend to be more productive at home than in office, companies of Amazon\'s size might be mandating return to office because they\'re trying to reduce staff size without having to pay severance. Whenever companies announce return to office mandates, employees who prefer remote work tend to quit. This may just be Amazon\'s way of saving costs on headcount,"" she suggests.', 'According to a recent survey of 1,551 U.S. business leaders by Resume Templates, although more than half of employers know that increasing in-office days goes against employee preferences, one in 10 companies are increasing RTO days to drive employees to quit, with half citing it as a strategy to avoid layoffs.', ""SEO strategist Ashot Nanayan, however, views it differently. He believes there might be three core motivators behind Amazon's decision:"", '""Many leaders cling to the notion that innovation thrives in the office, fueled by casual interactions and spontaneous brainstorming,"" he says. ""However, this belief often overlooks the fact that structured remote collaboration can also lead to significant breakthroughs. Companies might fear that without these in-person moments, they will miss out on potential creative sparks, yet this perspective can stifle the diverse ways teams can connect and innovate.""', 'The second reason Nanayan cites is the fear of remote work diluting company culture. ""Corporate culture is often viewed as a cornerstone of a successful organization,"" he explains. ""Yet, this fear can lead to a control-oriented approach, undermining the trust and flexibility that many employees now expect. Organizations that prioritize a strong culture should consider cultivating it in a hybrid setting rather than defaulting to full-time office mandates.""', 'Another possible reason is the assumption that remote work equates to lower productivity, which persists in many corporate environments. ""While some leaders believe that physical oversight ensures accountability, studies show that productivity can thrive outside traditional settings,"" Nanayan says. ""This paradox highlights a lack of trust in employees, which can ultimately harm morale and engagement. Companies need to reassess their success metrics beyond mere presence in the office.""', ""Back to LiveCareer's Fear and Remote work report, it is clear that remote working, even if in a hybrid model, brings undeniable advantages. For example, according to the study, 71% of employees even favor fully remote work, with women (73%) showing a stronger preference than men (63%)."", 'Lack of remote work availability hurts a major segment of the workforce—women', ""It's a tough balancing act for organizations, but if we are to truly move forward and attract more talent—especially diverse talent (and especially women)—it's essential to take a step back and think about what is truly best for our people, even if it means making a compromise with a hybrid model. When a company's people are put first, the bottom line, productivity, and culture will take care of itself."", 'Rachel Wells is a Forbes contributor and freelance writer who covers remote and flexible working, freelancing, side hustles, skill...

Now, the company is giving employees until Jan. 2 to start adhering to the new policy.', 'Corporate employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week “outside of extenuating circumstances” or unless they have been granted an exception by their organization’s S-team leader, Jassy said, referring to the close-knit group of executives that report to Amazon’s CEO.', '“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward — our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,” Jassy said.', 'Amazon also plans to simplify its corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to “remove layers and flatten organizations,” Jassy said. Each S-team organization will be expected to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, he said. Individual contributors refers to employees who typically do not manage other staffers.', 'Amazon said each team will review their structure as part of the process, and that it’s possible they’ll identify roles that are no longer required. Any changes or adjustments will be announced at the team level, the company added.', 'The company rapidly grew its headcount over the course of the pandemic before Jassy took the helm and instituted widespread cost cuts across Amazon, including the largest layoffs in its 27 years as a public company. Amazon’s headcount totaled 1.53 million employees in the second quarter, representing growth of just 5% from a year earlier. By comparison, Amazon’s workforce expanded 14% to 1.52 million employees in the second quarter of 2022.', 'Jassy wrote in a lengthy missive to staffers that Amazon is making the changes to strengthen its corporate culture and ensure that it remains nimble. He underscored the point by saying the company created a “bureaucracy mailbox,” or dedicated email alias, to root out any unnecessary processes or excessive rules within the company.', '“We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” Jassy wrote. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.”', 'Amazon shares ticked lower in afternoon trading.', 'Here is the full memo from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy:', 'Hey team. I wanted to send a note on a couple changes we’re making to further strengthen our culture and teams.', 'First, for perspective, I feel good about the progress we’re making together. Stores, AWS, and Advertising continue to grow on very large bases, Prime Video continues to expand, and new investment areas like GenAI, Kuiper, Healthcare, and several others are evolving nicely. And at the same time we’re growing and inventing, we’re also continuing to make progress on our cost structure and operating margins, which isn’t easy to do. Overall, I like the direction in which we’re heading and appreciate the hard work and ingenuity of our teams globally.', 'When I think about my time at Amazon, I never imagined I’d be at the company for 27 years. My plan (which my wife and I agreed to on a bar napkin in 1997) was to be here a few years and move back to NYC. Part of why I’ve stayed has been the unprecedented growth (we had $15M of annual revenue the year before I joined—this year should be well north of $600B), the perpetual hunger to invent, the obsession with making customers’ lives easier and better every day, and the associated opportunities these priorities present. But, the biggest reason I’m still here is our culture. Being so customer focused is an inspiring part of it, but it’s also the people we work with, the way we collaborate and invent when we’re at our best, our long-term perspective, the ownership I’ve always felt at every level I’ve worked (I started as a Level 5), the speed with which we make decisions and move, and the lack of bureaucracy and politics.', 'Our culture is unique, and has been one of the most critical parts of our success in our first 29 years. But, keeping your culture strong is not a birthright. You have to work at it all the time. When you consider the breadth of our businesses, their associated growth rates, the innovation required across each of them, and the number of people we’ve hired the last 6-8 years to pursue these endeavors, it’s pretty unusual—and will stretch even the strongest of cultures. Strengthening our culture remains a top priority for the s-team and me. And, I think about it all the time.', 'We want to operate like the world’s largest startup. That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.', 'Two areas that the s-team and I have been thinking about the last several months are: 1/ do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire? 2/ are we set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other (and our culture) to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business that we can? We think we can be better on both.', 'On the first topic, we’ve always sought to hire very smart, high judgment, inventive, delivery-focused, and missionary teammates. And, we have always wanted the people doing the actual detailed work to have high ownership. As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers. In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It’s created artifacts that we’d like to change (e.g., pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere, etc.). Most decisions we make are two-way doors, and as such, we want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.', 'So, we’re asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. We will do this thoughtfully, and our PxT team will work closely with our leaders to evolve our organizations to accomplish these goals over the next few months.', '[By the way, I’ve created a “Bureaucracy Mailbox” for any examples any of you see where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out…to be clear, companies need process to run effectively, and process does not equal bureaucracy, but unnecessary and excessive process or rules should be called out and extinguished. I will read these emails and action them accordingly.]', 'To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant. I’ve previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, we’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits.', 'Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well. But, before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances (like the ones mentioned above) or if you already have a Remote Work Exception approved through your s-team leader.', 'We are also going to bring back assigned desk arrangements in locations that were previously organized that way, including the U.S. headquarters locations (Puget Sound and Arlington). For locations that had agile desk arrangements before the pandemic, including much of Europe, we will continue to operate that way.', 'We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we’re going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025. Global Real Estate and Facilities (GREF) is working on a plan to accommodate desk arrangements mentioned above and will communicate the details as they are finalized.', 'I want to thank our leaders and support teams in advance for the work they will do to improve their org structures over the coming months. With a company of our size and complexity, the work won’t be trivial and it will test our collective ability to invent and simplify when it comes to how we organize and go after the meaningful opportunities we have across all of our businesses.', 'Having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted. I continue to believe that we are all here because we want to make a difference in customers’ lives, invent on their behalf, and move quickly to solve their problems. I’m optimistic that these changes will better help us accomplish these goals while strengthening our culture and the effectiveness of our teams.', 'Thanks, Andy', 'Got a confidential news tip?

"I Work at Amazon and I Plan on 'Coffee Badging' Instead of Working From the Office 5 Days a Week
An Amazon engineer in Germany said his colleagues are ""very shocked and worried,"" calling the move ""a betrayal."" The new RTO policy could also be used as a tool to carry out silent layoffs, they mused.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/i-work-at-amazon-i-plan-to-coffee-badge-new-rto-policy/480047,"['', 'BY JYOTI MANN SEP 18, 2024', 'Share', '', 'This article originally appeared on Business Insider.', 'This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with an Amazon worker in Germany who spoke anonymously to protect their privacy. Their identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.', 'Amazon notified all employees on Monday about the new return-to-office mandate requiring us to come into the office five days a week from January.', 'My entire team was very shocked and worried. Some people want to leave the company. This is a betrayal to many people, especially those who were hired as remote workers, and it is eroding our trust.', ""Before Amazon made the announcement this week, I already had a feeling that a stricter return-to-office mandate was coming in 2025. That's because the leadership had made it very clear that this was the direction they were going to take through the last mandate, and in the last few months, things have become much stricter."", ""In Germany, Amazon started enforcing the mandate that requires us to be in the office three days a week in June, but unlike in the US, we aren't required to come in for a certain number of hours a day. People are still trying to adjust to the last return-to-office push."", ""I live very close to the office, so I'm not personally so worried about having to do another two days in the office because I can just come in and swipe my badge, stay for 15 minutes, and go back, so we still have some flexibility."", ""I think the return to office policy is being used as a tool to carry out silent layoffs, as I've seen many bright engineers leave the company after the last mandate."", 'People are definitely terrified about what this will mean for them. A few colleagues have contacted me and told me they are considering leaving the company, even going to lower-paying jobs.', 'Having a flexible remote working policy did not have a big impact on productivity. If you create an atmosphere of growth and drive people, they will always deliver, regardless of where they work.', ""I think this has been sufficient as long as people do their jobs to their best. I see the value in coming together occasionally and brainstorming, but outside that, it's unnecessary to always work from the office."", 'The new mandate will be difficult for many people who moved away from the office during the pandemic, have childcare commitments, or experience social anxiety and are now forced to come into the office.', 'Apart from the RTO announcement, I only found out in the news that Amazon plans to reduce the number of middle managers by 15%, so it was a surprise because we already have a resource crunch. We have fewer people doing a lot more work, which has meant that I, and some other employees, have felt unhappy.', 'Now with Amazon wanting to reduce the head count going forward, it will make things very difficult for employees.

Angry. Thrilling: 'Exit Interview' examines Amazon’s culture through the eyes of a former exec"", 'Jassy\'s letter buries the lede, so to speak. After writing about his own personal Amazon story that began in 1997, he lays out an argument for two points: trimming back company bureaucracy and maintaining Amazon\'s company culture. Company culture is code for, ""coming into the office five days per week.""', 'For starters, Jassy said Amazon\'s growth has led to more managers, and that has led to what he calls ""artifacts we\'d like to change."" This means issues such as having more layers and processes, and ""pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings,"" which slows things down. In other words, it somewhat sounds like Amazon has a case of the ""Ineffectual Middle Management Suck-Ups.""

The company began a hybrid work schedule in May 2023 that required employees to be in the office three days per week. A group of employees protested the policy, partially arguing that it would increase Amazon\'s carbon footprint. By September, the company began monitoring when and how many times employees swiped their badges to enter an Amazon office building. This came after it was discovered that some employees were swiping their badge to enter a building, grabbing coffee, and then returning home to do their jobs.

In response, some employees quit. Jassy also said that while employees could disagree with the three-day policy, they still had to commit to it. And if they could not do that, ""it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon.”', 'Now, Amazon is taking the next step and moving back to an in-office schedule, five days per week.', '""Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week,"" Jassy wrote in his letter this week. ""If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely. This was understood, and will be moving forward as well.

CEO Andy Jassy shared the news to employees in a Monday memo, also announcing changes to the managerial structure.', 'The end of a flexible work-from-home mandate has a more meaningful impact for the average employee. This decision has drawn considerable attention, particularly from former employees such as John McBride, a former Amazon Web Services (AWS) software engineer, who shared his opinions in an X post.', 'McBride, who worked at AWS for a year before resigning due to Amazon’s insistence on relocating from Denver to Seattle, believes the move to reinstate full office presence is primarily driven by economic factors — as headcount reduction helps the company boost its margin.', 'Amazon hired heavily in the COVID-19 aftershock, adding over 400,000 employees through 2020. McBride believes the company has overhired and since then, has gone through several phases, starting with mass layoffs and gradually implementing stricter office requirements to push employees into resigning if they refuse to relocate.', 'His former colleague, former AWS senior developer Justin Garrison, documented such a practice as ""The Silent Sacking.""', 'Garrison explained that instead of openly laying off employees, Amazon quietly encourages them to leave by making their roles undesirable. Employees are excluded from meetings, given unfulfilling work and generally made to feel unwelcome, pushing them to quit voluntarily.', 'This method helps Amazon cut costs without formally announcing mass layoffs or offering severance packages. His experiences show a company that quietly subverts its employees, avoiding the public scrutiny of large-scale firings.', 'While the means offer a reasonably clear explanation, the ends are mixed.', ""McBride's claim about AWS's thin operating margins is unsubstantiated. That segment has been the most profitable, with margins reaching almost 40%."", 'Still, his remark on tax breaks and the office presents a more reasonable angle. In 2022, Amazon received at least $5 billion in U.S.-based tax breaks and other subsidies from 38 states, with $824 million coming from Virginia, where the corporation has a second domestic headquarters.', 'The company specifically located the second headquarters there, Crystal City, which is part of Arlington, Virginia, after asking for subsidy proposals from state and local governments.', 'Furthermore, office-based work can positively impact local economies by supporting restaurants, transportation and other services around corporate hubs.
