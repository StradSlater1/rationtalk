Reuters reports that a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed a facility storing missiles, guided bombs and artillery ammunition, causing an ""earthquake-sized"" blast which showed up on seismic monitors and NASA satellites which picked up intense heat emanating from a 14 square kilometre (5 square mile) area. This is the latest in a series of Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian sites, including airfields and energy infrastructure.', 'Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst, told USA TODAY that Ukraine\'s ability to produce drones domestically as one reason for increased success in these attacks on Russia. ""Ukraine has filled out a very wide, deep stock of long-range, domestically produced drones. The most recent strike was reportedly the largest and it primarily targeted energy infrastructure.""', '""We\'ve seen strikes against ammunition depots and elements of the Russian defense-industrial base trying to degrade Russian efforts to mobilize defense industry to increase production of military equipment and another place where we\'ve seen the Ukrainian strike campaign focus on is Russian airfields,"" Bailey said, adding that these airfield strikes reduce Russia\'s security and their ability to conduct consistent glide bomb attacks against Ukraine.', ""Bailey sees strikes on infrastructure as aimed at reducing Russia's oil refining capacity, both to supply the Russian military and to degrade a source of funding to the Kremlin in the long term. And energy infrastructure is not the only target of these Ukrainian drone attacks."", ""On Sept. 3, a Russian ballistic missile struck a military school in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, killing 58 and injuring 320, according to the Associated Press. Citing Ukrainian officials, The Associated Press reported the attack also struck a nearby hospital, describing it as one of the deadliest strikes since the war began. The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Telegram that the strike targeted the 179th joint training center of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Poltava, which specializes in communications and electronic warfare training. It came days after Kyiv's largest drone attack to date."", ""Russia has attacked civilian targets since the war began. Notable incidents include the attacks on Kramatorsk railway station in April 2022, which killed 63; a Dnipro apartment building in January 2023, which killed 46; and a Hroza cafe in October 2023, which killed 59. The Russian attack on the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol is likely the war's most deadly attack on civilians. An Associated Press investigation found evidence that up to 600 people sheltering there were killed. Initial Ukrainian estimates placed the death toll at 300."", 'Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst, now a senior director at the Atlantic Council, told USA TODAY that the Poltava attack was the largest airstrike since the major Russian air campaign began in the Fall of 2022 and interpreted it as Moscow\'s frustrated response to the Kursk incursion. ""I call it a tantrum strike because it has very little military effect. It causes a great deal of pain, but strategically, it\'s of limited value,"" Herbst said.', 'Bailey, the Russia analyst for the war institute told told USA TODAY that the Russian military may believe there is an operational aim to such attacks. ""When Russian forces first started their large-scale missile and drone strike campaign in October of 2022 the explicit aim was to destroy Ukrainian morale, to destroy Ukraine\'s will to continue to fight the war. They aimed to collapse the Ukrainian energy grid and use winter as this intense pressure to get the Ukrainian nation, to get the Ukrainian people to abandon their resistance. That effort failed.""', '""If you view some of these strikes in that lens, you can start to see that some of the strikes on civilian targets could be intentional, that it could be this effort to try to demoralize Ukraine through strike after strike against civilian targets,"" said Bailey.', 'Seth Jones, director of the international Security Program and vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told USA TODAY that the Poltava attack is fairly consistent with the Russian military strategy in Ukraine, Syria and Chechnya before that. ""CSIS has documented numerous strikes against hospitals in Syria that were treating elements of the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups. When they target the electricity grid, when they\'ve targeted other civilian targets, it is in part attempting to influence, undermine the morale of a population.""', '""Having visited Ukraine numerous times during the war, when your city comes under attack, you feel it. There\'s an element of fear. I don\'t think it is undermining morale within the Ukrainian population, but that certainly is an important and desired end,"" Jones said.', 'The Poltava attack drew a strong response from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: ""Air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in a warehouse somewhere,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address. ""Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. Unfortunately, every day of delay means loss of life."" ', 'Jones told USA TODAY that while areas like downtown Kyiv are well defended with Patriot batteries, Ukraine doesn‚Äôt have enough material to defend all of their cities.', 'Ukraine was ""promised five Patriots at the NATO summit, and they were complaining that they received only one with the second one likely to arrive soon,‚Äù said former Ambassador Herbst. ‚ÄúIf they had five more Patriot batteries, there would be a good fewer number of Ukrainian dead civilians and maybe soldiers too.‚Äù ', 'Jones says that the biggest concern for Ukrainian officials is air defense. ""Ukrainians don\'t have a sufficient supply, and have to make judgment calls about what to shoot down and what not to, or they get overwhelmed.""', '""When you look at most of the strikes against cities in Ukraine, including the Poltava attacks, they\'re generally now a combination of cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, drones and decoys,"" Jones said.', 'According to Bailey, Russian forces are trying to seize on Ukraine\'s limitations, hoping that the large numbers of cruise missiles and drones overwhelm Ukraine\'s air defenses and allow ballistic missiles to get through. ""The Russians are fine with high interception rates with the drones,"" Bailey said. ""They often use them for that purpose: to both overwhelm the air defenses find out where the air defenses are, then launch the cruise missiles and the ballistic missiles in a way that will try to evade the air defenses and penetrate them.""', 'Bailey describes air defense as a layered umbrella: ""You want to make sure that a higher-end system, like the Patriot battery, that has proven effective at intercepting ballistic missiles, is in a place and will have the capability to respond to that, while your lower-end air defense systems can respond to cruise missiles, and you want even lower-end systems responding to the Shahed drones."" Both Jones and Bailey pointed to the importance of air support as part of a layered air defense strategy. Bailey told USA TODAY that a layered strategy is difficult to execute if you only have limited systems, and if you have continued pervasive shortages of air defense batteries and interceptors.', 'Last month, Ukraine launched multiple offensive attacks deeper into Russian territory. In one of the biggest assaults on Russia since the war began, Ukraine utilized drones to target several areas, including the capital of Moscow. Kyiv also launched a historic raid across the border destroying a convoy, capturing enemy soldiers and repurposing enemy equipment. Ukraine still controlled Russian territory in Kursk as of Wednesday. Ukraine has launched several counteroffensive operations against Russia throughout the war, most notably in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions in 2022. Ukraine also liberated many settlements in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia territories in 2023. ', 'Herbst says that Ukrainian attacks on Russian infrastructure have grown more successful. ""I\'ve seen reports of 14% or more of Russia\'s oil refining stock being destroyed, and that has both industrial implication and a military-industrial implication.‚Äù When it comes to attacking infrastructure, Herbst said, ‚ÄúRussia was there first and has done extraordinary damage in Ukraine.‚Äù', 'Russia targeted Ukrainian energy facilities in a series of airstrikes, according to a Sept. 19 report from Reuters, citing Ukrainian officials: A U.N. monitoring organization suggests the attacks violated humanitarian law and the International Energy agency fears electricity shortfall this winter.', 'Russia targeted Ukrainian energy facilities in a new wave of airstrikes, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday, despite a U.N. monitoring body saying attacks on the power grid probably violated humanitarian law.', 'Regional officials said civilian infrastructure had also been damaged, and the International Energy Agency warned of an electricity shortfall in Ukraine this winter.', 'The Kursk incursion has gotten the attention of the Russian military, evidenced by satellite images captured by Maxar Technologies that show new strategic trenches carved into Russian farmland 20 miles north of the Ukraine border.', '""Right now we are at a critical inflection point,"" Bailey said. ""With the incursion into Kursk Oblast, Ukrainian forces have been able to regain the initiative on a limited sector of the front line, start contesting Russia\'s theaterwide initiative, and start exerting operational pressures on Russian forces that Russian forces haven\'t experienced for all of 2024.""', '""We\'ve seen an effort by the Russian military command to silo their high-priority effort in Donetsk Oblast, specifically the offensive operation to seize Pokrovsk. We have seen indications that they have redeployed limited elements that were likely intended for that offensive operation on Pokrovsk, but nothing to suggest that the incursion into Kursk Oblast has heavily disrupted that offensive operation.""', 'A Sept. 14 assessment from the Institute for the Study of War notes claims from Ukrainian officials that the Kursk incursion has prompted Russia to triple the concentration of their forces there, but that individual breakdown of where those units are coming from remains unclear. The assessment indicates that a future Russian counter-offensive would require even more forces and additional redeployments from Ukraine.', 'While Bailey told USA TODAY that the war institute cannot confirm specific numbers, they have seen reports of redeployments from Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Kharkiv Oblasts, and that Russia appears to be selectively transferring parts of units as opposed to redirecting entire brigades to Kursk. ""In every sector of the front where there is active fighting, we have seen redeployments.""', '""They\'re trying to draw from elsewhere before they draw from their reserves and their forces in Donetsk Oblast, which is where they\'re conducting their priority offensive efforts,"" said Bailey.', 'Bailey does not see the either Ukrainian incursion or Russian attritional approach as decisive gambles and does not think that either country is currently capable of decisive war-winning operations. Instead, each must conduct multiple campaigns toward operationally significant objectives that are far short of victory. Nonetheless, Bailey thinks that comparing the two is important because it shows two diametrically opposed approaches to the war in Ukraine.', '""Russian forces have really embraced positional warfare in Ukraine. There\'s not rapid movement along the front line and they have determined that they are fine with this consistent attritional offensive that results in creeping gains, as long as that prevents Ukraine from being able to conduct significant counterattacks and retake territory,"" Bailey said.""The fighting in Pokrovsk itself had been a slow grind from village to village, and frontal infantry assault from one position to the next."" Bailey said that Russian forces have advanced only roughly 29 kilometers (18 miles) west of Avdiivka.""Kursk shows a different approach to war on the Ukrainian side: Ukraine still believes that it can liberate territory through rapid mechanized maneuver. Ukrainian forces leveraged operational surprise and maneuver warfare to advance roughly 28 kilometers (17.4 miles) into Kursk Oblast within the first week of the incursion.""', '""Ukrainian gains on Russian territory are deeply embarrassing and unsettling and maybe destabilizing for Putin,"" Herbst said, ""but he\'s betting that they\'re not, and if his bet is right, then that he\'s smart to keep all of his most effective troops in Donbas.""', '""But if he\'s wrong about that, then, of course, it\'s a mistake, and there are signs that he may be wrong about it. The thing about an authoritarian state like Russia is that it seems stable, stable, stable, and suddenly it\'s falling apart.""', 'The U.S. along with many other countries, particularly those in the European Union, have been providing Ukraine with military, financial and humanitarian aid throughout the war. Reuters reported that Ukraine has also been receiving Indian munitions transferred by European partners.', 'From January 2022 through June 2024, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with over $80 billion in assistance, most of it in military aid according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German-based research institution. ', 'Russia has been receiving ammunition from North Korea and close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. Belarus has also cooperated with Russia during the war, allowing them to stage their assault on Kyiv from its borders. ', '""What becomes important is more,"" Jones said, referring to the ongoing need for munitions. ""You just need more. They\'re used every day. The Russians keep coming. And so the longer this war goes on, it\'s an insatiable appetite that the Ukrainians and the Russians are going to have in a war of attrition. It\'s the sad reality.""', '""We know that both sides have had problems with supply,"" former Ambassador Herbst told USA TODAY. ""We know that Russia is being supplied with artillery and ammunition from North Korea in large quantities, although of questionable quality. And we also know that the West in general, including the United States, has learned, as Moscow has conducted this major war against Ukraine, that we ourselves do not have enough ammunition.""', '""There\'s been talk by the administration, there\'s been talk by Republicans in Congress, about doing something about this, but the action has been little, not just in connection with supplying Ukraine, but for us to be prepared for standoffs with either Russia or China,"" said Herbst.', '""This is a serious issue which transcends Ukraine.

According to Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight, the arsenal stored 122-millimeter rockets, 82-millimeter mortar bombs and 7.62-millimeter ammunition for rifles and machine guns.', 'But it‚Äôs also possible the arsenal contained stocks of much more powerful and rare weapons. Official sources told RBC-Ukraine these stocks included S-300 air-defense missiles and Iskander and KN-23 ballistic missiles‚Äîthe latter made by North Korea. The Russians use the S-300s, Islanders and KN-23s to bombard Ukrainian cities and electrical infrastructure from hundreds of miles away.', 'That so many of Russia‚Äôs best munitions were reportedly concentrated in a single location explains why Ukraine devoted such a large force to the attack. RBC-Ukraine claimed more than 100 drones were involved‚Äîpotentially making the Toropets raid the biggest Ukrainian strike on a target inside Russia since Russia widened its war on Ukraine 30 months ago.', '‚ÄúWithout exaggeration, this is a very significant achievement,‚Äù Frontelligence Insight explained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre likely looking at the loss of thousands of tons of explosive materials, shells and rockets.‚Äù', 'The most optimistic scenario for Russia is that only a few ballistic missiles were at Toropets‚Äîand any that were lost can eventually be replaced, perhaps by that initial batch of missiles coming from Iran. The worst case for Russia is that it just lost a significant portion of its best munitions for attacks deep inside Ukraine.', 'For Ukraine, the Toropets raid could represent a turning point. For many months, officials in Kyiv have pleaded with their European and American counterparts for permission to use donated long-range munitions‚ÄîBritish Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG cruise missiles and American Army Tactical Missile System rockets‚Äîon targets deep inside Russia, including munitions stockpiles.', 'But the Europeans and Americans have consistently withheld that permission, even as the civilian death toll from Russia‚Äôs own deep strikes has mounted.', 'Clearly frustrated, the Ukrainians have doubled down on the production of locally-developed weapons‚Äîdrones and missiles‚Äîthat they can fire at targets inside Russia without asking anyone‚Äôs permission first.', 'In blowing up the Toropets arsenal, those homemade weapons may have struck their biggest blow yet‚Äîand saved potentially scores of Ukrainian lives by preventing future Russian attacks. ‚ÄúA very important result was achieved,‚Äù Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelensky said just hours after Toropets exploded.', '', 'Sources:', '1. Reuters', '2. Frontelligence Insight', '3. RBC-Ukraine', '4.

According to Russian state media, the attack was so intense the town of Toropets had to be evacuated.', 'The Tver attack follows another showy Ukrainian operation on Russian soil: August‚Äôs shock offensive into Russia‚Äôs Kursk region that has captured about 500 square miles of territory. Both are likely efforts by Ukraine to put itself in a better position to end Russia‚Äôs two-and-a-half-year war, which has devastated parts of the country ‚Äî particularly in the south and east. While no peace talks are currently scheduled, Ukraine‚Äôs strategy could theoretically put it in a stronger negotiating position should talks happen, while also damaging Russia‚Äôs morale, ability to resupply, and its ability to launch devastating strikes within Ukraine.', 'Ukraine has long argued it could achieve more battlefield victories if the Biden administration would allow the military to use US-made long-range weapons to strike targets further in Russia.', 'The Tver strike and the Kursk incursion are likely meant to send a signal to allies that despite the war grinding on, Ukraine isn‚Äôt beaten, and that its allies aren‚Äôt backing a lost cause. That‚Äôs especially important in the leadup to the November US election, when a change in the White House could affect US political and material support for Ukraine, as former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates have signaled a coolness to continued material support for the war effort.', 'Essentially, Ukraine‚Äôs message is: We‚Äôre doing well in the fight against Russia, and would do even better with more advanced weapons. However, despite Ukraine‚Äôs flashy successes since the Kursk offensive, it‚Äôs unclear ‚Äî and possibly unlikely ‚Äî that the Biden administration will give Ukraine both the materiel and the go-ahead to use it the way they want.', 'The target of the drone attack, according to Ukrainian sources cited in reporting, was a weapons depot that held conventional weapons like artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Those weapons, as well as the fuel tanks reportedly stored at the depot, could account for the explosive visuals being circulated on Telegram, a favorite platform for Russian military bloggers.', 'Experts note that though the Tver attack has attracted attention due to the size of the explosion, it‚Äôs not an isolated strike: ‚ÄúUkrainian forces are conducting a consistent drone strike campaign into rear areas of Russia, targeting oil refineries and military airfields, military ammunition depots, and logistics facilities,‚Äù Riley Bailey, a senior researcher on Russia at the Institute for the Study of War, told Vox. ‚ÄúThis one just seems to be very effective.‚Äù', 'The successful drone attacks, Bailey said, could disrupt Russian military logistics within Russia ‚Äî as longer-range Ukrainian missile attacks did against Russian military installations within Ukraine in summer 2022. Disrupting logistics and resupply within Russia could, over time, hamper Russia‚Äôs ability to defend itself from attacks on its own soil; mount offensive campaigns within Ukraine; and force the military to rebuild and rearrange its supply capabilities.', '‚ÄúIf there was this persistent threat of Ukrainian forces being able to achieve similar effects at several logistics facilities like this, then that would impose the same kind of operational pressure that Russian forces faced back in the summer of 2022,‚Äù Bailey said.', 'Ukraine has always been outgunned and outmanned against Russia; without continued US and NATO support, the Ukrainian military can‚Äôt continue to fight. But, Ukrainian leadership has long argued, they could do much more significant damage to Russian supplies and strategy if the US allowed them to use long-range weapons to hit targets deep into Russian territory.', 'The apparently successful Tver attack comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to present his victory plan to US President Joe Biden during a visit to the US later in September. Though details are scarce, that plan seems intent on using military force to push Russia into negotiations to end the war. A pillar of the plan likely depends on continued weapons support and looser permissions around how those weapons are used. The US has been hesitant to grant those permissions in order to not be seen as directly involved or escalating the conflict ‚Äî and therefore inviting Russia to do the same.', 'However, fears about escalation haven‚Äôt played out on the battlefield, Amb. William Courtney, an adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, told Vox.', '‚ÄúRussian reaction, generally, has not been to escalate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been to adapt and try to counter.‚Äù', 'But even if the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer-range missiles in its arsenal to attack Russian positions, it might not have a major impact, according to Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities.', '‚ÄúThere are not that many Russian military targets in range of even the longer range missiles with additional permissions, and Russia can move valuable assets elsewhere, further reducing any losses from Ukrainian strikes,‚Äù she said. Plus, Ukraine wouldn‚Äôt be able to get enough of those weapons to mount the kind of sustained attacks that would make a long-term difference in the war.', 'Still, Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its strategy and hoping that the Biden administration gets on board with the plan for victory ‚Äî and that even if long-range capabilities aren‚Äôt the key to winning the war, they‚Äôll at least make Russia‚Äôs war increasingly difficult and costly to execute.', 'YOU‚ÄôVE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.
