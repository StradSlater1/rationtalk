He’s hard-working. He’s willing to take risks.”', 'When he ran for governor in 2022, ""a big part of Shapiro’s appeal to voters was that he had taken on Trump and election deniers,"" Frosh added.

Harris race puts two competing ideas of Christianity on display', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will no longer seek re-election in November, the 2024 presidential race juxtaposes two very different versions of Christianity: Donald Trump brandishes a performative rendition of the Christian faith as a political prop to advance authoritarian theocracy, while Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to take his place as the Democratic nominee, practices the Christian faith she was raised in, while embracing her interfaith family. ', 'In doing so, Harris embodies our nation’s founding ideal of religious freedom and models a Christian commitment to religious pluralism. ', 'Although he has reportedly mocked his conservative Christian leaders behind their backs, was not active in church before running for president and says he’s never asked God for forgiveness, Trump has manufactured mass far-right devotion among his base through moves like overturning Roe v. Wade. Surviving an assassination attempt will only heighten MAGA zealotry, as we saw with the surge of Christian nationalist narrative claiming Trump survived only by the will of God. ', 'Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church.', 'Harris grew up attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. “I was raised to live my faith,” she said at the National Baptist Convention, USA, Annual Meeting in 2022. “Marching for civil rights, my parents pushed me in a stroller. That was faith in action.” I’ve witnessed her put her faith in action on the national stage. Four days after Biden picked her to be his running mate in 2020, I was invited by the Biden-Harris campaign to attend a meeting between her and national faith leaders. We heard directly from the Rev. Dr. Amos Brown, her pastor at Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. It was clear from the very beginning of her national political career that she would not shy away from talking about her Baptist convictions. Harris once served as Rev. Brown’s campaign manager when he ran for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. “She is an encourager; she encourages all people regardless of their social station in life,” Rev. Brown shared with Baptist news outlet Word&Way. “She is a role model for womanhood, and just human decency and dignity at its best.” ', 'Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. “Just think, after slavery was outlawed in our country, the founders of this very convention came together to protect the freedom of worship,” she said at the National Baptist Convention. “As Black people in our nation battled racist laws and ideologies, men and women of the cloth were the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in America. And they, then, following the teachings of Christ, built coalitions of people of all faiths and races and walks of life, because they understood and knew the importance of the collective.”', '“I can trace my belief in the importance of public service back to learning the parable of the good Samaritan and other biblical teachings about looking out for our neighbors,” she said in a Religion News Service interview in 2020. ', '“Ever since I was a girl, church has not only been a place where I draw strength, it’s been a place for reflection, a place to study the teachings of the Lord and to feel grounded in a complex world,” she told RNS. “Church still plays that role for me. And I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need.”', 'Harris grew up in an interfaith family and chose to form an interfaith family as an adult. Her mother, an immigrant from India, took her to visit Hindu temples growing up. Harris has said this teaches her “to see that all faiths teach us to pursue justice.” If elected, Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff wouldn’t just be the first person to hold the title of first gentleman. He’d also the first Jewish spouse of a president. ', ""Must reads from Today's list"", '“From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” Harris said about the Hindu and Jewish influences in her life. ', 'Emhoff has also been a leader in the Biden-Harris administration at fostering interfaith dialogue and collaboration. I heard him speak at an interfaith iftar at the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2022 during Ramadan. Harris and Emhoff hosted an Eid al-Adha celebration in 2023, the first Eid celebration at the vice president’s residence. ', 'One of the most exciting aspects of Harris’ potential candidacy is that she doesn’t shy away from making the religious case for abortion rights, meeting head on Trump’s alliance of Christian nationalist groups pushing to outlaw abortion on so-called religious claims. ', 'Harris spoke on this matter at the National Baptist Convention:', '“As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And she will choose, in consultation with her pastor or her priest, or a doctor and her loved ones. But the government should not be making that decision.”', 'Harris’ boldness is representative, as most Christians in the United States support abortion rights. ', 'In 2021, Rev. Lauren Jones Mayfield was invited to the White House to participate in a roundtable discussion on reproductive health care with Harris. “Harris honored my religious voice as I intended for her to hear it, a deep valuing of American religious liberty and reproductive freedoms,” Jones Mayfield told me. “The vice president made clear her own support for reproductive health for all Americans alongside her ongoing commitments to religious liberty. For those of us who engage in reproductive rights activism of our faith, not in spite of it, Harris honored our collective, clerical voice that celebrates the American right for a patient to choose their best course of medical treatment with their doctor, family and faith leader if it’s so desired.”', 'Rooted in the Black Church tradition, deeply informed and inspired by her interfaith family, and a trailblazer for reproductive freedom, Kamala Harris’ Christian faith is the antithesis of Donald Trump’s Christian nationalism, in which the Christian faith is wielded as a tool to oppress, exclude and limit basic rights of people who believe or pray differently. ', 'If elected president, she would make history on multiple fronts: the first female president, the second Black president, and the first president of South Asian descent. She’ll also be a role model for confidently living out your faith in public while respecting others’ religious values.', 'Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons is a religion contributor and the author of ""Just Faith: Reclaiming Progressive Christianity.""', ""Catch up on more stories from MSNBC Daily featuring the top voices and opinions driving today's conversation"", '© 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Josh Shapiro has emerged as a top contender for the vice-presidential nod following President Joe Biden’s stunning announcement that he is dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing Kamala Harris to take his spot on the ballot.', 'Shapiro, 51, was elected Pennsylvania’s governor in 2022 and assumed office in January 2023. He is a moderate Democrat whose career trajectory has seen him move from congressional aide to Pennsylvania’s chief executive, all within two decades.', 'Already, top elected Democrats in Pennsylvania like state House Speaker Joanna McClinton and party leaders like Philadelphia Democratic chair Bob Brady have endorsed Shapiro as a possible vice presidential pick, citing his wins in a divided General Assembly and electoral success in a key swing state.', 'At a Monday afternoon event in Pittsburgh, Shapiro said he has spoken to both Biden and Harris, but declined to say whether he is in talks to join the ticket.', '“We spoke only about defeating Donald Trump and our shared commitment to that. I immediately gave her my endorsement and said I would do everything in my power to support her here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said of his Sunday conversation with Harris.', ""He added, “This is a deeply personal decision that the vice president will make. She will make it on her own timetable and her own timeline. She needs to choose someone that she's prepared to govern with, campaign with, and someone that she feels most comfortable with, and that decision should be made free of any sort of political pressure.”"", 'Unlike other rumored picks, like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Shapiro did not rule out the idea of running for vice president during the Monday event.', 'If Shapiro were to be tapped as a vice presidential candidate, he would be able to campaign while simultaneously serving as governor.', 'Email address', 'SIGN UP', '', '', '', 'The son of a pediatrician and educator who grew up in Philadelphia’s suburbs, Shapiro initially planned to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. But a few months into his freshman year at Rochester University, he nearly flunked his organic chemistry class. Around the same time, his dream of playing college basketball was shattered when he was cut from the university’s basketball team.', 'A knock on his dorm room door not long after would end up launching his career in public service, and later, politics: It was a fellow student, asking him if he would run for student government. He did — and won.', 'He hasn’t lost a bid for public office since.', 'In his 20s, he worked as a congressional aide on Capitol Hill while also getting his law degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.', 'In 2004, he ran for a seat representing Montgomery County in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives. He won, and remained in the state House for four two-year terms, during which he came to be known as a policy wonk and, later, a strategist who helped Democrats cement a razor-thin voting advantage in the chamber.', 'His first statewide run for office came in 2016 when he launched his successful campaign to helm the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, which had just come off four tumultuous and scandal-plagued years under Democratic predecessor Kathleen Kane.', 'He ran for governor in 2022 against a Trump-endorsed candidate, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin). Shapiro cast the race as a referendum on preserving democracy and constitutionally protected freedoms, including the right to abortion.', 'Again, Shapiro handily won the election and, in the process, shattered records for the most money ever spent on a governor’s race in Pennsylvania.', 'Shapiro, an observant Conservative Jew, has frequently said that his faith played prominently into his decision to enter public service.', 'Many of Shapiro’s key achievements came while he was Pennsylvania’s attorney general.', 'His office investigated the role of pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors in the nation’s opioid crisis, and prosecuted natural gas companies.', 'But his legacy there was irrevocably shaped by his office’s scathing grand jury report on child sexual abuse and its coverup in nearly every Roman Catholic diocese in Pennsylvania. The investigation — which Kane, his predecessor, had initiated — sparked similar inquiries across the nation and landed Shapiro on television screens across the globe.', 'As attorney general, Shapiro positioned himself as a foil to the values and policies of Trump and his administration.', 'He joined other Democratic attorneys general in suing the administration over its family-separation policy for migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border; and over a rule that would have allowed employers more leeway in denying birth control coverage mandates under the Affordable Care Act.', 'Shapiro’s office was also the one in court defending Pennsylvania’s election results, which came under attack by Trump and his surrogates in the weeks after Trump’s loss to Biden in the 2020 election.', 'Less than two weeks after Shapiro took office as governor, he had to contend with a crisis when a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, less than a mile from Pennsylvania’s border, and released thousands of tons of toxic chemicals.', 'Then, amid state budget talks, an overpass on I-95 suddenly collapsed after a truck fire. The bridge was used by tens of thousands of Philadelphia commuters every day, and its failure required Shapiro to coordinate a temporary replacement in less than two weeks while under national scrutiny.', 'The speed with which the highway was rebuilt, and Shapiro’s visibility during the project — hovering over the collapse in a helicopter, setting up a construction live stream, holding enthusiastic media briefings — won him national attention.', 'As governor, Shapiro has negotiated two budgets with Pennsylvania’s divided state legislature — the only in the country — that dramatically increased funding for public education.', 'Budget negotiations during his first year in office were temporarily delayed after a politically embarrassing incident. As the June 30 deadline neared, the governor, according to multiple accounts, privately negotiated a deal with state Senate Republicans to create a taxpayer-funded school voucher plan. Democrats privately said they were blindsided by the move and refused to give their support to the proposal.', 'Despite Shapiro’s efforts to assuage members of his party, the governor was forced to abandon the plan.', 'Shapiro scored a major win in this year’s budget, securing $500 million for a program to prepare sites for industrial or mixed-use developments. Still, the final deal did not include several other key issues Shapiro advocated for, including sustainable funding for public transit and the legalization of adult-use recreational marijuana.', ""“There were some things we didn't get done this time,” Shapiro acknowledged during a news conference after signing the budget, “but in a productive democracy, this is how progress is made — by moving past partisan politics and having real conversations together.”"", 'One of the few controversies of Shapiro’s tenure as governor came courtesy of one of his oldest allies, his now-former legislative liaison Mike Vereb.', 'Shapiro and Vereb, a Republican, are both from Montgomery County and served together in the state House. When Shapiro became attorney general, he brought Vereb on as a top advisor. And when Shapiro was elected governor, Vereb was one of the few Republicans to join his staff, this time in a key role as the governor’s emissary to the legislature.', 'But in September, Vereb resigned. His departure came shortly after reporters had learned a staffer had filed a complaint against him alleging harassment that had begun shortly after the start of the administration.', 'Spotlight PA learned that the administration had quietly paid out $295,000 to settle the complaint three weeks before Vereb’s abrupt resignation. Shapiro would not discuss the matter in any detail, with his administration saying only that it handled the matter in a professional and timely manner.', 'That settlement isn’t the only matter about which Shapiro has been notably tight-lipped. Across the board, Shapiro’s administration has been markedly more opaque than previous governors’.', 'As Shapiro prepared to take office, he had members of his transition team sign nondisclosure agreements and would not say who paid for inauguration events.', 'Unlike his predecessor, who released detailed daily schedules, Shapiro has declined to regularly release information about who he meets with behind the scenes. He also categorizes his daily calendars as “personal” papers, which exempts them from the state’s Right-To-Know Law.', 'The governor also loosened a notoriously tight gift ban for his employees while arguing it would still protect against gifts from lobbyists influencing his agenda.', 'However, Shapiro has still accepted free tickets, including to the Super Bowl, paid for by unknown donors to a little-known fund managed by Team PA, a Harrisburg-based nonprofit of which the governor is a co-chair.', 'He also listed tickets to sporting events, from long-time donors and lobbyists, as campaign contributions.', 'The administration has argued this is all in compliance with the state’s ethics and campaign finance laws, which are among the most lax in the country, and that the gift ban doesn’t apply to Team PA.', 'Shapiro, one of the country’s most prominent Jewish politicians, has also taken a central role in condemning antisemitism and what he sees as weak responses to it in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people.', '“I am pro-the idea of a Jewish homeland, a Jewish state, and I will certainly do everything in my power to ensure that Israel is strong and Israel is fortified and will exist for generations,” Shapiro told the New York Times.', 'As protests against Israel’s war in Gaza — where the death toll now tops 39,000 — have escalated, Shapiro has argued some demonstrations have crossed a line into bigotry.', 'Amid rising protests against the war, the Shapiro administration updated the office’s code of conduct to bar “scandalous” conduct. An email accompanying the policy cited social media posts, boycotts, graffiti, and public confrontations as examples of potential “hate speech” that would not be tolerated.', 'He also backed a bipartisan bill that would strip state funding from any school that divests from Israel.', 'Before Biden announced he was stepping down, Shapiro, who has made many appearances as a surrogate for and supporter of Biden, said he stood by the president.', 'Soon after Biden announced he would not accept the nomination for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, Shapiro issued a statement giving her his full support.', '“I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results,” Shapiro said in a statement released by his campaign office.', '“Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom.

He is a tremendous campaigner, somebody who’s tireless in the way that he pursues an objective, both like an electoral goal, but even a policy one. And so objectively, I think the Governor Shapiro has to be the top of everyone’s list.”', 'Shapiro is not responding to questions about whether he would accept the offer if it was presented.

Jay Costa, a convention delegate, said the meeting took place at 1 p.m. Monday. Mr. Costa also said he doesn’t anticipate any other nationally known Democratic heavyweights will compete with Ms. Harris for the nomination, and he also expected support for Ms. Harris to be forthcoming from many other Democratic organizations in the state.', 'Mr. Costa, an Allegheny County resident and the top Democrat in the state Senate, said Ms. Harris is “the right person for the job” and was Democrats’ best option. Democrats in general, he said, have been lacking in enthusiasm for the presidential race and Mr. Biden’s endorsement of Ms. Harris “flipped the switch” on that dynamic overnight.', 'Reverberations from Mr. Biden’s weekend political bombshell were felt among state leaders Monday even as they continued to assess the aftermath of the attempted assassination the previous weekend of former President Donald Trump in Butler County. Prominent in the former topic and having a strong interest in the second topic was Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has been mentioned repeatedly as a possible running mate for Ms. Harris and even as a potential convention draftee pick for president.', 'A spokesperson for Mr. Shapiro, who is midway through his second year as governor, did not immediately provide answers to questions Monday morning. At an event in Pittsburgh later in the day, the governor demurred when asked about a possible national run, saying Ms. Harris has a ""deeply personal decision"" to make and that he wouldn’t “engage in hypotheticals.""', 'Top Republicans in the state Legislature criticized the notion of Mr. Shapiro seeking the vice presidency.', 'The Democratic governor previously served stints as state attorney general, state representative and Montgomery County commissioner.', 'Mr. Costa said the vice presidential slot was not discussed during the delegates’ meeting Monday.', 'Prior to the meeting, Mr. Costa said Mr. Shapiro had a “very successful record” as governor and “has the capability” to hold one of the national posts. Concerning the possibility of Mr. Shapiro being added to a potential ticket topped by Ms. Harris, Mr. Costa said, “He is one of a number of folks who are being considered.”', 'The mere fact that Mr. Shapiro is under consideration for a place on the ticket, Mr. Costa said, speaks well of how Pennsylvania has been run in the past 18 months. He ticked off many items worthy of praise in the just-completed state budget, led by the $1.1 billion increase in spending for K-12 education.', 'Other Democrats have praised deep involvement by his administration in the budget negotiations, which put a complete state spending plan in place four months earlier than last year. Mr. Shapiro is the only governor in the nation working with a divided state legislature, with the House controlled by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans.', 'In a midday news release, the Shapiro administration said that with the recent budget completion, Mr. Shapiro ""has proven once again that he can work with both parties to get stuff done and deliver real results for Pennsylvanians.""', 'Another top Democrat in Harrisburg, House Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, on Sunday issued a statement of thanks to Mr. Biden, whom he said “has served the nation honorably for decades with kindness, empathy, and decency.”', 'Mr. Bradford added that Mr. Biden “led the nation out of a very dark time, and his policies showed us the path out of a worldwide pandemic. He built an incredible economy, strengthened our infrastructure, and created a brighter future for working families.”', 'Top Republicans, asked about the potential involvement of Mr. Shapiro in a national ticket, lambasted the concept.', 'Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, R-Westmoreland, said Mr. Shapiro has been aiming at a spot in national politics ever since he was sworn in as governor. She said she didn’t see how Mr. Shapiro could run for a national office and still pay attention to Pennsylvania.', 'She said it has been “difficult to work with him” because of what Ms. Ward described as Mr. Shapiro’s repeatedly taking positions in order to avoid angering the extreme left of his party.', 'And even though Mr. Shapiro often highlights the fact he must work with a divided Legislature, Ms. Ward said it gives the governor cover when he does not want to support a bill from one side or the other. Asked if she trusted him, Ms. Ward said, “If he tells me he is going to do something, I don’t trust that.”', 'Rep. Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster and the minority leader in the House, said “there is a lot that the governor could be focusing on here, rather than nationally.” He said that even though this year’s budget was not nearly as late as the previous one, he believed Mr. Shapiro’s budget performance was “0 for 2” because the most recent one included what Mr. Cutler described as a complete elimination of the budget surplus.', 'On the Trump assassination attempt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, said Ms. McClinton was “confident that the FBI and Congress have the tools necessary for comprehensive investigations,” including the cooperation of Pennsylvania State Police and local law enforcement. Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for House Democratic Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, issued a similar statement.', 'Mr. Cutler, on the other hand, said he has introduced a resolution in the House to form a bipartisan committee to probe the actions of state and local law enforcement, as well as their coordination with federal agencies, on the day of the shooting.', '“Pennsylvania is a political battleground state that will be the epicenter of many high-level campaign events during the remainder of the 2024 election season,” Mr. Cutler said. “It is imperative we identify what happened from a state and local perspective on July 13, as we seek to perfect our effectiveness at keeping citizens and candidates safe as they host campaign events in Pennsylvania.”', 'Mr. Cutler noted a number of upcoming high-profile events in the state, including the NFL draft in Pittsburgh, soccer World Cup events in Philadelphia, and the nation’s 250th anniversary celebration.', 'Ms. Ward said “obviously, something went terribly wrong” and it was clear more security would need to be in place at future events.', 'Ford Turner: fturner@post-gazette.com', 'First Published: July 22, 2024, 12:02 p.m.\nUpdated: July 23, 2024, 8:04 a.m.']"

They also questioned the enduring usefulness of the two-party system and how the decision will affect Biden’s legacy in the history books."", 'Here are their answers:', '“I think they’re both awful. I think Trump’s awful, I think the state of American politics is just beyond salvageable. Harris running is going to make sure Trump’s a winner. Harris is very inexperienced, she doesn’t have any foreign policy credentials. I just don’t think she’s up to the task. There were a lot of people who were on the fence that are going to now vote for Trump because Harris isn’t qualified. And just so you know, I’m a Nikki Haley fan.”', '“I think it’s what was required for us to move forward and have Donald Trump not be president. Biden was just getting too old and we need some younger people in there. Trump’s too old himself. I’m not sure if she’s strongest but I don’t know what else they could do at this point in time.”', '“I feel positive. I would have voted for Biden, but I definitely feel he’s declined in the past year. A lot of people say, ‘How come you now like Harris? You never see her?’ Well, if you don’t follow her you’re not on that algorithm, but she’s everywhere. She’s out talking to people, meeting people. She’s met world leaders. I feel really strongly that she does have a presence even if the ‘right’ obviously doesn’t follow her. I heard this morning that she already raised $50 million after Biden endorsed her, and we were behind after Trump’s assassination attempt, so that’s positive. But I think her VP pick will be crucial, and because there’s still misogyny in this country, I do feel like she should pick a man.”', '“Well, I’m kind of sorry because Harris probably has a chance now against Trump and I was hoping that Biden would stay in and then lose. I’ve lived in this country for 40 years, I went through the Reagan era, great prosperity, etc., then I went through Clinton and Obama and I see this country increasingly have problems, inflation, internationally, etc. Then when Trump came in, this country was doing great.”', 'William Bridges, 21, Durango', '“It’s kind of just like another day for me. It’s just Monday. There are a lot of challenges the Democrats still have to face, like not going through the nomination process democratically and having a cherry-picked candidate. But I think anyone who voted for Biden in 2020 probably thought that Kamala might get the presidency because Biden was old as (crap). I’m more of a leftist of the political spectrum so I think the current American two-party system doesn’t favor the American people.”', ""“I think it was time for Biden to step down, so I think he’s doing the right thing but I’m a little bit weary. I like Kamala Harris but I don't know if she's done anything that shows us she's presidential yet. We certainly haven't heard much about what she's done as vice president. I'm also not happy with what's going on with the border. I’m still waiting to see if they put up some other candidates to compete with her. I do like her, but I'm not sure if she's the one that's going to take us where we need to be as a country. I’m unaffiliated, so I don’t vote straight Democrat, but I definitely can’t vote for Trump based on what I’ve seen so far, and Project 2025 is terrifying.”"", '“We kind of saw it coming with all his stumbling around; seems like he’s close to senile anyway. I don’t think having Kamala Harris run could hurt (the Democrats) chances but it seems like they’re both different sides of the same coin. All the Democrats love women so I’m sure they’re going to eat that up, but I don’t know if everybody’s ready yet. I also don’t necessarily think it has to be a man or a woman, it should be whether they’re the right person for our country. It would be nice to have a woman but whether that should be Harris is hard to say considering how hard she was on crime in the beginning of her career and how hard she was on people.”', '“I’ve never met either personally, so I can only really conjecture based off what I’m shown by the media. But you can just see how they’re watering things down more and more, like look at Disney, with all the diverse characters now and everything like that at the cost of actual storytelling. It’s also taking place in politics, and Kamala Harris is the best example of that. It doesn’t need to be said but obviously this isn’t working, the two-party system is insane. It’s completely useless. Well, it’s not useless unless you want to create division and establish a culture of division like we have now.”', '“I feel like it’s kind of scary that it’s this close to the election. Maybe it will be hard for people to rally around her in the four short months that are left. I feel like Biden has honestly done a good job and she’s (Harris) been there alongside him but it’s just shaking things up too much with so little time left. ”', '“I think it was the right thing to do. As far as Harris coming in as the new nominee, well, nobody knows anything about her. She’s been in for four years and I’ve only heard her name a few times. One thing I do know about her is that she was in charge of the border wall and she did nothing, she didn’t even go down there. (Fact check: Harris visited the border in June 2021.) Hardcore Democrats are going to vote for her no matter what. But people on the fence? They don’t know enough about her and Trump gave such a great speech at the convention that I think was enough to swing people. Harris really could have been something. She was their (the Democrats) next superstar, but they didn’t groom her. These last four years they didn’t do anything with her.”', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'Choose from several print and digital subscription packages', 'Sign up for our daily email newsletter or to receive breaking news delivered to your inbox:', '© 2024 Durango Herald | Ballantine Communications, Inc.

Josh Shapiro gives his 2024 budget address at the Capitol in Harrisburg Feb. 6, 2024 (Commonwealth Media Services photo)', 'He’s only been Pennsylvania’s governor for a year and a half and just got his second state budget wrapped, but Josh Shapiro already had a national profile for some of the cases he prosecuted during his tenure as the state’s attorney general. ', 'Shapiro is one of the people considered most likely to join the Democrats’ 2024 ticket with President Joe Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday. He leads a critical battleground state with 19 electoral votes up for grabs. ', 'Shapiro had continued to support Biden publicly in the aftermath of the president’s poor performance in the June 27 presidential debate, saying the morning after on cable news morning shows that Democrats should “stop worrying” and “start working.” But that hasn’t stopped speculation — which Shapiro has largely dismissed — that he is destined for bigger things within the Democratic Party, whether it’s now or sometime in the near future. ', 'On Sunday, Shapiro released a statement praising Biden’s long career in politics. “President Biden is a patriot who has served our country honorably in the Senate, as Vice President, and as one of the most consequential presidents in modern history,” he said in a post to social media. “President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom. I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania — the Commonwealth that raised him.”', 'He later released a statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. “The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency,” Shapiro said. “The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania — where this collective work began. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.”', 'A Shapiro spokesman confirmed that the governor spoke with Harris on Sunday.', 'Rising from a state House seat representing his hometown of Abington to the governor’s mansion, Shapiro built a reputation for being a hard worker and a skilled negotiator. And he has projected those attributes onto his administration’s brand with the slogan “Get S**t Done.” ', '“He’s had 20 years of being in government and that’s a lot of experience,” Neil Oxman, who served as a consultant for Shapiro’s first campaign.', '', 'Shapiro touts simple achievements in state government such as cutting the time to register a new corporation from months to days and flipping the state’s reputation for lethargic government by reopening Interstate 95, a crucial mid-Atlantic artery, in 12 days after a gasoline tanker crash last June destroyed an overpass.', 'And he offers grand designs for the future of Pennsylvania by reforming the state’s system of higher education, expanding workforce training and development opportunities and reinventing the commonwealth’s energy economy to meet carbon reduction goals while recognizing the role the state’s fossil fuel industries will continue to play for the foreseeable future.', 'Berwood Yost, director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin & Marshall College, said Shapiro’s approval ratings, his 2022 gubernatorial election win by a 15% margin, and record as attorney general all make him one of the most recognized political figures in the key swing states for Democrats.', '“People view him as  … a moderate commonsense Democrat who tries to get things done,” Yost said, adding that his profile among Democratic leaders is also strong.', '“People wouldn’t be mentioning his name if he hadn’t already generated some buzz,” Yost said. “His brand is undoubtedly strong, particularly within the party, but it has the potential to be appealing to a broader swath of voters.”', 'Shapiro was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2004 and served there until 2011. During his first tenure in Harrisburg, Shapiro demonstrated acumen for forging compromise. He helped to negotiate a play to put Rep. Denny O’Brien, a Republican backed by a reform-minded alliance of Democratic and GOP lawmakers, on the speaker’s rostrum in 2007.', 'In doing so, Shapiro helped knock Rep. John Perzel, a Philadelphia GOP boss later convicted of using state resources for campaigns, from the speaker’s seat. O’Brien named Shapiro a co-chair of the newly formed Speaker’s Committee on Reform.', 'After three terms in the House, Shapiro returned to Montgomery County, where he was elected to oversee a financially distressed government. According to his campaign biography, Shapiro erased a $10 million deficit and simplified the county’s investments to rescue its half-billion-dollar retirement fund.', 'It was as the state’s attorney general, however, that Shapiro began to draw national and international headlines. In 2018 he released the results of a grand jury investigation that alleged widespread abuse of 1,000 children by some 300 “predator priests” in six of Pennsylvania’s eight Roman Catholic dioceses. In a scathing report, Shapiro said church leaders engaged in a “systematic cover up” over the course of eight decades to protect the institution, transferring abusers from one parish to another without disclosing their prior acts. ', '', 'Shapiro opposed proposals by the dioceses to establish victims’ compensation funds, noting that the grand jury recommended lifting or creating exceptions to the criminal and civil statutes of limitations for abuse and saying that the church should not be “the arbiter of its own punishment.” While the legislature eliminated the criminal statute of limitations for abuse, it has been unable to complete legislation to allow older victims to sue their abusers and those who enabled them. Within a year of the report’s release, the dioceses paid $84 million to settle claims by 564 victims. ', 'And he sued former President Donald Trump’s administration some two dozen times, including in 2019, to challenge a “gag rule” imposing restrictions on participants in the Title X family planning program.', 'Shapiro also brokered a 2019 deal between two western Pennsylvania healthcare giants, UPMC and Highmark, who were at odds over terms to allow Highmark-insured patients to receive in-network care at UPMC facilities. Shapiro accused UPMC, the largest healthcare system in western Pennsylvania, of violating the state’s public charities law and of unfair trade practices. The two sides signed a 10-year agreement allowing patients to keep access to each other’s services just days before the previous agreement expired. ', 'Shapiro’s 2022 run for governor came the same cycle that Democrat John Fetterman ran for the state’s open Senate seat, in an election year when candidates aligned with Trump fared relatively poorly. The U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade just a few months prior, was galvanizing for many Democrats, and Shapiro’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), was and is staunchly anti-abortion. ', '', 'Mastriano, a retired U.S. Army colonel from south-central Pennsylvania, ran on a far-right platform in which he advocated restricting abortion access and cutting public school funding. He also promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic. ', 'Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said Shapiro’s campaign zeroed in on Mastriano’s weaknesses early in the campaign and didn’t let up. He also received endorsements from more than a dozen high-profile Republicans including former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Pennsylvania Congressmen Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood.', '“It was a textbook on campaigns that didn’t deviate from their game plan,” Borick said, adding that Shapiro is disciplined in his messaging and style. “He doesn’t make a lot of unforced errors in his politics.”', 'His tenure as governor has not been without controversy. The first budget Shapiro negotiated, with a GOP-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House, was delayed nearly six months, as a protracted battle over school vouchers simmered through the summer into the fall. Senate Republicans blamed Shapiro for failing to secure the support of House Democrats, who killed the $100 million program. ', 'Last August, Shapiro’s office paid $295,000 in public funds to settle a state employee’s sexual harassment complaint against his longtime aide and former Legislative Affairs Secretary Mike Vereb. The terms of the agreement came to light last October. ', 'With the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin crucial to winning the presidential election, both the Biden and Trump campaigns have spent significant time and resources in the Keystone State, with only a few points separating the two in recent polls. However, following the June 27 debate, a growing number of Democrats called for Biden to step down from the ticket, in favor of  Harris or another candidate, like Shapiro. ', '', 'A July 18 survey by Public Policy Polling found a Democratic ticket of Harris/Shapiro ahead of Trump and his running mate U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance by one point, while the Biden-Harris ticket trailed the GOP team by about four points. A Quinnipiac University poll in January found Shapiro with a 59% approval rating, well ahead of the 40% approval rating Biden had in the same poll. And in a 2022 Muhlenberg poll of a hypothetical presidential election between Shapiro and Trump, the governor led by 11% among Pennsylvania voters.', '“His resume is stellar for taking that next step,” Yost, of Franklin & Marshall said. “We just don’t know what that would look like.”', 'If Shapiro were to stand as a choice for the presidential nomination in an open Democratic convention, he would be an attractive choice, he added.', '“He would be one of the leading candidates just given his record and the necessity of winning Pennsylvania for Democrats and his ability to appeal to the middle in the way his opponent, if he were to run against Trump, has struggled with,” Yost said.', 'And although voters in Arizona or Wisconsin might never have heard his name, Shapiro’s brand of politics is well suited for a national audience, Borick said.', '“Pennsylvania … is a swing state for a reason,” Borick said. “It has one of the largest rural populations in the nation, it has large urban populations and booming suburbs. It mirrors the national landscape of American life.”', 'Update: This story was updated Sunday July 21, 2024 at 3 p.m. after President Joe Biden announced he was bowing out of his reelection bid, again at 6:30 p.m with Shapiro’s statement endorsing Kamala Harris for president, and at 10 p.m. to add that Shapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday.', 'SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.', 'Our stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Abbott, who at the time was a spokesman for then-Gov. Tom Wolf.', ""Just days after he took office in 2017, Shapiro was part of the coalition of state attorneys general who opposed Trump's proposed travel ban on people entering the country from Muslim-majority countries."", ""And as Trump left office four years later, Shapiro was heavily involved in efforts to push back against the many lawsuits questioning Biden's victory, including in Pennsylvania itself."", '“We did a lot of work together on a lot of different cases,” Brian Frosh, a Democrat who was Maryland’s attorney general at the time, said of Shapiro. “He’s very smart, very capable. He’s hard-working. He’s willing to take risks.”', 'When he ran for governor in 2022, ""a big part of Shapiro’s appeal to voters was that he had taken on Trump and election deniers,"" Frosh added. Shapiro\'s Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, was himself an election denier who had traveled to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.', ""Frosh said Shapiro's investigation of sex abuse allegations against the Catholic Church was a blueprint for his own probe in Maryland."", ""Shapiro is just one example of how politicians have used the previously sleepy position of attorney general in recent years to catapult themselves into high-profile political careers. Other examples include Harris herself, who was attorney general of California. The approach has worked for Republicans, too, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who were their states' attorneys general."", 'The easiest way for newly appointed attorneys general to make names for themselves these days is simple: generate national headlines by opposing the president in high-profile litigation.', 'That is exactly the approach Shapiro took.', 'He helped coordinate Democratic attorneys general as they supported lawsuits against the travel ban filed by attorneys general in Washington state and Virginia.', 'Democrats loudly condemned Trump\'s policy, saying in part that it discriminated on the basis of religion by targeting Muslims. The ban was implemented after Trump pledged during the campaign to implement ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.""', 'At the time, the newly elected Shapiro brushed off concerns that joining the legal effort could harm him politically in a state Trump had won in the 2016 election.', '""This filing is about keeping our communities safe, protecting our economy, and upholding the rule of law,"" Shapiro said in a statement announcing the filing of one of the briefs against the travel ban.', ""Courts blocked Trump's initial travel ban, allowing Shapiro and the other attorneys general to claim victory. (Trump later issued an amended travel ban, which Shapiro decided against challenging. It was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.)"", 'Shapiro, whose office declined to comment on his role as attorney general, continued to butt heads with Trump.', ""One lawsuit he helped lead targeted a Trump administration effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act's so-called contraception mandate, which required employers to ensure that health insurance plans covered contraceptives. The administration issued a regulation that expanded religious and moral exemptions from the requirement."", 'The Supreme Court in 2020 ruled in favor of Trump on a 7-2 vote.', 'Shapiro found himself in the national spotlight again later that year as Trump and fellow Republicans fought in court both before and after the November election over voting-related issues.', ""One element of the pro-Trump election-denier narrative centered on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots to be received in the battleground state in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The move was backed by Democrats, including Shapiro."", 'The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in October 2020 declined to intervene in Pennsylvania at the request of Republicans, but that did not stop the idea that Democrats had run roughshod over elections laws from taking hold on the right.', ""That led to a lawsuit Texas filed later in the year seeking to invalidate Biden's election wins in key swing states, including Pennsylvania."", 'At the request of Shapiro and other state attorneys general, the Supreme Court quickly rejected that lawsuit, too.', '""Our nation\'s highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process,"" Shapiro said at the time.', 'His involvement in the 2020 election cases ""just solidified him as the Democratic front-runner and favorite"" for the 2022 governor\'s race, said David La Torre, a Republican consultant in the state.', '""It certainly did him no harm,"" he added.', 'This article was originally published on NBCNews.com', '']"
