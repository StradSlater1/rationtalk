Katy Perry’s ‘143’: All 11 Songs Ranked,https://www.billboard.com/lists/katy-perry-143-songs-ranked/,"[""See how Billboard ranks every song on Katy Perry's follow-up to 2020's 'Smile.'"", 'By Rania Aniftos', 'Katy Perry is having fun again. “I was frozen, I was hopeless/ Now there’s poetry in every moment,” she sings in the mid-album reflection track, “All the Love.”', 'Perry’s been open about her struggles with mental health over the past few years, especially after the tepid critical and commercial reaction to her 2017 LP, Witness. “After being on a rocket ship and just going straight up, it was just a small change in the trajectory, but it felt seismic,” the pop star explained back in 2020, noting that thanks to medication and therapy, she was able to fuel her creative side once more.', 'She also has a lot more love in her life these days. Her husband Orlando Bloom remains her biggest fan and supporter, and the couple welcomed daughter Daisy Dove together in August 2020. That family unit inspired 2020’s Smile, which featured songs like “Daisies,” “Never Really Over” and “Harleys in Hawaii,” as well as a much smilier Perry.', 'After years of inner work, Perry unveiled her sixth studio album, 143, on Friday (Sept. 20). “I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,” Perry previously shared in a statement about 143, which is text message code for “I love you.”', 'The album is characteristically Katy Perry, something her beloved fans, the KatyKats, are sure to enjoy. The entire project is boosted with serotonin, as Perry belts about being in love with her partner, her family, herself and her life all over breezy, synth-driven beats. She’s healing and she’s not taking life too seriously, and after a wild few years, it’s great to see the pop star be herself again.', 'While all of 143 is worth listening to, there are some clear early standouts. Here is a ranking of all 11 tracks on Katy Perry’s latest album.', 'In the midst of an album boosted with fun, “All the Love” serves as a sweet, reflective moment of her journey to Orlando Bloom. It’s a classic pop song, something Perry is a pro at creating, but it pales in comparison to the rest of the vividly colorful album.', '“I’ve never been clearer, I’m at peace with moving on,” Perry sings on the penultimate 143 track. While the song is about a potentially unfaithful lover, the aforementioned sentiment rings true for the whole album. Despite some hurtful bumps along Perry’s career, she’s at a place where she’s ready to move on from the negativity and be herself. While “Truth” isn’t necessarily one of the most exciting songs on 143, the message is something everyone needs to hear.', 'Perry loves a steamy club track, and “Nirvana” is just that. Complete with a thumping beat and repeated “ah-oohs” throughout the track, “Nirvana” feels exactly what the title suggests.', 'While “Woman’s World” serves as the lead single and almost a theme song to the rest of the project, it’s hard to look past the idea that a female empowerment track was produced by Dr. Luke, who was in a years-long legal battle with Kesha over an alleged sexual assault. (Luke denied the allegations and countersued for defamation; the legal battle ended in 2023 with the two parties settling the countersuit out of court.) However, without the deeper analysis, “Woman’s World” has a strong, memorable hook that will surely be a staple in Perry’s tours to come.', 'Perry proclaims she’s “living in a candy daydream” to open “Crush,” and that sentiment rings true for the rest of the dopamine-injected track. She’s having fun and she’s in love, which you can hear in the song’s anthemic, radio-ready chorus as well as the entire album.', 'There’s nothing like a powerful pop female team-up. Kim and Katy’s vocals are so complimentary to each other, and they both love to pump up female confidence — it’s a shock they haven’t collaborated before.', 'While the vast majority of 143 is summer-ready pop, “Artificial” provides a nice mid-album switch-up. The R&B-infused track features a rapid-fire verse from JID and a darker chorus about a dangerous, almost non-human affair. “Artificial” is the perfect yin to the rest of the album’s yang, which makes it an easy standout on the project.', '“Lifetimes” is the ultimate track for a beach club in the Mediterranean, hence why she filmed the breezy music video in Ibiza. The ecstatic, romantic theme of “Lifetimes” as well was the synth-filled chorus is a recipe for a longtime summer staple, and will surely get remixes from worldwide DJs in the future to continue its own lifetime.', 'While 143 is fun and lighthearted throughout, Perry brings the message to a heartfelt place for the album’s closer. With “Wonder,” Perry speaks directly to her four-year-old daughter Daisy — who makes a sweet appearance singing the chorus at the end — asking her to keep the freespirited, wild heart that she currently possesses. “Can somebody promise me/ Our innocence doesn’t get lost in this cynical world?” she sings as a worried mother who perhaps lost her own “wonder” at times along the way. However, with a mom like Katy Perry, it’s safe to say Daisy Dove’s journey to adulthood will be a good one.', '“Gimme Gimme” is the type of pop in which Perry thrives: the sultry beat, the tongue-in-cheek lyrics and a braggadocious verse from one of today’s most prominent rappers. It’s reminiscent of some of Perry’s best hits, including “Dark Horse” and “E.T.,” and represents everything Perry’s fan’s love about her: she’s sexy, she’s not afraid of getting a little raunchy with her lyrics, she knows how to get you on the dance floor and she sure can sing.', 'It’s a shame that summer has wrapped up, because the nostalgic collab, which features a heavy lift from Crystal Waters’ ’90s dance-pop hit “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless),” is the perfect sunshine-drenched track. From the retro beat and chanting chorus to the ethereal harmonies and Doechii’s smooth verses, “I’m His, He’s Mine” is the standout track from 143, and hopefully a fan-favorite for years to come.', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2024 Billboard Media, LLC.

Katy Perry’s New Album “143” Misses the Mark,https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/entertainment/katy-perrys-new-album-143-misses-the-mark/,"['', '', 'September 20, 2024 Staff Reporter Entertainment 0', '', 'Katy Perry’s latest album, 143, is meant to evoke feelings of love, with the title representing the number of letters in “I love you.”', 'However, the album feels more like “144”—“I made mush.” Perry’s first full-length project since 2020’s Smile falls flat, offering an 11-track collection dominated by heavy electronic beats and uninspired lyrics, lacking the charm and personality that once defined her work.', 'The album’s rollout was rocky from the start. Perry faced backlash for collaborating with controversial producer Dr. Luke, and her music video for Woman’s World was met with criticism for its confusing attempt at satire. To add to the troubles, her video shoot for Lifetimes on a Spanish beach sparked an investigation into potential environmental damage.', 'Musically, 143 doesn’t deliver much beyond mediocrity. The first three singles—Woman’s World, Lifetimes, and I’m His, He’s Mine (featuring Doechii)—fall short of expectations. Woman’s World offers an attempt at an arena-pop anthem with a Lady Gaga flavor, while Lifetimes feels like a recycled Calvin Harris track from the 2010s. Meanwhile, I’m His, He’s Mine lazily samples Crystal Waters’ 1991 hit Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless), lacking originality or punch.', 'Tracks like Gimme Gimme, featuring 21 Savage, attempt to bring some edge but come across more as simplistic nursery rhymes, particularly with lyrics such as “Say the right thing, maybe you can be/Crawling on me, like a centipede.” The collaboration with Kim Petras on Gorgeous is marred by odd production choices, including a persistent squeaky toy sound that detracts from the song’s message of empowerment.', '', '', 'One of the few redeeming moments comes with Crush, which, while decent, is built on repetitive synths reminiscent of ’90s European disco tracks. Unfortunately, many of the tracks produced by Dr. Luke, including All the Love, feature similarly unsophisticated production and repetitive lyrics. In All the Love, the phrase “back to me” is repeated 23 times in just over three minutes, highlighting the lack of lyrical depth throughout the album.', 'Truth includes a line that perhaps sums up the entire album: “My intuition’s telling me things ain’t right.” Perry tries to incorporate a fake voicemail at the end of the song, a technique used more authentically by other artists. Here, it feels forced and lacks the emotional resonance found in more genuine uses of personal recordings.', 'Perry’s reliance on large songwriting teams is taken to an extreme on 143, with tracks like Nirvana credited to 12 writers—yet the result feels like a tired club track from the ’90s. The album closes with Wonder, a sugary-sweet ballad that awkwardly contrasts with the rest of the album, making a plea for innocence while attempting to tug at the heartstrings of her audience, particularly moms, as it references her daughter, Daisy.', 'Ultimately, 143 feels hollow, offering little substance or connection. While it tries to say “I love you,” it instead leaves listeners feeling indifferent, with an album that’s more about numbers than emotion.', 'Source: AP', '', '', '', 'In ""Entertainment""', '', 'In ""Entertainment""', '', 'In ""Entertainment""', '', '', '', '', '', 'published 44704 articles', 'Copyright © 2024 | The Zimbabwe Mail Online - Your News!

Katy Perry’s ‘143’ is a Failed Attempt to Rekindle Her Glory Years,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/katy-perry-143-review-1235108317/,"['BY MAURA JOHNSTON', 'Who is Katy Perry? As she reminded people in the initial run-up to her comeback single “Woman’s World,” where she dusted off her six RIAA-bestowed Diamond awards, she’s one of the biggest-selling pop stars of the millennium, with fizzy, playful tracks like “California Gurls” and strident empowerment anthems like “Firework” racking up millions of sales. She’s judged wannabes on American Idol; she’s headlined the Super Bowl halftime show; she’s celebrated a king’s coronation. She’s done it all, backwards and in heels.    ', 'Who Katy Perry might be in 2024, though, is another question entirely—and one that she tries to answer on her sixth full-length, 143. Leaving Idol behind, which she did in May, implied that she wants to return to being a full-time pop monarch. But the landscape she’s returning to isn’t one easily swayed by cotton-candy bikinis and winking allusions to cherry Chapstick. Thanks to the waning influence of radio, stardom even at the level of Perry’s doesn’t guarantee singles-chart success, while the maximalist productions that she used to lord over feel as dated as a Vine. Perry seems aware of her unmoored state on 143, but that doesn’t stop her from trying to reclaim the cultural spot that she had in in the late ‘00s and early ‘10s through tricks — cheap if hooky affirmations, broad appeals to the male gaze — that worked back then.', '', 'Those tricks include rekindling her relationship with Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, who co-produced “I Kissed A Girl,” the stompily Sapphic hit that began her rise from the Warped Tour to arenas in the late ‘00s, and who was also on the core team that brought cuts like the insistent “Roar,” the electro-trappy “Dark Horse,” and other Perry megahits (including all those Diamond-awarded cuts) to life. Going back to Dr. Luke, who Perry left behind for 2017’s Witness (and in the wake of the producer’s long legal entanglement with Kesha), makes sense in a mercenary way. Perry’s place in pop has been slipping for a while; her Idol tenure coincides with a run where she placed zero singles in the Hot 100’s top ten, and only two in the top 20 (with one being “Feels,” a Calvin Harris-Pharrell-Big Sean collab that beamed Perry’s disembodied voice in from space).', '', 'But in practice on 143, that reteaming more often than not comes off as boring, a rote attempt to rekindle those glory years with slightly updated reference points. “Woman’s World,” the robotic quasi-celebration of being female, sets the table for the cliché-filled, see-Spot-run lyrics that dominate, the playfulness of yore steamrolled over by a database of clichéd rhymes. “Gorgeous,” a duet with fellow Gottwald protégé Kim Petras, comes off like a copied-homework homage to the German singer’s collaboration with Sam Smith “Unholy,” swapping in smoky trap beats for that 2022 cut’s midnight-mass gothiness. “I’m His, He’s Mine” plays the 45 of Crystal Waters’ 1991 house-pop hit “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeness)” at 33, giving Perry and the MC/singer Doechii room to drowsily rhapsodize over a love interest whose biggest asset seems to be sticking around. “Nirvana” is a club cut drained of its stakes, Perry wailing loudly, if not lustily, about a psychosexual union with a partner “in the diamond sky” over a thumping instrumental that feels as fresh as conference-call hold music.    ', '', '143 ends with “Wonder,” a high-gloss banger that recalls the most banal 2010s EDM-fest-pop while telling the next generation to shake off the “weight of the world” and stay “wild” and “pure.” “Can somebody promise me our innocence doesn’t get lost in a cynical world?” Perry asks at one point — a great question to ask in 2024. But coming after the previous 10 tracks’ flop-sweat-flecked effort to crowbar Perry back into the zeitgeist, it sounds utterly hollow — and including her daughter Daisy on the track, which also happens to be the lone offering without any Luke involvement (it was instead produced by the Norwegian pop architects Stargate), feels more like a deflection against critique than a hope that the next generation will find a way to transcend the present’s muckiest parts. To drive home that point, Daisy gets the last word on the album, asking, “someday when we’re wiser/Will our hearts still have that fire?” It’s a pity that Perry doesn’t seem to have asked herself that while putting together this confused attempt to recapture pop listeners’ attention.

Katy Perry's '143' doesn't have a single redeeming song,https://www.businessinsider.com/katy-perrys-143-album-review-2024-9,"['If you\'re a pop-music fan who spends time on the internet, you\'ll probably see a slew of negative reviews for Katy Perry\'s new album, ""143."" You might even start to believe the criticism is overblown or prejudicial, a cliché result of herd mentality.', ""I'm here to assure you that is not the case. The adverse reaction to Perry's seventh major label release is very much earned, if even a little generous."", 'This is the first album I\'ve ever reviewed that doesn\'t have a single cut I would recommend to a friend. At least Perry\'s previous washout, 2020\'s ""Smile,"" boasted the presence of ""Never Really Over,"" which remains a career peak for Perry. Here, on ""143,"" there\'s no standout track, no obvious highlight.', 'Songs like ""Lifetimes,"" ""All The Love,"" and ""Nirvana,"" which are forgettable yet listenable at the very least, only stand out by contrast. If they had been included on a better pop album, they\'d easily fall into skip territory.', 'The best chunk of ""143"" is Doechii\'s verse in ""I\'m His, He\'s Mine,"" which the duo performed during Perry\'s VMA medley. But even the self-described Swamp Princess can\'t inject enough substance or charm to rescue the song from its watered-down Crystal Waters sample and lifeless la-da-dee-la-da-da\'s. It feels like Perry and her producers — in this case, Dr. Luke and Rocco Valdes — took a classic dance tune and surgically removed its soul.', 'Indeed, ""143"" can\'t be appraised in good faith without mention of Dr. Luke and the controversy that surrounded his reunion with Perry.', ""Before this year, the embattled producer hadn't worked with Perry since he was sued by Kesha (a one-time friend of Perry's) in 2014 for sexual, physical, and emotional abuse during her time signed to his label, Kemosabe Records."", ""Dr. Luke denied all of Kesha's claims and countersued for defamation. The two parties reached an undisclosed settlement last year, shortly before Perry confirmed she was working on new music."", 'When Perry launched the ""143"" era in June, fans who supported Kesha during her lengthy legal battle were disappointed that Dr. Luke, an accused abuser, was confirmed as a producer on the lead single ""Woman\'s World,"" an attempted female-empowerment anthem. But that was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to Dr. Luke\'s involvement.', 'Asked to explain why she decided to work with Dr. Luke again, Perry gave a noncommital, imprecise response: ""I understand that it started a lot of conversations, and he was one of many collaborators that I collaborated with,"" she told ""Call Her Daddy"" host Alex Cooper. ""But the reality is, it comes from me.""', 'The actual reality is that Dr. Luke is all over this album, credited as a producer on every song but one: the closing track, ""Wonder.""', ""Most of the album's coproducers, including Valdes, Aaron Joseph, Vaughn Oliver, and Theron Thomas, are Dr. Luke's frequent collaborators, protégés, and Kemosabe signees. Perry didn't simply choose to work with Dr. Luke again; she immersed herself in his creative inner circle."", 'Even if you set aside the allegations against Dr. Luke, ""143"" doesn\'t make a strong case for his input. This is nowhere near the inventive, charismatic pop that made him an in-demand producer in the aughts.', 'Back in the day, Perry\'s alliance with Dr. Luke yielded two hits on her 2008 debut album with Capitol Records (""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hold n Cold""), then five hits on her seminal sophomore album in 2010 (""Teenage Dream,"" ""Last Friday Night,"" ""California Gurls,"" ""The One That Got Away,"" and ""E.T."").', 'Those songs were designed to be fun and radio-friendly, of course, but they were also endearingly weird.', ""At that time, no one could've accused Perry of being boring. She arrived in the pop pantheon as one of one, gleefully equipped with cherry chapstick, candy-colored wigs, whipped cream bras, and alien-sex fantasies. Her producers managed to match her freak with climactic beat drops, swelling choruses, and sticky melodies."", 'However, none of those aforementioned songs were solo endeavors for Dr. Luke. His name was always joined in the credits by Max Martin, Benny Blanco, or both — which now, in retrospect, seems like a crucial piece of information.', 'Without them, Dr. Luke and his new associates have created a pop vacuum, completely devoid of heart and personality.', '""143"" sounds like an AI bot was asked to make a Katy Perry parody album. These songs are mind-numbingly repetitive, aiming for nostalgia and landing somewhere in between stale and imitative.', '""Gimme Gimme,"" the second track featuring 21 Savage, immediately recalls the plinky snoozefest of Justin Bieber\'s ""Changes,"" particularly the Quavo duet ""Intentions.""', 'Perry\'s next track, ""Gorgeous,"" somehow sounds exactly the same, even though it swaps the rap feature for routine harmonies, courtesy of longtime Dr. Luke disciple Kim Petras.', '""Crush"" is a blatant Kylie Minogue knockoff. ""Artificial,"" another collab featuring JID, attempts to clone the cyber-sultriness of ""Dark Horse"" and largely succeeds — except it\'s 2024, not 2013, so it\'s not interesting anymore.', 'For an artist like Perry, who\'s made motherhood and ""feminine divine"" energy a cornerstone of her brand, it\'s difficult to justify crawling back to Dr. Luke under any circumstances — but especially if it was just to make something this unimaginative.', 'Flat synths and anonymous lyrics dominate the ""143"" landscape. Perry was never considered a lyrical mastermind, but her signature humor, once warm, wet, and wild, has melted like a popsicle. We\'re left with syrupy slop like, ""Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight / Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride,"" and ""Yeah, I got those palpitations / Those boom-boom-booms.""', '""I wanna know the truth, even if hurts me,"" Perry repeatedly sings in the penultimate track, ""Truth,"" no fewer than eight times.', ""Well, if that's what she wants, then I'm happy to oblige."", 'Worth listening to: N/A', 'Background music: ""I\'m His, He\'s Mine,"" ""Lifetimes,"" ""All The Love,"" ""Nirvana""', 'Press skip: ""Woman\'s World,"" ""Gimme Gimme (featuring 21 Savage),"" ""Gorgeous (featuring Kim Petras),"" ""Crush,"" ""Artificial (featuring JID),"" ""Truth,"" ""Wonder""', '*Final album score based on songs per category (1 point for ""Worth listening to,"" .5 for ""Background music,"" 0 for ""Press skip"").', 'Jump to']"

Between her woeful lead single “Woman’s World” and her non-explanation as to why she chose to work with controversial producer Dr Luke (Łukasz Gottwald), none of the events of the past months have helped stir any goodwill, or even anticipation, for the pop star’s first album in four years.', 'The timing of this comeback is somewhat awkward. We’re a distracted nation – even major releases from Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande and Beyoncé have been met with less fanfare than you’d expect. Fans are busy genuflecting at the altar of three new goddesses: over the past 12 months, Charli XCX, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter have set a new (higher) standard for the genre. Perry, meanwhile, is still trying to recover from a series of dud albums and a palpable lack of any real hits since 2013’s trap-infused “Dark Horse”.', 'Perhaps that is why she felt compelled to return to the man behind some of her most successful releases, who last year settled nearly a decade of lawsuits and countersuits over pop singer Kesha’s allegation that he drugged and raped her (Gottwald has always vehemently denied her accusations). He has songwriting credits on all but one song on 143, and his presence leaves a sour taste on a record ostensibly written from a woman’s perspective – never mind the fact the majority of Perry’s co-writers are men.', 'Everything on 143 – the number of letters in “I love you” on a pager – feels painfully dated, steeped in a misunderstanding about the Nineties nostalgia that permeates much of 2020s culture. Most of the songs are driven by house-influenced beats, dragging the record down into a bass-heavy quagmire.', '“I’m His, He’s Mine” – on which Perry samples Crystal Waters’s 1991 track “Gypsy Woman” – is perhaps the most glaring indication of how detached she has become. I suppose the cost of living crisis doesn’t come up much during her dinners with Jeff Bezos but spinning Waters’ anthem (about a homeless woman the artist used to see regularly outside a Washington hotel) into an insipid, forgettable club bop warning other women off your man is certainly the biggest clunker on an album full of them.', 'Weirdly, Perry returns to the refrain of the 1991 track for “Crush” as she attempts her own version of Kylie Minogue’s “Padam Padam”, singing: “My heart goes la-da-da-di…” over an empty beat. Her collaborators, too, seem unable to muster much enthusiasm. We’re dealt a shockingly bad few bars from 21 Savage on “Gimme Gimme”, a trap-lite ditty about a late-night hookup. Fellow Dr Luke collaborator Kim Petras emulates Charli XCX on the vocodered “Gorgeous”.', 'There are a few glimmers of the magnetism that made Perry a star. Her stirring, Eighties-tinged ballad “All the Love” is a highlight that seemingly references her marriage to actor Orlando Bloom, and possibly also touches on her divorce from British comedian-turned-conspiracy theorist Russell Brand. It’s one of Perry’s best vocal performances since 2020’s “Never Really Over” – one of her few successes of the last five years.', 'Perry was always at her best when she was being playful. In her heyday, that attitude transpired on tongue-in-cheek bops like “California Gurls” and “I Kissed a Girl”. On 143, that’s been replaced by a weariness (or perhaps wariness) of the industry she once dominated. Most songs here have an underlying hesitance, too preoccupied by their commercial aspirations to have any real fun.', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

As Taylor Swift roars out of sight with her brand of stadium-sized confessionals, Lipa is now arguably Perry’s biggest rival in the synth-pop-queen stakes, and the British star’s Grammy-winning tales of impassive empowerment and escapist sensuality can’t have gone unnoticed.', 'At the heart of Perry’s decidedly patchy new record, 143 — it’s shorthand for “I love you”, relating to the length of each word — are a string of Lupa-like semi-bangers that make up in sleek melodiousness what they lack in philosophical gravitas.', 'The pneumatic Crush takes its cue from Nineties house, as do the ecstatic piano runs of Lifetimes and the thrilling synth arpeggios of All the Love, while Perry’s voice on Nirvana is toned and honed like a gym bunny on Venice Beach.', 'Although still nowhere near her godlike previous hits such as Teenage Dream, these songs are much better than we could have hoped after Perry, 39, released the lead single of the album, Woman’s World, in July.', 'She deservedly copped flak for the feminism-for-dummies tone of that song featuring the lines: “Sexy, confident/ So intelligent/ She is heaven-sent/ So soft, so strong/ She’s a winner, champion/ Superhuman, number one.” We can all get behind the message — well, all of us except Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson — but that really is thuddingly basic.', 'Sadly, horrors like that narrowly outnumber the high points on 143. “I heard you gotta jump just to put on your jeans” rhymes the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage on Gimme Gimme, which I hope is a comment on the tightness of Perry’s trousers rather than the size of her thighs, which wouldn’t be very feminist at all. “If you want my body gotta blow my mind,” replies an oblivious Perry. Whatever.', '• The best albums of 2024 so far', 'I’m His, He’s Mine, meanwhile, unwisely interpolates the la-da-di refrain from Crystal Waters’s bizarrely popular Gypsy Woman, and Gorgeous, a duet with the transgender pop star Kim Petras, is hamstrung by some truly vacuous posturing. “You want the digits to my cellular,” breathes Perry, which is a hard scenario to swallow when we know she is shacked up with her Hollywood fiancé Orlando Bloom and their young daughter.', 'Perhaps more concerning are Artificial and the closing Wonder, which sail dangerously close to Eurovision territory.

The singer’s early output has undergone a favorable critical reevaluation of late, and her Video Vanguard performance at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards was a reminder that, just a decade ago, she was capable of churning out a seemingly endless stream of radio hits. Perry’s style of maximalist pop, no longer in vogue by the late 2010s, has been experiencing a revival, as evidenced by the breakout success of artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan.', 'But such hopes were quickly dashed when Perry dropped “Woman’s World,” a platitude-filled exercise in feminist sloganeering that found her reuniting with longtime collaborator Dr. Luke (she temporarily ceased working with the producer until after his legal dispute with fellow pop singer Kesha was resolved). It didn’t help that TikTokers noticed similarities between Perry’s declarations of “sexy, confident, so intelligent” and a joke song that people sing to their dogs.', 'Mercifully, Perry’s attempt at delivering a socially conscious message on 143 ends with “Woman’s World.” But the remainder of the album boasts lyrics that range from the insipid (“I wanna know the truth/Even if it hurts me,” she confesses on “Truth”) to the nonsensical (“I’m on a new vibration/Yeah I, I need some medication,” she declares on “Crush”).', 'Throughout 143, whose default setting is lifeless EDM beats, Perry recruits an eclectic array of guest talent, but most of them turn in half-hearted verses. On “Gimme Gimme,” Atlanta rapper 21 Savage sounds bored as he delivers jokey lines like “I’m like Amazon ‘cause I got what you need,” while “Gorgeous” finds Kim Petras reaching a lyrical nadir with “Da Vinci, Da Vinci my body.” Of the guest performers, only Doechii delivers with a genuinely charismatic and dynamic performance, but neither she nor a sample of Crystal Waters’s 1991 club hit “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless)” can save the plodding “I’m His, He’s Mine.”', 'There are a few bright spots on 143, though none of them reach Perry’s peak output. “Lifetimes,” like many the songs here, is built around a generic house beat, but a relatively strong melodic hook is a reminder that Perry and her collaborators are still capable of writing some earworms. And the song’s trite theme of eternal love, which also informs the album’s closing track, “Wonder,” feels sweetly sincere when you realize it’s directed toward Perry’s daughter Daisy.', 'But despite those moments, and the album’s generally upbeat vibe, 143 feels surprisingly joyless.

Katy Perry: 143 review – wan Europop revival falls short of total catastrophe,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/20/katy-perry-143-review-wan-europop-revival-falls-short-of-total-catastrophe,"['(Capitol)\nFollowing disastrous comeback singles and videos prompting environmental investigation, Perry’s seventh album isn’t the calamity expected – but it isn’t good, either', 'T\nhe video for Katy Perry’s recent single Woman’s World concluded with the artist being hoisted aloft, clinging to a helicopter’s door frame with one hand, brandishing a ring light in the shape of the medical pictogram for “female” and bellowing “I’M KATY PERRY!” It was clearly intended as the grand denouement of a big comeback, four years after her last album, Smile: a long time in an era when pop artists seem to constantly provide new material to streaming services. All the stops had been pulled out to ensure a massive hit – a chorus evidently designed to be sung en masse at karaoke by makeshift distaff choirs (and perhaps, as one reviewer suggested, to be lip-synced to on RuPaul’s Drag Race) and a video that attempted to both tick some culturally relevant topics and provoke a TikTok dance craze, its steps briefly shown towards the end.', 'But things really didn’t work out as intended: Woman’s World was very coolly received indeed. There was a great deal of chatter online about the advisability of releasing a song, ostensibly about female empowerment, co-written and produced by Dr Luke – a man previously accused of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by his ex-collaborator Kesha, although he countersued her for defamation and they settled out of court – accompanied by a video, also ostensibly about female empowerment, that spent a remarkable amount of time offering up lingering shots of ladies’ buttocks and cleavages, the artist’s included. Perry defended the latter as satire rather than a cartoonish attempt to have one’s cake and eat it, but that seemed to butter few parsnips. Having clearly landed wrong, Woman’s World limped into the lower reaches of the charts, then keeled over entirely.', 'Its follow-up, Lifetimes, arrived with a video that provoked an investigation from the government of the Balearic Islands’ environment department into whether its making caused damage to the heavily protected sand dunes of S’Espalmador – and failed to make the US charts at all.', 'Commercially disastrous singles, online furore, being branded pop’s leading menace to the sand dunes of S’Espalmador, all in the space of a month. Were you Katy Perry, you might well consider just packing your comeback in, cancelling your forthcoming album and going home to quietly enjoy the fruits of the 100m-plus records you’ve already sold. After all, while it’s not guaranteed that a pop album preceded by two flop singles is a turkey, it’s 99% certain. But, it seems that, if it comes down to gamely selling people a turkey, Perry is up for it like Bernard Matthews: 143 has arrived on schedule.', 'The promotional campaign around it has gone so wildly off-piste that it feels faintly surprising to report that 143 isn’t that bad. It isn’t that good either, but it’s certainly some way short of total catastrophe. There are moments where it appears to be aiming for the sort of retro dancefloor focus that powered Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, not least when Lifetimes bursts open with a piano riff that vaguely recalls FPI Project’s Italo house classic Rich in Paradise, although it’s worth pointing out that the references are rather less artfully done here: I’m His, He’s Mine has the hook from Crystal Waters’ Gypsy Woman plonked into it, and what Crush really seems to want to evoke is the oompah Euro-house of O-Zone’s Dragostea Din Tei, a sound it’s hard to imagine anyone was clamouring wildly for a revival of. There’s a lot of passable songs based around a pop take on the filtering effects and compressed kick drums of French touch. Closing track Wonder is the best thing here, melodically – it’s got a really strong chorus – and it probably deserves a better setting than the dated EDM anthemics dished up by producers Stargate and Cirkut.', 'Elsewhere, 21 Savage and Kim Petras’s guest spots are welded to pretty wan bits of trap-influenced pop, but if releasing album tracks that dabble in wan trap-influenced pop was a crime, the list of future court hearings would look like the bill of Radio 1’s Big Weekend or the Capital Jingle Bell Ball. And stripped of its video, Woman’s World is perfectly serviceable as a bit of glossily depthless synth pop: had the decision not been taken during its making to press the button marked “add half-hearted lunge for social relevance” – or had Perry released it a few years back, when, frankly, you couldn’t move for pop singles making half-hearted lunges for social relevance with complete impunity – it might even have been a hit.', 'And that’s 143’s big problem. It feels slightly out of time, a common-or-garden mediocre pop album with the misfortune to be scheduled in the wake of Charli xcx’s Brat, Chappell Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess and Sabrina Carpenter’s Short N’ Sweet, a trio of messily inventive and hugely successful albums that collectively suggest a certain raising of the pop bar has taken place. What would once have sufficed, at least commercially, now won’t: that its author and her team didn’t notice seems far more intrinsic to 143’s downfall than questionable choices of collaborator, misfiring videos or indeed damage to the sand dunes of S’Espalmador.']"
Katy Perry succumbs to mindless club fillers on 143,https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/albums/katy-perry-143-succumbs-to-mindless-club-fillers,"['Let’s be real: nobody foresaw the level of historic disaster this album would bring to the table before the rollout began.', ""Just last year, when Katy Perry announced that she had been working on new music, the internet's desire to see her great again was palpable. They were more than ready to celebrate her abdicating the years-long throne of pop music’s Flop Empire. 2020’s Smile, while housing some ear candies, was a middle-of-the-road return that, for the first time in her career, did not make it to the No. 1 spot on both US and UK charts. Wasn’t the lightning-struck arrival of “Never Really Over” meant to prelude something? All expectations were then re-routed to her seventh effort, which, to many’s dismay, turns out to be one of this decade’s most astounding car crashes in the industry."", 'The backfire of “Woman’s World” on Perry has been well discussed. Aside from its yuck-inducing faux-feminism and hotbed of male dominance in the credits, the monstrosity solidifies the fact that she is more a performer than an artist. Her performative vigour has taken the lead in fuelling her star power all along, and the exhilarating VMAs that aired last week attests to it. Thematic visions of honouring motherhood that she so often talks about in interviews feel disjointed when conceited coquetry and fleeting club romances rule over half of 143. Are provocative tracks like “Gimme Gimme” and “Crush” truly the creative outcome of maternal love? The dots are not connecting.', 'Dr. Luke’s frigid production and Stargate’s stone-faced songwriting attempt at everything except an exaltation of Perry’s star power. If these were the people behind Teenage Dream, 143 shows that age comes with qualitative degradation. “Crush” has all it needs to be in the playlist of Eurodance duplicates: mumbling post-choruses, stagnant kick-snare beats, verses of shallow observations. “Artificial” reads like a cheap fabrication of “E.T.”; her parts are so drab that JID can’t help but carry. She’s capable of so much more than creating these zombiesque club fillers. Everyone knows it. But it’s crystal clear that she values accessibility over artistic evolution.', 'Nothing sparks on 143. It’s all about easy endings and uncomplicated emotions, thus targeted for basically anyone, but what she doesn’t know is that the majority aren’t as tasteless now. The comeback singles are met with brutal reception in every direction. “Wonder” is the only one with replay value, which features her child’s voice and perhaps hints at their undetermined gender identity, leaving it up for them to decide whenever ready (“Beautiful girl”, “Beautiful boy”). The truth is – and she must know even if it hurts her – everything else signals a career nosedive from which her reputation might not survive. On the bright side, though, 143 adds more shade to a colourful year of pop music.', 'Get the Best Fit take on the week in music direct to your inbox every Friday']"

The singer released her new album, 143, on Friday, and I’m here to report that it’s not very good. The charming, witty woman who gave us One of the Boys and Teenage Dream is long gone, and while she was briefly replaced by someone who made serviceable earworms (“Harleys in Hawaii,” “Never Really Over”), the new Perry is someone whose lead single can’t even crack the Top 40. The tracks on Perry’s latest are stuffed with cliché platitudes about love set to uninspired Dr. Luke beats. It’ll make you wonder, “She went back to him for this?”', 'But, hey, I’m not a professional music critic; maybe they see something in 143 that I don’t. Let’s check in with what they have to say.', 'Variety writes, “Across many of its 11 songs, Perry sounds disaffected and removed, as if she’d just punched in between American Idol tapings.” Yikes. NME calls it “a serviceable but slightly dull collection on which Perry struggles to relocate her old sense of fun.” The Independent \ndragged Perry for the album’s title — “Everything on 143 — the number of letters in ‘I love you’ on a pager — feels painfully dated, steeped in a misunderstanding about the Nineties nostalgia that permeates much of 2020s culture” — and the Associated Press piled on. “She may love us, but the album is more like 144 — ‘I made mush.’”', 'Okay, so the critics are not loving it. Who cares? Perry recently shared a photo of herself wearing a shirt that read, “They don’t build statues of critics.” (Charli XCX was the first person to make waves for wearing the same shirt back in 2022.) She doesn’t give a damn what they say! What are her loyal stans thinking?', 'One KatyCat on X gave the album an 8.5, writing, “She came to have fun and brought with her dance music as good as a gospel singer turned pop star can deliver.” I can’t really tell if that’s a compliment.

Katy Perry – ‘143’ review: a pop star struggles to relocate her old sense of fun,https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/katy-perry-143-review-3795535,"['The ‘Teenage Dream’ singer reconnects with her old collaborators for her seventh album, but fails to recreate the magic', 'It’s a shame that Katy Perry’s new album opens with ‘Woman’s World’, arguably the most disastrous comeback single in recent memory. This mechanical-sounding female empowerment anthem was partly sunk by poor optics: Perry was widely criticised for crafting it with Dr Luke, the producer who was accused (though never convicted) of emotional abuse and sexual assault by Kesha. But at the same time, ‘Woman’s World’ was also torpedoed by its hopelessly vague, dated lyrics. When Perry sings “she’s a flower, she’s a thorn, superhuman, number one”, it’s hard not to wonder whether ChatGPT should have been credited alongside her five co-writers.', 'It would be easier to forget about ‘Woman’s World’ if it were buried at the end, but at least ‘143’ improves when it’s over. When this album was announced in July, it was billed as a “sexy, fearless, return to form… jam packed with the empowering, sexy and provocative pop anthems you’ve come to love”. In recent years, Perry has been more prominent as an American Idol judge, but clearly she wants to be a massive pop star again. This, presumably, is why she has decided to reconnect with her main ‘Teenage Dream’ era collaborators: Dr Luke is credited on each of this album’s first ten tracks, while Norwegian hitmakers Stargate oversee the cheesy final song ‘Wonder’.', 'In its middle section, ‘143’ nearly lives up to the sales pitch. Second single ‘Lifetimes’ is a pretty on-the-nose house-pop stomper, but the chorus does burrow into your brain – Perry didn’t become one of the world’s biggest pop stars without knowing her way around a good hook. ‘Crush’, which borrows from French Affair’s 2000 Eurodance hit ‘My Heart Goes Boom (La Di Da Da)’, is another satisfying club banger. And Perry serves up some serious ear candy on ‘Gorgeous’, a slinky girls’ night out duet with fellow Dr Luke collaborator Kim Petras, who supplies the chaotic energy that this song really needs: “Fuck up the club, ain’t payin’ for the damage.”', 'Elsewhere, though, Perry seems to be grasping for ideas. ‘Artificial’ is really just a rewrite of her grinding ‘Teenage Dream’ hit ‘E.T.’, though this time she’s singing about a bionic man rather than an alien. “Are you gonna love me like a human? Can you touch me in a simulation?” she asks, sounding as though she’s about to road-test a new VR headset.', '‘I’m His, He’s Mine’ pairs Perry with rising star Doechii, a shrewd move, but the track itself sucks the life out of a chunky sample from Crystal Waters’ 1991 club classic ‘Gypsy Woman’. It doesn’t help that Perry’s lyrics express some pretty unsisterly sentiments given that she was telling us “it’s a woman world” three songs earlier. “Why you overworkin’ on him like a suntan? Go and get your own man,” Perry sings.', 'The result is a record that sometimes hits the target but rarely leaves a lasting impression. Pop fans have a fondness for resurrecting “flop” albums that were given short shrift when they first came out: Mariah Carey’s ill-fated soundtrack album ‘Glitter’ and Christina Aguilera’s sonic hodgepodge ‘Bionic’ have both become cult classics of sorts. But even this fate seems unlikely for ‘143’, a serviceable but slightly dull collection on which Perry struggles to relocate her old sense of fun.', '', 'The world’s defining voice in music and pop culture: breaking what’s new and what’s next since 1952.', 'When you purchase through affiliate links on NME.com, you may contribute to our site through commissions.

An author from the Austrian radio station FM4 wrote about the ""most desperate comeback of the year."" Since then, Perry has released two more singles which, although not generating a comparable shitstorm, also did not fully convince critics.', 'On Friday (September 20), the US singer will release the accompanying album, titled ""143"" - but can it save her career?', 'Musically, Perry, as usual, is oriented towards glossy electro-pop. While ""Woman\'s World"" is lifted by a simple pulsating beat and retro synthesizer, ""Lifetimes"" sounds more like the soundtrack of a dull holiday home.', 'The most interesting is the third single, ""I\'m His, He\'s Mine,"" which Perry recorded with the US rapper Doechii. The song works mainly due to the rap parts - and because they rely on a sample of the immensely catchy 90s house hit ""Gypsy Woman (She\'s Homeless)"" by Crystal Waters.', 'Backwards-looking gender images', 'For her new album, Katy Perry once again collaborated with Dr Luke, who was also responsible for hit singles like Perry\'s ""Teenage Dream."" He is the music producer who was embroiled in a years-long legal battle with the musician Kesha (""Tik Tok""). She accused him of manipulating and sexually abusing her over years. Dr Luke denied this, and the two sued each other, settling out of court in 2023.', 'Perry acknowledged that the incident provoked a lot of talk. Speaking on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" the US artist said she wrote these songs from her experience, as her whole life has been one of change and Dr Luke was one of the people who made that possible for her.', 'The past years have been characterized by female pop stars empowering themselves. Musicians like Kesha, but also Taylor Swift, Adele, Billie Eilish, Charli XCX or Chappell Roan actively advocate for their rights - and refuse to go along with the role of the sexy pop star.', 'Perry\'s excuses and a music video in which exclusively normatively beautiful, almost naked women dance to her statement that women ""can be anything"" seems strangely backward-looking.', 'Katy Perry reacts to criticism', 'In the video for ""Woman\'s World"", the musician is seen in pin-up outfits, holding a diamond-studded screwdriver aloft, driving a monster truck and pouring a bottle of whiskey into her mouth.', 'That was satire, Perry countered after criticism arose, saying in an Instagram post that she was just trying to have fun and ""be a bit sarcastic with it.""', '""It\'s very slapstick and very on the nose.

Katy Perry’s rocky album rollout shows how not to manage your pop career,https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2024/09/17/katy-perrys-rocky-album-rollout-shows-how-not-to-manage-your-pop-career/,"['', 'There’s a lot to be said for knowing when to throw in the towel or walk away from a good thing before it sours. Look at Adele: she toured and took up a Las Vegas residency after making her comeback with her album 30, in 2021, but now it’s time to disappear back into the shadows. She told fans in Munich last month that she would “not see you for an incredibly long time ... I have spent the last seven years building a new life for myself, and I want to live it now.”', 'Katy Perry might be wise to start taking notes. Adele’s fellow star has become something of a cautionary tale of how not to manage your pop career. Although the Californian is responsible for several bona-fide bangers, from Hot N Cold and Teenage Dream to Firework, the thread arguably began to unravel with the release of Smile. That 2020 album was a critical flop, but it was no skin off her nose: after building a career that has encompassed everything from a long stint as a judge on American Idol to her own Vegas residency, plus a multitude of advertising deals, there were plenty of nixers to keep the lights on in the Perry household.', 'Now the 39-year-old is preparing to re-enter the fray – but the lead-up to this week’s release of 143, her seventh album, has been a disaster. First there was the tone-deafness of working with the producer Lukasz Gottwald, aka Dr Luke, who was embroiled in a long-running legal dispute with the musician Kesha after she accused him of rape and abuse. Although Gottwald denied all allegations, and a civil case was settled in 2023, the irony – some would say distastefulness – of his cowriting the album’s supposedly feminist-leaning lead single, Woman’s World, was not lost on fans. Then the video for its second single, Lifetimes, shot on the Balearic island of Espalmador, was criticised for reportedly infringing on an environmentally protected area. Both singles have performed disastrously. It’s safe to say bad juju now surrounds the pop princess.', '', 'The controversy and titillation that Perry has embraced since early in her career have usually paid off: her debut single, I Kissed a Girl, was initially slammed by the LGBTQ+ community but was later embraced as a celebration of bisexuality. You could argue that the warning signs were there early, too, with the likes of Ur So Gay, a song that makes a juvenile playground taunt the basis of its lyrical hook (“You’re so gay, and you don’t even like boys”). Perry has always trodden a thin line between frivolous and puerile – and her lyrics have never been in the running to win awards.', 'But Perry has shown a masterly ability to spin blunders into positives. One of your dancers makes a monumental cock-up during your Super Bowl half-time performance? Make “Left Shark” a thing! A long-running feud with the biggest pop star on the planet? Make a big deal of rekindling your friendship with Taylor Swift and appearing in one of her videos! An ex-husband who has become a conspiracy theorist accused of rape, assault and emotional abuse? Replace Russell Brand with another famous English man – the thankfully wholesome Orlando Bloom – and brush over that ill-fated marriage!', '', 'It remains to be seen if she will recover from her association with Gottwald. “I understand that it started a lot of conversations,” she said this month, trying to sidestep the issue. “He was one of many collaborators that I collaborated with. But the reality is, it comes from me. The truth is, I wrote these songs from my experience of my whole life going through this metamorphosis, and he was one of the people to help facilitate all that – one of the writers, one of the producers. I am speaking from my own experience. When I speak about Woman’s World, I speak about feeling so empowered now: as a mother, as a woman, giving birth, creating life, creating another set of organs.” Right, so.', 'The Woman’s World video also caused a rumpus. Fans didn’t buy her slightly belligerent line that her adopting the famous Rosie the Riveter persona while dressed in a variety of titillating outfits was satire. “Having to explain a joke means it didn’t land,” remarked one. “This feels like a parody of feminism gone wrong,” wrote another. “This feels like it’s mocking women instead of empowering them.”', '', 'Despite all her missteps, Perry has proven a canny businesswoman. She’s now said to be worth $500 million, having sold a portion of her music rights for a reported $225 million last year. So buckets of money. Perhaps the problem is that what Perry may not have in spades is the likability factor. From the damp squib of Smile to those recent cringeworthy ads for Just Eat, much of what she has done over the past few years seems only to have tarnished her once pristine pop crown. And it’s difficult to imagine her now making an album that has as much impact as Charli XCX’s Brat, or anything by Dua Lipa or Billie Eilish, or reinventing herself the way Swift (whose reaction to Perry’s MTV VMAs speech last week went viral) did with Evermore, her folk sidestep.', 'Former admirers have been less than diplomatic here, too. “Katy, just retire, your comeback was an embarrassing flop,” one brutally commented under a recent Instagram post. A permanent retreat into the sunset may not be necessary, but it could serve Perry well to take that leaf out of Adele’s book and step back to enjoy the fruits of her labour for a few years with Bloom and her young daughter.', 'The album’s title is supposed to be Perry’s secret code for “I love you”, but for now it’s more a case of: “Maybe we should start seeing other people. We’re on two different paths right now. We’ve both changed and grown apart. I think we need some space.” You get the message, Katy: it’s not us, it’s you.', '© 2024 The Irish Times DAC', 'Use precise geolocation data. Actively scan device characteristics for identification.

Katy Perry’s ‘143’ flounders rather than flourishes,https://www.melodicmag.com/2024/09/20/katy-perrys-143-flounders-rather-than-flourishes/,"['Date:', 'Recommended Tracks: “I’M HIS, HE’S MINE,” “GORGEOUS,” “TRUTH”\nArtists You Might Like: Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus', 'In the 1976 issue of CREEM magazine, the late, great rock critic Lester Bangs argued that “it’s tough having heroes. It’s the hardest thing in the world. It’s harder than being a hero.” In his review of David Bowie’s Station to Station LP, Bangs explained that “hero-worshippers (fans) must live with the continually confirmed dread of hero-slippage.” This year has seen, to some extent, the unfortunate hero-slippage of Katy Perry, an artist who ruled the 2010’s with her insatiably uplifting pop and over-the-top theatrics.  ', 'Across all of its 34-minute pulse, Perry’s sixth studio album 143, out today, accomplishes its intended purpose of being a straightforward, bass-heavy mood-setter to rev the listener up before hitting the clubs. Where it struggles is its inability to push beyond this at-times dated dance floor fantasy, ultimately leading to sounds, refrains and themes that warrant head scratches over standing ovations. ', 'Earlier this summer, posts online indicated a widespread longing for Perry to return with the same kind of knack for hitmaking she had in her imperial era of the late aughts and 2010’s. The odds seemed ever in her favor for a welcomed comeback after her time serving as a judge on American Idol and raising a daughter with financé Orlando Bloom. By universal alignment, she seemed primed — and almost destined — for a comeback of cataclysmic proportions. That is, until the pendulum took a brutal swing the other way after the release of 143’s lead single “WOMAN’S WORLD.” Reception to the long awaited comeback single was brutal, to say the least (largely due to Perry’s unsavory creative reunion with Dr. Luke, the pop auteur accused of sexual assault by Kesha). Since then, the jumpy, piano-led “LIFETIMES” and the Crystal Waters-sampling “I’M HIS, HE’S MINE” featuring Floridian rapper Doechii have slowly turned the red-hot reactions to this new era of Perry’s career more lukewarm. ', 'It is in this generally lukewarm state that 143 arrives, opening with the forever-tarnished “WOMAN’S WORLD” before jumping into thudding, lighthearted cuts. “GIMME GIMME,” featuring a less-than-impressive verse from 21 Savage, idles in a monotonous midtempo pulse that sports flashes of the flirtatious Perry on 2012’s “Dressin’ Up,” but stays far too close to the ground for things to really take off. For the most part, the album sticks to its guns, offering songs that can be deliciously seductive and don’t aim for much else than sexy, electronic dance pop. The album’s Kim Petras collaboration “GORGEOUS” is a somewhat-unlikely pairing of pop prima donnas that pays off in a syrupy blend of the two artist’s voices. “ALL THE LOVE” finds its groove through simple lyricism and equally uncomplicated synth heartbeat. ', '', '', 'The album’s aesthetic and studio-made sound flirt with the concept of musical futurism, but the songs struggle to find their wings to propel the record into that territory. Many of the tracks rely heavily on their dance pop production as a ploy for catchiness, when in reality, the electronic synth-pop production often feels like a hindrance to Perry’s knack for arena-fit chrouses. “NIRVANA” forgoes the opportunity to thrust the song into high gear with a killer chorus and instead meanders in a quasi-Euro-pop instrumental that can’t help but sound dated. “CRUSH” and “I’M HIS, HE’S MINE” rely on overly-repetitive “la da dee’s” for earworm attractiveness, though the latter is one of the album’s finer moments. ', 'On 2010’s monumental Teenage Dream, moments of free-spirited friskiness shone especially technicolor in contrast to the thematic gravitas of others. Here, Perry seemed to have the perfect formula for crafting not only undeniable hit singles, but albums that ebbed and flowed both thematically and sonically while still tying things together with her signature quirk. This new record’s aim for seriousness and existentialism feels out of place alongside what has been described by Perry herself as an LP intended to lift spirits and offer dance floor serenity. “ARTIFICIAL,” featuring Atlanta-born rapper JID, sounds like a shallow outtake from the “purposeful pop” of 2017’s Witness with added BPM, while album closer “WONDER,” featuring a cameo from Perry’s daughter Daisy, shoots for the lyrical catharsis of “Firework” but sounds more fit for a campfire circle rather than a dance floor. ', 'When you tie Michael Jackson for the most number one singles from one album and the efforts that follow aren’t as seismic, you risk becoming engulfed in that aforementioned hero-slippage. Perry’s career heights are as tall as Mount Everest, and it’s no easy task to climb back up to the summit repeatedly, let alone once. She will forever remain one of the godmothers of 2010’s pop, and perhaps it’s that framing itself that hinders her ability to push forward with the mainstream by her side. Sure, she’ll still maintain her strong base of diehard KatyCat’s (your critic included), but it seems unlikely that a mainstream comeback the size of Madonna’s Ray of Light, for example, is on the horizon. 143 isn’t a musical abomination as some may have you believe, but Perry’s attempts at supercharged dance unity ultimately flounder rather than flourish.', '', 'Keep up with Katy Perry: Instagram // Spotify // X // Facebook // Website', '', '', '', 'SHARE POST:', 'More from Author', 'Email: melodicmag@gmail.com', '2014-2023 - All Rights Reserved']"
Katy Perry – 143,https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/katy-perry-143/,"['The internet can be a curious place. One day, you’re the cream of the crop; the next, you’re a withering hashtag. Katy Perry’s online downfall has been coming for a while, the vitriolic reviews of her 2020 album ‘Smile’ indicating that her pop lustre had become to fall away. Lead single ‘Woman’s World’ however seemed to trigger something. Deciding to work with Dr Luke – a notorious figure in pop – became the final straw for many observers, and since then… well, nothing has gone right.', 'Out now, ‘143’ isn’t all that bad a pop album. In places, her melodic flourish and penchant for Millennial camp come to the fore in a manner that suggests the creative fires are still burning. There’s a curious sense of being out of time, however – whether that’s the slim runtime (a CD friendly 11 tracks) or the production motifs, this feels curiously dated next to her blossoming peers.', 'There are some definite highlights on here. ‘Gorgeous’ pairs Katy Perry against Kim Petras – who has herself worked with Dr Luke – and the pair have all sorts of fun amid the plasticky production. ‘Nirvana’ is a surreal piece of Euro-pop flavouring, and the lurid 80s tones of ‘Crush’ rattle around your brain.', '—', '—', 'JID is perhaps one of the better collaborations, on the frothy ‘Artificial’, while closer ‘Wonder’ overflows with child-like glee.', 'Even amongst its slim tracklisting, however, there are still mis-steps. ‘Woman’s World’ is a jarring opener, ‘I’m His, He’s Mine’ – with its frothy ‘Gypsy Woman’ interpolation – feels slight, and throughout the lyrics won’t be winning Pulitzers any time soon.', 'But then, Katy Perry was never really about that. A brash dose of colour for a drab post-Millennial pop scene, she was the bulldozer through the critics doors. On ‘143’ however, there’s a feeling that the world has moved on – with Chappell Roan’s tour sparking Beatlemania-esque scenes of adoration and Sabrina Carpenter maintaining a stranglehold on the charts, you struggle to see where this playful yet unsatisfying record fits into pop’s firmament.', '5/10', 'Words: Robin Murray', '']"
Why Katy Perry's comeback has gone so wrong,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240919-why-katy-perrys-comeback-has-gone-so-wrong,"[""She was one of the world's biggest pop stars – but her new album has been plagued by controversy and failed singles. Here's why she's stumbled – and what it says about music today."", ""The comeback has a special place in pop culture. From Judy Garland's career-reviving 1961 concert at Carnegie Hall to Cher's reinvention as a chart-topping dance diva with 1998's Believe, it's a story that never loses its emotional piquancy. There's something moving and even comforting about seeing a great star return to the top, particularly because it doesn't happen every time. For this reason, the narrative's sad flipside – the failed comeback – is every bit as fascinating. It reminds us that to miss the target is fundamentally human and that nothing in life is guaranteed."", 'This is the prevailing wind that Katy Perry faces today as she releases her seventh album, 143. Its controversial lead single Woman\'s World stalled at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 65 in the UK when it arrived in July, while its more anodyne follow-up, Lifetimes, had to settle for a number 15 placing on the less prestigious Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. These are crushing results for an artist who has more diamond singles denoting US sales of 10 million units – six – than any female artist bar Rihanna. ""Katy Perry is one of the biggest names in pop music, so when these songs didn\'t cut through, it created an interesting story for the media,"" says Hugh McIntyre, a music journalist with Forbes. And that story is: Why is her new music not connecting with the public?', 'The problems all began with the Woman\'s World rollout in July. Two months after its release, it\'s difficult to regard the song as anything other than dead on arrival. In an Apple Music 1 interview, Perry said she wanted it to reflect her ""feminine divine"" and feel ""empowering"" in a similar way to her signature hits Firework (2010) and Roar (2013). When she sings ""it\'s a woman\'s world and you\'re lucky to be living in it,"" it\'s a characteristically plainspoken expression of that message. Perry shrewdly acknowledged in the interview that people associate her with ""songs that are captions on T-shirts and stuff like that"". ', 'However, many fans and critics felt that Perry\'s feminist message was fatally undermined by her choice of collaborator – producer Lukasz Gottwald, better known as Dr Luke. Perry worked extensively with Dr Luke on her three most successful albums – 2008\'s One of the Boys, 2010\'s Teenage Dream and 2013\'s Prism – but he was absent from her subsequent albums, 2017\'s Witness and 2020\'s Smile. Both of these were written and released within the timeframe of his lengthy legal battle with pop singer Kesha. Though Perry has never commented in a press interview on her decision to sever ties with Dr Luke, she said during a 2017 deposition that she chose not to work with him on Witness because she didn\'t want to appear to be ""taking a side"".', 'At the time, their legal battle was still sending shockwaves through the music industry. In October 2014, Kesha had filed a lawsuit against Dr Luke claiming he had drugged and raped her on two occasions in addition to ""sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally"" abusing her. Dr Luke countersued Kesha for defamation and said she had fabricated claims to extricate herself from a recording contract. In February 2020, a judge ruled that Kesha had defamed Dr Luke when she claimed in a text to Lady Gaga that the producer had raped Perry; the producer denied this allegation and Perry said it was ""absolutely not"" true during her deposition. Kesha and Dr Luke\'s extended dispute was eventually settled in June 2023 when both parties posted a statement saying they had ""agreed to a resolution"".', 'However, Dr Luke\'s name remains controversial, even as some industry gatekeepers have welcomed him back into the fold – since 2021, he has picked up multiple Grammy nominations for his work with pop-rap star Doja Cat. Music journalist Rhian Daly believes that Perry ""really misjudged how working with Dr Luke again would go down"". Though Daly acknowledges that Perry is ""not the first artist to collaborate with Dr Luke since Kesha\'s legal battle"", she also notes that Doja Cat in particular has since distanced herself from him. In 2021, the rapper and singer told Rolling Stone that there is music of hers ""that he\'s credited for, where I\'m like, \'Hmm, I don\'t know, I don\'t know if you did anything on that\'"". She also said: ""I don\'t think I need to work with him again."" By contrast, a representative from Perry\'s label told Rolling Stone in June that ""Katy knew exactly the album she wanted to make and put together the team to make it happen"".', 'As a result, Perry launched her 143 album campaign under a fog of controversy; many fans found it confusing at best that she would craft a song about female empowerment with a man who has been publicly accused of abuse by a woman – albeit that the complaint was dropped and never went to a court. The song\'s lyrics were also called into question. In her songwriting, Perry has always favoured mass appeal over sophistication  – her 2010 hit Firework features the couplet: ""Boom, boom, boom / Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon."" But even so, the lyrics of Woman\'s World feel reductive, particularly given the huge issues of womanhood and gender equality she is writing about. ""She\'s a winner, champion, superhuman, number one,"" Perry sings on the pre-chorus. ', 'Though well-meaning, this rather monolithic vision of feminine excellence might have resonated better a decade ago when the expression ""girlboss"" still felt fresh. Music journalist Amy Davidson says that in the current climate, fans ""won\'t stand for tokenistic attempts at entering the conversation"". She points out that two of 2024\'s most talked-about artists, Charli XCX and Chappell Roan, have ""blazed trails"" by writing with scorching authenticity. XCX\'s recent hit Girl So Confusing, for example, explores the messy complexity of female friendships with such matter-of-fact lyrics as: ""Sometimes I think you might hate me / Sometimes I think I might hate you / Maybe you just wanna be me."" Meanwhile, democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has used Roan\'s spiky and direct call-to-arms Femininomenon in a TikTok campaign video – something Perry could feasibly have imagined Woman\'s World being deployed for. ', 'Meanwhile, Perry\'s accompanying music video for the song only added fuel to her detractors\' fire. Scenes in which she channelled World War Two icon Rosie the Riveter and portrayed a bikini-clad bionic woman were perceived by some to be pandering to the male gaze. Perry responded to this criticism by seemingly claiming that the visuals were intended to send up the male gaze. ""You can do anything! Even satire!"" she posted on X alongside a clip from the video.', 'This defensive approach was a far cry from the confidence with which she announced her new album 143 on the same day as Woman\'s World dropped. In a press release, the LP was trumpeted as ""a sexy, fearless return to form for the multifaceted musician"" that is ""jam packed with the empowering, sexy and provocative pop anthems you\'ve come to love"". The subtext was easy to decipher: Perry was aiming to regain the cultural domination of her late 2000s and early 2010s imperial phase. ', ""Home to the sleekly cheeky hits I Kissed a Girl and Hot n Cold, Perry's 2008 album One of the Boys – her second, but first on a major label – made her a global star. Then with 2010's Teenage Dream LP, she went truly supernova. A bold, maximalist mix of pop, rock, hip-hop, dance and disco, it yielded five Billboard Hot 100 number one singles including California Gurls and the title track, matching a record set by Michael Jackson's 1987 album Bad. During this era, Perry displayed her ability to ride the zeitgeist while mining multi-generational nostalgia by filling her Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) music video with celebrity cameos ranging from then-recent viral star Rebecca Black to 1990s boyband Hanson and 1980s heartthrob Corey Feldman."", 'More like this:', '• How Espresso became song of the summer', ""• Why Coldplay are the 21st Century's defining band"", ""• The song that is key to Beyoncé's new album"", 'Released in 2013, Perry\'s more mature fourth album Prism was less of a blockbuster success, but it did yield another two Billboard Hot 100 number ones: Roar and Dark Horse. The bottom only really fell out of her chart-topping era with 2017\'s Witness LP. Perry described it as an album of ""purposeful pop"" written in the wake of the previous year\'s highly polarised presidential election, but this message was undercut by second single Bon Appétit. Filled with crass food-as-sex metaphors, it stalled at number 37 in the UK and number 59 in the US. Though her subsequent album, 2020\'s Smile, was trailed by the genuinely brilliant electro banger Never Really Over, it failed to return Perry to the top of the charts.', 'Still, it is worth noting that Perry remained a power player even when her stock had apparently fallen: in 2018, Forbes named her the highest-paid woman in music after she pocketed $83 million thanks to a successful tour and her new judging role on American Idol. The singer has kept her profile up by appearing on the TV singing contest ever since, but she announced in February that the current season will be her last: a sure sign she wants to remind people that she is a pop star first. Sadly, neither Woman\'s World or its follow-up singles have quite restored her lustre. Lifetimes, a house-flavoured celebration of maternal love, and I\'m His, He\'s Mine, a collaboration with rising star Doechii built around a chunky sample from Crystal Waters\' 1991 club classic Gypsy Woman, both missed the Billboard Hot 100 entirely. And she\'s run into further troubles with her visuals as well: in August, it was reported that she was under investigation by Spanish officials for allegedly filming the Lifetimes music video in an ecologically sensitive part of the Balearics without permission. A spokesperson for Perry\'s label said the production company responsible for the video had ""assured us all necessary permits for the video were secured"", but it added to the snowballing narrative that Perry’s album rollout has been uncommonly messy.', 'McIntyre believes these singles sound ""kind of dated"" because Perry has failed to move with the times. ""It feels like she\'s trying to engineer a pop song that everyone will like – from 12-year-old kids to their 40-year-old parents,"" he says. Perry may have perfected this formula during her Teenage Dream era, but McIntyre questions whether it is possible to write songs with ""such widespread appeal"" in 2024, when the media is ""much more fractured"". While many Gen X and millennial music fans are still avid radio listeners, consumers from Gen Z and the age group below, Gen Alpha, are probably more likely to discover a song through apps such as TikTok and Spotify.  ', 'Daly also believes that Perry has struggled to adjust to a very different cultural climate. ""Back in 2014, there was a real sense of hope and her bright, bubbly pop matched the mood,"" she says. ""But now, after a global pandemic, years of austerity, and ongoing wars and injustices, it\'s quite the opposite."" Daly argues that Perry\'s new music just doesn\'t fit into a prevailing worldview that is ""more apathetic, nihilistic and hedonistic"".', 'Perry\'s comeback may also have been hampered by a toxic combination of misogyny and ageism that tends to affect female artists over 35: Perry is now 39. This problem was spotlighted in August 2023 when Kylie Minogue\'s viral hit Padam Padam was seemingly snubbed by several youth-oriented UK radio stations and the song\'s producer, Peter Rycroft, claimed this was ""essentially because [Minogue] is an older woman"". Daly argues that ""age is definitely a factor in the reaction to Perry\'s return, whether her critics would admit that or not"". She notes that high-profile female artists ""often face a backlash when they reach a certain age and audiences decide they’re \'trying too hard\' to remain relevant or youthful"".', ""With Perry's new album 143 out today, it remains to be seen whether she can salvage a campaign clouded by negativity. At the same time, it would be foolish to write off Perry, a grafter who has form when it comes to going back to the drawing board. She launched her career in 2001 as the wholesome Christian rock singer Katy Hudson, but when her eponymous debut album barely made a blip, she took stock and re-emerged several years later as the altogether more worldly performer Katy Perry. "", 'She has also displayed at least a partial willingness to acknowledge past mistakes. In the years since its release, her 2008 breakthrough hit I Kissed a Girl has been accused of reinforcing tired bisexual stereotypes with lines such as ""hope my boyfriend don’t mind it"". Last year, Perry admitted she would ""probably make an edit"" if she were writing it now. Davidson suggests that if Perry were to take on board the criticisms aimed at Woman’s World, particularly with regard to its ""half-baked"" attempt to ""jump on a feminist message that no longer feels relevant"", she could potentially ""recalibrate and return with a pop banger that has no agenda other than being a pop banger"". ', 'At present, it seems unlikely that she will address head-on the controversy surrounding her decision to re-team with Dr Luke. During a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Perry sidestepped a question about the ""disappointment"" and ""upset"" this has caused by reaffirming that she is the main creative driving force behind her new album. ""The truth is I wrote these songs from my experience of my whole life going through this metamorphosis. And he was one of the people to help facilitate all that – one of the writers, one of the producers,"" she said. But even so, if Perry can more generally dial up her propensity for self-reflection and make the necessary adjustments, perhaps with the plainspoken clarity she puts into her lyrics, she may get her comeback further down the line.
