What is the U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in Lebanon?,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5150044/un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-united-nations,"['', 'By ', 'Scott Neuman', ""Peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) man an observation point along what's called the Blue Line on the border between Lebanon and Israel, near the southern Lebanese town of Marwahin, on Oct. 12, 2023."", 'As Israel pushes into southern Lebanon with the aim of eliminating Hezbollah fighters and destroying the group’s bases, its forces are increasingly coming into contact with members of a United Nations force that has been in place there for decades with a mandate to maintain peace and security along the volatile border.', 'On Thursday, two peacekeepers from the currently 10,000-strong United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, were injured when an Israeli tank shell hit an observation tower near the ""Blue Line” dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights. The incident followed an Israeli warning for UNIFIL to relocate from areas Israel said were near Hezbollah positions used to launch rockets into northern Israel. UNIFIL refused to evacuate.', 'UNIFIL, in a statement on Thursday, said that its headquarters in Lebanon in the town of Naqoura and nearby peacekeeper positions “have been repeatedly hit” by Israeli tank fire. It said two peacekeepers were injured. And Friday, it said more explosions hit close to an observation tower, wounding two more personnel, but it didn’t blame Israel.', 'The conflict in Lebanon follows more than a year of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas — which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran — in the Gaza Strip. Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking at least 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. As Israel launched its military response in Gaza, Hezbollah militants began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians. In recent weeks, the Israeli military has carried out an air and ground offensive in neighboring Lebanon, an escalation that has drawn alarm from the U.N.', 'Here are a few facts about UNIFIL and its mission:', 'UNIFIL is made up of about 10,000 peacekeeping troops and other personnel from around 50 countries, mostly drawn from Indonesia, India, Ghana, Nepal, Italy, Malaysia, Spain, France, China and Ireland. The U.N. peacekeeping website does not list the United States among them.', ""UNIFIL was created by the U.N. Security Council in 1978 after Israel invaded neighboring Lebanon, following a deadly raid by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon across the border into Israel. Despite the name’s indication that it would be temporary, UNIFIL has become one the longest-serving peacekeeping missions in the world, as NPR's Jane Arraf reported. The Security Council called for Israel’s withdrawal and to help establish “territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries.”"", 'Israel again invaded Lebanon in 1982, kicking off a prolonged occupation until 2000.', 'Then in 2006, after a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militant group whose political wing is a major force in Lebanon, UNIFIL was enlarged and its mandate expanded. The force was tasked with helping Lebanon’s armed forces maintain a buffer between Israel and the so-called Blue Line at the Litani River, about 18 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border.', '', 'UNIFIL’s specific mandate in southern Lebanon was to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore peace and security in the border region and assist the Lebanese government in reestablishing control in the southern part of the country.', ""In the years since, however, the mission has gone beyond that mandate, according to David Schenker, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “They are a primary economic driver in south Lebanon, purchasing supplies, helping the local economy, providing computers for classrooms, for Hezbollah's constituents in south Lebanon, building soccer fields, things that aren't actually included in their mandate, but things they do nonetheless,” he says."", 'UNIFIL’s rules of engagement allow the use of force only if necessary for self-defense or to carry out its duties.', 'No. Although exact figures are hard to come by, a number of UNIFIL peacekeepers have been killed in the line of duty. For example, last year, five men linked to Hezbollah were charged by a Lebanese military tribunal in the killing of an Irish U.N. peacekeeper. Another Irish peacekeeper was seriously wounded in the incident.', 'Normally, UNIFIL plays a role in monitoring and reporting cease-fire violations, providing humanitarian assistance and helping to rebuild infrastructure in southern Lebanon that has been destroyed by decades of fighting. In the absence of direct diplomatic relations between Israel and Lebanon, the peacekeepers have also acted as a liaison of sorts between the two countries. Schenker says before the 2023 Hamas attack in Israel, UNIFIL would sit down about once a month with representatives of the Israeli and Lebanese militaries “to talk about issues of tension, trying to de-escalate, putting mechanisms in place to mediate between the two nominal authorities on the border.” The U.N. force does not communicate directly with Hezbollah, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other countries.', 'But UNIFIL has also been criticized for not doing a better job of monitoring and reporting of Hezbollah violations, allowing the group to remilitarize southern Lebanon, says Schenker, a U.S. diplomat who served in the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The Lebanese government, which includes members of Hezbollah’s political wing, has also circumscribed where peacekeepers can operate, drawing a line around sensitive areas that “basically amount to Hezbollah operational bases in the south,” he says.', 'U.N. peacekeepers from a Spanish brigade of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) clean their weapons at their base close to the Blue Line in August in Kafarkila, Lebanon.', 'Jeffrey Feltman, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, says he doesn’t blame UNIFIL for its limited mandate, but does fault the mission for “its mealymouthed reporting on what Hezbollah was up to.”', ""That’s allowed Hezbollah to reoccupy areas of southern Lebanon that are supposed to be off-limits. As a result many Israelis are skeptical of UNIFIL, according to Paul Salem, vice president for international engagement for the Middle East Institute. Even so, he says “Israel was well aware that Hezbollah had built up capacities in the zone that it wasn't supposed to.”"", 'And for a long time, the border remained relatively calm — until after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack in Israel, that is. “Israel coexisted with that situation and they figured that calm would be maintained long term, both with Hamas [in Gaza] and Hezbollah,” Salem says.', 'Last year’s Hamas attack and the multifront war that has resulted may have permanently changed that.', ""“There has to be something different about the way this war ends than in 2006,” Feltman says. “I don't think it will be a new [U.N.] resolution, but it can't be simply UNIFIL, because the Israelis won't accept that now.”"", ""NPR's Michele Kelemen and Jane Arraf contributed to this report."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

', 'The past year has brought unimaginable suffering. It has been one year since the horrendous attack by Hamas and other armed groups in Israel. And rockets continue to be fired indiscriminately into Israel.', 'Few times in recent history have we witnessed suffering and destruction of the size, scale, and scope that we see in Gaza. In the past year, this Council has been briefed repeatedly on the horror unfolding in Gaza, at least monthly on average. ', 'Once again, we find ourselves at a critical juncture. Unfortunately, much of what I am about to say mirrors what we reported a month ago. Widespread suffering persists while the humanitarian situation worsens. ', 'The recent evacuation orders by Israeli authorities for large areas of northern Gaza, along with intensified ground operations, risk more death, destruction and yet another mass displacement of civilians.  ', 'Once again, utter chaos ensues as the world watches on. ', 'Before we turn to the situation, we express, deep concern about the ongoing legislation to stop the activities of UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency]. This would be disastrous for the provision of aid and essential services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. ', 'Nearly every one of the more than 2 million people in Gaza receives some form of aid or service provision from UNRWA, along with nearly one million Palestine refugees in the West Bank. If approved, such legislation would diametrically be opposed to the UN Charter and in violation of Israel’s obligations under international law. ', 'Madam President,', 'Over the past year, relentless Israeli-issued displacement orders have affected almost 84 per cent of Gaza’s territory. Around 90 percent of Gaza’s population is internally displaced.', 'Hundreds of thousands of people are pressured to move south to Al Mawasi, but southern Gaza cannot accommodate more people.  ', 'In Al Mawasi – where civilians were told to go –12 Palestinians were reportedly killed and at least 26 others injured when two tents were struck in the camp at Al Mawasi on 1 October.', 'Evacuation orders are meant to protect civilians, but the exact opposite is happening. As we have said so many times, there is no safe place in Gaza.', 'Three of the ten partially functional hospitals in the north have been ordered to evacuate all patients without providing alternatives for relocating them. We have not been able to get fuel to other hospitals in the north.', 'There has been no electricity since October last year. Without electricity, or fuel for the generators, everything shuts down: medical facilities, water, sanitation, and other essential services.', 'And bakeries are closing, deepening the already high levels of food insecurity. ', 'As this conflict persists, civilians must have the essentials for their survival. They must be allowed to seek protection. Those displaced must be guaranteed the right to voluntarily return.', 'Madam President, ', 'Severe impediments on the entry of essential commercial supplies and humanitarian access continue.  ', 'For instance, in September, humanitarian workers spent a total of 212 hours – that’s nearly 9 days’ worth of waiting -- to receive a green light from Israeli authorities to undertake life-saving missions.', 'And in the past week, there have been no humanitarian movements to the north, while both land crossings have been closed for supplies entering Zikim and Erez. ', 'The north of Gaza has been cut off, putting at risk the second round of the polio vaccination campaign, scheduled for mid-October.  ', 'Further, essential commercial supplies entering Gaza have drastically reduced in the past week. ', 'In recent days, on average 50 truckloads of goods enter each day– quantities that do not begin to meet needs. Humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for the flow of commercial goods; and vice-versa. ', 'Aid workers are only able to deliver a trickle of humanitarian aid through Israeli checkpoints.', 'These are life threatening restrictions. ', 'People are traumatized, hungry, digging with their bare hands in rubble for their loved ones. ', 'They are increasingly frustrated about the international community’s failure to stop the hostilities. And, as the situation worsens, this anger is increasingly being directed at humanitarian workers.', 'The lack of adequate humanitarian access means that food insecurity and diseases are spreading fast.  ', 'The severe lack of shelter supplies is likely to worsen health conditions and further undermine the dignity of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions, this coming winter.', 'Humanitarian partners report that women and children are hard-hit by the trauma of this war.', 'Each day, according to UNRWA,10 children are losing one or both of their legs. Gaza is home to the largest cohort of child amputees in modern history.  Women are three times more likely to miscarry, and three times more likely to die from childbirth.', 'And, yet humanitarians are not giving up. ', 'Madam President,', 'We also remain deeply concerned about the worsening situation in the West Bank.', 'Over the past year, Israeli military operations, along with rampant settler violence and house demolitions, have led to a sharp rise in fatalities, widespread destruction and forced displacement. ', 'Just last week, on 4 October, 18 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed in an airstrike on a residential building in Tulkarm refugee camp; this was the single deadliest incident carried out by Israeli forces in the West Bank since OCHA began systematically documenting casualties in 2005.', 'In the West Bank, the use of lethal force must comply with international human rights law and the standards governing law enforcement. Tactics typically used during hostilities in armed conflict raise concerns about the excessive use of force.', 'We urge full respect for international law and compliance with the determinations of the International Court of Justice. ', 'Maximum influence must be exerted to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.', 'We cannot claim ignorance to what is happening—nor can we afford to look away.', 'That is why we repeat our calls for the Security Council, and Member States, to take action.', 'This includes ensuring respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law by exerting necessary pressure and cooperating in pursuing accountability for international crimes.', 'This means ensuring that all hostages are released.', 'This means ensuring civilians are protected, and their essential needs for survival met, wherever they are, whether they evacuate or not. ', 'This means ensuring that humanitarian operations are protected and facilitated, including in accordance with the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice, for all civilians in need.', 'Urgent diplomatic efforts are needed to de-escalate the situation in the Occupied Palestinian ', 'Territory and to prevent a wider regional descent into bloodshed.

Three days later, Israel invaded Lebanon in an effort to push the PLO back over the Litani and away from its northern border.', 'In response, the UN Security Council (UNSC) called on Israel to withdraw and set up UNIFIL. Its remit was to confirm Israel’s withdrawal, restore peace and security, and assist Lebanon’s government regain effective authority in the south – a rather difficult aspiration, since Lebanon was then three years into its long-running civil war, a power struggle between Shi’ite and Sunni Muslims, Christians, and Palestinians.', 'Following the arrival of UNIFIL, Israel withdrew from most of the territory it had occupied. It left its Christian militia allies, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), in control of a strip of territory well south of the Litani River, in which they established a “security zone.” They maintained this until Israel’s full withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000.', 'Despite the presence of UNIFIL, which seemed incapable of exercising any sort of control, the PLO quickly reestablished itself south of the Litani, and continued launching cross-border attacks and rocket fire into northern Israel.

', 'Israeli troops crossed the Lebanese border, advanced up the country, and soon reached Beirut. They captured PLO headquarters there and ordered the PLO out of the country. ', 'The PLO’S departure did not, unfortunately, mean that UNIFIL could be disbanded. In that same year, Hezbollah was founded with the active support with the active support of Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). ', 'Its declared prime purpose was to remove Israel, and all other foreign entities, from Lebanese soil. It launched its first attack on the IDF in November 1982.', 'UNIFIL’s mandate did not directly include confronting non-state militias – a factor that has doubtless contributed to UNFILF’s ineffectiveness over the years.

', 'As a result, its presence in ever-increasing numbers has done nothing to prevent Hezbollah from taking over the whole of south Lebanon, and allowing it to become the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor, with much of its arsenal concentrated in UNIFIL’s area of operations.', 'UNIFIL’s mandate has to be renewed on an annual basis. During a visit to Israel in late November 2023, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto called for a “thorough reevaluation” of UNIFIL’s mission, citing cross-border attacks on Israel by Hezbollah as an indication that the peacekeeping mission was not working as intended. ', 'The “rules of engagement need to change,” he said. Nevertheless, in August UNFIL’s mandate was again renewed with no significant changes beyond a renewed emphasis on the need for coordination between UNIFIL and the Lebanese government.', 'Once again Hezbollah, the real malign power in Lebanon, did not feature in the resolution.', 'There are some 10,000 UNIFIL troops deployed across southern Lebanon. ', 'They have done virtually nothing to control the persistent bombardment of Israel over the past year or to fulfill their remit to restore Lebanese governance south of the Litani. ', 'Since Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah has maintained a persistent bombardment of northern Israel and up to 80,000 people have had to evacuate their homes. ', 'There could therefore have been little surprise in UNIFIL headquarters when, on September 30, the IDF notified the force commander of their intention to undertake limited ground incursions into Lebanon. ', 'Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the UN undersecretary-general for peace operations, told reporters that UNIFIL will remain in its positions in south Lebanon despite Israel’s request that it vacate some areas before it launched its ground operation against Hezbollah. ', 'By staying put, UNIFIL is exposing its troops to possible collateral death or injury; indeed, two peacekeepers were injured when IDF fire damaged a UNIFIL observation post on October 9. ', 'Having failed notably over decades to fulfill its peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL now has units scattered across a battlefield and has turned into a liability.

The IDF said that the incident took place during an attempt to evacuate wounded IDF soldiers under fire.', 'In urging that members of UNIFIL be moved out of harm’s way, Netanyahu said that previous similar pleas by Israel had been refused, despite a rising number of injuries to UNIFIL troops.', 'The international force has already said that it will stay put.', 'Addressing UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Netanyahu said in a Hebrew-language message, “It is time for you to withdraw UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the areas of combat.”', '“The IDF has repeatedly asked for this, and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists,” he added.', '“Mr. Secretary General, get the UNIFIL forces out of harm’s way.

vicinity of UNIFIL posts, according to an Israeli readout of a call between the two.', 'The US readout said that Austin expressed “deep concern” about reports that Israeli forces had fired on UN peacekeeping positions and urged Israel to ensure safety for them and the Lebanese military.', 'Austin “reinforced the need to pivot from military operations in Lebanon to a diplomatic pathway as soon as feasible,” according to the Pentagon statement released early Sunday.', 'Also Sunday, Pope Francis asked for “respect” for UN peacekeepers.', '“I am close to all the people involved, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, where I ask that the UN peacekeepers be respected,” Francis said at the Vatican and called for “an immediate ceasefire on all fronts, that the paths of diplomacy and dialogue be

country’s south.', '“There was a unanimous decision to stay because it’s important for the UN flag to still fly high in this region, and to be able to report to the Security Council,” he told AFP in an interview.', 'Before the war escalated in late September, Hezbollah had launched rockets and drones regularly over the border, and Israel had retaliated with airstrikes at the sources of fire, meaning the Blue Helmets had already been spending a lot of time in bunkers, Tenenti said.', '“For many months, they have been living in these conditions.”', 'Despite all this, he said, “the channel of communication is still open with the parties,” Tenenti said.', 'Michael Higgins, the president of Ireland, which has troops in the mission, had earlier said Israel was “demanding that the entire

the 33-day Second Lebanon War in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah.', 'Its role was bolstered by UN Security Council Resolution 1701 of that year, which stipulated that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers be deployed in southern Lebanon.', 'However, that resolution has largely gone unimplemented as Hezbollah entrenched itself in the border area over the past 18 years, storing weapons there, and in recent months, firing countless rockets into Israel and allegedly positioning its forces for a mass invasion of Israel last year.', 'Last week UNIFIL said that Israeli tank fire caused two Indonesian peacekeepers to fall off a watchtower in Naqura.', 'The following day, it said explosions close to an observation tower in Naqura wounded two Sri Lankan Blue Helmets, while Israel said it had responded to an “immediate threat” near a UN peacekeeping position.', 'On Saturday, UNIFIL said a peacekeeper in Naqura “was hit by gunfire” on Friday night.', 'Since October 8, 2023, Hezbollah-led forces have attacked Israeli communities and military posts along the border on a near-daily basis, with the group saying it is doing so to support its ally Hamas amid the war in Gaza following the Palestinian terror group’s October 7 massacre in southern Israel.', 'Some 60,000 residents of northern Israel were evacuated from towns near the Lebanon border shortly after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught, amid fears Hezbollah would carry out a similar attack and increasing rocket fire by the terror group.', 'Late last month, Israel launched a ground operation in southern Lebanon,
