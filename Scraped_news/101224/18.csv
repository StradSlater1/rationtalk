"Israelis Burn up Refugee Tents in Central Gaza, as they Plan Ethnic Cleansing of North",https://www.juancole.com/2024/10/israelis-refugee-cleansing.html,"['', '', '', 'JUAN COLE\n10/14/2024', 'Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – One reason why Palestinians in northern Gaza are resisting attempts of the Israelis to expel hundreds of thousands of them from what is left of their residences is that the center and the south of the country are still being indiscriminately bombarded by the Israeli military. Early on Monday morning (today), the Israeli army shelled the courtyard of al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Gaza Strip, setting fire to refugee tents there. Initial reports said that 3 people were killed and 40 injured, though observers expect the casualty toll to climb. Some images from the scene released on social media showed patients in the courtyard hooked up to IV drips being engulfed by flames.', 'Israeli attacks on hospitals are common. The UN High Commission on Human Rights has accused Israeli authorities of deliberately destroying the medical infrastructure of Gaza.', 'Al Jazeera English: “Four killed in Israeli drone attack on Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital”', '', 'Meawhile, Israeli shelling of a school at the Nuseirat Camp in central Gaza killed 15 children and a woman and injured 80 others. Israel has bombarded 191 displacement centers in Gaza during the past year, presumably because their automated attack programs, Lavender and Go Daddy, discovered known members of al-Qassam Brigades there, and hit them without regard for the civilians around them.', 'The Israelis also bombed the Mufti School in Nuseirat Camp, where thousands of displaced children and women had sought shelter.', 'Haaretz reports that senior Israeli military officers are saying privately that the negotiations for the release of the remaining 101 Israeli hostages in Gaza are being abandoned and that Israel will seek to seize substantial portions of the Gaza Strip. The annexation of territory by military force is forbidden by the United Nations Charter, to which Israel is a signatory.', 'The officers, reports Yaniv Kubovich, said that the recent offensive in North Gaza was launched without consultations. That statement is likely a code for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and hardliners on his cabinet ordering the army in abruptly and without military rationale. The officers seemed confused about why the Israeli government is expelling the 400,000 Palestinians of Gaza from the north. Israel had announced months ago that Hamas was cleared from North Gaza.', 'Kubovich wonders if the current North Gaza campaign is intended to implement the “surrender or starve strategy” that had been proposed by retired General Giora Eiland, which envisaged that all inhabitants of northern Gaza would be expelled to the south. Anyone who declined to leave would be deemed Hamas and could be legitimately targeted and cut entirely off from food and other humanitarian aid. Only the Palestinians who allowed themselves to be pushed out of their homes and who risked random Israeli bombardment could hope to get so much as an occasional meal in the south of the Strip.', 'The new campaign against the civilian population of northern Gaza involved ordering the 162nd Division to relocate from southern Gaza to the north. There, it was positioned to launch a wider-ranging attack on the Jabalia refugee camp. Kubovich reports that military circles do not see a military justification for this campaign.', 'Ground and air operations against Jabalia have been ongoing for the past week, as Israeli officers demanded everyone leave, which one volunteer French nurse on the ground called “a direct death sentence” on the 400,000 civilians. On Saturday, an Israeli bombardment killed 22 and wounded more than 90 persons, including women and children, according to Al Jazeerah', 'Expulsion of an occupied population is a crime against humanity according to International Humanitarian Law, including the Rome Statute that underlies the International Criminal Court. The ICC prosecutor has asked for warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu and the International Court of Justice is considering a case brought by South Africa against Israel charging it with the commission of genocide in Gaza.', 'Filed Under: Featured, Israel/ Palestine', 'Juan Cole is the founder and chief editor of Informed Comment.

IDF returns to northern Gaza’s Jabaliya neighborhood,https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2024/10/idf-returns-to-northern-gazas-jabaliya-neighborhood.php,"['The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expanded operations in northern Gaza overnight between October 5 and October 6, sending tanks and infantry into Jabliya, a suburb of Gaza City. It is the third time the IDF has operated in this neighborhood. The return of troops to northern Gaza comes as Hamas is seeking to rebuild its forces, and terrorist groups in Gaza launched rockets at southern Israel. The operation also started a day before Israel commemorates Hamas’s terrorist attack on October 7, 2023.', 'The IDF’s 162nd Division is leading operations in Jabliya. It had been deployed in Rafah between May and October, where it was responsible for eliminating more than 1,000 terrorists and securing the road along the Egyptian border called the Philadelphi Corridor.', 'The decision to send the 162nd Division into Jabliya was made as the IDF continued operating in Lebanon, which limits the regular army units it can deploy into Gaza. Israel currently uses reserve infantry and armored forces to secure the Netzarim Corridor south of Gaza City and other troops to secure the Philadelphi route in southern Gaza. The current operations in Gaza are vastly scaled-down compared to those during the first six months of the war.', 'Hamas has returned to Jabaliya, a repeated pattern in most of Gaza whenever Israeli forces withdraw. The IDF has preferred not to control dense urban areas for very long. Instead, troops go in and eliminate terrorists, tunnels, and related terror infrastructure before leaving and then often returning.', 'This is the third time the IDF has operated in Jabliya in a year. Israeli forces operated there in the opening campaign from November to January and again in May for several weeks. In May, the 98th Division cleared Jabliya. Now, the 98th fights in Lebanon while the 162nd conducts the current operations in the northern Gaza neighborhood. The 162nd includes the 401st Armored Brigade, which led the first offensive into northern Gaza on October 27 and has been fighting in the strip for a year.', 'Before the movement of infantry and tanks into Jabliya, the IDF conducted an airstrike on a Hamas command-and-control center in the suburb, the IDF said on October 5. “The command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served as a UNRWA center, was used by the Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terrorist attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel.” At night, the soldiers moved in. The IDF said it had detected “efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area.”', 'As the IDF moved into Jabaliya, it also announced an expansion of the Mawasi Humanitarian Area on the coast of the Gaza Strip. This change may be in the expectation that many civilians will flee from northern Gaza towards the south. The IDF says it has created two humanitarian evacuation routes from Gaza’s north, one on Salah al-Din, the main road that leads from Gaza City to the south, and another on the Rashid coastal road.', 'On October 6, Hamas launched rockets towards areas near the Gaza border, indicating it continues to possess these threats in the short and perhaps medium ranges. “A projectile was intercepted, and the rest fell in open areas,” the IDF said.', 'During the first week of October, the IDF also carried out a number of airstrikes against Hamas members it accused of using schools to hide their activities. In one case, the Khalifa bin Zayed School in the northern Gaza Strip was struck. The IDF said it was a Hamas command-and-control center. Another of these sites was found in the Ibn Rushd School Deir al Balah and also hit, the IDF said. In a third instance, the IDF conducted an airstrike on the Ahmad al-Kurd School in central Gaza. In each case, the IDF says it takes measures to avoid civilian casualties.', 'The IDF, including Southern Command, is also preparing for October 7 anniversary memorial events in anticipation of the possibility Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad may carry out attacks. “Ahead of the October 7th commemoration events, a detailed combat readiness plan was implemented. The IDF’s Gaza Division has been reinforced with several platoons, with forces stationed to defend both the communities and the border area,” the IDF said.', '“This is a long war, measured not only by capabilities but also by the willpower and perseverance over time. For our enemies—every month, every week, and every day is worse than the one before. Even after the campaign ends, we will need to maintain our achievements, and our enemies will know, beyond any doubt, there will be no revival for those who seek to destroy us,” IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said on October 6. “A year has passed, and we have defeated the military wing of Hamas, and we continue to fight against the organization’s terrorist capabilities,” he noted.', 'The IDF also released new footage from the October 7 attack related to fighting by the IDF’s Multidimensional Unit. Part of the 99th Division, this unit fought in Erez, Urim, Re’im, Be’eri, Alumim, and Nahal Oz.', 'Israel’s military also established a new exhibition of weapons and other gear that was found on terrorists after the attack. “The display includes vehicles and equipment used by the terrorists on October 7th to infiltrate into Israel, including pickup trucks, motorcycles, tractors, uniforms, intelligence documents, and the terrorists’ weapons including anti-tank missiles, RPG rockets, missiles, explosives, and UAVs of the Hamas terrorist organization.” The tally includes 70,000 items, including 1,250 anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs).', ""Reporting from Israel, Seth J.
