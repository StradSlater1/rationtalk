Trump announces Operation Aurora to tamp down illegal immigration in Colorado,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3186372/trump-announces-operation-aurora-tamp-down-illegal-immigration-colorado/,"['Former President Donald Trump announced Friday that if he won a second term, he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 under a program he has dubbed “Operation Aurora” to deport immigrant gang members.\n\nTrump, who is campaigning in Aurora, Colorado, said that the operation would “expedite the removal of these savage gangs” and called “for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.”', '2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE', 'The rally, while not in a state that is one of the seven battleground states that will decide the election, featured Trump repeatedly railing against the illegal immigration crisis at the southern border and casting blame on Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) over the alleged Venezuelan gangs overtaking Aurora.', 'But Republican Mayor Mike Coffman and local police have disputed Trump’s claims.', 'The visit to the state that will likely not vote for Trump is meant to appeal to voters in battleground swing states such as Arizona, which shares a border with Colorado.', 'The former president repeatedly warned their communities could be overtaken by immigrants who entered the nation illegally if Harris is elected.', '“Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World,” Trump said on Friday, blaming Harris for the illegal immigration crisis and denouncing her as the “border czar.”', '“She has had them resettled beautifully into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens,” Trump said. “That’s what they’re doing, and no place is it more evident than right here, because in Aurora, multiple apartment complexes have been taken over by the savage Venezuela prison gang known as Tren de Aragua.”', 'In a reprise of his usual campaign stump speech, Trump said he would solve the crisis.', '“I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump told the crowd. “These towns have been conquered. Explain that to your governor — he doesn’t have a clue they’ve been conquered. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country.”', 'But before Trump’s visit, Coffman, the mayor of Aurora, took to Facebook to say that Aurora is a “safe city.”', '“The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated. The incidents were limited to several apartment complexes in this city of more than 400,000 residents,” Coffman said.', 'Coffman, along with Aurora Council Member and Public Safety Chairwoman Danielle Jurinsky, another Republican, previously rebuked Trump over the Tren de Aragua gang claims he made during the presidential debate last month.', '“TdA has not “taken over” the city. The overstated claims fueled by social media and through select news organizations are simply not true,” the pair wrote in a statement. “To date, APD has now linked 10 people to TdA and has arrested eight of those people.”', 'Trump also blasted Polis over Colorado’s attempts to remove him from the primary ballot over his actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which the Supreme Court overturned in March.', '“It was Polis who led the move to take me off the ballot because I was leading in the polls against all of the Democrats,” Trump said before asking the crowd to vote for him in the reliably blue state.', 'The effort to remove Trump was led by the left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, which brought the case to Colorado last year.', 'CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER ', '“So I think Colorado will show a tremendous protest vote for what they did to try and keep me off the ballot and, more importantly, what they have done to the fabric of your culture,” Trump said. “And remember, I believe Colorado is, you know, we’re very close. We’re very close.”', 'Harris sat down for a town hall with the Spanish-language television network Univision, where she discussed the “broken immigration system” of the United States and blamed Trump for scuttling a border security bill.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

JD Vance, also have spread falsehoods about a community in Springfield, Ohio, where they said Haitian immigrants were accused of stealing and eating pets.', 'While Ohio and Colorado are not competitive in the presidential race, the Republican message on immigration is intended for states that are. Vance campaigned recently in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a city of 70,000 that has resettled refugees from Africa and Asia, and touted Trump’s plan to ramp up deportations. He argues smaller communities have been “overrun” by immigrants taxing local resources.', 'Trump has vowed to deport not only “criminal,” a promise he shares with Harris, but also Haitians living legally in Springfield and even people he has denigrated as “pro-Hamas radicals” protesting on college campuses.

Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end. But all options are on the table.”', 'Harris charged that Trump “did nothing” after Iranian-backed militias attacked U.S. bases and American troops.', 'But Trump in fact during his time in office had ordered strikes against Iranian backed militias as well as a January 2020 operation that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force.', 'Harris participated virtually in a White House briefing with President Biden on the recovery effort from hurricanes Milton and Helene.

Around a dozen people with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang have been arrested for a range of crimes in the metro area.', 'But the city’s Republican mayor complains the situation has been overblown for political gain and residents say the attention has led to racist threats and intimidation against them.', 'In his remarks, Trump declared, “I love this state. This state has to flip Republican,” to raucous cheers. ', 'He said he could be spending time on the most beautiful beaches in the world but instead, he came to Colorado to figure out what “the hell happened to Aurora.” ', 'He blasted Gov. Jared Polis, referring to him as a coward, a fraud and pathetic. He also blamed Vice-President Kamala Harris for the surge in new immigrants arriving in the country in the past two years. ', '“Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the third world,” said Trump. “And she has had them resettled, beautifully, into your community to prey upon innocent American citizens, that’s what they’re doing. And no place is it more evident than right here.”', ""Researchers have repeatedly found that immigrants, whether or not they are documented, don't commit crimes at higher rates. City officials have repeatedly denied that the gang controls any building or part of the city, as have many residents of the affected buildings. "", 'Of the tens of thousands of new immigrants who have come through Colorado in the past two years, local law enforcement say they’ve arrested around a dozen with suspected gang ties.', 'Trump announced if re-elected, he would target migrants for mass arrests and deportation and call the effort “Operation Aurora.” He said he’d rely on the Alien and Sedition Act for his legal authority. The 1798 law allows a president wide powers to detain and remove foreign nationals from countries judged to have invaded the United States. ', 'Late in the speech he also declared, “I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American citizen.” The line received some of the loudest cheers of the rally.', 'Trump paused his remarks to show television clips including Fox News segments about migrant crime.  ', '“They burst into a building and held tenants at gunpoint and knifepoint,” Trump said. He also talked more broadly about migrants from all over the world.', '“Our criminals are like babies compared to these people. These criminals are the most violent people on earth.”  ', 'Cindy Romero, the woman who posted the viral video that sparked the entire controversy in Aurora, briefly joined Trump on stage. Trump called her brave and applauded her for posting the video. ', 'Democrats offered their own pre-rebuttal to Trump’s visit and message about Aurora in the city, speaking Friday morning several miles closer to the apartments than the former president at Stanley Marketplace.', 'Sen. Michael Bennet was blunt in his assessment of the visit. “Donald Trump has invited himself to Aurora to do what Donald Trump does best, which is to demonize immigrants, to lie and to serve his own political purposes.”', 'Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, an Army veteran who lives in and represents Aurora, defended his community.  “We know in Aurora that our vibrancy, our strength, our culture, so much of who we are … are drawn from that beautiful heritage of immigration.”', 'Crow also wanted to set the record straight.  He said he’s spoken with local law enforcement and there is no uptick in transnational gang activity in this area. ', '“What is occurring is minimal and isolated and, to be clear, never acceptable,” Crow said. “But it’s not a surge, it’s not a change. There is no takeover of any part of this city, of any apartment complex. It has not happened. It is a lie.”', 'Gov. Jared Polis acknowledged that there are victims of crime in Aurora, but noted that statistics show the city has gotten safer over the last two years. He also pointed out that the city’s mayor, Republican Mike Coffman, has “called out the former president’s lies and distortions about Aurora.”', '“It really just shows, as a matter of character, that very often when he speaks, former President Trump doesn’t seem to care who he hurts with his words and his rhetoric or the consequences of what he says,” Polis added.', 'Crow added Trump is using Aurora, “because they see an opportunity to try to lie and distort the situation.”', 'Crow held a round table with recent immigrants the day before the rally and said many told him that they were afraid that anti-immigrant feelings have increased.', 'Sen. John Hickenlooper and Denver Rep. Diana DeGette also spoke up in defense of Aurora and criticized Trump’s inaccurate description of the community and its newest members.', ""After the speech, Aurora's Republican mayor, Mike Coffman said he was disappointed Trump hadn't taken the opportunity to see the reality of the city."", '""The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity in our city – and our state – have been grossly exaggerated and have unfairly hurt the city’s identity and sense of safety,"" Coffman said in a statement. ""The city and state have not been “taken over” or “invaded” or “occupied” by migrant gangs. The incidents that have occurred in Aurora, a city of 400,000 people, have been limited to a handful of specific apartment complexes, and our dedicated police officers have acted on those concerns and will continue to do so.""', 'Multiple Colorado congressional candidates and representatives spoke at the rally ahead of Trump. Gabe Evans, the Republican running for CD 8 spoke about his race, one of the key seats the GOP hopes to flip in November. ', 'Jeff Crank, the candidate for CO-5 in Colorado Springs, and Rep. Greg Lopez, who currently represents CO-4, both spoke about the border, crime rates and drugs. They shared their concerns for those issues across the state and in their districts. ', 'Congresswoman Lauren Boebert had arguably the biggest responses from the crowd. She called on residents of Aurora to vote for John Fabbricatore, a former high-ranking ICE official who is the GOP candidate for District 6. ', 'Boebert got the crowd to chant, “Move that bus” referring to the removal of migrants. ', 'At one point Boebert said “Illegal immigrants, they deserve one thing… a one-way ticket home,” to loud cheers in the crowd. ', 'Harriet Hageman, a Congresswoman from Wyoming, spoke as well as the Colorado Republican Chair, Dave Williams. They called on the crowd to support Trump and to ensure Republican influence in Colorado.', 'As he took the stage, Trump shouted out Boebert, Lopez and Hageman, and endorsed Evans, Fabbricatore and Crank for Congress.', 'While Trump and others were speaking at the Gaylord, Rick Martinez was holding a one-person rally in front of the Edge at Lowry, the apartment complex that was oftentimes the center of Trump’s speech. ', 'Wearing a shirt depicting a hand shushing Trump and holding a sign urging readers to vote for Kamala Harris, Martinez, a resident of West Denver, said he felt compelled to travel to the apartment complex because he disagreed with Trump’s rhetoric that Aurora has been “invaded” by immigrants. ', ""“It's just sad that he would make a mockery out of these people and make them look like they're such a bad group of people that are coming over here from Venezuela, traveling thousands of miles just to get to another country, to have a better chance at life for their kids and their families,” Martinez said. "", 'Martinez, who by 1:30 p.m. had spent about an hour and a half in front of the apartment complex, said he hadn’t seen anything he thought was out of the ordinary. He said he held polite conversations with residents and neighbors, many of whom don’t speak fluent English. ', 'Aside from Martinez, the complex was relatively quiet. From some windows, many of which were broken and shoddily repaired with makeshift cardboard barriers, sounds of children playing could be heard. Residents came and went from their buildings, avoiding a small group of reporters waiting outside the apartments.

With approximately 43,000 migrants flooding the neighboring city of Denver since December 2022, many of these migrants have made their way to Aurora, bringing chaos and fear with them. Local families have been forced to flee their homes as Tren de Aragua members terrorize apartment complexes with guns, theft, and rampant drug activity. Kamala Harris’ open-border policies are turning once-safe communities into nightmares for law-abiding citizens.\n\nDenver, just 15 miles away and a sanctuary city, is buckling under the strain of illegal immigrants who have overwhelmed the city’s safety-net hospital. In one year alone, the hospital spent a staggering $10 million on 20,000 visits by illegal migrants. Emergency room visits by Venezuelans in Denver surged by 6,000 percent, further depleting already scarce resources.\n\nTren de Aragua gang members infiltrated multiple apartment complexes in Aurora. Aurora police have linked at least 10 individuals to the Tren de Aragua gang, with eight of them already arrested for crimes ranging from shootings to assaults. These violent criminals are destroying the safety and security of Aurora’s apartment complexes, and yet, the Harris-Biden administration continues to allow illegal immigrants to cross the borders unchecked.\n\nKamala’s border bloodbath has made every state a border state, leaving Colorado families at the mercy of criminals.

The repeat Republican presidential nominee promised to use the death penalty on migrants who kill American citizens and said he would dust off a 200-year-old law previously used to create the Japanese internment camps.', '“We will send elite squads of ICE, border patrol and federal enforcement officers to hunt down, arrest, and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left,” the former president said to cheers, invoking authorities that included U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.', 'Trump spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes in the Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center, 15 minutes from Denver’s airport on the northern edge of Aurora. The rally was 12 miles or more away from the dilapidated apartment complexes that sparked a national firestorm and drew Trump to Colorado.', 'Much of his speech in the mostly full ballroom, which had a capacity of 10,000, focused on illegal immigration. His lectern was flanked by mugshots of Venezuelan gang members arrested in Aurora, and the two large screens next to him recurringly played news montages describing crimes allegedly committed by migrants across America.', 'He promised to launch “Operation Aurora” as president. He said it would involve invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country that the U.S. is at war with. Trump said he would use it to “expedite the removal of the savage gangs.” The law previously was used to establish American internment camps in World War II, in which thousands of Japanese-Americans were detained. One of the camps, the Granada Relocation Center, also known as Amache, was located in southeastern Colorado.', 'As Trump spoke, members of the thousands-strong audience yelled “Deport them!” and “Send them back!” Many waved signs that read “Secure our border.”', 'Immigration is a key issue for Republicans this cycle as they criticize the record of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.

The city and state have not been ‘taken over’ or ‘invaded’ or ‘occupied’ by migrant gangs.”', 'City officials have said a transnational Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua has “significantly affected” several neglected apartment buildings in town; they’ve also said the gang’s presence in the city is limited and that at least nine of 10 identified members have been arrested.', 'On Friday, Trump falsely stated that the city had been “conquered.”', 'Tenants in the apartments, as well as years of inspection reports and lawsuits, say that neglect by the properties’ owners left the buildings infested with mold and rodents, often lacking heat and sagging from water leaks and faulty infrastructure.', 'In the afternoon, tenants of buildings at one of those complexes on North Dallas Street gathered with advocates and castigated Trump’s rhetoric. He and others, in targeting all migrants, are “villainizing folks because they had the audacity to seek something better for their family,” said state Rep. Tim Hernández, a Democrat.', 'Four hours before Trump took the stage, Gov.

Jason Crow, who represents Aurora in Congress, added. “We will not tolerate it.”', 'Though immigration dominated the speech, Trump touched on other favorite personal and Republican talking points. He floated pulling the broadcasting license from CBS and played a clip contrasting footage from the fictional film “Full Metal Jacket,” about Marines training for and then serving in Vietnam, with social media videos showing members of the military dressed in drag.', 'That prompted another wave of boos.', 'He repeatedly criticized Polis, to more boos, and falsely blamed the Democratic governor for a lawsuit that sought to disqualify Trump from the ballot here for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The lawsuit was brought by a group of unaffiliated and Republican voters and aided by a liberal watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. The Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling on the grounds it is a federal, not state-level, issue.', 'Trump also suggested that Colorado, a solidly blue state that backed Biden by more than 13 percentage points four years ago, could turn red in November.', '“I really believe Colorado is — we’re very close. We’re very close,” Trump said. Recent public polling shows Harris with a double-digit lead over the former president.', 'Even if Colorado is unlikely to shake the deeper-blue coloring it has adopted since Trump entered his first presidential race nearly a decade ago, he still commanded significant support Friday.', 'The line to enter the ballroom snaked out of the Gaylord’s parking lot and down the street, at one point stretching more than a mile.

One man, holding a Trump flag, yelled homophobic slurs at the counter-protesters.', 'McClung, who’s lived in Aurora for 29 years, came with her roommate to protest.', '“It is a much bigger turnout than I expected it to be,” she said of rally-goers.', 'Inside, as Trump wound down his rally on the day that Colorado clerks began mailing ballots to voters for the Nov. 5 election, he urged people to vote and — returning to previous descriptions of the state’s third-largest city as a “war zone” — promised to “liberate Colorado.”', '“We will reclaim our sovereignty,” he said, “and Colorado will vote for Trump as a protest and signal to the world that we are not going to take it anymore.”', 'Staff reporter Jessica Alvarado Gamez contributed to this story.', 'Stay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.', '', '', '', 'Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group']"

Trump’s Dangerous Immigration Obsession,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/10/14/trumps-dangerous-immigration-obsession,"['', '', 'Donald Trump’s most outrageous pronouncements on immigration are rarely shocking for long; they’re usually eclipsed within days, if not hours, by even more grotesque claims. Last year, in what should have been an enduring political scandal, Trump blamed immigrants for “poisoning the blood of our country.” He has repeated his solution—mass deportation—so often that it’s become a campaign slogan. In a national Scripps News/Ipsos poll last month, fifty-four per cent of those asked agreed, either “strongly” or “somewhat,” with Trump’s call, including a quarter of Democrats. Maybe people can’t imagine what an action like that would entail; or, worse, maybe they can.', 'Either way, the acceptance of such hostile thinking is, at least in part, a function of how relentlessly Trump and his running mate, J. D. Vance, lay all America’s problems at immigrants’ feet. Mass deportation isn’t just their immigration platform; it’s their response to questions about affordable housing, the economy, and inflation. Last month, Trump said of undocumented immigrants that “getting them out will be a bloody story.” There was hardly time to parse his meaning before he was standing on a Presidential-debate stage, in Philadelphia, lying about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. Those remarks, compounded by Vance, were followed by a period of local terror that has included bomb scares, classroom evacuations, and pleas for sanity from the state’s Republican governor. All the while, Trump continued to fulminate on the stump. “These migrants,” he said at a rally in Wisconsin, “are stone-cold killers. They’ll walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat.” Last Thursday, in Michigan, he claimed that the government wasn’t providing relief after Hurricane Helene, because Kamala Harris and the Democrats “stole the fema money” so that they “could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them.”', 'The daily stream of racism and mendacity has had a numbing effect. What hasn’t Trump said at this point? But the question of what he might actually do, should he win, is a prospect that voters cannot afford to ignore. Trump’s top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, has announced that, if the former President is reëlected, the government will deport a million people a year. Given the expense and the bureaucratic complexity alone, this projection appears unrealistic, yet that scarcely makes it less dangerous.', 'Last summer, Jason Houser, who served as a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Biden Administration, tried to map out what, logistically, a mass-deportation program might look like. His main focus was on the early days, when Trump wouldn’t have nearly enough detention space to hold those apprehended in nationwide sweeps. While the Administration ramped up its capabilities, it could compensate by instilling fear. If enough people were intimidated, some might feel that they had no choice but to leave the country. The guiding idea, as Houser saw it, would be to weaponize ice against families in order to inflict maximum pain in the most conspicuous way. “This won’t just be something at the border,” he said. “It’ll be boys and girls in your kid’s classes at school who just stop showing up.”', 'There are more than eleven million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and government agents have enormous latitude in whom they decide to arrest. Current policy discourages ice from apprehending anyone at hospitals, schools, or places of worship. As a top adviser at the White House during Trump’s Presidency, Miller wanted ice, in the words of someone present at a meeting with him, “to pull children out of school.” Career officials at the Department of Homeland Security opposed Miller’s plans, but Trump has since vowed to rid the government of such people in a second term. Enforcement would be indiscriminate and unpredictable, turning anyone who is undocumented into a potential target.', 'VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER', ' ', 'In the final years of the Obama Presidency, immigration authorities developed a policing strategy designed to spare from arrest millions of undocumented immigrants who hadn’t been convicted of crimes. When Trump took office, in 2017, he immediately ended that approach. The primary reason that there weren’t more deportations was the considerable resistance of local and state officials to coöperate with ice. Joe Biden revived the Obama-era strategy. But, if Trump gets back into the White House, it’s reasonable to expect that he will launch raids in Democratic cities and penalize recalcitrant jurisdictions by cutting off federal funds.', 'Of all the repugnant statements that Trump and his allies have made, the most revealing may have come from Vance. At a campaign event in North Carolina, he explained why he kept referring to Haitians in Springfield as “illegal” when, in fact, they are here legally, as a result of two federal policies that have been upheld in court, despite Republican efforts to dismantle them. “If Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I’m still going to call them an illegal alien,” Vance said. “An illegal action from Kamala Harris does not make an alien legal.”', 'By that logic, existing legal protections and court judgments would be moot. After the Trump Administration separated some five thousand children from their parents at the border, in 2017 and 2018, a federal judge ordered the government to reunite them, and forbade further separations for the next eight years as part of a federal settlement signed in December. If reëlected, will Trump simply ignore that? Hundreds of parents who were reunited with their children under the court order, but still lack permanent status, might well be deported.', 'They’re just one group among many that are especially vulnerable. Since Biden has been in office, the federal government has allowed more than a million people fleeing persecution and extreme hardship to enter the country legally, under an executive power known as parole, including seventy-seven thousand Afghans and more than five hundred thousand Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans. Trump has already said that he’d revoke their status and that they should “get ready to leave.” There are nearly a million other people who have Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to work legally while renewing their papers every eighteen months; a large share of them have lived in the U.S. for more than two decades. Several hundred thousand immigrants who came here as children also have a provisional legal status: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or daca.', 'What all these individuals have in common is that they willingly shared information with the U.S. government. Because of the deadlock in Congress, there’s nothing they can do to gain permanent status, so, when Obama and Biden created a legal opportunity, they took it. The outcome of the election may now determine whether such trust in the Presidency was misplaced. ♦', 'In order to function properly, Democracy needs the loser.', 'What happens to all the stuff we return?', 'When the piano world got played.', 'The Vogue model who became a war photographer.', 'The age of Instagram face.', 'Shouts & Murmurs: Ayn Rand reviews children’s movies.', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2024 Condé Nast.

And Trump has demonized minority groups and used increasingly dark, graphic imagery to talk about migrants in every one of his speeches since the Sept. 10 presidential debate, according to a POLITICO review of more than 20 campaign events. It’s a stark escalation over the last month of what some experts in political rhetoric, fascism, and immigration say is a strong echo of authoritarians and Nazi ideology.', '“He’s been taking Americans and his followers on a journey since really 2015 conditioning them … step by step instilling hatred in a group, and then escalating,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University who writes about authoritarianism and fascism and has been outspoken about the dangers of a second Trump administration.', '“So immigrants are crime.

The vice president has vowed to go even further than the Biden administration’s crackdown on asylum.', 'As the political conversation around immigration has shifted, Trump has not only intensified his rhetoric, but his policy plans.', 'He has increasingly targeted specific communities, including Springfield, Ohio, Charleroi, Pennsylvania and Aurora, arguing that immigrants are destroying American towns and cities across the country and using those examples to call for large-scale federal response.
