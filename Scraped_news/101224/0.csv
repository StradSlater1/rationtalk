The National Hurricane Center said in an early morning update that the storm is expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast tonight. Sustained winds reached 160 miles an hour overnight. The Hurricane Center is warning about dangerous storm surge conditions in particular, and that they bring an extremely life-threatening situation for the state's western coast.

We still don't know exactly what strength it will be when it hits and makes landfall, but really how are people preparing? What are you seeing there?"", 'Trevor Hughes:', ""Well, there are large portions of this area... I'm in Tampa, in St. Petersburg right now. There are large portions of this area that are under mandatory evacuations and a lot of people have left. The people who are staying are boarding up their windows. They're sandbagging as you might expect, but everyone frankly is exhausted from Helene and now Milton's coming."", 'Taylor Wilson:', 'Yeah, there are still people displaced from that storm. You mentioned Helene. Where are they going? How is this influencing them?', 'Trevor Hughes:', ""It's been a real challenge. I spoke with someone earlier who lost his house in Helene. He had two feet of floodwater destroy his house, destroyed his cars, essentially his savings, and he's been living in his car ever since. So when I talked to him, he was at an emergency shelter trying to find a place to rest with his parrot because it's been a real crisis."", ""People can't live in their houses and they don't have anywhere to go right now. So hotels are all booked up, people are staying with friends and family, and then there's quite a lot of shelters that are open and folks are really starting to flood into those."", 'Taylor Wilson:', ""And Trevor, you're really no stranger to storms. You've covered these for years. What are you most worried about with Hurricane Milton?"", 'Trevor Hughes:', ""I think there's a couple of things going on. The storm surge may be significantly larger for this area than it was for Helene, and we're talking about a city, Tampa and St. Petersburg, where there are piles of debris still all over the place from a storm a couple of weeks ago. So there's a real concern that this will actually be much worse in terms of storm surge."", 'But the other factor is the mental health. I mean, people here are exhausted, dealing with storm after storm, and you get the sense that there\'s just this, ""oh my goodness, what is going to happen next"" kind of feeling that\'s going on.

But a report yesterday from a Senate Democrat found the investigation flawed and incomplete without following up on multiple leads. A report from a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, criticized the FBI for not investigating more fully claims of Kavanaugh's alleged sexual misconduct described by two women. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Whitehouse's report said the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips it received, but passed them along to the White House. Kavanaugh did not respond to a request for comment and Trump campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that the ridiculous story about the report was a way to delegitimize the Supreme Court and pave the way for Kamala Harris to pack the court with radical-left judges."", '♦', 'Even as spiking grocery bills and car prices have cooled, health insurance rates are climbing. The average cost for a family health insurance plan offered through an employer, increased 7% this year to $25,572 according to the annual Employer Health Benefit Survey released today by KFF, a non-profit health policy organization. The cost of family health insurance jumped 7% for the second consecutive year, after a decade of more modest yearly increases. Family insurance rates increased by just 1% in 2022. As for individuals, insurance costs bumped up 6% to just under $9,000 this year, according to the survey. A year ago, individual plans increased 7%. Health insurance costs have risen at higher rates than the increase in workers\' wages. Health insurance rates accelerating after a decade of more modest increases likely reflects the growth of prices in the economy overall according to Matthew Ray, Associate Director of KFF\'s Health Care Marketplace Project.

The lawsuits were filed separately in New York, California, D.C and 11 other states and expand Chinese-owned TikTok\'s legal fight with US regulators while seeking new financial penalties against the company. The states accused TikTok of using intentionally addictive software, designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness. The states say TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in order to target them with ads. And New York Attorney General, Letitia James, said ""young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok"", in her words. TikTok said last week, ""it strongly disagrees with allegations that it fails to protect children"", saying that ""it has robust safeguards in place for teens and parents"".

I spoke with USA TODAY, Congress Campaigns and Democracy reporter, Karissa Waddick, for more.', 'Karissa, thank you so much for hopping back on the show.', 'Karissa Waddick:', 'Yeah, absolutely.', 'Taylor Wilson:', ""So Karissa, just starting here, how are some comedians finding really an audience with conservatives and who are some of the folks we're talking about here?"", 'Karissa Waddick:', ""We're thinking about Joe Rogan, Greg Gutfeld, who hosts a show on Fox News. He's one of the most popular late-night show hosts out there right now. And other podcasters too, like Theo Von. So that's the group we're thinking about. And their popularity has skyrocketed in the last four or so years as a lot of the mainstream comedians on TV, thinking like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, people like that, have leaned towards a more liberal leaning audience. There's been a gap for conservative leaning listeners and experts I spoke with said that these comedians, their comedy might not inherently be political all the time, but they've leaned into some of the more anti-woke and conservative stances that relate to conservative viewers."", 'Taylor Wilson:', 'So Karissa, how are Donald Trump and the GOP really approaching this movement and are they leaning in and trying to build their base this way?', 'Karissa Waddick:', ""Yeah, so Donald Trump is definitely paying attention to this movement. Trump has appeared on Gutfeld. He appeared in mid-September on the show and it was his first late-night show appearance since 2016. He's also been on Theo Von and has said that he's interested in appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast, though he hasn't appeared on that one."", ""So Trump and his allies understand the importance of this audience and they want to reach those listeners. They have been trying to gain more support with men and their base, and these platforms have a heavy audience of men, and so it's really important for them to reach those listeners."", 'Taylor Wilson:', ""Karissa, how is the growth of conservative comedy, this movement that we're talking about, really mirrored some of what we've previously seen on the left?"", 'Karissa Waddick:', ""So when you think about left-leaning comedy, one of the people that comes to mind is John Stewart. In the early two thousands, he became popular during the George W. Bush administration. He said the same thing as a lot of the conservative-leaning comedians do now, which is that their comedy isn't expressly ideological."", 'Stewart acknowledged that he had liberal biases, but he said that his goal was to make people laugh. But at the end of the day, his audience leaned more liberal and a lot of his comedy leaned into liberal viewpoints and many of the alumni of his show, we think of Stephen Colbert, we think of John Oliver. People like that have come to define comedy now and our major comedic figures who a lot of people listen to. And so the movement now of conservative-leaning comedy gaining viewership is similar.', 'Taylor Wilson:', ""And in terms of the tangible impact on this year and this year's election, what impact is all this having on the 2024 race?"", 'Karissa Waddick:', ""We all know too well that this race is going to be tight and every vote really counts. It'll be decided on hundreds of thousands of votes in a handful of states. And the two candidates are doing everything they can to reach voters where they are. Like I said, Trump is really focused on building his base with male support. These audiences are key to that. So reaching the viewers that these people have is important for them to cultivate that."", 'Taylor Wilson:', 'Karissa Waddick covers Congress, Campaigns and Democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Karissa.', 'Karissa Waddick:', 'Thanks so much.', '♦', 'Taylor Wilson:', 'How do perspectives on sex, money, climate change and politics divide generations in the US?

The storm moved from west to east—the opposite of most hurricanes, which travel from east to west with the trade winds—making it the only hurricane to directly hit Tampa Bay in almost 100 years. Milton brought with it hurricane-force winds that spawned at least 19 tornadoes across the state and its storm surge caused water levels to rise up to 9 feet in some areas. The roof was ripped off Tropicana Field, home to the Tampa Bay Rays and a large crane collapsed and smashed into the side of a building in downtown St. Petersburg. Milton hit Florida two weeks after Hurricane Helene made landfall in the state’s Big Bend region as a massive Category 4 storm.

Should people continue to live and enjoy life here? Absolutely. But we need to be smart, so that we build resilient communities.”', 'Asked Friday whether Floridians should be prevented from rebuilding in low-lying areas, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said no.', '“The reality is people work hard to be able to live in environments that are really, really nice, and they have a right to make those decisions with their property as they see fit,” DeSantis said at a news conference in St. Petersburg. “It is not the role of government to forbid them or to force them to dispose or utilize their property in a way that they do not think is best for them.”', 'DeSantis said it was tough for residents to face back-to-back storms but Floridians had a lot of resilience. After Hurricane Ian hit Florida in 2022, he said, a lot of people asked: “Are people going to want to live in southwest Florida?”', '“Within two weeks, you had people buying up homes, people wanted to get down there.” DeSantis said. “So I think that there’s always going to be a demand to live in a beautiful part of the world.”', 'Many on Florida’s west coast were relieved that Milton weakened to a Category 3 hurricane before it made landfall and did not bring record storm surge that would have wiped out their homes. But they were left shaken by the familiar routine of evacuation and cleanup, loss of power and gas.', 'After surveying the impacts of Milton in Manatee County in a helicopter, U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) said it was “truly devastating to see homes in such disrepair, knocked on their sides, roofs ripped off and sand and debris everywhere.”', '“A lot of homes kind of almost rolled into the water,” Buchanan said. “I’ve never seen it before, I’ve lived on the water for 30 years.”', 'More than 2 million Florida customers remained without power Friday afternoon, according to Poweroutage.us, which tracks national power outages.

He had lived there for almost a quarter of a century.', 'Milton crashed an oak tree into his spare bedroom window. But the damage was not as severe as last month, when water from Helene rose above the one-story home’s windowsill, or even as great as last year, when Hurricane Idalia flooded his home in 6 inches of water. Over the last week, he has sparred with his insurance company because the white cabinets lost in Helene were the same color as the ones he lost in Idalia. They asked whether he’d had them replaced at all.', 'Rosseter, 68, thought his home was worth saving — even if all the doors, drywall and lower kitchen cabinets needed to be replaced.', '“You can’t sell it like this,” he said matter of factly as he cleaned a table in his carport to make a staging area for his repairs. “It’s just another renovation. I’m not going to make an emotional decision based on this hurricane season.”', 'For now, Rosseter is sleeping on his sister’s couch as he waits to hear whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency will give him a camper he can put in his driveway as he makes repairs.', 'The $750 provided by FEMA, he said, was enough to put gas in the car and keep him fed. But he could not hire contractors until insurance money or other assistance comes in.', 'On the northern end of Longboat Key, Lynn and Steve Roberts were in good spirits as they walked around their two disaster-stricken investment townhomes, stepping around broken glass from one of their neighbor’s back windows.', 'A few weeks ago, Helene flooded the units with 8 inches of storm surge. Milton didn’t bring more flooding, but it tore the roof off, leaving a piece dangling several dozen feet above in a nearby pine tree.', '“It’s dry when it’s not raining,” Steve, a 65-year-old emergency room doctor, joked.', '“Think we were due,” Lynn said, noting they had never filed an insurance claim in 25 years living in hurricane-prone South Carolina, the Florida Panhandle and now south Florida.', 'The couple purchased the two units in the last year to rent as Airbnbs.', 'Lynn, trying to stay busy and productive, pulled things from the upper cabinets to take back home, since those would have to be ripped out after losing the roof. An insurance adjuster would come out in three days, on her birthday. “It’s my birthday present,” she said, laughing.', 'The couple said it was a shame to lose so much of the property, but they weren’t giving up on it.', '“We bought it ‘cause of this,” she said, pointing to the serene lagoon at the back of the property. “We love to be on the water, and it’s worth it to us to stay here. We’re not going anywhere.”', 'Both said they felt grateful to have another place to lay their heads at night, but knew others had felt the brunt of both storms. “For us, it’s an inconvenience,” she said. “For others, it was their livelihoods.”', 'There is still potential for additional storms before hurricane season is over at the end of November.', 'Matthew Rosencrans, the lead for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s seasonal hurricane outlook, said it is too early to tell if those storms will make landfall and, if so, where the greatest effects will be.', '“We are looking at relatively enhanced odds of tropical cyclone formations in the western Caribbean, south of Cuba,” Rosencrans said. “Storms there do tend to kind of move towards the Gulf of Mexico, although they can be swept directly from southwest to northeast.”', 'Times staff writer Hannah Fry contributed to this report.', 'Oct. 10, 2024', 'Oct. 10, 2024', 'Oct. 10, 2024', 'Sign up for Essential California', 'The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', '', 'Jenny Jarvie is a national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times based in Atlanta.', '', 'Sandra McDonald is an intern with the Fast Break Desk, the Los Angeles Times’ breaking news team.

My Relatives Live in the Path of Hurricane Milton.

It’s a culture I’ve experienced firsthand.', 'By River Page', 'October 8, 2024', '', 'As Hurricane Milton barrels toward central Florida, thousands are struggling to leave before its expected landfall Wednesday afternoon. But thousands more will not, despite evacuation orders across eight counties in the Tampa Bay area. That includes Pasco County, where my in-laws live—their house is slightly out of the mandatory evacuation zone, but given its proximity to the coastline and the path of the storm, it is far from a great place to be at this time. Despite invitations for them to stay with my husband and I in Pensacola—which is in the Panhandle and safely out of the cone—they say they aren’t going anywhere. ', '“I’ve lived here [in Florida] my whole life,” my mother-in-law, Melissa Farley, a 57-year-old surgery center administrator from Dade City, Florida, tells me. She and my father-in-law, Chris, don’t want to leave the three-bedroom brick house they inherited from Chris’s grandmother over a decade ago. She says that she’s seen around nine or 10 hurricanes in her lifetime. “We have never evacuated. We used to protect our windows with masking tape. We have hurricane-grade windows now, a block home, and a generator if we lose power. I think I don’t evacuate because I never have. This one is definitely scary and I thought about it this time, but ultimately I feel safe at our house.” ', 'For my father-in-law Chris, the reasons are slightly different. He’s worried about leaving his elderly dad, and also was worried about looters breaking into his house and stealing things. As a wildland firefighter, he also feels an obligation to stick around and help those who need it. “If it’s my time to go, it’s my time to go. At least I’ll be in my house where I belong.” ', 'Melissa was right to at least think about leaving. Milton is expected to be intense, with forecasters predicting 15-foot-high storm surges and over eight inches of rain across the Tampa Bay area, where over three million people live. Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, actually told those in mandatory evacuation areas that, “If you choose to stay. . . you are going to die.”', 'It’s not just the stubborn who stay. Many people can’t leave. For a variety of logistical reasons, it’s nearly impossible to evacuate a major metropolitan area like Tampa in a matter of days.  With just two highways going north out of the state, traffic jams are common—and no one wants to be caught in a hurricane in a car. Poor people, lacking vehicles or the money for hotels, often can’t manage it. (See: New Orleans and Katrina.)', 'Plus, hurricane paths are hard to predict and Floridians are used to being told that a storm is bearing down on them only for it to veer elsewhere. Some people are gamblers.', 'But in the Sunshine State, there’s also something of a culture around non-evacuation—one I’ve experienced firsthand. I didn’t evacuate when Hurricane Sally barreled toward my home in Pensacola in 2020, and nobody else I knew—not old college classmates, not co-workers, not friends—did either. As the storm raged and I waded through ankle-deep water in my apartment, assessing the damage and with nowhere else to go, I could hear a crowd of neighbors playing country music upstairs. After the winds subsided and I started to sweep the water out the front door, one of them popped down to offer my husband and me a beer. Like many others in the city, they were having a hurricane party—a phenomenon, exactly what it sounds like, that is so widespread in the Southeast, particularly in Florida, that it has its own Wikipedia page.', 'But now things are changing. One of my husband’s aunts, Michelle Wells, who lives in Palm Harbor—a small community north of St. Petersburg, which is projected to be dead in the eye of this week’s storm—is staying with my in-laws because their house is further inland than hers. Another aunt, Patti Beck, who has lived in Pinellas County her entire life, says that she is evacuating for the first time. She tells me locals have long believed a local myth that says a local Indian tribe cast a protective spell over the area a thousand years ago, keeping the Tampa Bay area safe from a hurricane’s direct hit. But the devastation of Hurricane Helene, which killed over 230 people late last month, scared her. ', '“Helene scared the hell out of me. Although we were unaffected, this storm surge is supposed to be twice as high. Denis Phillips is our local weatherman that we stalk like he is a rock star. He said go. A respected expert, recent experience, and fear of what new weather patterns are bringing prompts us to pull the trigger for the first time.”', 'Why do people stay? I asked Dallas Nelson, a dispatcher from Milton, Florida, a small community near Pensacola that has seen its fair share of hurricanes, including the one that flooded my apartment in 2020. Last month, Helene completely destroyed his mother’s house in Perry, Florida—a town in the Big Bend area that’s also in Milton’s path—leaving only the frame behind. Before the storm hit last week, he convinced her to evacuate, likely saving her life, but said it was “a lot of work.” ', '“There’s three types of people who stay: One, those who can’t leave. Two, people who have never experienced a climate change event, so they have no context for how dangerous they are. Three, people who have experienced a disaster but it wasn’t that bad. You try telling someone whose house is 30-plus years old that it won’t be there tomorrow morning and they’ll laugh at you.” ', 'He adds, “The worst part about being lucky is never understanding how lucky you are.”', 'River Page is a reporter for The Free Press.

I understand you're at your city's emergency operations center. Just tell us where you are right now and what's ahead."", 'Ken Welch:', ""Well, now we're playing a waiting game. We're tracking the storm as it comes toward us. We have locked down the city, evacuated folks."", ""We have got thousands of folks in our emergency shelters and many more have left the city or the county, which is exactly what we asked them to do to move out of the threat of the storm surge. And so now we're waiting to see which way the storm actually tracks."", ""As you know, a storm of this size, 20 or 30 miles' difference can make all the difference in the world in terms of the impact of storm surge. But we know we're going to be impacted by the broad wind field from this hurricane. And we're bracing for that and ready to get into recovery tomorrow."", 'Amna Nawaz:', ""There's some predictions that say the storm surge, if it comes on a certain path, could be as high as 15 feet, which is just really impossible to imagine. In a city like St. Petersburg, what would that do? What does that look like?"", 'Ken Welch:', 'Well, there are areas where it would not be survivable. We saw from Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago what that impact would be.', ""That was a record-breaking storm for us in terms of storm surge at six to seven feet. We have never seen it that high. And, as you said, Hurricane Milton has a potential to more than double that. And so I think that really got the attention of folks that live in those low-lying areas, and we evacuated areas A, B and C, and those folks have, again, moved out of harm's way, which is a good thing."", ""So, as long as folks are responsive to what we asked them to do in terms of moving away from that storm surge, not one life has to be lost from that. And that's the most important thing. The impacts of the wind is inevitable, and we have to rebuild from that. But saving lives is the most important thing right now."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Do you think Hurricane Helene having come through in some ways made it more real for people, made more people heed the mandatory evacuation who might not have otherwise?', 'Ken Welch:', 'No doubt in my mind.', 'I have talked to folks who said they have never seen water in their neighborhoods before. And that really convinced them that they needed to move this time. And we have seen entire neighborhoods that are in those low-lying areas where no one is there now. They have actually heeded the call. No, I know it made a big difference.', 'Amna Nawaz:', ""We know there are always people who still don't want to evacuate, other people who simply cannot evacuate. do you know how many people are left in St. Petersburg and what's your message to them now?"", 'Ken Welch:', 'Well, we started very early in this process, and this is a routine for us.', ""We have special needs. We have transportation, door-to-door transportation for folks who need it who sign up on a special needs registry, that we were still taking names as late as yesterday for that. And so our message is, there's no reason to stay in an unsafe place. We have got shelter space. We have transportation to get you there."", 'And folks have been very responsive to that, really good utilization of our shelters at this point.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'But, Mr. Mayor, if I may, do you have any idea how many people may have stayed, how many people are still there?', 'Ken Welch:', 'I do not.', ""The estimate for our county was half-a-million people. About half of the population were in the evac zone and asked to leave. Our city, we think it's roughly the same thing, so, 135,000, 140,000 people asked to leave. And from what we have seen, what we have heard from our folks who've been out in those neighborhoods, they have been responsive."", 'For the ones who are left, our message is at a certain point, when we get 50-mile-an-hour sustained winds, there will not be emergency response. We will not be putting our first responders in danger at that point and help will not be available.', 'Amna Nawaz:', ""There's also been a number of reports about construction cranes in downtown St. Petersburg, some as high as 600-feet-tall, that weren't dismantled before the storm. I think a lot of folks are wondering why not."", 'And also, if people are in the vicinity of those cranes, are they at risk?', 'Ken Welch:', 'So, we have done active outreach to make sure folks are aware of that issue.', ""And, again, this is a matter of the storm developing so quickly. It was a tropical storm just a few days ago, became a powerful Cat 5 in 24 hours. It takes seven days to take these cranes down. So it's just not possible within the time span of the development of this hurricane to take those down."", ""And so it's a lesson learned about how we go forward what we require in terms of the strength of those cranes, if they can't be taken down quickly enough to deal with a storm like this."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Mr. Mayor, are storms like this the new normal for St. Petersburg and other areas around there?', 'Ken Welch:', 'Look, we believe in sea level rising, extreme weather and those changes.', 'We have developed a Tampa Bay compact of local governments who have changed our investments, our infrastructure approach for years to come. But the pace of the change is much quicker than even we thought would happen. And so we need to readdress the pace of our infrastructure improvements and how we deal with adapting to this new normal.', 'It certainly is a new normal. These two record-breaking storms within two weeks of each other is evidence of that.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'That is Mayor Ken Welch of St. Petersburg, Florida.', ""Mr. Mayor, please stay safe.

The Relentlessness of Florida Hurricane Season,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-relentlessness-of-florida-hurricane-season,"['', '', 'John Morales, a veteran meteorologist in South Florida, hadn’t slept much. The N.F.L.’s “Sunday Night Football” game on October 6th, between the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers, was delayed owing to lightning, and ran late, so he didn’t go on air with his forecast until 1 a.m. He was tracking a Category 1 hurricane that had formed in the western Gulf of Mexico the previous day, and calmly reported its projected track. He then slept for about four hours. As he prepared to go on air again, at noon, he received an urgent bulletin from the National Hurricane Center. The storm was now a Category 5.', 'When the broadcast began, he wasn’t facing the camera because he was still analyzing the data. When he glanced up, he looked stricken. “Just an incredible, incredible, incredible hurricane,” he said. “It has dropped fifty millibars in ten hours.” He paused, clearly trying to collect himself. To Morales, a barometric pressure drop that fast meant an extreme, record-breaking intensification of the hurricane; it had turned into a monster. Morales was suddenly overcome, on the verge of tears. His voice quivering, he continued, “I apologize. This is just horrific.”', 'If you haven’t heard of Morales, then it’s likely that you missed the Hurricane Milton coverage entirely. His broadcast, which he hesitantly posted on X, went viral, and has now been seen nearly two million times. Morales became the unlikely center of a media blitz, appearing on the front page of newspapers, and on prime-time television news all over the world. Known to South Floridians as a calm, comforting presence onscreen, Morales had been connecting extreme weather to climate change for two decades, but he had always maintained a neutral, restrained style. All that went out the window with Milton. It may have been unplanned, but, by letting his emotions show, he became America’s weatherman.', 'Floridians are accustomed to hurricanes, weary of storms to the point that many are relatively nonchalant about a big storm’s approach. Some even ignore mandatory evacuation orders. But the Morales clip got people’s attention. Some evacuees told interviewers, or commented online, that Morales was the reason they had decided to leave. For everyone else, the mayor of Tampa, Jane Castor, delivered a stern warning on Monday evening. “Helene was a wake-up call,” she said. “This is literally catastrophic, and I can say, without any dramatization whatsoever, if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you’re gonna die.”', 'In south Tampa, retired Army Colonel Norm Allen was in the process of updating his will. He designated beneficiaries for various accounts. On Wednesday, he put the will in a plastic bag and wrapped it with yarn—an idea his brother gave him—so it wouldn’t appear to be trash. “If things don’t work out, I want somebody to find it,” he told me. Allen, who is sixty-five, had decided to ride out the storm in his house, a one-story bungalow in the Palma Ceia neighborhood, with green-and-white-striped awnings over the front windows, and a large American flag waving above the front steps. Allen’s house is eighteen feet above sea level. He was not concerned about storm surge, but he was wary of the rain and wind. “My big fear is the trees,” he said. His yard didn’t have any, but all of his neighbors’ did. “I’ve had plenty of people question my judgment here,” he said. “But I’m an Army guy. I’ve been around the world, on a number of battlefields, in places where rounds and rockets are coming in on us. I’ve flown through dangerous areas in military aircraft.”', 'He and his dog Rhett, an eight-year-old English setter, were going to shelter in a narrow interior hallway, where he had placed a little sleeping pallet covered in quilts. “That ought to be safe, except for that big tree outside,” he said. The hurricane’s landfall was four hours away. He sounded calm, almost cheerful. If that tree came down, it could break through the roof over the hallway where he would be sheltering. “So I’m prepared to pull out a mattress and put it over me,” he said. He had also moved his tools, his chainsaw, his axe, inside the house. He had filled the bathtub with water (the county had shut off the water earlier), froze more water and put it in a cooler, and sedated Rhett. He was trying to avoid checking the news too often. “You also make sure you have a little bourbon or something,” he said. He would keep his yarn-wrapped will nearby. “You have to be smart, right?” he said. “I’m a little older now, and I’ve lived a full life.”', 'Allen’s home was about a block away from a mandatory evacuation zone. His neighborhood, usually full of families and kids, was desolate. When we spoke, he had just returned from checking on his neighbors’ houses. Many of them have koi ponds that he helps maintain. After he got off the phone, he heated up a chicken pot pie, his favorite meal. He figured he might not have hot food again for a while.', 'Allen’s house hadn’t sustained any damage during Hurricane Helene, just ten days earlier. But tens of thousands of houses and vehicles in the area had been damaged, or destroyed, by a five-foot salt-water flood that had washed over barrier islands and low-lying city neighborhoods. So, as Milton approached, far more people evacuated, heeding official orders and pleas. Stewart Macdonald and his wife, Laurie, did not. They live on St. Pete Beach, one of Tampa Bay’s barrier islands, all of which were under mandatory evacuation orders. “If the kids were here,” Macdonald, a financial adviser, told me, “we would have left.” But their kids were in Tallahassee, where they both attend Florida State University. So Macdonald, who had grown up in Florida and was accustomed to hurricanes—as a teen-ager, he said, a hurricane meant bringing a cooler of beer to the beach to party—and who had never evacuated for a hurricane before, decided to stay.', 'VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER', 'Denial', 'Their house made the decision easier. They had moved there in 2000, not long after it was built, by a ninety-year-old former concert pianist. She had specific acoustic and accessibility requirements, so the design was unusually sturdy: three stories, built from concrete, with a concrete-tile roof. The first floor was twelve feet above sea level, and the house had a concrete elevator shaft. In a worst-case scenario, the Macdonalds would shelter in the elevator. “I’m fully expecting to get an object flying through one of our windows,” Macdonald told me. Among the biggest threats were the ubiquitous piles of Helene wreckage. Some of the piles were twenty-five feet high. Mattresses, couches, tables, golf clubs, washing machines, long shards of wood and drywall—the piles still lined the streets. Projectiles in waiting.', 'The precise location of Hurricane Milton’s landfall remained uncertain nearly until its eyewall hit the central Gulf Coast, sometime after 6 p.m. By that point, severe, unexpected tornadoes—the kind usually seen in Kansas and Texas, and another example of the new abnormal conditions of our planet’s climate—had already devastated southern parts of the state. Fortunately, for Tampa, a city of more than three million people, the storm, which had been moving northeast, had veered right, with the eye passing over Sarasota just after 8 p.m. Farther south, Naples and Fort Myers, which were hammered by Hurricane Ian, in 2022, saw waters rise by five to six feet. “Because many areas hardest hit by storm surge are still inaccessible, the full magnitude of Milton’s impact has yet to be revealed,” Morales texted the next morning.', 'Still, Tampa and St. Petersburg experienced extreme amounts of rainfall and wind speeds above a hundred miles per hour. Five inches of rain fell between 8 and 9 p.m. in St. Petersburg, which meteorologists said was a once-in-a-thousand-year rain event. More than nine inches fell over three hours. Over all, the city received more than eighteen inches. The National Weather Service issued flash-flood emergency warnings for the city, as well as for Tampa, Riverview, and Palmetto.', 'The roof of Tropicana Field, in St. Petersburg, home to the Tampa Bay Rays, flew off around 11 p.m. The stadium was filled with rows of cots, meant to accommodate more than ten thousand first responders and debris-cleanup workers. Around the same time, a construction crane fell on an office building in St. Petersburg that contains the offices of the Tampa Bay Times. The crane had tumbled from a skyscraper that will eventually be the tallest residential building on Florida’s Gulf Coast.', 'As the eye passed over Sarasota, providing a brief, eerie stillness on the ground—birds singing, crickets chirping—the wind and rain in Tampa, on the north side of the storm, grew violent. Allen had water rising on the side of his house, so he went outside and dug a drainage trench in the torrential rain, breaking two shovels in the process. Big oak trees were swaying hard. Back inside, he still had power, so he threw his clothes in the dryer, then texted me an update that concluded, “Just heard a loud thud . . . back in a bit.”', 'He soon wrote again: he couldn’t find the source of the crash, and it was now too dangerous to go outside. “Rhett not quite sure what is going on, but clings closer,” he texted. The winds grew stronger, and “sounded like a freight train,” he wrote, the rain “was like a wall,” and lightning started flashing. “It sounds like a continuous huffing and puffing, rolling across the house,” he texted. The power finally went out. (By the next morning, more than three million Floridians had no power.) Just before midnight, with the rain letting up, Allen was able to open a window to get some fresh air—a cause for celebration.', 'In St. Pete Beach, as the eye was passing onto land, the Macdonalds sipped the best tequila they had. They saw no storm surge, but the rain was relentless, “swirling up and sideways.” Water started coming in through the windows and the doors because of the ferocious wind, and they tried to sop it up with towels. By 10:30 p.m., the wind and the rain seemed only half as bad as they had earlier. The worst was over. “Would we do this again? Staying vs. leaving?” Macdonald wrote in a text. “I know this sounds crazy, but yes, we would stay.”', 'Morales worked late into the night at the station in Miami, tweeting when he could, and appearing on CNN just before Milton made landfall. By morning, there was catastrophic damage across Florida, but the consensus was that it could have been worse. The evacuation had been one of the largest in the state’s history. The area from Sarasota to Fort Myers and the barrier islands that line the region, seemed to have suffered the worst damage. Morales was most struck by the dozens of tornadoes (known as supercells) that the hurricane spawned in unexpected places, such as Palm Beach county, on Florida’s Atlantic coast. There were a hundred and twenty-six tornado warnings issued, a new record for Florida, and at least nineteen touched ground. They flipped cars, destroyed at least a hundred and fifty homes and structures, and were responsible for almost half of Milton’s twelve known fatalities.', 'Morales tried to retire in 2022, having achieved the distinction of longest-running broadcast meteorologist in South Florida. But his station, NBC 6, convinced him to stay on as a hurricane specialist. Now he only works hurricane season. “The problem is that the chances for rapid intensification have increased dramatically compared to the twentieth century,” he said. “That’s being empirically measured. We are indeed seeing a greater proportion of hurricanes reach Category 4 and 5 intensity.” He told me that he is committed to remaining non-alarmist, if the conditions warranted that, but the climate grief, the anxiety, was wearing on him. “Us meteorologists and climate scientists, especially, we feel a little crushed by all that’s going on, knowing that this was all coming.” ♦', 'In order to function properly, Democracy needs the loser.', 'What happens to all the stuff we return?', 'When the piano world got played.', 'The Vogue model who became a war photographer.', 'The age of Instagram face.', 'Shouts & Murmurs: Ayn Rand reviews children’s movies.', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2024 Condé Nast.

She argued it would be more of an inconvenience and too expensive.', 'She was right. Two days prior to the hurricane’s arrival, our highways turned into parking lots, filled with impatient, groaning drivers. It took many of them 12 hours just to leave the state (it usually only takes ~4). The return home proved even longer for many.', ""Unfortunately, there isn't much fun or comfort waiting for them here in Tampa."", ""For me, the worst part of the hurricane isn’t even the hurricane itself, it’s the days leading up to it. You're stuck in this vortex of not knowing, of waiting to see what will happen. You watch news outlets hype up a doomsday storm that threatens to wash us all into the sea. Friends and family are texting you constantly. I was ready to just get it over with, ready to roll the dice and see what fate had in store."", 'The wobble tracker had the storm hitting a little south of Sarasota, which is 45 minutes away.

I told Laura, “Let’s close these curtains and move away from them.”', 'The rain was perpetual. There was no audible thunder or visible lightning. Just powerful continuous wind and rain.', 'The mega gusts came in pulses initially. Then, the front of my house looked like a wind tunnel, with the wind going near horizontal, specks of rain turning into long bullets. I was in awe of the power. I briefly opened one of the doors, and then struggled to even close it.', 'I was immensely worried about my property taking damage. My home was repaired two years ago for structural flaws that led to water intrusion. A prior storm left my windows crying on the inside of the house. I decided to distract myself and went to my office, putting on my headphones, and playing some video games. The wind howled repeatedly through the night, whistling through cracks in windows and doorways.', 'The storm began for us around 3 PM. It peaked between 9 PM and 11 PM.

Over the course of two hours, the power cut off about four different times for several seconds, before coming back on. I was pumped when it flickered back on, shouting, “Yeah! We might keep our power, Laura!” Then, in one final gasp, the power cut off and the house became inky black. The heat worked its way in.', ""It was a long night and neither of us slept well.

I cast the thought from my mind.', 'We spoke for a bit more, all before parting ways, and I wished all the best for the woman. Her predicament, and the broader storm at large, reminded me of how small most of my problems actually were. My worries about small leaks, money, social dynamics, all pale when you consider how fleeting life can be. During the storm, 17 tornadoes also touched down, claiming several lives in the process. A friend who lives south of me lost everything due to flooding. He now joins the long and excruciating process of filing a claim with a greedy insurance company.', ""The danger hasn't passed. We are still dealing with loose power lines. There's water everywhere, some branches still falling down.

'Make a choice to save your life'"", 'The hits keep coming.', 'Less than two weeks after Helene, Milton will strike the peninsular Florida Gulf Coast.', 'Despite uncertainty about exactly how Milton plays out, there is high confidence that destructive surge is coming to Southwest Florida on Wednesday, with the potential for the worst surge in more than 100 years in the Tampa Bay area. Widespread wind and rain impacts are also coming to northeast, central, and south Florida.', 'As of 11 a.m. Sunday morning, Milton’s sustained winds are up to 65 mph, as determined by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter plane. This flight also found Milton’s minimum pressure to be about 10 millibars lower than expected, an ominous signal that the storm is coming together quickly.', 'Rapid intensification is likely in the next 48 hours, and as usual, we don’t know exactly how high that strengthening cycle will spin up maximum winds. Embedded in a low-shear, high-moisture environment and crossing record-warm Gulf waters still in the upper 80s, the NHC is predicting Milton to become a major hurricane by late Monday.', 'Time plus Gulf is, as always, a dangerous combination.', 'Milton is drifting east today and will continue moving a little south of due east through Tuesday, when it will pass just north of the Yucatan peninsula. That is a very unusual direction of movement for a strong Gulf hurricane, one reason there remain few if any apt historical comparisons to Milton.', 'Later on Tuesday and into Wednesday as Milton approaches Florida, it will accelerate east-northeast or northeast as it feels combined northward nudges from a U.S. East Coast trough and a ridge of high pressure over the Caribbean.', 'However, Milton will not hook north toward the Panhandle, as a west-to-east-oriented subtropical jet over the Southeastern U.S. will keep the hurricane hustling eastward midweek, even as it gains latitude crossing the southeastern Gulf.', 'Therefore, Milton is expected to make landfall somewhere between the Nature Coast and Marco Island, most likely on Wednesday.', 'Models are nudging a bit back to the south on Sunday after jogging north yesterday, and it is simply too early to pick a landfall point within this range.', 'The most recent NHC track is basically Sarasota to Melbourne, which really means that if you are in the Tampa Bay metro area, Bradenton, Sarasota, Venice, Cape Coral, Fort Myers, Naples, or anywhere in west-central and Southwest Florida, we do not know whether the center of Milton will pass north, south, or over you.', 'Focusing on the exact forecast track is the wrong way to look at a storm like Milton, because impacts are going to be widespread throughout the Florida peninsula no matter what.', 'At this range, the primary focus for residents of the peninsular Gulf Coast should be on Milton’s surge threat. There is high confidence that Milton will be a powerful major hurricane on Tuesday in the south central Gulf.', 'As Milton angles northeast towards Florida later on Tuesday into Wednesday, it’s likely going to encounter enough stronger vertical wind shear and dry air to cause its maximum sustained winds to plateau or potentially even decline a bit prior to landfall.', 'However, these potential fluctuations in maximum sustained winds before landfall do not translate in any way to diminished surge threat. Milton will be a ferocious storm over the southeastern Gulf, building up a life-threatening wall of water over days that will be inbound to the Florida Gulf Coast, no matter what wind-based category Milton is labeled with at landfall.', 'Official surge forecast ranges from the NHC will be out soon. In the meantime, if you’re in Southwest Florida, you need to know that destructive surge is likely to occur on Wednesday.', 'There are better and worse scenarios, but a wallop is coming, especially for whoever gets the southeastern eyewall.', 'Still, as we know from very recent experience, a hurricane passing well to Southwest Florida’s north or east results in dangerous surge. If you are in a coastal flood zone, prepare now to leave when your local emergency manager calls for an evacuation.', 'In the Tampa Bay region and west-central Florida, there is more uncertainty about whether or not life-threatening surge will occur, but the potential of what could happen is historically bad. As in Ian and Irma, if the center of the hurricane passes south and east of Tampa Bay, primarily offshore winds will mean limited or no surge.', 'However, if Milton were to pass near or north of Tampa Bay, primarily onshore winds could drive surge above Helene’s heights and into the 10’+ realm not seen in the area since 1848 and 1921.', 'The best thing I can say now is that Tampa Bay residents simply have to prepare for Milton as if the worst case will occur, and hope that it doesn’t. The probability of severe surge is high enough, and the consequences of not evacuating low-lying areas dire enough, that you just can’t afford to roll the dice on getting lucky again.', 'Again, west-central Florida sadly has very, very recent reference points for the consequences of not heeding local authorities.', 'If your flood zone is told to evacuate, get inland. Figure out what you’d do if the word comes down today.', 'Another major impact of Milton that is not sensitive to exactly how the forecast plays out is the heavy rain threat to the entire Florida peninsula, which starts now and continues through midweek.', 'I’ve been highlighting excessive rainfall risks to South and Central Florida as likely to begin this weekend no matter what, and right on cue, widespread storms are spreading over the peninsula today.', 'This rainfall is only indirectly associated with Milton, but precipitation will nevertheless tally anywhere from 2-5”+ south of a line from roughly Cedar Key to Jacksonville before the storm arrives, with the highest risks of early week flash flooding in South Florida.', 'With dry air potentially punching into Milton’s southern half on Wednesday as it makes landfall, the highest risks of excessive rainfall with the hurricane itself will most likely be in Central or Northeast Florida, even if landfall is farther south.', 'Once again, recent experience teaches us that we need to take the threat of hurricane-related flooding every bit as seriously as surge and wind, so be monitoring the situation closely in low-lying and freshwater flood-prone areas of the Orlando, Tampa, and even Jacksonville metro areas.', 'The northwestern cutoff of the heavy rain threat will fall across the Big Bend, and the central and western Panhandle should be mostly dry.', 'Coastal and inland wind impacts are also a potential major issue for Central and South Florida, albeit the one with the lowest forecast confidence at this point.', 'Due to interaction with a subtropical jet stream as it nears and crosses Florida, Milton’s top winds may be on the downswing just prior to landfall on Wednesday, though likely at the cost of smearing tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force wind gusts over a large area.', 'As highlighted by the NHC forecast discussion, the complicated jet dynamics in play may well result in a stronger “weak” (in this case, north/west) side of Milton than one might expect, even if the storm were to drop a category or two from its Category 3 or 4 peak intensity.', 'We really can’t put a fine point on potential wind impacts at specific locations yet, but residents of coastal areas from the Nature Coast south, plus the entire inland Florida peninsula should do what you can now to prepare your property for high winds, particularly in areas already brutalized just two weeks ago by Helene.', 'Bottom line is nothing good is going on with Milton today, and I continue to hate that this is happening so, so much. We’re facing a compounded threat with few precedents in hurricane history, as only 1926, 1950, 2004, and 2005 saw two Category 3 or higher landfalls in Florida.', 'Whether or not 2024 joins that list is immaterial to the near-certainty that Helene and Milton are likely to go down as one of the most devastating one-two statewide punches of all time.', 'We’re all exhausted already. You are, I am. That’s reality, and I know that.', 'Unfortunately, it’s also reality that we have to react, prepare, and if necessary, evacuate, because the surge, rain, and wind threat from Milton requires our last full measures to protect life and property.', 'I’ll be keeping you posted with updates through the storm, which too, shall pass. Keep watching the skies.', 'Dr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee company providing forensic meteorology expert witness services, and agricultural and hurricane forecasting subscription services.

The currents created by tides can also combine with the waves to severely erode beaches and coastal highways.', 'Six inches of fast-moving water is enough to knock over an adult, the National Hurricane Center says. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused storm surges of more than 25ft on the Mississippi coastline that killed as many as 1,500 people killed directly or indirectly.', 'Hurricane Milton was the second deadly hurricane in two weeks to hit the state of Florida, as hurricanes are becoming more intense and dangerous due to the climate crisis, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, experts say.', 'According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, sea level is predicted to rise between 29 and 82cm by the end of the century as a the sea continues to get warmer.', 'The research states that sea level rise will make storm surge flooding during hurricanes more devastating.', 'As greenhouse gases help trap heat in the atmosphere, they are also helping to supercharge the oceans with record-breaking temperatures.', 'In addition, hurricanes are getting more severe and intense as the heat in the Gulf of Mexico, where many of these storms develop, has been abnormally high. The extra heat acts as a sort of jet fuel for hurricanes, quickly turning them into major storms.', 'Researchers have found that since the 1970s, the number of storms escalating into category 4 or 5 hurricanes, with winds of at least 131mph (210km/h), has roughly doubled in the North Atlantic.', '“If you look back in time, historically, storms intensified at a slower rate than they do now,” said Phil Klotzbach, a researcher at Colorado State University who specialises in hurricane forecasting.']"
