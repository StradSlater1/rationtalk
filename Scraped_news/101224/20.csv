"Boeing to lay off 17,000 employees to 'stay competitive'",https://www.engadget.com/transportation/boeing-to-lay-off-17000-employees-to-stay-competitive-110033175.html,"['In a message to employees, Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg has announced that the company is reducing the size of its total workforce by 10 percent. That means Boeing is cutting roughly 17,000 jobs, including executives and managers, over the coming months. Ortberg, who only took the helm back in August, explained that the company has to ""make structural changes"" to ensure it can ""stay competitive"" and deliver for its customers over the long term.', ""Ortberg announced the upcoming layoffs in the midst of a machinist strike that had shut down production in most of Boeing's plants, including the ones manufacturing its best-selling plane, the 737 Max. Around 33,000 union machinists are involved in the strike, which has been going on since mid-September. As AP explains, that's had a big impact on Boeing's pockets, since it gets paid for half of what a plane costs after it delivers a customer's order."", 'In addition to the layoffs, Ortberg announced that Boeing will delay the development of its 777X planes due to the challenges it has faced in development, along with the ongoing work stoppage. It now plans to deliver the new wide-body planes in 2026 instead of 2025.', ""Boeing started 2024 having to ground some 737 Max 9 planes after an Alaska Airlines door plug blew off while it's mid-flight. While there were no reported injuries, the Boeing plane had only been in service since November last year. In July, the company had agreed to plead guilty to a conspiracy to defraud the US government following two fatal crashed in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. Boeing had also eaten hundreds of millions in losses as a result of Starliner's delayed return from the International Space Station. The company's first crewed flight was only supposed to last a few days, but hardware issues prevented it from sticking to the original timeline. In the end, the Starliner returned to Earth months later, without the astronauts it originally flew to the space station. Its crew will now come home on a SpaceX Dragon capsule in February next year.""]"

It also suffered massive losses in 2020 when the pandemic caused a near halt in air travel and forced airlines to pull back on their orders for new planes.', 'Among its more recent problems was a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines that blew off minutes into a January 5 flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.', 'While the plane was able to land without any serious injuries to passengers and crew, it sparked a new round of federal investigations into the safety and quality of Boeing’s planes. The preliminary findings of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory two months earlier without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.', 'Boeing’s space and defense business is also losing money. Its first crewed flight of the Starliner space craft left the two astronauts it carried stranded on the International Space Station for months, rather than the short visit they were supposed to make.', 'Ortberg on Friday said the company needs to “focus our resources … rather than spreading ourselves across too many efforts that can often result in underperformance and underinvestment.”', 'Boeing had already announced it was instituting rolling unpaid furloughs for a large share of its nonunion employees to try to save cash during the strike by members of the International Association of Machinists union (IAM). Those furloughs called for the affected employees to be off work one week out of every four. Friday marked the end of the fourth week of the strike.', 'The layoff decision means the next furlough cycle will not happen, Ortberg wrote Friday.

Boeing gets most of the money from the sale of a plane at the time of delivery.', 'Despite the dire financial conditions, Boeing had offered the IAM members raises of 25% over the four-year life of the proposed contract. But rank-and-file members of the union nearly unanimously rejected that offer and voted to go on strike starting September 13.', 'Boeing then raised its offer to increase wages by 30%, but the union leadership said that also was not sufficient. The union argues the company can afford its wage demands, despite its losses, pointing out wages to its members make up only a small fraction of an airplane’s overall costs. It blames the years of losses on mismanagement by the company.', 'Federally mediated talks between the two sides broke off earlier this week. Boeing said late Thursday that it filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board ahead of the layoff announcement, claiming the union is not negotiating in good faith, a charge the union denied after the job cuts plans were announced.', '“Bargaining is hard work, and Boeing keeps walking away from the table,” said Jon Holden, IAM president of District 751, which has most of the striking members. “The fact they are complaining about our proposals shows their desperation and only proves to our members that we are fighting for them. Our members will grow more defiant and more united as they see Boeing continually walk away and quit.”', 'But wages are not the only issue. Union members are still angry that Boeing demanded they give up their traditional pension plans 10 years ago, when the company was doing well financially.', 'The rank-and-file union members at that time narrowly agreed to the loss of the pensions because Boeing threatened to move jobs away from unionized plants in Washington state to new plants it might build elsewhere. Boeing dropped that threat in return for the loss of the pension plans.', 'Even with all of its problems, Boeing is likely at no risk of disappearing. The company has only one rival that also provides full-size passenger planes for the global airline industry: Airbus. However, Airbus does not have the capacity to handle Boeing’s orders. That’s because both Boeing and Airbus have order books for their planes stretching years into the future. If airlines that are Boeing customers cancel their order, they would have to wait five years for a comparable jet from Airbus.', 'Among the programs being cut is the 767 jet, which is now only being built in a freighter version. Boeing will discontinue that plane once its current orders are completed and delivered to customers in 2027. That plane is built by some of the union members now on strike.', 'The union issued a statement saying the announcement about the plans to discontinue the 767 “is very troubling, particularly given the current state of negotiations.” It said any decision on the 767 years in the future would have nothing to do with the current strike.', '“Boeing is attempting to bargain in the press. It won’t work and it is detrimental to the bargaining process,” said Holden. “They are attempting to deal directly with the membership and sow seeds of doubt and division in our union. They hope to drive a wedge within our union. There is no chance of that. We are stronger than ever and united on every picket line.”', 'Ortberg also said Boeing’s newest widebody passenger plane now being developed, the 777X, will be delayed further. The company had already disclosed it had been forced to halt test flights due to problems. “We have notified customers that we now expect first delivery in 2026,” he wrote.', 'This story has been updated with additional content.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

"Boeing’s Woes Mount, as Debt, Minimal Income, and a Hardening Strike Risk Bankrupting Company",https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/boeings-woes-mount-as-debt-minimal-income-and-a-hardening-strike-risk-bankrupting-company/90988651,"['Recognizing Trailblazing Female Entrepreneurs', 'Early-Rate Deadline: 11/1', 'Boeing announces layoffs and aircraft delays to cut costs, even as it continues racking up billions in losses from a month-long strike becoming more bitter each day.', 'BY BRUCE CRUMLEY @BRUCEC_INC', 'Boeing’s year of severe turbulence continued intensifying Sunday, as the strike by its 33,000 machinists advanced into its second month, while the aircraft maker struggles to surmount safety problems and reduced production. New estimates indicate just how quickly the costs of that lengthening conflict are rising for the company, as well as for its supply partners and airline customers.', 'According to a study by the Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, the strike that halted virtually all production of Boeing’s passenger jets has now cost the company nearly $5 billion. Reported by CNN Sunday, that estimate includes $3.7 billion in lost income and dividends to shareholders, but also $900 million to suppliers. Those include some 6,000 small businesses that make up about half of  Boeing’s 12,000-strong component and supply chain network.', 'Those figures don’t include myriad restaurants, retailers, and other businesses around shuttered Boeing factories in the Seattle area, which rely on patronage from company employees and those of its partners.', '“Suppliers, Seattle-area businesses, and Boeing customers are paying part of the price,” Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. “Our week-by-week estimates now include significantly larger losses to other businesses in the Seattle area, as well as losses to customers that rely on Boeing’s service and parts.”', 'FEATURED VIDEO', 'This Health Food Founder Would Rather Go Broad Than Niche', 'While those huge costs are worrying enough on their own, they’ve become scarier still by increasing so rapidly. Anderson’s earlier estimate over two weeks ago reported strike-related losses of just $1.05 billion to Boeing, and only $114 million to suppliers. While that study didn’t cite a figure for what the conflict had cost client airlines, the new one cited by CNN now puts that expense at $285 million to date.', 'The labor dispute has transformed what had before been a critical problem for Boeing into an increasingly dire existential threat.', 'Its troubles began last January when a side panel on one of its top-selling 737 MAX planes blew out at 16,000 feet. The incident led to a Federal Aviation Administration inspection that revealed systematic flaws in the company’s manufacturing safety procedures—one of which caused January’s mid-air drama.', 'A subsequent mandatory revamp of Boeing’s entire production system was accompanied by a cap on 737 MAX output, which has limited the company’s aircraft deliveries and income. That led to Boeing announcing first half losses of $33 billion in June, and a rising debt load to nearly $60 billion.', 'With even previous production under the 737 MAX cap now virtually halted by the strike, ratings agencies have warned they may move to cut the company’s credit rating to junk status. That could prevent many institutional investors like pension funds from holding its stock. The threat may have been one reason behind Boeing’s announcement Friday that it will cut 10 percent of its workforce—about 17,000 employees.', 'The surprise decision—even as it battles with the machinists’ union over its demands for a 40 percent increase in worker pay over the next four years—may have sought to placate the ratings agencies with appearances of restructuring. Yet as a hedge against a possible descent of its credit to junk status, the company is reportedly considering raising about $10 billion in capital through new stock issues before that demotion can occur.', 'That flurry of contrasting moves led some observers to view them as both haphazard and desperate.', '“It’s all getting a bit hand to mouth,” Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners LLP in London told Bloomberg. “It is not a coherent plan as such… as they reflect existing and developing problems and are not part of a restructuring.”', 'Outward signs that it’s trying to put its very troubled house in order also led Boeing to announce on Friday it was halting production of its 767 freighter aircraft, and will delay delivery of its 777 X passenger jet until 2026. Both moves create gaps for rival Airbus to fill, and further infuriate airlines that have been waiting for the 777 since its original 2020 delivery date.  ', 'Those included Emirates CEO Tim Clark, who was pointed in expressing his exhausted sympathy and patience for Boeing’s troubles.', '“Emirates has had to make significant and highly expensive amendments to our fleet program as a result of Boeing’s multiple contractual shortfalls and we will be having a serious conversation with them over the next couple of months,” Clark said, belittling Boeing’s new 2026 delivery promise for the 777—especially amid the ongoing strike.  “I fail to see how Boeing can make any meaningful forecasts of delivery dates.”', 'Other Boeing watchers have voiced surprise at the company taking such an emphatic hard line with striking workers, including withdrawing its counter-proposal last week to raise pay rates by 30 percent over four years.', 'Offering the full 40 percent the union demands would add around $1 billion in Boeing’s annual outlays, according to some estimates. But some observers point out that’s a modest cost increase compared to the urgency of resuming production and generating income to merely stay afloat.', '“It’s not a needle mover in terms of Boeing profitability,” Ken Herbert, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg of the added labor costs. “What are we waiting for here? Every day that goes by, it’s more disruptive and more of a cash drain.”', 'For now, however, Boeing continues holding firm, and continues negotiating like a strong company firmly installed in the driver’s seat—rather than a deeply indebted business losing billions every week from a strike that could potentially lead to bankruptcy.', 'The daily digest for entrepreneurs and business leaders', 'PRIVACY POLICY', 'NOTICE OF COLLECTION', 'AD VENDOR POLICY', 'TERMS OF USE', 'ADVERTISE', 'HELP CENTER', 'ABOUT US', 'SUBSCRIBE', 'SITEMAP', 'COPYRIGHT 2024 MANSUETO VENTURES', 'LEARN MORE']"

Boeing says it will continue producing 767-based KC-46 Pegasus military refuelling jets.', 'The backlog includes 29 767Fs, among them 12 on order with FedEx and 17 with UPS.', 'This year, prior to the strike, Boeing had been delivering about one 767F monthly, suggesting production of the freighter could be completed in a few years after the strike ends.', 'Boeing additionally on 11 October released preliminary financial results for its third quarter, saying it expects to lose $9.97 per share in the period – or about $6 billion. The company says it generated $17.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, down from $18.1 billion in the same period last year.', 'The third-quarter loss largely reflects $5 billion in charges across Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS).', 'The company will take a $2.6 billion third-quarter charge against its 777X programme, resulting from “an updated assessment of the certification timelines to address the delays in flight testing” and “anticipated delays associated with the IAM work stoppage”.', 'Boeing will take another $400 million charge in the period against the 767F programme due to the strike.', 'Ortberg says BDS will post “substantial new losses” for the third quarter, weighed down by a $700 million penalty charge against its KC-46.', 'That charge “reflects the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter and impacts of the IAM work stoppage”, Boeing says.', 'Starting in 2027, the company will produce 767-2C aircraft solely to support the KC-46A tanker programme. Boeing holds orders for 60 KC-46s, including four for Israel, two for Japan and the remaining 54 for the US Air Force, according to company’s data.', 'Boeing also continues to struggle on several of its most-important military development programmes, including the T-7A trainer jet and MQ-25 autonomous refueller.', 'BDS absorbed a $900 million penalty charge from the Pentagon on the T-7A in the third quarter, which the company says was driven by higher estimated costs on production contracts in 2026 and beyond.', 'The single-engined jet has been a consistent source of financial pain for Boeing, with just a handful of test examples delivered to the US Air Force well behind schedule.', 'Although the high-volume trainer programme is seen as a long-term source of stable revenue for BDS, the programme’s pre-pandemic fixed-price contract has made it a consistent loss-generator.', '', 'Source: US Air Force', 'Boeing is taking a $700 million third-quarter charge against its T-7A trainer, citing elevated costs', 'BDS will take a further $400 million third-quarter charge against development of the US Navy’s MQ-25 unmanned tanker jet and the Starliner commercial crew space capsule, which experienced multiple system malfunctions during its inaugural crewed flight in June.

Boeing’s Endless Doom Loop Gives No Respite to New CEO Ortberg,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/boeings-endless-doom-loop-gives-no-respite-to-new-ceo-ortberg-11728843632371.html,"['(Bloomberg) -- As Boeing Co. lurches from one crisis to the next, there’s been one constant for the embattled planemaker: Its predicament appears to be only getting worse.', 'From a freak accident that blew a door-size hole into the fuselage of an airborne 737 Max to revelations of sloppy workmanship and now a crippling strike entering its second month — the icon of US manufacturing hasn’t been able to catch a break since the first days of January. Cash is dwindling, plane production is anemic and the stock is heading for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis in 2008.', 'Combined, the episodes have exposed quality lapses at Boeing and its supply chain, alongside a corrosive culture a quarter-century in the making, where pressure over costs and schedule permeated decision-making. Earlier this year, customers finally revolted and the board shook up leadership, hiring Kelly Ortberg in August out of retirement to fix the beleaguered manufacturer. ', 'In his two months on the job, Ortberg has made a series of blunt moves. He removed the head of the defense and space division and tried to short-circuit a strike by taking a higher offer directly to workers — a move that backfired and only hardened the union’s resolve. ', 'Core Areas', 'His latest maneuver came late on Friday, when Ortberg said Boeing would cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to about 17,000 people. And he tucked in a hint that more dramatic steps might be needed to get the company back on course. ', '“We need to be clear-eyed about the work we face and realistic about the time it will take to achieve key milestones on the path to recovery,” the Boeing chief wrote in the Oct. 11 memo to workers. “We also need to focus our resources on performing and innovating in the areas that are core to who we are.”', 'The comments suggest that Boeing under Ortberg may double down on the field for which it is best known: Commercial aviation. The unceremonious departure of Ted Colbert as head of the defense and space business put those subsidiary’s shortcomings into sharp relief — made more glaring still on Friday when Boeing said the unit would have about $2 billion in charges in the third quarter. ', 'It all adds up to the perception of a company that will need more time to regain its footing — the Federal Aviation Administration’s top official has said it’s a matter of years, not months, before Boeing is stabilized. When Ortberg, 64, hosts his first earnings call as CEO on Oct. 23, investors will want more detail on how he intends to comprehensively lead one of the toughest revivals in corporate America, rather than just putting out fires.', '“It’s all getting a bit hand to mouth,” said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners LLP in London. “It is not a coherent plan as such, it is just another quarter of large charges, all of a kind the previous management would have had to make anyway, as they reflect existing and developing problems and are not part of a restructuring as such.”', 'Rating agencies have put Boeing on notice with a warning that it may slip below investment grade, a move that would make the planemaker the biggest so-called fallen angel in corporate US history. The company has only a small buffer on top of the $10 billion of cash and short-term securities that it needs to avoid slipping to jut status. The toll from the strike increases the urgency to tap markets sooner rather than later for fresh financing. ', 'Continuous Loop', '“For every problem that’s come to a head, then severed, more problems sprout up,” Ron Epstein, an analyst with Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients. “The issues all feed into each other, creating a continuous doom loop while compounding the negative impacts.”', 'All told, Boeing will record $5 billion in combined charges for its two largest businesses when it formally reports third-quarter earnings, the company said Friday evening in a surprise announcement. Besides the defense and space charges, Boeing will book additional costs for pushing back its 777X model once more, leaving its largest widebody aircraft with a delay of about six years.', 'Much is unclear about Boeing’s turnaround efforts. The ramp-up in production that was supposed to help cash flow has been undercut by the recent strike, and the defense and space business continues to hemorrhage money. ', 'The company still needs to buy back Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which it had hived off in an ill-fated move almost two decades ago, only to see manufacturing quality at its key supplier suffer as a result. ', 'Longer-term, Boeing may need to make some tough calls on unprofitable areas like its space endeavors. The division made global headlines a few weeks ago when its Starliner capsule returned to earth without humans on board. It was an ignominious end to its first crewed mission to orbit after NASA decided not to risk putting two astronauts back into the glitch-prone spacecraft.', 'Ortberg hasn’t done any media interviews since taking over, although he’s reached out to customers, regulators, Pentagon officials and toured Boeing factories. An engineer by training, Ortberg spent most of his career at what is now known as Collins Aerospace, a well-regarded avionics equipment manufacturer that’s a key supplier to Boeing. ', 'As CEO, Ortberg has appealed to a sense of camaraderie and shared destiny with the workforce. He made a point about relocating to Seattle from West Palm Beach, Florida, in a departure from his predecessor, who largely ran the company from the other side of the continent. ', 'Cash Drain', 'When the strike started in mid September, the CEO urged workers to embrace the future and not hold grudges, a nod to a 2014 contract that cost them their pensions. Senior management took solidarity pay reductions when Ortberg announced furloughs to preserve cash, and the latest job cuts will also include executives and management, he said.', 'But with so-called touch labor accounting for less than 5% for the total cost of a commercial aircraft program, some observers wonder why Boeing isn’t moving with more urgency to end the work stoppage that’s adding to its financial distress. ', '“It’s not a needle mover in terms of Boeing profitability,” said Ken Herbert, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “What are we waiting for here? Every day that goes by, it’s more disruptive and more of a cash drain.” ', 'The strike is cascading through Boeing’s supply chain, heightening the risk that the recovery in the planemaker’s own factories will be slow and halting even once workers are back on the job. And so far, Boeing hasn’t said where the workforce cuts will occur, or what they might cost the company in terms of severance.', '‘Can’t Win’', 'Announcing the job cuts in the middle of labor negotiations is also a strategy fraught with risk.

Boeing's Labor Strike Enters Week 5: How Bad Could This Get?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/13/boeings-labor-strike-enters-week-5-how-bad-is-this/,"['', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', ""Don't believe the rumors. Boeing's not going bankrupt, and it still has options to survive this strike."", ""If you own Boeing (BA -1.34%) stock, you've probably been glued to news of the protracted labor strike by Boeing's machinists union, now entering its fifth week."", 'And you\'ve probably already heard the latest bad news: After two days of renewed talks with union negotiators from the International Association of Machinists (IAM) -- talks that apparently went absolutely nowhere -- Boeing cut off negotiations entirely, withdrew its ""best and final"" offer of a 30% pay raise (spread over four years), and walked away. As Boeing Commercial Aircraft CEO Stephanie Pope explained, ""The union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business.""', 'In response, IAM complained Boeing ""refused to improve wages, retirement plans and vacation or sick leave,"" according to a report by CNBC. On Thursday, Boeing filed an ""unfair labor practices"" complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing IAM of engaging in not negotiating in good faith. ', ""Now, presumably, this story doesn't end here. At some point, Boeing must return to the table. It simply cannot afford to leave its 737, 767, and 777 production lines shut down indefinitely."", 'Depending on whom you ask, Boeing is losing anywhere from $1 billion per week (says The Washington Post) to $1 billion per month (says CNBC) as this strike drags on. Prior guesses have ranged as high as $100 million to $150 million per day (which works out to $3 billion to $4.5 billion per month).', ""Which guess is right? We'll probably not know until Boeing reports its Q3 earnings (which should include results for the first two weeks of the strike). Meanwhile, it's in the union's interests to make Boeing's losses sound as big as possible, to increase pressure on management to agree to its pay hike and pension demands. Conversely, it's in Boeing's interest to make the losses seem as small as believable, to convince workers that it is perfectly content to wait them out."", 'So whichever estimates you hear, make sure to take them with a few grains of salt.', ""That said, here's what we know for sure: According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing lost $1.8 billion through the first half of this year. It's actually been losing money for the past six straight years -- since even before the pandemic. Plus, Boeing has nearly $58 billion in debt on its balance sheet, and interest and principal on those debts must be paid whether or not Boeing's building airplanes as the strike stretches on."", ""So however much the strike is costing Boeing, it's adding to the financial strain this company was under well before the strike began. In what appears to be a first, one local Seattle network -- NBC's King 5 affiliate -- suggested on Thursday that this strike could even end in a bankruptcy filing for Boeing."", ""Admittedly, that's a worst-case scenario. Asked about the potential for a bankruptcy filing, though, a Boeing spokesperson merely declined to comment -- which doesn't exactly inspire confidence."", ""Still, it's worth pointing out: Even if this strike lasts five, six, seven weeks, or more, Boeing has options."", 'For example, in a note released Wednesday, investment bank Wells Fargo predicted Boeing will try to sell stock to raise $10 billion to $15 billion to replace money lost to the strike. The company might also simply take out loans to cover its cash needs.', 'Granted, that wouldn\'t be great for Boeing\'s credit rating, adding more debt on top of a near-$60 billion debt load already. That\'s probably one reason S&P put Boeing on notice for a potential downgrade to its credit rating Thursday. Boeing\'s current rating is ""BBB-,"" which sounds bad, but is still considered investment grade. Now the ratings agency is contemplating cutting Boeing\'s credit rating to BB -- which sounds better, but is in fact a junk bond rating.', ""But it's still an option."", ""It's also worth remembering that in the much direr straits Boeing faced during the pandemic, when demand for airplanes nearly dried up worldwide, Boeing did both these things.

It means reduced expenses as well as the fortitude required to make the toughest choices. For aerospace stock Boeing (BA), however, it meant more running for the door as shareholders sent shares down modestly in Monday afternoon’s trading.', 'Boeing announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce, a move that puzzled many, especially after the one-month anniversary of the machinists’ strike took place. The move is boiling down to the picket lines, as strikers are now concerned about whether or not they will have a job to come back to once the negotiations are done.', 'Boeing announced that it would no longer produce the 767 cargo jet at its Everett plant and revealed that 17,000 jobs—not just blue-collar, but also management and executive jobs—would be cut as Boeing faces a soaring debt load. This led some strikers to express the belief that Boeing is “…playing a game.” Specifically, a striker noted, “…a cat-and-mouse game.” This move comes just days after Boeing filed a formal complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging that the union is negotiating in bad faith.', 'Yet, even as Boeing attempts to right its course, some analysts are still on its side. Rob Stallard, for example, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, declared that he set a Hold rating on Boeing despite the fact that “…it would have been a prime candidate…” for a Sell rating “…some time ago.” But Stallard noted that, thanks to the current “aerospace up-cycle,” Boeing will be an attractive buy for portfolio managers.', 'Counting on portfolio managers to continue to buy a company that is firing employees in the middle of a strike may not be the first tactic that comes to mind, but Stallard does raise some good points about the power of Boeing’s name recognition in aerospace.

About 17,000 workers will be let go. ', 'The cut in freighter production schedules is a potential problem for the air cargo industry, which faces a growing shortfall in international widebody freighter capacity as many aircraft reach retirement age and shipping demand grows at a forecast annual rate of about 4%. ', 'Boeing (NYSE: BA) said it now anticipates first delivery of the 777-9 passenger jet in 2026 and the 777-8 in 2028. It is recognizing an unexpected expense of $2.6 billion against earnings in the third quarter because of the delay. The schedule is being pushed back because of an updated assessment that certification of the modernized 777 jetliner will take longer than planned and delays associated with the strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.', '', '', 'The Commercial Airplanes division also plans to shut production of the 767-300 freighter and take a $400 million charge because of the work stoppage. It will deliver the 29 remaining 767 cargo aircraft on order from FedEx and UPS before terminating the line. Beginning in 2027, the only 767 version that Boeing will continue to make is the KC-46A tanker for the U.S. military.', '“While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company,” said President and CEO Kelly Ortberg, who began in the job two months ago. “These decisive actions, along with key structural changes to our business, are necessary to remain competitive over the long term. We are also focusing on areas that are critical to our future and will ensure we have the balance sheet necessary to invest, support our people and deliver for our customers.”', 'The debut of the 777X family of aircraft, which first flew in 2019, has already been delayed for years for a variety of issues. Boeing finally received Federal Aviation Administration approval for test flights last summer. Testing was slowed because the agency wasn’t satisfied with the technical data it had received from the company. The test flights over a 12-to-18-month period are necessary to certify the upgraded 777-9 airframe for commercial passenger service, with follow-on testing expected for the 777-8 freighter. Qatar Airways is the launch customer for the 777-8 cargo jet.', 'Boeing’s decision to close down the 767 freighter production line is a reversal from efforts to extend production beyond an international deadline. The FAA reauthorization bill signed into law in May includes language allowing Boeing an extra five years to produce 767 freighters for FedEx and UPS beyond the date when international standards mandating cleaner engine types kick in.', '', '', 'The legislation gave Boeing a bridge in the event express carriers needed extra capacity until it can develop a new freighter next decade. Boeing, FedEx and UPS lobbied Congress for a reprieve from the Jan. 1, 2028, production deadline, according to multiple industry sources at the time.  ', 'Boeing has been under white-hot scrutiny from aviation regulators for a long list of production glitches and safety issues since two Max 8 aircraft crashed more than five years ago, killing 346 people. Oversight increased after a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 in January because bolts were missing. Boeing also faces damage to its finances and credibility from the failed Starliner mission that left two astronauts stranded aboard the International Space Station until next year and recent FAA safety warnings about its rudder control system on hundreds of 737 aircraft.
