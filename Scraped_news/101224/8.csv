The energy was moving at 2.5 million mph, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for SWPC, during a virtual media briefing on Oct. 9.', 'Simply put, the solar storm is strong enough to push the charged particles farther south than usual where they interact with gases in the atmosphere and result in streaks of colors dancing through the sky.', 'According to SWPC, a G4 storm results in an Aurora that could be seen as far south as Alabama.', 'Dahl said in the Oct. 9 briefing that SWPC has warned North American power grids, and he said they have begun to take precautions to mitigate any effects from the severe geomagnetic storm.', 'To see the aurora, you will need to go to a place with a view of the northern horizon and limited light pollution. It will be difficult to see it from the center of a city or town.', 'In Pennsylvania, the best bet is to go a high place in the darker and more remote areas of your region. Luckily, much of the state is going to experience clear skies tonight. Western Pennsylvania could see partly cloudy skies.', 'In the press briefing, SWPC Space scientist Rob Steenburgh said cellphone cameras could pick up the Aurora better than the naked eye could.', '""People can pick it up now with their cameras, given the types of sensors that most cellphone cameras have these days,"" he said.

But in 2024, there have been multiple instances of them reaching much further south, including locales as far away as the Florida Keys. So it’s a rare phenomenon and for many, seeing the aurora is on their bucket list.', '“I literally got hundreds of messages each with anywhere from two to a dozen photos [of the aurora],” Berk said about submissions to his Facebook page. “They’re all amazing.”', '“It’s very rare for us here in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic to get them,” said Berk, who follows space weather nearly as closely as local weather, just as a hobby.', 'There are many reasons why: timing, cloud cover, light pollution, luck, your phone, your vision (have you had your eyes checked lately?) But the main one is probably timing, followed closely by your surroundings — basically, how far away from city lights you were able to get. Also, if you were relying on the naked eye, well, don’t. Use your camera phone — it’s more sensitive to light and should be able to capture even faint auroras that humans cannot see.', 'Most important for viewing the aurora in our area is the strength of the storm. Not every burst will reach as far south as the United States, and not all that often into Maryland. And when the geomagnetic storms do occur, the forecast for their arrival can be tricky: the sun is 92.49 million miles from Earth, leaving the ETA literally up in the air.', 'Also, know that the northern lights can arrive in pulses — they can be visible for an hour or 15 minutes, and then disappear, only to reappear two hours later with another burst of color. Thursday night’s storm likely peaked around 10 p.m. in the mid-Atlantic region. Patience is key.', '“It’s almost like a wave lapping up on the shore,” Berk explained. “And you’ll get one wave, and then it will retreat, and you’ll get another wave.”', 'Berk said the sun is in the middle of an 11-year cycle where it is more active with a higher amount of solar storms.', '“It’s sort of on an uptick,” Berk said “We’re in that peak now and maybe over the next year or two” is when the most opportunities to see auroras will happen.', 'So you’re going to want to pay attention to the space weather forecast.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) runs the Space Weather Prediction Center, which offers predictions about solar storms, when they will reach Earth and if they will be strong enough for the lights to be viewed.', 'The website (swpc.noaa.gov) offers a map that shows where the aurora is most likely to be visible. Maryland residents are also going to want to pay attention to the Kp-index, which measures the strength of a geomagnetic or solar storm. In our area, we generally need a severe category storm to reach our latitude, a G4 at least, with a Kp of at least 7 or 8, although there have been reported sightings at slightly lower levels.', '“If you hear that there’s going to be a seven or eight, then the best thing to do is make sure that you get to a dark location — that means away from the city,” Berk said. “And hopefully you have some favorite spot picked out.', '“You know, it could be a park, it could be a hill, it could be a country road, but some place that is far away from city, urban lights, preferably on a higher elevation overlook, on a hill, or if you have a wide open view facing north.”', 'Based on the SWPC forecast, the answer is maybe. While a geomagnetic storm is forecast, it might not be strong enough for viewing tonight in Maryland.', '“There’s a really small chance,” Berk said. “And what I’ve been telling people is that if we do have a storm tonight, odds are it’s going to be much less intense … much harder to see.”', 'Berk noted that when solar storms are less intense, your odds of seeing auroras increase in the darkest, highest elevations, for example, in Western Maryland.', 'But we would never want to discourage sky viewing — our galaxy is amazing — so why not give it a peek when you’re out this evening.', '“It’s an imperfect science,” Berk said, adding that another reason you may have missed the Thursday night show has to do with time.

A severe geomagnetic storm causes colorful auroras over Northern California and Alabama,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/science/solar-storm-aurora-power-gps/index.html,"['', 'Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.', 'Colorful auroras could be visible in areas of the United States such as Alabama and Northern California — much farther south than they typically appear — on Thursday evening due to a powerful solar flare and coronal mass ejection released from the sun, according to the National Weather Service’s Space Weather Prediction Center.', 'The severe solar storm, initially classified as a level 4 on a scale from 1 to 5, also could disrupt communications, the power grid and satellite operations, according to officials at the center.', 'The storm reached Earth at 11:17 a.m. ET Thursday, with the potential to last through Friday. While G3, or strong, storm conditions were observed at 11:49 p.m. ET, scientists at the center confirmed the storm reached G4 conditions at 12:57 p.m. ET.', 'The storm arrived at Earth moving at 1.5 million miles per hour (about 2.4 million kilometers per hour), and reached the Deep Space Climate Observatory and the Advanced Composition Explorer satellites orbiting 1 million miles from Earth about 15 to 30 minutes beforehand.', 'The satellites measure the speed and magnetic intensity of the storm, said Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center, at a news briefing Wednesday.', 'A series of the most intense type of solar flares, known as X-class flares, have released from the sun this week. The flares also coincided with coronal mass ejections on Tuesday.', 'Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field.', '“Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth’s surface,” according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.', 'As a result, the center has notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the North American power grid and satellite operators to prepare for disruptions, especially given the amount of preparations and expected relief efforts for Hurricane Milton, Dahl said.', 'Historically, G4 storms are common during a solar cycle, but G5, or extreme geomagnetic storms such the one that occurred on May 10, are incredibly rare, Dahl said. This new storm has a 25% chance of becoming a G5, he said.', 'As the sun nears solar maximum — the peak in its 11-year cycle, expected this year — it becomes more active, and researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb.', 'Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create those different colored lights in the sky.', 'Currently, scientists at the prediction center believe visible auroras are likely to appear in central Eastern states and the lower Midwest, but it remains to be seen whether the storm will cause a global phenomenon of auroras as the G5 in May did, Dahl said. But if the storm escalates to a G5, auroras could be visible across southern states and elsewhere around the world.', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials recommend using the center’s aurora dashboard to find out whether northern and southern lights are predicted to be visible in your area. The dashboard is constantly updated and can show where an aurora may appear within minutes of the information becoming available.', 'The chance of seeing auroras has also dramatically increased, given that darkness falls earlier during this time of year. Sky-gazers in the US who spied auroras caused by a G3 storm over the weekend witnessed the northern lights within an hour or two after nightfall, Dahl said.', 'And even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up, center officials said.', 'NOAA scientists said they don’t believe this week’s storm will surpass the one in May. Before then, the last G5 storm to hit Earth was in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.', 'During the May geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.', 'The solar storm in May was the most successfully mitigated space weather storm in history, Dahl said.', 'Scientists are continuing to monitor the spikes in solar activity as they increase because they could indicate where the sun currently is in its cycle.', 'The speed of Tuesday’s coronal mass ejection surprised scientists at the center because it’s the fastest measured in this solar cycle so far, Dahl said. But that doesn’t mean the peak of solar activity is occurring right now. Previous solar cycles have shown that some of the biggest storms can happen after the peak, he said.', '“We are in the midst of solar maximum right now; we just don’t know if we reached the peak yet,” Dahl said. “That would be decided later and could be either sometime this year or even early next year. Bottom line is, we’re still in for a ride with the solar cycle activity through this year, as well as the next year and even into early 2026.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

"", ""On Friday, the line will recede somewhat as the geomagnetic storm weakens. By then, it'll be visible to the northern US, including Washington state, Montana, both Dakotas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. "", ""In general, the usual space-viewing tips apply. You'll get a much better view if you get away from the light pollution in large cities. Folks in the suburbs may be able to see it a little better in the northern parts of the US, but if you're on the fringe, you'll want to get out of town for a bit to get the best view. "", ""A lot of people have had success using their phone cameras to take pictures of the sky, which tends to capture the northern lights better than the human eye does. So, if you're in range and can't see it, point your phone camera at the darkest part of the northern sky and you might be able to capture a good picture of it. You may need to tinker with your camera settings a bit to get the optimum results."", 'Read more: Take Better Night-Mode Photos With These Easy Pro Photography Tips']"
