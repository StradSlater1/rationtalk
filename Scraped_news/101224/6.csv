That year, Obama's diverse voting coalition was headlined by overwhelming support from Black and young voters, two groups that Harris needs to win in November."", ""But Obama's remarks while in Pittsburgh on Thursday sparked a major debate about Black voters and their loyalty to the Democratic Party and former President Donald Trump's push to make inroads with the key group."", '""You\'re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,"" Obama said of Black male voters.

However, Black women remained strongly in Harris' corner, backing her by an 83% to 12% margin."", ""While Obama's pitch may have rubbed some people the wrong way, Democrats know they need robust Black support to win in November."", 'And the Times/Siena survey showed the work that lies ahead for Harris as she campaigns to succeed Biden in the White House.', '']"

That’s one heck of a bumper sticker message. And it comes from America’s first Black president — the hope and change candidate — in a message directed explicitly at Black men.', 'In a speech in Pittsburgh on Thursday, former President Barack Obama singled out Black men for what he sees as their reluctance to back Harris. Prediction: Black women will be the most pro-Harris voting bloc come November. The second most pro-Harris, pro-freedom, pro-democracy voting group? You probably didn’t guess it: Black men. But still, Obama, who has made a habit of lecturing Black people to show he isn’t beholden to them and to allay White fears, felt the need to “admonish” Black men, as the Washington Post headline said. He was “stern,” according to the New York Times headline, in calling out the “brothers” (Fox News).', '“The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,” said Obama, who also met with a group of Black voters earlier in the day. “When we get in trouble, and the system isn’t working for us, they’re the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you because you think that’s a sign of strength because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable.”', 'So eager to prove that he isn’t beholden to Black people — he is the president of all Americans, he would often say — Obama has frequently singled out Black people for reprimanding. This approach only underscores the stereotype of Black Americans as a problem that needs solving. He once told the Congressional Black Caucus to stop grumbling and put on their marching shoes. It’s doubtful that icons of the civil rights movement like the late congressman John Lewis or Representative Jim Clyburn needed to hear that from him. He lectured Black people not to “just sit in the house watching SportsCenter” or brag about an eighth-grade education. And he told a group of Morehouse graduates during a commencement speech — among the best and brightest of Black Americans — that they needed to stop complaining.', '“Why are Black men being belittled in ways that no other voting group [is]?” former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, a Democrat, said Thursday on CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip.“Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out Black men is wrong.”', 'Harris supporters were out post-speech doing damage control.

Columnist Jonathan Alter wrote in 2008 that Obama’s “most exciting potential for moral leadership could be in the African-American community.” Because, of course, Black Americans needed this the most. (Speaking of moral leadership, fast forward eight years to when the majority of White Americans would cast their ballots for Donald Trump, something they are poised to do again.)', 'But as Harris, who has run a nearly flawless race in a compressed timeline, tries to take her turn at history, it is Black voters, specifically Black men, who are being scapegoated. Remember that in a state like Michigan in 2020, Black men were 5% of the electorate, and 88% of their ballots went to Joe Biden. White people were 80% of the electorate. Are there any lectures for them on racism or sexism from Obama? It’s true that Obama, at times, was speaking to all men, but he landed most harshly on Black men, the most pro-Kamala group and one of the smallest voting blocs of the electorates.', 'Strategist types have criticized the Harris campaign for what they see as a lack of effective outreach to Black men. They’re big on complaints but short on suggestions. At an event with the National Association of Black Journalists, Harris was asked about her standing among Black men, a group being set up as a collective fall guy if she fails to win the White House.', ""“I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that Black men are in anybody’s pocket,” Harris said in a sit-down interview with a panel from the group. “I'm working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am Black.”"", 'Black men, at a higher rate than men of every other group, will go with their daughters and their wives and their sisters and their aunts to the voting booth so they can all make history together. Perhaps that’s the picture Obama could paint, one of hope and change, not condescension. Jesse Jackson, who, more than anyone, paved the way for the Obama presidency, famously said that Obama talked down to black people. Jackson’s message was mostly lost because it was wrapped in vulgarity. But, it turns out, he was right.', 'Black men don’t need to be torn down. They don’t need to be condescended to. They don’t need to be scolded. What they need is a president who sees them, hears them and makes their lives better — just like every other American. Harris is making that case to them as best she can by listening, not lecturing.

That naturally led to an audience joke about Trump wearing adult diapers, which turned out to be extremely apt, given that at his own rally in Michigan, the ex-president unwittingly proved he is, in fact, a very large baby.', 'In Pittsburgh, Obama told the crowd that while he understands that some people are unhappy with the economy and want a president who will “shake things up,” he can’t understand “why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you…There is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself. I’ve said it before: Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.” Praising Harris’s proposal to give a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, the 44th president said: “Because I don’t have to tell a lot of you, raising kids is hard, and she wants to make it easier to afford stuff like a crib or a car seat or diapers.

I want to take the time to transcribe it for you in full, because I haven’t seen anyone do it elsewhere and I find it to be incredibly revealing in its own way about both Democratic anxieties and Democratic vanities. The video captures Obama striding into a room full of black Harris voters – campaign staff and volunteers – on what he clearly believes to be a mission of mercy.', 'I’m here to go ahead and speak some truths if you don’t mind. Because my understanding based on reports I’m getting from campaigns and communities is that we have not yet seen the same kind of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.', 'So if you don’t mind just for a second I’m gonna speak to y’all and say that when you have a choice that is this clear, when on the one hand you have somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences, who’s able to work harder and do more and overcome and achieves the second-highest office in the land and is putting forward concrete proposals to correctly address the things that are vital in our neighborhoods and communities, from housing to making sure that our mothers and our fathers and grandparents can afford medicine, and making sure that we are dealing with prices that are too high, and rents that are too high, and is committed to making sure we maintain the Affordable Care Act so everybody’s got healthcare, and cares about things like education, and entrepreneurship in our neighborhood.', 'Note that this last paragraph was one single extemporized run-on sentence. Put that thought in your back pocket for a moment.', 'And that’s on one side and on the other side you have someone who has consistently shown disregard not just for communities but for you as a person. And you’re thinking about sitting out? And you’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses? I’ve got a problem with that. Because, because part of it makes me think – and I’m speaking to men directly – part of it makes me think that well, you just aren’t “feeling” the idea of having a woman as president. And you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for it. And I think anybody you’re talking to in a barbershop, anybody you’re talking to in your house, in your family, at church who is coming with that kind of attitude? I think you have to ask them, “Well how could that be?” because the women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time. They’ve been raising us and working and having our backs and when we get in trouble and the system’s not working for us they’re the ones who’re out there marching and protesting, and so now you’re thinking about sitting out, or even supporting somebody? Who has a history of denigrating you? Because you think that’s a sign of strength? Because that’s what you think being a man is, putting women down? That’s not acceptable. That’s not—this shouldn’t even be a question.', 'It was a remarkable declaration of frustration, and a truly revealing one. Obama went out later that night in Pittsburgh and delivered a rally address that hit on some of the same themes, but with none of the specificity to African-American male voters as this quieter, less publicized cry. Put bluntly: There are clearly enough black men in the Democratic coalition who are skeptical of Kamala and unoffended enough by Trump to terrify the people crunching numbers inside the campaign. You do not send Barack Obama, of all people, out there to sermonize to “the brothers” — note the sudden duck into the vernacular, a tell from the patrician Obama if ever there was one — about this unless the Harris campaign is sweating over the vote of what was supposed to be their core demographic like Ted Stryker landing an airplane.', 'And they aren’t jumping at shadows, either. The most recent New York Times/Siena national poll also made sure to oversample black voters on the side to get a better sense of nationwide African-American trends, and their numbers showed that Donald Trump was currently on track for something like 15 percent of the black vote versus Kamala Harris’s 78 percent. That may obviously seem like a lopsided number to some, but as anyone who ever watched a Republican win statewide in Illinois despite Democrats netting “only” 78 percent of Chicago can tell you, it’s small shifts in the margin that make all the difference. Men are driving Trump’s unusual strength among black voters relative to typical Republicans, and the problematic news is that they live in both Sun Belt states and Blue Wall states in potentially decisive numbers. (There aren’t as many black male voters in Arizona as in other states, but I have unfortunate news for the Harris campaign about the other decisive ethnic demographic currently swinging in Trump’s direction.)', 'The petulance of Obama’s tone was perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the entire encounter, and what bodes most ill for Harris underneath the surface. There is something supremely condescending about the way Obama comes out, with vinegar sobriety, and addresses Harris’s weaknesses while fulminating about how black men just aren’t feeling the joy. Remember that run-on sentence from the top of this piece, the one I told you to stash in your back pocket? That was Obama, clearly improvising on the fly, trying to first describe all the good qualities of Kamala Harris, all the things she supposedly brought to the table for black men, the obvious reasons she was supposed to be “your candidate.”', 'And yet it was almost comical how he sounded like he was describing a different person altogether. An ideal candidate, the candidate he wished Kamala was, the candidate he (Barack Obama, super-genius) would be: “somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences, who’s able to work harder and do more and overcome and achieves the second-highest office in the land and is putting forward concrete proposals,” etc. That sounds like a great pitch for a candidate to me, too, honestly; does it remind you (or black voters for that matter) in any way of Kamala Harris?', 'This is the disconnect that Obama cannot intellectually or politically allow himself to acknowledge, so instead, his default explanation is: Black men are sexist self-hating pigs who should feel guilty about possibly voting for Trump or simply not voting for Harris. Why? Because she’s black, and she’s a woman, and black women have supported you your entire lives, so transfer that onto her, I guess. (Yes, Barack Obama wants you to vote for Kamala Harris — of all people! — as your mom or nana.) It’s a shamelessly unintellectual argument, an appeal to pure tribalism, and the sort of thing someone as smart as Obama deploys only after every other better weapon at hand has failed, and public shaming is all that remains.', 'I suspect it will be as ineffective as all such appeals to alienated voters are, even though I remain skeptical of Trump’s final share of the black vote in November. (Try as I might, I just can’t see Charlie Kirk cleverly micro-targeting inner-city black turnout to get Trump over the hump.) But it is worth noting that, with this little mini-speech, Barack Obama has now stepped into the shoes of someone he does not admire but grudgingly respects: Bill Clinton. Clinton famously got increasingly agitated over the way his wife’s campaign seemed to be completely uninterested in tending to the homefires of the “blue wall” back in 2016.

It’s a bold strategy; we will see how it turns out.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2024 National Review', 'Newsletters', '', 'Free Articles Left This Month', 'Enjoy full access with an NRPLUS membership.', 'Already a member?

He’d pass by a custodian and say ‘Hey Jimmy, how’s the family?’', '“He used his influence to get more Black and brown coaches in the NFL,” Mr. Obama said, referring to the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which aims to increase the number of minorities hired in head coach, general manager, and executive positions. “He gave back to his community. He was known for his integrity.', '“It’s so different from what we see out of the Republican nominee,” he said.', 'Mr. Obama said one of the most disturbing aspects of this election season is “how we seem to have set aside the values people like Dan stood for.”', 'He especially got agitated at Trump’s claims that the U.S. was not responding adequately to the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, even as Republican officials in the affected states refuted those allegations.', '“It used to be we had arguments about tax policy or foreign policy. We didn’t have arguments about whether you should tell the truth or not,” Mr. Obama said. “You have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points.

He didn’t do nothing except those big tax cuts.”', 'Mr. Obama acknowledged that Americans have been through a lot, especially during the pandemic and then the rise in prices as the economy began recovering. But he said Trump was the wrong person to fix anything.', '“There are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there,” Mr. Obama said. “I get it, why people are looking to shake things up. I understand people frustrated, feeling we can do better. I cannot understand why anybody will think Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania. There is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself.”', 'Trump Pennsylvania campaign spokesman Kush Desai said no one is going to listen to Mr. Obama.', '“An Obama visit isn’t going to convince Pennsylvanians to vote for another four years of open borders, rising prices, and disaster at home and abroad,” Mr. Desai said.', 'Attendance to Mr. Obama’s speech was limited, with supporters receiving links to click on in order to reserve seats, and some of them not knowing until Wednesday whether they would be admitted.

', 'We’re coming your way next week—come hang out with us! And in the meantime: Happy Friday.', 'by Bill Kristol', 'Barack Obama was on the campaign trail in Pittsburgh yesterday for Kamala Harris. He gave a polished and effective speech before a boisterous crowd. But the most striking moment of his visit were informal comments he made when he stopped by a local campaign headquarters right before.', 'Obama thanked the volunteers for their efforts. But he decided to say something more. He remarked that he was concerned by a lack of energy on behalf of Harris, one that “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.”', 'Obama noted that the apparent lack of enthusiasm among younger black men existed despite the fact that Harris’s opponent has “shown disregard” not just for the black community in general, “but for you as a person.”', 'What accounts for this? Obama was willing to speculate:', 'You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I’ve got a problem with that. Because part of it makes me think—and I’m speaking to men directly—part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that. You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable.', 'It was an unusual moment in contemporary American politics: Unscripted, candid, even bold. Obama’s remarks will surely be much commented on in the next few days. They’ll be quoted in longer journalistic and academic articles about race in America, gender in America, the intersection of race and gender in America, and the like. That’s good. We should discuss such sensitive matters openly and candidly.', 'In that spirit, let me make two points.', 'The first is that Harris is doing as well among younger black voters as Joe Biden was. Maybe sexism is holding her back from doing much better than Biden. Still, the fact remains that black Americans—including younger black men—are overwhelmingly going to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket, and against Donald Trump. There will be more defections among young black men than among older black voters or black women, but Harris still wins young black men by better than two-to-one.', 'The more important point is this: If you believe it’s important to defeat Trump, it’s not Obama’s “brothers” who are the problem. It’s my “brothers” who are the problem: white voters.', 'You want to know why Trump has a decent chance to win the presidency again? Because most white Americans support him. In the latest New York Times/Siena poll, Trump wins white voters by 52 percent to 44 percent.', 'And while Trump has an almost two-to-one margin among white non-college graduates, he doesn’t do that badly with white college graduates, taking close to two-in-five of that cohort. This is a much higher percentage of support for Trump than among any group of black Americans.', 'So all credit to Obama for trying to persuade members of his own community, who voted overwhelmingly for him, to turn out as strongly for Harris. It would be nice if others who’d gotten tens of millions of votes for president, such as George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, were also out there trying to persuade those Americans who voted for them—which includes a majority of white voters—to do the same.', 'But that’s apparently too much to ask.', 'What’s not too much to ask is that we recognize this fact: If Trump wins on November 5, it will be because of his support from a majority of white America. As a white American, and a white American man to boot, I’ve got to say, in the immortal words of Pogo: We have met the enemy and he is us.', 'The Bulwark is a reader-supported publication.

You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”', 'Naturally, this drew widespread attention and denunciations, from Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan to Harris herself.', 'And yet this wasn’t some gaffe or aberration on Trump’s part. The guy has trashed a number of American cities routinely, for years, as cautionary tales of Democratic policy run amok. There’s little reason to believe this sort of thing hurts him with voters.', 'The press is good at covering Trump when he plays the jerk or the villain. But I’ve wondered for a while whether so much focus on those elements of his persona actually play to Trump’s benefit. Some people see his badness as some kind of bankshot testament to his ruthless policy efficiency. He doesn’t get caught up in PC nonsense. He delivers hard truths and makes the trains run on time.', 'But of course that’s not true, which is the other main thing that comes through when you actually watch Trump for any length of time: He’s a blowhard doofus with soup for brains. Open up a video of his full remarks from Detroit, click on any spot at random, and you’ll see the real Trump on full display—tonelessly phoning in his teleprompted speech for a bit, then taking a quick vacation to ramble into the most insipid cul-de-sacs of ad-libbing you’ve ever seen:', 'For generations, this city and state were the world capital of automotive production, and American automakers rolled one iconic model off the line after the next—the Mustang, the Corvette, the Pontiac GTO—I had two of them actually. I had that GTO, oh, I thought I was the hottest guy around, it was crazy. We didn’t have all of the foreign competition then. We were so proud to have the Corvette—oh, if you had a Corvette—I never got a Corvette, I tell you, I feel—I was left behind. But I had my GTO, I was something, man. I put that top down. See in those days I didn’t mind when the hair waved. I’d go fast and that hair would be waving, that blonde hair, and I’d say, ‘Who the hell can take me?’ Nobody. Today I’m a little more careful. I want to cover up that little area up there. It’s a little bit soft up there. Cover it up. No, it was great. But you did, you had the greatest product. It was just fantastic.', 'Vote for Trump! You’re gonna feel cool, like you used to, back when you had all your hair!', 'A bit later, Trump had another important score to settle: with the New York Times’s Peter Baker, who has written about Trump’s claims to have once been honored in Michigan as somebody’s “man of the year.” Trump actually brought a physical prop for this one, pulling a printout of a news article out of his jacket pocket:', 'The fake news, we have such fake news. I mean, I’ve had a recent thing where, as an example, an Obama disciple named Peter Baker—he writes for the failing New York Times—he wrote a piece about me, and just one of the many things he said that was wrong, he said that I would go around saying that I was honored here years ago as the Man of the Year or whatever. And I talked about how your car industry—this was long before, many years before I ran for president, maybe 18 or 20 years ago. And he made the statement that that never took place. That honor never took place. I was never honored here. Which was quite insulting, actually. I didn’t remember the specifics of it, it was 18 or 20 years ago. But he said it never took place. Much like Kamala said she worked at McDonalds and she didn’t. I didn’t want to get into that. So what I did is, I asked my people, you’ve got to find it. When, it was like 19 years—it was a long time. But I was honored. And guess what? They found it. I was.', 'In fact, the local paper whose printout Trump was brandishing said afterward that their article had been mistaken: Trump never had actually been declared “man of the year” after all. But more to the point: Who could possibly care about any of this? How is this possibly part of Trump’s closing pitch, with weeks to go before the election?', 'The answer, of course, is that it’s important to Trump for the same reason everything is important to Trump. Anything that inflates his ego is worth fighting for. In that way, of course, Trump’s stupidity and his evil overlap: He needs to have been man of the year in Michigan decades ago for the same reason he needed to try to steal the 2020 election.', 'Still, maybe we should all be making an effort to focus on the stupid a bit more.', 'Share', 'THE SILVER TONGUE: One other highlight worth noting from Obama’s Pittsburgh rally yesterday: the way he tackled a segment on January 6th.', '“Donald Trump was told that Mike Pence was in the Capitol, about 40 feet from an angry mob chanting ‘Hang Mike Pence.’ And his response was, ‘So what?’” Obama said. “If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you?”', 'As JVL pointed out on YouTube last night, we live in a clown world where a whole lot of voters aren’t sparing much of a thought to what one of the candidates tried to do after he lost the last election. But voters are plainly responding to Harris’s ‘Trump’s not in this for you’ messaging; after all, she’s increasingly leaned into it as her main theme. Obama smartly weaved that messaging into a point he was making about January 6th.', 'We’d prefer to live in a world where one didn’t have to practice rhetorical jujitsu just to make people remember an attempt to steal a presidential election four years ago! But that’s the world we do live in, and it was artfully done.', 'WITH ELITES LIKE THESE: The New York Times reports this morning that Elon Musk is throwing himself personally into the election “in a manner unprecedented in modern history.”', 'The Times notes that Musk “is now talking to the Republican candidate multiple times a week” and “has effectively moved his base of operations to Pennsylvania, the place that he has recently told confidants he believes is the linchpin to Mr. Trump’s reelection.”', 'He has also funded his super PAC with tens of millions of dollars and “proposed taking a campaign bus tour across Pennsylvania and knocking on doors himself, in part to see how his money is being used.”', 'It’s a remarkable and scary thing to watch: the world’s richest man basically trying to buy an election, with promises from his candidate that he will then get to oversee a massive government portfolio.
