"Analysis-Caught between competing goals in Lebanon, US stays on the sidelines",https://www.aol.com/news/analysis-caught-between-competing-goals-100844252.html,"['Advertisement', '', '', 'By Simon Lewis and Humeyra Pamuk', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After weeks of intensive diplomacy aimed at securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah militants, the United States has settled on an altogether different approach: let the unfolding conflict in Lebanon play out.', ""Just two weeks ago, the United States and France were demanding an immediate 21-day ceasefire to ward off an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. That effort was derailed by Israel's assassination of Hezbollah leader Syed Hassan Nasrallah, the Oct. 1 launch of Israeli ground operations in southern Lebanon and Israeli airstrikes that have wiped out much of the group's leadership."", 'Now, U.S. officials have dropped their calls for a ceasefire, arguing that circumstances have changed.', '""We do support Israel launching these incursions to degrade Hezbollah\'s infrastructure so ultimately we can get a diplomatic resolution,"" State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing earlier this week.', 'The course change reflects conflicting U.S. goals - containing the ever-growing Middle East conflict while also severely weakening Iran-backed Hezbollah.', 'The new approach is both practical and risky.', ""The US and Israel would benefit from the defeat of a common enemy - Hezbollah, which Tehran uses to threaten Israel's northern border - but encouraging Israel's widening military campaign risks a conflict that spins out of control."", 'Jon Alterman, a former State Department official, said the U.S. wants to see Hezbollah weakened but must weigh that against the risk of “creating a vacuum” in Lebanon or provoking a regional war.', 'Washington\'s approach, he said, seems to be: ""If you can\'t change the Israeli approach, you might as well try to channel it in a constructive way.""', 'A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY', ""Israel's latest fight with Hezbollah started when the group fired missiles at Israeli positions immediately after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas gunmen on Israel that triggered the Gaza war. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire ever since."", ""As months of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas went nowhere, Israel in September began ramping up its bombardment of Hezbollah and landed painful blows on the group, including remotely detonating Hezbollah pagers and radios, wounding thousands of the group's members."", 'After Nasrallah\'s death - which the U.S. called ""a measure of justice"" - U.S. President Joe Biden called again for a ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border.', ""The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched its ground invasion anyway and within a few days the U.S. had dropped its calls for a ceasefire and expressed support for its ally's campaign."", 'Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. Middle East negotiator, said Washington had little hope of restraining Israel and saw potential benefits in the operation.', '""It certainly created momentum in which the administration probably thought, \'Let’s make a virtue out of necessity\',"" he said, adding that U.S. officials were also likely reserving leverage to try and curtail Israel\'s retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.', 'Today, no meaningful ceasefire talks are underway, said European sources familiar with the matter, adding that Israelis would press ahead with their operation in Lebanon ""for weeks if not months."" Two U.S. officials told Reuters that might well be the timeline.', 'For the U.S. the Israeli campaign could bring at least two benefits.', ""First, weakening Hezbollah - Iran's most powerful proxy militia - could curb Tehran's influence in the region and lower the threat to Israel and to U.S. forces."", 'Washington also believes that military pressure could force Hezbollah to put down arms and pave the way for the election of a new government in Lebanon that would oust the powerful militia movement, which has been a significant player in Lebanon for decades.', 'Jonathan Lord, a former Pentagon official now with the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said that would be hard to achieve.', '""On the one hand, many Lebanese people bristle under the weight of Hezbollah\'s presence in Lebanon. But at the same time ... this change is being foisted upon Lebanon through a very violent campaign,"" Lord said.', 'RISKY STRATEGY', 'The ultimate goal, U.S. officials said this week, is to enforce United Nations Security Council resolution 1701, which mandated a U.N. peacekeeping mission - known as UNIFIL - to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state.', ""U.S. officials say the conversations with parties to achieve these goals can take place as the fighting continues, even though analysts warn the conflict greatly increases the risk of a broader war, particularly as the region awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile strike."", 'Beyond the chance of a war that could draw in the United States, there is the fear that Lebanon becomes another Gaza.', ""A year of Israeli military operations have reduced the enclave to a wasteland and killed nearly 42,000 people, according to Gaza health officials. U.S. officials openly warn Israel's offensive in Lebanon should not at all resemble that of the Gaza Strip."", 'Despite those dangers, Alterman, who now heads the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the diplomacy is unlikely to stop the fighting anytime soon.', '""Netanyahu sees all of his gambles paying off and it strikes me as a hard moment for Israel to feel like it should stop pressing its advantage,” he said.', '(Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick in Washington and John Irish in Paris; Writing by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Don Durfee and Deepa Babington)', 'Advertisement', 'ABC News', 'Fox News', 'NY Post US News articles', 'Advertisement']"

Egypt and Qatar have reportedly refused to lend their support, viewing the plan as “unrealistic and even dangerous” due to their officials’ view that Israel will not succeed in destroying Hezbollah, and that any political resolution will be too fragile and unstable without the involvement of the group.', 'Cairo in particular also reportedly expressed its concern that any international interference in Lebanese politics at such a scale would have the potential to ignite internal divisions and tensions remaining from Lebanon’s civil war over three decades ago.', 'Read: Is Iran about to let go of its regional allies, from Yemen to Lebanon?

In parallel, US Secretary of “War” Lloyd Austin has requested his Israeli counterpart, “War” Minister Yoav Galant, to “move from military operations to the diplomatic track quickly.”', 'Washington is pressuring at all levels to elect Army Commander Joseph Aoun as President of Lebanon. In an interview with Lebanon’s MTV (anti-resistance channel), Hochstein has highlighted Washington’s desire for “the presidential election to be held quickly.” This demonstrated Washington’s conviction that “Israel” is quite reluctant to proceed with its ground invasion of Lebanon. Hochstein’s statement has revealed Washington’s intention to create a buffer zone at the Lebanese-Palestinian border as soon as possible in fear of escalatory operations by Hezbollah in the upcoming weeks.', 'Lebanon’s elite and ordinary citizens fully realize that the United States is the main and only party concerned with stopping the aggression and that it has proposed this condition of “surrender” to blackmail the resistant people.', 'According to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, Washington spent no less than $22.76 billion on military aid to the occupying colonial entity between October 7, 2023 and September 30, 2024 (the largest recipient of US aid since World War II / the cumulative value of US aid to date is approximately $251.2 billion).', 'According to an agreement concluded under the Obama administration for the period 2019-2028, the Israeli occupation regime receives $3.8 billion annually in US military aid, including $500 million allocated to fund missile “defence” systems. However, this announced figure is not the actual value of US support; neither the Pentagon nor the State Department have provided comprehensive lists of the aid delivered to the occupation entity, as was the case with regard to the transfer of weapons to Ukraine.', 'Historically, the Israeli army has provided intelligence to the Israeli army and largely helped it economically, militarily, and diplomatically along with developing its arms industry. During the 1960s, the Kennedy administration was keen to increase this military aid as the US administration considered the occupation entity a strategic ally against the Soviet Union. After the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978, military support increased steadily.', 'In March 2024, The Washington Post revealed that the Biden administration had concluded at least 100 arms deals with the occupation entity without informing Congress of the details of the deal.

For those of us witnessing this from abroad, the pain is intensified by the helplessness of distance. We are not merely watching a war; we are witnessing the slow, systematic disintegration of a country that once held so much promise. Lebanon is slipping away, and what makes it even harder to bear is the fact that we can do little more than watch.

Lebanon is no longer on the brink—it has plunged into freefall. What was already a fragile state, crippled by division and dysfunction, is now being ravaged by war, compounding an economic crisis that has left millions in poverty and a political system in complete paralysis. This catastrophe didn’t emerge overnight; it is the result of decades of corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of Lebanon’s vulnerabilities by external powers. Each blow drags Lebanon deeper into chaos, with regional actors capitalizing on the country’s instability for their own gain, while Lebanon’s leaders either stand idle or lack the will to reverse the collapse. ', 'Lebanon has become more than just a battleground for foreign agendas—it has become a place where the dreams of its people are systematically crushed under the weight of forces beyond their control. Those who once believed in Lebanon’s promise, in its rich culture and resilience, now watch as their hopes fade. It is not only the physical destruction of homes or the loss of livelihoods that cuts so deeply; it is the theft of a future, the slow erasure of a country we once knew and loved. The tragedy is not just that Lebanon is slipping away—it’s that we, its people, are powerless to stop it. ', ""Since 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost over 98% of its value, wiping out life savings and leaving citizens grappling with the daily struggle to afford basic necessities. Inflation has skyrocketed beyond 250%, making essentials like food, medicine, and fuel unattainable for most. The country, which relies on imports for more than 80% of its goods, is caught in a vicious cycle of rising costs and shrinking resources.  Lebanon's GDP has contracted by nearly 60% over the past four years, and without intervention, the economy is expected to shrink even further, with expected annual contractions in the range of 10-15% annually. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s foreign reserves have dwindled from $30 billion in 2019 to a mere $8.5 billion today, a stark reminder that the country is on the verge of complete economic collapse.

For years, activists, particularly in Washington, have urged Lebanon’s corrupt sectarian leaders to implement reforms, believing political leadership could steer the nation toward recovery. However, this hope is increasingly misplaced. Expecting the same leaders who drove Lebanon into collapse to now deliver the reforms necessary to rescue it is akin to asking arsonists to rebuild the house they set ablaze. "", 'As the crises and war intensify, these activists along with some Lebanese factions have shifted their focus to electing a new president, hoping this might offer a pathway to recovery. Yet, this approach is superficial at best. Electing a new president from the same political class responsible for Lebanon’s collapse will not change the underlying dynamics. Even if a new leader is chosen, they will likely have to negotiate with Hezbollah, further entrenching the status quo and stifling meaningful reform. ', 'At the same time, external forces are exacerbating Lebanon’s instability. Israel is intensifying its military offensive, taking advantage of the United States’ distraction with its upcoming elections. Regional powers are leveraging Lebanon’s vulnerability to serve their own interests, trapping the country in a geopolitical struggle that overshadows any real potential for internal change. ', 'The true tragedy is that Lebanon’s people—the real victims—are caught between these internal failures and external ambitions. Whether through electing a president or calling for reforms, Lebanon’s political system is fundamentally ill-equipped to resolve its own crisis. The country needs far more than just a new figurehead; it requires a comprehensive overhaul, something its current political elite is unlikely to deliver. The longer this political charade continues, the deeper Lebanon will fall into the abyss. ', 'Lebanon is at a crossroads. Without intervention, the country risks fragmenting into enclaves controlled by warlords and foreign interests. What Lebanon needs is real, systemic change—a path that no president, elected under the current conditions, can offer. ', 'To ensure Lebanon doesn’t spiral back into instability, a comprehensive strategy is required, focusing on the disarmament of militias and the restoration of the state’s sovereignty. ', 'The immediate priority must be an internationally backed ceasefire, supported by the United States, France, and other global powers, to stop the destruction and allow humanitarian aid to flow. However, this is just the first step. To ensure Lebanon doesn’t spiral back into instability, a comprehensive strategy is required, focusing on the disarmament of militias and the restoration of the state’s sovereignty. Without these measures, Lebanon will remain vulnerable to external exploitation, making any recovery efforts futile. ', 'At the same time, rebuilding Lebanon’s capacity to maintain security is essential. A key element in this strategy is strengthening the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). While Lebanon has received $3 billion in US military aid since 2006, this pales in comparison to the $3.8 billion Israel receives annually. This disparity underscores the need for greater US and international support for the LAF, which remains one of the few neutral institutions capable of restoring order and curbing Hezbollah’s influence. Without increased backing, the LAF will struggle to contain non-state actors, leaving Lebanon vulnerable to further fragmentation and destabilization. ', 'Lebanon’s future hinges on immediate, decisive action from the international community. Past efforts, such as the Baabda Declaration and similar neutrality frameworks, have failed to secure Lebanon’s sovereignty. The country’s sectarian political system, combined with the influence of external actors, ensures that political progress will remain elusive unless these broader dynamics are addressed. ', 'Hezbollah’s military presence and the power of sectarian elites make neutrality in Lebanon almost impossible. Electing a president alone, without dismantling these entrenched power structures, will not resolve the crisis. The international community must push for the full enforcement of UN Resolution 1559, which includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories, including Chebaa Farms, and the disarmament of militias. Restoring Lebanon’s sovereignty requires that no group outside the state holds weapons or authority. ', 'In the current political environment, electing a president without addressing these root causes would be both ineffective and dangerous. Any new leader would either come from the same corrupt political elite or be forced to make concessions to Hezbollah, which continues to operate independently of the state. ', 'The stakes are too high for inaction. Lebanon’s collapse would have catastrophic implications, not only for its citizens but for the entire region. A disintegrating Lebanon could create a power vacuum that regional actors would rush to fill, further destabilizing the Middle East. Stabilizing Lebanon is not just a moral imperative—it is a strategic necessity for global security. ', 'The international community must act now. Only through these steps can Lebanon begin the process of rebuilding its state and institutions.

The people of Lebanon want the same thing. We believe that the best way to get there is through a diplomatic understanding, one that we’ve been working on for some time, and one that we focus on right now.”\nHe said the United States would work to support the fragile Lebanese state to build itself up after Hezbollah’s long-held sway.\n“It’s clear that the people of Lebanon have an interest — a strong interest — in the state asserting itself and taking responsibility for the country and its future,” he said.\nHe also said that the United States was voicing concern directly to Israel on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n“I have real concern about the inadequacy of the assistance that’s getting to them,” Blinken said, adding that the United States has been “very directly engaged with Israel” on the topic.', 'Concern in Asia about prospect of Middle East conflicts', 'US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said also on Friday there was deep concern in Asia about the plight of people in Gaza and conflict in the Middle East and stressed Washington was doing everything in its power to prevent those from spreading.\nSpeaking in Laos after the East Asia Summit, Blinken said concerns about the Middle East came up in conversations with other leaders, during which he reiterated Washington was dedicated to diplomacy to control the situation in the face of what he called an Iranian-led axis of resistance.\n“The intense focus of the United States, which has been the case going back a year, and doing just that, (is) preventing these conflicts from spreading. And we’re working on that every day,” Blinken told a press conference.\n“We’re working very hard through deterrence and through diplomacy to prevent that from happening. There’s also obviously deep concern that we share about the plight of children, women, and men in Gaza, who for now a year have been caught in a terrible crossfire of Hamas’ instigation.”\nBlinken also said the United States was directly engaged with Israel to stress how imperative it was that the humanitarian needs of people in Gaza are met.\nIsrael had the right to defend itself from attacks from Hezbollah, he added, and like the United States, it had a clear and legitimate interest in creating an environment where tens of thousands of displaced people in southern Lebanon can return to their homes.\n“It’s also vitally important that in doing that, they focus on making sure that civilians are protected and, again, are not being caught in a terrible crossfire,” he said.\nBlinken also gave his reassurances of the US commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, adding it was critical to US interests.\n“Even with everything else going on, our focus has remained intensely on this region,” he said.\n“It’s my belief that basic approach will continue, irrespective of who’s president, because it’s so manifestly in our interest.”\n“There’s strong support in Congress for our engagement in the region across parties and across both houses of Congress.

It said in a statement that the diplomats were told to leave India by the end of Saturday.\nThe ministry had said earlier Monday that India was withdrawing its diplomats, after rejecting Canada’s diplomatic communication on Sunday that said the Indian ambassador was a “person of interest” in the assassination.\nA second senior Canadian official said that Canada expelled the Indian diplomats first before they withdrew. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year that there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the June 2023 assassination in Canada of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Mike Duheme said that police have evidence allegedly tying Indian government agents to homicides and other violent acts in Canada. He declined to provide specifics.\n“The team has learned a significant amount of information about the breadth and depth of criminal activity orchestrated by agents of the government of India, and consequential threats to the safety and security of Canadians and individuals living in Canada,” Duheme said.\nRCMP Assistant Commissioner Brigitte Gauvin called it extremely concerning.\n“Indian diplomats and consular officials are to protect the interests of their nationals based in Canada and their national interest and not to be part of criminal activity or intimidation, so we take that very seriously. That is without a doubt a contravention of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” Gauvin said.\nIndia has rejected the accusation as absurd.\nNijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck in June 2023 after he left the Sikh temple he led in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland.\nIndia designated him a terrorist in 2020, and at the time of his death had been seeking his arrest for alleged involvement in an attack on a Hindu priest.\nIn response to the allegations, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Ever since, the relations between the two countries have been frosty.\nThe pro-Khalistan, or Sikh independence, movement is a thorny issue between India and Canada. New Delhi has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s government for being soft on supporters of the Khalistan movement who reside in Canada. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada.\nIndia has been asking countries like Canada, Australia and the UK to take legal action against Sikh activists. India has particularly raised these concerns with Canada, where Sikhs make up nearly 2 percent of the country’s population.\nThe Indian foreign ministry said Monday that “India reserves the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau government’s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India.”\nThe ministry also summoned the top Canadian diplomat in New Delhi and told him that “the baseless targeting” of the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, and other diplomats and officials in Canada “was completely unacceptable.”\n“We have no faith in the current Canadian government’s commitment to ensure their security,” it said.\nStewart Wheeler, the Canadian diplomat who was directed to leave India, told reporters after being summoned that his government has shared “incredible and irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.”\nWheeler said India must investigate the allegations and that Canada “stands ready to cooperate with India.”\nMeanwhile, the US State Department said in a statement Monday that an Indian enquiry committee set up to investigate a plot to assassinate another prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York would be traveling to Washington on Tuesday as part of their ongoing investigations to discuss the case.\n“Additionally, India has informed the United States they are continuing their efforts to investigate other linkages of the former government employee and will determine follow-up steps, as necessary,” it said.\nLast year, U,S, prosecutors said that an Indian government official directed the plot to assassinate Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil and announced charges against a man they said was part of the thwarted conspiracy.\nThe Indian government official was niether charged nor identified by name, but was described as a “senior field officer” with responsibilities in security management and intelligence, said to have previously served in India’s Central Reserve Police Force.\nNew Delhi at that time had expressed concern after the US raised the issue, and said India takes it seriously.', 'NEW YORK: About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel’s war in Gaza were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, police said.\nThe protesters chanted “Let Gaza live!” and “Up up with liberation, down down with occupation!” in front of the stock exchange’s landmark building in lower Manhattan.\n“The reason we’re here is to demand that the US government stop sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration. “Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using US bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices skyrocket.”\nA handful of counterprotesters waved Israeli flags and tried to shout down the pro-Palestinian chants.\nNone of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they sat down and waited to be taken into custody.\nA spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the protest.\nPolice arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers.\nA police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not have details on the charges they faced.\nThe protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and beyond.\nThe Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military and it was not clear what the target was.', 'NEW DELHI: India and Canada each expelled the other’s ambassador and five other top diplomats, after New Delhi said its envoy had been named among “persons of interest” following the killing of a Sikh separatist leader.\nNew Delhi said it was withdrawing its six diplomats from Canada, but an Ottawa government source told AFP they had been expelled, not withdrawn.\nThe 2023 murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar crashed the country’s diplomatic relations with India after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” linking Indian intelligence services to the crime.\nThe expulsion of the diplomats — the most senior envoys on both sides — is a major escalation in the row.\nIndia “decided to expel” Ottawa’s acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler, his deputy and four first secretaries, ordering they leave before midnight on Sunday.\nOttawa announced similar measures in return, with Canadian police saying they had “evidence pertaining to agents of the government of India’s involvement in serious criminal activity” in Canada.\nNijjar — who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015 — had advocated for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, carved out of India.\nHe had been wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism and conspiracy to commit murder.\nFour Indian nationals have been arrested in connection with Nijjar’s murder, which took place in the parking lot of a Sikh temple in Vancouver in June 2023.\nNew Delhi had earlier said it had “received a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are persons of interest” in the ongoing investigation.\nIt said their envoy, Sanjay Kumar Verma, a former ambassador to Japan and Sudan, was a respected career diplomat and that the accusations were “ludicrous.”\nNew Delhi’s foreign ministry said it had told Verma to return home.\n“We have no faith in the current Canadian Government’s commitment to ensure their security,” it said in a statement.\nIndia on Monday called allegations it was connected to the killing “preposterous” and a “strategy of smearing India for political gains.”\nLast year, the Indian government briefly curbed visas for Canadians and forced Ottawa to withdraw diplomats, and on Monday threatened further action.\n“India reserves the right to take further steps in response to the Trudeau Government’s support for extremism, violence and separatism against India,” the foreign ministry said.\nThe foreign ministry also summoned Canadian envoy Wheeler, who said that Ottawa had given India the evidence it had demanded.\n“Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil,” Wheeler told reporters after leaving the ministry.\n“Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into all those allegations. It is in the interest of both our countries and the peoples of our countries to get to the bottom of this. Canada stands ready to cooperate with India.”\nIndia then announced his expulsion.\nCanada is home to around 770,000 Sikhs, who make up about two percent of the country’s population, with a vocal minority calling for an independent state of Khalistan.\nIn November 2023, the US Justice Department also charged an Indian citizen living in the Czech Republic with allegedly plotting a similar assassination attempt on US soil.\nProsecutors said in unsealed court documents that an Indian government official was also involved in the planning of that attempt.', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have also floundered.', 'As with Gaza, US officials say Israel was initially planning for a much larger ground incursion into Lebanon before the US convinced it to scale back. But they also acknowledge what they have learned over the last year, which is that the US’ influence is limited when it comes to Israel’s military operations.', '“We couldn’t stop them from taking action, but we can at least try to shape what it looks like,” one senior US official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.', 'The ceasefire proposal, which the US put forward with France, had called for a 21-day pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah to give the sides space to work on a larger deal to return Israeli and Lebanese civilians to their homes in northern Israel and southern Lebanon.', '“We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah’s infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah’s capability, but we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday. “And ultimately, that’s not the outcome that we want to see.”', 'Senior US officials have also acknowledged that the US has limited leverage over what Israel decides to do against Iran following Tehran’s missile attack last week.', 'The US has been urging Israel not to be overly escalatory with a retaliatory strike, the official said. But they cautioned that what Israel sees as a proportional attack may not be in line with what the rest of the world — including the US — would consider to be a measured response.', 'President Joe Biden said last week that he would not support Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities, but it is not clear whether the US has successfully persuaded Israel to take that option off the table.', '“The only leverage that the Americans have right now is summoning the defense minister to Washington and buying time,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN.', 'Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is scheduled to meet with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday, a visit the Biden administration may hope buys time for consultations and planning before Israel carries out its promised retaliation against Iran. With Gallant in Washington, Pinkas says the US likely believes Israel will wait to attack.', '“This would make sense in a political science simulation game, not in Israeli politics,” Pinkas said.', 'Netanyahu was in New York when Israel carried out the massive strike in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. An attack against Iran, though far more complicated than striking a neighboring country, could still be carried out with the defense minister abroad, Pinkas said, especially given the acrimonious relationship between Netanyahu and Gallant.', 'Gallant said Israel is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but Israel will ultimately make its own decision about how it retaliates.', '“Everything is on the table,” Gallant told CNN on Sunday.', 'The US still wants to see Lebanon ceasefire talks resume, officials said, and US officials continue to believe that the conflict can only be resolved diplomatically.', '“We’re going to be having regular consultations with the Israelis, with the Lebanese and others, regarding the right moment to press for such an agreement,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.', 'But “the Israelis have to get beyond some things before we can revisit those conversations,” said one senior administration official.', 'That official and another source said it is not even clear at this point who the US would be dealing with on any ceasefire talks. Nasrallah and other members of Hezbollah’s senior leadership are now dead as a result of Israel’s operations in Lebanon. And while one US official expressed hope that the Lebanese government could now exert more control over the militant group, the Lebanese state is experiencing a similar power vacuum, having been without a president or fully empowered Cabinet since October 2022.', 'Austin said Friday that he believes the Lebanese government has an important opportunity to demonstrate “that it wants to care for its people” and siphon support away from Hezbollah, particularly now that the group’s chain of command “has really been stripped away at the strategic and operational level.”', 'But Israel’s punishing air campaign in Beirut could make it harder for a functioning Lebanese government to emerge from the rubble, one of the officials noted.', '“What’s going on in Beirut is not what we had wanted,” he said.', 'Austin and other senior members of Biden’s national security team – including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines – convened in the Oval Office on September 30 for several hours, discussing Israel’s intensifying operations in Lebanon. Earlier in the day, a reluctant Biden told reporters he’d be “comfortable with [Israel] stopping” the campaign in Lebanon that risked further inflaming the region. Behind closed doors, sources say, Biden offered reluctant support for eliminating Hezbollah infrastructure along Israel’s border and in southern Lebanon, as long as Israel’s operations remained limited in nature.', 'While the US has been generally supportive of that strategy, several officials including Austin have voiced concerns to Israel about mitigating civilian harm in its airstrikes —particularly in southern Beirut, a densely populated area where several residential buildings have been flattened in recent weeks.', '“The secretary has been very clear about the importance of taking civilian safety into account when planning and conducting operations, and that hasn’t changed,” Maj.

Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday when asked whether he supports Israel’s operations in Beirut. “That continues to be a topic of discussion between [Austin] and Minister Gallant.”', 'Israel says it is working to mitigate civilian casualties, noting that it has issued evacuation notices to Lebanese residents in recent days before conducting operations.

These efforts, albeit constructive, are raising questions on the timing, with Hezbollah—the Lebanese political and military group with overpowering influence in the country—facing massive blows as it fights against the Israeli invasion."", ""Last week, reports emerged that acting premier Najeeb Mikati, speaker Nabeeh Berri and former head of the Socialist Party Walid Jumbalat have been holding talks to ultimately bring an end to the conflict in Lebanon that has killed over 2,000 people and displaced more than 1.2 million others. To negotiate a ceasefire with Israel, the initiative includes discussions on deploying the national army to southern Lebanon with full mandate as part of a UN decree passed at the end of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006 but not fully implemented, and electing a president to fill a post that has been vacant for two years. "", 'The drive to elect a president comes after the assassination of top leaders in Hezbollah, which has previously vetoed several presidential candidates it deemed intolerant to its influence in the country. It also comes as facilities and services in the cash-strapped country struggle to accommodate the exodus of internally-displaced people and attend to thousands wounded by Israeli shelling.', ""The initiative is also seen as a push against Washington's pressures to capitalise on Hezbollah's vulnerability following these assassinations, including that of its general secretary Hassan Nasrallah. On Thursday, while in a meeting with Lebanese acting foreign minister Abdullah Bou Habib, the State Department's top Middle East diplomat Barbara Leaf was quoted by the Lebanese official news agency as stressing the urgency of electing a president."", 'Saleh Hadifa, the media commissioner of the Socialist Party that is part of the talks, dismissed that foreign intervention is relevant. ""This attempt stems from our national responsibility to exit the prolonged internal crises. This requires responses from all local parties, particularly the issue of the presidency, since it is necessary—at the time being— to fortify state institutions and have a president of the republic and a government capable of assuming executive authority with full powers,"" Hadifa said. ', ""Previous attempts over the last two years to reach consensus over a president have failed, largely because Lebanon's kaleidoscope of political and sectarian parties failed to reach consensus on a presidential candidate."", 'In Lebanon, where top political posts are filled based on power-sharing among the various religious sects, the post of the president must be filled by a Christian. ', 'Noting that Hezbollah has delegated Berri, it\'s strongest ally, to represent the group in the talks, Hadifa told The New Arab that the ""positive atmosphere"" following the first rounds of talks need ""to be translated into positive steps, to elect a consensus president who unites the Lebanese around him to be able to continue negotiating for reaching a ceasefire and implementing Resolution 1701 from both sides.""', 'As for the timing of this push in the midst of the most intense violence on Lebanon since 2006, Hadifa said, ""If it is not at this time, when will it be? At this dangerous stage, the initiative aims to preserve the state of Lebanon.""', 'Meanwhile, journalist Mounir al-Rabei who is well-informed of the talks, said the group\'s lawmakers won\'t be able to attend any meetings for their safety, and therefore a parliamentary vote on presidential candidates before a ceasefire is out of the question.\n\n""We can therefore declare these efforts futile,"" he stated.', '""US politicians have doubled down their threats to Mikati which triggered this drive to elect a new president,"" explained al-Rabei, who said that both Jumbalat and Berri detected the foreign and domestic attempts to impose a ""new reality"" in Lebanon, ""especially since parties resentful of Hezbollah are betting on this war to weaken the group, and usher in a new reality.""', '', 'According to local press, the US has been pushing for the election of Joseph Aoun, commander in chief of the Lebanese army, as the president, which Hezbollah and Berri oppose. This, al-Rabei said, prompted Berri, Jumblat and Mikati to convene and unanimously voice their rejection to the ""imposing of a president on the Lebanese people without a consensus.""', '""The Israelis aim to repeat what happened in 1982 and 1983, when their invasion of Lebanon imposed implications which then influenced the presidential elections at the time. But the political and military situation are very different in Lebanon today,"" concluded al-Rabei, alluding to the civil war that engulfed Lebanon at the time, and the subsequent invasion.', 'On his part, researcher and political writer George Al-Aqouri said electing a president today is a must, regardless of foreign intervention. ""The situation in Lebanon is worsening daily with the intensification of the war, and the official responsibility lies with Berri and Mikati, who are seeking a president to lift much of that burden, especially since he is the supreme head of the armed forces and authorized to conclude international agreements,"" he explained.', 'However, Al-Aqouri believes that if there was seriousness in the new proposal to elect a president, Berri would have convened the parliament to elect a president.

But there is a broad group of Lebanese who do not support Hezbollah\'s unilateral decision of war on the southern frontline on October 8, 2023,"" he said, adding that US mediator Amos Hochstein\'s pre-war efforts to resolve Lebanese-Israeli maritime disputes indicate that American influence has been ongoing for a long time, and that Hezbollah has been indirectly involved in it.', '""The question therefore is: does Hezbollah see an urgent need for a president to bear the consequences of what the party has committed, or whether it considers the absence of a president to be less burdensome and facilitates its movement?"" wondered Al-Aqouri.', 'This piece was published in collaboration with Egab.', '', '', '', '', '']"
What’s With Biden’s Schizophrenia on Lebanon?,https://www.commentary.org/seth-mandel/whats-with-bidens-schizophrenia-on-lebanon/,"['', '', 'The monthly magazine of opinion.', 'I’m getting whiplash trying to follow the waning days of the Biden administration’s Mideast diplomacy. For months we heard nothing but “de-escalation.” Now, suddenly, instead of telling Israel to stay out of Lebanon, Team Biden has a new idea: Everyone into the pool!', '“Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in recent days to ask them to support the election of a new Lebanese president,” reports the Wall Street Journal. “Senior White House official Amos Hochstein has also told Arab officials that the weakening of Hezbollah by Israeli attacks should be viewed as an opportunity to potentially break a political impasse. The country’s political parties have been unable to agree on a new president since the previous leader, Michel Aoun, left office at the end of his term in 2022.”', 'The basic problem is this: Hezbollah and its allies have a large enough bloc in parliament that it effectively gives the Iranian proxy a veto over legislation. Hezbollah also controls the Beirut airport and holds South Lebanon in an iron grip. Hezbollah thus has a great deal of influence over the institutions of Lebanese government and has its own institutions, including an army, that operate independently of the state. What began as an Iranian outpost has been slowly molded over time into essentially a second Iranian state.', 'Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s attacks have been so insistent and provocative and threatening to Israel’s sovereignty that it has invited a military response serious enough to allow the world to imagine a post-Hezbollah Lebanon. Perhaps that possibility has convinced Team Biden to pull a 180.', 'There are two reasons for skepticism.', 'The first is related to the fact that we’re having this conversation at all: The administration proposing this fix is fickle, strategically erratic, and at the end of its term in office.', 'Is it good that Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the top figures at the National Security Council are willing to acknowledge that America and its allies have a keen interest in rolling back Iranian expansionism? Absolutely. But a week ago they were shouting for a ceasefire and demanding Israel reduce its list of Iranian retaliatory targets. Where will they be on this tomorrow?', 'Indeed, if there’s anything that characterizes this administration, it’s the attention span of a labradoodle puppy. Commitment and follow-through are foreign concepts.', 'President Biden was committed to Hamas’s defeat at the beginning of the war a year ago. Halfway through, his efforts became singularly focused on ending the hostilities in any way possible, leaving Yahya Sinwar untouched and consigning at least some of the hostages to permanent captivity.', 'The original plan was to rebuild Gaza after removing Hamas from the strip. That required putting together a regional coalition willing to stick its neck out and plunk down ungodly amounts of money while taking at least some responsibility for management of Gaza during a dangerous and chaotic transition period. The flaking-out of the Biden administration didn’t just give Sinwar a new lease on life; it put our Sunni allies out on a limb and then cut that limb down.', 'The amount of commitment it would take to “fix” Lebanon would dwarf Gaza reconstruction. This is the second problem with the administration’s new grand idea. In four weeks, America will elect Biden’s successor. That person, whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, will replace the Cabinet with their own. Harris’s national-security team is dominated by those who want the U.S. less, not more, entangled in the politics of the Middle East. Which is to say, Joe Biden’s chosen successor would shred Biden’s plan on her first day in office.', 'Without a commitment from the U.S., there won’t be a commitment from anyone else. Our allies have already been burned by Biden’s about-face on Gaza.', 'All of this reveals the wasted potential of U.S. policy in the Mideast. The Obama-Biden administration’s coddling of Iran enabled the Gaza and Lebanon crises to reach this point. Four years later, Donald Trump handed Biden and Harris the Abraham Accords and an ongoing set of negotiations with Saudi Arabia, which they promptly shoved in a drawer so they could try to revive a policy that privileged Iran. When that went nowhere, the fickle crew went back to Saudi Arabia, too late to secure an agreement.', 'Now they want an Iranian proxy to remain in Gaza but an international coalition to push out an Iranian proxy in Lebanon?', 'Their hearts are in the right place—for now. But they have mortgaged the American credibility that would be needed to follow this path. Such are the wages of indecision and strategic caprice.
