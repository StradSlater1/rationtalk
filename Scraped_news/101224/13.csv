Anger and disgust in Mexico over beheading of newly sworn-in city mayor,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/mexico-murder-beheading-city-mayor-alejandro-arcos-catalan-chilpancingo,"['Country’s new president to set out public security plans after murder of Alejandro Arcos Catalán in Chilpancingo', 'Mexico’s new government has been shaken by the murder of a city mayor who was attacked and beheaded days after taking office.', 'Alejandro Arcos Catalán was sworn in as the mayor of Chilpancingo, the capital of the southern state of Guerrero, on 30 September, a day before Mexico’s first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, took power herself.', 'On Monday, less than a week into her presidency, Sheinbaum confirmed reports that the 43-year-old city leader had been slain the previous day, telling reporters: “All the necessary investigations are taking place.”', 'Photographs of Arcos Catalán’s bloodied head, exhibited on the roof of a white vehicle while his body lay slumped inside, spread on social media – a terrible reminder of the violence that Mexico’s organised crime conflict has inflicted on the Latin American country.', 'The mayor’s murder came after two close allies were shot dead in the early days of his short-lived administration. A secretary, Francisco Tapia, was gunned down on 3 October, while Ulises Hernández Martínez, a former special forces police commander who was tipped to become Arcos Catalán’s security chief, was riddled with bullets on the eve of the mayor’s inauguration.', 'Shocked citizens shared footage of an interview with the mayor before his death in which he said he wished to be remembered as a champion of peace and happiness. “I’ve lived here all my life … and it’s here that I want to die – but I want to die fighting for my city,” Arcos Catalán said.', 'The murder sparked anger and disgust, with Alejandro Moreno, the president of Arcos Catalán’s party, the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), denouncing what he called a grotesque “act of terror”.', 'Ricardo Anaya, an opposition senator, lamented the “spine-chilling” security situation in Mexico, where more than 450,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderón launched his doomed “war” against the drug cartels in 2006.', '“The fact that they have decapitated the mayor of such an important city should make us shudder. It is utterly unacceptable and we need to do something to ensure it stops happening,” Anaya told reporters, calling for an immediate change in tack in security policy.', 'But Sheinbaum has promised to continue the so-called “hugs, not bullets” security policy of her predecessor and mentor, the 70-year-old nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, during her six-year term.', '“We will not return to Calderón’s reckless war on the narcos that did our country so much harm. It remains our conviction that security and peace are the fruits of justice,” she told thousands of supporters who packed Mexico City’s Zócalo Square for her historic inauguration last Tuesday.', 'Although López Obrador claimed to have achieved a modest reduction in Mexico’s murder rate in the later stages of his presidency, there is consensus among security analysts that his attempts to “pacify” the country failed. Last year Mexico suffered more than 30,000 murders. According to the Instituto Igarapé thinktank, Mexico was home to 11 of the world’s 50 most murderous cities in 2023, compared with three in 2015. Chilpancingo was one of them.', 'Despite that bleak reality, López Obrador, who most Mexicans know simply as Amlo, left office with approval ratings of 70%, largely as a result of his relentless focus on fighting inequality and positioning himself as a champion of the poor.', 'Aware that tackling violence represents one of her most daunting challenges – and under pressure after Arcos Catalán’s murder – Sheinbaum said she would set out her public security plans on Tuesday.', 'Another major security crisis is playing out in the north-western city of Culiacán, where an internal conflict within the Sinaloa cartel triggered by the capture of its co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García has led to scores of killings.', 'Sheinbaum’s security drive will be spearheaded by the security minister, Omar García Harfuch, who served as her police chief while she was mayor of Mexico City. García Harfuch has first-hand experience of the dangers of organised crime: in 2020 he came close to death when hitmen ambushed his car on the capital’s best-known street, firing more than 400 times with assault rifles and grenade launchers.', 'The identity of the killers of the mayor of Chilpancingo remained unclear but in recent years the city has witnessed a bloody squabble between two criminal groups called Los Ardillos (the Squirrels) and Los Tlacos. As often happens in Mexico, local politicians have been implicated in that underworld. Arcos Catalán’s predecessor Norma Otilia Hernández was removed from office after compromising footage emerged showing her talking with a Squirrels boss in a restaurant. Hernández, who was then a member of López Obrador and Sheinbaum’s political movement, Morena, claimed it was a “chance” encounter, but was later expelled from the party.', 'After his election earlier this year, Arcos Catalán reportedly said he would not do deals or negotiate with criminal groups.']"

India’s capital markets have boomed so far this year, with IPO proceeds already surpassing last year’s total.', '“The stars are aligned in many respects,” a top Indian investment banker said, though analysts have warned about a bubble and predict the IPO craze will eventually die down.', 'Carbon targets and cheap Chinese competition are forcing European carmakers to brace for an “EV winter.” All but one of the biggest EU-based auto firms announced profit warnings recently, a situation likely to get worse as EU targets demand the industry cuts emissions or face fines next year, which one manufacturer said would add 40% to the cost. Chinese models, some as cheap as $22,000, are squeezing the market too.', 'In an attempt to keep up, European firms will launch around 170 new EV models in the next two years, analysts told the Financial Times, but face struggles: Consumers know EV tech is improving and are putting off purchases, and if there is a price war, “I’m not sure the Europeans are [in] the best place to win it.”', 'China conducted large-scale military exercises around Taiwan on Monday, a move that came in response to what Beijing called “separatist acts” by Taipei.', 'Chinese state media said the drills were retaliation for a speech last week in which Taiwanese President William Lai vowed to “resist annexation or encroachment” from Beijing. Heightened tensions along the Taiwan Strait — through which more than a fifth of global maritime trade passes — could be devastating for the world economy.', '“In the event of a long conflict over Taiwan,” an expert at the Stimson Center wrote, “financial markets would tank, trade would shrivel, and supply chains would freeze, plunging the global economy into a tailspin.”', 'Three US-based academics won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday for their research into inequality between nations.', 'Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, from the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, and James Robinson from the University of Chicago shared the award, the last of this year’s prizes.', '”Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time’s greatest challenges.

Israel on Sunday called on the United Nations to evacuate its peacekeeping units and allegedly using tanks to burst through the gates of a peacekeeper base.', 'Days earlier, Israeli forces injured several UN peacekeepers, drawing international criticism. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been a vocal supporter of Israel, spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and denounced the attacks.', 'The push marks the latest escalation in Israel’s onslaught against Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group and one of the most powerful political parties in Lebanon — despite its losses, Hezbollah is “falsely presenting Israeli ground operations as a failure in order to degrade Israeli will and underscore Hezbollah’s own resilience,” the Institute of War said in a recent report.', 'Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister pushed back on the idea Iran might not respond to an expected Israeli attack in retaliation for Tehran’s Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, warning that there are “no red lines” for such a defense and that Iran is prepared for a “war situation.”', 'The US Department of Defense authorized the deployment of a weapons system to support Israel’s air defenses and troops Sunday, to bolster the “defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,” according to a Pentagon spokesperson.', 'Climate disasters have opened a new dimension in what remains an exceedingly close race ahead of the US presidential election.', 'Over the weekend, Vice President Kamala Harris visited an area of North Carolina hard-hit by Hurricane Helene — a trip that also included campaign events aimed at mobilizing Black voters in the crucial swing state.', 'Meanwhile at a Coachella, California rally Saturday, her Republican rival Donald Trump criticized the state’s water management practices, threatening to withhold “any of that fire money that we send you.” The remarks followed reports that, while president, Trump once refused to approve disaster aid for California until he learned that the affected area was home to many of his supporters.', 'The former president has criticized the government’s response to the recent hurricanes, while facing pushback over his own posture on federal disaster aid, as both campaigns seek to further distinguish their candidate’s record against the other.', 'Hundreds of Cubans have disappeared in recent years while attempting to reach the US via the Straits of Florida, one of the world’s most perilous migration routes. The UN says at least 626 have died along the crossing since 2014, Reuters reported.', 'The 90-mile route across the gap from Cuba to Florida is plagued by strong currents and violent weather patterns, but can also be significantly cheaper for Cuban migrants compared to a path through central America.', 'Cuba is undergoing a severe recession, which has led to 850,000 arriving in the US since 2022, and a national population depletion of 18%, according to El País.

In response to the EU’s recent vote to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese-made EVs, China has threatened retaliatory tariffs on European goods, including dairy, brandy, pork, and automobile parts.', 'Analysts say that there is a limit to China’s ability to strike back, however. Luxury goods from Europe are unlikely to face tariffs, since they generate higher tax revenues, and anything that might put off increasingly thrifty Chinese consumers from spending money may be “the opposite of what the government wants.”', 'Partial remains of Sandy Irvine, perhaps one of the first men to climb Mount Everest, have likely been discovered on the mountain, National Geographic reported.', 'The find comes 25 years after his climbing partner George Mallory’s frozen body was also discovered on the Himalayan peak.

Many analysts noted that details on the size of the country’s proposed fiscal stimulus plan were “notably missing” during a Saturday press conference with China’s finance minister on the new data.', 'Some financial experts believe China “will deliver” on the details when the country’s top legislative committee reconvenes later this month, The Wall Street Journal reported.', 'Transparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.', 'Sign up for Semafor Flagship']"
