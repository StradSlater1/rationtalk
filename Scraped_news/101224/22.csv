Tesla Cybercab to debut in 2026,https://www.electrive.com/2024/10/11/tesla-cybercab-to-debut-in-2026/,"['In Los Angeles, Tesla unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi - or two of them. In addition to a coupé with gullwing doors, Elon Musk also presented an autonomous van for 20 passengers. The Cybercab is expected to launch in 2026 - even if Musk himself expresses slight doubts about this.', 'The event at Warners Bros studios started almost an hour late, allegedly due to a medical emergency in the audience. When Tesla CEO Elon Musk pulled up in a driverless Cybercab without a steering wheel, there was great astonishment – mainly due to the vehicle’s appearance. After all, no authorisation was required to drive a car without a steering wheel on private property. As the film studio is modelled on a real environment, Musk could still demonstrate the capabilities of the autonomous driving system.', 'The Cybercab is an aerodynamically shaped coupé with gullwing doors – critics see a certain resemblance to the VW XL1. The Cybercab does prove that the basic rules of aerodynamics are the same for everyone.\nIf a car is to be aerodynamic, there is no way around this particular shape. The stainless steel body (here with a touch of gold) and continuous light strip at the front are reminiscent of the Cybertruck, even if – for aerodynamic reasons – the car is not as sharp-edged as the pickup.', 'Tesla is still keeping quiet about the Cybercab’s platform and drive technology for the premiere – there is currently no detailed information on the Tesla website either. However, Musk has announced that private customers will be able to buy the self-driving car for less than 30,000 dollars – a price limit many car manufacturers fail to achieve with significantly more conventional electric cars. Even the cheapest Tesla currently costs over 40,000 dollars in the US after the carmaker took the Model 3 with the small LFP battery off the market (due to the tariffs on the battery imported from China).', 'Unlike the Model 3, the Cybercab is only a two-seater. The hinged doors give access to a rather small interior, with a solid partition wall behind the two seats. Tesla has thus also eliminated a rear window. Nevertheless, there is a surprisingly large boot under the golden cover.', 'Tesla plans to start production in 2026 – at least according to Musk. However, he did add that he tends to be quite optimistic with timetables. So it remains to be seen whether the model will really be on the market in two years’ time. To take the most blatant example: Musk showed the second generation of the Tesla Roadster in November 2017 and announced production for 2020 – but the vehicle is still not available today.', 'Until the actual premiere of the Cybercab (Musk also mentioned the year 2027), Tesla wants to further develop the autonomous driving system in the Model 3 and Model Y. The Model 3 and Model Y are expected to be able to drive autonomously in California and Texas by the end of next year, depending on regulatory approvals – after which the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X will also follow. The Cybercab thus appears to use a comparable system – i.e. purely camera-based. Elon Musk has rejected expensive lidar sensors several times in the past and is sticking to his guns for the Cybercab.', 'Tesla promises that the Cybercabs will also be particularly cheap to operate. At the event, Musk said that the Cybercab would cost around 20 cents per mile, whereas an average bus journey in the US would cost around one dollar per mile – in other words, five times as much. Of course, this cannot be verified at present.', 'In addition to the car-like Cybercab, Tesla has also presented the Robovan – an incredibly futuristic interpretation of a medium-sized electric bus. The presentation of the Cybercab as Tesla’s long-announced robotaxi was clearly at the centre of the ‘We, Robot’ event. Although Musk has already written about autonomous buses and shuttles in one of his master plans, a Telsa bus has since taken a back seat. InsideEVs also writes that the Robovan “was a surprise last-minute addition.”', 'The fact that there is currently no data on the drive system, autonomous driving system or release date also speaks in favour of the “last-minute addition,” and Tesla has so far remained silent on the price. There have already been plenty of autonomous minibus studies in the past, which can be used as a large-capacity taxi, goods transporter or for other purposes with interchangeable modules. Tesla also presented a kind of food truck as a rolling diner in addition to the passenger transporter.', 'So, let’s look at the known facts: Without a driver who needs a clear view of the road in front, the Robovan no longer has a windscreen. Golden elements and glass surfaces on the sides dominate its exterior. The wheels are located on the inside under the golden panelling, which gives the Robovan the appearance of a train hovering a few centimetres above the road. The sliding glass doors on the sides provide access to the interior or food truck sales stand.', 'Although the premiere date is not yet known, Musk indicates that the vehicle is coming and will look like it. “One of the things that we want to do, and you’ve seen this with the Cybertruck, is we want to change the look of the roads,” Musk said of the Robovan. “The future should look like the future.”', 'What is almost more surprising about the double premiere than the design of the new Teslas is the massive criticism voiced in the US media immediately after the event. InsideEVs emphasises that Tesla failed to meet the announced market launch date and the promised base prices: “The Cybertruck was supposed to cost under $50,000 but now starts at $80,000.”', 'Electrek also criticises Tesla for promising autonomous driving for many years. “The only data available shows that Tesla needs a roughly 500-100x improvement in miles between disengagement before it can make this a reality, and it only was able to do a ~2x improvement so far this year,” it says.', 'Numerous experts have criticised the reliance on cameras alone for autonomous driving. Waymo also uses radar and lidar systems but can already record 100,000 autonomous journeys per week in four US cities.', 'One Electrek reader is annoyed that the Cybercab only has two seats (and a large boot): “They couldn’t make it seat at least 4? Vehicle takes up as much room on the road as a regular car and it only seats two… seems like a massive fail to me.”', 'insideevs.com, electrek.co (Cybercab), insideevs.com, electrek.co, theverge.com (Robovan)', 'Your email address will not be published.

"Tesla's Robotaxi Event: Mostly Fluff, Except for One Interesting Technical Detail",https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/teslas-robotaxi-event-mostly-fluff-except-for-one-interesting-technical,"[""Tesla teased two autonomous vehicles at its 'We, Robot' event last night, but the star of the show was the technology that will power them."", ""Tesla's much-hyped robotaxi debut was a master class in dressing up vaporware, save for one tiny mention of a product that is already on its way to a garage near you: wireless EV charging."", 'The two autonomous vehicles that headlined the event, the Cybercab and Robovan, will not have a charge port. Instead, they will power up by driving over a small pad, which beams electricity to the battery through an invisible magnetic field.', '""That\'s kind of how it should be,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a splashy launch event in Los Angeles last night. ""It\'s really high time we did this.""', ""For the first time, Musk has made wireless charging—or inductive charging, as he referred to it—a core tenet of Tesla's future vehicles. That means no need to wrestle with an ugly, thick cord and heave it into the port. It's a nice-to-have convenience for today's EVs, but it will be a must-have for autonomous vehicles that lack a driver to do the heavy lifting."", 'Tesla could decouple the release of wireless charging pads from fully autonomous vehicles and offer it for its current lineup. It may need to, given the steep regulatory hurdles facing its robotaxis. Musk suggested it could get clearance to operate driverless systems in California and Texas in 2025, something multiple other automakers already have, and start production in 2026 or 2027.', 'That said, Musk admitted last night that he\'s been too ""optimistic"" on timelines in the past. And on YouTube, the event video begins with a disclosure: ""Statements in this presentation are forward-looking statements...actual results may differ from those projected.""', 'Wireless charging pads have far fewer hurdles to get to market than robotaxis, and Tesla has the chops to make it happen. In 2023, it bought Wiferon, a German wireless charging company. It quickly re-sold it but kept the engineering talent, according to Not a Tesla App.', ""Earlier this year, Cybertruck owners discovered a mention of inductive charging equipment in the vehicle's manual, InsideEVs reports. It's possible this could be the new standard build for future vehicles to make them compatible with a yet-to-be-released wireless charging product. Rival automakers are prototyping their own solutions; we powered up a Ford Mustang Mach-E with a pad built by Witricity."", ""That's why even though the robotaxi event was not supposed to be about wireless charging, it's my main takeaway from it. The rest was fluff, and irked investors with its vague promises, The Wall Street Journal reports."", 'Musk made it clear his product roadmap is driven by the desire to bring sci-fi movies to life, ""the likes of which almost no one has envisioned."" (He seems to be taking a page from Donald Trump\'s rhetorical style.) He named the event ""We, Robot"" in a nod to the movie I, Robot, and rented out Warner Bros. Studios, where the Cybercab drove through various Hollywood-themed zones, like Westworld and Metropolis.', '""We have quite a show for you tonight, I think you\'re gonna like it,"" says Musk in his opening remarks, recalling his 2021 Saturday Night Live hosting gig. After showing a series of slides intended to convince the public that autonomous driving is worth the many years it will take to achieve it, he ended with, ""Let\'s party!"" as someone in the crowd shouted, ""We love you, Elon!""', 'Humanoid ""Teslabots"" kicked off the festivities, dancing in a gazebo like go-go dancers and pouring drinks at the bar. Attendees took a spin in the Cybercab on a tightly controlled driving course throughout the 30-acre movie set, their first taste of what will likely be a multi-year, perhaps multi-decade wait for the real thing.', ""Sign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning."", '', 'This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

"Tesla’s Cybercab / Robotaxi - Price, FSD Hardware, Release Date, Screen Size and More",https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/2314/teslas-cybercab-robotaxi-price-fsd-hardware-release-date-screen-size-and-more,"['October 10th was Tesla’s spectacular ‘We, Robot’ robotaxi event, and now we know a lot more about Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi – officially named the Cybercab – than ever before.', 'So, grab your Tesla-stamped BBQ burgers and put on your 12 gallon hat, we’re going to take a look at everything we know about Tesla’s Cybercab.', 'The Cybercab showed up to ‘We, Robot’ with both a front and rear lightbar, similar to the Cybertruck. However, unlike the truck – it’s not stainless steel. Instead, the prototypes that were at the robotaxi event arrived with aluminum body panels painted silver.', 'While the exterior finish won’t be as tough-as-nails as the Cybertruck, the Cybercab is designed to be cheaply mass-produced, so this decision makes sense. While there was early talk about using a stainless steel “exoskeleton,” it appears Tesla decided that aluminum and steel body panels would be easier and/or cheaper to manufacture.', 'While many initial concepts thought the Cybercab may only include three wheels, it does indeed have four wheels like a normal car.', 'And of those four, only the front two did the steering – so no rear-wheel steering here. Speaking of the wheels, they were mostly covered up with a disc-shaped plate, making them extremely aerodynamic. Tesla also painted the sidewalls of the tires silver, leaving them looking super slim in comparison to the size of the wheel.', 'Looking at the whole vehicle, the Cybercab doesn’t have Tesla’s iconic glass roof – but a simpler metal roof. The windows are not frameless either – they are framed (metal around the glass opening), which makes them easier to maintain and produce. All these changes are clearly aimed at reducing the overall cost of the vehicle, fitting its robotic taxi role.', 'The one oddball in terms of price-to-function ratio is the butterfly doors. Cybercab’s butterfly doors are super impressive – and strike a pose just as iconically as the Model X. We’re interested to see what Tesla has planned for these automatic doors – as they may be difficult to maintain and service in colder climates given snow and ice build-up.', 'On the interior, the Cybercab comfortably seats two adults with large, padded seats. In these prototype vehicles, the seats are not ventilated, but they are heated. The seats themselves were fairly simple in comparison to Tesla’s other seat designs, even when compared to the simpler Mexican Model 3 with its fabric seats.', 'Tesla has made the overall interior design very simplistic and easy to clean. They showed off a new automatic vacuum and scrubbing unit that was cleaning the robotaxi’s seats and screens – so these seats are likely intended to take some punishment. And the screen will likely need to be cleaned often. There were no other major controls in the vehicle to clean – no steering wheel, no pedals.', 'However, the interior is classic Tesla—super spartan, stylish, and clean, with an extremely large 20.5” center display intended to display trip progress and entertainment. In comparison, the Cybertruck currently has the largest display in any Tesla, with an 18.5” screen. The Model 3 and Model Y use a 15” screen. Unsurprisingly, it looked like both video games and movies and TV shows would be available in the Cybercab.', 'Two drink holders are also located just in front and below the center armrest. Just under the drink holders (towards the passengers) are the buttons to open and close the doors. The doors normally close automatically when the passenger(s) buckle up, but they can also be closed manually.', 'As expected, the controls for the windows are on the doors, so nothing too special there. Tesla has only shown the white interior so far, with black trim throughout the interior, including the carpet floor and plastic headliner. We’re hoping that Tesla also introduces a black interior – even with how resilient Tesla’s whites are – a black interior is likely to better last through the day-to-day punishment a taxi goes through.', 'At the event, Elon Musk confirmed that Cybercab would be shipping with an “upsized” Hardware 5/AI 5. It looks like AI5 has mostly the same camera layout as AI4—with two (+1 fake) cameras at the top of the windshield. The car also features a front bumper camera, the usual two B-pillar cameras, and one rear-facing camera.', 'Currently, the only vehicle with the same camera setup is the Cybertruck. We’ve heard rumors that the upcoming Model Y Juniper Refresh, as well as future Model S and Model X vehicles, will also have a front bumper camera.', ""The Cybercab's rear end has a fairly large amount of storage—the rear hatch opens upwards and reveals a sizeable cavity. From some rough estimates, it will be possible to comfortably throw 3-4 large suitcases back there, along with a few other items."", 'Internally, there’s less space, but as there is no center storage console, there is a large amount of legroom. If you potentially needed extra space, you could put a backpack on the floor of the Cybercab between your feet, and still have plenty of space to stretch.', 'Elon acknowledged he’s been overly optimistic about timelines and relented that production for Cybercab should begin no later than 2027. However, he did mention 2026 as a likely start date.', 'Now that the Cybercab has been unveiled, we’ll likely start seeing design and build prototypes on the roads in Texas and California – where Tesla plans to start Unsupervised FSD – sometime in late 2026. More vehicles will show up in 2027.', 'In a somewhat surprising move, Tesla announced that they’ll also sell the Cybercab to anyone who wants to buy it, whether it’s for personal use or to operate their own fleet of autonomous taxis. Tesla announced that they plan to sell the Cybercab for under $30,000 USD. Given the lack of steering wheel and pedals, we’re not sure whether the US Federal EV Rebate or the Canadian iZEV rebates would be applicable to these Cybercabs, but we’ll see how that pans out in the future. Both of these rebate programs are set to expire before the Cybercab hits the road.', 'Elon also confirmed that the Cybercab has inductive charging – a first for a fleet-scale EV. It seems that Cybercabs will likely belong to “hubs” where they can be charged and get cleaned. Whether these hubs are Tesla-owned facilities or consumer-owned is yet to be determined.', 'Tesla also showed off a very short clip of the Cybercab getting cleaned with robotic arms. The cost and complexity of this are likely to drive a model where Tesla provides the facilities for charging and cleaning while owners simply let their vehicles be charged or cleaned as required.', 'We’re excited to hear more details about how exactly Tesla intends to build out these potential hubs and more details about the upcoming Cybercab.

On October 10, 2024, he showcased the company\'s long-awaited Cybercab and surprised attendees with the reveal of a larger Robovan at a glitzy unveiling dubbed ""We, Robot"" at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, which was live-streamed on X.', 'After a nearly one-hour delay, Musk arrived in the fully autonomous two-door Cybercab prototype, stating that it will begin production in earnest by 2026 and with a price of less than $30,000. He then showed off a much larger Robovan that seats 20 and said the vehicle would reshape urban areas by ""turning parking lots into parks.""', 'Tesla Robovan', 'Tesla', 'Aside from that, the technological details of both vehicles—safety features, range, and system configurations—came up surprisingly short during the 20-minute presentation.', 'The news, or lack of it, made investors more skeptical than excited, and Tesla stocks plummeted on October 11. According to Yahoo Finance, Josh Beck, an analyst at Raymond James Financial, called the presentation ""vague"" and ""underwhelming,"" while Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital analyst, stated that Musk\'s vision ""was light on real numbers and timelines…these typically come at Tesla events.

Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.', 'If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk could have taken the stage at last night’s “We, Robot” event and put a lot of fears to rest.', 'He could have released comprehensive safety data for the company’s Full Self-Driving feature that showed real progress for the driver-assist feature, contradicting all the crowdsourced data that’s out there making FSD look truly awful.', 'He could have announced that the Cybercab, a sleek little two-seater with butterfly-wing doors, would be a geofenced, Level 4, fleet-owned vehicle, operating in a few select markets with impressive-looking margins.', 'He could have provided an ounce of detail about the Cybercab’s technology stack, including its sensors, vision system, and onboard processing power. And he could have shocked the industry and surprised many of his doubters by embracing lidar, the laser sensor that serves as a crucial redundant system for every other driverless vehicle on Earth.', 'But he did none of those things. Instead, he put on what arguably looked like a great show, complete with fake movie posters, a ton of delicious-looking food, and robot bartenders.

Many times.', '“Prototype hardware that works in a limited demo is cool, interesting, and fine to comment on,” Phil Koopman, an AV expert from Carnegie Mellon, wrote in his newsletter this morning. “But it is not production, and hardware is not the limit to autonomous vehicles.

There were plenty of Tesla fans who were thoroughly impressed by what they saw last night and ready to declare that it was “game over” for every other player in the field. The Robovan wowed many with its Art Deco styling. And positive vibes extended to the company’s most bullish investors, some of whom participated in Musk’s theme park experience and came away forever altered.', 'Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who was in attendance, dismissed any stock decline in the aftermath of the event — Tesla was trading down by nearly 9 points in early trading Friday — as a “knee-jerk reaction” that would eventually correct itself. “We strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment,” he wrote Friday, “as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.”', 'It appears to be lost on some people how much things have changed since 2016, when Musk first promised that Full Self-Driving was a mere “two years away.” Many seem to be stuck in that outdated mindset that autonomous driving was an easy problem to solve and that fully driverless cars were on the cusp of taking over the world.', 'Since then, interest rates have skyrocketed, the buckets of ample venture capital funding have dried up, and most of the major players working on this technology have since reconfigured their timelines to account for how long it will take for self-driving cars to prove they can be safer than humans. Even Waymo, which is far and away the leader in the space, is taking things real slowly, one city at a time. It can’t promise the world; the company is still trying to figure out highways.', 'Musk is promising the opposite. He said that Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026. Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with “unsupervised” Full Self-Driving would come first. But he promised that people could even buy the Cybercab for a price “less than $30,000.” Potential owners would be like shepherds, tending their flock of little driverless cabs, roaming the streetscape.', 'Last night, his pitch veered utopian, as images of parking lots transformed into verdant gardens displayed on the giant screens above him.

We got no details about how he will overcome the enormous obstacles in his path. Here’s a quick rundown of some of the issues that went unresolved:', 'This is just scratching the surface', 'This is just scratching the surface.

We’ve already seen the kinds of death and destruction that have resulted from his company’s aggressive push into autonomous technology.

Tesla is hosting an event it\'s calling ""We, Robot"" in Hollywood on Thursday night.', 'An idiosyncratic billionaire takes to the stage (with, perhaps, a humanoid robot by his side?) to unveil a futuristic technology that he promises will transform the world — a vision alternately celebrated, mocked and feared.', 'It’s a scene straight out of Hollywood. And that’s exactly where it’s going to happen tonight — on a Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, California.', 'Tesla is calling the event “We, Robot.” At 7 p.m. Pacific time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to unveil the company’s design for a dedicated robotaxi, a Tesla designed exclusively to ferry passengers without a driver — a feat the company’s semi-autonomous software has not yet demonstrated it can do.', '“The future will be streamed live,” the company posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns.', 'Here are 5 things to know about Tesla’s big bet on autonomous driving.', 'Tesla makes money selling electric vehicles — in fact, its profit margins on its cars, which are consistently in the double digits, are enviable for an automaker. But Musk has his eye on the much fatter profit margins of the software industry.', 'In addition to selling cars, Tesla sells an expensive software package called “Full Self Driving (Supervised).” It can autonomously direct a Tesla on a wide range of roads, and navigate stoplights, stop signs and pedestrians without human input … most of the time. But it periodically requires a human to take over, which means it’s not truly autonomous.', 'Musk has always maintained that demand for the software will be much higher when it is fully autonomous — in part because that would allow people to make money off their personal vehicles by lending them out, like a driverless Uber or Lyft.', ""“The value of a fully electric autonomous fleet is generally gigantic — boggles the mind, really.” he told investors in 2021. “That will be one of the most valuable things that's ever done in the history of civilization.”"", 'A custom-built vehicle just for robotaxi rides is a relatively new twist on Musk’s vision. Expect to hear more about it on Thursday.', 'Musk’s become infamous for his overly enthusiastic estimates of how soon Tesla robotaxis will arrive. He’s even taken to poking fun at himself for all the times he’s been wrong.', 'The problem is that while Tesla’s software can drive a vehicle without human help much of the time, it’s not yet reliable enough to drive unassisted all of the time.', 'Companies like Alphabet’s Waymo and GM’s Cruise, meanwhile, have already sent driverless taxis onto streets — although Cruise put human “safety drivers” back behind the wheel after a crash last year. The systems often have someone on call to assist remotely if a car gets stuck. But that’s a far cry from needing constant oversight: According to data it supplied the state of California, Waymo drove nearly 1.2 million fully driverless miles last year with a total of 14 “disengagements,” or times the software required manual control.', 'Even for those companies, robotaxis aren’t profitable yet. The auto market research giant J.D. Power recently surveyed people who have ridden in robotaxis and found that while passengers generally liked the experience, they don’t find the taxis practical. Until they’re cheaper and cover more ground, the pollsters concluded, “the service will remain a novelty transportation method.”', 'So if robotaxis already exist, why doesn’t Tesla have this tech yet? There’s a big difference between how other companies — like Waymo, Cruise, the driverless trucking company Aurora and a host of startups — approach autonomy, and how Tesla is trying to do it.', 'Musk decided to build a system based only on relatively cheap cameras, with no other inputs; other companies also use radar and other pricey high-tech sensors. Musk also has embraced “end-to-end learning,” where the artificial intelligence “learns” how to drive from raw data; other companies add human-designed rules and guardrails to their AI systems.', 'Analyst George Gianarikas of Canaccord Genuity Group notes that Musk’s approach requires billions of dollars of upfront investment in AI, but much cheaper hardware on vehicles. That’s a combination that is expensive now, but would pay off if there were, say, millions of robotaxis on the road.', 'Musk is adamant that Tesla’s approach is superior. “Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets” — that is, human brains — “and eyes, so naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution,” Musk told investors earlier this year. Tesla also has enormous amounts of driving data from its vehicles on the road today.', 'Other companies say this approach is not just wrong but dangerous. Aurora took the unusual step of preemptively emailing reporters ahead of Tesla’s event this week to share bullet points about exactly what they object to. Those included concerns about making sure a system is learning good driving behaviors — not bad ones, like running stop signs — and that there are systems of checks and balances.', 'Aurora\'s email paraphrases points CPO Sterling Anderson made in a recent webcast: the approach favored by Tesla, the summary notes, is a "" \'train and pray\' approach where you fix a problem by throwing more data at the system – we find this to be problematic in a safety critical industry where you need confidence and proof you’ve actually fixed.""', 'Anderson used to work at Tesla, where he helped launch Tesla’s Autopilot software, its first partial-automation system, the Aurora email notes. Waymo just snagged a former Tesla exec for its team, too.', 'The United States still has no federal laws governing self-driving, so a patchwork of state and city regulators set the boundaries of what companies can and cannot do.', 'Musk has always acknowledged that achieving full self-driving is not just a matter of technological innovation; if regulators aren’t convinced a robotaxi fleet is safe, it isn’t going anywhere.', 'That has implications for the physical design of vehicles. Cruise recently abandoned plans for a futuristic robotaxi vehicle with no steering wheel, returning to a more conventional design that a human could operate, primarily to reduce the risk of running afoul of regulators.', 'And governmental concerns could also affect software. Gianarikas says regulators who dig into the coding of a system built by “end-to-end” deep learning might not like what they find.', ""“You can imagine a scenario where [regulators] just kind of have this moment, like ‘What? You don't … have any hard-coded software rules?” he says. “‘How do you control it?’”"", 'Still, Gianarikas notes that while there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about a Tesla robotaxi fleet, Elon Musk has a track record of eventually proving skeptics wrong.', 'The event’s name — “We, Robot” — is a nod to a classic Isaac Asimov short story collection exploring the ethical and psychological implications of building increasingly human-like robots. It’s also the title of a very vaguely related Will Smith action movie.', ""Visitors look at Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus at its exhibition booth during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai on July 5, 2024. Optimus, a featureless humanoid robot, can walk and fold laundry. Musk has argued it could eventually learn to do almost anything a human can do."", 'That hints at the possibility that, in addition to a robotaxi, the reveal could feature Optimus, the humanoid robot Tesla has been developing as an autonomous laborer capable of doing repetitive tasks.', '“I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else at Tesla combined,” Musk told investors this summer. “A humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you asked of it. … I think everyone on Earth is going to want one.”', 'Optimus, a black and white robot with a featureless face of smooth black glass, can walk — in a stilted, gliding sort of way. Tesla has shared videos of it sorting objects, standing on one leg and dancing.', 'Dan Ives, an analyst and a long-time Tesla bull, will be in attendance on Thursday night. He’s less interested in androids and more in whether Musk can demonstrate a fully autonomous vehicle that actually works.', '“This needs to be a jaw-dropper type of event,” he said — hype and promises are not going to cut it.', '“Billions of dollars spent on this,” said Ives. “This can’t just be, “Get the popcorn out.’”', ' An earlier version of this story attributed a quote to Aurora CPO Sterling Anderson, as quoted by a company email.

', '“How many hours a week are cars used? Your average passenger car is only used about 10 hours a week out of 168 hours. So the vast majority of the time cars are just doing nothing. But if they’re autonomous, they could be used five times—ten times—more,” Musk explained. ', 'The Tesla CEO went on to say that with autonomous vehicles constantly on the road and in use, there would be less demand for parking space. As a result, cities could use parking areas for parks or more useful facilities. ', 'Individualized mass transit vehicles aren’t new to the world. In fact, some countries use smaller vehicles for transportation, like India’s tuk-tuk or the Philippines’ tricycle–which only travel short distances and specific areas. Tesla’s Cybercab is similar to a tuk-tuk because it only accommodates two people can travels short distances, and fits smaller roads. However, it is built for countries like the United States where “short trips” can stretch farther distances compared to countries like the Philippines. ', 'Tesla’s “We, Robot” event was definitely one for the history books like Elon Musk predicted. While the Cybercab, Robovan, and even Optimus were definitely sights to see, it’s Tesla’s future goals that were the real show stopper.

Alongside this was the unveiling of the new robo-van.', '""Optimus will walk among you,"" said Tesla\'s CEO, Elon Musk. ""You’ll be able to approach them, and they’ll be able to offer you a drink.""', 'Musk promised that these robots could ""do everything,"" including walking the dog, babysitting, and mowing the lawn.', 'And the price? Musk mentioned that the robot would cost between $20,000 and $30,000.', 'But it\'s not just about practical capabilities—Optimus knows how to make ""noise.""', 'Stay updated with the latest news!', 'Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter', 'After the presentation, videos surfaced showing the robots interacting with guests, chatting around tables, and playing party games. One of the robots even played rock-paper-scissors with visitors and handed out small gift bags. The highlight came when several robots were seen dancing inside a gazebo, adding to the excitement of the event.', 'However, it should be noted that the robots seen in the videos were actors, merely demonstrating the potential future capabilities of the robots, and were not performing the actions autonomously.', 'Tesla first revealed the plans for the humanoid robot Optimus in 2021, but at the time, it was widely viewed as a joke when a person in a robot costume danced on stage.', 'A year later, in 2022, Tesla unveiled a primitive prototype that cautiously walked across the stage. Since then, Optimus has undergone significant improvements, and the current model is lighter and faster, with abilities that bring it closer to functioning alongside humans in daily life.', 'Musk presented Optimus not just as a robot that will simplify everyday tasks but as a technology that will change the world. According to him, ""This will be the biggest revolution of any kind,"" and he predicts that in the future when millions of units are produced, it will significantly boost the global economy.', 'Musk went as far as to claim that the robots can ""end poverty"" due to the enormous benefits they could potentially bring to improving labor productivity.', 'The current development status indicates that Optimus is already in advanced stages. According to Musk\'s statements in April 2024, the robot is expected to begin performing ""useful"" tasks by the end of this year and could be available to the external market as early as the end of 2025. This means that Tesla\'s robots may soon become an integral part of the daily lives of many people.', 'As mentioned, Musk estimates that in the long term, the price will range between $20,000 and $30,000. At such a price, the robot could be accessible to a wide range of both private and business customers. Initially, its primary uses may focus on basic tasks such as cleaning, security, or home assistance. However, over time, the robot may also be integrated into more complex fields, such as medical assistance or education.', 'The future Tesla showcased at the recent event is not solely about technology but also about how this technology will blend into daily life. Humanoid robots, like Optimus, are not just performing practical tasks; Tesla has also invested equally in how they look and sound. The goal is to create robots that feel natural in their interactions with humans, speaking with accents close to human speech, incorporating natural pauses, and using slang that sounds like something we might say.', 'If Tesla succeeds in seamlessly integrating Optimus into everyday life, we may be on the brink of a new era in which robots not only perform tasks but also become embedded in human society in unprecedented ways.', '', '', '', '', '']"

And he also showed a larger vehicle that he said could carry up to 20 passengers or goods, which he called a “Robovan,” although he gave no timeframe for the introduction of that vehicle.', 'Musk said that in addition to Tesla selling rides in its own fleet of self-driving robotaxis, the robotaxis would lower the cost of ownership for Tesla buyers because they’ll be able to rent their cars out for rides when not driving themselves by using Tesla’s service to arrange the rides.', 'The planned robotaxi service would not only compete with services from Uber and Lyft that use human drivers but with other driverless services now being tested by companies like Google’s Waymo. In fact, those other driverless robotaxi services are already well ahead of Tesla’s planned offering, said tech journalist and CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who called the Tesla robovan design “a lovely toaster on wheels.”', '“I ride the Waymo (service) every time I go into San Francisco for a long time now,” Swisher told CNN late Thursday after the event. “They’ve driven millions of miles. Elon has just been talking about it. I would like to see him deploy something on the road. I’m very excited about autonomous vehicles. But he’s been promising them forever while others have delivered.”', '“This is typical of him,” she said. “He makes a giant announcement, and then you see nothing. He’s done amazing things, and I think that’s part of this. But in this case, there is stuff on the road right now that’s working by Google and by Amazon and others.”', 'Musk has insisted that the company’s data shows that the current version of FSD that requires a driver to supervise the ride is already safer than cars driven by humans. But others who have tested that feature question whether that is true. One independent testing service, AMCI Testing, found that drivers needed to take control every 13 miles on average.', 'This is certainly not the first time that Musk has laid out ambitious time frames for his plans for self-driving cars. In a July call with investors, Musk said he expected to have “unsupervised (driving) possibly by the end of this year,” adding “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”', 'But he also conceded, “obviously my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.”', '“I’m the boy who cried FSD. But I think we’ll be better than humans by the end of this year,” he said in a call with investors in July 2023, before adding: “I’ve been wrong in the past. I may be wrong this time.”', 'And even some analysts who believe that Tesla will eventually come up with the technology needed to have driverless vehicles carrying passengers believe that achievement is at least several years into the future.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTesla posts first sales gain of the year but shares fall as competition heats up', '“We’re looking at disengagements at 3% of miles driven,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, about the number of times that a human driver needs to take control, in an interview with CNN earlier this week.', '“While 97% of the way there sounds close, it’s not even close. It has to be well above 99%. And to go from 95 or 97% to 99% is really hard. And then there’s the question of how many 9’s the regulators will want to see. Is it 99.9%, 99.999%?” he added.', '“I think it’ll take two years to get the technology right,” Munster said. “And two to three more years to get the needed regulatory approval.”', 'As for Musk’s promise that the Cybercab would be available within two years, Munster pointed out that the Cybertruck pickup took about 48 months from reveal to production, and some other vehicles, including an electric semi truck, have gone more than six years since their reveal and are still not in production.', '“Looking at the more recent history of product announcements and measuring the time it took to ramp production should remind investors that patience is a virtue,” he said.', 'This story has been updated with additional context and developments.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

A fleet of Tesla Robotaxi prototypes rolled in during the We, Robot event in Los Angeles on October 10th, 2024. Soon after, personnel are seen to exit the vehicles as the cars form a line.', ' ', 'The full details about the features within and around the ‘self-driving’ taxi are still unknown, but Elon Musk says that Tesla plans to begin production of the Robotaxi over the next ‘two years’ and the release around 2026. If that happens, passengers are able to book a self-driving Tesla car using a dedicated app.', 'all images courtesy of Tesla, via X', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Looking at Tesla’s car prototype, one of the first features of the Robotaxi is its gull-wing doors, which passengers raise to enter and exit the self-driving vehicle.

5 Surprising Similarities Between Tesla’s Cybercab And VW’s XL1,https://www.carscoops.com/2024/10/tesla-cybercab-here-are-5-things-in-common-with-the-vw-xl1/,"['We put together a list of the similarities between Tesla’s all-electric robotaxi and VW’s fuel-sipping automotive oddity', 'When Tesla unveiled its futuristic Cybercab, many sharp-eyed observers were quick to spot an unexpected resemblance to an obscure eco-marvel from the past—the VW XL1. While Tesla’s latest creation wants to revolutionize urban mobility with full autonomy and mass-market ambitions, the XL1 was a hyper-efficient, ultra-limited experiment in fuel-saving technology. Despite their vastly different missions, the visual similarities between the two are hard to overlook.', 'Tesla’s Cybercab—or robotaxi, as it’s often called—is a fully electric, fully self-driving vehicle. Elon Musk has set his sights on starting production by 2027, with a projected price tag of $30,000. What sets the Cybercab apart is that it completely eliminates the steering wheel and pedals altogether, depending entirely on AI and a web of sensors to shuttle passengers to their destinations without human intervention.', 'More: VW’s 262-MPG XL1 Was The Perfect Skinflint’s Supercar, Here’s One For Sale And What It’s Like To Drive', 'Meanwhile, the VW XL1, a true unicorn in the automotive world, had a production run of just 250 units, all reserved for European buyers, with an eye-watering price tag of €111,000 (around $121,500 today). First introduced as a concept in 2002 that was refined in 2009 and 2011, the XL1 finally hit the market in 2013. Its headline feature? A mind-bending fuel consumption of just 0.9 liters per 100 km, or about 260 mpg. VW achieved this through a 0.8-liter, two-cylinder, plug-in diesel hybrid powertrain producing 68 hp, combined with cutting-edge lightweight materials and wind-cheating aerodynamics.', 'So, how did two seemingly unrelated vehicles—one an affordable robotaxi, the other an ultra-expensive eco-cruiser—end up looking like long-lost cousins? The most obvious explanation is their shared goal of aerodynamic efficiency, along with a desire to create something futuristic and desirable. Let’s break down the five key similarities that tie the Tesla Cybercab and VW XL1 together.', 'We start with the most obvious similarity, which is the overall shape. This is largely dictated by aerodynamics, as the droplet is the natural form with the least drag. The short nose and sloping roofline are common features among several concepts and production vehicles, but the effect is accentuated by the similar greenhouse design.', 'However, the XL1 pushes aerodynamics even further with its extended tail and rear wheel covers, designed to slice through the air with minimal resistance. In contrast, the Cybercab opts for larger disc wheels and a rising beltline that gives it a more approachable, less aggressive look.', 'Another key feature of the Tesla Cybercab and the VW XL1 is their butterfly doors, contributing to their futuristic stance. Besides the cool factor, the design makes it easier for occupants to enter and exit the cabin, especially in low-slung vehicles. This is why you usually come across unconventional door mechanisms on supercars and hypercars rather than SUVs, with the notable exception of the Tesla Model X.', 'The XL1 takes this one step further by incorporating portions of the roof into the door design, necessary given the car’s ultra-low height of just 1,153 mm (45.4 inches). While Tesla hasn’t released detailed specs on the Cybercab’s height, prototypes appear significantly taller than the XL1, making this door style more about form than function.', 'The omission of a rear windscreen is not as uncommon in 2024 as it was in 2013, but it’s another shared trait between the Tesla and the VW, contributing to the monolithic appearance of the rear deck. In the XL1, the lack of rear glass likely served weight and aerodynamic goals. For the Cybercab, fully autonomous driving eliminates the need for rear visibility altogether.', 'Interestingly, other new models, like the Avatr 12 and the Polestar 4, have also ditched the rear windscreen, marking a trend in modern automotive design that favors tech-driven solutions over traditional visibility.', 'This one might be a bit of a stretch, but both the Cybercab and XL1 boast full-width light bars on both ends that give them an undeniably sci-fi aesthetic, especially at night. While each model has its own distinct lighting signature, the Cybercab seems to take inspiration from Tesla’s notorious Cybertruck, blending angular, futuristic elements with clean, continuous light strips at both the front and rear.', 'Finally, both models have a two-seater interior layout, despite not being geared towards high-performance driving. The Tesla Cybercab has the unique trait of omitting the driving controls (no steering wheel or pedals), while the VW XL1 features a notable offset between the seats, making the maximum use of its narrow cabin.', 'A clear advantage the Cybercab has over the tiny XL1 is cargo space. Thanks to its fully electric powertrain, Tesla had more room to play with packaging, giving the Cybercab a larger trunk. The XL1, on the other hand, had to make do with a rear-mounted 0.8-liter turbodiesel engine as part of its hybrid setup, limiting practicality.', 'And that concludes our list with the similarities between the fully electric robotaxi (Tesla Cybercab) and the highly efficient automotive oddity (VW XL1). Do you think that Tesla designers intentionally copied (or at least were influenced by) the Volkswagen, or are these features simply the byproduct of engineering for maximum efficiency and usability?', '', 'Google News', 'MSN Start', 'Thanos Pappas, a product design engineer by trade, has been wading through automotive journalism for...

Musk provided few details about the actual costs of the vehicle, he added, and gave an “underwhelming” answer when asked about timing of the rollout.', 'By Friday’s close, Tesla stock was down 8.78%, and Cramer said the market’s reaction speaks for itself. While Tesla plunged, shares of Lyft\nand Uber\nrallied, with the latter hitting a new all-time high. The “existential threat” of robotaxis had weighed on the rideshare companies, but Wall Street doesn’t seem to be confident that Tesla’s Cybercab will be usable any time soon, he added.', '“Look, Tesla has a big problem: the electric vehicle market turned out to be substantially smaller than was thought,” Cramer said. “If they want to pivot to self-driving cars, they need to really flesh that out, and last night we just didn’t get much in the way of specific details.”', 'Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.', 'Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer’s every move in the market.', 'Disclaimer', 'Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC', 'Want to take a deep dive into Cramer’s world?

There's a large liftback-style trunk for cargo, and while the Robotaxi's design is sort of understated, its scissor doors are pretty cool."", '', 'Inside, the Robotaxi only seats two, and it looks kind of tight.

We expect a full suite of apps to be offered, for things like movies, games, social media and more.', ""Elon Musk says the Robotaxi won't just be a fleet-only service special, like today's traditional cabs.

There are multiple rows of seats that face each other, with large wall-mounted displays located at both ends of the cabin. One side of the Robovan features a sliding door that's at least partially made of glass, and there are two vanes of glass panels that run along either side of the roof."", ""While we now have our first glimpse of the Tesla Robovan, other than what our eyes can see and some mostly vague comments from Musk, we don't know much else about it.
