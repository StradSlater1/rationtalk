Iran’s Leaders have everything to lose in a direct War with Israel; Why take such a Massive Risk?,https://www.juancole.com/2024/10/leaders-everything-massive.html,"['', '', '', 'SHAHRAM AKBARZADEH\n10/14/2024', 'Shahram Akbarzadeh, Deakin University | –', '(The Conversation) – With Iran’s firing of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel overnight, the Middle East is again on the brink of what would be a costly, ruinous regional war. Israel and its ally, the United States, shot down most of the missiles.', 'Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately vowed to retaliate for the attack. He called it a “big mistake” that Iran will “pay for”.', 'The strike marked a dramatic shift in Iran’s calculations following weeks of escalating Israeli attacks on the leaders of its proxy groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and their forces in both Gaza and Lebanon.', 'Iran has traditionally outsourced its fighting to Hezbollah and Hamas. It has been very much concerned about getting dragged into direct confrontation with Israel because of the ramifications for the ruling regime – namely the possible internal dissent and chaos that any war with Israel might generate.', 'When Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran in late July, Iran’s leaders said they would respond appropriately. They basically left it to Hezbollah to do that.', 'And as Israel intensified its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon in recent weeks, another Iranian proxy group, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, claimed to have retaliated by launching missiles and drones at Israeli cities and US destroyers in the Red Sea. Israel responded with airstrikes on Yemen.', 'In this context, from the Iranian point of view, it looked like Iran was just sitting on the fence and not performing its leadership role in challenging Israel. So, to a large extent, Iran had to exert its role as the leader of the so-called “axis of resistance” and get into the fight.', 'Fighting Israel is very much a pillar of state identity in Iran. The Iranian political establishment is set up on the principle of challenging the United States and freeing Palestinian lands occupied by Israel. Those things are ingrained in the Iranian state identity. So, if Iran doesn’t act on this principle, there’s a serious risk of undermining its own identity.', 'Yet there are clearly serious risks to this type of direct attack by Iran.', 'Domestically, the Iranian political regime is suffering from a serious crisis of legitimacy. There have been numerous popular uprisings in Iran in recent years. These include the massive “Women, Life, Freedom” movement that erupted following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody for allegedly not properly wearing her hijab.', 'There is also a major dissenting view in Iran that challenges the regime’s anti-US and anti-Israel state identity and its commitment to perpetual conflict with both countries.', 'So, the authorities in Iran have been concerned that direct confrontation with Israel and the US would unleash these internal dissenting voices and seriously threaten the regime’s survival. It’s this existential threat that has stopped Iran from acting on its principles.', 'In addition, Iran has a new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who belongs to the reformist camp and has an agenda of improving Iran’s relations with the West. He has been talking about reviving the Iran nuclear deal with the international community, sending signals that Iran is prepared to talk with the Americans.', 'But the problem is the regional dynamics have completely changed since that deal was negotiated with the Obama administration in 2015. Iran has been a pariah state in recent years – and even more so since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began a year ago.', 'Since then, no Western country would deem it appropriate or politically expedient to engage in nuclear talks with Iran, with the aim of alleviating international sanctions on the regime. Not at a time when Iran is openly calling for the destruction of Israel, supporting Hezbollah and Hamas in their attacks on Israel, and now engaging in confrontations with Israel itself.', 'So the timing is awful for Pezeshkian’s agenda of repairing the damage to Iran’s global standing.', '“Iran Ballistic,” Digital, Dream / Dreamland v3 / Clip2Comic, 2024', 'Ultimately, though, it’s not the president who calls the shots in Iran – it is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Supreme National Security Council who consider matters of war and peace and decide on the course of action. The supreme leader is also the head of state and appoints the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).', 'The IRGC generals have been advocating for more serious and resolute action against Israel ever since the war in Gaza started. And it looks like the supreme leader has finally listened to this advice.', 'So, the regime has been maintaining a delicate balance of these factors:\npreserving Iran’s state identity and what it stands for in the region, and the need to manage internal dissent and ensure its survival.', 'In normal circumstances, it was easy for Iran to maintain this balance. It could manage its internal opponents through brutal force or appeasement and advocate an aggressive foreign policy in the region.', 'Now, the scales have tipped. From the Iranian perspective, Israel has been so brazen in its actions against its proxies, it just didn’t look right for Iran to continue sitting on the fence, not taking action.', 'As such, it has become more important for Iran to emphasise its anti-American, anti-Israel state identity and perhaps deal with an acceptable level of risk coming from a rise in internal dissent.', 'With its attack on Israel, Iran is also prepared for another risk – direct retaliation from Israel and all-out war breaking out.', 'The conflict in the region is really going according to Netanyahu’s playbook. He has been advocating for hitting Iran and for the United States to target Iran. Now, Israel has the justification to retaliate against Iran and also drag the United States into the conflict.', 'Unfortunately, Iran is also now prepared to see the entire Persian Gulf get embroiled in the conflict because any retaliation by Israel and perhaps the United States would make US assets in the Persian Gulf, such as navy ships and commercial vessels, vulnerable to attacks by Iran or its allies. And that could have major implications for trade and security in the region.', 'This is the way things are heading. Iran would know that hitting Israel would invite Israeli retaliation and that this retaliation would likely happen with US backing. It seems Iran is prepared to bear the costs of this.', 'Shahram Akbarzadeh, Convenor, Middle East Studies Forum (MESF), and Deputy Director (International), Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation, Deakin University', 'This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has remained silent on Israel’s threats to target Iranian nuclear sites, drawing criticism from journalist Ahmad Zeidabadi, who warned that any attack could risk catastrophic radiation leaks similar to the Chernobyl disaster.', 'In an interview with Al Jazeera in Doha, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi emphasized that Iran does not seek war but remains prepared for any outcome. He expressed hope that Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Qatar, could play constructive roles in facilitating a ceasefire. Araghchi also revealed that indirect diplomatic channels with the U.S. remain open. ', 'Saeed Azimi, Tehran correspondent for France24, reported via an Iranian source that bin Salman passed a message from the U.S. to Araghchi, stating that the U.S. is not aware of Iranian intentions but will not participate in any Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden held a call on Wednesday, which was also attended by Vice President Kamala Harris. Israeli sources indicated that the U.S. cautioned Netanyahu against a strike on Iran’s nuclear or oil infrastructure, whereas Netanyahu claimed that there is a historic opportunity to strike Iran.', 'Following the discussion, the White House shared a readout that included condemnation of Iran’s missile strike and expressed “ironclad” support for Israel. Biden called for minimizing civilian casualties in Lebanon, particularly in densely populated areas of Beirut, while stressing the need for diplomatic solutions to ensure safe returns for civilians. The ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas were also addressed, with Biden advocating for opening northern Gaza to aid deliveries from Jordan. Biden clarified that he opposes strikes on Iran’s nuclear and oil facilities, warning that targeting nuclear sites would cross “global red lines.”', 'Economic concerns have also been heightened by the conflict, with the Iranian currency and gold prices soaring amid fears of further escalation. On October 6, the dollar rate in Iran’s free market surpassed 63,000 tomans, and the price of a full gold coin neared 50 million tomans, while the stock market plummeted. The head of Iran’s Stock Exchange Organization noted “unprecedented stagnation” in stock transactions, with market fluctuations persisting since the October 1 missile attack. Global gold prices also surged, reaching $2,668 per ounce as uncertainty over Israel’s response continued to fuel economic anxiety.', 'Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian attended an international conference in Turkmenistan, entitled “Interconnectedness of Times and Civilizations – A Basis for Peace and Development,” and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 11. This marks the first meeting between Pezeshkian and Putin since the Iranian President’s inauguration', 'During the meeting, Pezeshkian emphasized the close alignment between Iran and Russia on global issues and expressed hope that a strategic partnership agreement between the two countries could be finalized at the upcoming BRICS summit in Russia. He also addressed the escalating crisis in the Middle East, accusing Israel of disregarding “international legal and humanitarian frameworks” and blaming Western powers for fostering regional instability. “European countries and the U.S. do not want peaceful relations among regional states to continue,” he stated.', 'Putin, in turn, highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation, noting that trade between Iran and Russia has been expanding successfully. He invited Pezeshkian to attend the BRICS summit and proposed a bilateral meeting on the sidelines, stating, “We work together internationally, and our global assessments and approaches are aligned.”', 'The BRICS group, originally composed of major developing economies, has recently expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE, reflecting its growing influence. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, the two leaders were set to discuss “a range of topics from bilateral relations to the situation in the Middle East.” Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy advisor, had earlier described the meeting as crucial, given the “dire conditions in the region.”', 'The meeting comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East following Iran’s missile strike on Israel and subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon. Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s attack, with the scope and intensity of its retaliation becoming a key topic in diplomatic discussions among the two sides’ allies.', 'Accompanying Pezeshkian on this trip, Iran’s foreign minister Araghchi has held talks with officials from Lebanon, Syria, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia in recent days to discuss potential Israeli responses to Iran. During his visit to Turkmenistan, Pezeshkian also met with Turkmen President Serdar Berdimuhamedow. Prior to his meeting with Putin, he held talks with Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, the National Leader of Turkmenistan, where he emphasized the “cultural ties” between the two nations and the need to expand cultural, political, and economic cooperation.', 'The international conference in Ashgabat commemorates the 300th anniversary of Magtymguly Pyragy, a renowned Turkmen poet born in Iran, who is considered one of the greatest figures in Turkmen literary history.', 'As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, activists from various backgrounds, including human rights, politics, and culture, are raising their voices in opposition to war. Narges Mohammadi, a jailed human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, recently shared her thoughts in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, discussing peace, imprisonment, and the struggles of motherhood.', 'Mohammadi emphasized that peace is “not merely the absence of war but also freedom from all forms of oppression, tyranny, discrimination, threats, terror, and insecurity.” Reflecting on her experiences during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, she recounted how the fear of bombings in her hometown of Zanjan deeply affected her teenage years. “I despise war,” she said, addressing the renewed threat of conflict in the region.', 'She argued that “those who start wars are condemned not only by the people of that land and time but also by the history of humanity.” In her view, the policies of the Islamic Republic have left a legacy of “discrimination, violence, tyranny, and oppression.” She declared, “The path to peace cannot go through the dark and destructive tunnel of war. I hate war just as much as I despise tyranny, and I am as committed to peace as I am to democracy.” Mohammadi also stressed that achieving sustainable peace in Iran and the Middle East requires upholding global human rights standards, eliminating gender apartheid, and fostering a culture of dialogue and tolerance—something that remains elusive amid the current unrest.', 'Singer Shervin Hajipour, who sang the protest anthem Baraye and was targeted by Iranian authorities, also issued an anti-war tweet. It stated: ', '“We do not choose where to be born ', 'I just hope no ordinary citizen, anywhere in the world', 'His life should not be sacrificed for war.”', 'Islamic Scholar Sedigheh Vasmaghi, who criticized harsh hijab laws and the Supreme Leader, leading to her imprisonment earlier this year, also issued an anti-war tweet saying “no to war.”', 'Separately, Reza Pahlavi, the former Crown Prince of Iran, issued a video aligning himself with military escalation against Iran and supporting coerced regime change in Tehran. Many commentators criticized the statement for aligning with Israel’s aggressive stance against Iran, similar to how the Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK) aligned with and fought for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war. “This is not the Iranian people’s war; it is the war of Ali Khamenei and his regime,” stated Pahlavi. “The Iranian people are not your enemies. The Islamic Republic is the common enemy of all peace-loving people in our region,” Pahlavi continued. Pahlavi did not condemn any of Israel’s actions in Gaza or Lebanon or threats to target Iranian civilian infrastructure.', 'Pahlavi asserted that there would be no power vacuum after a possible collapse of the Islamic Republic, stating, “We will not allow a power vacuum. A broad coalition of patriotic Iranians, both inside and outside the country, is ready to step in and establish peace.” On this score, the experience of the U.S. invasion of Iraq does not inspire great confidence in Pahlavi’s claim, as the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime opened a power vacuum and sparked a bloody, years-long sectarian civil war.', 'At the same time, a group of 360 academics, political figures, and civil society activists issued an anti-war statement, denouncing both Iran’s involvement in regional proxy wars and Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon. Signatories included notable figures such as Ervand Abrahamian, Touraj Atabaki, Mehrangiz Kar, Reza Alijani, Mohammad Reza Nikfar, and Shirin Ebadi. The statement condemned both sides of the conflict for escalating tensions and contributing to the humanitarian crisis, which includes death, displacement, repression, and the rise of extremism.', ""“The Islamic Republic and its fundamentalist allies have taken the Palestinian people’s aspirations hostage, while the Netanyahu government fuels war in the Middle East under the guise of a ‘new order,'” the statement read. It urged international bodies, including the United Nations, human rights organizations, and advocates for peace and democracy, to pressure all parties involved to agree on an immediate ceasefire. “End the madness of the merchants of death,” the signatories implored. “Defending peace is defending freedom and human dignity.”"", 'As the specter of war looms over the region, voices for peace continue to push back against the forces driving the conflict, calling for an urgent halt to the violence and a renewed commitment to dialogue and stability.', 'Internet conditions in Iran have reached a critical low, with numerous businesses that rely heavily on online access struggling with disruption due to censorship, slow speeds, and network instability. The public’s frustration is growing, particularly regarding the unfulfilled promises made by President Masoud Pezeshkian during his campaign to address internet filtering.', 'On Monday, Communications Minister Sattar Hashemi attributed the recent slowdown in internet speed to a “global problem,” allegedly caused by “increased content production” in the digital space. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, October 9, Hashemi responded to questions about whether internet censorship would be lifted, stating, “This is not a question that can be answered with a simple yes or no. There needs to be a smart and lawful approach to managing this space.” He refrained from giving a clear answer on internet filtering but called for stricter control over the sale of “illegal VPNs.” ', 'Hashemi’s claim sparked widespread reactions, even among government supporters, with many social media users demanding his resignation. Iran, the official newspaper of the Iranian government, addressed the filtering issue on October 9, calling it an “unchangeable promise” of the administration. The article stated, “Can filtering be removed by just pressing a button? Voters expect this issue to be resolved, but there’s a subtle point: ‘Change’ doesn’t come with a button that, when pressed, magically fixes everything.”', 'The government’s continued emphasis on managing internet access through restrictions rather than addressing the root causes of public discontent has left many questioning the prospects for meaningful reform.', 'On Tuesday, October 8, Mehdi Tabatabaei, Deputy of Communications and Information at the Presidential Office, reiterated the government’s pledge to provide high-speed internet and ease internet restrictions. “The issues surrounding internet speed and filtering will be resolved through a legal and reasonable process to meet the public’s legitimate expectations,” he stated. His comments came in response to the backlash over statements made a day earlier by Communications Minister Sattar Hashemi.', 'A group of 39 Iranian lawmakers has called for a reassessment of the country’s defense doctrine, according to a member of the Parliament’s Cultural Commission. Hassani Ekhlaqi Amiri revealed that the legislators submitted a letter to the Supreme National Security Council, advocating for a “review of the Islamic Republic’s defense strategy” in light of escalating regional tensions.', 'Amiri, in an interview with ISNA, stressed the need to bolster Iran’s defensive capabilities, arguing that “no international organization or even European and American powers can control Israel today.” The lawmaker referenced Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s religious decree prohibiting nuclear weapons as a cornerstone of the country’s defense policy. He noted that while this fatwa remains in place, within Shia jurisprudence, “time and circumstances” can affect rulings, allowing secondary decrees to override primary ones when necessary.', 'The call for change comes amid heightened tensions. In May, Iran’s current Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, then Secretary of the Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, warned that Israel’s threats could force nations to rethink their nuclear stance. Araghchi’s remarks followed earlier comments from Kamal Kharazi, head of the same council, who suggested that Iran might consider developing nuclear weapons if faced with significant threats. “If Israel acts aggressively, we may have to reconsider our nuclear doctrine,” Kharazi stated.', 'Following the letter’s submission, Mohammad Reza Sabbaghian Bafghi, a parliament member, openly advocated for developing nuclear weapons to enhance Iran’s deterrence capabilities. In an interview with Iran Watch, he responded to recent Israeli statements about targeting Iran’s nuclear, oil, and refinery facilities by calling for a change in the country’s nuclear strategy. “Our request to the authorities is to revise the Islamic Republic’s nuclear doctrine. For the sake of national defense and security, under the guidance of the leadership, we should pursue the same weapons that they possess. Building a nuclear weapon is a viable option for Iran to establish deterrence,” he declared.', 'Sabbaghian added that if Khamenei were to revise his fatwa on the prohibition of nuclear arms, producing such weapons would be “easy for us.” He further warned that if Israel threatens Iran’s energy security, “all of Israel’s oil facilities and those of its allies” would become “legitimate targets” for the Islamic Republic.\n\nAdditionally, Seyyed Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini and a figure close to the reformists, called for enhancing the deterrence capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, stating that the country’s military deterrence should be taken to a higher level. Some interpreted his remarks as an endorsement of developing a nuclear bomb. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has repeatedly warned that Iran’s nuclear advancements have pushed it closer and closer to the threshold of weaponization.', 'Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Pezeshkian’s administration has submitted a request to the Expediency Council to revisit Iran’s stalled efforts to adopt Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. Recent political developments indicate the current government is keen on reviewing the preconditions set by FATF, the global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing body. However, a decision on adopting the FATF recommendations would require coordination among multiple legislative and executive bodies.', 'The renewed push for the FATF began when the Executive Deputy and Acting Head of the Presidential Office, speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, confirmed that the government had sent a letter to the Expediency Council requesting a review of the FATF file. He added that the issue would require a domestic consensus. Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati recently announced that the president had instructed officials to take necessary steps to lift FATF-related restrictions in line with national interests, while also addressing internal concerns. Hemmati noted, “Through cooperation and unity, we have already eased financial restrictions, and important updates regarding the FATF will be shared soon.”', 'Omid Karimian, a member of Iran’s parliament, stated that resolving the FATF issue requires the government to present a convincing bill that protects national interests. In an interview with ILNA, Karimian commented on Economy Minister Hemmati’s remarks, saying, “If the government can find a solution that preserves national dignity and sovereignty, it will benefit both the country and the negotiating parties.”', 'Discussions on Iran’s FATF membership resurfaced with the start of the new administration, and the Economy Minister has signaled the government’s determination to address the issue. During his first press conference, President Masoud Pezeshkian stated, “The system has no choice but to resolve this matter.” The Rouhani administration tried and failed to secure final approval of the FATF recommendations following the adoption of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.', 'While some are expected to challenge approval of FATF recommendations, at least two members of the Expediency Council have expressed surprise about the reported letter. In a conversation with ILNA, one council member said, “No letter has been received from the government yet. If a letter is submitted, it will be added to the agenda for discussion.” Meanwhile, Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam, another council member, suggested that if the president personally defends the FATF with strong arguments, the council’s stance could change, but added that the council’s position has not shifted thus far.', 'Seyed Mostafa Mirsalim, when asked about the main obstacles to FATF approval, noted, “The only issue is the sanctions. If the sanctions are lifted, we have no problem and are actually stricter than FATF in some respects.” Another council member, Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi, also expressed no knowledge of the letter but acknowledged hearing about the president’s intention to submit one. “If the president wishes, the Expediency Council will certainly revisit the FATF review, though the outcome remains uncertain,” he said. These remarks come as Mirsalim emphasized that there have been no meetings on the FATF issue within the council for the past two years, highlighting the prolonged stalemate on the matter.', 'NIAC Action is dedicated to building political power for the Iranian-American community to advance peace & diplomacy, secure equitable immigration policies, and protect the civil rights of all Americans. NIAC, the 501(c)(3) sister organization of NIAC Action, is dedicated to educating & engaging the Iranian-American community in order to further advance these priorities.']"

,https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/504949/Message-is-clear,"['TEHRAN – In the aftermath of Iran’s missile strike on Israeli military and intelligence targets on October 1, Tehran has made its readiness for any potential Israeli retaliation unmistakably clear.', 'During a recent visit to Iraq, Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, emphasized that the country is fully prepared for any scenario that might arise as tensions escalate. This marks a significant shift in Iran’s strategic posture, signaling Tehran’s intention to both deter Israeli aggression and showcase its ability to respond decisively to any provocation.', 'The missile strike, named Operation True Promise II, was not an isolated action but part of a broader pattern of tit-for-tat military exchanges. Iran has consistently stated that its military operations are defensive measures in response to Israeli provocations, and this strike was no different. Operation True Promise II was a justified, retaliatory move meant to counter Israeli actions in the region including the July assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh and the killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC general Abbas Nilforooshan in Beirut in September in a massive bombardment.', ""The operation was a significant success for Iran. The missiles bypassed Israel's defense systems, causing considerable damage to Israeli air bases and radar installations. In response, Israel is now reportedly seeking to strengthen its missile defense capabilities by turning to the U.S. for additional support. According to media reports, the U.S. is considering deploying the THAAD missile defense system in the occupied territories to bolster Israel’s air defenses."", 'The Israeli regime’s reliance on U.S. assistance suggests that its air defense network has been severely compromised, and there are concerns that this reinforcement may not be enough. The THAAD system is designed to intercept short, medium, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase. However, the system is not equipped to counter the growing threat of hypersonic ballistic missiles, which Iran reportedly possesses in its arsenal.', ""Previously, Israeli air defenses relied on three systems: Arrow for long-range, David's Sling for medium-range, and Iron Dome for short-range, all of which failed to intercept many Iranian missiles during the recent attack."", 'Following the success of this strike, Iran has openly announced its preparedness for multiple strategic responses to any potential Israeli action. Sources within the Iranian military have disclosed that the country has developed at least ten different scenarios for Israeli counterattacks, ranging from limited airstrikes and cyberattacks to more comprehensive military engagements. This level of preparation underscores Tehran’s confidence in its military capabilities and its determination to confront any Israeli action with calculated precision.', 'Amid rising tensions, there is renewed attention on Iran’s nuclear program. While Tehran has repeatedly denied intentions to develop nuclear weapons, recent events have intensified speculation that Iran may accelerate its nuclear activities as part of a stronger deterrence strategy. This shift is underscored by a group of 39 Iranian lawmakers who have recently called for the development of nuclear weapons. Despite a long-standing religious decree by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei prohibiting nuclear weapons, regional hostilities have sparked public debates on whether this policy should be reconsidered.', 'As Iran and Israel continue to engage in a high-stakes conflict, the potential for further escalation is considerable. Iran’s missile strike on October 1 and its subsequent warnings to Israel and its allies highlight Tehran’s strategic readiness for any outcome. The fact that Iran has prepared multiple contingency plans shows its determination to confront any threat head-on.', 'How Israel responds to Iran’s moves will shape the trajectory of this conflict and could have long-term implications for the security architecture of West Asia. For now, Iran’s message is clear: it is prepared for any scenario and it is ready to defend its interests against any aggression, no matter the cost.\n ', 'All Content by Mehr News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.']"
Iran engages in urgent diplomacy as it braces for Israel’s response to missile attacks,https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/politics/iran-nervous-israel-response-missile-attacks/index.html,"['', 'Iran’s government is extremely nervous and has been engaging in urgent diplomatic efforts with countries in the Middle East to gauge whether they can reduce the scale of Israel’s response to its missile attack earlier this month and – if that fails – help protect Tehran, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.', 'Iran’s anxiety stems from uncertainty about whether the US can convince Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites and oil facilities, and the fact that its most important proxy militia in the region, Hezbollah, has been significantly weakened by Israeli military operations in recent weeks, the sources said.', 'The US has been consulting with Israel on how it plans to respond to Iran’s October 1 attack, and US officials have made clear they do not want Israel to target Iranian nuclear sites or oil fields. US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, their first conversation in almost two months, telling him Israel’s retaliation should be “proportional.”', 'The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, have also expressed concern to the US about a potential attack on Iranian oil facilities, which could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.', 'The Biden administration is deeply worried that the ongoing tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Israel, which began earlier this year after Israel struck what Iran said was its consulate building in Damascus, could spiral into a major regional war that pulls the US in, too.', 'A major part of the fears is that the US’ influence with Israel has appeared to be steadily waning over the last year. Similarly to its operations in Gaza, Israel has increasingly disregarded the US’ calls for more restraint in Lebanon, where Israel’s intense bombing campaign and ground offensive has killed over 1,400 people since late last month.', 'Israel also did not consult with the US before conducting a massive attack that exploded thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah operatives last month, or before assassinating Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and upending a delicate ceasefire proposal that had been put forward by the US and France less than 48 hours earlier.', 'Israel’s security cabinet has not yet reached a decision on how to proceed, an Israeli official told CNN on Friday. And while the gap between the US and Israeli positions is narrowing, it may not remain that way, a US official said.', '“We can’t actually know whether they voted or not,” a senior administration official said of the Israeli cabinet’s discussions, expressing skepticism over the level of transparency about what Israel is sharing with the US. The official suggested they can’t “put too much stock in the machinations” of the Israeli government.', 'As of last week, Israel had not given any assurances that it would not target Iran’s nuclear facilities, CNN reported.', 'Israel has for decades been planning attacks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, and just two years ago simulated striking them in a military exercise. Israel is also suspected of carrying out assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years, and Iran’s nuclear facilities have come under siege from cyberattacks, likely from Israel—the most famous being the Stuxnet virus, which was able to penetrate Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility.', 'Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued a strong warning to Iran about his country’s response on Wednesday.', '“Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all – surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,” Gallant said.', 'The Gulf states, broadly, are eager to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, the Arab diplomat said. While Iran has publicly warned that any parties seen as aiding Israel will be treated as aggressors, it is also unlikely that Iran’s neighbors would explicitly come to Tehran’s defense in the event of an Israeli attack.', 'But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have told both the US and Iran that they will not allow Israel to use their airspace to strike Iran, the Arab diplomat and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. Jordan also will protect its airspace from any unauthorized intrusion, regardless of the origin, a Jordanian official said.', 'The US does not believe that Iran wants to become entangled in a full-scale war with Israel, and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera this week that Netanyahu “is the only one who wants a war and to set the region on fire to stay in power.”', 'But the US has still urged Tehran, through backchannels, to calibrate its response if Israel attacks, an official said.', 'While Qatar regularly speaks to the Iranians and relays back to the US what they say, the US official said that ultimately “we just do not know what [Iran] will do.” Key voices within Iran will have different ideas about if and how to respond to Israel, but that will depend on the scale and scope of the highly anticipated Israeli move, another US official said.', 'This official said that messaging from Iran has been consistent both publicly and privately since Tehran launched its barrage of missiles at Israel earlier this month and there has not been a significant change in messaging.', 'Iran has been particularly interested in getting help from Saudi Arabia in preventing an Israeli attack and using their influence with Washington to help find a solution to the crisis, the Arab diplomat told CNN.', 'Officials from each country have met three times in less than a month, and Araghchi traveled to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to “consult on regional developments” and to “try to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon and Gaza,” he told local media.', 'The world is watching Israel’s every move as it contemplates how to respond. But at least until Saturday at sundown, Israel will be at a standstill to mark Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and the holiest day of the year in Judaism. And though it’s not impossible Israel might launch action, shops, restaurants and other services will be closed, public transport will not be operating and even the country’s main airport — the Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv — will be shut down.', 'CNN’s Kayla Tausche, Dania Karni and Katie Bo Lillis contributed reporting.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.
