"China's economic woes give its markets a week to forget, and its public little cause for optimism",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-economic-woes-give-markets-week-forget-public-little-cause-opti-rcna174466,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'BEIJING — A wave of optimism swept Chinese markets recently when Beijing announced a stimulus package many hoped would pave the way for a wave of investment to help fuel a recovery for the world’s second-largest economy. ', 'Traders rushed to buy Chinese stocks, sending the top Shanghai and Hong Kong indexes soaring.', 'But the measures that Beijing’s economic planning agency announced this week proved to be an anticlimax — the trillions of yuan that observers were hoping would be revealed never materialized. Investors were disappointed to say the least: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index suffered its worst daily drop in 16 years and Shanghai’s CSI 300 closed down for the first time in 11 days.', 'That slump comes against a gloomy economic backdrop for China, which is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and is beset with inflation and a sluggish property market. This year, youth unemployment reached a record high of 18.8%. Beijing might even miss its annual growth target of 5% — a figure it often surpassed prior to the pandemic.', 'Beijing said at a news conference Tuesday that it was “confident” it would meet its economic targets, and that message has been repeated by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has stated his goal of turning around his flagging economy. Late last month, he described China as being “well prepared” to overcome the “potential dangers” to his country’s prosperity.', 'But while Chinese officials project confidence, the markets and the country’s public seem less convinced.', '“Beijing is signaling to the market that there will be more stimulus ahead, but it will be measured and it will be phased,” said Keyu Jin, an associate professor at the London School of Economics and the author of “The New China Playbook.”', 'The Communist Party has good reason to approach the situation cautiously. In 2021, the collapse of China’s real estate sector just as the country began lifting its pandemic restrictions sent shockwaves through the economy. For many Chinese people, property is where they parked their savings, and the wipeout was brutal for ordinary homebuyers.', 'China’s economic sluggishness comes at a time when, diplomatically and militarily, it finds itself locked in a fierce rivalry with the U.S. and its allies, and the trade war that began with the Trump administration has only persisted under President Joe Biden. Its broader financial lethargy and this week’s market turmoil will hardly be welcomed by Beijing.', 'But what do this week’s events mean for ordinary Chinese citizens? For Fu, a 24-year-old graduate student in Beijing, this month’s paroxysms don’t change much on the ground. “Chinese people’s money isn’t really in the stock market. They tend to prefer saving,” said Beijing-based Fu, who declined to give his first name out of fear of repercussions for criticizing government policy.', 'Some of those who dabble in the stock market have been vocal about rising indexes in recent weeks, with users on Chinese social media reacting with enthusiasm. Even so, “they just want to rush and make fast money,” said Miao Yuqing, a 50-year-old retired professional trader in Beijing.', '“Most of them didn’t even understand the market,” Miao added, saying that ultimately “the market is very opaque … so in the end it’s only the elite making money.”', 'Far more likely to affect regular citizens is the raft of measures announced on Sept. 24 including rate cuts, making borrowing easier and freeing up commercial banks from having to hold large amounts of reserves. China also announced a new draft law on Friday that aims to revive its private sector.', 'Economists say Beijing has more stimulus up its sleeve.', '“What China needs is to do structural reforms,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, pointing to bigger pensions and unemployment benefits. “I do think they will announce something in that regard.”', 'Domestic stimulus aside, there have been outward signs that China’s economy is in trouble. In August, Beijing entered into an agreement with Washington to cooperate on future financial stability. That’s a far cry from the long-running geopolitical rivalry in which the world’s economic superpowers remain locked.', 'As for what’s next, Zheng Shanjie, chairman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, said Tuesday that China is “fully confident” of achieving its full-year growth target of 5%.', 'That target might be a bit optimistic for some analysts. Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said her team was maintaining an annual forecast of 4.7% for 2024, as it will take time for the aid injection to translate into “strong” economic activity.', '“It is clear that the government does not want to exhaust its policy tools too quickly,” Su said in a note, adding that the government could announce more support to “boost the real economy, recapitalize banks, and stabilize the property market.”', 'Janis Mackey Frayer is a Beijing-based correspondent for NBC News.', 'Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.', '© 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
Shift in policy to strengthen nation's growth,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202410/14/WS670c563da310f1265a1c754c.html,"[""China's economic growth is expected to strengthen on a sequential basis amid the latest stimulus package and with more incremental policies in the pipeline, translating into over 5 percent year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter, analysts and economists said on Sunday."", ""They said a long-awaited policy shift is unfolding for China's economy and markets, as policymakers have pledged to strengthen countercyclical adjustment and step up fiscal policy support. This will include the largest debt resolution support in recent years, with a particular focus on addressing pressing challenges such as the prolonged housing downturn, debt issues and sluggish domestic demand."", ""Their comments came as data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday that China's consumer prices rose at a slower pace in September, while the decline in factory gate prices continued, pointing to pressures on the world's second-largest economy and intensifying the need to roll out more incremental policies."", ""The country's consumer price index, the main gauge of inflation, rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in September, compared with a 0.6 percent increase in August. The producer price index, which gauges factory gate prices, dropped 2.8 percent last month, widening from a 1.8 percent fall in August, the NBS said."", '""The slower CPI growth in September was mainly due to still-weak domestic demand, seasonal factors and the high comparison base in the previous year, while the deeper PPI drop was influenced by falling commodity prices, especially in the energy sector,"" said Zhou Maohua, a researcher at China Everbright Bank.', 'Shen Bing, director-general and a senior research fellow at the market and price research institute of the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said the growth in CPI is expected to register a mild recovery while maintaining overall stability in the fourth quarter of the year.', 'This is because consumer demand has shown signs of pickup, with the sales of passenger vehicles and home appliances having improved, a trend that would be consolidated upon the implementation of incremental policies to expand domestic demand, Shen said.', 'On Saturday, the Ministry of Finance announced plans to soon introduce a comprehensive package of new targeted policy measures, with a key focus on improving the financial situations of local governments, facilitating the stabilization of a bottomed out property market, and enhancing the risk resilience and credit allocation capabilities of major banks, among other things.', 'The ministry said there is still ample room for the central government to borrow and increase its deficit. It plans to enhance the large-scale debt limit at once, replace the hidden debt of local governments, and increase support for local governments to resolve debt risks.', 'Chang Haizhong, executive director of corporates at rating agency Fitch Bohua, said this policy is the largest supportive debt measure introduced in recent years and will greatly alleviate the pressure on local governments.', '""It is expected that the hidden debt of local governments may be replaced in large part by increasing the issuance of treasury bonds in the future,"" he said.', 'According to Chang, the current economic growth is under pressure and fiscal revenue is lower than expected, making some local governments more stretched financially.', '""Once implemented, this policy will substantially reduce local fiscal pressure, unleashing fiscal funds for economic development and ensuring people\'s livelihoods. At the same time, the balance sheets of local government financing vehicles will also be strengthened,"" he said.', 'Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Golden Credit Rating International, said his team estimates that the size of the announced fiscal stimulus package will be at least 4 trillion yuan ($566 billion), surpassing market expectations.', '""It will directly drive GDP growth in the fourth quarter to rise above 5 percent, thereby helping achieve the annual growth target of around 5 percent this year,"" he added.', 'Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said he believes that much of the incoming fiscal stimulus will likely be used to fill the fiscal gap faced by local governments.', '""In addition to the 200 billion yuan for strategic projects announced by the National Development and Reform Commission, we expect the country to increase fiscal transfers to local governments and give them a large quota for borrowing,"" he said.', 'Lu added that policymakers might consider an increase in spending on social security to help those with lower incomes and to encourage childbirth, and they will likely provide funding to those presold residential projects that have been delayed.', 'Wang Keju contributed to this story.', '']"

In the press conference on Saturday, Lan Foan formulated somewhat ill-defined strategies to raise the volume of government borrowings and allocate funds to the consumer and property markets. However, specific measures were not clearly spelled out."", 'Specialists agreed with this view saying that for the investors who had been awaiting definite plans of spending, the current plan seemed vapid. Expectations to the announced fiscal stimulus plan\'s strength are low. Huang Yan, an investment manager at Shanghai QiuYang Capital Co said, ""There is no schedule, no figure, and no plan on how the money will be used"".', ""The range of stimulus packages anticipated by the market analysts varied from 2 trillion yuan to 10 trillion yuan ($283 billion to $1.4 trillion). However, what was said last month regarding China's preparations to launch special Sovereign Bonds amounting to approximately 2 trillion yuan and considering capital injections of about 1 trillion yuan for central state banks was not verified at the conference."", 'After the People\'s Bank of China undertook an aggressive move three weeks ago, the CSI300 index has gained 16% and is highly volatile within the day. Such market optimism has faded gradually, but now doubts have emerged regarding the effectiveness of the policy support for reviving growth. This was echoed by Huang, who said, ""If that is all that we have it in terms of fiscal measures the stock market bull run could run out of steam.""', ""We'd love to learn more about your experiences on GuruFocus.com and how we can improve!""]"

However, these announcements, deemed vague and insufficient, left investors wanting more, raising concerns about their effectiveness in reviving the country’s economy.', 'On October 12, China announced a series of economic measures aimed at supporting its struggling economy, mainly affected by a persistent real estate crisis. Finance Minister Lan Fo’an detailed several key initiatives. Among these, increased support for local communities to lighten their debt burden, issuance of treasury bonds to strengthen the capital of public banks, and the use of funds allocated to local authorities to stabilize the real estate market.', 'Furthermore, specific measures are aimed at supporting students to boost domestic consumption. These announcements come amid a slowing economic context, with growth forecasts for 2024 at only 4.8%, one of the lowest rates in decades.', 'Despite the scope of the announced measures, investors remain skeptical about their effectiveness. The South China Morning Post reports that many had hoped for more concrete actions and precise figures to reassure the markets. The lack of detailed figures in Lan Fo’an’s statements has reinforced these doubts.', 'According to economist Xu Tianchen, this uncertainty is because the exact amounts have yet to be approved by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. As a result, investors fear that these measures may not be sufficient to address the structural problems of China’s economy and sustainably revive growth.', 'In conclusion, although China has announced ambitious economic support measures, their lack of clarity and precision has left investors skeptical.

"Chinese Stocks Rally, Then Plunge—What Happens Next?",https://www.morningstar.com/markets/chinese-stocks-rally-then-plungewhat-happens-next,"['A financial stimulus triggered a short-lived bounce for Chinese equities, and investors hope the government announces new measures.', 'The Year of the Dragon is supposed to bring good fortune, but investors in Chinese equities may wonder whether this year will also bring adversity and market volatility.', 'Late in September, China’s central bank announced its most dramatic stimulus measures since the covid-19 pandemic, reducing borrowing costs to boost the ailing property market. Meanwhile, moves to enhance equity market liquidity lifted domestic stocks, with the CSI 300 and Hang Seng experiencing blistering rallies. This spread to China-exposed stocks, like European luxury names.', 'But the exuberance did not last, as questions grew about what Beijing plans to do next. Chinese equities suffered huge losses on Oct. 9, with the CSI 300 declining 7.1%—its biggest one-day fall since 2020. All eyes are now on Saturday, when the finance ministry will give a press conference to disclose what additional support is in store to boost consumer and business confidence.', 'Nicolò Bragazza, associate portfolio manager at Morningstar Investment Management, thinks a pullback after such strong market performance is to be expected. “The rally was driven by a significant change in market sentiment—which was at very depressed levels—following the announcements of new supportive measures,” he says. “One example of how depressed the sentiment was around China is the performance of Chinese equities during the equity selloff at the beginning of August. Chinese equities barely moved because of the already-depressed valuations.”', 'As the market awaits more clarity around the impact of future policies, Bragazza does not rule out significant volatility again driving sharp fluctuations in sentiment. “The role of fiscal policy is particularly important, not only because investors pay a lot of attention to it, but also because balance sheet recessions need this kind of support, as monetary policy may prove less effective without coordination with fiscal policy,” he explains.', 'He continues: “If the government disappoints, we may see some further pullback in Chinese equities, but we believe that the long-term rationale for such a position remains intact, as it is mainly driven by the sharp disconnect we see between company fundamentals and their valuations.”', 'The bull run that led the Chinese equity market to soar after years of stagnation was driven by authorities announcing several policies, including a mortgage rate cut for existing homeowners and extra liquidity for stock purchases to securities firms and asset managers', '“What has developed in the last two or three weeks is a change in the narrative. It is more a sentiment shift rally because policymakers finally capitulated and changed the policy narrative to become more pro-growth and stimulus-driven,” says Jerry Wu, manager at Polar Capital China Stars Fund, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Silver. “But a lot of that narrative shift has started to be digested. A lot of that re-rating has happened very quickly in a short period. Now we are at the juncture where policy needs to deliver,” he adds.', 'Wu feels Chinese authorities still need to provide tangible fiscal stimulus to deal with deflation and fragile consumer sentiment: “We have reasonable confidence that the sort of narrative pivot of a few weeks ago means they are pretty much committed to getting out of this downward and deflationary spiral.”', 'In this policy-driven market, Wu is hopeful that Saturday’s announcement will lead to another rebound for Chinese companies. However, he places significant importance on China’s policy around consumers and property owners to guarantee a sustainable boost for the economy and stock market.', '“The reason consumer confidence is very low is that their balance sheets are going down. 60% of China’s population has assets in housing. But over the last two to three years, China’s property prices have gone down between 30% and 40% across the board,” Wu says. “So when you have 60% of your balance sheet going down and you are not seeing the end of the pricing downward revision, you are not going to spend, even if you have quite a lot of savings.”', 'Sharukh Malik, portfolio manager at the Bronze-rated Guinness China A Share Fund, welcomes these initiatives but believes consumer support should be prioritized, as it has been neglected in the past.', '“When the government has tried to help the economy, they have tried to help business first rather than the consumer directly. There was a trade program announced a few months ago. If you have an old washing machine or TV, you can trade that in and get a subsidy to buy a new one,” he says.', 'Though he supports this trade-in program, Malik notes that compared with retail sales last year, it’s worth only 0.3%. He feels this package needs to be significantly expanded. “There are other ways they are trying to support consumers, so consumption vouchers are fairly new,” he says. “The government gives cash handouts and you can spend them on restaurants, hotels, cinemas. We saw in the past few weeks Shangai giving out $71 million to their residents. It sounds like a big number, but when compared with retail sales, it’s tiny.”', 'Malik believes the government will expand support by issuing sovereign bonds, which will allow them to raise capital for a larger trading program, and “cash for clunker” schemes, which could let the public trade in used cars for lump sums to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles.', '“What they have done so far makes sense, but it needs to be scaled up. And of course, no one really knows [what they will do]. Is it going to be announced tomorrow or next week? But I can see the path to growth because the government is making it clear in their statements,” Malik explains.', 'For Sandy Pei, portfolio manager at the Bronze-rated Federated Hermes China Equity Fund, any fiscal stimulus decisions must address deflation to prevent China from following in Japan’s footsteps. “The stock market is about confidence, and we talk about how cheap China is,” she says. “So why are people still not buying? Because they have no confidence. If you get confidence back, the economy can work on its own. But if you let things continue on its own, we are going to become like Japan, because the market will digest slowly, and once that perception has set in, things will get cheaper every day.”', 'Pei points to the Japanese property market, where yields of 20% are still not encouraging new buyers, who are worried about price weakness in housing. “In Japan, because they have seen that for so long, they do not believe property prices can ever go up. And that is very dangerous.” In Pei’s view, Chinese authorities must act as soon as possible to ensure consumption is a bigger driver of economic growth.', 'One stock that lifted Pei’s portfolio during the rally was digital broker and wealth management firm Futu Holdings FUTU. In the year to date, the stock’s share price has jumped 115.42%. “Their business by nature is leveraged, so their earnings will accelerate exponentially because trading volumes have jumped so much. You have seen so many new accounts opening. So far, the two-week rally has been driven by retail investors and passive buying,” she says. Pei also saw her investments in beer and dairy companies boosted during the rally, as the market priced in a possible consumer recovery.', 'Malik also saw many of the more obscure names in his portfolio lifted. Manufacturer Jing Chang Mechanical, consumer chip company Syna Wealth, and industrial automation equipment manufacturer Shenzhen Innovision Technology jumped during the bull run.', 'The top 10 holdings in the Morningstar China Index also saw a boost in their total return rates, with the charge led by JD.com JD (56.58%), PDD Holdings PDD (55.26%), and Meituan MPNGY (51.56%).', 'The author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

The index has since rallied more than 18%, its biggest two-week gain in nearly 20 years. The stimulus measures should have come far sooner, says Lun, but better late than never.', '“Before (the announcement), we were just counting our fingers every day,” he told CNN in his office in the Causeway Bay neighborhood, referring to the lack of business. “But now, we’re getting calls. Things are picking up.”', 'Hong Kong and China markets are on a roll. But whether the rally continues and, more importantly, whether benefits from the stimulus measures spread beyond stock investors and into the real economy, which is suffering from a potential deflationary spiral and is at risk of missing its own 5% target growth rate, depends on what hasn’t yet been said.', 'So far, the measures announced have focused on monetary policy, which typically refers to decisions made by central banks to influence the cost of borrowing and control inflation. Beijing has largely held back on unveiling fiscal measures, which can include the use of taxation or other measures to impact public spending.', '“The elephant in the room seems to be a lack of consumer confidence,” economists at Nikko Asset Management wrote in a research note on Thursday. “What is really needed is for the authorities to deploy the proverbial ‘big guns’ to push out more fiscal policies. Such a move could address this crisis of confidence, improve risk appetite and reflate the economy.”', 'Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in a social media post last week that this could be China’s “whatever it takes” moment, if its leaders end up doing “a lot more” than what’s already been announced.', 'That could come as early as Tuesday, when the country’s top economic planning agency, the National Development Reform Commission, holds a press briefing to announce a package of policies to boost the economy.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nCommunist China is celebrating its 75th birthday and its stock market is soaring. But not everyone is in the party spirit', 'There’s much debate among economists about exactly what Beijing needs to do.

Gone are the days of trying to decipher tersely worded statements, which left much room for interpretation,” they wrote.', 'The three financial chiefs directly addressed local and international journalists at the hastily arranged event, which indicated an intention to be transparent about such a major policy shift, they added.', 'Pan announced a cut in one of its main interest rates and reduced the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. He also unveiled cuts to existing mortgage rates and lowered the minimum mortgage downpayment from 25% to 15% for second-time homebuyers to support the ailing property sector, which many economists believe is the root cause of China’s numerous economic woes.', '“This time is different,” HSBC economists led by Jing Liu said last week in an investor note, which called the press conference unusual. “Everything seems like it’s happening all at once. But it’s still just the beginning.”', 'The investment bank is expecting Beijing to announce one trillion yuan ($142 billion) worth of fiscal spending on consumer products or large construction projects, which will directly stimulate the economy.', 'Another one trillion yuan may be set aside for recapitalizing banks or helping indebted local governments to issue bonds. The latter won’t give a direct boost to the economy but could help avoid financial risk, HSBC added.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nFrench tycoon gains $17 billion from China’s economic stimulus push', 'Reuters reported on September 26 that China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284 billion) later this year as part of a fresh package of fiscal stimulus measures.', 'Money raised from special bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance will be used to increase subsidies to encourage people to buy bigger or newer appliances like washing machines or refrigerators, and also to upgrade large-scale business equipment, it said citing unnamed sources.', 'Some of the money will also fund a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan ($114) per child to all families for each second child and any younger siblings.', 'Some economists think the Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping can afford to be much more ambitious with its money.', 'Jia Kang, formerly the director of a think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, told The Paper, a state-owned newspaper, last week that the recent “amplification” of monetary policy was necessary, and that fiscal policy must keep up.', 'He said Beijing should issue as much as 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in long-term government bonds, specifically to fund investment in the necessary infrastructure and public works that private companies are unable to finance.', 'Jia, currently president of the China Academy of New Supply-side Economics, a private think tank, was quoted as saying the potential bond issuance of up to 10 trillion yuan was “not unreasonable” because China had done something similar before.', 'Back in 2008, the country rolled out a four trillion yuan ($570 billion) fiscal package to minimize the impact of the global financial crisis. Jia said China’s economy had expanded sufficiently since then to support the issuance of Treasury bond financing between four trillion to 10 trillion yuan.', 'Analysts at Barclays said a 10 trillion-yuan fiscal package spread over two years would have a major effect on the economy, adding one full percentage point to growth, but that the plan was just “speculation” for now.', 'Any meaningful stimulus measures must tackle the problem of oversupply in the property market, experts said.', '“The policy pivot … is serious.
