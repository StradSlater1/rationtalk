Will northern lights return to Pennsylvania?,https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2024/10/11/northern-lights-could-return-to-pennsylvania/75625102007/,"['Aurora borealis, better known as the northern lights, could be visible across Pennsylvania on the night of Oct. 11 as the result of a geomagnetic storm.', 'The current forecast from the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center shows the phenomena being visible across the northern United States. Parts of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metro areas are within the limits for a potential sighting of the elusive Aurora Borealis.', 'On the night of Oct. 10, people across Pennsylvania were surprised to see the lights dance across the sky.', 'The geomagnetic storm is currently at G4 intensity out of a G1-5 scale. G4 storms could lead to some voltage problems on power grids. Other effects include temporarily degraded satellite navigation and disrupted low frequency radio navigation.', 'This geomagnetic storm is from a coronal mass ejection, which raced toward Earth on Oct. 10.', 'A coronal mass ejection is a large expulsion of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona, according to the SWPC. The energy was moving at 2.5 million mph, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for SWPC, during a virtual media briefing on Oct. 9.', 'Simply put, the solar storm is strong enough to push the charged particles farther south than usual where they interact with gases in the atmosphere and result in streaks of colors dancing through the sky.', 'According to SWPC, a G4 storm results in an Aurora that could be seen as far south as Alabama.', 'Dahl said in the Oct. 9 briefing that SWPC has warned North American power grids, and he said they have begun to take precautions to mitigate any effects from the severe geomagnetic storm.', 'To see the aurora, you will need to go to a place with a view of the northern horizon and limited light pollution. It will be difficult to see it from the center of a city or town.', 'In Pennsylvania, the best bet is to go a high place in the darker and more remote areas of your region. Luckily, much of the state is going to experience clear skies tonight. Western Pennsylvania could see partly cloudy skies.', 'In the press briefing, SWPC Space scientist Rob Steenburgh said cellphone cameras could pick up the Aurora better than the naked eye could.', '""People can pick it up now with their cameras, given the types of sensors that most cellphone cameras have these days,"" he said. ""So there is a chance, even if you\'re not seeing the naked eye, to still pick it up.""']"
FAQ: Northern Lights,https://www.travelhx.com/en-us/stories/faq-northern-lights/,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Faq Northern Lights', 'Check out our guide with the most popular questions about the incredible aurora borealis.', '7 mins read', 'The Aurora Borealis is most commonly seen in the polar regions, within a radius of 2,500 km around the magnetic poles. This area is known as the Auroral Zone or the Auroral Oval. For the Northern Lights, the further north you travel the more likely you are to catch a glimpse of the aurora. Above the Arctic Circle (66°33’N) is the best place to go aurora hunting which is why northern Norway and Svalbard are some of the best places on earth to see the Northern Lights. ', 'While technically, the Northern Lights are present for much of the year, there aren’t enough hours of darkness to see them during the summer months, even above the Arctic Circle. The winter season in the Arctic lasts from late September to late March/ early April. During this time, the Arctic sky is dark enough for the Northern Lights to be visible in the right conditions. The aurora is at its most active around the equinoxes in March and September.', 'The Northern Lights most commonly appear between 17:00 and 02:00. They don’t usually exhibit for long – they may only show for a few minutes, then glide away before returning. A good display may last for no longer than 15-30 minutes at a time, although if you’re really lucky, it could extend to a couple of hours or longer.', 'To see the Northern lights, the sky needs to be dark and clear of any clouds. Some people claim the aurora comes out when temperatures are colder. This isn’t the case – it’s just that when the skies are cloudless, temperatures tend to drop.', 'The light show we see from the ground is caused by electrically charged particles from space entering the Earth’s upper atmosphere at a very high speed.', 'But there are forecasts available. The Kp Index is generally considered the most accurate – it’s much more reliable than the weather forecast. The forecast corresponds to the planetary magnetic index on a scale of one to nine, with one being very low activity and nine very high. The Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska has an excellent website, which allows you to view predicted activity in all auroral regions. You can also sign up for Northern Lights forecast email alerts that tell you when activity rises above four to five on the Kp scale. ', 'Yes and no. The Solar Cycle refers to the number of sunspots present on the surface of the sun. This cycle lasts somewhere between 11-15 years. When the sun is at its most active and producing a lot of sunspots, it is referred to as the Solar Maximum and when the number of sunspots are at the lowest, it’s called the Solar Minimum.', 'The Northern Lights become more active and intense around Solar Maximum and in the three to four years immediately following the peak. During this time, the Northern Lights may be visible further south than usual, due to the increased number of electrically charged particles reaching the Earth. However, the polar auroras do not depend on sunspot activity at all. So, while it is true that sunspots affect the lights, this doesn’t apply to locations under the Auroral Ovals.', 'Dogs will often look at the sky and bark during an auroral display, which suggests that other animals are also aware of them. Although we can’t be certain, it is well documented that there are things which animals can sense that humans can’t. It’s possible that some animals may be able to sense the natural disturbance caused by an active aurora', 'There are records of people who live under the Northern Lights, particularly Inuit communities, who claim they have heard the aurora make a sound. Scientifically, it doesn’t seem feasible as sound doesn’t travel at the same speed as light. The aurora occurs 100 km up in the sky so anything making a sound would need to be propagating at the speed of light; otherwise, it would occur so long after the event that you wouldn’t connect the two. Audio recordings of the Northern Lights have been attempted but to date, these haven’t picked anything up.', 'However, nothing in science is impossible. There are theories that a form of electrical discharge from the Northern Lights could produce sound audible to humans but this has yet to be proven.', 'It depends on how intense the auroral display is. Moonlight will affect visibility if the aurora is faint – bright moonlight will make it harder to see or not visible at all, if you want to see how a full display develops, it’s best to go around the time of the new moon.', 'However, if there is a bright aurora, you will even be able to see it in full moonlight.', 'The Northern Lights and the Southern Lights are mirror images of each other. During the summer in the Arctic Circle, when the Northern Lights aren’t visible, it is winter in Antarctica so the Aurora Australis will be visible, and vice versa.', 'The Northern Lights are more popular with tourists because it is more accessible, more hospitable and there is more to see and do. During winter, the Antarctic continent becomes surrounded with thick, floating pack ice, making it almost impossible to get there. In contrast, the Norwegian coast, Alaska, northern Canada, Southern Greenland, Iceland, and the far north of Scandinavia and Russia are all populated areas with plenty of opportunities for tourists wishing to experience the Northern Lights.', 'Both the Northern Lights and the Southern Lights are visible from space. Astronauts on the International Space Station get a view of both auroras as they travel around the globe. But the view from space is much less variable than it is from Earth. From the ground, the auroral structures grow in the sky and change form depending on your distance from them. There’s much more variety in the Aurora you view from the ground than what you see from space.', ""There are auroral emissions on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and, we believe, Uranus and Neptune as well. The auroras on Jupiter and Saturn produce emissions in ultraviolet and infrared which are not visible to the naked eye, but specialist cameras are able to capture them. There may be visible auroras as well, but they wouldn't look anything like those on Earth."", 'Mars also has an aurora, but it is completely different to that of other planets. Unlike Earth, Mars does not have a global magnetic field. As an aurora is dependent on a planet’s magnetic field, the aurora on Mars does not appear as rings like we see from earth. The Aurora on Mars only occurs in certain places where there are magnetic rocks on the surface, and it’s much more localised.', 'The Northern Lights occur so high up in the atmosphere that they don’t pose any threat to people watching them from the ground.', 'The aurora itself is not harmful to humans but the electrically charged particles produced could have some potentially negative effects to infrastructure and technology. The particles produce an electrical current that reaches the ground. In very extreme circumstances, this could affect electric power lines, oil and gas pipelines, computer networks and iCloud systems. There could also be a risk to aeroplanes flying at very high altitudes. However, very few aircraft fly high enough, and any aircraft that did, wouldn’t be there long enough for there to be any danger.', 'Photographing the Northern Lights isn’t an exact science; there are a lot of variables to consider. All cameras and lenses will give different results, so a bit of trial and error is needed to find out what works best for you. It’s also important to remember that no two auroras are the same. This means that settings which work one night may not work the next. But don’t let that put you off; experimenting with different settings and seeing the range of results they produce is all part of the fun.', 'Greenland’s northernmost point is just 708 km away from the North Pole and forms part of the Arctic Circle. While the noun Arctic refers to that geographical area, ‘arctic’ is also widely recognised as an adjective to describe something as ‘extremely cold’. With that in mind, Greenland’s climate can definitely be described as arctic.', 'Every year, our ships sail in the wake of great explorers across the icy waters of the Fram Strait.', 'Be the first to hear about our latest offers, exciting itineraries and inspirational articles.', 'Mon - Fri: 6am to 5pm PT | Sat: 9am to 5pm | Sunday: 10am to 4pm', '© 2024 Hurtigruten Expeditions', '', '', '', '']"

Here’s how you can prepare for next time and a forecast for just when that might be, which could be as soon as tonight during an encore appearance.', 'The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, is the result of charged particles from the sun reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, creating a geomagnetic storm as it slams into the planet’s magnetic field. The particles are then redirected toward the planet’s poles, creating a dazzling and colorful display.', '“There is not a colorful cloud in space that’s coming our way,” said Justin Berk, meteorologist and founder of Just In Weather. “It’s invisible, but when it interacts with that high level ionosphere, that’s when these particles get charged up and put on this light display.”', 'Typically, the northern lights are confined to the higher latitudes. But in 2024, there have been multiple instances of them reaching much further south, including locales as far away as the Florida Keys. So it’s a rare phenomenon and for many, seeing the aurora is on their bucket list.', '“I literally got hundreds of messages each with anywhere from two to a dozen photos [of the aurora],” Berk said about submissions to his Facebook page. “They’re all amazing.”', '“It’s very rare for us here in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic to get them,” said Berk, who follows space weather nearly as closely as local weather, just as a hobby.', 'There are many reasons why: timing, cloud cover, light pollution, luck, your phone, your vision (have you had your eyes checked lately?) But the main one is probably timing, followed closely by your surroundings — basically, how far away from city lights you were able to get. Also, if you were relying on the naked eye, well, don’t. Use your camera phone — it’s more sensitive to light and should be able to capture even faint auroras that humans cannot see.', 'Most important for viewing the aurora in our area is the strength of the storm. Not every burst will reach as far south as the United States, and not all that often into Maryland. And when the geomagnetic storms do occur, the forecast for their arrival can be tricky: the sun is 92.49 million miles from Earth, leaving the ETA literally up in the air.', 'Also, know that the northern lights can arrive in pulses — they can be visible for an hour or 15 minutes, and then disappear, only to reappear two hours later with another burst of color. Thursday night’s storm likely peaked around 10 p.m. in the mid-Atlantic region. Patience is key.', '“It’s almost like a wave lapping up on the shore,” Berk explained. “And you’ll get one wave, and then it will retreat, and you’ll get another wave.”', 'Berk said the sun is in the middle of an 11-year cycle where it is more active with a higher amount of solar storms.', '“It’s sort of on an uptick,” Berk said “We’re in that peak now and maybe over the next year or two” is when the most opportunities to see auroras will happen.', 'So you’re going to want to pay attention to the space weather forecast. Seriously. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) runs the Space Weather Prediction Center, which offers predictions about solar storms, when they will reach Earth and if they will be strong enough for the lights to be viewed.', 'The website (swpc.noaa.gov) offers a map that shows where the aurora is most likely to be visible. Maryland residents are also going to want to pay attention to the Kp-index, which measures the strength of a geomagnetic or solar storm. In our area, we generally need a severe category storm to reach our latitude, a G4 at least, with a Kp of at least 7 or 8, although there have been reported sightings at slightly lower levels.', '“If you hear that there’s going to be a seven or eight, then the best thing to do is make sure that you get to a dark location — that means away from the city,” Berk said. “And hopefully you have some favorite spot picked out.', '“You know, it could be a park, it could be a hill, it could be a country road, but some place that is far away from city, urban lights, preferably on a higher elevation overlook, on a hill, or if you have a wide open view facing north.”', 'Based on the SWPC forecast, the answer is maybe. While a geomagnetic storm is forecast, it might not be strong enough for viewing tonight in Maryland.', '“There’s a really small chance,” Berk said. “And what I’ve been telling people is that if we do have a storm tonight, odds are it’s going to be much less intense … much harder to see.”', 'Berk noted that when solar storms are less intense, your odds of seeing auroras increase in the darkest, highest elevations, for example, in Western Maryland.', 'But we would never want to discourage sky viewing — our galaxy is amazing — so why not give it a peek when you’re out this evening.', '“It’s an imperfect science,” Berk said, adding that another reason you may have missed the Thursday night show has to do with time.

While G3, or strong, storm conditions were observed at 11:49 p.m. ET, scientists at the center confirmed the storm reached G4 conditions at 12:57 p.m. ET.', 'The storm arrived at Earth moving at 1.5 million miles per hour (about 2.4 million kilometers per hour), and reached the Deep Space Climate Observatory and the Advanced Composition Explorer satellites orbiting 1 million miles from Earth about 15 to 30 minutes beforehand.', 'The satellites measure the speed and magnetic intensity of the storm, said Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center, at a news briefing Wednesday.', 'A series of the most intense type of solar flares, known as X-class flares, have released from the sun this week. The flares also coincided with coronal mass ejections on Tuesday.', 'Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere. When these outbursts are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth’s magnetic field.', '“Geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth’s surface,” according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.', 'As a result, the center has notified the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the North American power grid and satellite operators to prepare for disruptions, especially given the amount of preparations and expected relief efforts for Hurricane Milton, Dahl said.', 'Historically, G4 storms are common during a solar cycle, but G5, or extreme geomagnetic storms such the one that occurred on May 10, are incredibly rare, Dahl said. This new storm has a 25% chance of becoming a G5, he said.', 'As the sun nears solar maximum — the peak in its 11-year cycle, expected this year — it becomes more active, and researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb.', 'Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create those different colored lights in the sky.', 'Currently, scientists at the prediction center believe visible auroras are likely to appear in central Eastern states and the lower Midwest, but it remains to be seen whether the storm will cause a global phenomenon of auroras as the G5 in May did, Dahl said. But if the storm escalates to a G5, auroras could be visible across southern states and elsewhere around the world.', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials recommend using the center’s aurora dashboard to find out whether northern and southern lights are predicted to be visible in your area. The dashboard is constantly updated and can show where an aurora may appear within minutes of the information becoming available.', 'The chance of seeing auroras has also dramatically increased, given that darkness falls earlier during this time of year. Sky-gazers in the US who spied auroras caused by a G3 storm over the weekend witnessed the northern lights within an hour or two after nightfall, Dahl said.', 'And even if the colorful displays don’t seem apparent to the naked eye, sensors in cameras and cell phone cameras can pick them up, center officials said.', 'NOAA scientists said they don’t believe this week’s storm will surpass the one in May. Before then, the last G5 storm to hit Earth was in 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaging power transformers in South Africa.', 'During the May geomagnetic storm, tractor company John Deere reported that some customers reliant on GPS for precision farming experienced a disruption. But for the most part, power grid and satellite operators kept satellites in order and properly in orbit and managed the buildup of intense geomagnetic currents on the grid systems.', 'The solar storm in May was the most successfully mitigated space weather storm in history, Dahl said.', 'Scientists are continuing to monitor the spikes in solar activity as they increase because they could indicate where the sun currently is in its cycle.', 'The speed of Tuesday’s coronal mass ejection surprised scientists at the center because it’s the fastest measured in this solar cycle so far, Dahl said. But that doesn’t mean the peak of solar activity is occurring right now. Previous solar cycles have shown that some of the biggest storms can happen after the peak, he said.', '“We are in the midst of solar maximum right now; we just don’t know if we reached the peak yet,” Dahl said. “That would be decided later and could be either sometime this year or even early next year. Bottom line is, we’re still in for a ride with the solar cycle activity through this year, as well as the next year and even into early 2026.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Wondering why the aurora borealis was visible so far south last night? Here’s why it’s all thanks to the sun,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/wondering-why-the-aurora-borealis-was-visible-so-far-south-last-night-heres-why-its-all-thanks-to-the-sun,"['', 'Amoré Elsje Nel, The Conversation', 'Leave your feedback', 'A geomagnetic storm lit up the night sky in parts of the U.S. during the first weekend in October. South Africa’s National Space Agency (Sansa) told reporters that the storm had originated from a solar flare “that erupted from sunspot 3842 on October 3.” It said this was the strongest Earth-facing solar flare recorded by Sansa in the past seven years and that the eruption briefly affected high-frequency radio communications, “resulting in a total radio blackout over the African region which lasted for up to 20 minutes.”', 'WATCH: Why the northern lights are being seen further south', 'What is a geomagnetic storm? The Conversation Africa asked Sansa’s Amoré Nel, who researches geomagnetics, to explain.', 'A geomagnetic storm is a disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field caused by solar activity. There’s a reaction called nuclear fusion that occurs continuously deep within the Sun’s core. This generates massive amounts of energy. Some of the energy is released as light (sunlight), some as radiation (solar flares), and some as charged particles.', 'The Sun also continuously emits a stream of charged particles known as the solar wind. Occasionally, the Sun releases larger bursts of energy, called coronal mass ejections. It sends clouds of these charged particles, or plasma, hurtling through space. I like to explain it to children this way: the Sun sometimes drinks a soda too fast and then burps. This “burp” is the cloud of plasma which then travels through space. These emissions don’t always hit us. But when they do, they collide with Earth’s magnetic field, disrupt it, and lead to a geomagnetic storm.', 'Earth’s magnetic field is an invisible force that surrounds our planet, acting like a giant magnet with a north and south pole. It helps protect us from harmful solar radiation by deflecting charged particles from the Sun.', 'The solar flare from 3842 emitted both X-flares (radiation) and a coronal mass ejection. X-flares are radiation; they travel at almost the speed of light and reach Earth within minutes. That’s what caused the brief communications disruption Sansa mentioned on 3 October. But the coronal mass ejection takes much longer to reach us. We’d predicted it would do so over the past weekend but in fact it only reached us on the morning of 8 October.', 'Geomagnetic storms occur fairly often. Minor ones happen multiple times per year. The severity of a storm depends on how strong the solar event was that caused it. Larger, more intense storms are less common but can happen every few years. Solar events are closely tied to the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle, which has periods of high and low activity. During the peak of the cycle, called solar maximum, more sunspots and solar flares occur, increasing the likelihood of solar storms.', 'We are now heading towards the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which will be in July 2025. Solar maxima usually last between two and three years.', 'Geomagnetic storms are not typically harmful to humans directly, but they can pose risks to modern technology and infrastructure. One of the most notable dangers is to power grids. Powerful storms can induce electric currents in power lines, potentially overloading transformers and causing blackouts, as happened in Quebec, Canada, in 1989.', 'Satellites in space are also vulnerable. A strong storm can damage electronics onboard, disrupt communication signals, and shorten the lifespan of the satellites themselves.', 'In aviation, geomagnetic storms can disrupt radio communication and GPS signals, which are vital for aircraft navigation. This is especially important for flights that pass near the polar regions, where the effects of geomagnetic storms are more pronounced. Astronauts and spacecraft are also at risk – the extra radiation can be dangerous for equipment and human health.', 'Auroras are a visually stunning aspect of geomagnetic storms. These colorful displays in the night sky occur when charged particles from the Sun get captured in Earth’s magnetic field lines, and funnel down towards the poles. Here they interact with Earth’s atmosphere, releasing energy that produces shimmering lights.', 'The northern lights or aurora borealis are visible over the Tappan Zee or Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge Bridge on Oct. 11, 2024 near New York City. Photo by Roy Rochlin/ Getty Images', 'Auroras can be seen at both the north and south pole, aptly named the northern and southern lights. If storms are big enough, it’s possible to see them in regions much further away from the poles. This happened in South Africa on 11 May 2024.', 'Studying geomagnetic storms provides valuable insights into space weather. By understanding how the Sun’s activity affects Earth, scientists can better predict future storms and work to protect the technologies we rely on. The study of geomagnetic storms also contributes to our understanding of the Sun and space in general.', 'Geomagnetic storms are monitored using various instruments on Earth and in space. On Earth, magnetometers measure changes in the magnetic field, allowing scientists to track disturbances as they happen. Sansa operates a dense network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers in Africa, and magnetometer stations in various parts of southern Africa, for this reason. The agency is currently setting up a magnetometer station in Ethiopia, too. This will improve our ability to monitor geomagnetic storms.', 'In space, satellites equipped with sensors monitor the Sun’s activity and detect solar flares or coronal mass ejections before they reach Earth. This data feeds into prediction models used in space weather centers across the globe.', 'Once a storm is detected, agencies like Sansa issue alerts and forecasts. These warnings help industries such as power grid operators, satellite companies and aviation authorities to prepare for a storm.', 'For example, power companies can temporarily shut down or reconfigure parts of the grid to avoid overloading during a storm. Satellite operators can place their spacecraft into safer operating modes, such as switching off electronic components, and airlines can reroute flights away from high-risk areas.', 'Monitoring alone can’t prevent all the damage caused by geomagnetic storms. But it can greatly reduce the risks. Thanks to early warning systems we can protect crucial infrastructure and minimize the effect these storms have on our daily lives.', 'This article was originally published by The Conversation.', 'Left: The aurora borealis, also referred to as northern lights, appear over a darkened neighborhood still without electricity nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene, in Asheville, North Carolina, Oct. 10, 2024.
