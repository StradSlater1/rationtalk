You have to have an egg plate,"" she said, adding, ""We don\'t ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.""', ""The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal data shows.

Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which predicts in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.', 'Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices. ', 'H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected poultry and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats ', 'For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers fed up with inflation.

When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,"" the spokesperson added.', 'With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.', 'Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. — a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.', '""Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There\'s a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,"" Volpe said. ""Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren\'t there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.""', 'For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.', 'As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.', '""[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.""', 'Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic. ', '""You can go on social media and you\'ll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go \'I just got it for $4.\' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,"" Volpe said. ""Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you\'re going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.""', 'Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.

David, let me start with you.', 'Help us by putting these prices, these high prices into perspective. In the historical context, where do they stand?', 'David Anderson, Texas A&M University:', ""Well, these are all time record high prices. So, you know, in a historical context, we're at the peak. We're the highest they've ever been."", 'John Yang:', 'Are there some regions of the country that are harder hit the prices are higher than in others?', 'David Anderson:', ""Well, yeah, there are. Particularly if we look at the coast, New York and California, we certainly see higher prices there for the same reason they're always higher in those locations. One is it's a long way from where we produced the majority of the eggs in the U.S. to those markets. But you know, once you get down, if you're going to deliver to a store in New York City, you know, it's probably a little more costly to get to those markets."", 'John Yang:', 'And David, how big a factor is bird flu in this and are there other factors as well?', 'David Anderson:', ""That really is the key factor. That really is the factor in these prices. You know, we have other things like a long term increase in demand for eggs as we've increased our protein in our diets. Eggs compete as a protein source with meats and other vegetable protein sources."", 'But you know, those long term trends and increasing demand are really dwarfed by this sudden shock to the system of a disease outbreak that wipes out a portion of our supplies.', 'John Yang:', ""Angela, let me ask you about this disease outbreak. Tell us about this latest strain of the bird flu and why it's so persistent."", ""Angela Rasmussen, University of Saskatchewan: So there's actually multiple strains of the bird flu that are currently circulating in wild birds as well as in the nation's dairy cattle. We actually have multiple spillovers occurring to these different poultry farms. Some of these viruses are coming from wild birds, some of these viruses are coming from wild birds that have contracted the virus from the dairy cows."", ""There's a number of other species, such as cats as well, that are also getting infected. So there's actually quite a lot of H5N1 influenza viruses circulating around in the environment in other species of animals. And that is partly responsible for both the increased number of flock outbreaks as well as the increased number of human cases."", 'John Yang:', ""Talk about those human cases. The CDC says that in the United States there are about 66 human cases. And last recently we had the first death of in the United States. What's the risk to humans and how worried should people be about it?"", 'Angela Rasmussen:', ""Yeah, so this is a really complicated question because people should definitely be concerned about it. But at this time, the risk to the general population is quite low. And part of the reason for that is we've seen no evidence of sustained human to human transmission with these viruses."", ""So every one of these human cases is actually getting the virus from animal, either from a bird, the case that you mentioned that was severe and died was contracting the virus from a backyard flock of poultry, or they're getting it from dairy cattle. So these are a lot of occupational exposures that we're seeing. We're not actually seeing the virus spread from human to human."", ""That said, that's good news, but it's still very concerning because the more human cases there are, the greater the likelihood that this virus could mutate to be able to transmit efficiently from human to human. So while the risk to the population is low unless you're handling or in close proximity with one of these animal species, we really do need to keep an eye on this to make sure that any human to human transmission is detected before it has the opportunity to spread outward into the human population."", 'John Yang:', 'And Angela, should people be concerned or worried about eating eggs, for instance?', 'Angela Rasmussen:', ""So eggs are actually quite safe to eat, as is milk, as long as it's cooked or pasteurized. I wouldn't recommend eating raw eggs right now because we do know that eggs can support the growth of influenza viruses. In fact, that's how we often grow vaccines for flu. They really grow up a lot of virus. So make sure you cook the eggs, make sure you're drinking pasteurized milk, but otherwise the food supply is safe."", 'John Yang:', ""David, what's it going to take to bring these prices down to Earth?"", 'David Anderson:', 'Well, the first thing we need is the disease to quit occurring and wiping out chicken farms. And the second thing is just time. Time to rebuild flocks to replace the lost birds. And that just takes a little bit of time.', 'John Yang:', ""Talk about that how? I mean, we're talking about the flocks that have been destroyed. As soon as it shows up in a flock, they — to try to keep it from spreading, they destroy the flock. How long does it take to rebuild that flock?"", 'David Anderson:', ""Well, it takes about 26 weeks to grow a hen, a pullet, they're called, to get them to where they start laying eggs. And then it takes a little while longer eggs fully sized. The first ones are kind of small. So to get to the eggs, the large ones that we see at the store, or extra large, if you like, those takes a little bit longer."", ""And so, you know, just think about, you know, here we are with biology. That's really our time constraint. It just takes some time to do that. You know, although we can look at egg prices and they're highly volatile. You know, we go back to 2022, '23, and went from over $5 a dozen to $0.84 per dozen by May of '23. So the potential for lower prices is there.

An egg shortage has plagued egg prices and inventory across the country, and despite what some might have you think, it has little to do with politics and a lot to do with supply and demand."", 'While on the campaign trail, one of now-President Donald Trump\'s promises was to ""immediately bring prices down"" on eggs. So far, that hasn\'t happened.', 'Egg prices in Pensacola, Florida, averaged around $5.36 for a dozen, when online prices were compared between grocery retailers like Publix, Winn-Dixie and Walmart, marking a 29.4% increase from the national average of $4.14 reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in December.', ""The price of eggs across the country has risen to $6.70 per dozen, according to the USDA's Jan. 31 egg markets overview report, which is a 61.8% increase from December."", 'Prices for eggs, gasoline and a myriad of other projects have commonly been used as political ammunition against whoever is sitting in office, but while there are fair points to make, the president typically has little direct control over the price of goods.', ""In reality, the current egg shortage has little to do with former President Joe Biden and current President Trump. Not yet, at least. While Trump's recently announced tariffs will certainly raise prices for American consumers across the board, prices haven't changed for anything just yet."", ""Here's what to know about the true culprit of the rising cost of eggs and what's responsible for the current egg shortage: Avian flu."", 'A recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it observed that wholesale prices for graded eggs have continued to increase as supplies continued to be limited.

""', 'Egg prices have been pretty volatile since 2022, thanks to the bird flu. When Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the national average price of a dozen eggs was $1.46. Prices were already on a general uptick, however, with the lowest price recorded in the past five years, hitting $1.20 in June 2019.', 'Prices began to trend higher after COVID-19 came about in 2020, but a huge uptick is seen in 2022 when bird flu outbreaks began to devastate flocks around the U.S. Egg prices hit their peak of $4.82 in January 2023 before dropping to near pre-2022 levels of about $2.04 in August 2023.', 'Another huge outbreak of avian flu is now set to skyrocket egg prices. The USDA now expects that retail egg prices are likely to increase by 20% in 2025.', 'As of right now, an accurate answer to this question is up in the air.', ""On Monday, Trump announced that he was pausing the 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico for a month after he reached an agreement with Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum."", ""Under the new deal, Mexico will send 10,000 troops to the country's northern border to help curb drug trafficking into the U.S. In return, Trump has agreed to temporarily postpone tariffs until Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick can hold further negotiations with Mexico."", 'If, ultimately, a 25% tariff is placed on imports from Mexico, the following items could be affected, according to Trading Economics and the Observatory of Economic Complexity:', 'When a tariff is placed on imported goods, it essentially acts as a surcharge attached to the price of the good. The companies importing those goods are the ones that are responsible for paying those tariffs, which could be U.S. companies who intend to sell or use the goods here, or foreign companies who may or may not have a U.S. presence.', ""What you're not likely to see is a flat 10% or 25% increase in prices across the board, however. Tariff fees are often applied to a lower import price paid by companies who purchase the goods from abroad. Retail prices are marked up based on those costs, but exactly how those prices will shake out will depend on the company.""]"

Simply put: Fewer available eggs mean higher prices.', 'This isn’t the first time Charlotte restaurants or consumers have dealt with rising egg costs. In 2015, an outbreak of avian influenza in the Midwest brought egg production in the U.S. down by 10 percent, resulting in higher egg prices.', 'With the current rising egg costs, Charlotte bakeries and restaurants have had to reassess how they operate — from contemplating prices to using creative ways to save ingredients.', 'The Batch Maker, a small batch bakery located in Seversville in the Wesley Heights area, is best known for its affordable cakes, indulgent brownies and cookies and melt-in-your-mouth cheesecakes.', 'Like most bakeries, eggs are an integral ingredient in The Batch Makers’ arsenal and are used in a majority of the bakery’s recipes.

Are Eggs Safe to Eat During the Bird Flu Outbreak? Here's What Experts Are Saying,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a63631311/are-eggs-safe-to-eat-bird-flu-outbreak/,"['For people, bird flu is generally hard to get. But there are still precautions you can take.', '', 'The National Institutes of Health reports that avian influenza A virus, or bird flu, is now widespread in wild birds all over the world. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) also states that over 18 million birds have contracted the virus in this country.', 'The avian influenza is a disease previously known to primarily spread between birds and poultry, not other species. However, one specific subtype of bird flu called the H5N1 virus has crossed over to infect mammals, like cows, and in limited instances, people. As of this writing on January 30, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control reports that there have been 67 reported cases of bird flu in humans in the U.S., with one death since March 2024. It’s important to know that the CDC categorizes the risk to the general public as low, however.', 'For people, bird flu is generally hard to get. In terms of transmission, there’s been no documented case of person-to-person contact in the U.S. (although there have been rare cases of this happening in other countries). Instead, those who got infected had direct contact with poultry or dairy cows through their work, or contact with backyard birds or wild birds. These people had either close, lengthy contact with an infected bird or contact with their bodily fluids in most situations. According to the University of Chicago, human symptoms of bird flu include pink eye, a sore throat, a fever, cough and muscle aches.', ""Although most of us won't contract it, the bird flu is still presenting challenges for many of us — especially in terms of some of the basic food we eat. For instance, if a flock of chickens on a farm gets infected with the bird flu, farmers have to kill all of that flock. Because of this, egg prices have almost doubled in recent weeks. This then begs the question: Can you get the bird flu from eating eggs? Here's what experts have to say."", '“The risk of getting the H5N1 bird flu virus from eggs is minimal to none, and safe storage and cooking of eggs reduces any potential risk,” says Geeta Sood, M.D., ScM, assistant professor of medicine in the Johns Hopkins Medicine Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, DC.', 'That’s a relief. It’s also important to know that the USDA inspects every poultry and egg product plant in the country and tests flocks so the chance of bird flu being transferred to your local grocery store is really small. Still, it’s wise to take certain precautions when it comes to eating eggs.', 'The chicken comes first — and then the egg. A recent UK study found that chickens quickly become very obviously sick after being infected with HPN1 and show symptoms like diarrhea and breathing difficulty. They also usually stop laying eggs. Any eggs they do lay look malformed: they’re too small and have soft and/or thin shells. Both sick chickens and strange-looking eggs are immediately removed from the food process. To be extra careful, if you see an egg in a carton that doesn’t look right, don’t buy it, or if it’s already in your fridge, toss it.', 'Yes. Unpasteurized eggs are a no-go. Pasteurization is key because it involves heating an egg to a specific temperature, which would kill any bird flu that was present. You also want to make sure the pasteurized eggs you buy are in good, safe condition. “Buy eggs that are sold from a refrigerator, and avoiding cartons with cracked eggs,” says Gregory D. Weston, M.D., MS, associate hospital epidemiologist at Montefiore Medical Center and associate professor of medicine, infectious diseases, at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, NY. At home, “always store eggs in a refrigerator, and consume eggs within 3 weeks and before the expiration date,” he adds.', '', 'No. “Do not eat raw eggs,” says Yoshua Quinones, M.D., a board certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York City. You also want to avoid runny eggs, so for now, skip the eggs Benedict, and make sure your scrambled eggs are extra-fluffy, not wet. “Eggs should be cooked until both the yolk and white are firm,” says Dr. Weston. “For casseroles containing eggs, the temperature should reach at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.”', '“Always wash your hands after touching eggs, and wash eggs before cracking them open,” says Dr. Quinones. It’s important to use the right technique to be thorough. “Proper handwashing includes scrubbing for at least 20 seconds with hot, soapy water, including fingers and fingertips,” says Dr. Weston. “You can time this by singing the ‘Happy Birthday’ song twice.”', 'You also want to clean up the right way by washing utensils and cooking equipment in hot, soapy water, plus any surfaces your eggs touched.

Robertson said she’s paying about $8 a dozen for eggs, one of the highest prices in recent memory.', '“It definitely impacts the sales because you know you have to make up the cost somehow, so therefore your cakes and everything else, the price increases, which is a turnoff to the customer base. They don’t want to pay the cost, but we can’t eat the cost,” she said.', 'Nationally, eggs are in short supply and prices have risen to record levels due to the most recent avian influenza outbreak. According to the Consumer Price Index, the price for a dozen large eggs in the United States has jumped 36.8% since last year.', 'Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a dozen Grade A large eggs cost $2.51 in December 2023 and increased to $4.14 a year later in December 2024.', 'Grocery stores across central Pennsylvania are selling a dozen eggs for about $4.69 and up, depending on the brand and type.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.', '""Egg prices are going up because of the avian flu, but that’s driving people to buy more eggs than they usually do because they’re anticipating higher prices and reduced grocery store supply,"" Vastani told USA TODAY.', 'That constrains the supply both because of bird flu, which results in some eggs being destroyed before they reach store shelves, and over-buying by some shoppers, she said.

HPAI is devastating to farmers and the birds they raise. ', '“Extensive on-farm biosecurity and stringent disease prevention practices in place are effective, but not foolproof, and the migration of wild birds and waterfowl spreading the disease have led to continued cases of bird flu in Ohio’s commercial poultry flocks. ', '“The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) and USDA have been supporting farmers in counties affected by this virus. These farms are working closely with federal and state officials to take necessary precautions and emergency measures to prevent the disease from spreading further.
