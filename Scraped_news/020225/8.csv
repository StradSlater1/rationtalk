Advocates Decry Trump For Blaming Plane Crash On People With Disabilities,https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2025/01/31/advocates-decry-trump-for-blaming-plane-crash-on-people-with-disabilities/31279/,"['by Michelle Diament | January 31, 2025', 'President Donald Trump speaks about a collision involving an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter during a press briefing at the White House in Washington on Thursday. (Yuri Gripas/Abaca Press/TNS)', 'Over a dozen disability advocacy groups are blasting President Donald Trump for baselessly implicating federal workers with disabilities in the deadly American Airlines plane crash near Washington, D.C.', 'Less than a day after the passenger flight collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport leaving no survivors, Trump told reporters said that diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame. During a briefing on the crash, Trump cited a Fox News article from last year.', '“It says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce and they want them in and they can be air traffic controllers. I don’t think so,” Trump said.', 'Advertisement - Continue Reading Below', 'The information referenced in the article that the president cited has been in place on the FAA’s website since at least 2013, including the entirety of Trump’s first term, according to Snopes, the fact-checking website.', 'In a statement, disability advocates called Trump’s remarks and any suggestion that federal workers with disabilities may have been responsible for the crash “irresponsible, disparaging and wrong” and accused the president of using a tragedy to push his political agenda.', '“Disabled employees, like non-disabled employees, are hired because they meet the qualifications needed to do the job,” reads the statement signed by the American Association of People with Disabilities, the American Council of the Blind, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, the National Disability Rights Network and others. “Diversity hiring initiatives seek to expand the pool of potential qualified talent for a role — they do not supersede the qualifications and skills that the role requires.”', 'Advocates noted that many news reports suggested that there were staffing issues at the air traffic control tower at the time of the crash. Nonetheless, they said the White House has doubled down on people with disabilities, releasing a memo about aviation safety highlighting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives including those focused on recruitment of people with severe intellectual disabilities. Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office to do away with so-called DEI efforts in government.', '“There is no evidence that FAA hiring practices had anything to do with this accident, and suggesting otherwise is misleading and harmful,” said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States. “People with disabilities — like all federal employees — are hired because of their qualifications, skills and ability to do a job. In moments like this, we should be focused on facts and supporting those affected, not pointing fingers at an entire community.”', 'Katherine Macfarlane, associate professor of law and the director of Disability Law and Policy Program at Syracuse University’s College of Law, said Trump’s comments could having lasting effects for a population that already struggles to get ahead.', '“Working-age people with disabilities remain disproportionately underemployed, and false stereotypes about people with disabilities keep Americans who are ready and willing to work out the workforce,” said Macfarlane. “Suggesting that people with disabilities are to blame for the tragic plane crash near Reagan National Airport, as a result of DEIA-focused hiring efforts at the FAA, perpetuate harmful, false stereotypes, and frustrate disabled peoples’ efforts to obtain gainful employment and contribute to the economy.”', '', '', ""Read more stories like this one.

Only the highest aptitude. They have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers.

It was an irresponsible move by the president, blaming the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden (omitting that he served a term between them) without any evidence that a person of color, someone from the LBGQ+ community, a woman, or a person with a disability were involved with the crash. And it came just days after Trump issued an executive order ending affirmative action in federal contracting, and ending federal DEI programs from anti-bias training to funds for farmers and homeowners.

McGee also discusses the dangerous politicization of the FAA and the increasing influence of Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, over the aviation industry.', 'AMY GOODMAN: During a White House press briefing Thursday, President Trump said the cause of Wednesday’s midair collision of a U.S. military helicopter with an American passenger jet at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people is still unknown, but Trump proceeded to blame, without evidence, Democrats and federal workplace DEI initiatives for the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in more than two decades.', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My administration will set the highest possible bar for aviation safety. We have to have our smartest people. It doesn’t matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are. It matters intellect, talent. The word “talent.” They have to be talented, naturally talented, geniuses. You can’t have regular people doing that job. They won’t be able to do it. But we’ll restore faith in American air travel. I’ll have more to say about that.', 'I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office — and here’s one: “The FAA’s diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.” That is amazing. And then it says, ”FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce.” So they want them in, and they want them — they can be air traffic controllers. I don’t think so. This was on January 14th, so that was a week before I entered office. They put a big push to put diversity into the FAA’s program.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Trump was reading from a year-old online report about efforts at the FAA to hire people with disabilities. During the news conference, journalists repeatedly questioned Trump about his unfounded assertions. This is one exchange with New York Times reporter David Sanger.', 'DAVID SANGER: Mr. President, you have today blamed the diversity element, but then told us that you weren’t sure that the controllers made any mistake. You then said perhaps the helicopter pilots were the ones — ', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.', 'DAVID SANGER: — who made the mistake.', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It’s all under investigation.', 'DAVID SANGER: I understand that. That’s why I’m trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash.', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK?', 'AMY GOODMAN: During Thursday’s news conference, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth echoed Donald Trump’s attacks on diversity.', 'DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH: We will have the best and brightest in every position possible — as you said in your inaugural, it is colorblind and merit-based — the best leaders possible, whether it’s flying Black Hawks and flying airplanes, leading platoons or in government. The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department, and we need the best and brightest, whether it’s in our air traffic control or whether it’s in our generals or whether it’s throughout government.', 'AMY GOODMAN: During Thursday’s press conference, Vice President JD Vance echoed Trump’s attacks on DEI.', 'VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: When you don’t have the best standards in who you’re hiring, it means, on the one hand, you’re not getting the best people in government, but, on the other hand, it puts stresses on the people who are already there. And I think that is a core part of what President Trump is going to bring and has already brought to Washington, D.C., is we want to hire the best people, because we want the best people in air traffic control, and we want to make sure we have enough people in air traffic control who are actually competent to do the job. If you go back to just some of the headlines over the past 10 years, you have many hundreds of people suing the government because they would like to be air traffic controllers but they were turned away because of the color of their skin. That policy ends under Donald Trump’s leadership, because safety is the first priority of our aviation industry.', 'AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by Bill McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at American Economic Liberties Project. As an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher, he spent seven years in airline flight operations management and is the author of Attention All Passengers: The Airlines’ Dangerous Descent — and How to Reclaim Our Skies. He teaches at Vaughn College of Aeronautics. Bill McGee’s new piece for Frommer’s is headlined “The Big Lie of Aviation DEI.”', 'Now, I want to point out, Bill, that you wrote this piece not in response to the news conference at the White House, but before the White House news conference and before the crash. Can you talk about what’s going on here? President Trump, when asked about any other issue, said, “Well, the investigation has to continue,” but he still blamed the crash on DEI.', 'WILLIAM McGEE: Yes, you’re right. The fact is that these rumors, which are unfounded, have been swirling around aviation for more than 20 years, but they are not based in fact. That’s why I wrote what I wrote in Frommer’s the other day. That was, again, as you pointed out, you know, the day before the crash. But it’s not as if what we heard this week we haven’t heard before. And it’s simply unfounded. As you just pointed out, these rumors are not at all based in fact.', 'What the DEI initiatives at the FAA — and at other agencies, as well, but specifically at the FAA — what they were meant to do was to broaden the pool of recruitment for positions. But this needs to be said in all caps, in bold. The fact is, there has not been a loosening of standards. The same standards have to to apply, in terms of testing — you know, when I was licensed as an FAA dispatcher, we had a written test, we had an oral test, we had an eight-hour practical exam. All of those things are still in place. No one is going into safety critical jobs without being prepared.', ""AMY GOODMAN: Bill McGee, Trump blamed Biden. He blamed Obama. He blamed Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary. He said, “They actually came out with a directive: 'too white.' And we want the people that are competent,” he said. They kept talking about “the best and the brightest,” not to be confused with “the best and the whitest.” If you can comment on this and the history of this, where his certainty comes from? He says it’s just common sense, yet presented absolutely no evidence."", 'WILLIAM McGEE: Well, I think we need to step back a moment and look at the bigger picture with what is really going on here. We have an aviation industry in crisis, and we’ve had that for several years now, at the FAA, at Boeing, at the airlines. And for every minute that we spend talking about DEI, we’re not talking about so many other critical issues.', 'FAA safety inspectors, they have been understaffed for 40 years. It’s not just a matter of throwing money at these problems, but the FAA needs to be realigned. Since the Reagan administration, it has not kept pace with the industry. And, you know, we can go through a long list of problems that are not being addressed by this.', 'And every time I hear this, DEI — that’s why I wrote the column I wrote — the DEI issue, in my view, it’s a distraction. I mean, for those that are serious about aviation safety, they know we have a long laundry list of problems that need to be addressed, with air traffic control, with maintenance outsourcing, with the oversight of the airlines, the oversight of Boeing. And instead, we’re talking about a nonsensical issue that is not based in fact.', 'AMY GOODMAN: After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the White House issued an executive order titled “Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation” that rescinds all diversity, equity and inclusion hiring programs at the FAA. I want to turn to Rick Larsen, ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, criticizing the executive order in a statement, saying, quote, “Hiring air traffic controllers is the number one safety issue according to the entire aviation industry. Instead of working to improve aviation safety and lower costs for hardworking American families, the Administration is choosing to spread bogus DEI claims to justify this decision.” And you have, Bill, The New York Times reporting, and others, that it looks like the Black Hawk helicopter, with the three, and usually it’s supposed to be four people, soldiers inside, being off the actual route and too high.', 'WILLIAM McGEE: Yeah, you’re right. And I think Representative Larsen is correct, as well. We have had an air traffic controller shortage in this country for several years now. These issues cross political lines, by the way. They go back years and years. And the pipeline, it actually improved under Secretary Buttigieg and President Biden. We started seeing more air traffic controllers come online. But we do not have enough.', 'And when you look at what happened the other night in the Potomac River — I know that airport very, very well, DCA, because when I was working in airline flight operations, I worked for the Northeast Shuttle, so I dealt with DCA, dispatching flights there every day of the week. And I can tell you it’s one of the most challenging airports in the country. And we need the absolute full staffing of air traffic control at DCA and at airports all across the country. We’re not there.', 'The irony here is that for all the knock on DEI, it’s about doing that. It’s about broadening the net of trying to attract more people into aviation, people that traditionally were not drawn to aviation. You mentioned I teach at Vaughn College of Aeronautics. It happens to be the most diverse student body of any college in the country. And I see it all the time. We’re sending more and more people into aviation who wouldn’t before.', 'So, you know, we need to get rid of the rumors, that are unfounded, about the safety question, and we need to start doing things to improve the system, including staffing, staffing at the FAA on the air traffic control side and staffing at the FAA on the safety inspector side. We all know that Boeing is a mess. This was once probably the greatest corporation in this country. And why is it a mess? Well, in large measure, it’s because the FAA hasn’t been able to inspect it. They have something called the designee system, that allows Boeing employees to be the eyes and ears of the FAA. Imagine that. Imagine having to tell your boss that you need to shut down the assembly line. You’re a mid-level manager, and your mortgage is riding on this. It’s a system that really needs to be revamped from top to bottom.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, the crash comes as the Federal Aviation Administration is lacking an administrator, though Trump just named one. But it was lacking an FAA administrator after Elon Musk pressured Mike Whitaker to announce his early resignation in December. Musk was furious with Whitaker after the FAA fined Musk’s SpaceX over $600,000 for safety violations on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Musk has also accused the FAA of slowing development of its experimental Starship rocket. Earlier this month, the FAA grounded Starship after a test vehicle caught fire, veered off course and exploded high above the Caribbean, the disaster triggering massive sonic booms as fiery debris reentered the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, littering the Turks and Caicos with rocket parts and forcing airlines to divert dozens of flights. So, the richest man in the world forces the head of the FAA out, and now, just after the crash, Trump names a new FAA administrator, Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year veteran of the agency. Can you respond to Musk and what you know about the new FAA head?', 'WILLIAM McGEE: Yeah, you raise a great question, you know, because about 15 years ago, the FAA Reauthorization Act in Congress specifically changed the parameters so that the FAA administrator term would be five years. And the clear intent there was that aviation safety is so critical that it should rise above politics, and that a five-year term would guarantee that an administrator would be in office during any kind of a presidential transition from one party to another, from one president to another.', 'Well, we didn’t see that happen, right? Michael Whitaker was in office only for a little more than a year. He should have been in office for five years. And he was removed on Inauguration Day. As you say, all of the media reports indicate this was because of Musk and because of Whitaker coming down on his company. This is not how the system is supposed to work. Aviation safety should be above politics.', 'And unfortunately, for decades now, we have seen not administrators, but acting administrators. That’s what we have seen in the first Trump administration. You know, you’ll recall the two fatal Boeing 737 MAX accidents. It wasn’t until after the second accident, in early 2019, that it was as if the administration woke up and said, “Oh, we don’t have an FAA administrator.” Now, I know there are those that are going to say an acting administrator is almost as good as an administrator. It’s not the case. Yes, they can run the day-to-day, and they can deal with crises, and they can, you know, put out whatever fires are burning that day. But they do not have the ability to look at long-term issues, including staffing. And so, we have to start treating this more seriously. A permanent FAA administrator needs to be in place at all times.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, you have right now — yeah, he may be the richest man in the world, not to be glib, but the guy who keeps blowing up rockets is now influencing airline safety policy.', 'WILLIAM McGEE: Yeah, it’s a very dangerous situation. There’s no two ways about it. Again, you know, the FAA used to be called the gold standard for a government agency overseeing aviation. Other nations, when they had problems, when they had accidents, that weren’t even in any way related to the United States, not involving a U.S.-built aircraft, not involving a U.S. airline, they would turn to the FAA and the NTSB and ask for assistance. We are no longer the gold standard. It’s just that simple. We have seen it in recent years when other countries have said, “No, we’ll do without the FAA on this investigation,” particularly after the Boeing MAX crashes. This is not how to run the FAA, to have someone like Elon Musk come in and make these decisions.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Bill McGee, I want to thank you for being with us, senior fellow for aviation and travel at American Economic Liberties Project, an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher. We’re going to link to your new piece for Frommer’s titled — for Frommer’s, “The Big Lie of Aviation DEI.” Bill McGee was editor-in-chief of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, and he is the author of Attention All Passengers.', 'Coming up next, Samoa, where experts blame RFK Jr.’s campaign against vaccines for a deadly measles outbreak in 2019.

We aggressively fight against negligent defendants and pursue compensation for the victims and families of plane accidents and other aviation crashes. We thoroughly investigate and expose aviation accident causes.', 'To find out why planes crash in our cases, our aviation attorneys use a team of investigators and leading experts to inspect and analyze every aspect of an aviation accident, including what happened before the flight, what happened in the moments leading up to the accident, and what happened as the accident was unfolding. We assess corporate policies that may have impacted actions of those involved, listen to evidence preserved in the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) and analyze the salvaged remains of the aircraft to ensure all possible air crash causes are checked. After our investigation is complete, we pursue personal injury and wrongful death claims under product, airline, pilot, controller, or other liability theories as appropriate.', 'Over the past decades, our experience handling aviation accidents has provided us with comprehensive understanding of the many common reasons why planes crash.', 'Below are some of the most frequently reported aviation accident causes:', 'Contact us at (855) 948-5098 or submit our online form to get started with a free consultation.', 'Aircraft and airports operate under two different rules or systems, mostly depending on the weather. Essentially, when weather and visibility are good, aircraft are permitted to operate under visual flight rules (VFR). When weather and visibility are bad, aircraft are required to operate under instrument flight rules (IFR). The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sets exact guidelines as to when each system is to be used.', 'When an airplane comes in for a landing, it follows what is called a glide path. The standard glide path is 3 degrees up from the runway touchdown zone, and makes for a smooth transition from regular flight to landing. It is called a glide path because in the early days of aviation most airplanes would glide in for a landing using little or no power.', 'Many airports, including most that handle airline traffic, have landing aids that assist the pilot in setting up the aircraft on the proper glide path/slope. Some landing aids are designed for use in VFR conditions and some are designed for IFR conditions.', 'VASI (Visual Approach Slope Indicator) is a system of lights used to aid the pilot in landing. It consists of bars of red and white lights that tell the pilot whether the aircraft is on, above, or below the glide path. If all lights are red the aircraft is below the glide path, a combination of red and white indicates on the glide path, and all white tells the pilot that the aircraft is above the glide path. VASI will guide the pilot down to about 200 feet above the ground, and to continue landing, the runway must be clearly visible.', 'PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) is a newer and more precise light system that operates in a similar fashion as VASI. A system of red and white lights tell the pilot where he is in relation to the glide path. PAPI is much more precise than VASI, hence the name, and is accurate to about 50 feet above the runway. This enables the pilot to fly almost down to a landing using the system.', 'The diagram, shows the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) system of lights. These lights will be seen by pilots beside the runway as the plane approaches to land. As can be seen, if all the lights are white, the plane is above the glide path; if the lights are all red, the plane is below the glide path. Two red and two white lights indicate the plane is right where it should be on the glide path. Other formations of the lights are found, but this diagram describes the principal type of visual aid the pilots have with the PAPI system.', 'When using an instrument approach, or when visibility is poor, the ILS (Instrument Landing System) may be used to aid the pilot in making a safe landing. ILS is a radio system with components on the ground and in the aircraft. The localizer part of ILS will tell the pilot whether the aircraft is lined up straight with the runway, or to the right or left. The glide slope part of the ILS indicates to the pilot whether the aircraft is higher, lower than or properly on the glide path. Thus ILS is an accurate guide for the pilot down the glide path. An approach to landing using this system is called an ILS approach.', 'When an approach to landing is done using the ILS, the ILS can be and often is used with VASI or PAPI light systems as a cross check. The pilot flies the ILS approach until he can see the lights of the VASI or PAPI system, and uses both systems for final approach and landing.', 'The ILS can be used for a precision approach even in good weather with fine visibility. But an excellent approach and landing can be made in VFR (Visual Flight Rules) conditions without using either VASI, PAPI, the glide slope or the localizer.', 'The fact is that most every commercial flight is conducted IFR because of the altitude that these aircraft are flying. IFR flight is necessary for navigation at high altitudes. However, IFR flying is generally used all the way through the landing phase. Having said that, as has been discussed in the media, commercial airline pilots must be comfortable landing these aircraft using VFR rules and the associated systems.', 'Also, interestingly, airplanes still land with little or no “power” now and are, in a sense, gliding in. But, there is a need to have power available if needed. Power is used to adjust the airplane’s altitude during the landing phase to keep it on the glide path; i.e. utilizing small power adjustments as they probably did in the early days of aviation. With piston engines, getting additional power is nearly instantaneous with an advance of the throttle. With jet engines, however, one must “spool up” the engines in order to have available to the crew any needed power adjustments, and that process takes as much as 10 seconds, or so. That is why pilots of jets should not attempt to “glide” in with the engines at flight idle all the way to touchdown.', 'Call (855) 948-5098 or fill out our online form today to schedule a free consultation.', '', '', '', '', '', 'We believe our track record speaks for itself.

So we don’t know,"" Trump told reporters, according to the Associated Press.', ""Trump pointed to a Federal Aviation Administration program to hire people with disabilities, which was put in place in 2013 and remained policy throughout Trump's first term, and an ongoing class-action lawsuit. That lawsuit, Brigida v. the United States Department of Transportation, alleges discrimination in the admissions process for air traffic controllers."", ""An investigation into what caused the crash is ongoing, and there is no evidence that DEI initiatives played any role so far.

Trump steamrolls every principle of aviation safety in wild news conference,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/politics/analysis-trump-news-conference-dc-plane-crash/index.html,"['', 'There is a good reason why American commercial airliners have safely flown billions of miles since the last major tragedy.', 'Every incident, near miss or accident is minutely investigated, without rushed conclusions, political bias or uninformed speculation. The result is an industry based on multiple layers of redundancy, faithfully followed safety protocols, pilot checklists and codes of practice that have made the unnatural business of humans taking to the skies safer than climbing into a car.', 'President Donald Trump on Thursday ignored all those principles when addressing the disaster in Washington’s crowded skies the night before, in one of the most staggering spectacles in the White House briefing room since his last term.', 'In his first national crisis since reassuming the presidency, he put his political goals and need for adulation above the need to find untainted answers about the catastrophe and over the indescribable pain of victims’ families.', 'Trump’s approach highlighted his determination to break the mold of every other modern president and to prioritize what he called “common sense” over traditional expertise in government — to now include air accident investigations. But his appearance also underscored a fundamental question raised by his second term: whether his impulse to be a disrupter may sometimes be counterproductive and even jeopardize the well-being of Americans.', 'After reading a written statement bemoaning the loss of more than 60 passengers on the American Airlines jet and the three personnel on an Army helicopter, Trump switched from calling for national unity to stirring division.', '“In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all, both as Americans and even as nations,” Trump said, in a moving statement that spoke to his potential as a healer at times of national stress.', 'But moments later, he switched from the time-honored presidential role of offering consolation and comfort to dishing out partisanship and speculation.', '“I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first, and they put politics at a level that nobody’s ever seen, because this was the lowest level,” Trump said.', 'With bodies still being pulled from the Potomac, Trump blamed diversity hiring in the air traffic control industry for the crash and said it was due to former President Joe Biden’s policies. He profanely slandered the last administration’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg — a potential future Democratic presidential candidate.', '“We have to have our smartest people. It doesn’t matter what they look like, how they speak, who they are,” Trump said. “It matters — intellect, talent. The word ‘talent’ — you have to be talented, naturally talented geniuses.” And referring to air traffic controllers, he said: “You can’t have regular people doing that job.”', 'Trump did not provide evidence that diversity hiring practices had caused the crash. And as he often does, he offered a caveat that gives him plausible deniability that his allies can point to and accuse opponents and reporters who highlight his various outlandish claims of misinterpreting what he said. “It just could have been,” he said, openly admitting he couldn’t prove what he said.', '“Certainly, for an air traffic controller, we want the brightest, the smartest, the sharpest. We want somebody that’s psychologically superior, and that’s what we’re going to have,” Trump said. In the context of his earlier remarks, his comment implied that only White males are suitable for keeping planes in the sky.', 'Investigations of Wednesday’s crash will examine every aspect of the accident, including the instructions given by controllers, the staffing in the Reagan National Airport control tower and at approach control, the actions of the pilots, the safety procedures in place and the potential complications of one of the busiest airspaces in the country. The spate of near misses and almost accidents — especially on airport runways in recent years and months — is spreading fear among the public.', 'There may also be a case for probing air traffic control hiring and retention practices. One of the reasons why Trump was elected last year was that his criticisms of diversity hiring practices resonated with some Americans.', 'Trump’s instinct to give a full and frank picture into what happened on Thursday could have been a breath of fresh air, had he stuck to the facts.', '“We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we’ll probably state those opinions now because over the years, I’ve watched as things like this happen, and they say, ‘Well, we’re always investigating,’ and then, the investigation three years later, they announce it,” he said.', 'The president is right that limited information flow after disasters and technical reports issued years later often don’t give Americans the respect they deserve in making their own transportation decisions. And Biden’s inability to project authority did in recent years sometimes leave an impression that no one was in command.', 'But Trump’s performance only succeeded in establishing immediate and baseless conclusions as to what caused the crash, added layers of speculation that will hamper public understanding of the investigation’s conclusions and injected grieving family members immediately into the heat of a raging political controversy.', 'And by using the power of presidential rhetoric, he has also created a huge problem for official investigators who speak in public about the crash and may now have to issue statements that conflict with the commander in chief’s position — which could put their jobs and the integrity of the probe in danger.', 'It was notable that Trump did not appear with experts at his news conference. Instead, he was joined by a succession of laymen with no in-depth experience of commercial or military aviation whose prime function seemed to be to shower praise on his leadership and to push his anti-diversity talking points.', '“I would just note the president’s leadership has been remarkable during this crisis,” newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. “We will not accept passing the buck,” he said, moments after Trump assigned full blame for the accident.', 'Former Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth, who just became Defense secretary, praised Trump for his “leadership and courage” and pledged that “we will have the best and brightest in every position possible. … It is colorblind and merit-based, the best leaders possible, whether it’s flying Black Hawks and flying airplanes.”', 'Like Trump, Hegseth left the impression that minorities and women may not be suitable for such positions. But he did not address the key issue known to all Washingtonians — the massive levels of military aircraft often flying to and from the Pentagon and other nearby military facilities that operate near Reagan National Airport’s runways.', 'Vice President JD Vance, also appearing at the briefing room podium, praised Trump’s “leadership” and made similar points about diversity hiring.', 'No one from the National Transportation Safety Board — normally the lead agency on such occasions — appeared to answer questions from reporters. This fit a pattern from his first term in which Trump preferred his own “common sense” over expertise — especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The most obvious instance of this trend was in April 2020 when the president, at the same podium, wondered aloud, to the horror of his medical experts, whether disinfectant “by injection inside or almost a cleaning” could be used to treat the lungs of coronavirus patients.', 'Alan Diehl, a former NTSB investigator, said that the agency had long been one of the most independent in the US government.', '“We will see if that continues in the new administration,” Diehl told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “The NTSB has stood proudly and tall and called it as they saw it and that is what Congress intended.”', 'Trump ended his briefing by assuring the public it’s safe to fly. Though anyone watching and listening to the previous half hour might wonder.', '“From the time I came in, we started going out and getting the best people because I said, ‘It’s not appropriate, what they’re doing. I think it’s a tremendous mistake,’” he said.', '“You know, they like to do things and they like to take them too far, and this is sometimes what ends up happening. Now, with that, I’m not blaming the controller, I’m saying there are things that you could question, like the height of the helicopter, the height of the plane, being at the same level and going in opposite directions. It’s not a positive.”', '“But no, flying is very safe. We have the safest flying anywhere in the world and we’ll keep it that way.”', '© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

When a reporter pressed him on how he could point to diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices as the reason for the crash, he shot back: “Because I have common sense.”', 'Americans have often turned to their leaders in times of tragedy, hoping they can help bind the nation’s wounds and somehow make sense out of events that are often senseless.', 'Ronald Reagan lauded the heroism of the doomed astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger, who were killed when the aircraft exploded shortly after takeoff in 1986. “We will never forget them,” he said during a televised address from the Oval Office, recalling how they prepared for their journey and “slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.”', ""Looking back:'Oh my God, no!' Space shuttle Challenger exploded 39 years ago"", 'After the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, George W.

The rest of the world hears you! And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.”', 'Barack Obama wiped away tears while he mourned the “beautiful little kids” gunned down during a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012. “These children are our children,” he said.', 'Trump, though, has at times offered a different approach to his role of comforter to a grief-stricken nation. During his first term, and at other times before he entered politics, Trump has used moments of national mourning to stress a political point, or to address his critics.', 'In 2016, during his first campaign for the White House, Trump slammed Obama after a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and wounding 53 others. Trump condemned Obama for not saying the words “radical Islam” and urged him to resign from office.', 'When 11 people were shot to death at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, Trump, by then well into his first term, appeared to suggest that fewer would have died if they’d had weapons or if an armed guard had been on hand. “If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation,” he said.', 'A year later, Trump marked the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks with somber expressions and political attacks. He started the morning by going on Twitter and posting a photo of himself and first lady Melania Trump appearing to reflect on the anniversary. “We Will Never Forget,” the caption read.', 'Ten minutes later, Trump launched into a Twitter criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he argued should lower interest rates, and against one of his perennial targets – the media – over a new poll that showed him losing in a hypothetical race against Hillary Clinton and other Democrats.', 'Then last week, just three days into his second term, Trump took aim at California as devastating wildfires ravaged the state.

No Evidence for the Political Finger-Pointing Over D.C. Plane Crash,https://www.factcheck.org/2025/01/no-evidence-for-the-political-finger-pointing-over-d-c-plane-crash/,"[""By Saranac Hale Spencer and D'Angelo Gore"", 'Posted on January 31, 2025', 'Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino.', 'After the deadly collision between a passenger plane and a U.S. Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., politicians and political commentators were quick to cast blame. President Donald Trump suggested diversity initiatives within the Federal Aviation Administration were at fault for the crash, and his critics pointed to a hiring freeze that Trump instituted on Jan. 20.', 'But neither side has evidence that those actions contributed to the crash.', 'The midair collision on Jan. 29 near Reagan Washington National Airport left no survivors. A total of 67 people reportedly died — 64 who were on the plane coming from Wichita, Kansas, and three soldiers who were in the helicopter.', 'The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into what caused the crash. In a press conference on Jan. 30, leaders stressed that the case was just beginning, and they had no answers yet.', 'At a press conference on Jan. 30, Trump told reporters, “We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions.”', 'The president then went on to suggest that diversity hiring programs were to blame. He referred to a memo he signed on Jan. 21, eight days before the crash, titled “Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation.”', 'The memo incorrectly attributed a long-standing policy of the FAA only to former President Joe Biden’s administration, saying that “the prior administration sought to specifically recruit and hire individuals with serious infirmities that could impact the execution of their essential life-saving duties.”', 'At the press conference, Trump, again, made the same claim. He read aloud a headline that had been published by the New York Post and Fox News a year earlier. The headline said, “The FAA’s diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities.” The president added, “They can be air traffic controllers — I don’t think so.”', 'That story was published in January 2024, following an incident in Oregon when an emergency exit door flew off of a Boeing 737 while it was in flight. Trump wrongly indicated that the story was published in January 2025, weeks before he took office.', 'The Fox News story had linked to a page on the FAA website about diversity and inclusion initiatives that had been active since at least 2013, according to the Internet Archive, and as Snopes discovered last year. Notably, that page had also been active — and carried the same language — through Trump’s first administration.', '“The initiative is part of the FAA’s Diversity and Inclusion hiring plan, which says diversity is integral to achieving FAA’s mission of ensuring safe and efficient travel,” Trump read at the press conference, adding: “I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I think it’s just the opposite.”', 'Citing the FAA website, Trump said the federal government had identified certain disabilities “for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,” saying they included “hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis” and more. All of that language was on the FAA’s website during Trump’s first term.', 'The Washington Post Fact Checker also noted that during Trump’s first administration, in 2019, the FAA announced a new program “to help prepare people with disabilities for careers in air traffic operations.”', 'In his Jan. 21 memo, however, the president said that “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring … penalizes hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.”', 'At the press conference, when a reporter asked Trump why he thought the reason for the crash was diversity among air traffic controllers, the president said, “Because I have common sense.”', 'Later on Jan. 30, a reporter asked if Trump was saying that “race or gender played a role in this tragedy.” Trump said: “It may have. I don’t know. Incompetence might have played a role. We’ll let you know that, but we want the most competent people. We don’t care what race they are. We want the most competent people especially in those positions.”', 'Meanwhile, on social media, some critics of Trump are claiming or suggesting — also without proof — that he is the one responsible for the deadly crash.', 'An account belonging to Trill Clinton, whose bio says he worked for the Department of Housing and Urban and Development during the Obama administration, published a Jan. 30 post on X saying, “You dont get to: 1. Fire the head of the TSA, and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. 2. Freeze hiring of all Air Traffic Controllers. 3. Fire 100 top FAA security officers. And then claim a plane crash a week later is ‘a tragic accident.’”', 'Sawyer Hackett, a democratic strategist and consultant, similarly wrote on X, “If a Democrat fired 100 FAA employees and put a freeze on hiring air traffic controllers 8 days before an airport plane crash, there would be a right-wing and media frenzy for weeks.” In another post, Hackett said, “The plane crash in DC was Trump’s fault.”', 'But there is no evidence that any recent executive actions taken by Trump played a role in the incident.', 'On his first day back in office as president, Trump did sign an executive order putting a temporary freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees.', '“As part of this freeze, no Federal civilian position that is vacant at noon on January 20, 2025, may be filled, and no new position may be created except as otherwise provided for in this memorandum or other applicable law,” the order said.', 'However, the order also said that the hiring freeze does not apply to “military personnel of the armed forces or to positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety.” The White House told us in an email that the freeze did not apply to air traffic control specialists because of the public safety exemption. A spokesperson also said that no air traffic controllers were fired.', 'On Jan. 30, the New York Times, citing an internal FAA report on safety, reported that staffing at Reagan National Airport’s air traffic control tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.” But an Associated Press source later contradicted that FAA report, telling the AP that staffing was normal the night of Jan. 29.', 'But the Reagan airport tower “has been understaffed for years” and “was nearly a third below targeted staff levels,” as of September 2023, the Times said in its report.', 'It’s also true that after he took office, Trump removed the heads of the Transportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard and eliminated members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee — although it’s not clear that those decisions had a direct connection to the Jan. 29 crash, either.', 'In a story addressing claims that Trump is at fault, PolitiFact quoted Jim Cardoso, a former U.S. Air Force colonel and pilot who directs the University of South Florida’s Global and National Security Institute, as saying that “the actions by President Trump would not have led to such an immediate impact.”', 'Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Donald Trump’s Anti-Woke Wrecking Ball,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/02/10/donald-trumps-anti-woke-wrecking-ball,"['On the Wednesday evening of a Washington week defined by a blitzkrieg of executive orders, vituperative confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Kash Patel, and Tulsi Gabbard, and an effort by the new President to suspend much of the federal budget, an American Airlines jet approaching Washington, D.C., from Wichita collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Reagan National Airport. Everyone on board both aircraft was killed, sixty-seven people in total, some of them young ice-skaters. The next day, President Trump called a press conference. He began by expressing his condolences and described the “icy, icy Potomac—it was a cold, cold night, cold water.” He then said, “We do not know what led to this crash,” but, he added, “we have very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we’ll probably state those opinions now.”', 'That statement could be a motto for this Administration, but what Trump meant in this case was that diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration had somehow caused the calamity. It is essential, Trump said, that air-traffic controllers be hired for their “intellect, talent—the word ‘talent,’ ” but, instead, the Democrats “came out with a directive: too white.” (He also complained about Pete Buttigieg—Joe Biden’s Transportation Secretary and an occasional liberal antagonist on Fox News, who is reportedly considering a run for the U.S. Senate in Michigan—claiming, “He’s just got a good line of bullshit.”) Apparently quoting old reports in the New York Post and from Fox News, Trump listed conditions that he implied the F.A.A. had been giving preference to in its hiring practices—including “severe intellectual disability,” “psychiatric disability,” and “dwarfism.”', 'Trump offered no evidence that diversity had anything to do with the crash and, at other points, seemed to place the blame for it on the pilot of the Black Hawk. (Helicopters have “the ability to go up or down,” Trump noted.)

Throughout the government, new appointees have been touting their reversals of diversity standards—the signal feature of what has been a rapid two-week effort to remake the preëxisting bureaucracy with an America First agenda. Sometimes the appointees have simply swapped in preferences for their favored groups: an order issued by Sean Duffy, the new Secretary of Transportation—who is a former congressman and reality-TV star and the father of nine—requires his agency to give preference in the awarding of contracts to communities with high marriage and birth rates; an order banning D.E.I. initiatives in the military requires the service academies to “teach that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”', 'In other instances, there has been a more general anti-idealism: a stop-work order issued by the Administration suspended the pepfar program, which supplies H.I.V. medication, largely in sub-Saharan Africa, and has saved an estimated twenty-six million lives. Foreign aid, the order argues, is “not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values.”', 'The new Administration has been moving fast and operating almost exclusively by executive order—Trump seems largely uninterested in Congress, and his Inaugural Address offered barely any legislative agenda. (Congressional Republicans, of course, remain highly invested in Trump; they held a retreat last week at his golf club in Doral, Florida, where the President’s name had been scorched onto the hamburger buns.) When, on Monday, Trump’s Office of Management and Budget published a memo ordering federal agencies to “identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities” to be sure that they reflected “administration priorities” and not “wokeness,” it fell to the Democrats to point out that a President has no authority to suspend legally authorized congressional spending. Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, called the suspension a “constitutional crisis,” and, if it wasn’t obviously that, it also wasn’t obviously not that.', 'By the O.M.B.’s own accounting, some three trillion dollars of the government’s ten-trillion-dollar annual expenditures was subject to the freeze—seemingly affecting programs such as Meals on Wheels and Head Start and even scientific research—and the White House appeared a little fuzzy as to where the list stopped. Trump’s new press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, was asked whether the seventy-two million Americans who rely on Medicaid were guaranteed their health insurance. Across the country, portals were down. “I’ll check back on that and get back to you,” she said. Perhaps that was a step too far. A federal judge issued an order pausing the freeze, and the next day the O.M.B. put out a very brief update rescinding the memo—but, Leavitt insisted, not the policy.', 'Was Trump just “weaving” when he used a press conference following a horrific plane crash to rant about diversity initiatives, or was he getting his Administration back on an anti-woke message, after overreaching in withholding federal funds? The smart money is on the latter. For all the glee and the diligence with which its staffers have tried to upend the liberal regime, they haven’t bothered to replace it with anything beyond a sour anti-principle. An agenda that casts doubt even momentarily on a basic social program like Medicaid can’t honestly be said to be either populist or “America First”; and Trump’s vows to install a government based on merit were undermined by his roster of clearly unqualified nominees. The operating credo at the outset of the Trump Administration has a transactional, Tammany Hall logic: there is no rule except power.', 'At Thursday’s press conference, after musing about the “high standard” he’d maintained when hiring air-traffic controllers in his first term, Trump said, “There are things where you have to go by brainpower, you have to go by psychological quality, and psychological quality is a very important element of it.” For air-traffic controllers and Presidents both. ♦', 'Has an old Soviet mystery finally been solved?', 'Why the rules of mustard and spaghetti sauce don’t apply to ketchup.', 'How the Unabomber avoided the death penalty.', 'The actress who magnified her celebrity by suddenly renouncing it.', 'The shareable feast of Jeremy Allen White’s Calvin Klein ad.', 'Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: “Girl”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90, its fuselage encrusted with ice, failed to gain altitude after taking off from DCA during a snowstorm, clipped vehicles on Washington’s 14th Street Bridge, and crashed into the river, killing 74. That was a dicey event for Reagan, for the DCA control tower was understaffed that day due to his recent firing of more than 11,000 members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) for staging an illegal strike—a walkout waged in part over safety and long workdays.

By citing Skutnik’s heroism, Reagan effectively shielded himself from any blame. That shrewd move inaugurated a political tradition: Every president since then has basked in the reflected glow of everyday American heroes strategically placed in the gallery for that purpose.', 'If Reagan avoided accountability in part by lifting up Skutnik, Trump’s graceless blamecasting seems less likely to divert attention from his own culpability.

But it’s also worth noting that some of Trump’s specific assertions about the FAA’s push to hire people with disabilities were either inaccurate or missing critical context about what happened during Trump’s own first presidency.', 'At one point, Trump read from a 2024 New York Post article that said the FAA was “actively recruiting workers who suffer ‘severe intellectual’ disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website.” And after reading out part of a 2024 Fox News article on the same subject, Trump said, “This was (on) January 14, so that was a week before I entered office; they put a big push to put diversity into the FAA’s program.”', 'Here are four important facts related to Trump’s claim.', 'Trump falsely claimed the Fox News article was from a week before he entered office: The “January 14” Fox News article Trump cited was, like the New York Post article, actually published on January 14 of last year – not, as Trump claimed, a week before he returned to the presidency in January of this year. In other words, the articles are not evidence that the Biden administration made a frantic last-minute FAA diversity push right before Trump took office again.', 'The Trump-era FAA had the same language on its website: The FAA’s language encouraging the hiring of people with disabilities, including intellectual and psychiatric disabilities, was featured on the agency’s website throughout Trump’s first presidency and at least as far back as 2013, as the fact-check website Snopes has previously reported. You can click here for the version of the web page captured by the Internet Archive in December 2020, the last full month of Trump’s first term.', 'The Trump-era FAA also pushed to hire people with disabilities: The federal government passed a law in 1973 that aimed to increase federal hiring of qualified people with disabilities. Like other government agencies, the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, had pushed since at least the George W. Bush administration to increase its hiring of people with certain “targeted disabilities” that create extra barriers to employment. Those include not only intellectual and psychiatric disabilities, but also deafness, blindness, paralysis and missing extremities.', 'The FAA under the first Trump administration also tried to increase hiring of people with targeted disabilities.', 'The FAA’s Aviation Safety Workforce Plan for the 2020-2029 period, issued under Trump, said the FAA’s Office of Aviation Safety would, in the 2020 fiscal year, “continue to promote and support the hiring of people with disabilities and targeted disabilities.”', 'Also during Trump’s first term, in 2019, the FAA announced “a pilot program to help prepare people with disabilities for careers in air traffic operations,” saying that “a key focus for the FAA’s Office of Civil Rights is to identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce.” The FAA continued to promote the pilot program in the latter half of 2020, near the end of Trump’s first term.', 'The FAA’s 2019 and 2020 descriptions of the program emphasized that people with disabilities would not be hired for jobs for which they weren’t capable. The FAA wrote in 2019 that “the candidates in this program will receive the same rigorous consideration in terms of aptitude, medical and security qualifications as those individuals considered for a standard public opening for air traffic controller jobs.”', 'That’s similar to what the Biden-era FAA told Fox News for the 2024 article Trump cited: “The FAA employs tens of thousands of people for a wide range of positions, from administrative roles to oversight and execution of critical safety functions. Like many large employers, the agency proactively seeks qualified candidates from as many sources as possible, all of whom must meet rigorous qualifications that of course will vary by position.”', 'The hiring of people with targeted disabilities is a small fraction of overall FAA hiring: The agency’s annual goal for hiring people with targeted disabilities has generally been in the vicinity of 2%. In the 2016 fiscal year under then-President Barack Obama, for example, the FAA said it had exceeded a 2.33% goal by hiring 89 people with targeted disabilities out of 3,373 total hires, a rate of about 2.64%.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

That they’re driven by safety, and DEI doesn’t matter?', 'On Face the Nation, Brian Mast, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, added “lifestyle” minorities to the list of dangerous hires:', 'Yes, there were very real errors that took place, both in the air-traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But more systemically: Is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that’s the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle . . .', 'For the record, the only transportation secretary who didn’t preside over a fatal air crash in this century was the one who’s openly gay. But when you’re peddling prejudice, facts don’t matter.', 'THE FIRST TWO WEEKS of this administration have been so packed with assaults on the Constitution and the rule of law—political purges at the FBI and other agencies, usurpations of congressional authority, delegations of vast official power to an unelected oligarch, mass pardons for people who beat up police to overturn an election—that an episode like this one, which might have sparked outrage in a calmer time, can seem small by comparison.', 'But it matters. One hallmark of fascism is the scapegoating of minorities. Trump did it a decade ago when he called for a ban on Muslims. Now he’s doing it again as he blames DEI for our country’s problems, even a plane crash. He’s testing America’s appetite not just for purging illegal immigrants, but for blunt racial prejudice. And he’s got a whole party behind him.', 'Send this article to a friend or family member or post it to social media:', 'Share', '', 'Tens of thousands of paid subscribers', 'Analysis and reporting on politics and culture in America.

Did Trump’s firing of aviation officials contribute to the D.C. crash? Experts say it’s unlikely,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/did-trumps-firing-of-aviation-officials-contribute-to-the-d-c-crash-experts-say-its-unlikely,"['', 'Louis Jacobson, PolitiFact', 'Loreben Tuquero, PolitiFact', 'Leave your feedback', 'This article originally appeared on PolitiFact.', 'Even as emergency responders were working to recover the remains of passengers and crew members who died in the Jan. 29 midair collision near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, social media users, especially critics of President Donald Trump, pointed to some of Trump’s policies as contributors to the crash.', '“Just last week, Trump FIRED the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee,” one X post read. The Associated Press reported Jan. 21 that Trump fired those heads and removed all members of the committee.', 'Another X post read, “On your 2ND DAY, you 1. Fired the head of the Transportation Security Administration, 2. Fired the entire Aviation Security Advisory Committee, 3. Froze hiring of all Air Traffic Controllers, 4. Fired 100 top FAA security officers.”', 'Trump in his first week in office did announce sweeping personnel changes, including a hiring freeze. But aviation experts said there was little that Trump did that could have precipitated the crash between a commercial jet from Wichita, Kansas, and a military Black Hawk helicopter. There was simply too little time — less than 10 days after Trump was sworn in — for any of his broadly worded executive orders to have had an effect, experts said.', 'WATCH: Breaking down the moments that led up to the worst U.S. aviation disaster since 2001', 'Although the Transportation Safety Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee all play roles in aviation safety, “the actions by President Trump would not have led to such an immediate impact,” said Jim Cardoso, a former U.S. Air Force colonel and pilot who is now senior director of the University of South Florida’s Global and National Security Institute.', '“All the processes to control and deconflict air traffic in the D.C. area have been well established for a long time,” Cardoso said. “The personnel involved in the accident — air crew from the two aircraft and the (air traffic controllers) in place at the time of the accident — would similarly not have been affected by” the recent policy changes in Trump’s executive orders since Jan. 20.', 'It’s also unwise to speculate on causes so soon after a crash, said John Cox, a retired pilot who runs a St. Petersburg, Florida-based aviation security consulting firm.', '“At this point, we don’t know enough,” Cox said Jan. 30. Anyone who argues that a specific factor caused the crash not even 24 hours after it happens is making an argument “without foundation,” he said.', 'Cox said the international standard for determining what caused a crash “is not to speculate. You stay with the facts. The idea is that it’s more important to get the right answer than a politically motivated answer.”', 'The investigation into the collision will likely take months. For now, here’s what we know about what actions Trump has taken related to aviation and what effect, if any, they could have had on this crash.', 'In a Jan. 20 executive order, Trump enacted a hiring freeze on federal civilian employees, stopping any open positions from being filled and any new positions from being created.', 'However, this order exempted military personnel, positions “related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety.” Air traffic control would be exempted from the hiring freeze because of its role in public safety, the White House told PolitiFact. The White House also said that, unlike political appointees, air traffic controllers do not change between administrations.', 'On Jan. 21, Trump signed the executive order, “Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation.” It eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, hiring and directed the transportation secretary and the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to “return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring.”', 'WATCH: Trump signs aviation order to assess ‘damage’ done to air safety by diversity policies', 'It also ordered performance reviews for “individuals in critical safety positions.”', 'Speaking to reporters Jan. 30, Trump blamed FAA diversity and inclusion hiring policies for the crash.', 'Cox said all the pilots and the air traffic controllers involved in the Jan. 29 crash would, by definition, have undergone the required training requirements and “met the standards to be in that job” and any adherence to DEI rules would not have changed that.', 'The New York Times reported Jan. 30 that staffing at the air traffic control tower was “not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,” according to an internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report. The Reagan airport tower has been understaffed for years, in part because of employee turnover and tight budgets, the Times reported.', 'Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported Jan. 21 that Trump had fired TSA Administrator David Pekoske and Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan.', 'However, the TSA’s safety responsibilities generally revolve around security screening of passengers, cargo and aviation workers, not the operation of planes. And the Coast Guard focuses on maritime security.', 'Trump also fired all members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a group that includes representatives of private-sector aviation groups. They advise the TSA administrator on aviation security. The group was scheduled to meet Feb. 26; it usually meets four times a year.', 'An X post claimed that Trump fired 400 “senior officials” of the Federal Aviation Administration and 3,000 air traffic controllers eight days ago. But this is unsubstantiated, and the White House told PolitiFact that no air traffic controllers had been fired.', 'In May 2024, CNN reported that, based on FAA numbers, air traffic control stations were facing a shortage of 3,000 controllers, with concerns that worker shortages were contributing to long shifts and exhaustion.', 'PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.', 'Left: An American Airlines plane departs the Ronald Reagan Washington National, in the aftermath of the collision of American Eagle flight 5342 and a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed into the Potomac River, with the Capitol dome in the background, as seen from Virginia, Feb. 1, 2025.
