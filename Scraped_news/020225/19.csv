Amnesty International calls on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians amid this devastating violence', 'On 27 January, the M23 declared that it had seized control of Goma, the DRC’s third-largest city, provincial capital of North-Kivu and home to nearly two million people. This development occurred despite the UN Secretary General’s call for Rwanda to withdraw its troops from the DRC and cease its support for the M23 fighters. Reports from the city described ongoing gunfire and explosions, alongside unverified reports on social media and by journalists of looting, indiscriminate shooting, and shelling in the city. The DRC government has not officially acknowledged losing control of Goma.', '“Thousands of Congolese civilians are once again fleeing for their lives, in desperate need of safety and humanitarian aid. Amnesty International calls on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians amid this devastating violence,” said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa.', 'Serious human rights violations, including killings of civilians, sexual violence, and the targeting of activists and human rights defenders, have often accompanied past conflicts in eastern DRC, such as during the M23’s takeover of Goma in 2012. Some of these violations could amount to war crimes when committed in armed conflict.', 'Humanitarian organizations, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, report that over 400,000 people were displaced in January due to the ongoing conflict in the region. Many sought refuge in and around Goma, a city that was already sheltering over 600,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs).', 'The M23, backed by Rwanda, must comply with international humanitarian law. They must ensure the safety of civilians, including human rights defenders and journalists, including those critical of Rwanda and the M23. They must also guarantee safe passage for fleeing civilians and allow and facilitate humanitarian access.', '“Civilians face a grave risk of human rights violations amid this latest escalation. Over the past year, both sides have ramped up their use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas, with devastating consequences for civilians. Neither side must deploy explosive weapons with wide-area effects into densely populated civilian areas, such as camps for IDPs,” said Tigere Chagutah.', '“The M23, backed by Rwanda, must comply with international humanitarian law. They must ensure the safety of civilians, including human rights defenders and journalists, including those critical of Rwanda and the M23. They must also guarantee safe passage for fleeing civilians and allow and facilitate humanitarian access.”', 'Reports from Rwandan media indicated that Rwanda has received several civilians seeking refuge, while others fled Goma to Bukavu, provincial capital of South Kivu, via Lake Kivu. Following the capture of Goma, the M23 ordered the suspension of all activities on the lake, which could hinder the movement of people fleeing the fighting in Goma. Certain areas of the city are without access to water and electricity, as the conflict has damaged critical infrastructure.', '“With thousands in and around Goma seeking shelter, food, water, sanitation and healthcare, the parties to the conflict must allow the passage of safe and unrestricted humanitarian access to all those in need,” said Tigere Chagutah.', 'On 18 January, the M23, backed by Rwandan forces, launched a military operation to expand its territory, violating a ceasefire agreement between Rwanda and the DRC established through the Luanda Peace Process. On 21 January, the M23 claimed to have captured several cities, including the strategically important supply city of Minova in South Kivu province, located about 20 kilometres from Goma across Lake Kivu.', 'On 24 January, heavy fighting was reported near Sake, more than 20 kilometres north-west of Goma, where the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC), supported by the Southern African Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIRDRC), UN forces (MONUSCO), and a coalition of militia groups, were seeking to halt the M23’s advance toward Goma. The same day, a spokesperson for the M23, as well as Rwandan media, said the military governor of North Kivu, General Peter Cirimwami, was shot while visiting troops on the frontlines near Sake. His death was later confirmed by Congolese officials.', 'According to a statement issued on 25 January by the South African National Defence Force, nine South African soldiers deployed under SAMIRDRC and UN forces were killed in the fighting. Malawi authorities also reported the deaths of three of their soldiers serving in the SAMIRDRC.', 'The UN Security Council met on 26 January to assess the situation in North-Kivu. The next day, M23 rebels said they had taken control of Goma. In its statement, the Security Council condemned M23’s advances in North-Kivu and called on the armed group to stop its offensive as it gave rise to a major humanitarian crisis and called for the protection of civilians.

"Goma, Congo: Understanding the M23 and RDF Attack",https://www.passblue.com/2025/02/02/goma-congo-understanding-the-m23-and-rdf-attack/,"['LEAVE A COMMENT', 'Large parts of Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, are now under the control of the M23 and their Rwanda Defense Force allies. This is likely to be seen, looking back 20 years from now, as a major inflection point in the history of the Congolese conflict. It is the fifth time the city has fallen to a Rwandan-backed rebellion in the past three decades. The first two times, in 1996 and 1998, were during the Great Congo Wars, when Rwanda officially entered its neighbor. At the time, it had the sympathy of many in the international community, as it alleged its only goal was self-defense against the militias who had carried out the genocide in 1994.', 'Since the end of those wars in 2003, Rwanda has never officially intervened but has only been backing proxy groups. In October 2008, the CNDP (National Congress for the Defense of the People), also led by Congolese Tutsi, fought its way to the doorstep of Goma, sending the army fleeing. In November 2012, the M23 — which emerged from the remnants of the CNDP and had much stronger Rwandan backing — took and held Goma for a week.', 'But the times were different. Both of the attacks on Goma spelled the beginning of the end for the Rwandan-backed rebellions as donors pressured Rwanda to pull the plug. In 2008, it took two months before Rwanda decapitated the CNDP, arresting its leader Laurent Nkunda and striking a deal to integrate the rebels into the Congolese army. In 2012, it took around 10 months before the M23 was defeated.', ""Don't miss a  story,  Subscribe to PassBlue"", 'Since then, the world has changed. Western powers seem less willing to use their considerable leverage over Rwanda to force a compromise. While Rwanda used to have the sympathy of Western leaders because of the genocide, now they have been able to cater to the financial and strategic interests of those countries, as well as those of African countries, and have used their considerable diplomatic heft to build relations across the globe.', 'All of this suggests that absent a rapid, radical change in donors’ pressure on Rwanda, the M23 and its Rwandan backers are in Goma to stay and that their occupation could last months and even years. How did we get here?', 'Rwanda: Making Itself Useful', 'In contrast with past rounds of escalation, Rwanda’s intervention has not been met with donor pushback, at least until now.', 'While Rwanda’s dependence on donors has decreased in recent years, foreign grants still contribute 13 percent to their budget; the World Bank estimates that total aid in recent years was the equivalent of 25 to 40 percent of its revenue (much of that does not go through the national budget, hence the discrepancy). Currently, it receives around $1.3 billion in aid; its total budget is just over $4 billion.', 'More importantly, Rwanda depends enormously on its reputation as a stable, peaceful place; it was projected to earn $660 million from tourism in 2024 and has positioned itself as a major conference hub, hosting over 150 conferences in 2023, which earned them $91 million in revenues. Sports business has also boosted earnings: the NBA is partnering with Rwanda in its Basketball Africa League (BAL); the country is hosting a prestigious world cycling event this year; and it has put in a bid for a Formula 1 race.', 'In the past, donors have used this leverage. In 2012, the United States, Germans, Swedes, the UK, the European Union, the Dutch and even the typically apolitical World Bank suspended $240 million in aid. Most of the suspensions happened within months of the creation of the M23, well before they took Goma in November 2012.', 'This time around, however, donors have been reluctant to use this leverage, even though Rwandan support to the M23 is much more significant than in 2012 — six different UN group of expert reports between 2022 and 2024 detail this support: over 4,000 troops, armored vehicles, drones, surface-to-air missile and equipment. And yet, no country has suspended aid this time. In 2022, budgetary aid grants to Rwanda increased 48 percent over the previous year. In 2023, the European Union announced about $939 million of investments in Rwanda through the Global Gateway, which is supposed to be premised on the principles of democratic values, good governance and security, among others.', 'Perhaps most controversially, in the midst of RDF support to the M23, and while the US had suspended military aid to Rwanda due to the M23, the EU made two grants totaling $43 million to the Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) for their operations in Mozambique. Some of that money was supposed to fund the purchase of equipment for RDF troops; it is not clear if there were any attempts to prevent that equipment from being used in the Congo.', 'The other strong backer of Kigali, at least until the Labour government came to power in July 2024, was the UK. It helped organize the Commonwealth Summit in Kigali in June 2022 and refrained from mentioning Rwandan support to the M23. While there have been longstanding ties between both Labour and Conservative parties and the Rwandan government, the UK was particularly dependent on Rwanda through a policy announced in April 2022 to send UK asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing and, if their claims were successful, for permanent relocation.', 'As part of this deal, the UK government paid about $360 million from 2022 to 2024 to Rwanda’s Economic Transformation and Integration Fund (ETIF), which is designed to support economic growth in Rwanda.', 'There was some limited criticism. The US, in particular, clearly denounced Rwandan support to the M23, beginning in mid-2022. Other governments followed suit, and both the US (Gen. Andrew Nyavumba) and the EU (Capt. Jean-Pierre Niragire) have sanctioned individual Rwandan army officers, although the European Union did not express any concern about Gen. Alex Kagame leading RDF operations in Mozambique, despite reports by the UN that he oversaw backing to the M23 in the Congo.', 'This criticism did not have material consequences on Rwanda. The NBA, the International Cycling Union and the Mastercard Foundation all announced major new initiatives in Rwanda during this period, and tourism continued to boom. Celebrities who have visited Rwanda during this period, doing photo-ops with President Paul Kagame include Kevin Hart, Idris Elba, David Luiz, Naomi Campbell, Maria Sharapova, Ellen DeGeneres (who is building a conservation center there), Danai Gurira, Didier Drogba, (then) Prince Charles, Sauti Sol, Patoranking and Youssou Ndour.', 'Why were donors so reluctant to pressure Rwanda?', 'Rwanda has leveraged its army and diplomatic prowess to become useful. The Rwandan Defense Forces are now the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping missions in the world, with 5,879 police and army personnel deployed. This brings in foreign exchange — the UN paid $150 million in 2024 for these deployments, almost the equivalent of the country’s military budget — as well as leverage. It is striking that UN Secretary-General António Guterres, as well as his special representative in the DRC, Bintou Keita, almost never mentioned Rwanda explicitly as backing the M23 (the statement after the fall of Goma, where 17 peacekeepers died, is an exception).', 'Rwanda has also deployed troops in bilateral missions to the Central African Republic (CAR) and to Mozambique, where all together they have around 6,000 troops. In CAR, the US and France have welcomed these troops as a counterweight to Russia’s Wagner Group (now called Africa Corps) troops deployed there. In Mozambique, Rwandan troops have been very efficient in pushing back Islamist militants in Cabo Delgado Province, where TotalEnergies (the largest French company by revenues) has a $20 billion gas project.', 'Despite its small size, Rwanda also punches above its weight diplomatically; the deal its struck with the UK over asylum seekers is an example. Rwandans are currently the head of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the Secretary-General of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, the deputy chairperson of the African Union Commission, the head of the UN peacekeeping mission in CAR, the vice president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, to name just a few.', 'Rwandans are active and well organized at the UN Security Council, as well as at the African Union. For example, for a long time they had been able sway the so-called A3+ — the three African countries in the Security Council (currently, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Somalia, as well as Guyana) — to oppose any explicit mention of Rwanda in Council statements and resolutions. The African Union’s declaration on the fall of Goma makes no mention of Rwanda either, and positions supported by the East African Community also often point in this direction.', 'Finally, the world has changed since 2012. The war in Ukraine, Covid, the conflict in Gaza and the rise of right-wing populism have led to a fraying of multilateralism as many countries look inward or focus on crises they deem more important. For countries like France, which is withdrawing its military deployments in Africa, it is useful to have allies like Rwanda that it can rely on; the US is not very different.', 'Meanwhile, other actors are on the rise in Africa: the United Arab Emirates, Türkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, in addition to China. Diplomacy and pressure seem to be having little impact on other, similar crises: Sudan, Myanmar, Gaza and Ukraine partly because of a lack of will and because peace diplomacy seems to be more difficult in a multipolar, inward-turned world.', 'The DRC: Playing With Fire', 'The Rwandan government has said that the root cause of the M23 problem is the persistence of the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) in the eastern DRC and the discrimination against Congolese Tutsi. As we have argued elsewhere, there is little evidence of an imminent threat from the FDLR to Rwanda in the run-up to the re-emergence of the M23 in November 2021. And while there is a long record of hate speech and violence against the Congolese Tutsi community, there was no uptick in those trends ahead of the M23 rebellion, nor is it clear how a violent rebellion will solve communal tensions; in the past it has just exacerbated them.', 'But the DRC government has made mistakes and missteps in its handling of the crisis. Following the defeat of the M23 in 2013 at the hands of the Congolese army and the UN peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, the M23 fled and was hosted mostly in army camps in Uganda and Rwanda. The DRC signed a statement in December 2013 granting the M23 amnesty for acts of war and insurrection and committing to facilitate the return of the some 80,000 Tutsi refugees from Rwanda –one of the M23’s main demands — where many of them had spent over a decade. They never followed through on this promise.', 'Then, after a small group of M23 fighters installed themselves on the flanks of a volcano in the Virunga National Park in 2016, the government engaged very slowly on talks again with the Rwandan government. In October 2019, the two sides agreed on a roadmap that would lift arrest warrants against M23 leaders, release their members arrested for insurgency and reintegrate those eligible into the FARDC and the National Park Service. Again, this deal was never implemented. An M23 delegation visited Kinshasa, the DRC capital, in 2020, but waited for months without being seen. Finally, in February 2021, the interior minister asked for funds to accompany their demobilization process. Again, it appears that there was no follow-through.', 'Then, when the fighting began, the Congolese army suffered defeat after defeat. For decades, its army has been hampered by a lack of training, equipment and infrastructure. There has also been a history of the government fragmenting and undermining its own security services to better control them and to prevent a coup. Mobutu Sese Seko, DRC’s second president, created overlapping and competing factions that he pitted against each other while allowing the officers to get rich from extortion and embezzlement.', 'After Mobutu’s ouster and the war that ensued (1996-2003), the government of Joseph Kabila (2001-2018) repeated Mobutu’s logic of governance. Kabila was acutely aware of the threat posed to him by the army; his father had been assassinated by his own bodyguard. Moreover, he had to contend with the integration of his former enemies into a new national army during the 2003-2006 peace process. To insulate himself against a coup, it was easier to send the bulk of the troops to the restive east, pitting commanders against each other while allowing them to get rich.', 'DRC’s President Félix Tshisekedi, feeling similarly vulnerable at the head of an officer corps that had been entirely named under his predecessor, continued to value loyalty over competence. While he denounced “the mafia” inside the army, he did little to root out corruption. Reports from the front suggest that some unit commanders inflate their troop numbers, sometimes two- or threefold, to embezzle the additional salaries and funds for food and health care. It is often not clear who is in charge of operations, as different overlapping chains of command compete with each other.', 'These weaknesses led Tshisekedi, despite an army 10 times larger than his battlefield rivals (120,000 FARDC against around 8,000-10,000 RDF/M23) and a military budget that rose to over $1 billion, to seek allies. He obtained the support of Burundian troops, the Southern African Development Community (South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania) and recruited private security contractors, Agemira and Asociatia RALF, to provide training and support.', 'In addition, and perhaps most fatefully, he incorporated local militias, most of which recruit along ethnic lines and have little discipline or training, into the army. In 2022, the parliament passed a law creating a Réserve armée de la défense (RAD), into which many “Wazalendo” — local militias, some of which had been operating for many years — could be merged and receive support. This had some impact, but exacerbated coordination problems and strengthened groups notorious for abusing the local population. The same logic applies to the FDLR, the Rwandan rebellion; much as when it faced other Rwandan-backed rebellions, the Congolese army again began collaborating with the FDLR, allowing Rwanda to argue that this is the real reason for their intervention.', 'What’s Next', 'A few things are clear. The Luanda peace process is most likely dead. Before there can be new talks, there will have to be a ceasefire; as I write this, the M23 and RDF continue their advance down the shore of Lake Kivu toward Bukavu.', 'The fall of Goma will be a milestone in Congolese history. It will be difficult for FARDC and its allies to launch a frontal attack against the M23, now that they occupy the town. They have lost a massive amount of weapons and equipment, along with thousands of troops who have died or have been captured. There will also be a re-evaluation of the senior military leadership, in particular Defense Minister Guy Kabombo Mwadiamvita and the presidential military adviser Franck Ntumba. He had already replaced many of the commanders of the army in a December 2024 shuffle.', 'Tshisekedi’s government will likely try to blame others for the fiasco — the Rwandans, of course, as well as international partners. The outrage could be seen in the streets of Kinshasa on Jan. 28, when foreign embassies were attacked, sometimes violently, by demonstrators, likely encouraged by politicians. But this defeat is likely to cost him politically. He is already bracing for a battle to change the constitution, including potentially to allow him to serve another term after his current mandate ends in 2028. He will need all the popularity he can muster for that challenge; losing part of the country to a Rwandan-backed rebellion could destabilize his coalition.', 'What happens next depends largely on the international community. As I write this, the German and UK governments have suggested that they might re-evaluate their aid to Rwanda due to its involvement in the Congo — no firm suspensions of aid, but a re-evaluation of their position nonetheless. These donors and foreign companies will have to decide whether they can continue to do business and give aid to a country that has created a massive humanitarian crisis in a neighboring country.', 'This essay was adapted from one published in the blog Ebuteli, a Congolese research institute on politics, governance and violence.

Fall of DRC’s Goma: Urgent Action Needed to Avert a Regional War,https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/great-lakes/democratic-republic-congo/fall-drcs-goma-urgent-action-needed-avert-regional-war,"['The fall of eastern Congo’s biggest city has sent thousands from their homes and – once again – left the Great Lakes on the edge of a wider war. African mediators with the concerted backing of external partners should move with speed to prevent more fighting.', 'On the morning of 27 January, Rwandan-backed March 23 (M23) rebels swept into Goma, capital of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s North Kivu province, seizing control of the city of one million. The development marks a dramatic escalation in the long-running crisis. The fighting has uprooted over two million from their homes, exposing thousands around Goma to predation by various militias. Rwanda and the M23 now control practically all of North Kivu province and by force of arms have forged a new reality in the region. Worse could well be on the way. Rebels are pushing deeper into the neighbouring South Kivu province and menacing its capital Bukavu, suggesting they have ambitions beyond Goma or at least are seeking to ramp up the pressure on a weakened Kinshasa. Left unchecked, the fighting could spread throughout the Great Lakes region, recalling the horrors of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when millions died amid a multi-country war in the Congo. ', 'Regional and international diplomacy has failed to meet the moment, even as concerted efforts to halt the fighting have never been more urgent. Right now, the most promising forum are talks convened by Kenyan President William Ruto, the current chair of the East African Community, which begin 29 January. All interested parties – including leaders from the DRC, Rwanda and Angola (which has run its own mediation track at the request of the African Union) should be at the table for this and future rounds. These negotiations will need to focus on short-term measures to stabilise Goma and prevent fresh urban combat which would devastate the city’s traumatised population. Regional diplomats should work with the UN to create humanitarian corridors to supply thousands stranded in and around the city, and seek a caretaker arrangement for Goma, rather than leave Rwanda or the M23 in control while talks continue. Influential external actors, notably the EU and U.S., should throw their weight behind this effort while warning Kigali against advances deeper into its neighbour’s territory.', 'Mostly dormant since their last major incursion into the region in 2012, the M23 suddenly resurged in November 2021 when it attacked Congolese troops. They pushed deep into North Kivu province, repeatedly routing Congo’s ill-equipped and unmotivated soldiers, as well as the motley group of auxiliaries fighting by their side, taking towns and valuable mining sites. The fighting has since pulled in an array of mercenaries, militia and regional powers. The rebels – supported from the beginning by Rwandan arms, troops and logistics – are the latest configuration of Tutsi-dominated insurgents formed in the civil war of the 1990s. ', 'Faced with the growing threat, Kinshasa recruited mercenaries, reportedly from Romania with officers from France, to operate new military hardware, and pulled in troops first from East Africa and then from southern African countries. Neighbouring Burundi, which fielded around 2.000 troops defending Goma, has been one of Kinshasa’s staunchest allies and sent forces in on a bilateral basis in addition to its complement fielded under the southern African deployment. The 12,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO is based in Goma and took part in a few battles against the advancing rebels but avoided major confrontations. In addition, the Congolese military authorities in Goma recruited a collection of militias known as the Wazalendo (or patriots in Swahili). A major feature of the fighting has been the repeated displacement of villagers caught in the crossfire. Women and girls have particularly suffered from predatory acts by armed men on all sides, especially in displacement camps where reports of sexual and gender based violence soared.', 'Rwanda initially denied any role, claiming the crisis was a purely Congolese affair. But evidence has since piled up of their troops’ activities in North Kivu; over 4,000 Rwandan personnel are now in the vicinity, according to the UN and Crisis Group sources. In 2024, Kigali increasingly sought to frame its actions as protection of Congolese Tutsis and defensive measures against threats from the Democratic Liberation Front of Rwanda (FDLR in French), an anti-Kigali group made up of remnants of the forces which committed the 1994 genocide. Kigali also says its actions are a response to the DRC’s hostile military posture and increasingly shrill anti-Kigali rhetoric.', 'Kigali’s narrative justifying its intervention, however, does not square with events on the ground. There, the goal appears less to root out the FDLR than long-term territorial expansion including grabbing mineral-rich regions. The M23 and Rwandan troops have remade areas under their de facto control by embedding their own administrations and pushing out local civilian leaders who oppose them. Absent a diplomatic settlement or the remote possibility of a military pushback, they will be in the Kivus for some time to come. ', 'Fighting ramped up following the collapse of the latest round of talks aimed at tamping down the crisis. In 2022, the African Union invited Angola’s President João Lourenço to mediate the conflict. Luanda energetically took up the mission, convening multiple rounds of engagements, including direct talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and DRC President Félix Tshisekedi. In July 2024 parties agreed to a ceasefire, although that quickly broke down. Talks in December 2024 – which were expected to be the culmination of negotiations – collapsed amid mutual recriminations. The main point of contention was a demand from Kigali that Kinshasa negotiate directly with the M23, a call the DRC flatly rejected, seeing the rebels as a Rwandan stooge.', 'Events on the battlefield then proceeded with head-spinning speed. The M23 – alongside the Rwandan military, perhaps the most disciplined and effective fighting force in the region – resumed its advances in December 2024. It seized territory with a swiftness that left Kinshasa and its allies struggling to respond. On 4 January, the M23 took Masisi, the centre of the province’s lucrative gold and coltan mining industry. Next, they seized Minova, a Lake Kivu port town on the road linking Goma and Bukavu, thus cutting off the army’s ability to receive supplies from Bukavu via Lake Kivu. ', 'Despite all these Congolese military setbacks, the attack on Goma still took many residents by surprise. In the past, the M23 has used rapid advances to secure concessions before pulling back, as it did when the East African regional bloc deployed its troop mission in August 2022. But it soon became clear they were determined to press on this time. The reasons for the timing of the all-out assault remain a mystery but appear linked to their realisation they faced only limited resistance and were pushing against an open door. On 23 January, the M23 shelled Sake, a key town a mere 25 kilometres from Goma that controlled a major supply route into the city. The Congolese provincial military governor General Peter Cirimwami was killed in the fighting near Sake on 24 January, possibly by Rwandan special forces or the M23, though the Rwandans have denied this. ', 'Having gained control of Sake on 23 January, the M23 and Rwandan special forces advanced on Goma the next day, using long-range artillery to successfully sow panic in the ranks of the Congolese army and its auxiliaries. During the weekend of 25 and 26 January, Congolese troops and pro-Kinshasa militia flowed back into the city as fighting engulfed the outskirts. While soldiers from the national army, Southern African regional force and UN tried to hold the lines, including around the airport, they were rapidly overwhelmed and encircled. Over the course of 27 January, M23 columns were increasingly visible, and uncontested, in the centre of the city while international forces kept a low profile or evacuated their bases. On the morning of 28 January, some locals reported pockets of fighting, although some gunshots are likely linked to pillage rather than organised resistance to the M23, with the exception of the airport which was still contested ground. Most worrying are reports that Congolese troops have landed shells on the Rwandan side of the border, reportedly leading to some deaths.  ', 'The weekend’s events have badly exposed the disorganisation of Congolese forces and their allies, which were already suffering from poor or non-existent coordination between the multiple forces present. As they retreated into the city, troops and pro-Kinshasa militia looted civilians. Highly paid mercenaries, there to operate high-tech military drones that had long been effectively grounded by Rwandan air defence, simply disappeared from view. While many will rightly be relieved that the fighting was so limited, Tshisekedi may be wondering how the city fell with such ease. ', 'The risk is real that the situation could escalate into a regional conflagration if talks are not successful. Kigali’s desire to use its superior force to push negotiation positions in its favour is particularly worrying. On the other side, it is unclear how Tshisekedi will respond to the humiliating turn of events. While he is surely tempted to bring in reinforcements, including greater numbers of Burundian troops, there is little prospect they could turn the tide. The disarray at the heart of the government in Kinshasa is a further critical factor. Tshisekedi faces a stark political challenge, with his army having fled the largest city in the east of the country, headquarters of one of the world’s largest UN peacekeeping missions. In short, either side could calculate that more fighting is the best, or the only politically acceptable, option. The consequences for civilians from such a wider war would be forbidding. The last such bout of fighting in the late 1990s left millions dead, primarily due to malnutrition and disease.', 'The war could easily spread beyond the Kivus. Unlike during the last M23 campaign in 2012 and 2013 – when the group was primarily a North Kivu Tutsi force pushing for the integration of its fighters into the Congolese army – this time it has a national agenda. In December 2023, Corneille Nangaa, a former electoral commission chief and close associate of former DRC President Joseph Kabila, announced the formation of the Congo River Alliance (AFC by its French acronym), a coalition of rebels seeking regime change in Kinshasa. While the AFC remains largely a political umbrella for the M23, the rebels have now accumulated resources and allies, making them attractive partners not only to armed groups in eastern DRC but to others aiming to undermine Tshisekedi. This is in line with Kigali’s probable strategy of creating a deniable but powerful Congolese front to exact the maximum leverage over Kinshasa and confirm its dominance of North Kivu, at a minimum', 'On the regional front, the potential for further fighting has never been higher. Clashes pitting the Rwandan army and M23 against Burundian soldiers have already left dozens dead in North Kivu. In addition, Burundi has strong strategic interest in neighbouring South Kivu, including containing the threat posed by Burundian rebels who use the area as a rear base. Any advance by the M23 rebels into the region would pull Gitega in further. The bad blood festers in part for ethnic reasons, as the Burundi government has, at least in the past, collaborated with the FDLR, which has an avowed hatred of Tutsis, while Gitega suspects Kigali of funding mainly Tutsi opponents of the Burundian government. On 25 December 2024, Rwanda’s foreign minister accused Burundi of collaborating with “genocidal forces” in the eastern DRC. Some regional diplomats have told Crisis Group there is a real risk that Kigali expands its ambitions to toppling the Hutu-dominated government in Gitega.', 'All this comes at a particularly delicate time for the DRC. In the course of last year, President Tshisekedi launched a review of the country’s constitution. His political opponents and civil society, including the influential Catholic Church, suspect him of seeking to remove the limits on his own time in office, which would normally block him from serving past 2028, and are mobilising to resist his move. As battle lines harden, his opponents will wield his failures in North Kivu as a political cudgel, while he will likely continue to play the nationalist card and accuse his opponents, as he has before, of being in Rwanda’s pocket.', 'Rwanda’s wider ambitions are hard to read, but assessing their true goals may be crucial for the success of any talks. Behind its rhetoric of self-defence and its participation in African-led mediation, Kigali is determined to secure full influence over North Kivu, capturing its mineral resources and tamping down on any armed resistance. Rwanda is aware that it has by far the most effective army in the region and now wants to create favourable facts on the ground. In recent months, Kigali has moved from a communication strategy of denial to justification, with key political and military figure James Kabarebe in October 2024 asserting the Kivus were historic Rwandan lands “unjustly” taken from Rwandan hands by European colonial powers. Its underlying terms will likely centre around ways it can control the province through proxies, by promoting M23 allies to important posts in the provincial leadership and the army. If Tshisekedi continues to hold out against negotiation on these terms, it seems likely that the M23 may expand the territory it controls, with South Kivu’s capital Bukavu its next major target. ', 'East African leaders are planning a presidential summit for 29 January to try to address the crisis. On 27 January, Kenyan President Ruto announced that both Kagame and Tshisekedi had agreed to attend the talks. As they gather, mediators will have to consider a set of both short- and medium-term priorities. The most immediate issue is to stabilise Goma and prevent any bloodletting in the city. Kinshasa needs to accept that the next steps should be decided around the negotiating table rather than through yet more combat. Given that Kigali’s proxies are now in almost complete control, Kinshasa should refrain from launching a counter-offensive, which would trap thousands of civilians in the crossfire with little prospect of ousting the M23. They should instead give talks a chance to chart a way forward. ', 'The plight of an ever-growing number of desperate displaced people, mainly vulnerable women and children, in camps around Goma should rank high on the agenda. The leaders should press Kigali to commit to creating corridors for the supply of humanitarian assistance. The UN is well placed to lead the effort to reach those in greatest need. It should also keep roads open to supply badly needed food into the markets in the city. ', 'The question of long-term control of North Kivu is a thorny and difficult one. In essence, Kigali wants to have its way in the North Kivu region which abuts its borders – and for Tshisekedi to accept his defeat, which would be a bitter pill to swallow. Nor should regional leaders welcome a result that rewards Rwandan aggression by allowing it to engineer the DRC’s fragmentation, which would create a terrible precedent and clearly violate the African Union’s charter which calls for respect of national borders inherited at independence. But given Rwanda’s formidable military hand, their options are going to be limited. ', 'One possible approach would be for the East African leaders to propose a middle ground, which would see the M23 pulling back from Goma and allowing an alternative African force, possibly mandated from the East African Community, to take administrative control of the city while talks continue. Such a force would need an invitation from Kinshasa but also a green light from Kigali. There is a precedent. In August 2022, a Kenya-led East African force managed to persuade the M23 to pull back hundreds of kilometres from territory it had seized on the proviso that the East Africans, not the Congolese army, would take control of that land. This compromise would still be hard for Kinshasa to stomach but would be preferable to M23 control of Goma and might buy some time for diplomacy to create other options. ', 'While some Western and regional diplomats have some sympathy for Kigali’s interests in North Kivu given its historical and cultural links, they must continue to press Kigali to rethink and abandon its bellicose positioning, which is highly destabilising. They should unite in sending a clear and unequivocal message to Kigali that attempting to expand its war first into Bukavu and potentially elsewhere will draw consequences, including further individual sanctions and travel bans for Rwandan leaders, and a reduction or withdrawal of financial aid to the government and army. The U.S., European Union and Britain – which all have strong diplomatic ties with Kigali and key African states, the latter likely behind closed doors given their aversion to criticise fellow member states – should concertedly send this message across. ', 'For his part, President Ruto, who is leading the East African de-escalation talks, should invite President Lourenço of Angola, whose team has worked tirelessly on the file and who is also the incoming chair of the African Union’s assembly of heads of state, to join this and future rounds to avoid the possibility Kigali will attempt to forum-shop. ', 'Finally, contending with a bracing defeat, Tshisekedi will need to show more flexibility. His consistent stance rejecting all prospect of talks with the M23 now appears untenable given developments on the ground. The escalatory risks of continued conflict in the Kivus and beyond is grave indeed. He would be well advised to soften this position and accept talks going forward. These should be marshalled by whichever configuration of African leaders the parties are comfortable with, and come to an agreement on a roadmap for calming the perennial fighting in a region scarred for too long by repeated bouts of damaging violence.

Throughout the day, a barrage of gunfire and explosions rocked the city, which is the capital of North Kivu province and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts.', 'However, there were conflicting accounts about how much of Goma remained under Congolese control as M23 rebels faced pockets of resistance from army and pro-government militia overnight into Tuesday.', 'Hundreds of thousands of residents and previously displaced people fled to neighbouring towns in panic on Monday.

That means that once you have lost Goma, it’s going to be extremely difficult for the DRC army to recapture the city militarily,” he said.', 'Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya, in a statement posted on X on Monday, announced the presence of the Rwandan army in Goma.', '“The government continues to work to avoid carnage and loss of human life in view of the manifest intentions of Rwanda,” he said, telling residents to stay home and refrain from carrying out vandalism and looting.', 'In a video posted on X, he called for the protection of civilians and said the DRC was “in a war situation where the news is changing”.', 'DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has not yet commented.', 'Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said at the UN Security Council meeting on Sunday that Rwandan troops crossing the border into Goma was a “declaration of war” by Rwanda and the DRC was severing all diplomatic ties.

But the change in the administration in the US potentially may have played a role in changing the calculation there and the thinking that, actually, the diplomatic blowback may not be as severe as once feared,” he told Al Jazeera.', 'At the Security Council meeting, the US called for a ceasefire and urged Rwanda to withdraw support from M23. Acting US Ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea warned that Washington would “consider all the tools at its disposal” to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the conflict.', 'Meanwhile, France has sided with the DRC. “As Goma prepares to fall, France expresses its solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Congo and its territorial integrity. France firmly condemns the offensive,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday.', 'The International Contact Group for the Great Lakes, chaired by Germany, also called for an urgent de-escalation. “The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be respected,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.', 'All eyes are on Ruto as analysts look to see how the EAC will try to negotiate a ceasefire. Previous ceasefires negotiated by Angola were violated by both sides.', 'The African Union’s Peace and Security Council will hold a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. Separately, the Security Council will also meet on Tuesday to discuss developments.', '“[Capturing Goma] puts the M23 in a much stronger position to be able to continue its offensive,” Rouget said. “We’re not necessarily at the end of the group’s progression in eastern Congo. We can see further clashes, further progressions into other cities.”', 'Goma’s capture could also dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and displace thousands more civilians, analysts said. More than a third of the population of North Kivu is displaced, according to the UN.', 'Diplomatic tensions between Rwanda and South Africa are also likely to deepen after the peacekeepers were killed last week, the unnamed analyst in Goma told Al Jazeera, adding: “It won’t be business as usual between Rwanda and SADC.” Additionally, South African public broadcaster SABC reported on Tuesday that four more South African soldiers had been killed.', 'Already, the two governments have less than warm relations: Assassinations of Rwandan dissidents in South Africa in 2014 were traced to Kigali, leading both sides to temporarily sever diplomatic ties.', 'Jason Stearns, a researcher on the DRC, said countries like the US can take action to halt Rwanda’s support of M23. “In the past, donors have used that leverage,” Stearns wrote in the Financial Times this week, referring to 2012 when the US and other Western countries withdrew aid to Rwanda and when M23 was subsequently defeated.', 'But “this time around we seem to be living in a different world, one in which migration, business investments, and national concerns are more important than humanitarianism, and where apathy trumps solidarity,” he wrote.', '', '', '', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business"", 'Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan – the ore from which tantalum is extracted – is mined.', 'Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.', ""Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry."", 'Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.', 'They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.', 'Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a ""state-like administration"", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (£20) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers\' wages to ensure they would carry on working.', 'It runs the area as a monopoly making sure – through the threat of arrest and detention – that only its authorised traders are able to do business.', 'The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.', 'There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.', 'Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.', 'Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.', 'The US\' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – so-called ""conflict minerals"" – are not inadvertently funding violence.', 'But Itsci has come under some criticism.', 'Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.', 'Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.', 'He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.', '""There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don\'t make a good living.

With my best wishes for the New Year, may my blessing come to you all, as I invoke for each one from the Lord peace, serenity and health’. With these words - pronounced immediately after the synthesis in Chinese of his catechesis - Pope Francis this morning, during the general audience held in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican, wished the many peoples of Asia who today celebrate the Lunar New Year.', 'The meeting with the pilgrims was also the occasion for an appeal by the Pontiff on the serious events taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the African country where the M23 militias - supported by the Rwandan army - have occupied the city of Goma and the North-Kivu province, rich in mineral resources, in recent hours. It was precisely from this martyred land - which has counted millions of deaths since 1996 - that two years ago during his apostolic journey the pontiff had denounced the intertwining between this violence and the economic and political interests that feed it, calling on powerful nations and large global corporations to ‘keep their hands off Africa’.', ""‘I urge all parties to the conflict,’ he said today, ’to commit themselves to the cessation of hostilities and to safeguarding the civilian population of Goma and other areas affected by military operations. I also follow with apprehension what is happening in the capital, Kinshasa, hoping that all forms of violence against people and their property will cease as soon as possible. While I pray for the prompt re-establishment of peace and security, I invite the local authorities and the international community to make every effort to resolve the conflict situation by peaceful means'."", 'Today Pope Francis again urged people to pray for peace in Palestine, Israel, Myanmar ‘and so many countries that are at war’.

It is a warning for the constant commitment to peace and to the defence of the dignity of human life in every nation and in every religion’.', 'Earlier in his catechesis, Pope Francis had continued the Jubilee cycle of reflections on Jesus Christ our hope, dwelling on the Gospel passage of the proclamation to Joseph (Mt 1:21) with a text he read only in part. The Pontiff emphasised the thoughtful action of this man whom the evangelist Matthew defines as ‘righteous’: ‘He does not let himself be overcome by instinctive feelings and by fear of taking Mary with him, but prefers to be guided by divine wisdom. In this he is similar to the other Joseph of the Bible, the son of Jacob, nicknamed ‘lord of dreams’.', ""‘What does Joseph of Nazareth dream? - the pope asked himself -. He dreams of the miracle that God performs in Mary's life, and also the miracle that he performs in his own life: to assume a fatherhood capable of guarding, protecting and transmitting a material and spiritual inheritance'. Joseph,' the Pontiff commented, ’asks for no further proof, he trusts God, he accepts God's dream about his life and that of his betrothed. Thus he enters into the grace of those who know how to live the divine promise with faith, hope and love'."", ""‘Let us also ask the Lord,’ he concluded, “for the grace to listen more than we speak, the grace to dream God's dreams and to accept with responsibility the Christ who, from the moment of our baptism, lives and grows in our lives”."", 'Subscribe to Asia News updates or change your preferences']"

The group will seek to consolidate control over Goma, nearby mineral-rich areas, and the surrounding supply lines. The war in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will likely continue to escalate in the short term because M23’s military gains have not forced the DRC to agree to negotiations with M23, and Rwanda is better positioned to deter potential sanctions that caused it to cut its vital support for M23 in 2012. M23 and its Rwandan backers are likely trying to maximize their leverage with the DRC in negotiations and will continue advancing along three axes in the eastern DRC in the absence of an agreement that addresses their maximalist negotiation stance. Some members of M23 and its broader political coalition have signaled that they seek regime change in Kinshasa, which is a threat that would expand the war far across the DRC. The conflict could become a full-blown regional war given Burundi’s current support for the DRC and Uganda’s alleged support for M23. The war is continuing to cause a humanitarian crisis for hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees in the eastern DRC.', 'Rwandan-backed M23 rebels captured Goma, which marks the most significant escalation in the conflict in the eastern DRC since the group last seized the provincial capital in 2012. The group will seek to consolidate control over Goma, nearby mineral-rich areas, and the surrounding supply lines. M23 captured Goma between January 26 and 28 after a series of offensives and counteroffensives against Congolese forces that began in December 2024. M23 launched concerted offensives in the Lubero and Masisi districts in December.[1] Congolese forces eventually halted the rebel group’s offensive in Lubero on December 24, but M23 captured Masisi town in early January 2025.[2] M23 then took several key towns on Lake Kivu on January 21 after a failed Congolese army (FARDC) counteroffensive to secure key supply lines that connect Goma and the Masisi district in mid-January.[3] UN troops and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) initially supported the FARDC against M23 but retreated into a defensive posture after the multilateral forces suffered significant casualties, including the deaths of 17 South African soldiers.[4]', 'Figure 1. M23 Advances in Eastern DRC', ' ', 'Note: The UN reports that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops are fighting alongside M23 in the eastern DRC and “de facto control” M23 operations.', 'Source: Liam Karr; Armed Conflict Location and Event Data.', 'The UN and several countries report that Rwandan forces have been supporting M23 and were directly involved in the fighting in Goma. The UN reported in December 2024 that Rwanda already had 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops in the eastern DRC fighting alongside M23.[5] The United States condemned Rwanda on December 20 for continuing to provide artillery, troop reinforcements, and resupply convoys to the rebel group as it advanced toward Lubero.[6] DRC Foreign Minister Thérèse Wagner and UN officials in northern Goma said on January 26 that Rwandan reinforcements had entered the Goma area from the border with Rwanda in recent days.[7] French media reported the presence of Rwandan special forces in Goma and said that Kigali had deployed an additional 500 to 1,000 troops to support M23 in its offensive.[8]', 'Figure 2. M23 Advances Toward Goma and Masisi', ' ', 'Note: The UN reports that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops are fighting alongside M23 in eastern DRC and “de facto control” M23 operations.', 'Source: Liam Karr; Armed Conflict Location and Event Data.', 'M23 seeks to set up an administration to govern Goma as it has in other areas under its control in the eastern DRC.[9] The UN reported in December 2024 that cadres from M23 and their broader political coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), “systematically held meetings in newly conquered territories to promote its narrative, recruit new members, and consolidate parallel administration.”[10] AFC-M23 signaled they would apply the same strategy when AFC chief Corneille Nangaa held a press conference, declaring “we are not leaving Goma city, and we are here to stay.”[11] Past efforts in AFC-M23-seized zones included sophisticated, “state-like” administrations in key areas, such as mineral-rich areas around Rubaya.[12] The administration in Rubaya involved a mining ministry that awarded permits to, enforced taxes on, and paid salaries to traders and miners in the area.[13] M23 militants also patrolled the town to ensure compliance with the administration’s rules on selling minerals exclusively to M23.[14] M23 and AFC spent 2024 strengthening their capacity to replicate this administrative system. This effort included recruiting and training police, intelligence services, and political leaders.[15]', 'M23’s advances have strengthened the group’s control over critical mineral resources in eastern DRC and supply lines to Rwanda. M23 captured several areas along the North Kivu and South Kivu provincial border that are rich in gold, tantalum (coltan), and tin (cassiterite) ores between January 16 and 21.[16] The area also contains tungsten, which along with tantalum and tin comprise the “3T” minerals that the United States defines as critical minerals for their use in computers, phones, and other electronics.[17] The UN reported in December 2024 that M23 had generated nearly $800 million in taxes on the production, trade, and transport related to the coltan mines around Rubaya since April 2024.[18] Former UN investigator Jason Stearns claimed that Rwandan mineral export revenue has doubled over the last two years and now exceeds $1 billion.[19] This growth includes a jump in gold exports despite Rwanda not being a major gold producer.[20]', 'Figure 3. M23 Activity in Mineral-Rich Areas of the Eastern DRC', ' ', 'Source: Liam Karr; International Peace Information Service.', 'The war in the eastern DRC will likely continue to escalate in the short term because M23’s military gains have not forced the DRC to agree to negotiations with M23, and Rwanda is better positioned to deter potential sanctions that caused it to cut its vital support for M23 in 2012. The DRC has refused repeatedly to negotiate directly with M23 and called direct talks with M23 a “red line.”[21] Congolese officials have called M23 “terrorists” regularly and claimed that Rwanda supports M23 to expropriate the eastern DRC’s mineral resources.[22]', 'The DRC’s stance on M23 and Rwanda’s insistence on direct DRC-M23 negotiations have been an insurmountable obstacle to Kenyan-mediated peace talks between the DRC and armed groups in the eastern DRC and Angolan-mediated peace talks between the DRC and Rwanda.[23] DRC President Félix Tshisekedi accused Kenyan President William Ruto of mismanaging the Nairobi process and “taking up Rwanda’s cause” after Ruto entered office in 2022.[24] Tshisekedi kicked out regional troops that were in eastern DRC to help facilitate the Nairobi process by enforcing a ceasefire, protecting supply routes, and returning displaced civilians because the regional force did not take an aggressive enough approach to insurgents.[25] The Angolan-mediated Luanda Process between the DRC and Rwanda collapsed in December 2024 after Rwanda insisted that the DRC “hold a direct dialogue with the M23” for talks to continue.[26]', 'Tshisekedi has limited options to deviate from this hardline, military-first stance without undermining support among his support base. Prominent political and religious leaders criticized Tshisekedi for cooperating with Rwanda against armed groups early in his first term.[27] Tshisekedi responded in subsequent years by leaning into anti-Rwandan rhetoric, especially during his successful campaign to be re-elected in January 2024. Tshisekedi likened Kagame to Adolf Hitler and promised to declare war on Rwanda.[28] An anonymous European ambassador told La Libre Afrique after the fall of Goma that they “do not see how Tshisekedi and Kagame will be able to sit down at the same table again.”[29]', 'Tshisekedi and regional officials have leaned into anti-Rwandan rhetoric to mobilize the population in support of the Congolese government. Congolese government officials have called for a large-scale “patriotic mobilization” to “fight against the aggressor [Rwanda].”[30] Tshisekedi and other officials have called for increased funding for the FARDC and encouraged civilians to enlist in the FARDC.[31] Congolese government officials and civilians in at least six of DRC’s 26 provinces have encouraged popular demonstrations against Rwanda.[32] Thousands of civilians marched on the streets of Bukavu, the provincial capital of South Kivu, on January 27 to demand that the international community enforce punitive measures on Rwanda.[33] Protestors violently attacked the embassies of Belgium, France, Japan, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and the United States in Kinshasa on January 28 to “denounce the passivity of the international community.”[34]', 'Rwanda has strengthened its partnerships with the West over the last decade, and these partnerships have partially deterred sanctions on Rwanda, unlike the last time that M23 seized Goma in 2012. Rwanda cut its support for M23 and let the group collapse under pressure from UN and FARDC forces in 2012 and 2013 after the international community suspended $240 million in aid to Rwanda as part of widespread sanctions.[35] At least a third of Rwanda’s budget comes from foreign aid, and World Bank figures from 2021 show that the $1.25 billion that Rwanda received in official development assistance was equal to 74 percent of central government spending that year.[36]', 'Rwanda has boosted its image since 2012 by positioning itself as a critical stabilizing force in other African conflicts that affect Western interests more directly than the DRC conflict. Rwanda is the second-largest police and troop contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and the largest in Africa, with over 5,000 personnel deployed as part of UN missions in South Sudan and the Central African Republic.[37] Rwanda has also deployed thousands of troops bilaterally to quell conflicts in the Central African Republic and Mozambique and has discussed a third bilateral deployment to contain the Salafi-jihadi insurgency in Benin.[38] These bilateral deployments align heavily with Western interests, especially amid growing aversion from some African governments toward UN and Western military interventions. Rwanda serves as an alternative to Russian mercenaries that are active in the Central African Republic, while Rwandan forces have contained Islamic State–affiliated insurgents in Mozambique that threaten French and US gas projects. These aligned interests have led the West to strongly support and fund the Rwandan deployments as a way to support “African solutions to African problems.”[39]', 'Rwanda has also focused on growing its economy to position itself as a hub for foreign investment for Western countries and businesses, including Western efforts to secure strategically important critical mineral supply chains. The EU signed a memorandum of understanding with Rwanda in February 2024 to strengthen the EU-Rwanda critical mineral supply chains.[40] The EU has also invested more than €900 million in Rwanda as part of the EU Global Gateway program.[41] Rwanda has courted major sports entities to boost its image, similar to the “sportswashing” that many Gulf countries and Russia are accused of. The NBA has a partnership with Rwanda to host the Basketball Africa League, Formula 1 is choosing between Rwanda and South Africa as two of the leading options for a race in Africa, and Rwanda’s tourism agency sponsors major European soccer teams in England, France, and Germany.[42]', 'The United Kingdom and a handful of countries have discussed imposing sanctions on Rwanda, but there has not been coordinated action against Rwanda like in 2012. The UK ambassador to the UN said that M23 attacks on UN forces “can be considered war crimes punishable by sanctions,” and the UK foreign secretary warned Kagame that Rwandan actions had put Rwanda’s global aid under threat during a phone call on January 26.[43] Both the EU and the United States said that they would examine all means necessary to punish Rwanda for M23’s attack on Goma but did not explicitly mention using sanctions.[44] Belgian politicians had previously been strongly critical of Rwanda’s activity in eastern DRC and urged the EU to sanction Rwanda after the seizure of Goma.[45] Germany canceled foreign aid–related talks with Rwanda and demanded that M23 and Rwanda withdraw their troops from the eastern DRC.[46]', 'The DRC and M23 are unlikely to agree to a multilateral force occupying contested territory in eastern DRC. M23 agreed to cede captured territory to regional forces from the East African Community in January 2023 as part of the Nairobi process.[47] Tshisekedi kicked these regional forces out for not taking stronger action against M23, however, and opted to rely on SADC forces, foreign mercenaries, and 40,000 local militia fighters known as Wazalendos.[48] This move ended the fragile ceasefire that had been in place and led M23 to recapture most of these areas. M23 has clashed with multilateral forces since 2012 on numerous occasions and has warned the UN and SADC against interfering in the ongoing conflict multiple times in January.[49] The group’s moves to administer Goma and other captured territories further signal that its long-term intent to unilaterally control these areas, not turn them over to multilateral forces.', 'M23 and its Rwandan backers are likely trying to maximize their leverage with the DRC in negotiations and will continue advancing along three axes in eastern DRC in the absence of peace talks that address their maximalist demands. M23 and its Rwandan backers likely aim to secure an agreement that legitimizes M23’s control of parts of eastern DRC. Rwanda has continued to insist that the DRC negotiate with M23, which demands that the Congolese government implement the 2013 Nairobi peace deal. The deal stipulated that M23 would demilitarize and become a political party and that the Congolese government would facilitate the return of refugees, release prisoners, reintegrate former rebels, and launch a national reconciliation and justice initiative as well as social security and economic reforms.[50] M23’s efforts to set up an administrative system within the eastern DRC indicate that it intends to continue to govern these areas, possibly after a peace agreement in which AFC-M23 became a legitimate political party. This arrangement would also benefit Rwanda, which “de facto controls” M23 according to the UN and seeks an economic and security buffer zone in the eastern DRC.', 'Rwanda and M23 will likely be open to ceasefires as they seek to consolidate their recent gains, but they will retain their maximalist demands. Kagame said on January 28 that he “agreed” on the need for a ceasefire in the eastern DRC after a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.[51] The New York Times reported that M23 is “demanding direct peace negotiations” with Kinshasa after seizing Goma.[52] Pro-government militia fighters in eastern DRC accused M23 of taking advantage of previous ceasefires to reset its forces without fear of counterattacks, however.[53] Armed Conflict Location and Event Data loosely supports this trend and shows a general uptick in M23-related clashes two to four months after previous ceasefires have taken effect.[54]', 'M23 has continued to push southward toward the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu after capturing critical locations on the RN2 highway and Lake Kivu in the early stages of its offensive on Goma.[55] Kinshasa-based Actualite.cd reported that the rebels advanced in Kalehe district on January 29 and took control of Kiniezire and Mukwidja towns, which are roughly 62 miles (80 kilometers) north of Kavumu.[56] Kavumu is a major operational objective for M23 due to the Burundian-FARDC military base in the town and the nearby airport that lies 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Bukavu.[57] Local reports warned of the presence of hostile drones over the Kavumu airport on January 29.[58] The South Kivu governor outlawed civilian boat traffic on Lake Kivu and enacted heightened security measures in Bukavu on January 29 in anticipation of M23’s advance.[59] Independent French journalist Christophe Riguad reported that M23 had repositioned troops from nearly a dozen towns that it controls in Rutshuru territory for the offensive on this axis after the group seized Goma.[60]', 'Figure 4.

Masisi is the gateway to Walikale town, which is the westernmost district capital in the North Kivu region and serves as the gateway to the interior of the DRC along the RN3 highway. M23’s advances expand its access to gold, tantalum, and tin ores.[61] M23 has also maintained pressure around Pinga since October 2024, a garrison town in Walikale district 30 miles north of Masisi that lies on an alternative route toward Walikale.[62]', 'Figure 5.

M23 made several operationally significant breakthroughs in the Lubero district in mid-December.[63] Congolese forces eventually halted the M23 advance in the Lubero district near Mambasa on December 24, less than 15 miles south of Lubero town, but have failed to regain any operationally significant areas so far.[64] Lubero is 20 miles (33 kilometers) south of Butembo, which is a major trade hub and hosts an airport and FARDC base. The Islamic State Central Africa Province, locally known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ISCAP-ADF), is a major obstacle to further M23 expansion north of Lubero town, but the UN reported in December that M23 has liaised with ISCAP-ADF and sought to secure a non-aggression pact that would grant M23 access to areas where the ISCAP-ADF operates.[65]', 'Figure 6. M23 Advances Northwards Toward Lubero', ' ', 'Note: The UN reports that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops are fighting alongside M23 in the eastern DRC and “de facto control” M23 operations.', 'Source: Liam Karr; Armed Conflict Location and Event Data.', 'Leaders of the M23 and the broader AFC alliance have signaled that they seek regime change in Kinshasa, which is a threat that risks expanding the conflict far across the DRC. Multiple senior leaders, including AFC head Corneille Nangaa, have told international outlets that “2025 is not 2012” and that the group plans to continue fighting all the way to Kinshasa.[66] The UN published the transcript of an M23 commander urging troops to march to Kinshasha during a rally in May 2024.[67] M23-AFC has also forged alliances with some armed groups in Ituri Province in northeastern DRC and is attempting to recruit and build a wider coalition that creates a united front with the major armed groups that operate in the area.[68] M23 did not have the capacity to achieve these aims or build such alliances when it last seized Goma in 2012, and FARDC forces have shown to be ineffective in the face of better-motivated and better-equipped M23 and Rwandan forces.[69] M23 would require Rwandan support to achieve this objective, however, and it remains unclear if Rwanda seeks regime change. The UN reported that Rwandan support has given M23 a significant personnel and hardware advantage, which has contributed to the group’s rapid advances.[70]', 'The conflict could become a full-blown regional war given Burundi’s current support for the DRC and Uganda’s alleged support for M23. Burundi has deployed several thousand soldiers to fight alongside FARDC forces to both counter Rwanda and contain Burundian rebels that operate in eastern DRC.[71] The UN reported in 2023 that Burundian forces had suffered significant casualties and that Rwandan forces prioritize targeting Burundian forces during battles. Burundian military officials refuted M23’s claim that the group killed over 200 Burundian soldiers in clashes in mid-January 2025.[72]', 'Burundi and Rwanda view their competition in the DRC as potentially existential. Burundi has collaborated with the FDLR, a militia group in the DRC linked with the Rwandan genocide that the Rwandan government has labeled as a national security threat.[73] The Hutu-dominated Burundian government suspects that Rwanda funds Tutsi opposition groups in Burundi, and regional diplomats told the International Crisis Group that Rwanda may intend to topple the Burundian government.[74]', 'Uganda already supports M23 according to the UN and could become more involved in the conflict. Uganda’s role is complex given its ongoing joint operations with the FARDC against ISCAP-ADF in the eastern DRC and its historically turbulent relationship with Rwanda.[75] Uganda and Rwanda have oscillated between collaboration and competition in the DRC.[76] Both countries were initially on the same side in the First and Second Congo Wars but then began to diverge and support separate rebel groups as they sought to carve out their own sphere of influence.[77] Uganda has avoided taking a strong position in the current M23 conflict but thawed its relations with Rwanda since 2022 and grown its ties with M23.[78]', 'The war is continuing to cause a humanitarian crisis for hundreds of thousands of Congolese refugees in the eastern DRC. The UN reported before M23’s seizure of Goma that the group’s recent advances have displaced over 237,000 total since the start of 2025.[79] Some of these refugees had no choice but to flee to Goma, where more than 400,000 internally displaced persons were already living in camps on the city’s outskirts.[80] The fighting in Goma has severely limited humanitarian activities and basic services in the area, displaced an additional 300,000 people, and overwhelmed health facilities with injured civilians.[81] The closure of Goma airport and surrounding roadways has also prevented humanitarian cargo and personnel from reaching Goma.[82]', '[1] https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/africa-file-december-19-2024-russia-reinforces-libya-amid-syria-withdrawal-drc-rwanda-talks-collapse-ethiopias-counter-fano-campaign-issp-strangles-roadways-in-niger-ankara-declaration#DRC;

5 things to know about the fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo,https://www.npr.org/2025/01/31/nx-s1-5281422/congo-goma-fighting-m23-rwanda-drc,"['By ', 'Emmet Livingstone', 'M23 rebels patrol the streets of Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Wednesday.', 'GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — On Monday, M23 rebels backed by Rwandan troops entered the city of Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. They have now taken control of the city, and on Thursday, in their first press conference, declared that they were ""here to stay.""', 'They raised the prospect of further expansion of territory under their control. DRC\'s government has called the takeover a ""declaration of war"" by neighboring Rwanda.', ""Goma, a regional hub of over 2 million people, is on the DRC's border with Rwanda. The city has been afflicted by the ebb and flow of violence for three decades — collateral damage in conflicts that exploded in eastern Congo after the 1994 Rwandan genocide."", 'The capture of Goma is a dramatic culmination of over three years of conflict in North Kivu province. The M23 is now threatening to march ""all the way to Kinshasa,"" the DRC capital, in a conflict that could have seismic impacts across central Africa. Here is what to know.', '', 'The M23 is one of dozens of armed groups active in eastern DRC, where militias have sown chaos for over three decades.', 'The conflict is a legacy of multistate wars that played out in Congo after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which as many as 1 million people, mainly of the Tutsi ethnic group, were killed by Hutu extremists. Tutsi rebels led by current Rwandan President Paul Kagame put an end to the killing, and many Hutu perpetrators fled across the border into Congo.', 'The M23, or March 23 movement, refers to the date of an earlier peace agreement the group claims the Congolese government failed to honor. The rebel group, led by Congolese Tutsi commanders, formed in 2012 and is a successor to earlier Tutsi-led rebellions. It briefly captured Goma the same year before being driven out.', 'Desperately poor, but rich in minerals used in electronics and mobile phones, eastern Congo is ethnically diverse. Many militias have origins in specific local communities.', ""People rush to shop in downtown Goma, Congo, on Thursday, after the M23 rebels advanced into eastern Congo's capital Goma."", 'After years of lying dormant, the M23 relaunched its rebellion in North Kivu in late 2021, capturing territory including a key border crossing into Uganda. By January 2022, it had mostly surrounded Goma, leaving a pocket of government-controlled territory around the city.', 'The conflict ebbed and flowed, with the rebels pushing farther north. This month, it expanded into the neighboring province of South Kivu. It completed the encirclement of Goma and began to push inside the city.', 'M23 leaders say that they are fighting to protect ethnic minorities against a DRC government they accuse of fomenting hate speech and discrimination.

During those two wars, nine African nations and some 20 armed groups fought each other, with the Second Congo War in particular considered to be one of the deadliest conflicts in history.', 'The M23 and Rwandan troops are moving farther into the province of South Kivu, according to local reports on the ground.

Of course.', 'First of all, I want to refer us to the report of the United Nations group of experts. This is not a report that was drafted by the Congolese government. This is a group of experts that have been appointed by the United Nations Security Council.', 'In December, they spoke of about 4,000 Rwandan defense troops present in the DRC.

You said just this week to that council that Congo has been raising the alarm about this M23 group for the past three years.', ""What do you think that the U.N. or the international community could have done that they didn't do that would have prevented this situation from escalating the way it is today, and what can they do now?"", 'Therese Kayikwamba Wagner:', ""So it is important to highlight that this situation we're facing right now, the imminent M23 crisis, is part of a larger history."", 'It is part of three decades of President Kagame being unpunished and uncontrolled by the international community. This is not the first iteration of the M23. I myself worked as a humanitarian in 2012 when the M23 took over Goma, again co-piloted by the Rwandan Defense Forces.', 'Now, looking at what could have been done, the first point was calling out Rwanda. It took a very long time. And we welcome the fact that it was the United States of America that were the first country in the United Nations Security Council to explicitly name Rwanda as the stakeholder or as the country occupying parts of the DRC.', 'And it took a while, but, gradually, we saw that other members of the council took on. So action could have been taken earlier, but action can also be taken now. First of all is demanding the full withdrawal of Rwandan defense troops from the DRC, second of all, imposing an embargo on all minerals that Rwanda is exporting to the global market under the label of Rwanda, well knowing that they are mined illegally in the DRC.', 'Third of all, Rwanda no longer deserves to contribute troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions.

Nuncio in Kinshasa: Pope’s message in DRC ‘more relevant than ever',https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-01/nuncio-drc-interview-pope-visit-anniversary-appeal-violence-goma.html,"['By Delphine Allaire ', ""Protecting the civilian population of Goma and praying for a swift restoration of peace and security in the DRC—two years after his apostolic journey to the largest Catholic and French-speaking country in Africa, Pope Francis' appeal during his general audience on Wednesday, 29 January, carries particular significance. His words reflect sorrow and frustration over the ongoing war, often overlooked by the international community and appeal for greater global mobilization in resolving the conflict."", 'According to the Pope’s representative in the DRC, several Congolese bishops and the country’s Prime Minister have expressed gratitude for his public intervention.', 'The Apostolic Nunciature in Kinshasa was the site of a memorable encounter two years ago, on February 1, 2023, where the Holy Father listened to the harrowing testimonies of four victims of wartime atrocities in the east—violence that prevented the Pope from visiting Goma during his apostolic visit. Today, these brutal accounts, reflections of inhuman violence, seem to have been forgotten, laments, Archbishop Mitja Leskovar, the Apostolic Nuncio in Kinshasa.', 'Q: What information do you have about the worsening security situation in the East of the country?', 'The situation in the east is very serious and delicate. There are casualties, with reports of bodies lying in the streets. Gunfire continues in multiple areas. However, not all parts of Goma are affected, allowing some residents to meet basic needs such as food. The city is effectively under siege, which could escalate into a broader conflict. Beyond Goma, fighting continues across the region, with devastating consequences for local communities. We hope for a return to negotiations, diplomatic solutions, dialogue among all parties, and an end to violence.', ""Q: How were the Pope's words received by the authorities and the people?"", 'With gratitude. The Prime Minister and several bishops thanked me for his remarks. His call for respect for all people—civilians, public order, and property—came at a particularly difficult moment, not only for the eastern provinces but also for the capital, where unrest has occurred. The message was timely and well received.', 'Q: How can the Holy See support the urgent humanitarian needs in eastern Congo?', ' ', 'At the moment, it is very difficult, primarily due to logistical challenges in delivering aid to a war zone. Even without conflict, transport is complicated by poor roads, sometimes impassable for vehicles, leaving only motorcycles or foot travel as options.', 'Additionally, it is hard to determine the most urgent needs and where they are most critical. The third and perhaps most significant challenge is the sheer scale of the crisis—six to seven million displaced people in the DRC require assistance. The UN, other organizations, and numerous NGOs, including the Catholic Church, are providing aid, but the needs are overwhelming. Despite these difficulties, we continue to support relief efforts through Church institutions such as Caritas, dioceses, and religious congregations, ensuring aid reaches those in need.', 'Q: What role can the Catholic Church in the DRC play in fostering peace?', ""The Church's immediate priority is addressing basic human needs to the extent possible. Many hospitals near conflict zones are overwhelmed with wounded people, lacking space and resources. The Church-run medical facilities, often the only available healthcare providers, play a crucial role."", ""Beyond humanitarian aid, the Church is committed to peacebuilding. Here, as elsewhere, peace is not just about weapons but about fostering dialogue and understanding among all parties to reach compromises. A willingness to compromise is essential—without it, peace remains unattainable. The Church is actively promoting broad social dialogue in the hope of achieving a political solution. While political decisions are not within the Church's direct responsibility, the Church supports the initial steps toward social dialogue."", 'Q: How can the Holy See encourage greater international involvement in resolving the crisis?', 'The Holy See is already working in this direction. The Pope continually draws international attention to the country’s struggles, which are often forgotten. The Vatican also engages in bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. The Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in New York is involved in these efforts, and the Vatican consistently emphasizes the importance of a peaceful and negotiated resolution in its diplomatic contacts with states.', 'Q: Two years ago, the Pope met with victims of violence in the east during his apostolic visit. Since then, the situation has deteriorated. Have his words been forgotten?', ""I arrived in the DRC in June 2024, so I was not present for the Pope's visit. However, I have followed the testimonies of war and ethnic violence victims. These accounts deeply affect me for two reasons: first, the sheer brutality and hatred behind the violence, which at times reaches levels of inhuman cruelty. Second, the remarkable capacity of victims to forgive. For instance, some brought a machete similar to the one used to kill their father. Too many people have forgotten these testimonies. Revisiting them would be beneficial—they remain publicly available."", 'Just this morning, one of my colleagues informed me about reactions to the President’s speech on the current crisis. One person commented: ""These are just nice words—we want war."" Such statements reveal a lack of awareness of past suffering. It is tragic that many people, including ordinary citizens, have forgotten these testimonies.', 'Q: Two years ago, the Pope called on the Congolese people to take reconciliation and change into their own hands. What lasting impact has his visit had?', 'The Pope’s message from two years ago is more relevant than ever. Violence only worsens suffering, displacing more people, destabilizing society, and deepening poverty. This cycle of violence must end. Dialogue and willingness to compromise are the only paths to peace in this war-torn country.', 'Q: How can the DRC break free from the cycles of power struggles and exploitation that the Pope denounced two years ago?', 'Complex problems require complex solutions. Action is needed at multiple levels: internationally, by strengthening state institutions, combating corruption, and fostering civic responsibility. One of the greatest challenges is the lack of concern for the common good, with too much focus on individual interests. Raising awareness about shared responsibility for national development is crucial.', 'The Pope has emphasized that genuine change requires a ""conversion of hearts."" Solutions cannot come solely from state institutions or the international community; individuals must also transform their attitudes, habits, and convictions. These three approaches—international engagement, institutional strengthening, and personal transformation—are key to resolving the crisis.', 'Q: In this Jubilee Year of Hope, where can the DRC find hope, given its challenges?', 'Hope exists because human beings are always capable of change and committing to peace. There is no such thing as a lost cause. While progress requires effort and sacrifice, improvement is possible. We cannot create paradise on earth—history has proven that such attempts fail. But that does not mean we should do nothing.', 'Consider education: the Catholic Church manages 40–50% of the country’s schools, demonstrating a significant and ongoing contribution to society. Initiatives for peace and dialogue exist, and they must be strengthened and expanded. Above all, prayer remains essential. I urge everyone listening to pray for peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.', 'Thank you for reading our article. You can keep up-to-date by subscribing to our daily newsletter.

The Fall of Goma,https://www.cfr.org/blog/fall-goma,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'As civilians in Goma once again flee chaos, leaders fail to take responsibility for the crisis. ', 'Post by Michelle Gavin', 'January 28, 2025 11:46 am (EST)', 'Once again, the eastern Congolese city of Goma has fallen to the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group. The mayhem is certainly real; the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) displacement crisis is second only to Sudan’s, and many of the roughly 1.5 million people now trapped in Goma have been on the run from conflict for years. Peacekeepers from the United Nations and the Southern African Development Community were killed in the latest advance. But drivers of the conflict are murkier than the scale of the emergency, particularly if one tries to glean insight from the rhetoric of the antagonists involved.  ', 'The President of the DRC, Felix Tshisekedi, insists that the conflict is fundamentally about Rwanda’s violations of Congolese sovereignty. As far as the M23 goes, he is right. But the insecurity in eastern Congo is a bigger problem—scores of armed groups terrorize the region’s civilians, and while Tshisekedi has leveraged the crisis to whip up nationalist sentiment to his political advantage in the past, he shows little interest in the hard, incremental work of tackling the country’s problems through governance. The corruption that has eroded the efficacy of the state and its security services persists, while Tshisekedi seems intent on extending his tenure of dubious legitimacy.  ', 'More on:', 'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'Wars and Conflict', 'Humanitarian Crises', 'Rwanda', 'Violent Nonstate Actors', 'Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, generally declines to formally acknowledge his government’s direct role in the conflict—which includes sending its own armed forces to fight as well as providing support to the M23, but regularly reminds the world of the horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. He insists that Rwanda must act to protect ethnic Tutsis living in the DRC from persecution, and accuses Congolese security services of colluding with the FDLR, an organization comprised of perpetrators of that genocide and their adherents which now operates in eastern Congo among the region’s many armed groups. But as Jason Stearns wrote in the Financial Times, “It was the emergence of the M23 that led to a rise in hate speech against Tutsi and collaboration between the Congolese army and the FDLR.” If protecting ethnic Tutsis was the point, Rwanda’s approach has been obviously self-defeating for years. It’s also impossible to ignore the economic incentives for Rwanda’s actions, as the M23 seizes lucrative mines and ships the minerals extracted there across the border to Rwanda. What could be more cynical than a cash grab wrapped up in “never again?” ', 'Michelle Gavin, Ebenezer Obadare, and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa. Most weekdays.', '', 'It’s not unreasonable to ask if this time, the ultimate aim is something bigger. After all, Rwanda backed the movement that led to the fall of Mobutu and the beginning of the Kabila dynasty.  The leader of the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of groups opposed to the Congolese government, has said that “Our objective is neither Goma nor Bukavu but Kinshasa, the source of all the problems.” Ironically, this very man, Cornielle Nangaa, headed the electoral commission in 2018 that brought Tshisekedi to power in a backroom deal with Joseph Kabila, disregarding the actual outcome of the vote. If Nangaa remains closely connected to Kabila, it’s hard to square with his talk about fundamental change. After all, Kabila presided over nearly two decades of dysfunction and instability in the east.  ', 'In any case, U.S. standing in the region has taken yet another hit, as Congolese furious with what they perceive as Western backing for Rwanda have attacked the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Kinshasa. U.S. adversaries, eager for access to Congolese minerals, will be quick to take advantage of the popular mood. ', 'The terrible pain borne by the people of eastern Congo is collateral damage in a never-ending set of cynical maneuvers by leaders pursuing power and riches. In a moment when international norms are disappearing by the day, institutions aimed at protecting peace and security are failing, and global leadership—the kind that pressured Rwanda to back down the last time Goma was taken—is missing in action, Congo provides a hellish preview of what “anything goes” looks like.
