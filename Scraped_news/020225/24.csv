The historic significance of Trump's tariff actions,https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/historic-significance-trumps-tariff-actions,"['', '', '', '', 'On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico (except energy products from Canada, which will be taxed at 10 percent), along with a 10 percent tariff on imports from China. On February 3, 2025, the Trump administration decided to postpone for 30 days the implementation of the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but the threat to impose them remains. Although these plans could change at any time, the imposition of these tariffs would constitute a historic event in the annals of US trade policy and would amount to one of the largest increases in trade taxes in US history.', ""One has to go back almost a century to find tariff increases comparable to what the president is planning. Before the United States pivoted in the 1930s toward trade agreements to reduce tariffs, Congress regularly voted to change the import duties in the tariff code. Perhaps the most infamous was the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, enacted as the world economy was sinking into the Great Depression. There was also the McKinley tariff of 1890, one that Trump has often touted as being responsible for America's economic success in the late 19th century, although it too was followed by a severe depression of 1893–96. And there is the Fordney-McCumber tariff of 1922, designed to reverse a Democratic tariff reduction in 1913. All of these tariff rate increases were enacted by Republican congresses and signed by Republican presidents. Now, of course, presidents have discretion in setting tariff rates, and that is what Trump has done."", 'How do the new Trump tariffs, as announced on February 1, compare to these past tariff increases? Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way of comparing tariffs over time. These actions differ in the base from which they start, the degree to which they increase rates, the share of trade they cover, and the importance of trade in the economy, among many other dimensions. For example, which is more significant: a tariff that raises duties from 5 percent to 10 percent on 100 percent of imports, or a tariff that raises duties from 20 percent to 40 percent on 40 percent of all imports?', 'Still, it is possible to make some very basic comparisons, at a broad level, to see which tariff changes might be more significant.', ""Let's start with the proposed new tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. In 2023, these imports accounted for 29 percent of total US imports of goods, amounting to 3.2 percent of US GDP (source: Exhibit 13, FT-900 2023 Annual). These imports entered the United States duty free, just as US exports to Canada and Mexico were given duty-free treatment under the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA), the Trump-negotiated successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Trump administration would raise tariffs from 0 percent to 25 percent on imports that amount to more than 3 percent of GDP, with the exception of imports of oil from Canada, for which the tariff will be 10 percent. (Oil accounts for about $93 billion of the $419 billion worth of imports from Canada, or 0.3 percent of GDP.)"", 'In addition, a new tariff of 10 percent will be levied on imports from China. In 2023, those imports comprised 14 percent of total US imports, or 1.5 percent of GDP.', 'If implemented, what will these new tariffs do to the average tariff level of the United States? In 2023, the last year with full annual data available, the average US tariff on all imports was 2.4 percent, and the average US tariff on dutiable imports was 7.4 percent, according to the US International Trade Commission. Now all imports from Canada and Mexico move off the duty-free list and become dutiable, and imports from China face an additional tariff. Assuming no change in the amount of imports, which would give us an upper bound of the impact of the new tariffs on the average tariff, the Trump tariff hike would increase the average tariff on total imports from 2.4 percent to 10.5 percent, an increase of 8.1 percentage points. It would also increase the average tariff on dutiable imports from 7.4 percent to 17.3 percent, an increase of 9.9 percentage points.', 'This static calculation is an upper bound because it does not incorporate any reduction in imports because of the tariffs. The reduction of imports subject to the tariffs would dampen the measured increase in average tariffs as importers substitute away from those goods. However, what makes the static approach useful is that, in the past, the Tariff Commission and congressional committees used exactly that method when they were evaluating the change in the average tariff due to new legislation. Hence, the crude approach here is roughly comparable to that used to examine past tariff legislation.', ""The table below reports on the share of imports affected by the four major tariff changes over the past century (as a percentage of GDP), the baseline tariff in place before the tariff change, the increase in the average tariff (static estimate), and the percentage point change in the average tariff. Because trade is a larger part of the economy today than in the past, Trump's current tariffs directly impact a larger fraction of the US economy. Notably, the Smoot-Hawley tariff hit dutiable imports when they amounted to just 1.4 percent of GDP (1929). Trump's new tariffs increase the average tariff on dutiable imports by 9.9 percentage points, significantly more than Smoot-Hawley but starting from a much lower base. Even after the Trump tariffs, however, the average tariff on dutiable and total imports still will be considerably lower than during the previous tariff regime."", 'The McKinley and Fordney-McCumber tariffs were substantial additions to the already high existing tariffs. But their economic impact was much smaller because imports were a relatively small share of GDP. One of the biggest differences between a century ago and today is the growth of global supply chains and international production networks. These factors make trade, and particularly trade in intermediate goods and components, a much more significant part of the US economy today than in the distant past and tariffs a much greater disruption to the economy.', 'The figure below shows another way to put the proposed Trump tariffs in historical perspective. This figure presents the average US tariff from 1790 to 2023 and includes the prospective tariff changes with the new duties on Canada, Mexico, and China. The average tariff rises much more sharply than during the first Trump administration, when tariffs were imposed on about half of imports from China and on imported steel and aluminum. The most recent tariff increase is easily the largest since World War II and marks a clear break from the more or less continuous reduction in tariffs since 1932. The new Trump tariffs are likely to put the average tariff back to where it had been in the 1940s. The United States has not seen an average tariff on total imports of around 10 percent since 1943 and has not seen an average tariff on dutiable imports of about 17 percent since 1947.', '', 'Even with the new Trump tariffs, the average tariff would remain much lower than in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We are not close to the days of the Tariff of Abomination (1828) or Smoot-Hawley (1930). But then again, the president has promised that more tariffs are to come. New tariffs on imports from the European Union, which amounted to 2.1 percent of US GDP in 2023, would change these calculations considerably.', 'The data underlying this analysis can be downloaded here [xlsx].', 'Senior Research Staff', 'OP-EDS', 'November 29, 2024', 'via LinkedIn', 'OP-EDS', 'November 10, 2024', 'via East Asia Forum', 'POLICY BRIEFS', 'October 2024', 'Subscribe to the PIIE Insider Weekly Newsletter', 'PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS', 'The Peterson Institute for International Economics is an independent nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization dedicated to strengthening prosperity and human welfare in the global economy through expert analysis and practical policy solutions.', 'LEARN MORE ABOUT PIIE', 'ADDRESS', '1750 Massachusetts Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20036']"

[+]', 'Trump has long proposed raising tariffs—or taxes on imported goods that the businesses importing them pay the U.S. government—before the election, and said in November he’ll impose a 25% tariff rate on all imports from Mexico and Canada on the first day of his presidency and will impose an additional 10% tariff rate on all imports from China on top of other tariffs.', 'Trump told reporters after his inauguration he planned to levy 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting February 1 and followed through on those plans Saturday, but levied a lower 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports to “minimize any disruptive effect” on gas prices in the U.S., trade advisor Peter Navarro told reporters.', 'It comes after Trump signed executive order at the start of his second term, directing federal agencies like the Treasury Department and Department of Commerce to start investigating ways to implement an “America First trade policy,” including through tariffs, and deliver a report by April 1, and has publicly said in recent days he’s still considering broader tariffs across the board on all foreign imports.', 'Trump’s previously proposed raising tariffs by 10%, or by 60% on goods imported from China—which is up from approximately 1% and 11% during the Biden administration, respectively, according to data from research firm Wolfe Research cited by the Wall Street Journal.', 'While the cost of tariffs can be absorbed by some combination of U.S. businesses that import goods, the customers who purchase them and foreign businesses that export them—which might lower their prices to make up for the tariffs—the right-leaning Tax Foundation found previous tariffs levied during Trump’s first term were paid by U.S. businesses and consumers.', 'Goldman Sachs economists led by Ronnie Walker projected in April that prices on consumer goods would go up by 0.1% for every percentage increase in the effective tariff rate and raise inflation rates for one year, noting that in addition to the price of imported goods going up, it’s also likely the price of domestic goods would increase, because U.S. manufacturers would “opportunistically” raise their prices to take advantage of having less competition in the marketplace.', 'Economists also broadly believe Trump’s tariff plan would hurt the U.S. economy, with a May analysis by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) concluding Trump’s campaign trail proposal would “[inflict] significant collateral damage on the US economy,” citing a range of factors including decreased consumer spending, increasing unemployment rates and worse economic growth.', ""Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here."", 'Trump has suggested he will follow through with his campaign pledge for universal tariffs on all imported goods, though it’s still unclear when and what any broader tariffs could look like. “We may, but we’re not ready for that just yet,” Trump said right after his inauguration when asked about whether he’d impose universal tariffs, later saying, “I have it in my mind what it’s going to be but I won’t be setting it yet, but it’ll be enough to protect our country.” Trump’s broader tariff proposal is expected to be higher than the 2.5% import tax rate proposed by incoming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with Trump saying Monday he wants the tax to be “much bigger.”', 'PROMOTED', '$1,700. That’s how much Trump’s tariff proposals would cost middle-class U.S. households in increased taxes each year, as projected by PIIE based on a 10% tariff rate. The think tank also estimated for those in the bottom half of U.S. income brackets, Trump’s tariff proposals would reduce households’ after-tax income by approximately 3.5%. The left-leaning Center for American Progress has estimated a $3,900 annual cost to middle-class Americans if Trump levied 20% tariffs on most imported goods—which is still below the rate he’s set for Mexico and Canada.', '“No study of the Trump tariffs has found any evidence that U.S. tariffs result in lower prices for U.S. importers,” economists at PIIE wrote in a May analysis. “On the contrary, study after study has shown that U.S. tariffs levied since 2017 have instead been fully ‘passed through’ to American buyers.”', '""President Trump successfully imposed tariffs on China in his first term AND cut taxes for hardworking Americans here at home—and he will do it again in his second term,” Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Forbes in a statement before the election when asked about the criticism against Trump’s tariff plan, claiming the ex-president’s “plan will result in millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars returning home from China to America.” The Trump transition team has not yet responded to a request for comment on criticism of Trump’s plan targeting Canada, Mexico and China specifically.', 'Exclusive Invitation: Save up to 60% on a Forbes Membership', '', '', '', 'While only targeting goods from Canada, Mexico and China, Trump’s initial tariff plans will still affect a broad range of imports. Canada is the U.S.’s biggest provider of crude oil, with the Canadian government pointing out Monday the country provided 60% of the U.S.’s supply last year. The northern country also provides transportation equipment, metals, chemicals and processed foods to the U.S., according to data reported by the International Trade Administration. Mexico is the U.S.’s biggest trade partner in terms of imports, according to the ITA, with the U.S. importing goods including computer products, other electronics, electrical equipment, appliances, machinery and oil. The country is also the biggest provider of cars and car parts to the U.S., CNN reports, citing the Commerce Department. China is responsible for a wide range of U.S. imports, with the ITA citing computer and electronic products, electrical equipment, appliances, machinery, fabricated metal products (like bolts and screws, cutlery, cans, car parts and other metal items) and other miscellaneous manufactured goods as the biggest imports going to the U.S.', 'It remains to be seen if any of Trump’s tariff hikes would be coupled with tax cuts that would lessen the impact on American consumers, and Trump has previously floated the idea of replacing income taxes with tariffs, which economists have criticized as being insufficient to cover the funds raised through income taxes. Trump would likely be able to increase tariffs unilaterally without Congress, the Wall Street Journal notes, arguing while the ex-president could encounter some difficulties in imposing a 10% tariff rate across the board, he could take a more piecemeal approach that would alleviate logistical concerns. It’s also unclear how other countries will respond to any Trump tariff increases and if they could retaliate against the U.S. with tariffs of their own, as China did after Trump imposed tariffs against it during his first term. PIIE fellow and former Obama administration staffer Maury Obstfeld told CNN before the election that the conflict “could have a destabilizing effect on financial markets,” predicting “China would retaliate massively” and “other trading partners would be unlikely to take it laying down.”', 'While Harris attacked Trump’s tariff proposal on the campaign trail, the Biden administration largely kept Trump-era tariffs in place, and announced some new tariffs against Chinese imports in May that affect $18 billion worth of goods, blaming “China’s unfair trade practices.” (Trump’s proposed blanket tariffs on China would affect more than $400 billion worth of imports.)

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Why the tariffs might — and might not — still happen.', 'by Eric Levitz', 'Donald Trump has incoherent and unhinged beliefs about trade policy.', 'He also has a penchant for pretending to be a “crazy guy” for the sake of increasing his leverage in negotiations.', 'This made it difficult to tell whether his proposal for an across-the-board 25 percent tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports was sincere. That policy was supposed to take effect Tuesday. But a flurry of last-minute diplomacy on Monday yielded agreements that postponed the onset of the tariffs for 30 days, while the US and its neighbors worked on shoring up security along America’s northern and southern borders.', 'In exchange for the delay of these tariffs, the Mexican government agreed to send 10,000 national guard troops to its northern border while Trump vowed to stem the flow of American firearms into Mexico. Canada, meanwhile, pledged to implement its 1.3 billion border security plan (which it had already enacted in December). Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he was “very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.”', 'For now, it looks like Trump’s avowed desire to upend North American trade — if not to coerce Canada into becoming a US state — was more negotiating ploy than agenda. Or at least, it appears that Trump was not sufficiently committed to that agenda to stick by it, even in the face of overwhelming industry opposition.', 'This said, Trump did not withdraw his proposed tariffs — he only shelved them for one month. There is a strong case for thinking that those tariffs will never take effect. But there is also some reason to fear that he might revive his plans for a North American trade war, if perhaps in more modest form.', 'There are at least three reasons to think that Trump will delay his 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico indefinitely:', 'The economic consequences of Trump’s tariffs would be punishing. Altogether, his newly proposed duties would cost the typical US household more than $1,200 a year, according to an analysis from the Peterson Institute of International Economics. And this de facto tax increase would be regressive, burdening lower-income households more than wealthy ones, as the former spend a greater share of their incomes on foreign consumer goods.', 'Economic nationalists might frame this as the necessary price of revitalizing American manufacturing. Yet high tariffs on Canada and Mexico would also have devastating consequences for US producers. The North American economy has been structured around the presumption of near-zero tariffs for three decades now. American automakers have constructed supply chains that stretch across our nation’s northern and southern borders: Different stages in the production of a car component often take place in different countries, with inputs being sent from back and forth across borders as many as eight times before the finished product is complete.', 'If US carmakers need to pay a 25 percent tax each time they purchase a car part from a Canadian or Mexican supplier, their costs of production will soar. By one estimate, Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico would add $60 billion in costs to the industry. And firms would seek to pass on those costs to consumers. The consultancy Wolfe Research has estimated that the price of a new car would jump by about $3,000, according to Bloomberg.', 'Meanwhile, the National Association of Home Builders warned over the weekend that imposing steep tariffs on housing materials and lumber from Canada and Mexico would lead to a slowdown in residential construction, at a time when America is suffering an acute housing shortage (and the rebuilding of Los Angeles is already taxing our nation’s supply of construction labor and materials).', 'More broadly, Trump’s tariffs would increase the value of the dollar, which means that US-made goods would become more expensive for foreign consumers (and that’s before considering the retaliatory tariffs that Trump’s moves would provoke). Thus, his policy would render American exporters’ goods less competitive in global markets, while also forcing up their costs of production by imposing a tax on foreign-made inputs.', 'Given that Trump’s tariffs would hurt almost all voters and business interests aligned with his party, it’s reasonable to suspect that they will eventually be withdrawn.', 'The second reason to think that Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada will never take effect is that they were officially intended to fight “a drug war,” not a trade war. Trump claims that our neighbors to the north and south have been abetting the transfer of fentanyl and undocumented immigrants into the United States — and that this constitutes a “national emergency.” This was the legal basis for Trump to enact the tariffs immediately, under the auspices of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).', 'If the point of Trump’s tariffs was not to restructure the North American economy — but merely to persuade Canada and Mexico to increase their border control efforts — then the three countries should have little difficulty negotiating a lasting economic peace.', 'The third reason to think that Trump will eventually withdraw his tariffs on Canada and Mexico is that we’ve seen this movie before.', 'In 2019, Trump promised to slap a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports — and increase it steadily to 25 percent — if Mexico failed to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants entering the United States. After Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to reinstate the “Remain in Mexico” migration policies, the tariff threat was dropped.', 'What’s more, in 2017, Trump reportedly told his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, to tell South Korean officials that America’s president was “so crazy,” he could pull out of the US-Korean trade deal “any minute” if he didn’t get concessions.', 'Thus, at times in the past, Trump has tried to make his intentions on trade policy appear more extreme than they were in actuality, for the sake of gaining leverage in negotiations.', 'All this said, there are still three reasons to think that Trump may yet revive his North American trade war:', 'Although White House officials — such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett — have taken pains to portray Trump’s tariff as a response to the fentanyl crisis, this appears to be a legal nicety.', 'Over the weekend, Trump posted on Truth Social:', 'We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!', 'He further lamented that “The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the “Stupid Country” any longer. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!”', 'These are not complaints about Canadian or Mexican drug policy. Rather, they are arguments for blowing up the North American trade system because it leads America to run trade deficits with Canada and Mexico — which means that the US is “subsidizing” those countries.', 'This is awful economic analysis. The fact that America purchases more goods from Canada than vice versa does not mean that we are subsidizing that country. You purchase more goods from your grocery store than it purchases from you. In that sense, you run a “trade deficit” with your grocer. But it does not follow that when you hand over your currency in exchange for a shopping cart full of food, you have just made a charitable donation to Kroger.', 'Nevertheless, Trump complains far more often about the fundamental undesirability of trade with Canada than about that nation’s supposed laxity about stopping fentanyl exports.', 'Separately, he reiterated on Monday that he would like to use tariffs to coerce Canada into accepting its annexation by the United States.', 'Suffice to say, “Canada still isn’t the 51st state” probably does not qualify as a national emergency that would legally justify extraordinary economic measures from the president. For this reason, the Trump administration likely faces a legal imperative to minimize the ambitions behind the president’s tariff policy.', 'The second reason to think that Trump will stick to his guns on tariffs is that he’s been making the same arguments about trade for nearly 40 years.', '“A lot of people are tired of watching other countries ripping off the United States,” Trump said of America’s trade deficit in 1987. “They laugh at us behind our backs. They laugh at us because of our own stupidity.”', 'Trump had no motivation at that time to pretend to believe that trade is a zero-sum exchange — in which the country running a surplus is the winner, and one running a deficit is the loser. The man was still a real estate mogul at that time, not a federal official, so his remarks could not have been intended as a mere diplomatic ploy.', 'Finally, Trump’s decision to keep his tariffs relatively modest during his first term may say more about the team that was around him at that time than it does about his own pragmatism.', 'In 2017, Trump reportedly came extremely close to suddenly withdrawing the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It took the concerted lobbying of his cabinet to stay his hand (a feat that was only achieved by presenting him with maps that suggested Trump voters would be disproportionately harmed by a collapse of trade with Canada and Mexico). Trump ultimately renegotiated and retitled NAFTA, dubbing his new version, The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).', 'Indeed, Trump tried to pursue a wide variety of radical and impulsive policies — from withdrawing the US from NATO or bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities — only to have his inner circle deter him or slow-walk his orders.', 'But his advisers do not seem inclined to check his impulses this time around. To the contrary, they have expedited the execution of Trump’s most harebrained ideas, such as releasing dammed waters into California’s Central Valley — a policy ostensibly aimed at fighting wildfires in Los Angeles, but which in practice accomplished little beyond endangering homeless people, overwhelming local water managers, and depleting a water supply that Golden State farmers will need to draw on come spring and summer.', 'In the end, it seems much more likely than not that Trump will beat a full retreat on his 25 percent tariffs. Although a new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports is still slated to take effect Tuesday, the president plans to renegotiate the USMCA in 2026. To this point, whenever Trump’s idiosyncratic impulses have come into blatant conflict with his corporate backers’ core interests, the latter have taken precedence.', 'Yet the threat that Trump will eventually pursue profoundly costly protectionist policies cannot be fully dismissed.

WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump posted, in all capital letters, on his Truth Social platform.', 'The message, which appeared in the hour before Trump arrived to his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club for the second day in a row, amounted to an advance warning. Trump is serious about fulfilling his campaign promises to end illegal immigration, curb the flow of deadly drugs and rebalance continental trade.', 'But doing so will be uncomfortable, Trump is suggesting, and could serve to undermine another of his top campaign vows: lowering costs for Americans.', '“WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” Trump wrote. “WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”', 'Instead of the new trade war lowering grocery or fuel prices, Trump on Sunday pointed to a result he never mentioned when he was running for president: annexing Canada as an American state.', '“Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!” he said, repeating an idea he’s floated repeatedly since winning the election late last year.', 'As industries brace for the new tariffs — 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China — it remains to be seen how long it will take for higher costs to have an impact on American consumers. The tariffs are set to go into effect Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. ET.', 'In a tacit acknowledgement that upside pressures could affect Americans’ gas and heating costs, Trump levied only a 10% tariff on Canadian oil and gas.', 'Already, Canada and Mexico have moved to retaliate — reluctantly, in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said during a somber address from Ottawa late Saturday: “We don’t want to be here.”', 'Canada’s former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is running to replace Trudeau as prime minister, said her country would rather not get into a trade war with the US but is determined to stand up for itself.', '“We don’t want to have this fight, but we are not going to lose it,” she told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, calling it a “lose-lose” situation that will end up hurting Americans, since they depend on Canada for many basic goods.', 'If the back-and-forth tariffs remain in place for a prolonged period, the “pain” Trump warned of could become a reality.', 'Sen. Tim Kaine argued Sunday on “State of the Union” that Americans will see increased prices at the pump within days and that American businesses will be harmed once the other nations’ retaliatory tariffs kick in.', '“I’m struck by the irony. Last week, the president signed an emergency order regarding energy. There’s an energy emergency. And he just put a 10% tariff on energy from Canada?” the Virginia Democrat told CNN’s Jake Tapper, adding, “The emergency is self-created.”', 'Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, which Trump won by more than 30 percentage points in the 2024 election, warned of the potential impacts on the state’s bourbon industry after the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario directed their liquor boards to remove American alcohol from shelves.', 'But even some Trump allies have privately hoped that after implementing the harsh new duties — and proving to the world he’s willing to act decisively — Trump could eventually ease up, as long as he’s extracted some concessions.', 'Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs “are designed to bring about change.

Financial stocks also weighed on the index. A private-sector survey released on Monday showed that Japan’s factory activity contracted at the fastest rate in 10 months in January due to weak demand. Meanwhile, a summary of opinions from the Bank of Japan’s January meeting showed that concerns over the impact of Trump’s policies and the U.S. economic outlook were major topics of discussion. “The policies of the new U.S. administration will gradually become clear, and they are likely to affect Japan’s economy in various ways. However, the resilience of Japan’s economy as a whole has increased enough to withstand some downward stress,” one of the BOJ’s nine policy board members stated at the meeting. The summary also showed that the board believes further interest rate hikes are necessary.

Trump keeps threatening Canada’s sovereignty and and vowing to put sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products, though Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday afternoon the tariffs will be postponed by at least 30 days after he promised more cooperation on the border.', 'WATCH: A look at how tariffs work and the impact they have on the economy', 'In Canada, discussion and disapproval are everywhere. Canadian hockey fans have even been booing the American national anthem at recent National Hockey League games. Addressing the nation this past weekend, Trudeau channeled the betrayal that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. “We were always there standing with you, grieving with you, the American people,” he said.', 'The Canadian jitters, some worry, could go beyond the moment. “The damage is going to be long-lasting,” said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto. “The Americans won’t be trusted anymore. The 51st state stuff is just contemptuous. It treats Canada like we don’t even exist.”', 'The ties between the two countries are without parallel. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.5 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the United States. Each day, about 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.', '“He wants to come after us?” said Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province of Ontario. He has said that it feels like being stabbed in the heart by a family member. “I’ve yet to hear one American citizen say Canada is the problem,” he said.', 'Some Canadians are circulating lists of Canadian products they can buy instead of American items and others are canceling vacation plans to the United States. The U.S. Travel Association said the tariffs on Canada could impact Canadian visitation to and spending in the United States, noting that Canada is the top source of international visitors to the United States, with 20.4 million visits last year.', '“What he is doing now is unprecedented and highly damaging for the relationship. … He is eroding Canadians’ trust towards the U.S. in ways that will make it hard to repair the relationship,” said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. He says many Canadians feel betrayed by Trump’s threats and attitude, especially because the two countries have long enjoyed strong economic, cultural and geographic ties.', '“It’s certainly one of the worst moments in Canada-U.S. relations since the creation of Canada in 1867,” Beland said. “His talk about making Canada the 51st state is a direct attack against the country’s sovereignty. Even if we exclude that threat, he shows no respect for Canada’s sovereignty and institutions.”', 'Canadian officials said they are applying 25% retaliatory tariffs to American imports including beverages, cosmetics and paper products. A second phase will be even more punishing.', 'Trudeau did hold out hope that Trump wouldn’t “punish” Canada. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum put their planned tariffs on hold Monday for a month to give time for further negotiations, and Mexico said it planned to deploy 10,000 members of its national guard to address drug trafficking.', 'Trudeau noted that the United States and Canada have built the most successful economic, military and security partnership the world has ever seen — a relationship that, he says, has been the envy of the world.', '“As President John F. Kennedy said many years ago, geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends, economics has made us partners and necessity has made us allies,” he said.', 'Trump also plans to put a 10% tariff on Canadian energy. Underscoring the potential effects, Canada provides more than 4.3 million barrels of oil a day to the United States. The U.S. tends to consume about 20 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It has been producing domestically about 13.2 million barrels.', 'Yet Trump keeps saying the United States doesn’t need Canada for anything and said again Monday that he’d like to see Canada become the 51st state. And his vice president dismisses Canada, too.', '“Spare me the sob story about how Canada is our ‘best friend.’ I love Canada and have many Canadian friends. But is the government meeting their NATO target for military spending?

"Donald Trump’s trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China explained visually",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/4/donald-trumps-trade-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-explained-visually,"['Mexico, Canada and China account for more than 40 percent of total goods traded with the United States.', 'The United States has postponed planned 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports by a month, following 11th-hour calls between President Donald Trump and leaders from Canada and Mexico on Monday.', 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to boost border security to prevent the trafficking of drugs and migrants into the US, averting a trade war for now.', 'But the 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods took effect on Tuesday, attracting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Chinese goods have already been subjected to previous tariffs starting in Trump’s first term between 2017 and 2021.', 'The tariff war by the US, the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, has rattled markets worldwide. From January to November 2024, the value of goods traded between the US and the world reached $4.88 trillion, with $2.98 trillion in exports and $1.90 trillion in imports.', 'The United States’s top trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 40 percent of total goods traded, valued at more than $2 trillion.', '', 'A tariff is a government-imposed tax on imported goods and services, paid by businesses bringing them into the country. Designed to protect domestic industries, tariffs often drive up costs for consumers by making foreign products more expensive, potentially reducing demand.', 'For example:', 'Following talks with Trump, Mexican President Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau both made commitments to bolster security at their shared borders with the US.', '“I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.', 'Following his call with Trump, Trudeau announced that Canada would move forward with its previously outlined $1.3bn border plan, while also committing to appointing a “fentanyl czar” and officially designating cartels as “terrorist” organisations.', '“Fundamentally it’s very good news that tariffs have been paused and Canada needs to do everything possible to engage with Trump – work on border security issues etc,” Vina Nadjibulla, vice president, research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.', '“But beyond the immediate crisis, we need to work on structural issues that led to this over-dependence on the US. We need to build capacity to export [to places other than the] US and invest in our own competitiveness,” Nadjibulla added.', 'No, tariffs have been used by several countries before. Historically, in the US from 1790 to 1860, tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue.', 'Tariffs can also be used to “punish” a foreign producer of goods for not abiding by international trade practices. In 2018, the US began placing tariffs on Chinese goods worth hundreds of billions citing unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. This marked the start of the US-China trade war, where items such as semiconductors, batteries and electronics such as washing machines were taxed.', 'In the same year, Trump also introduced a 25 percent levy on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminium, affecting a number of countries including Canada, Mexico, India, Brazil and Argentina.', '', '', '', 'Tariffs are often used to protect certain domestic industries from foreign competitors. This happens by increasing the price of those imported goods. The notion behind tariffs is that buyers will choose domestic products over expensive foreign imports, which in turn will help the domestic industry grow. However, this isn’t always the case.', 'For example, for the US to produce avocados – 90 percent of which are imported from Mexico – would be a long and arduous feat given that avocados are produced in just three states: California, Florida and Hawaii.', 'During Trump’s presidential campaign, he promised to impose tariffs on the US’s biggest trading partners in retaliation over undocumented migrants and the flow of drugs, especially fentanyl.', 'Trump also emphasised using tariffs as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and encourage foreign businesses to establish factories within the US territory.', 'Tariffs are also used to generate revenue for a country with the extra income from the taxes levied on imported goods being used for public spending. For example, in 2019, $79bn of revenue was generated in tariffs, double the value from 2017, according to the Brookings Institution. However, the majority of this burden was passed on to consumers who paid higher prices.', '“During 2018-2020, President Trump mainly used tariffs as a bargaining chip,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “This time, the motivations seem broader, including a desire to bring more manufacturing back to the US, shift the tax burden away from income taxes and onto tariffs, and use tariffs both as leverage and as punishment. We’re looking at a much larger scale than we saw under Trump’s first term.”', 'A range of goods will be heavily affected by Trump’s imposed tariffs. Based on what the US imports the most from Canada, Mexico and China, this will include items such as cars, fuel, computers and electrical equipment. Food items like avocados are also likely to see a price increase.', 'Trump signed three executive orders placing 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil and an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods.', 'Canada is a large exporter of crude oil with 97 percent of its crude oil exports going to the US in 2023, while Mexico exports a large amount of produce such as fruit and vegetable as well as automobile parts.', 'China is a major exporter of electrical equipment and electronics including chips, laptops and smartphones.', 'Canada, Mexico and China have all stated that they would react with retaliatory tariffs. Trudeau had said on Saturday that a 25 percent levy would be slapped on a slew of US imports, which have subsequently been paused.', 'Beijing criticised the latest tariff, saying it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), an intergovernmental body responsible for regulating international trade. China has placed counter-tariffs on US imports that will come into effect on February 10.', 'Under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, US trade representatives wield power to counteract unfair trade practices by foreign countries. This has been at the heart of Washington’s trade war with China since 2018 when tariffs were placed on the world’s largest exporter.', 'In a significant move, the Biden administration expanded these tariffs in September 2024 to target items such as electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and solar panels, with levies ranging between 25-100 percent.', '', '“It appears there’s a temporary pause on tariffs against Mexico and Canada. However, tariffs on China are likely to take effect on February 4, and President Trump has signalled additional tariffs against the EU and others. So yes, we could be heading into a trade war,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.', '“In response, countries will likely adopt a range of strategies – from direct retaliation to hedging their trade relationships among the US, China, and other partners. Globally, we can expect inflationary effects and significant disruptions to supply chains.”', '“Yes. Both the tariffs themselves and any mitigation measures – such as subsidies or support programmes for affected sectors – will contribute to inflation,” Nadjibulla said. “Higher prices associated with tariffs, combined with the cost of remedy efforts, will lead to inflationary pressures overall.”', '“Where possible, buying local products and avoiding certain imports may help consumers manage rising costs,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.', 'But they cannot completely escape the inflationary pressure triggered by the tariff war.', 'Yes, in most cases the cost of items will go up. This is not just final product goods, but capital goods too, which would increase production costs and result in higher costs for final products. Additionally, higher costs for raw materials and parts would raise prices through the supply chain.', 'According to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), a US-based nonprofit organisation researching the global economy, machinery and electronics will face the largest import tax – given they are mostly sourced from China and because they currently face low tariff rates.', 'Other US imports from China likely to be hit the hardest would also include toys and sporting equipment.', 'Ultimately the consumer. US-based businesses will face paying higher taxes. In most cases, the cost of tariffs is indirectly picked up by consumers as importing businesses are likely to increase the price of said goods to manage the taxes levied.', '“Consumers will shoulder much of the burden through higher prices, but businesses will also feel the impact. Industries such as the Canadian and US auto sectors may be especially hard-hit,” Nadjibulla from the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada said.', 'In theory, the imposition of tariffs would encourage more domestic production, which, in turn, would require more employment. Similarly, if foreign companies are being encouraged to bring their factories to the United States, it would increase employment.', 'For example, after Trump imposed 20-50 percent tariffs on washing machines, more jobs were brought to two regions where appliances were not previously manufactured: Clarksville, Tennessee and Newberry, South Carolina.', 'In 2018, LG completed an investment in a new smart factory in Clarksville, to be staffed with 700 employees. Similarly, in 2018, Samsung built an appliance manufacturing facility in Newberry, South Carolina, hiring 1,000 employees.', 'The US administration would hope the latest tariff war will incentivise corporations to set up more factories and businesses in the US.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"

The opening salvos have been fired in Trump's trade war - what comes next?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vdjpj7pe3o,"['Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.', ""Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days."", 'But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?', ""China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant."", ""Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power."", 'This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.', 'Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.', 'He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.', 'The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.', ""Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to."", 'That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.', ""The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process."", ""The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come."", ""That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America."", ""These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?"", ""Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?"", ""The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage."", 'What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?', ""Netanyahu's far-right allies will cheer the proposal, but Arab nations will see it as ethnic cleansing of Palestinians."", 'The full Senate voted in the evening, approving Bondi as the next attorney general, tasked with running the Department of Justice.', ""The BBC's Analysis Editor takes a look at the latest round of tariffs announced by President Trump - and what the US has got in return."", 'Benjamin Netanyahu praised the idea and called the US president the ""greatest friend Israel has ever had"" in the White House.', 'Delhi hopes tariff cuts have put it ahead of the game - but will that satisfy Trump, or is trade action still on the table?', 'Copyright 2025 BBC.

Venkatesh Prasad, senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research, said modern vehicle production in Mexico began with components before full-vehicle production was gradually introduced.

', '“We were running over $100 billion trade deficit in 2023, most of it in the auto sector,” Shaiken told the Free Press. “U.S. shareholders are enjoying the gains, but the benefits are largely bypassing U.S. workers.”', 'More:Detroit chamber, Fain criticize Trump tariffs; list of affected automakers', '[ STAY UP TO DATE:Sign up forour Daily Briefing newsletter today to get the Free Press in your inbox. ]', 'Though much has changed since the earliest days of automotive manufacturing, the ties that link the Detroit Three to Mexico go back 100 years.', 'In 1925, Ford Motor Co. opened a new company in Mexico City and built its first assembly plant there five years later. The plant had 260 employees and produced five Model Ts a day. Over time, production expanded to include the Model A, Mercury Cougar and Ford Mustang.', 'One advantage offered by the Mexican government was a 50% discount on import duties on inputs, rail freight tariff concessions and the promise of no union workers.', 'General Motors and Chrysler followed suit, with both having started Mexican vehicle production by 1938. ', 'Automotive parts production in Mexico flourished in the 1960s with the creation of maquiladoras, foreign manufacturing facilities through which companies can import vehicle parts or assembly products without paying tax. The goal of the duty-free facilities was to encourage international investment in production, while foreign countries like the U.S. and Canada would benefit from cheaper labor.', 'In the 1970s and 1980s, the influx of Japanese automakers prompted further investment in Mexico, as U.S. automakers sought to offshore labor and cost-intensive production. ', 'The establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 also made it easier for companies to move goods across the continent without paying duties. The revised agreement signed during Trump’s first term still supports this process. ', 'Mexican wages are far lower than those in the U.S., with Mexican autoworkers making roughly about 10% of their northern neighbors today. Nonetheless, Shaiken said, “What I’ve found on the ground in many plants in Mexico is, in fact, Mexican productivity is comparable or even higher than U.S. productivity, and the quality is very high,” he said. ', 'Shaiken calls it “high productivity poverty” — Mexican workers produce great products but aren’t earning a living wage.', '“That affects U.S. workers because the combination of high productivity and low wages attracts investment, plants are closed here that are in many cases opened there,” he said. “But Mexican workers are also short-changed. They have small parking lots in Mexican auto factories because workers can’t afford the products they produce.”', 'Trade relationships with Canada go back just as far as Mexico but workplaces are different thanks to the country’s strong unions. They also began with Henry Ford, who built his first Canadian automotive plant in 1904, largely to escape tariffs levied on Canadian imports.', 'A vestige of carriage production, the 35% tariff on vehicles coming into Canada prompted the Detroit automaker to set up branch operations across the river, according to Dimitry Anastakis, the L.R. Wilson and R.J. Currie Chair in Canadian Business History at the University of Toronto. ', '“It makes no sense to have a Ford Motor Plant in Detroit and a Ford Motor Plant in Windsor, but that’s exactly what happened because of the tariff wall,” he said. ', ""This lasted until the 1960s, when Canada launched a trade war of its own against the United States after the invention of the automatic transmission, which flooded the Canadian market with vehicles made in Canada, and thus not subject to the tariff. By then, only U.S. companies' branch plants remained in operation due to the scale and investment the auto industry requires."", 'In 1965, the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement was enacted, a precursor to NAFTA that removed tariffs between the two countries. This led to increased auto manufacturing in Canada and more jobs. The agreement was abolished in 2001, but by then NAFTA had more or less superseded it. ', 'Without tariffs getting in the way, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler were able to “rationalize” their production in North America, including their Canadian facilities, to streamline and focus on the continent rather than one market at a time.', 'The effects were immediate and profound. In 1963, before the auto pact, out of the 632,000 vehicles built in Canada, a grand total of 921 were exported to the United States. In 1973, with the auto pact in full bloom, Canada built 1,589,000 vehicles and exported 1,092,000 of them to the United States.', ""“In the '60s and '70s, the Canadian industry was integrated right into the American industry,” Anastakis said. "", ""As for labor, in its earliest incarnation, Canada’s union presence was an extension of the UAW, formed in 1937 following a strike at General Motors's Oshawa, Ontario, plant. "", 'Under Bob White, the legendary president of the Canadian Auto Workers, the branch split off and formed an independent union in 1984. Since then, it has merged with others to form Unifor in 2013. ', '“Canada has good labor laws. In a number of ways, they’re better than the U.S.,” Shaiken said.

Together, we build best-in-class cars and trucks that remain the envy of the world,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in an emailed statement. “Unionized autoworkers fought for and won gold standard collective agreements that created good jobs, raised living standards and built strong, vibrant communities.”', 'She added: “Two-way trade in automotive goods is about $160 billion per year and split virtually down the middle in near perfect balance.

With President Donald Trump’s decision over the week to declare a specious “emergency” for the purpose of slapping crippling tariffs on his continental neighbors, that era has come to an end. What follows now is, well, hard to predict.', 'More on:', 'Trade', 'Tariffs', 'Mexico', 'Canada', 'China', 'Trump’s signature accomplishment in his first term was to renegotiate the rules of trade in North America, creating what Canada and Mexico believed would be a solid foundation for their economies for the next generation. Each of those two countries has built its economy around exports to its larger neighbor. As my CFR colleague Shannon K. O’Neil has argued, the closely knit supply chains in North America are not just beneficial for those smaller economies, they are the foundation of competitiveness across the region.', 'Yet the United States will now impose, starting Tuesday, tariffs of 25 percent against most Canadian and Mexican goods; in a small sop to the politically sympathetic Canadian province of Alberta, and to U.S. gasoline buyers, the tariffs on oil and other energy exports will be limited to 10 percent. China, which Trump had threatened during his campaign with tariffs as high as 60 percent, was also hit with new 10 percent tariffs on top of the existing ones from Trump’s first term, which had been maintained by the Joe Biden administration.', 'Trump has alleged that the new tariffs are necessary to stop illegal migration and the smuggling of fentanyl—in the case of Canada and Mexico—and against China because of its failure to halt the production and distribution of illicit fentanyl. ', 'The sense of betrayal on both sides of our shared borders is impossible to overestimate. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau—in announcing reluctantly his nation’s plans to impose retaliatory tariffs—used the press conference to recount the century of loyal friendship from Canada. “From the beaches of Normandy to the mountains of the Korean peninsula, from the fields of Flanders to the streets of Kandahar, we have fought and died alongside you during your darkest hours,” he said. David Eby, premier of the west coast province of British Columbia, called it “a complete betrayal of the historic bond between our countries and a declaration of economic war against a trusted ally,”', 'Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the Trump’s administration’s rationale for the tariffs as “slander” and called on the United States to fix its own broken system of public health and addiction treatment.', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Amidst the recriminations, other countries and companies across the world—including other close allies—are desperately looking for some method of coping with Trump’s sudden escalation of trade warfare. Modern capitalism is impressively adaptable—most companies can probably figure out how to thrive in a world of tariffs nearly as well as they did in the world of freer trade. But a world of randomly imposed tariffs, for an unpredictable set of reasons, makes rational planning all but impossible. ', 'Since the United States started walking away from the World Trade Organization (WTO) a decade ago—tiptoeing during the Barack Obama administration and then stampeding during the first Trump and Biden administrations—there have been efforts to restore greater order and predictability to global trade. The WTO was the most comprehensive and ambitious set of international economic rules ever constructed, but in the end its reach exceeded its grasp. Narrow national interests almost always triumph over sermons about the virtues of “a rules-based system.”', 'Yet until last month, it seemed that some framework of rules would survive. When Trump renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement into the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), he proclaimed it “the largest, most significant, modern, and balanced trade agreement in history. All of our countries will benefit greatly.” Most of the new tariffs he imposed in his first term were aimed at China, which was emerging as not just an economic competitor, but a growing security threat.', 'President Biden built on the same premise. He continued to tighten the screws on China, especially restricting exports of high-technology goods. And his administration encouraged allies to engage in what came to be known as “friendshoring,” in which companies were encouraged to shift investments away from China to more reliable low-cost partners like Mexico and Vietnam. An announcement by Trump to escalate those tariffs significantly on China—during the campaign he had bragged he would impose tariffs as high as 60 percent—seemed a logical extension of the strategy.', 'Instead, in his first weeks back in office, Trump has threatened and imposed tariffs in an utterly random, incomprehensible fashion. To impose the new tariffs on Canada and Mexico, Trump is using the extraordinary powers granted by Congress under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to declare a national crisis over unauthorized migration and imported fentanyl. There are few historical examples, and no significant ones, for the United States using the tariff weapon to achieve such utterly unrelated policy goals. ', 'The United States is now signaling that tariffs are an all-purpose club to be used for whatever policy goal the president wishes. “Tariffs are a powerful, proven source of leverage for protecting the national interest,” said the White House fact sheet released with Saturday’s tariff announcement.', 'That formula will create enormous—in many ways unprecedented—uncertainty not just in North America, but in the entire global economy. Trump has already used the tariff threat against Colombia over deportation of migrants from the United States and has threatened it against the BRICS countries over their plans to de-dollarize. There is no reason to think it will end there. The United States has expansive national interests across the world, so it is hard to think of a country that could not find itself facing Trump’s tariff weapon.', 'Trump’s endgame is hard to deduce. Will trade return closer to normal when U.S. trade deficits shrink? When global use of the U.S. dollar rises (beyond its already very high level)? When fentanyl overdoses decline in the United States? When unauthorized migration to the U.S. falls more, even though the numbers today are the lowest in years. When the tariffs raise enough revenue that Trump can cut taxes further? It may be any or all of these. Or Trump could just keep inventing new rationales to impose tariffs.', 'Perhaps the chaos will bring some benefits to the United States. In an unpredictable world, investment might seek safe haven in the large U.S. consumer market. But there are many other less sanguine possibilities. Capital might again flow to China, which will be eager to expand trade with the countries Trump is abandoning. Or companies might just sit on their dollars, waiting for some clearer sign that new rules and agreements are being reached that will bring greater predictability back to trade.', 'Retaliatory actions are also difficult to predict. Canada and Mexico have both announced in-kind tariff responses, but the Trump administration has warned that will only result in still higher tariffs. That could lead to all sorts of asymmetrical retaliation, with the countries restricting exports of oil or other critical goods to the United States. With Trump coveting territorial expansion in North America, it is hard to know where such escalation might end.', 'Scholars will debate for many years the pros and cons of the old rules-based system, whether its benefits in expanding global wealth offset the costs in rising inequality both across and within nations. But it’s hard to imagine there will be contention over whether a world with some agreed trade rules is better than a world with none. That was a lesson the world seemed to have learned thoroughly from the economic conflicts of the 1920s and 30s and the wars that followed.

Trump’s Trade War Is Only Getting Going,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/trumps-trade-war-is-only-getting-going,"['On Wall Street, it’s called Trump-induced volatility, and the message of the past few days is that investors—and everybody else—had better get used to it. At the weekend, the President made good on a signature campaign promise, imposing twenty-five per cent levies on Mexican and Canadian goods and ten per cent on Chinese imports. On Monday, after Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican President, said that she would send ten thousand troops to fight drug smuggling at the southern border, the White House said it was suspending the tariffs for a month. Later in the day, Trump spoke with Justin Trudeau, the outgoing Prime Minister of Canada, who made a similar pledge, and came away with a similar pause.', 'Both Mexico and Canada are acutely vulnerable to such pressure: the U.S. accounts for about eighty per cent of their trade. Trump, for his part, was under a lot of pressure from the business world to back down, and when the President paused the tariffs, the pro-free trade editorial page of the Wall Street Journal ran with the headline “Trump Blinks.” In the markets, news of tariffs led to an early sell-off; the market rebounded on the news of the pause. At the close of trading, the S. & P. 500 index was down less than one per cent. On Tuesday, the markets didn’t move much.', 'Some investors are still hoping that Trump’s threat of sanctions is merely a negotiating tactic to force concessions from trading partners. Or, as Scott Bessent, the former hedge-fund manager who is now Treasury Secretary, told the Financial Times in October, “it’s escalate to de-escalate.” Perhaps. But since his Inauguration, Trump has made clear that he plans to upend the international trade system and assert U.S. economic power in ways that are fundamentally antithetical to how the world economy has been organized since after the Second World War—a period in which American inflation-adjusted G.D.P. per capita rose from roughly fifteen thousand dollars to nearly seventy thousand dollars, while, in recent decades, workers’ wages stagnated and inequality increased sharply.', 'Trump campaigned on using trade policy to protect American workers, but his willingness to push around America’s neighbors, Mexico and Canada, as well as Greenland, Colombia, and Panama, is part of a broader agenda that is more accurately described as economic imperialism than as mere protectionism. One definition of economic imperialism is a strong country using its power to exert control over the economic resources and policies of weaker ones. The pretext Trump cited for the tariffs on Mexico and Canada was the inflow of fentanyl. This is certainly a serious problem, posed particularly by Mexican drug cartels: last year, authorities seized ninety-six hundred kilograms of the drug at the southern border. However, the total amount of fentanyl seized at the northern border in 2024 was a mere nineteen kilograms, according to the New York Times. Canada is not a major source of the fentanyl killing Americans, and the real reason for Trump’s animus toward the country appears to be that it runs a trade surplus with the United States and that its leader hasn’t been sufficiently deferential to him.', 'Over the weekend, Trump claimed on his Truth Social account, “We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason.” And on Monday, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he repeated his assertion that Canada should become the fifty-first state. Of course, the United States doesn’t spend a dollar to subsidize Canada. Just as is the case between many advanced economies, a lot of commerce goes on across the U.S.-Canada border. In 2023, Canada imported $440.9 billion worth of U.S. goods and services. To be sure, we also imported a lot of goods and services from Canada: $481.6 billion. This created a bilateral trade deficit of $40.7 billion, equivalent to less than 0.15 per cent of the U.S. G.D.P.—hardly an alarming figure.', 'Moreover, trade in goods and services is only part of the U.S.-Canada economic relationship. Financial capital also moves across the northern border in search of profitable investment opportunities, such as purchases of businesses or real estate. In 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the total stock of Canadian direct investment in the United States was $589.3 billion, compared with U.S. direct investment in Canada of $438.8 billion. In other words, the United States was running a surplus on investment capital. Quite possibly, Trump himself has benefitted from this inflow by selling condos to wealthy Canadians. If he has, he hasn’t mentioned it.', 'As for the trade deficit, much of it is accounted for by energy products, particularly crude oil and natural gas, which Canada exports to the United States in large quantities. If the tariffs go into effect, the price of these products will go up for Americans. Over the weekend, Irving Energy, a Canadian company that supplies propane to Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, warned that it would pass the levies on to its customers. That’s what happens in trade wars.', 'The auto industry plays a key role in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993, U.S. and foreign-owned automakers have reconstituted their manufacturing operations. General Motors, for example, now assembles about forty per cent of the vehicles it sells in the United States in Mexico and Canada. And the level of cross-border integration goes well beyond final assembly. Much of the industry’s supply chain is organized on a continental basis, some parts crossing a border several times before they are shipped out as part of a finished car or truck. As Paul Krugman pointed out in a Substack post, the Trump tariffs threaten to blow up this entire model.', 'And for what? Trump’s rhetoric sometimes suggests that his goal is to make the United States self-sufficient in virtually everything; the last major capitalist economy to achieve such a goal was Nazi Germany. At other times, including over the weekend, he has celebrated tariffs as a revenue source for the federal government, and suggested that they are better than income taxes. But, if tariffs were to become a major source of revenue, they would have to be substantial and permanent. What, then, of “escalate to de-escalate”?', 'It’s surely sufficient to know that Trump regards tariffs as an effective tool to bully other countries, and that his recent experience with Colombia appears to have strengthened this conviction. (After Colombia’s government refused to accept military flights of migrants deported from the United States, Trump slapped heavy tariffs on the country, prompting a quick reversal on Colombia’s part.)', 'On Sunday, Trump signalled that the next step would be the announcement of punitive tariffs on goods from the European Union, which has long been one of his bêtes noires. The way things are going, it wouldn’t be surprising if he singled out Denmark, which exports a lot of medical products, including Ozempic, to the United States, for specially punitive treatment, as a means of pressuring it to make concessions on mineral-rich Greenland, which figures prominently in his imperialist ambitions. (He’s already had one phone call with the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen. The Financial Times reported that it “had gone very badly.”)', 'So far, China, the prime target of Trump’s first-term trade war, has got off relatively lightly, with a ten per cent across-the-board tariff. (During the 2024 campaign, he had threatened a levy of up to sixty per cent.) On Tuesday, China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports of crude oil and natural gas, farm equipment, and certain other vehicles. As many big U.S. firms, including Apple, Intel, and Tesla, remain heavily dependent on Chinese supply chains, the government in Beijing has the capacity to inflict a great deal more hurt on the U.S. economy, but its measured response signalled it is open to negotiations, and some of Trump’s business allies may well be advising him to exercise caution. In the meantime, he is busy bullying the vulnerable and figuring out how far he can take things without creating a financial crash. ♦', 'Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.', 'The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.', 'Gloria Steinem’s life on the feminist frontier.', 'Where the Amish go on vacation.', 'How Colonel Sanders built his Kentucky-fried fortune.', 'What does procrastination tell us about ourselves?', 'Fiction by Patricia Highsmith: “The Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

O'Neil and Julia Huesa"", 'Last updated February 1, 2025 6:38 pm (EST)', 'On February 1, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico—the United States’ largest trading partners. U.S. importers will pay a 25 percent tax on all goods from Canada and Mexico, as Trump tries to force both countries to curb migration and drug trafficking into the United States. Imports from China, meanwhile, will face 10 percent tariffs—punishment for Beijing’s failure to rein in the smuggling of fentanyl precursor chemicals to Canada and Mexico, where they are made into U.S.-bound fentanyl.', 'Here are nine graphics that show the potential economic effects of such tariffs on all four countries.', 'More on:', 'United States', 'Tariffs', 'Canada', 'China', 'Mexico', 'Nearly half of all U.S. imports—more than $1.3 trillion—come from Canada, China, and Mexico. However, analysis by Bloomberg Economics shows that the new tariffs could reduce overall U.S. imports by 15 percent. While the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion per year in extra federal tax revenue, they could also impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and ultimately driving up consumer prices.', 'Certain sectors of the U.S. economy will be hit particularly hard, including the automotive, energy, and food sectors. Gas prices could surge as much as 50 cents per gallon in the Midwest, as Canada and Mexico supply more than 70 percent [PDF] of crude oil imports to U.S. refineries. Also at risk are cars and other vehicles, as the United States imports nearly half its auto parts from its northern and southern neighbors. ', 'A 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico will raise production costs for U.S. automakers, adding up to $3,000 to the price of some of the roughly sixteen million cars sold in the United States each year. Grocery costs could rise, too, as Mexico is the United States’ biggest source of fresh produce, supplying more than 60 percent of U.S. vegetable imports and nearly half of all fruit and nut imports.', 'Still, the United States is less reliant on trade than many other industrialized economies, including Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Imports and exports make up just a quarter of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and the United States sources what it does import from a fairly broad set of nations.', 'Tariffs will hit Canada and Mexico much harder, as trade makes up about 70 percent of both economies’ GDP. ', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The two countries are particularly dependent on trade with the United States. More than 80 percent of Mexico’s exports—including cars, machinery, fruits, vegetables, and medical equipment—head north, accounting for 15 percent of total U.S. imports. This dependence is especially pronounced on Mexico’s northern border. There, industrial states Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Baja California account for nearly half of Mexico’s exports to the United States, sending more than $200 billion worth of computers, electronics, transportation equipment, and other products each year.', 'A unilateral 25 percent tariff on these goods could slash Mexico’s GDP by some 16 percent according to Bloomberg Economics, with Mexico’s auto industry bearing the brunt. Mexico sends nearly 80 percent of the cars it produces to the United States alone, amounting to some 2.5 million vehicles each year. Duties will also threaten Mexico’s energy sector; the United States is the recipient of roughly 60 percent of Mexico’s petroleum exports, most of which is crude oil bound for U.S. refineries. At the same time, Mexico is the top destination for U.S. refined oil exports, which meet over 70 percent of domestic demand. U.S. tariffs will likely make fuel more expensive, raising prices at the pump and straining Mexico’s broader economy.', 'Canada faces a similar challenge. The United States buys more than 70 percent [PDF; in Spanish] of Canada’s exports, with these goods making up 14 percent of total U.S. imports. Under the new tariffs, Canada’s energy sector will take the biggest hit, as exporters send 80 percent of their oil south. ', 'These asymmetries in the cost of tariffs at home give the U.S. significant leverage over its North American partners in negotiations.', 'China is comparatively less dependent on the United States and less reliant on trade overall. Over the past two decades, the country has steadily reduced the importance of trade to its economy as Beijing has ramped up domestic production. Today, imports and exports account for only about 37 percent of China’s GDP, compared to more than 60 percent in the early 2000s. ', 'In recent years, U.S.-China trade has declined, particularly in sectors hit by previous tariffs and export controls, such as auto parts, data servers, furniture, and semiconductors. China has instead ramped up trade with other partners including the European Union, Mexico, and Vietnam. The country’s share of global trade has climbed roughly 4 percent since 2016, when President Trump first took office, even as the United States’ share has dipped. Combined, these factors will lessen the shock of an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.', 'Each country’s currency could weaken further, lessening the bite of tariffs on imports and raising the effective price of U.S. exports to other nations. A weakened yuan has already softened the blow for Chinese producers, helping their exports remain competitive around the world. The roughly 30 percent depreciation of Mexico’s peso since April and the Canadian dollar’s 8 percent drop since September also lessens the potential impact. Markets could potentially drive the peso, as well as the Canadian dollar, further down not that tariffs are in place.', 'Additionally, Canada, China, or Mexico could respond in kind, imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on the United States. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has already suggested that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which underpins North American free trade, would likely allow it.', 'This wouldn’t be the first time countries have reciprocated. In 2018, Mexico and Canada placed retaliatory tariffs on a combined more than $15 billion worth of U.S. goods—including steel, pork, yogurt, and tablecloths—after Trump imposed tariffs on their steel and aluminum. Likewise, the United States lost $20 billion in annual farm exports when China hit back against a slew of U.S. tariffs from 2018 to 2019.', 'If either Canada or Mexico retaliates, U.S. fuel exporters would likely take the biggest hit alongside automakers and other advanced manufacturers, including pharmaceutical producers.', 'Retaliatory tariffs on the United States would predominantly affect manufacturing-heavy states. Mexico buys 70 percent [PDF] of New Mexico’s exports, including billions of dollars in U.S. semiconductor chips and electrical components that later return to the United States in Mexican-made cars and appliances. Texas sends more than $20 billion in chips, auto parts, and electrical equipment to Mexico; overall, the state’s southbound exports account for 5 percent of its GDP.

Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will be a blow to all 3 economies,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-25-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-will-be-a-blow-to-all-3-economies/,"['COMMENTARY', '', 'February 3, 2025', 'Global Trade', 'Geopolitics U.S. Foreign Policy', 'U.S. Trade Policy', 'China', 'Global Economy and Development', 'USMCA initiative', 'The trading relationship between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada is the most important set of trade relations for all three countries. Canada and Mexico are the United States’ first and second largest export markets with goods exports of $680 billion in 2023, and the U.S. is the largest export market for Canada and Mexico. Exports among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada support over 17 million jobs.', 'The trading relationship among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is underpinned by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new trade agreement that replaced NAFTA and was negotiated and finalized during the first Trump administration. Yet, on February 1, 2025, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs (which were subsequently delayed by one month) on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on energy imports from Canada to address flows of fentanyl and illegal migration. Mexico and Canada have indicated they are preparing retaliatory tariffs, and Trump has stated that he will raise U.S. tariffs further in response. The difference in the negative economic impact from the current 10% tariff on energy imports versus a 25% tariff is relatively small. And given that Canada and Mexico look almost certain to retaliate, likely leading to even higher U.S. tariffs, the following assesses the impact of across-the-board 25% tariffs.', 'The impact of these tariffs on trade across North America will be particularly impactful, not only because of the large volume of trade that is involved, but also because of the importance of supply chains, which comprise around 50% of intraregional trade. For example, in the production of a Chevy Silverado or Dodge Challenger, components cross borders multiple times before being assembled into a final product. As a result, imposing a 25% tariff every time a product crosses borders adds up quickly.', 'The following presents the results of simulations based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model under two scenarios. The first scenario assesses the economic impacts on the U.S., Mexico, and Canada with the U.S. imposing across-the-board 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada with no retaliation from Canada or Mexico. The second scenario assesses the impact of Canada and Mexico retaliating with 25% tariffs on U.S. imports. All economic impacts are estimated to occur over the medium term (i.e., over the next three to five years). Given that U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada under USMCA are in most cases close to zero now, a 25% tariff will have significant negative economic shocks for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. In both scenarios, the economic impact is more severe for Mexico and Canada because a much larger share of their trade is with the U.S.—83% of Mexico’s exports and 78% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S., whereas around one-third of U.S. exports are destined for Canada and Mexico. That said, the economic hit to the U.S. is substantial, with some sectors in particular standing to contract significantly.', 'These tariffs will also harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. Continuing to make progress here will require greater trade and investment across North America to strengthen and diversify existing supply chains and reduce reliance on China-centered supply chains. The tariffs are directly at odds with deeper economic integration across North America. In fact, China will benefit from a trade war across North America, as it undercuts efforts to reshore supply chains away from China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, they signal to the world that any international agreement with the U.S. is not worth all that much, raising difficult questions for all U.S. allies and trading partners about the value of trade agreements with the U.S. One result is that countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China.', 'Figure 1 shows that tariffs would reduce U.S. GDP growth by around 0.25 percentage points, and with retaliation, U.S. GDP growth falls over 0.3 percentage points. With U.S. GDP in 2024 of approximately $23.5 trillion, this amounts to an estimated loss of U.S. economic output over the medium term of around $45 billion from the 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and this rises to about $75 billion in lost economic output should Canada and Mexico retaliate. As can be seen, losses to economic growth for Canada and Mexico are around 1.15 percentage points from the 25% U.S. tariffs, and this increases to over 3 percentage points should they both impose 25% tariffs on U.S. imports.', 'The tariffs will take a toll on employment in all three countries. Figure 2 shows the job losses from tariffs. In the U.S., employment will decline by 0.11% from the 25% tariffs on imports and rise to a 0.25% loss of jobs with retaliation. Based on 2024 job data, this is equivalent to over 177,000 job losses from the 25% tariff, rising to over 400,000 job losses in the event Canada and Mexico retaliate. Job losses in Canada and Mexico would be around 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively, and based on 2024 jobs numbers, this would amount to 278,000 Canadian jobs and 1.4 million Mexican jobs. In the event of retaliation, job loses would increase to almost 2.5% and 3.6% of total employment in Canada and Mexico, equivalent to over 510,000 Canadian jobs and 2.2 million Mexican jobs.', 'Tariffs will also lead to lower wages across the three countries. In the U.S., wages would decline by 0.2%, and by 0.5% in the event of retaliation. In Canada, wages would fall by over 2.6% and in Mexico by over 4.5% in the scenario of no retaliation, and by 4.9% and over 7% in Canada and Mexico following retaliation by both countries. Worth noting here is that the contraction in demand for labor and decline in wages would be distributed evenly across skilled and unskilled labor, but with a slightly higher impact on unskilled labor.', 'The impact from tariffs on exports shown in Figure 3 would also be large. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would decline by around 6% from a 25% U.S. tariff, and 9% in the case of retaliation. Exports from Canada to the U.S. and Mexico would contract by 9% with a U.S. tariff, and by 19% with retaliatory tariffs. Mexico’s exports would contract by close to 14% and over 25% with retaliatory tariffs.', 'As seen in Figure 4, tariffs would also have an impact on inflation. The tariffs would cause inflation to rise in the U.S. by over 1.3 percentage points. With retaliation, the inflation increase in the U.S. would be less at around 0.8 percentage points, but still significant, reflecting the greater slowdown in U.S. economic growth. In the case of Canada, inflation would decline as U.S. tariffs lower economic growth, but should Canada then impose 25% tariffs, inflation would increase, reflecting the impact on the price of imports from the U.S. In the case of Mexico, there is also significant decline in inflation of 9% following U.S. tariffs, reflecting the impact of lower economic growth, and this decline is reduced to around 6 percentage points should Mexico put a 25% tariff on U.S. imports.', 'The results presented earlier show the impact on the aggregate economies. The negative impact on exports is widely dispersed across sectors, the bottom line being that all three countries experience significant sector-wide contractions in exports.', 'The following presents some of the sector-specific trade results. Given that there are no tariffs proposed between Canada and Mexico, and as the vast majority of their exports are to the U.S., the following analysis focuses on the impacts on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico, and the impacts on Canadian and Mexican exports to the U.S. To start, the trinational integration of many of the sectors through supply chains means that many of the sectors affected by these tariffs are common across the three countries. Moreover, many of the sectors affected produce manufacturing and other business inputs, such as metals, computers, and machinery equipment. Raising the costs of these exports will therefore increase costs for businesses in all countries, reducing their competitiveness, and lead many businesses to instead source inputs from other countries, including those in Asia.', 'In the U.S. for example, as shown in Table 1, exports across mining, manufacturing, lumber, and metals would all suffer large contractions in exports. U.S. mining exports to Canada suffer an almost 60% decline in exports, and following retaliation, U.S. mining exports are almost completely wiped out, with a 97% contraction. There is a 25% contraction in U.S. motor vehicle exports to Canada that increases to 55% with retaliation, and products in “other transport” fall by 18% following U.S. tariffs and by 79% with retaliation. In the electrical equipment sector, the 12% decline in exports from the electrical sector will turn into a 30% plus decline with retaliation.', 'Table 2 shows that U.S. exports to Mexico also fall across manufacturing, lumber, foods, and metals in particular, but almost every sector experiences a large contraction in exports. For example, U.S. exports of nonferrous metals such as copper, aluminum, zinc, and gold decline by 35% following the U.S. tariffs and then by 78% with retaliation by Mexico. U.S. exports of manufactured products—computers and electronics, motor vehicles, electronic equipment, other transport—all suffer large declines. For example, there is a 31% decline in exports of computers and electronics, and with retaliation, these U.S. exports fall by over 80%. Exports of motor vehicles also decline by 23% with tariffs and then by 65% following retaliation.', 'Table 3 shows some of the key sectors where Canada’s exports to the U.S. would contract across manufacturing, mining, textiles, rubber, and plastics. For example, exports of electronic equipment and electronics decline by over 70% following U.S. tariffs and by close to 80% with retaliatory tariffs. Exports of “other transport” decline by 70% with tariffs and 74% with retaliation, and motor vehicle exports from Canada decline by 53% with the U.S. tariffs and by 68% with retaliatory tariffs. The top five contraction in Canada’s exports.', 'The decline in exports from Mexico are across mining, the auto sector, electrical equipment, rubber and apparel, and textiles. For instance, Mexico’s mining sector exports suffer contractions of over 90%. The pharmaceutical sector also contracts over 60% with tariffs and over 70% following retaliation. Mexico’s exports of motor vehicle and electronic equipment sectors also contract significantly, a common outcome for all three countries given the supply chains in these sectors, with exports falling 40% and 55%, respectively, and with the retaliation, exports of these products fall by 50% and 62%.', 'The U.S. tariff of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico is going to reduce U.S. economic growth, reduce jobs, cause wages to fall, and prices to rise, and retaliation by Canada and Mexico will multiply the economic harms across the three countries. President Trump has said that these tariffs are in response to flows of fentanyl and illegal immigrants from Mexico and Canada. The problem with these tariffs is that they impose immediate costs on U.S. consumers, workers, and businesses without a clear link between these tariffs and how they will reduce flows of immigrants or fentanyl.', 'Moreover, these tariffs will harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China. ', 'Unless the Trump administration resolves its issues with Canada and Mexico and unwinds these tariffs quickly, the economic, diplomatic, and strategic harms from the tariffs will be substantial.', 'RELATED CONTENT', 'February 28, 2022', 'Robin Brooks', 'January 16, 2025', 'Adam Looney, Elena Patel', 'January 15, 2025', 'AUTHOR', '', 'The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.
