"Move Over, Haute Couture: Lingerie Drove the Style at 2025 Grammys",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/lingerie-2025-grammys-style-1236126006/,"['', '', ""It rained underwear at the music industry's biggest night — and that was even before Charli XCX's climactic number."", 'BY LAURIE BROOKINS', '', 'Anyone who has attended Coachella or Burning Man the last few years knows that lingerie has been driving the style trends among concert performers and attendees alike — same if you’ve attended any night of Sabrina Carpenter‘s Short n’ Sweet tour, which features the now-Grammy winner in a wide array of bodysuits, crystal-beaded corsets, garters and other lingerie-inspired designs.', 'It’s unsurprising, then, to see seemingly every iteration of bras, panties, corsets and more at what could’ve been dubbed “the underwear Grammys” Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena. Consider that during the night’s final number, Charli XCX’s “Brat,” it literally rained underwear from the stage, with Victoria’s Secret and sister brand PINK donating more than 10,000 panties to descend upon the artist and models, including media personality Julia Fox, as they writhed on stage amid a rave-like vibe designed to echo the song’s music video.', '', 'In a corner of the screen, viewers were informed that the unworn panties used as set dressing would be donated to the I Support the Girls foundation, a non-profit organization that collects underwear and menstrual-hygiene products to donate to women and girls in homeless shelters.', 'It was the perfect capper to a night in which lingerie details reigned supreme both on the red carpet and onstage. Willow Smith wore a McQueen tailored coat over a Fleur du Mal bra and panty set that had been custom-embellished with crystal beading, while Fox appeared in a sheer black dress and jacket over matching bra and panties (the woman who succeeded her in Kanye West’s life, Bianca Censori, unfortunately skipped the underwear altogether in a similar look).', 'Meanwhile, the corset, a piece indeed rooted in lingerie and underpinnings, played a starring role in several high-wattage dresses and gowns. From Taylor Swift‘s lipstick-red Vivienne Westwood minidress to Doechii‘s gray pinstripe corset dress and the Jean Paul Gaultier gown worn by Charli XCX on the carpet — a piece fresh from the haute-couture collection designed by Ludovic de Saint Sernin and presented in Paris on Jan. 29 — the corset seemed to be the detail embraced by artists desiring a lingerie look without a blatantly bare aesthetic.', '', 'That cousin to the corset, a waist cincher, also figured prominently in some looks, from Clairo’s polka-dot dress by Miss Claire Sullivan to the wide gold-filigree belt that Alicia Keys wore as part of her Dolce & Gabbana Alto Moda look (not technically a waist cincher, but its shape and width undeniably evoked the idea).', 'Performance looks further drove home the idea that stripping down to little more than a bra and panty is not only the trend — perhaps it’s now expected? Best new artist winner Chappell Roan performed “Pink Pony Club” in a bronze metallic corset look, while best rap album winner Doechii, offering up both “Catfish” and “Denial is a River,” and her backup dancers turned her back-to-back numbers into an impressive Thom Browne advertisement, with the singer/rapper finishing the number in a custom white cotton jockstrap brief and matching demi-cup bra by the designer.', 'Sabrina Carpenter’s performance of “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” started in a mini-tuxedo look by Dolce & Gabbana and segued into blue beaded corset look also by the Itallian label. Charli XCX ultimately wrapped the night in a denim bra and panty with matching belted jacket, vintage pieces from Dior‘s aptly named “Street Chic” collection from spring/summer 2002.', 'More than two decades later, that Dior theme sounds positively prescient. And while lingerie is nothing new for the music industry — for anyone who thinks so, Madonna would like a word — its current influence on concert and artist style is so dominant, underwear literally rains from the sky.', '', 'See all the red carpet looks and THR‘s best dressed list.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"

This year, a whopping 94 awards are being handed out, though not all are televised or announced during the ceremony. They are split into 11 different fields, which include the general field with the Big Six awards (previously the Big Four): Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best New Artist, Producer of the Year (Non-Classical), and Songwriter of the Year (Non-Classical).', 'There is also a long list of performers: Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, Chris Martin, Doechii, Shakira and Stevie Wonder are just some of the stars hitting the stage.', 'Scroll below for some of the cutest couple sightings from the night, plus head here to take a look at some of the best looks from the red carpet, and here for our live updates featuring the best moments of the ceremony.', '1\n/10', 'The country star was supported by her Outer Banks actor boyfriend, plus their good friend, fellow musician Noah Kahan, also joined them.', '2\n/10', ""TikTok's favorite couple looked fabulous together."", '3\n/10', 'The Grateful Dead icon was joined by his wife as well as their daughters, Chloe and Monet Weir.', '4\n/10', 'The Green Day rock star was joined by his wife Adrienne, to whom he has been married for 31 years.', '5\n/10', ""It was mom and dad's night out for Chrissy and John."", '6\n/10', 'The couple made quite the statement.', '7\n/10', 'Heidi and Tom also stepped out.', '8\n/10', 'Olivia, a presenter tonight, was accompanied by her actor boyfriend.', '9\n/10', ""Billie's brother Finneas had his longtime girlfriend as his plus one."", '10\n/10', 'The ""Poker Face"" singer was supported by her fiancé.', '', '']"
Grammys 2025 Red-Carpet: See All the Outfits & Looks,https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/grammys-2025-red-carpet-fashion,"['At the Grammys 2025, music’s biggest stars turned the volume all the way up on their red-carpet fashion. Before the Grammys 2025 ceremony began at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, the Grammy red carpet 2025 reminded audiences that Grammy fashion can be just as eclectic as one’s musical tastes (remember your Spotify Wrapped?). It was here at the Grammys 2025 that the Recording Academy of the United States celebrated achievements in a variety of musical genres. And with pop stars, rappers, and at least one sitar player among the Grammys 2025 nominees, viewers were treated to dazzling Grammys fashion.', ""As the Grammys red carpet got underway, Jaden Smith made an early fashion statement. Smith opted for a slim-cut black Louis Vuitton tux, and a white shirt and black tie by MSFTS and an unexpected accessory in the form of a large castle on his head. The distinctive headgear was created by ABODI and is called the “Vampire Castle.” For Taylor Swift, it appeared that Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs (who head to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas next Sunday, Feb. 9) and their signature shade were top of mind. The singer wore a sparkling scarlet minidress from Vivienne Westwood and red strappy Casadei stilettos that channeled a bit of team spirit in the lead-up to next weekend's big game. Meanwhile, Chappell Roan went deep into the archives for her dramatic Jean Paul Gaultier couture look, which she paired with John Fluevog boots, and was styled by Genesis Webb."", 'One Grammys look that always works? Making history. Last year, Swift made Grammys history with her fourth album-of-the-year win, as she surpassed Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, and Paul Simon, who each won the award three times. “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song,” she said while accepting the award.', ""And this year, Beyoncé, who earned 11 nods for her country concept album, Cowboy Carter, proved she transcends genre. She won best country album, best country duo/group performance for “II MOST WANTED,” her collaboration with Miley Cyrus, and the night's biggest honor: Album of the year, an award only three Black women had previously won."", '“I just feel very full and very honored. It’s been many, many years,” she said after accepting the award for album of the year. “I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, for all of the hard work. I want to dedicate this to Miss [Linda] Martell, and I’ll just hopefully keep pushing forward, opening doors.”', 'No matter who won the awards, the Grammys red carpet is where everyone gets to shine.', 'Below, all the red-carpet fashion, outfits, and looks from the 2025 Grammys.

Just a jaw-droppingly perfect marriage of design and wearer.', '', 'The “II Most Wanted” singer has long been one of the best at working retro ’70s glam, and this leather Saint Laurent is giving us visions of Cher in Bob Mackie, as it was surely intended to do.

It’s got a ’90s minimalism that appeals to us, but we really hate the random strings, as well as that bizarre white panel on the back that’s giving “Kick Me” sign.', 'READ MORE ABOUT BILLIE’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'The “Espresso” singer and Record of the Year nominee is the current reigning queen of cutesy-poo hot good-girl style. She has a knack for working looks that could look like jokes on a different wearer, but the thing is, your girl is always in on the joke. Everything she wears comes with a wink implied and this confection of a gown—which is impressively unwrinkled—is no different. She looks adorably hot, if that makes any sense.', 'READ MORE ABOUT SABRINA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'We feel if there’s any one celebrity who could make a semi-sheer, super-shiny lavender suit work for them it would be Troye Sivan. Turns out? He can’t! Not even a little bit! Looking at this, we’re coming to the conclusion that no one can. The “Got Me Started” singer and Best Dance Pop Recording nominee looks like a rumpled laundry pile and oddly, the pieces he’s sporting don’t match.', '', 'The “Nissan Altima” singer and Best Rap Album nominee looked like she loved her Thom Browne dress, and to be fair, the severe style really suits her, but as much as we love the starkness of the design and the playfulness of the exaggerated hips, that white oxford shirt and prep school tie just isn’t working with the rest of it.', 'READ MORE ABOUT DOECHII’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'We were all set to make a crack about how mad she must have been when she saw Miley Cyrus wearing a similar dress, but the longer we looked at this, the more we realized the “Can’t Catch Me Now” singer and Best Song Written for Visual Media nominee looks so good in this slinky vintage Versace that she doesn’t need to worry about being compared to anyone.

Not that the “Die With a Smile” and Song of the Year nominee could ever be accused of being unoriginal. This gown is intricately detailed, incredibly dramatic, and beautifully styled, from the blunt bangs to the boots to that drop-dead stunning Tiffany necklace. It’s as classic a goth glam look as you’ll find anywhere, but it has a high-fashion chicness to it that only Gaga could make happen.', 'READ MORE ABOUT LADY GAGA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'The Best Country Song nominee for “The Architect” sported a style that should have worked better for her. We like the idea of country artists working hi-lo glam and we think she’s particularly well-suited to it, but we’d have rather seen that gorgeous Ralph Lauren skirt paired with a plain t-shirt than that yoga-looking tank top. The “lo” just isn’t low enough to make the “hi” part sing.', 'READ MORE ABOUT KACEY’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'It’s impossible to look at this outrageously romantic Chanel dress and not read it as bridal, which is a style that always looks jarring in a red carpet setting, but the “Us” singer and Best Pop Duo Performance nominee was so clearly pleased with it that she kind of charmed us into loving it. Not all of it, mind you. Those bows can go.', 'READ MORE ABOUT GRACIE’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'The “Beautiful Things” singer and Best New Artist nominee could not be better suited to the kind of hot swag this somewhat basic Dolce & Gabbana disco suit requires. While we’d have liked seeing it rendered in a more exciting color, there’s something to be said for keeping the look toned-down so it doesn’t veer into tacky. He looks chic.', '', 'The “360” singer and Album of the Year nominee brought a hard-edged romantic glamour to the red carpet with this fluffy piece of dryer lint. No, really. The drab gray color of this gown is what makes it work so well for her. If it had been rendered in pink—or worse, Brat green–it would have looked chintzy. But the muted shade along with the kick-ass boots lend it a touch, no-frills chicness.', 'READ MORE ABOUT CHARLI’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'We’re not entirely sure why, but we really dislike the combination of short, heavily beaded black dress with an oversized white coat. Something about the pairing just looks tacky to our eyes. Or maybe it’s the dress itself that bugs. The beading comes off too stiff and armor-like.', 'READ MORE ABOUT KELSEA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', '', 'Lady, you had us until we got to the socks. The “Broken Man” singer and Best Rock Performance nominee looked classically chic to us at first glance. After all, how can you go wrong with a tuxedo jacket and a pair of transparent tights?

We thought the gloves were a little goofy, and we were willing to go with it, but the knee-highs are an absolute no for us.', '', 'Just pure feral glam with a drop-dead sexiness to it. Marilyn Monroe herself couldn’t have done it any better.

The Grammys Looks Worth Talking About,https://www.papermag.com/grammys-2025-red-carpet,"['The red carpet was rolled out last night in Los Angeles, a city recently spared a worsening fire season by unseasonable high rains. Against the backdrop of the Grammys Fire Relief step-and-repeat, stars walked up and down in everything from haute couture to tank tops. Some wore the latest fashions, some pulled from the archive and all walked gingerly around the massive shadow left by Lady Gaga’s voluminous black dress.', 'Generally, we categorize the looks from these awards shows into categories like ""best"" and ""worst,"" broadly defined, but the new year calls for change. With so many PAPER stars present at the ceremony this year, who were heavily awarded at that, we’ve decided to go in a different direction. Rather than arbitrary definitions, our ongoing awards season coverage will instead focus on the looks worth talking about.', '', '', 'After all, fashion is communication. It is a transfer of ideas between the designer, society, its wearers, the entire world around them and history itself. Bad looks inspire just the same as good ones do, and some of the most technically executed looks spur just about nothing in me at all. As such, each of the following looks was cause for conversation, heated or full of praise. They inspired debate, sparked new ideas, burned themselves to memory and most importantly, gave me a reason to get up at the crack of dawn and right this very blog.', 'Shall we get into the Grammys now?', 'Fashion’s latest it-kid Samuel Lewis has popped up everywhere in the last year, whether it’s on Lady Gaga in her ""Disease"" video, Julia Fox’s wardrobe on OMG Fashun, Chappell Roan’s viral nun outfit or Lady Gaga again, at the Grammys. The Australian-Taiwanese designer has a sick and twisted mind, much like Mother Monster, and their ongoing collaboration for the Mayhem era is proof of her self-professed artistic renaissance.', 'Her imperial phase, which lasted between The Fame Monster and Artpop, was defined by fashion that was deeply grotesque; it was a reign of weirdness that felt exhilarating. Each new look in that time was a rush like no other, and the friction it caused with her surroundings lit sparks the industry still chases today. Nobody has ever come close to replicating it, and they never will — not even Lady Gaga herself. But in Samuel Lewis she has found someone who understands how she got there in the first place. Not in voluminous Valentino tulle and ostrich feathers, Brandon Maxwell pantsuits or paint-by-numbers Armani gowns, as we’ve grown accustomed to. Finally, after a decade defined by relative normalcy, she’s popped up at a major awards show looking freakish. Among the baby bangs and the structured shoulders and asymmetrical bustle skirt and peak of skin between her breasts and deconstructed Kevyn Aucoin beat, there’s simply too much here that excites me.', 'The pop diva trio of 2024 each took home major wins last night, with looks that personified their artistic visions for pop music in this mid-decade. Literally! The genius of each look is in how they perfectly distill the wearer down to their individual essence. Sabrina is the anthropomorphic vintage glamour Instagram account in JW Anderson. Charli XCX is the dance commander of modern Jean Paul Gaultier, Kelly Rowland style, at last reborn. Chappell Roan is the camp harlequin, fittingly dressed in archival Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture.', 'Of the three, Charli’s is perhaps my favorite, only because the leather gladiator boot is silly against her beautifully gray Jean Paul Gaultier corset dress. One can almost imagine her as the ringleader of the circus, sans top hot, that Chappell and Sabrina work at. She struts around the ring while Chappell jumps out a burning clown car and a magician is sawing Sabrina in half. The lack of accessories is also divine, especially in contrast to Chappell, decked to the nines in various accouterments. Of all the details in her look, the western boots are the ones I remembered in the morning, just like that drop pendant along Sabrina’s back. For a look that leaves nothing to the imagination, and nearly reveals her ass crack, it’s the drop pendant that’s sexiest. The way that V cuts her back? Divine! I just hope she escapes that magician’s trick.', ""If there was a theme at the Grammys, it’s gray, and besides Charli, the best examples are JT and Doechii’s contrasting looks. JT wore Grace Ling while Doechii wore Thom Browne. Of the two, I prefer Doechii's, as the body mod breastplate is a bit played out by now. That’s not to say I don’t feel moved by JT’s fit! I love the way the breastplate mimics the folds of fabric across her breast and stomach, although I wish the skirt felt more seamlessly executed. Its flat draping is just a bit too high contrast for what the breastplate wants to achieve. The real winners are the chunky accessories, which have made a big play across fashion’s various outlets of late."", 'As for Doechii, this Thom Browne moment is a big swing — big enough that I felt moved to revisit the collection last night, during which I remembered much of my initial reaction to it. No matter the venue, no matter the time, a white collared shirt can be deeply inelegant. Not that elegance is necessarily the point here, and perhaps that’s why I enjoy it so much. She’s dressed for something only she was invited to, much like she operates in a category all to herself at the moment. (I mean, did you read PAPER’s cover story on her last year?) We should all be thankful she entered that recording booth in the first place, let alone showed up in something worth talking about.', 'The boys were out in fashion last night! While I’m generally averse to both looks on the basis of their tailoring, it’s impressive to see this many big swings from major men in the industry, each in their own lane. Besides, what did I say about gray?', 'Troye’s look is interesting, as a silk organza Prada suit often is. The colors are sensational on him, even if the rise on his inseam and the questionable tailoring on the blazer give him wonky proportions. I also wish the buttons had been similarly covered in organza, or at least not the white buttons used for the shirt. They cheapen the whole thing, which itself should not read cheap. Really, the whole thing hinges on the black shoes, which shows the problems here are primarily in the styling and less in the design. All the pieces are there for something phenomenal. Just look at the way the purple comes through the blazer! It’s so delicate and subtle and makes me sad the rest wasn’t up to snuff.', 'As for Shaboozey, the breakthrough country star wore a custom Diesel ensemble. I’m a fan of the square toe loafers and the glen check on the blazer, which seems to be made out of something thick and slightly reflective. I’m also told the scarf is also custom Diesel, made from this ribboned fabric that’s been tucked into the blazer. I’ve never seen something like it on the carpet, even if it’s been styled a bit too long. In still shots, rather than the live feeds, the effect is lost. Still, I’d love more information on what its unstyled form is — how weird and fascinating!', 'I’ve grouped these two together because, through a twist of fate, they wore similar outfits to the Grammys. Beyond the played out sameness of cutouts and keyholes, I’m more interested in the thematic resonance between the two: both Disney stars, both making big swings at rock music at different points in their careers, both currently attempting to revitalize and change their public image.', 'It feels cheap to say this is Olivia’s most sexed-up look to date, but it’s a notable departure from the more girlish rock chick image she’s so carefully curated the last few years. Gone are the bows and purples and sequins and platform boots. Here she is, snatched beyond belief in Versace, makeup smoked out, hair down to her ass, talons on and most importantly, tits out. Miley, as she often does these days, showed off her bangs and abs in a coincidentally matching Saint Laurent gown. I prefer Olivia’s Versace, if only for the slight train, but it’s still interesting to think about how these dresses are emblematic of their parallel careers. Olivia is carefully tailored and precise, while Miley is more roughed up and weird, which requires the same amount of effort and thought, for the record.', 'The real star of the menswear circuit was J Balvin, who wore a voluminous Dior coat and suit. It’s hard to underscore just how much I love everything about this. From the slope on the shoulders to the material, to the boots, to the sheen of the fabric underneath, teased in small peaks to photographers. It’s totally sensational, while also being a triumphant showcase of the possibility of menswear to move beyond “deconstructed” suits or cheap “gender bending” suit dresses. Play with form! Experiment with overcoats and capes! Showcase interesting materials!', 'Photos via Getty Images', 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information', '', '', '']"

This year's Grammy nominees treat personal style like an extension of their performances, taking every red carpet as a chance to promote their albums through specific colors and motifs. See: Taylor Swift putting in overtime at The Tortured Poets Department in black-and-white Schiaparelli and Vivienne Westwood, or Beyoncé saddling up for Cowboy Carter in an array of Western-inspired suits and cowboy hats. Then there's certified brat Charli XCX, who turned her album's namesake green into a bona fide trend."", ""Naturally, the best 2025 Grammys red carpet looks stayed true to their artists' narratives. Chappell Roan tapped the Jean Paul Gaultier archives in a dramatic, colorful dress befitting her drag persona. Sabrina Carpenter adhered to her vintage pin-up doll aesthetic in a dreamy blue gown with feather trim by JW Anderson. Gracie Abrams's custom Chanel red carpet gown turned the step-and-repeat into her personal aisle. And all around, the best Grammys 2025 red carpet looks rivaled their owners' top tour outfits. Ahead, see all the Outfit of the Year-worthy fashion that hit the Grammys red carpet."", '', 'Beyoncé took home the Best Country Album award in a gold dress referencing Cowboy Carter.', 'At the intersection of Americana aesthetics and a golden trophy lies the gown Beyoncé and stylist Shiona Turini chose for the 2025 Grammy Awards. The ""Texas Hold \'Em"" singer skipped the red carpet, instead turning up inside the ceremony to accept her Best Country Album award—and later, Album of the Year award—in a glittering gold dress by Schiaparelli. The paisley print along the skirt and sleeves, much like her white outfit for a recent NFL halftime show, injected the Western themes of Cowboy Carter with fresh perspective. This wasn\'t a dress you wear to your first rodeo—but it is one for making Grammys history.', '', 'Charli XCX modified her 2025 Grammys red carpet gown from a recent Paris Couture Week collection.', 'Charli XCX opens her (already) Grammy-winning album brat reminding listeners that she\'s their favorite reference. Which makes one wonder, who is hers? The answer for tonight\'s red carpet was Jean Paul Gaultier, whose guest-designed collaboration with Ludovic de Saint Sernin provided her flowing, pale teal gown. It only debuted on the Paris Haute Couture runway last week, but stylist Chris Horan managed to secure the dress bag for his star client in days—and change the color from runway bridal white to the custom tone seen here. Lest anyone doubt that she could bump ""club classics"" in a ballgown, her sturdy lace-up boots and general attitude say she can dance to her own music wearing whatever she wants.', '', 'Taylor Swift collaborated with longtime stylist Joseph Cassell Falconer on a bright-red mini dress by Vivienne Westwood.', 'Corsets and micro-mini skirts have been fixtures in Taylor Swift\'s Tortured Poets Department era. Yet those two elements combined into something entirely new for the Grammy nominee on the 2025 red carpet. She left behind the moody palette of her ""Down Bad"" album for a ruby-red, crystal-covered Vivienne Westwood mini dress. Between the shimmering ""T"" charm on her leg—a reference to another TTPD track—and the miles of Lorraine Schwartz jewels, Swift looked the most vibrant she ever has on the red carpet. Even if she doesn\'t take home a win for her confessional album, she and stylist Joseph Cassell Falconer can end the night knowing they earned their best-dressed accolade.', '', 'Cardi B glistened in a custom Roberto Cavalli dress with a mile-long feather train.', ""Cardi B's first red carpet of 2025 said she came to conquer. The rapper and stylist Kollin Carter teamed up to customize a Roberto Cavalli Spring 2025 gown, adding heaps more feathers to the skirt and adjusting the neckline from a one-shoulder to a plunging off-the-shoulder silhouette. Between the tiger-stripe sequins and figure-skimming shape, I can only think of one word for this look: fierce."", '', 'Chappell Roan arrived at the 2025 Grammys in archival Jean Paul Gaultier.', ""Vintage and archival fashion is becoming commonplace on the red carpet, but Chappell Roan's first select for the 2025 Grammy Awards still made me gasp for the history alone. (First being the operative word—she quick-changed into an all-denim look later in the evening.) This look comes from the designer's 2003 Spring Couture collection, complete with the feathered headpiece that debuted right alongside the Degas ballerina-printed skirt. It's stitched with all the theatricality fans expect from Chappell—and it's so rare, stylist Genesis Webb said she slept next to it in her hotel room for fear of losing it. I too would want eyes on this vintage prize at all times if it was in my arsenal."", 'Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.', '', 'Sabrina Carpenter looked like a vintage movie star in her custom JW Anderson gown.', ""I'd suspected Sabrina Carpenter and stylist Jared Ellner would dream up something vintage-inspired and pin-up worthy for the 2025 Grammys. But I didn't dare expect something as fit for a modern-day Cinderella as the custom JW Anderson gown she ended up wearing. The feather trimmings and backless silhouette (set with a massive Chopard diamond, natch) are right on-par with the custom Victoria's Secret lingerie and Patou lace bodysuits she wore on the Short 'n Sweet tour—and they're also a nod to a bit of fashion history. The piece is a dead-ringer for Shirley MacLaine's baby-blue gown in the 1964 classic What a Way to Go. She wins the reference game, down to the piled-up blonde curls and extra Chopard jewels."", '', 'Gracie Abrams glowed in a custom, butter yellow Chanel gown.', '""Smiling through it all, that\'s my life,"" must have been the lyric running through Gracie Abrams\'s head when she slid into her custom Chanel Grammys red carpet gown. Who could feel anything but happy in a butter yellow bridal moment, complete with a matching chiffon hood and a camellia-embellished belt? While Abrams\'s Chanel ambassador contract usually has her dressing in tweeds and collarless jackets, this look let the star put her own style at the fore. That trending color for her dress? It\'s also the shade of her album title on its cover artwork.', '', 'Doechii arrived at the 2025 Grammys in a corseted Thom Browne dress.', 'Introducing the 2025 Grammys resident ""Swamp Princess""—and Best Rap Album winner. Doechii\'s style is defined by avant-prep dresses and office siren pinstripes, a look she brought all the way to her first Grammys red carpet as a major contender. She and stylist Sam Woolf played on the themes of her viral concerts with an exaggerated corset and matching tie, plus those signature Thom Browne stripes. As her early wins in the night already proved, she\'s at the top of every class.', '', 'Billie Eilish stayed true to her laid-back style in a Prada set.', 'One thing red carpet viewers can trust from Billie Eilish: She\'s not going to follow the reigning red carpet trends. While a nautical little Prada hat felt very appropriate for the headgear-heavy collections coming out of Paris and Milan last season, her relaxed jacket and slacks felt removed from the style cycle. It was down-to-earth and understated, much like Eilish\'s vocals on her Grammy-nominated album. She and Miuccia are truly ""Birds of a Feather.""', '', 'Olivia Rodrigo stepped out of her Guts comfort zone in a cut-out Versace gown.', 'Olivia Rodrigo isn\'t shy about spilling her guts in her lyrics. At the 2025 Grammys, she applied the same bare-it-all ethos to her red carpet gown. She went to the same archive she wore for the 2024 Grammys red carpet—Versace\'s—and this time chose a black dress with dramatic cut-outs. The gown begins with a plunging keyhole neckline, then extends into slices at her hips and an entirely open back. While the punk-rock color palette is right on-brand for Rodrigo, the look didn\'t go entirely into ""déjà vu"" territory. Tiffany & Co. diamonds and loose, Old Hollywood waves helped the singer channel a more mature side of her style.

It all proved that she is one of the most incredible new talents to watch, with style to match.', '', 'She’s come a long way since the meat dress.

While Jaden Smith also opted for a classic black suit and tie on the red carpet, it was the building around his head that stood out.', ""“Oh, I'm shocked,” one person wrote about his look on X. “Why is he wearing that. That’s definitely something.”"", '“Bro pulled up as a house,” another person quipped.', 'Jacob Collier', 'Grammy nominee Jacob Collier stepped onto the red carpet in a bold, multi-colored suit paired with matching pants, a navy blue shirt, and classic black shoes. While never dull, Collier’s sequined look was little more than eye-catching.', 'Bianca Censori', 'Bianca Censori made a surprise appearance on the red carpet with her partner, Kanye West. As she took her black fur coat off, she revealed her naked look.', 'She wore a beige, sheer mini-dress that showcased her nipples. Censori also had her hair in a slick-back bun and opted for a pair of clear kitten heels.', 'Kacy Musgraves', 'Kacey Musgraves went for a classy but also laid-back look, including a white tank top and a gold, sparkled skirt.', 'However, the skirt and shirt didn’t exactly compliment each other well, especially for a red carpet event.', 'Billie Eilish', 'Billie Eilish, who often opts for baggy clothing, embraced her casual style on the red carpet. She wore an oversized black jacket over her white button-down, paired with black pants, sunglasses, and a hat. However, fans were not very impressed by her outfit.', '“Just let out the deepest sigh of disappointment,” one person wrote on X/Twitter about her look.', 'Teddy Swims', 'Teddy Swims wore a tan suit and hat, adorned with white, gold, and black pearls. While the yellow sunglasses were a chic addition to the look, the pearl-covered blazer was slightly reminiscent of some particularly garish curtains at your grandmother’s house.', 'Chrissy Teigen', 'Chrissy Teigen opted for a black, strapless sheer gown, with a matching semi-sheer train. However, fans weren’t pleased by the style of her outfit.', '“What happened to fashion??????” one person wrote about the look on X.', 'Lady Gaga', 'The singer arrived in a black, turtleneck dress, with a voluminous skirt.

Officially the biggest night in music! And this year, your favorite musical stars hit the red carpet in looks ranging from chic to eye-popping. In other words, they wore exactly the kind of looks we’ve come to expect any time musical performers gather to give each other trophies. But if there was one overriding theme for the night, it was a surprising infusion of high, old-school glamour and an unexpected sense of elegance and chicness.', 'Trust the “Good Luck, Babe!” and Best New Artist nominee to take ballet core to drag levels. The dress, from Gaultier’s 2003 Couture collection and adorned with Degas’ classic ballerinas, gives exactly the kind of high-drama romanticism that suits her best, but it’s the flawless beat that really makes the look entirely her own. It’s drag, it’s art, it’s purely Chappell Roan.', 'READ MORE ABOUT CHAPPELL’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The “Fortnight” singer and Album of the Year nominee sauntered confidently onto the red carpet delivering straight-up, old-school, uncomplicated glamour and legs for days. There’s nothing about this dress that we haven’t seen a million times before, but that’s not stopping her from looking like a million bucks in it. We wouldn’t normally support the idea of matching the dress to the lips to the accessories, but we can’t blame a girl for sporting her man’s team color as he heads to the Super Bowl.', 'READ MORE ABOUT TAYLOR’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'We love these two for always reminding us that the red carpet is as much or more of a branding exercise as it is a fashion one. In other words, attention is the name of the game and these two are masters of it. Why is he wearing Wednesday Addams’ dollhouse on his head? Why is she wearing a bathing suit with an overcoat like she ran out of a hotel room on fire? Well, you’re looking at them, aren’t you? That’s why.', 'READ MORE ABOUT JADEN’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The Best Musical Theater Album nominee stunned in this extravagantly chic, borderline over-the-top design that speaks of royal raiment as much as it does red carpet glamour. The simple design of the dress allows the highly detailed corset and headpiece to really shine, and she has the kind of bearing to not let any of it overwhelm her. Just a jaw-droppingly perfect marriage of design and wearer.', 'The “II Most Wanted” singer has long been one of the best at working retro ’70s glam, and this leather Saint Laurent is giving us visions of Cher in Bob Mackie, as it was surely intended to do. It’s not a fresh look, but it’s breezily uncomplicated and we like how low-key the styling is.', 'READ MORE ABOUT MILEY’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The “Birds of a Feather” singer and Record of the Year nominee took her singular style in a crisp new direction while remaining true to herself and her preferences. It’s got a ’90s minimalism that appeals to us, but we really hate the random strings, as well as that bizarre white panel on the back that’s giving “Kick Me” sign.', 'READ MORE ABOUT BILLIE’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The “Espresso” singer and Record of the Year nominee is the current reigning queen of cutesy-poo sexy good-girl style. She has a knack for working looks that could look like jokes on a different wearer, but the thing is, your girl is always in on the joke. Everything she wears comes with a wink implied and this confection of a gown—which is impressively unwrinkled—is no different. She looks adorably hot, if that makes any sense.', 'READ MORE ABOUT SABRINA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'We feel if there’s any one celebrity who could make a semi-sheer, super-shiny lavender suit work for them it would be Troye Sivan. Turns out? He can’t! Not even a little bit! Looking at this, we’re coming to the conclusion that no one can. The “Got Me Started” singer and Best Dance Pop Recording nominee looks like a rumpled laundry pile and oddly, the pieces he’s sporting don’t match.', 'The “Nissan Altima” singer and Best Rap Album nominee looked like she loved her Thom Browne dress, and to be fair, the severe style really suits her, but as much as we love the starkness of the design and the playfulness of the exaggerated hips, that white oxford shirt and prep school tie just isn’t working with the rest of it.', 'READ MORE ABOUT DOECHII’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'We were all set to make a crack about how mad she must have been when she saw Miley Cyrus wearing a similar dress, but the longer we looked at this, the more we realized the “Can’t Catch Me Now” singer and Best Song Written for Visual Media nominee looks so good in this slinky vintage Versace that she doesn’t need to worry about being compared to anyone. We like how simple the style is and how much of a high impact it delivers.', 'READ MORE ABOUT OLIVIA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'Mother Monster has arrived and she’s wearing Elphaba’s dress. Not that the “Die With a Smile” and Song of the Year nominee could ever be accused of being unoriginal. This gown is intricately detailed, incredibly dramatic, and beautifully styled, from the blunt bangs to the boots to that drop-dead stunning Tiffany necklace. It’s as classic a goth glam look as you’ll find anywhere, but it has a high-fashion chicness to it that only Gaga could make happen.', 'READ MORE ABOUT LADY GAGA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The Best Country Song nominee for “The Architect” sported a style that should have worked better for her. We like the idea of country artists working hi-lo glam and we think she’s particularly well-suited to it, but we’d have rather seen that gorgeous Ralph Lauren skirt paired with a plain t-shirt than that yoga-looking tank top. The “lo” just isn’t low enough to make the “hi” part sing.', 'READ MORE ABOUT KACEY’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'It’s impossible to look at this outrageously romantic Chanel dress and not read it as bridal, which is a style that always looks jarring in a red carpet setting, but the “Us” singer and Best Pop Duo Performance nominee was so clearly pleased with it that she kind of charmed us into loving it. Not all of it, mind you. Those bows can go.', 'READ MORE ABOUT GRACIE’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The “Beautiful Things” singer and Best New Artist nominee could not be better suited to the kind of sexy swag this somewhat basic Dolce & Gabbana disco suit requires. While we’d have liked seeing it rendered in a more exciting color, there’s something to be said for keeping the look toned-down so it doesn’t veer into tacky. He looks chic.', 'The “360” singer and Album of the Year nominee brought a hard-edged romantic glamour to the red carpet with this fluffy piece of dryer lint. No, really. The drab gray color of this gown is what makes it work so well for her. If it had been rendered in pink—or worse, Brat green–it would have looked chintzy. But the muted shade along with the kick-ass boots lend it a touch, no-frills chicness.', 'READ MORE ABOUT CHARLI’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'We’re not entirely sure why, but we really dislike the combination of short, heavily beaded black dress with an oversized white coat. Something about the pairing just looks tacky to our eyes. Or maybe it’s the dress itself that bugs. The beading comes off too stiff and armor-like.', 'READ MORE ABOUT KELSEA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'Lady, you had us until we got to the socks. The “Broken Man” singer and Best Rock Performance nominee looked classically chic to us at first glance. After all, how can you go wrong with a tuxedo jacket and a pair of sheer tights? We’ll tell you how: by adding white socks to the equation. We thought the gloves were a little goofy, and we were willing to go with it, but the knee-highs are an absolute no for us.', 'Just pure feral glam with a drop-dead sexiness to it. Marilyn Monroe herself couldn’t have done it any better. The “Enough” singer and Best Rap Performance nominee has a long history of serving up jaw-dropping high glamour on any red carpet, but this look may be her best one ever. The makeup is flawless, the manicure is giving feline, and the feathers are an unexpected bit of fun.', 'READ MORE ABOUT CARDI B’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'The Wicked star and Best Actress Oscar nominee ditched the Elphaba-themed looks she’s been sporting most of the year and instead went for more of a sleek, space queen sort of vibe. We’re not entirely convinced the metallic panel works with that plunging neckline, but the drama of the design is appealing and it really suits her. The jewelry is really well-chosen and the relative minimalism of the design lets her manicure really shine.', 'READ MORE ABOUT CYNTHIA’S GRAMMYS LOOK HERE', 'See the Gucci Dress Tay Wore Out After the Grammys', 'No, Kacey Did Not ""Scowl"" at Bey\'s Grammys Win', ""Attn: ‘Short n' Sweet’ Deluxe Is Coming"", 'Finneas Responds to Billie Eilish’s Grammys Snub', ""This $11 Dupe of Taylor's Thigh Chain Is So Good"", 'Blue Ivy Carter Looks Incredible at 2025 Grammys', 'Why Sabrina’s Grammys Speech Got Censored', ""Let's Talk About Beyoncé's 35 Grammy Wins"", 'Here’s Who Taylor Sat With at the 2025 Grammys', 'Babyface Gets an Apology for Grammys Carpet Snub', ""New Sources Weigh in on Kanye's Grammys Situation"", 'The 5 Best Grammys Performances of 2025, Ranked', 'A Part of Hearst Digital Media', 'We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.', '©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

The Naked Truth About Bianca Censori’s Grammys Look,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-naked-truth-about-bianca-censoris-grammys-look-2025,"['Where do we start with Bianca Censori, the Australian model, “head of architecture” at Yeezy, wife of Kanye West, and near-naked woman on the Grammys red carpet? On Sunday, Bianca stepped out in a black fur coat—so far, so fashion—which she soon dropped to reveal a slip so sheer, so without undergarments, that it exposed her uncensored nudity beneath. Kanye, on the other hand, wore a black T-shirt and trousers.', 'Days later, the questions we’re all asking in the wake of the look circle around Bianca’s sense of autonomy, her sense of liberation, her feminism, our feminism, and her level of complicity in the way she’s showing up on the world stage.', 'Though she’s apparently brimming with body confidence—see Bianca in a nude bodysuit, clutching a hotel pillow over her chest in Florence; see Bianca wearing a transparent Blade Runner-ish raincoat with nothing underneath—her relationship with Ye, both romantic and image-architectural, has been criticized online as perhaps overly-influential, potentially verging on controlling. There are concerns about this particular woman’s silence: We’ve heard very little from Bianca during her Kanye tenure, a remarkably different situation from his relationships with the endlessly quotable uncut gem Julia Fox and his reality powerhouse ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.', 'Most of the women at the Grammys—in a year that felt overwhelmingly celebratory of female excellence—were there for their talent, for their loud-and-clear achievements over the past year. That said, the entire red-carpet mechanism sits on the surface level: We observe the looks—a carousel of perfect snapshots—and make our assessment about whether the dresses work. (Differences of opinion are part of the fun.) Deep-rooted, deeply old-fashioned standards for how women should act in order to appear “decent,” and in turn desirable (to men, to other women), have cast a long shadow on this practice. We’re all drawing our own lines in the sand as to what constitutes too much for a woman to show: what’s cheap, what’s tarty, what’s slutty.', 'At its best, fashion, for me, has always celebrated a body’s sensuality rather than the unimaginative, base-level provocation of a woman’s nakedness. But I have this sinking feeling that Bianca’s dress wasn’t meant to continue a fashion dialogue with other women—that it was purely meant to provoke.', 'Though I’m not convinced our judgements on the opaquer, less-naked dresses on red carpets reflect our best selves, they do consider our understanding of the woman in the dress, or at least her media image. It just feels icky to know so little about Bianca. While she appears to have a sense of humour (I found the hotel pillows quite funny), all I really know about her is that she has a penchant for revealing garments.', 'While I’m not necessarily advocating for snatch on the red carpet, it could also be argued that it’s Bianca’s body, and therefore Bianca’s choice. I hate to state the obvious, but a woman can wear whatever she wants. A woman can wear as many sheer bodysuits and thongs as she likes. A woman can court the male gaze. A woman can make a zillion choices we wouldn’t personally make ourselves and still not have that mean she’s being coerced, that she’s a victim of an overbearing force, that something predatory has happened. I don’t think we should assume that because Bianca’s pretty much naked, she’s not fully in control of herself, or that she’s not thoroughly enjoying her exhibitionism. We can’t jump to a conclusion just because seeing her virtually in the nude doesn’t feel good. Because Bianca isn’t speaking up, because we’re bereft of any deeper motivations (or personality), the silence has us scrabbling for answers of our own. But maybe that’s exactly what Bianca wanted.', 'See Every Look from the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet', 'See the Full List of 2025 Grammy Award Winners', 'The Best Dressed Stars at the 2025 Grammys', 'Taylor!
