Last year, advertisers removed their ads from X en masse as a result of legitimate brand safety concerns, after several big brands found their ads running alongside offensive and harmful content. The lawsuit alleges that brands pausing/discontinuing ad spend on X was a coordinated boycott and hurt its competitiveness in digital advertising. Nestlé, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell have now been added to the lawsuit. ', 'UK TV audience measurement organisation Barb has released its latest Establishment Survey which reveals that 68.3% of UK homes – equivalent to 20 million – had access to a subscription video-on-demand service in the final quarter of 2024. The figure is a slight dip from Q2. According to Barb’s advertising tier estimates, these continue gaining popularity within the UK: Netflix ad tier reached 4.7 million homes, up more than a fifth from the Q3. Similarly, Disney’s ad tier reached 1.5 million, up more than a quarter from the previous quarter. Due to Amazon’s ad tier tactic, 11.6 million homes with Amazon Prime Video access during the quarter were on the ad tier, an increase from 11.5 million in Q3. ', 'In the EU, new laws are underway which would make e-commerce platforms liable for dangerous or illegal products sold to consumers. According to an EU draft proposal seen by the FT, customs reforms would oblige online platforms to provide data before goods arrive in the region, to give officials more control over packages and their inspection. Under the current law, individuals within the EU who purchase goods online are treated as their importer for customs purposes – the new legislation would make platforms responsible instead. The move is a crackdown on imported goods, amid concerns over the rising number of dangerous and counterfeit goods shipped from Asia to European consumers.', 'AdvertiserCTVLawsuitStreamingTVTwitter / XX Corp', 'X Ad Revenue Down 24%; Judge Blocks Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery Planned Bundle on Antitrust Grounds ', 'Origin Beta Trials Commence; Barb Expands Campaign Planning Tool; Pluto TV Partners with French AVOD Platform M6+ ', 'Nexxen’s Steven Broadhead on the Power of ACR Data', 'Get the latest ExchangeWire news delivered straight to your inbox.']"

That lawsuit is ongoing, and it has now been broadened to add more brands, including Lego, Nestlé, and Pinterest.', 'In November 2023, IBM suspended its advertising on X after a report said one of its ads appeared next to posts that promoted Hitler and the Nazi party. More companies later suspended their advertising on the platform, including Disney. It led to X filing a lawsuit in Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and its Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) initiative, in which the WFA and member companies are accused of violating antitrust laws.', 'On Saturday, X added Lego, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive, Pinterest, and Shell International as defendants in the suit.', ""The lawsuit alleges that the defendants conspired to collectively withhold billions in advertising revenue following Musk's takeover of Twitter in 2022. It named CVS, Mars, Ørsted, and Twitch, which was added later, specifically. Unilever had also been named but was dropped after the two companies reached an agreement."", 'According to the complaint, the WFA organized an advertiser boycott of Twitter/X through GARM with the goal of ""coercing the platform to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards to the satisfaction of GARM.""', 'We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words.\n\nNow, it is war. https://t.co/MEzH0vqz0p', 'GARM was launched in 2019 to help the industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising.', 'GARM members agree ""to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM\'s brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards,"" the lawsuit states. It alleges that members discontinued or sharply curtailed their ad spending on X after Musk took over.', 'The WFA discontinued GARM shortly after the lawsuit was filed. The organization wrote that ""recent allegations that unfortunately misconstrue its purpose and activities have caused a distraction and significantly drained its resources and finances.""', 'The suit also claims that member companies celebrated when X did not meet its forecasted revenue goals, and that the boycott continues today despite X meeting or exceeding standards set by GARM. It\'s claimed that ad prices on X remain well below those charged by its closest social media competitors, so ""by refraining from purchasing advertising from X, boycotting advertisers are forgoing a valuable opportunity to purchase low-priced advertising inventory on a platform with brand safety that meets or exceeds industry standards.""', 'Musk responded to the advertisers\' exodus by telling the brands to ""Go f**k yourself"" during an interview at The New York Times Dealbook Summit. He later claimed this was about freedom of speech.', 'Watch my conversation with @ElonMusk: https://t.co/YedkELVhFn', 'X has recently seen several brands increase their advertising spending or return to the site, likely a result of Musk\'s close ties with the Trump administration.

The company argues that advertisers didn’t just leave individually but worked together to pressure X into following external content moderation policies.', 'Not long after the lawsuit was filed, WFA shut down GARM, calling it a ‘distraction.’ Whether that was a strategic retreat or an attempt to move on quietly remains unclear.', 'The newly named brands haven’t responded to the lawsuit yet, but the case could redefine the balance of power between social media platforms and advertisers.

The X CEO and leader of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made a splash last weekend after DOGE representatives were given access to the Treasury Department payment system. But there is another interesting—if less sensational—story involving Musk from this past weekend, and it's notable for the way it illustrates the facade of Musk's professed support for free speech and free markets."", 'On Saturday, Musk added seven new targets to a lawsuit accusing advertisers of violating U.S. antitrust law by choosing not to advertise on X.', 'Musk first filed this suit last August against the World Federation of Advertisers and the companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health, and Orsted. In an amended complaint filed Saturday, he added Nestle, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell.', 'Basically, Musk thinks it should be illegal for these companies to have simultaneously pulled advertising dollars from his company.', 'Musk\'s suit alleges that these companies colluded in a way that violates U.S. antitrust law. The companies were all part of the World Federation of Advertisers and were ""concerned that X, formerly known as Twitter, would stray from [the federation\'s] brand safety initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media,"" reports NPR.', 'In response, the defendant companies and others either stopped or reduced their advertising spending on the platform. And as a result, X lost a lot of money, according to the suit.', 'This, in turn, made X ""a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform,"" it states. In this way, the boycott allegedly violated laws against anticompetitive actions.', 'But in this case, X became less ""competitive"" because of its own actions and the actions of its founder. You can judge for yourself whether opposing Musk\'s new policies on Twitter/X was prudent or justified. But it is silly to suggest that companies shouldn\'t be allowed to oppose them just because it would make X less competitive.', ""Antitrust law cannot require private companies to continue associating with a company they don't wish to simply because ceasing business with that company will make it less competitive. That would be completely contrary to the ideas of free markets and open competition, and also completely contrary to the idea of free speech."", 'Musk tries to dress up his complaint in the language of choice and freedom, arguing that social media entities must be allowed to set their own moderation policies and that ""collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards"" is bad for consumers.', 'And corporate entities have certainly been known to encourage atmospheres where speech—be that speech from employees, their own corporate speech, or the speech of platforms where they advertise—is overly ""safe."" (I once worked for a women\'s health website where we were forbidden from using the terms ""vagina"" or ""rape"" in headlines because advertisers didn\'t like it.)', ""But that is their prerogative. Private entities are perfectly free to encourage those they do business with to adopt certain values, and they're perfectly free to use private market mechanisms—such as boycotts—as part of this encouragement. Boycotts are a part of free markets and of free expression."", 'The alternative that Musk is demanding would be worse than a world of woke corporations and overly cautious advertisers. In this world, private market actors would be compelled to continue doing business with entities they wish not to and to broadcast their speech in venues they do not wish to. (Conservatives cheering on Musk should imagine how this would work out in other contexts. Do you want companies with conservative values to be forbidden from pulling ads from platforms that decided to promote porn, Kamala Harris, and DEI?)', 'To add credence to his antitrust claims, Musk suggests that pulling advertising was ""against the unilateral self-interest of the advertisers"" and ""made economic sense only in furtherance of a conspiracy performed in the confidence that competing advertisers were doing the same."" This falls apart upon examination. At the time Musk took over, many left-of-center people were upset about it and worried about the policies he would put in place. And many companies were (and are) concerned with appearing insufficiently attune to progressive speech standards and/or ""harm"" on social media more generally. Whether or not you agree with that, it\'s not unreasonable for such companies to worry about reputational harm that could harm their bottom line. It\'s also not unreasonable for them to have feared that an exodus of users would diminish the value of advertising on the platform, and to have temporarily pulled back spending to see how things shook out. In short, there are several legitimate business reasons why companies may have suspended advertising at that time.', ""The fact that these companies acted in tandem, not alone, is at the core of Musk's complaint. But it shouldn't make a bit of difference. Acting in tandem is how boycotts work. And boycotts—by individuals or corporations—are a form of protected speech."", ""Musk likes to style himself as a defender of free speech and free markets, but he's shown time and again that this principle falls to the wayside when it conflicts with his self-interest. This lawsuit serves as a perfect example."", '• A California cop has been found guilty of ""deprivation of constitutional rights under color of law"" for abducting and sexually assaulting four women.', '• Some meditations on where the ""tech right"" came from.', ""• Shifting age verification mandates from online platforms to app stores doesn't solve the problems with age verification, write Josh Withrow and Shoshana Weissman of the R Street Institute:"", ""State and federal legislation mandating that sites verify users' age and adjust their social media experiences accordingly are still popular, despite the fact that they have repeatedly failed court challenges.

According to USA Today, the new complaint, filed by Elon Musk’s legal team on Saturday, targets a range of companies that are members of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), an influential advertising industry group.', 'The lawsuit, initially filed in 2024, alleges that GARM and its members, including companies like CVS, Mars, Ørsted, and Twitch, unlawfully conspired to withhold billions in advertising revenue from the platform after Musk’s acquisition in 2022. Now, the amended complaint adds additional names to the list, including global brands such as Nestlé, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell International.', 'The legal action claims that GARM and its members collectively pressured X to comply with the group’s preferred brand safety standards, leading to a coordinated advertising boycott. This, the lawsuit argues, has had a lasting impact on the platform’s revenue and operations. Musk’s legal team contends that this concerted effort to enforce specific standards among advertisers undermines the competitive dynamics of the market and harms consumers.', 'Related: Advertising Group Suspends Brand Safety Unit Amid Lawsuit from Elon Musk’s X', 'Further detailing the scope of the alleged conspiracy, the complaint accuses the companies of celebrating when X failed to meet its projected revenue targets, highlighting the ongoing effects of the boycott despite X’s efforts to implement brand safety measures that meet or exceed GARM’s standards.', 'Nestlé, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmolive, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell International have yet to respond to requests for comment from USA Today regarding the expanded lawsuit.', 'Musk’s legal team argues that social media platforms should be free to establish their own brand safety standards based on what is most suitable for their users and competitive environment. They assert that forcing platforms to adhere to the collective preferences of powerful advertisers compromises the competitive process and prioritizes the interests of these advertisers over those of consumers.', '“This kind of collective action among competitors to set the standards for social media platforms skips over the competitive process,” the complaint states, further accusing the advertisers of using their market power to push their own agenda.', 'Source: USA Today', '', 'Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has quickly risen to prominence with its DeepSeek-R1 model, becoming one of the most downloaded AI applications worldwide. However, its rapid ascent has been met with growing security concerns, prompting multiple governments to ban or investigate the platform, according to Reuters.', 'As per Reuters, concerns surrounding DeepSeek-R1 include its potential to generate harmful or biased content, as well as broader cybersecurity risks. The fact that DeepSeek is a Chinese company has added another layer of scrutiny, as China’s national security laws allow authorities to access data from companies operating within its jurisdiction. This has fueled fears that DeepSeek could be used as a tool for data collection, particularly by foreign governments.', 'The Australian government has implemented a sweeping ban on DeepSeek across all government devices. On Tuesday, the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs issued a directive requiring all government entities to remove any existing DeepSeek applications and web services from their systems. Per Reuters, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke labeled the AI startup an “unacceptable risk” to national security, prompting immediate action to protect government infrastructure. The ban does not extend to private citizens’ devices.', 'Taiwan has also moved swiftly to ban the use of DeepSeek’s AI model across government agencies and critical infrastructure. The Ministry of Digital Affairs cited concerns over national information security, stating that DeepSeek’s operations involve cross-border data transmission, which could lead to data leakage. As Reuters reports, Taiwan’s concerns are heightened due to Beijing’s territorial claims over the island and previous apprehensions about Chinese tech companies.', 'While the United States has not imposed a nationwide ban, Texas became the first state to prohibit DeepSeek on government-issued devices. Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the move on January 31, stating that the state would not allow the “Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.” According to Reuters, Texas’ ban also extends to other Chinese-owned platforms, including Xiaohongshu (RedNote) and Lemon8.', 'Related: Italy Blocks Chinese AI Model DeepSeek Over Data Privacy Concerns', 'Italy', 'Italy was the first country to take action against DeepSeek, ordering a block on January 30. The Italian data protection authority instructed DeepSeek’s parent companies, Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence and Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, to halt data processing activities involving Italian users. Per Reuters, Italian regulators took issue with DeepSeek’s refusal to comply with requests for information and are currently investigating the company’s operations within the country.', 'In addition to outright bans, several countries have begun probing DeepSeek’s data management practices. Authorities in Belgium, Ireland, France, and South Korea have initiated inquiries into how the AI company handles user information, according to Reuters. These investigations could potentially lead to further restrictions or regulatory actions against the platform.', 'The rise of DeepSeek has been met with significant pushback from global regulators, particularly in countries wary of Chinese technology’s implications on national security. With bans already in place and investigations underway, the future of DeepSeek’s AI model remains uncertain in several key markets.', 'Source: Reuters', 'DeepSeek Faces Global Scrutiny as Governments Ban AI Model Over Security Concerns\nFeb 4, 2025 by CPI', 'Vodafone CEO Praises UK Competition Authority for Modern Approach to Mergers\nFeb 4, 2025 by CPI', 'Apple Raises Concerns Over Pornography App on EU-Based AltStore PAL\nFeb 4, 2025 by CPI', 'Top AI and Tech Advisor Joins Paul Hastings as Partner\nFeb 4, 2025 by CPI', 'Brussels Advances AI Act Enforcement Despite US Pressure\nFeb 4, 2025 by CPI', 'Antitrust Chronicle® – International Criminal Enforcement\nJan 23, 2025 by CPI', 'The Antitrust Division’s Recent Work to Combat International Cartels\nJan 23, 2025 by Emma Burnham & Benjamin Christenson', 'Information Sharing: The New Frontier of U.S. Antitrust Enforcement\nJan 23, 2025 by Brian P.
