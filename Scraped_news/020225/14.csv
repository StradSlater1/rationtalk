How many more children have to fall victims to such acts of violence before you believe that this is a threat to public safety and order?,” he asked.', 'He argued the situation justified to use of extraordinary powers under EU treaties for “the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.”', 'He said that if his proposals get majority support, partially due to votes from the far-right AfD, that would make him “extremely uncomfortable,” but insisted this was necessary to deal with violence.', 'He told parliament that the sight of “cheering and grinning AfD MPs will be unbearable” but maintained that “a correct decision does not become wrong just because the wrong people agree, it remains right”.', 'He said he was no longer prepared to allow other parties to dictate what proposals and with whose support can be passed.', 'The European Commission included restrictions on sales of video games and joysticks to Russia in its 16th package of sanctions on Moscow, the proposal document showed.', 'The restrictions would impact sales of consoles such as Microsoft’s Xbox, the Nintendo Switch and Sony’s PlayStation.', '“Video game controllers, gaming controllers, flight simulator controllers, gamepads, joysticks and other input units, for video game consoles or entertainment systems, either corded or cordless” should be restricted, the proposal said.', 'Berlin correspondent', 'Listing Aschaffenburg as the latest in a string of attacks by migrants – in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg and Aschaffenburg – Scholz said he understood the shock and consternation that people felt, as well as vexation over the fact that “once again”, the attack had been “carried out by someone who shouldn’t have been here,” a reference to the fact that in several cases, the perpetrators had been due to be deported, but this had not happened.', '“I understand anyone who says: ‘I’ve had enough,’ said Scholz, adding: “I too am enraged”.', 'But he went on to say that all four of the attacks “could have been avoided” under existing laws which had been tightened under the Scholz government, if they had been properly and swiftly implemented by the authorities in the various states in which the attacks took place, all of which are governed by the CDU/CSU.', 'Scholz said under his government many more deportations had taken place, including a planeload of Afghans, convicted of crimes in Germany, stating that Germany was “the only country in Europe which has been able to deport criminals to Afghanistan. It’s damned hard to do with a Taliban government but we managed it.”', 'He urged Merz not to fall into the trap of depending on the AfD for support to push through his motions to tighten Germany’s migration policy, citing in particular a letter written by the leaders of Germany’s Protestant and Catholic churches, warning that the party was departing from the ‘Christian’ in its name by supporting the motions.', 'He also warned of developments in neighbouring Austria, where the conservatives there have, he said, broken pre-election promises not to work with the far-right FPÖ, the Austrian equivalent of the AfD, but was now on the verge of entering a coalition with it.', 'What is happening in the Bundestag this afternoon?', 'The conservative CDU/CSU alliance, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, who according to opinion polls is the favourite to become Germany’s chancellor following elections on February 23, has submitted two motions which, if passed, could result in a 180 degree switch in Germany’s migration policy, and could have a ripple effect across Europe.', 'The sense of urgency around the issues, which have been dominating the political landscape for some time, and reflect the wider debate across Europe, are due to events last week in the city of Aschaffenburg in which a two year old girl and a 41 year old man were murdered when an Afghan migrant lunged at them in a park with a kitchen knife. The 28 year old who is in police custody had been due for deportation. He had also been receiving help for a psychological condition.', 'The circumstances around the attack – and the fact that it is the latest in a series of attacks involving migrants who were known to authorities – have prompted accusations of state failure on many levels, with plenty of people in positions of authority insisting it could have been prevented.', 'The motions put forward by Merz call for the rejection of all illegal migrants and asylum seekers, wherever they have come from, on all of Germany’s nine borders with its neighbours. The motions would also seek to broaden the powers of the security authorities to ease the process of rejection and deportation.', 'Scholz’s SPD/Greens minority government has refused to back the proposals, saying that it too has a raft of reform proposals on which the CDU/CSU has refused to engage at all, despite Scholz’s appeal for cooperation so that they could be pushed through before the election.', 'It’s important to note that Merz’s proposals would not put the government of Olaf Scholz’s SPDs and Greens under obligation to act on them. But if the conservatives’ motions got majority support in the Bundestag it would greatly escalate tensions between the CDU and Scholz’s government and would give Merz the upper hand in terms of trying to push the motion into law, the process of which could start as early as Friday.', 'The real drama around today’s debate though is about who Merz will get support from. If as it has signalled, the far-right populist AfD lends him their support, opponents of the CDU/CSU leader say he will have effectively broken the so-called ‘firewall’ – on which he has said he will stake his political fate – the promise, along with other mainstream parties, that he will never work with the AfD.', 'A poll shows that 66% of Germans support Merz’s plan.', 'If his motion is successful, what then?', 'The CDU/CSU could get a wafer-thin majority with the help of the pro-business FDP, and the AfD, which said yesterday it was planning to vote in favour of the motions. The backing of the left-wing conservative BSW, which had not yet publicly made up its mind by this morning whether it would support Merz, would also be needed.', 'If he loses, this will be a humiliating defeat for Merz.', 'The Bundesrat or Upper House’s backing would be required to approve the law. The earliest date for a next sitting of that house would be 14 February, nine days ahead of the general election. However, they are not likely to approve it because the CDU/CSU does not have a majority there.', 'But, once the election has taken place on 23 February, the political landscape could look decidedly different.', 'The CDU/CSU would have effectively laid the ground for the law and would be potentially in a position to adopt the law with a new coalition partner. This is not unlikely to be the SPD, as a junior partner in a grand coalition.', 'In which case it is expected that in order to make it more palatable for the SPD, the law could be watered down in parts. Seeing as a large number of SPD voters are in general in favour of tightening the law, the SPD might find its hand is forced so that it too will end up supporting an asylum stop.', 'Scholz says that, particularly with Trump in the US, the European unity is more important than ever as he accuses the opposition that their proposals would break that solidarity between member states.', 'He says that the EU’s new common asylum system will help protect the external borders better.', 'But he warns that if the opposition’s proposals pass, “all of this would be at risk” a she says: “if we withdraw from the European rules, others will too.”', 'He then directly addressed the issue of the “firewall” that means isolating the far-right, says “there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats” on this issue.', 'He calls the opposition’s openness to pass the proposals with the AfD votes would be “an unforgivable mistake.”', 'He further warns by drawing comparisons between Germany and Austria, warning that when the firewall falls, it opens the way for far-right parties to join the government.']"

Germany Split on Eve of Elections?,https://www.kyivpost.com/post/46535,"['', 'EN', 'What the latest vote in the Bundestag – on tightening immigration controls – portends for the federal elections on Feb. 23.', 'A majority of the German Bundestag on Wednesday approved a non-binding motion put forward by the CDU/CSU faction to tighten the country’s migration policy, which includes the introduction of permanent border controls. The vote was hotly contested as it passed with the votes of the AfD, which is classified by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. Europe’s press weighs in.', 'Deep rifts in the center', '', 'In Luxemburg’s Tageblatt’s view all the democratic parties have failed to fulfil their responsibilities:', 'Solving problems in the political center to prevent the fringes from becoming strong. That’s what we want. It is also a failure on the part of the chancellor and the traffic light coalition that this was not achieved in the summer. But Merz has done the country no favors with his approach in the election campaign. Because since Wednesday the genie has been out of the bottle. The terrible acts of violence are a reminder. But the rifts between the democrats have become deeper. One can only hope that they can be overcome once the election campaign is over.', 'Yesterday’s idle talk', 'Austria’s Der Standard doesn’t trust Merz:', 'Never form a coalition with the AfD’: many people now find it far more difficult to believe Merz. And they’re right. People remember how Merz described the blue-black negotiations in Austria as a ‘disaster’ in Davos, and how he said in November that there should never be majorities with the AfD in the Bundestag, not even accidental ones. Clearly, however, this is just yesterday’s idle talk and should no longer interest anyone.', 'With the votes of a legal party', 'For Czechia’s Lidové noviny the fuss over Merz’s strategy is just as hypocritical as the way the AfD has been marginalized until now:', 'The AfD is by no means saintly. ... Nevertheless, it operates in a democratic context and no court has dissolved it. If the Constitutional Court had done so, things would be much clearer. But when party secretariats or newsrooms start playing the role of a court, something is out of joint. Friedrich Merz tried to break the curse. He used the AfD not as a coalition partner but as a regular political instrument. He presented a proposal to the Bundestag and called on everyone to support it. The majority turned out to be in favor of it – even if the left-wing establishment doesn’t like it.”', 'German politics no longer predictable', 'Poland’s Tygodnik Powszechny fears serious consequences for Poland:', 'Some illegal migrants still make their way to Germany either across the Polish-Belarusian border or via Poland from Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic. What if they’re now turned back at the German-Polish border? On such an emotional issue it’s easy to provoke a border crisis, and by extension a Polish-German row. What’s more, the upcoming elections may not produce a clear majority that is capable of governing. As a result, Angela Merkel’s migration policy as well as the political stability and predictability that characterized Germany under Merkel as well as her predecessors may be consigned to history.”', 'This will have consequences', 'The fact that this majority was achieved will leave a lasting mark on the political system, says Germany’s Stuttgarter Zeitung:', 'Germany changed so much on this day that historians will have their hands full dealing with it. Anyone who opens the door to cooperation, even a crack must fear that it will be pushed open with force at some point. The far-right AfD has never felt as powerful as it did this week. This will have lasting political consequences – and not just for people with a migration background.”', 'EU law can be changed', 'What’s needed is more pragmatism, Tagesschau.de recommends:', '‘Firewall’ debates are barely understood outside their own specific political bubbles. ... When speakers from the red-green coalition and the Green Party’s chancellor candidate Robert Habeck stress the importance of debate for democracy, they’re right. Only not in the way they intend: those who focus on what cannot be done create dissatisfaction and fuel people’s weariness of democracy. EU law, for example, which is often cited in this context, did not come out of nowhere: it was decided by politicians, and therefore can also be changed by them. And that is what the vast majority of people in this country expect.”', 'Perhaps also a reaction to Musk', 'Italy’s La Repubblica sees a sad change of direction in Germany:', 'With this move, the likely future German chancellor has broken a taboo that only applied in Germany - for obvious historical reasons. It is the erasure of the healthiest legacy from the long era of Angela Merkel, Merz’s great rival, who always adhered to the imperative ‘Never with the AfD’. At the same time, it’s as if the leader of the conservatives wanted to kowtow to the new Trump aide Elon Musk, who just two days ago yelled in the context of an Alice Weidel rally that the Germans need to stop being ashamed of their past.', 'Return to normality', 'Merz’s proposals are entirely reasonable, Switzerland’s Aargauer Zeitung nods:', 'Putting his ideas into practice would mean a return to normality in Europe: to a responsible asylum policy as practiced by the Federal Republic of Germany before Angela Merkel opened the borders. If they want to stop the rise of the AfD, the other parties won’t be able to avoid tightening asylum policy. Merz can hardly count on the Greens in future either: even now they’re calling for family reunification rules to be eased, confirming their status as misfits when it comes to migration policy. So Merz will have to hope that the SPD will be more realistic after the election.', 'Trampling on the lessons of history', 'Belgium’s Le Soir warns:', 'The far right is officially in power in Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Slovakia and Finland, and could also take over in Austria and the Czech Republic. And it dictates, in part, the moves of the Swedish and French governments. ... Now it is forming an alliance with the probable leader of the German coalition government. ... In light of the far right’s successes, many democratic parties are panicking and trying either to imitate it or cooperate with it, instead of resisting, defending fundamental values and human rights and fighting xenophobia and hatred as history – the very history that many democratic representatives of the people commemorated this week - so emphatically teaches us to do.', 'See the original here.', 'MENU', 'MULTIMEDIA', 'ABOUT', 'POLICIES', 'Web links to Kyiv Post material are allowed provided that they contain a hyperlink to the stories and only a brief extract (not more than 10 percent) of the text.', '© 1995-2025 BIZNESGRUPP TOV', 'All materials, including photographs, contained on this site are protected by copyright law and may not be reproduced without the prior written permission of BIZNESGRUPP TOV at news@kyivpost.com.

Hundreds of thousands of people have since taken to the streets to protest against the return of fascism.', 'On January 29, the conservative Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP) parliamentary groups in the Bundestag made common cause with the AfD to pass a motion calling for an intensification of the policy of sealing the borders and deporting refugees. In doing so, they made it clear that the “firewall” against the far-right party with its fascist “wing” is an illusion.', 'On Wednesday evening, Thursday and Friday, thousands of people marched in front of the CDU/CSU party headquarters to protest against the return of fascism. “Those who stay silent consent” and “There is no room for repetition in our history book,” read placards.', 'On Saturday and Sunday, there were demonstrations and rallies in practically every major city. The largest gatherings took place in Berlin and Hamburg, with 250,000 and 80,000 participants respectively. On Saturday, 44,000 took to the streets in Stuttgart, 40,000 in Cologne and over 10,000 in Bremen and Leipzig. In most cases, the number of participants far exceeded the expected numbers registered by the organizers with the authorities, such as in Essen, where more than 14,000 people turned up instead of the expected 3,000.', 'In Bavaria, 20,000 gathered in Regensburg on Sunday to demonstrate against right-wing extremism. Thousands also took to the streets in Würzburg, Augsburg, Passau, Kempten and Ingolstadt. In Munich, more than 6,000 people gathered in front of the CSU headquarters immediately after the Bundestag session on Wednesday.', 'In Göttingen, Hildesheim, Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Koblenz, Mainz, Trier and Aachen, around 5,000 protested against the AfD’s involvement in federal politics. In Frankfurt, a planned trade union demonstration against social cuts was turned into a protest against right-wing and racist politics, while over 10,000 people attended a rally in Neu-Isenburg, south of Frankfurt, to protest against an AfD election rally. In Apolda, in the state of Thuringia, almost 2,000 also took to the streets against a meeting of the AfD youth organization Junge Alternative.', 'Posters and banners with slogans such as “Never again is NOW,” “No human being is illegal” and “Colorful instead of brown” were carried everywhere. In addition to slogans against deportations and racism, many texts were also directed against the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate, such as: “No Merz from March,” a reference to the federal election set for February 23, “schMerz ease up,’ a play on words since “Schmerz” is the German word for pain, or “Human rights instead of Merz and the right.” On Friday, Friedrich Merz tried for the second time in the Bundestag to shred the last remnants of the right to asylum together with the AfD. However, the attempt to pass a law aimed at closing the borders to refugees failed to gain a majority.', 'Reporters from the World Socialist Web Site spoke to numerous participants who expressed their solidarity with migrants and refugees. Johannes, a Berlin student, said: “Minorities have been targeted here for years. I always imagine what it would be like if I were on the run myself. When I arrive somewhere, I would like to be welcomed and included.” He also found it wrong that “attacks are constantly being instrumentalised.”', 'Many of the participants were very young, and their statements and the numerous homemade cardboard signs testified to their anger and great willingness to fight. The concern about the return of fascism was palpable.', 'At the same time, however, a certain helplessness was evident. “We have to wake up,” said one participant in Berlin. “Democracy is going in the wrong direction.” Nadine, a nurse, said: “It makes me proud that so many people are going to the demonstration. But I’m already thinking that these demonstrations won’t be enough.”', 'The Social Democrats (SPD), Green and Left Party politicians, who suddenly appeared on the scene, did their utmost to channel the willingness to fight against the right into their respective election campaigns. All they had to offer was platitudes and hypocrisy. Against the backdrop of their right-wing policies, the politicians’ appearances were the height of cynicism.', 'In Cologne, SPD Health Minister Karl Lauterbach marched alongside Green politicians in the demonstration. Jan van Aken from the Left Party spoke out against “billionaires like Elon Musk.” In Berlin, the SPD leadership around Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken was on site, and Frankfurt publicist Michel Friedman, who left the CDU just three days earlier, recalled weakly the passage in Germany’s Basic Law that “human dignity is inviolable.”', 'The questions remained open as to how it could have come to this and what was the point of voting for the SPD, the Greens or even the Left Party today. The same parties have been tightening migration policy themselves for years, advocating “deportations on a grand scale” (SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz), actively supporting both the war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza financially and politically, and thus opening the door to the AfD.', '“Merz didn’t fall from the sky,” said Christoph Vandreier in Berlin. He made clear: “The SPD, Greens and Left Party are not allies in the fight against the fascists.” In fact, it was the SPD that deployed German tanks against Russia for the first time since World War II, supported genocide in the Gaza Strip and practically abolished the right to asylum. Vandreier urgently called for an international mobilization of workers and said: “The workers are the ones who create all the wealth in society and have to bear the entire burden of war and social polarization. They are the social force that can stop fascism.”', 'And he warned: “The rulers are increasingly relying on fascist and authoritarian methods to enforce war and social polarization.” The Socialist Equality Party (SGP) was in fact the only political force to warn at the weekend’s protests against this general course of development, explain its causes and show how it can be stopped.', 'At three separate rallies in Leipzig, Duisburg and Berlin, the SGP candidates warned: “If you pass motions and bills together with a far-right party, you can also govern together with it.” They appealed to the participants to become politically active themselves and to help build the only international and socialist party, the SGP.', 'Thousands of copies of the SGP statement with the headline: “The fight against fascism requires the fight against capitalism and war!” were distributed in many cities. It was sometimes almost snatched from the hands of SGP members. It says the following about the SPD and the Greens:', 'these parties bear a central responsibility for the rise of the AfD. The SPD and the Greens are not opposing the AfD and CDU’s refugee agitation and their racist law-and-order campaign but are instead fueling it.', 'SGP National Committee member K. Nesan also addressed the question of “Why?” in Stuttgart. He emphasized that 80 years after the end of the Nazi regime, Wednesday’s vote in the Bundestag had set the course for a repetition of the Nazis’ deportations. “The AfD, which calls for the ‘remigration’ of refugees and foreigners in its election program, is ready to form the next governing coalition,” said Nesan.', 'He was speaking at a memorial event at Stuttgart’s Nordbahnhof railway station in memory of the many thousands of Jewish men, women and children who were deported from there to extermination camps. On the current return of fascism, he raised the question: “How is this possible?” And he answered: “The open coalition of Friedrich Merz and the CDU with the AfD is the culmination of years of SPD and Green Party policies that implement the anti-immigration, anti-worker policies of the AfD. In the midst of the immense capitalist world crisis, the ruling class is turning to fascist forms of rule to suppress the emerging international class struggles.”', 'Nesan shouted: ‘This must be stopped, and it is possible to stop it! The prerequisite for this is the rejection of the pretensions of the SPD, the Greens and their accomplices in the Left Party and the pseudo-left that they are supposedly defending democracy. War and fascism can only be stopped through the intervention of the working class, which is fighting to end the capitalist system on the basis of a socialist perspective.’', 'The Christian Democrats have vividly demonstrated that they will not be dissuaded from embracing the Alternative for Germany (AfD), neither by mass protests nor by isolated critical voices within their own ranks.', 'Having twice voted with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in favor of a brutal policy of sealing the borders against refugees, the conservative Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP) parliamentary groups in the Bundestag are prepared to accept the far-right party as a government partner.', 'For the first time in the 75-year post-war history of the German parliament, one of the major parliamentary groups has made common cause with fascists to help an authoritarian and racist motion achieve a breakthrough.', 'On Wednesday, with the support of the Alternative for Germany, the Christian Democrats passed a motion on migration policy through the Bundestag which abrogates fundamental constitutional principles and European law.', '']"

The protests delayed the party’s election campaign event at the city hall, known as the Hugenottenhalle.', 'The party event, titled “Mega-Veranstaltung mit Alice Weidel” (Mega-Event with Alice Weidel), was a campaign rally for the party’s chancellor candidate. Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, was nominated last month at a party conference, which also sparked protests in Riesa.', 'The police estimated the number of protesters to be around 9,000, much higher than expected.

It is supposed to ensure that all democratic parties unite to keep out far-Right ones.', 'This week, the firewall was breached. In the German parliament, a motion calling for an end to illegal immigration was passed. This was made possible only by the fact that the far-Right AfD voted with the conservative Christian Democrats. (A comparable vote on asylum failed on Friday.)', 'This event shows how extremely rigorous the firewall doctrine is. The immigration motion and the asylum law were the creation, not of the AfD, but of the moderate Christian Democrats, who hope to win the coming general election. The only sin the Christian Democrats committed was to try to carry their policies with the help of AfD votes. The mere fact that a far-Right party supports something a mainstream party does is enough for firewallers to accuse that mainstream party of being anti-democratic.', 'It should be said that the firewall idea is, for Germany, understandable. In 1933, Zentrum, the conservative Catholic party, backed the Nazis’ Enabling Act in the Reichstag. This gave Hitler the parliamentary “supermajority” he needed to rule as a dictator. There were no further elections. The rest is history, of the darkest possible kind. No wonder the Germans ponder this carefully.', 'But, as a rule, there should not be firewalls in parliamentary democracies. In Berlin once upon a time, there was a real wall. The longing for a unified national democracy brought it down. Except in dire emergency, the wishes of voters at the ballot box should find expression in the way a country is governed. If they are not, those voters are driven to extremes. Then those extremes grow and the attempt to suppress them becomes conspicuously anti-democratic.', 'France is now all but ungovernable because the legitimate, but high-handed President Macron lost to the extremes the electoral mandate which he had unwisely called a special election to renew.', 'In Britain, we have paid a high price for the informal equivalent of the firewall. Whenever mainstream parties agree on a major issue, they in effect conspire against the public. Democracy suffers because there is inadequate scrutiny. Public disillusionment ensues.', 'On June 9 2008, under a Labour government, only five MPs opposed the second reading of the Climate Change Act. The three main parties agreed to it, almost without debate. Yet that measure has had vast consequences, imposing heavy, ongoing and rising expense upon British citizens and businesses. The Act also invented an “independent” permanent Committee on Climate Change which tries to dictate policy regardless of which party is in power.', 'Pursuant to the 2008 Act – this time under a Conservative government (Theresa May’s in 2019) – a binding net zero emissions target for 2050 was imposed by ministerial fiat. Today the expense of compliance is helping to kill the economic growth that Rachel Reeves desires. Again, the cross-party firewall kept debate at bay.', 'Another example is Britain’s membership of what ultimately became the European Union. From 1973 entry onwards, Labour and Conservative governments’ policies about EEC/EU membership and development, e.g. creating the single currency, were pretty much the same. Party rebels were severely punished. When Margaret Thatcher herself became a rebel against the cross-party consensus, her senior colleagues got her out. When the largest vote in British history chose Brexit in 2016, all three main political parties opposed it.', 'Yet another example is mass immigration. Although the two main parties have often made a show of difference here – with Labour accusing the Tories of racism and Tories attacking Labour for laxity – the reality has been that both parties, when in office, have largely endorsed the doctrines of multi-culturalism and the Treasury orthodoxy that economic growth can come only from immigrants. The noise of anyone trying to object has been muffled by the firewall.', 'The classic firewall case is that of the Equality Act of April 2010 (itself based on four EU Equal Treatment Directives), which replaced the common freedoms of all citizens with the concept of “protected characteristics”, such as race, disability or sexual orientation. It was passed in the dying days of the Brown administration. The Conservative-led coalition which arrived the following month zealously promoted the law it had inherited.', 'The Equality Act is the chief progenitor of the “diversity, equity and inclusion” industry which has created so much ill feeling and litigation in the workplace. It undermined the idea of appointment by merit and provoked bitter divisions about race and gender/sex. In the absence of a healthy debate among elected politicians, a new sect of human rights lawyers claimed jurisdiction. One of them is now our Prime Minister.', 'Again, no mainstream party raised serious objections at the time. Kemi Badenoch is the first mainstream party leader to address these issues head-on. It is not a coincidence that Reform rose out of the Brexit Party as public frustration about such questions grew.', 'It is also not a coincidence that the Civil Service, public bodies and big corporations used the democratic vacuum to create their own culture of “diversity, equity and inclusion” which means, in practice, uniformity, unfairness and cancellation.', 'Bureaucracies – public-sector, private-sector, charitable-sector, universities – could hide behind the firewall of mainstream party unanimity to impose a soft dictatorship on employees and customers. NatWest, that bastion of capitalism, was revealed to have withdrawn an account from Nigel Farage not because of his credit rating, but because of his politics.', 'Hence the growth of the phrase, “You can’t say that”, often used by the young to warn their politically incorrect parents, or by those same parents expressing private frustration. Free speech has been attacked not by a law which honestly, if disgustingly, proclaims, “We hereby abolish free speech”, but by the gradual creation of a language police, often promoted by pressure groups, such as Stonewall, which thrive on official encouragement and suffer little political check. Even pronouns have come under official control.', 'Here is a relatively minor example of linguistic interference in my own trade. According to our press regulator, IPSO, heeding advice from the Samaritans, we are not supposed to describe a person as having “committed suicide”. The reason, apparently, is that the phrase implies that suicide is a crime. I don’t think it does: people “commit adultery”, after all, and nobody (except sharia fanatics) thinks that should be a crime, as opposed to a wrong. But if the phrase “committing suicide” does carry the implication that suicide is a bad idea, what is wrong with that? And why shouldn’t journalists, right or wrong, be free to make up our own minds?', 'Some will agree that free speech needs protection but argue that some matters are so sensitive that certain views about them should not be publicly expressed. I cannot say that this is never true: sometimes considerations of civil peace or threat must weigh heavily. For example, it is right that critics of Israel in Gaza should be allowed to demonstrate their views in public, but wrong that they should be allowed to mass outside a synagogue to do so.', 'Nevertheless, the overall effect of the firewall is to diminish freedom and therefore democracy. It also has another effect which is too little considered. It causes so much anger that the language surrounding many sensitive subjects is coarsened. If woke’s suppression of normal opinion in the United States, for example, had not become so demented and so often enforced by oppressive laws, would Donald Trump have won his second term?', '', '', '', '', '']"

It proposes turning asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border, in a move that Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens have said contravenes both German and EU law on refugees.', 'The leader of the opposition CDU/CSU conservative alliance, which is leading the polls before the 23 February election, had shifted the debate on migration policy to the right, apparently in response to a knife attack last week in which two people were killed.

A doctor from Saudi Arabia was arrested after that incident.', 'An unusually heated debate preceded the vote. Scholz attacked Merz for “having effectively cancelled the fundamental agreement of our republic in the heat of the moment”, by riding on the expectation that his motions would only stand a chance of success if they were supported by the anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin AfD. Scholz called it an “unforgivable mistake”.', 'He said that by relying on the support of the AfD, “the very same ones who are fighting against our democracy, who despise our united Europe, who have continued to poison the climate in our country for years”, Merz had overstepped “boundaries that as a statesman one should not overstep”.', 'Robert Habeck, the deputy chancellor and the Greens’ candidate for chancellor, urged Merz: “Mr Merz, don’t vote with racists. It is not necessary and it is ill-advised.”', 'Merz, however, said that getting his plans over the line with the help of the AfD would be merely “a last resort”. “It might be the case that the AfD enables the necessary majority for a law for the first time,” he said, adding that the thought of “jubilant and smirking AfD MPs”, caused him discomfort.', 'The AfD parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, who was duly pictured laughing with and hugging party members after the result came in, said: “The so-called firewall is nothing other than an anti-democratic cartel agreement.” Merz’s migration plan, she added, had been “copied from us”.', 'Sign up to This is Europe', 'The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment', '', 'Merz intends to put to parliament on Friday a draft migration bill furthering the existing measures already passed.

The highly-controversial proposal, put forward by the CDU/CSU opposition party which leads in the polls, failed to secure a majority in the Bundestag, despite the backing of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.', 'A group of French lawmakers reached a provisional agreement on an amended text of the budget, which is expected to be put to vote in the parliament on Monday.

Boats are frequently crammed with unaccompanied minors.', 'Greece’s centre-right government has applied what it has called a “tough but fair” migration management policy. But for migrant solidarity workers, the measures, including containing refugees in closed controlled access centres (CCAC) on Aegean isles, have been unduly harsh - a reflection, say NGOs, not only of political sentiment across the continent but of the unspoken desire to deter would-be asylum seekers from making similar journeys.', 'This week, the Human Rights Legal Project (HRLP), described conditions in the safe zone area of Samos island’s CCAC’s – the zone where unaccompanied minors reside – as “horrific.”', '“The area, which was originally designed to accommodate 200 children, is now hosting 485 unaccompanied minors, many of whom lack shoes and adequate clothing,” it said.', 'Shortages not only included beds and lack of access to education and health services but basic products such as soap and toothpaste.', 'Refugee Support Aegean, another NGO, also deplored the “inadequate presence of organisations and authorities” to deal with the upsurge in flows to the country.

If the 66 Socialist deputies do vote against it, the bill will not pass.\n\nBayrou will spend the weekend trying to win over as much support as he can, but if he considers the risk of the budget being voted down is too great he may be tempted to make use of the controversial constitutional tool known as article 49.3.\n\nThis allows a government to push certain kind of legislation through parliament without a vote - but also allows MPs the chance to challenge that decision by submitting a no-confidence motion that is generally voted on 48 hours later.\n\nIt was just such a motion that saw off Barnier’s government at the end of last year, and France’s parliamentary arithmetic has not changed: the pro-Macron, centrist alliance plus the centre-right bloc can muster only 211 votes in the 577-seat house.\n\nThe Socialists have not said how they would vote on a no-confidence motion, which would almost certainly be submitted by LFI, and they – and, perhaps, the RN – may decide the stakes are now too high to bring down another government so early.\n\nBut it would take fewer than half of PS deputies to join LFI, the RN and the rest of the opposition in voting in favour of a censure motion for Bayrou’s government to suffer the same fate as his predecessor’s – as early as next Wednesday.\n\nWatch this space.', 'As we await the result of the vote in Germany, let’s take a super quick look at the situation in France again…', 'Back to the Bundestag where a late attempt to refer the draft law back to the committee was rejected.', 'The parliament is now voting on the second reading of the draft law, with results expected by 16:50 CET.', 'Who will vote in favour?
