War-ravaged Syria is looking to Gulf countries to finance reconstruction and revive its economy.\nSharaa “will pay a visit to Ankara on Tuesday at the invitation of our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,” Fahrettin Altun, head of communications at the presidency, said on X on Monday.\nTurkiye, which has had close ties with Sharaa, reopened its diplomatic mission in the Syrian Arab Republic and sent its spy chief and foreign minister for talks with the new leader soon after Assad was toppled by the HTS group.\nTalks between Erdogan and Sharaa at the presidential palace in the capital Ankara will focus on “joint steps to be taken for economic recovery, sustainable stability and security” in Syria, Altun said.\n“We believe that the Turkiye-Syria relations, which were re-established after Syria regained its freedom, will be strengthened and gain dimension,” he added.', 'GAZA: The emotional reunion of twin brothers in Gaza after Israel allowed movement within the enclave as part of a ceasefire deal provided a visceral image of Palestinian survival after 15 gruelling months of death, separation and destruction.\nVideo of the twins’ ecstatic, tearful embrace amid the crowds of people trekking home a week ago from displacement camps was widely viewed around the world. But Ibrahim and Mahmoud Al-Atout had both endured loss and hardship that tinged the joy of their reunion.\n“I didn’t want to let go of him. It’s like the soul returned to the chest, the soul returned to the heart,” said one of the 30-year-old twins, Mahmoud, speaking about their experience days later in a video obtained by Reuters.\nThe two men, from the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, were split up early in the conflict that began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and seizing about 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\nThe Israeli military campaign in Gaza killed more than 47,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and levelled much of the enclave.\nEarly on, Israel ordered civilians to leave the north, where its military operations were most intense, but not everybody did so. Those who did travel south were barred from returning until last week as part of the deal for a ceasefire and hostage release.\nIbrahim had ended up in the south, while Mahmoud stayed in the north.\nWhen news came late one night that he could go back to Jabalia, Ibrahim phoned Mahmoud, who quickly dressed and rushed to a meeting point on a main road into northern Gaza.\n“Imagine: I stood on my feet for six hours, standing around looking like this (and wondering) ‘where is Ibrahim? Where is Ibrahim?,’” said Mahmoud in the video obtained by Reuters.\nPeople coming up from the south kept mistaking him for his brother, Mahmoud said, surprised he had come north so quickly. They then would tell him to wait longer because Ibrahim was traveling with his six young daughters and had to go slowly.\n“He called out to me ‘Mahmoud’, and I couldn’t comprehend. I ran quickly and we hugged each other,” he said, describing their moment of reunion.\nTogether again\nNow reunited, the two men and their families say they spend time picking through the ruins of their family home, destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in November 2023 that killed one of Ibrahim’s daughters and injured another in her head and legs.\nPalestinians accuse Israel of indiscriminate bombardment. Israel says Hamas hides among the civilian population and it tries to hit the group while minimizing harm to civilians.\nIbrahim had not wanted to go south. But Israeli forces had moved toward north Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital while he was there with his family and the Red Crescent moved them all to a bigger hospital in the south where better treatment was available.\nAs each man spoke in the video obtained by Reuters, using big arm movements to illustrate their points, the other sat still and quiet, taking it in.\nThings were hard for Ibrahim and his family in the south without home or possessions, and communications were cut off for about four months.\n“I was devastated to the point where I lost weight,” said Mahmoud of that time.\nTogether again, they sat in the evening with a fire by the rubble of their home, cooking bread on a metal shelf, their small children gazing at them with delight.', 'LONDON: Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber

mediators to ensure that the occupation adheres to the agreement and does not stall,” they added.\nA second official said the group was “waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round.”\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel — the first phase of which came into effect on January 19 — indirect talks to hammer out the details of phase two were due to start

Shara is now responsible for forming an interim legislative council until a new constitution is drafted and approved, according to the conference.[2] Shara, at the conference, identified his priorities as ”filling the power vacuum, preserving civil peace, building state institutions, working to build a developmental economic infrastructure, and restoring Syria's international and regional standing” in his speech.[3] Shara has previously described the interim government overseeing a three-to-four year transition period, during which he would presumably rule and exert heavy influence over the allocation of political power.[4]"", 'The victory conference separately announced the disbanding of all Assad regime institutions and its constitution.[5] The interim government has proposed previously holding a representative Syrian national dialogue to write a new Syrian constitution, though it is unclear whether a date or any participants have yet been identified.[6]', 'The victory conference also announced the planned dissolution of all former opposition parties in Syria.

', 'But the government’s focus on the economy, in particular, would seem very much in line with the priorities of Syrians, 90 percent of whom are currently living in poverty according to the UN.', 'During his recent month-long visit in Syria, Ghanem stayed in his family’s home and learned what it was like to live with very limited electricity in the depths of winter, conditions all too familiar for Syrians throughout the country.

Syria enters new era amidst uncertainties,https://www.indianpunchline.com/syria-enters-new-era-amidst-uncertainties/,"['INDIAN PUNCHLINE', 'The appointment of Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as Interim President on January 29 marks the advent of a new era in Syria’s history. The New York Times in a feature article on al-Sharaa called the HTS an “Islamist rebel group once linked to Al Qaeda.” [Emphasis added.] ', 'Times was evasive about the years he spent in detention in the custody of the US occupation forces in Iraq or why was he released despite being a top ISIS functionary and allowed to go to Syria at the outbreak of a civil war (where in the Jihadi cauldron ISIS and al-Qaeda were hyperactive) to form the Nusra Front, an affiliate of al Qaeda, but “eventually broke ties with Al Qaeda, and the Nusra Front evolved into Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.” [Emphasis added.]', 'It is not uncommon for yesterday’s “terrorists” to transform as politicians by tomorrow but that is insufficient to explain away the leniency that US military showed under the circumstances to legitimise Nusra Front / HTS. The phobia against al-Qaeda was the creation of the West to give justification to their Islamophobia and Koran burning habits and conjure up the myth of “Islamic terrorism” as geopolitical tool. Now the Americans themselves find it  expedient to legitimise al-Qaeda as the locomotive of change in the Muslim Middle East. What a paradox!', 'Anyway, Times goes on to say, “After sweeping to power in Syria last month, Mr. al-Sharaa has seemed to be trying to distance himself from his militant past, ditching his combat fatigues and donning a suit and tie … By eschewing global jihadist ambitions, Mr. al-Sharaa apparently hopes to gain international legitimacy… There are signs that the strategy may be working.” ', 'Indeed, it is. The US has lifted a $10 million bounty on his head and partially eased its economic and financial sanctions against Syria —with the EU in tow. Foreign delegations are queuing up to meet al-Sharaa in Damascus, not only from the US and its European allies but Gulf Arab states, Palestine and Turkey — even Pakistan. Some countries are still holding out, too — China, India, Iran amongst them — given their disquiet that the dividing line between terrorism and Islamist extremism dissipated so easily. ', 'Indeed, the jaw-dropping event last week has been the overnight visit to Damascus on January 28-29 by an inter-ministerial delegation from Moscow headed by Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Special Representative for the Middle East. The Russian visit messaged that al-Sharaa is someone Moscow can do business with. ', 'No sooner than the Russian delegation flew back to Moscow, al-Sharaa’s appointment was announced. Maybe, that was a coincidence, or perhaps, Turkey, which calls the shots in Damascus, wanted precisely such a sequencing. ', 'To be sure, Russian diplomacy is shifting gear. A foreign ministry statement in Moscow said Bogdanov “engaged in substantive discussions” with al-Sharaa. The statement signalled Russia’s willingness to upgrade the relationship with the Islamist government and to extend essential assistance “at this pivotal moment.” ', 'The statement concluded that “Both parties agreed to maintain bilateral engagement with a view to formalising pertinent arrangements, reflecting a mutual resolve to deepen comprehensive ties and understanding between Moscow and Damascus, including in foreign policy spheres.” Moscow seems satisfied with the constructive engagement has formally begun. ', 'There was no reference to the status of the Russian bases, but Bogdanov revealed later that the two sides discussed the issue and agreed to continue consultations. Meanwhile, the Russian military presence remains unchanged. ', 'Bogdanov told journalists: “The meeting (with al-Sharaa) went well overall. It lasted three hours, including an official dinner… The meeting was generally constructive, there was a good atmosphere. But we understand how difficult the (Syrian) situation is.”', 'Bogdanov said Russia maintained “unwavering support for the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty” of the country, and added: “This is the most important thing. The fact that Syria has been going through in recent years, and the fact that there has been a change of leadership in such a dramatic way, does not change our assessments and our readiness to help stabilise the situation in order to find adequate solutions to socio-political and socio-economic problems.”', 'Russia seems to have struck an equilibrium in Syria, but then, it is no stranger to the mystique of violent Islamism. Importantly, Moscow remains vigilant about the past cold-war experience of the West pitting militant Islam against Russia. A report in the Russian daily Vedomosti (in Russian) nicely captured the quintessence of Moscow’s carefully choreographed diplomatic tango with its catchy title, “What do the new Syrian authorities and Russia want from each other: Bashar al–Assad‘s winners – “compensation“, Moscow – “preservation of military bases.” ', 'There is no question that al-Sharaa’s emergence as a politician and statesman is now an irreversible geopolitical reality. It is further confirmed with the visit by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to Damascus on Thursday. Upon arrival, Sheikh Tamin announced, “Qatar will continue standing with its Syrian brothers to help them achieve their aspirations for a nation built on unity, justice, and freedom, where its people can live with dignity.” ', 'Conceivably, Qatar loosened its purse strings to persuade disparate groups to align with the HTS. Turkish muscle power combines with Qatar’s wealth to provide the alchemy for the new transitional government. Qatar was a key player fuelling the bloody Syrian civil and it is now back on the Middle Eastern chessboard as the benefactor of Hamas and HTS. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who also funded the jihadi groups in Syria, must have been taken aback by Qatar’s cheekiness. ', 'As interim head of state, al-Sharaa has been entrusted with forming a legislative council to oversee the transition. He has been authorised to form a temporary legislative council that would remain in place until a permanent constitution is drafted and enacted. The duration of the transitional period is unclear. What happens now to the national dialogue conference idea, which the new rulers had previously pledged to organise, also remains fuzzy.', 'However, the administration has introduced significant political and security reforms. All security agencies affiliated with the Assad regime have been proscribed; Baath Party and all other National Progressive Front parties have been disbanded and their assets confiscated; and a blanket ban has been imposed on reviving  these parties under any new name. Equally, all military factions, revolutionary political bodies, and civil organisations have merged into state institutions. ', 'Looking ahead, the role of the external powers remains crucial. Evidently, Turkey, Russia and the Arab countries (and Iran, of course) are stakeholders in Syria’s stability. But the same cannot be said for Israel, which prioritises the projection of power into Syria’s political vacuum. The Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, while on a field trip to the newly conquered Syrian side of Mount Hermon on Tuesday, defiantly proclaimed on Tuesday that the Israeli occupation of newly conquered territory will continue “indefinitely.”', 'Israel has comprehensively destroyed Syria’s military capacity to defend itself for the foreseeable future. Basically, Israel wants to keep Syria weak and unstable and prevent any return of Iranian presence. Israel hopes to divide Syria into four cantons with control over southern cantons dominated by US-backed Islamist groups that are working with Israel and influence over a northern canton controlled by the Kurdish groups (who are its proxies against Turkey.) ', 'Israel counts on the the US to align with it on Syria, but President Trump may not be amenable. Israel’s official public broadcasting Kan reported Tuesday that “senior White House officials conveyed a message to their Israeli counterparts indicating that President Trump intends to pull thousands of US troops from Syria.” (According to a Pentagon announcement in December, the US has some 2,000 troops deployed in Syria.) ', 'When asked about the Kan report, President Trump retorted, “I don’t know who said that, but we’ll make a determination on that. We’re not involved in Syria. Syria is in its own mess. They’ve got enough messes over there. They don’t need us involved.” That leaves Israel and Turkey staring at each other. A showdown could be approaching.', 'Mail to me your questions, feedback and suggestions at indianpunchline@gmail.com']"

Instead, al-Sharaa has positioned himself and his group as credible caretakers of a Syria liberated from al-Assad, who brutally repressed a popular uprising during the Arab Spring in 2011.', 'Since al-Assad’s removal, HTS has become the de facto ruling party and has set up an interim government largely composed of officials from the local government it previously ran in rebel-held Idlib province.', 'In recent weeks, al-Sharaa has met with foreign leaders and diplomats, United Nations officials and International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan.', '', '', '', 'This week, European Union foreign ministers discussed the matter at a meeting in Brussels.', 'Some EU sanctions on Syria will be lifted as part of a broader EU move to help stabilise Damascus, France’s foreign minister said.', 'The United States and the EU introduced a series of crippling sanctions on Syria in 2011, denying Damascus access to capital markets and trade revenues.

At one point the party ruled two Arab countries, Iraq and Syria.', 'In Syria, the Baath party became inextricably associated with the al-Assad family, which took power in 1970. For decades, the family used the party and its pan-Arab ideology to control the country. Many senior military jobs were held by members of the family’s minority Alawite sect, and party membership was used as a cover to give it a nationalist rather than a sectarian nature.', 'Following al-Assad’s ouster, many members of the party’s leadership went into hiding or fled the country. In a symbolic move, Syria’s new rulers have turned the former party headquarters in Damascus into a centre where former members of the army and security forces line up to register their names and hand over their weapons.', 'Follow Al Jazeera English:']"
