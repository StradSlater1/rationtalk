Now they are no longer a winning machine, but play with only one formula and are seemingly incapable of changing up a few gears during matches. They can become infuriatingly dull to observe."", ""Arsenal's performance after losing that goal to Haaland was an object lesson in pace, imagination, the fearlessness of youth and the ability to slip through the gears effortlessly leaving the visitors stalled on the starting grid.

Arsenal’s rout of Manchester City shows how great empires end,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/03/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league,"['Pep Guardiola was thought to have stabilised City’s form, but Sunday’s 5-1 demolition by Arsenal shows that the champions’ reign is now surely over', 'By the time Ethan Nwaneri whipped in Arsenal’s fifth, the mood at the Emirates was euphoric. The 17-year-old’s finish, arced into the bottom corner from that inside-right position through which so many of Arsenal’s attacks had come, felt like the perfect finale to a dominant 5-1 win over reigning Premier League champions Manchester City. And it was, in more ways than one.', 'Its youthful chutzpah seemed an appropriate way to round off a win in which 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly had been the most eye-catching player, having scored the third goal with an impudent shimmy into the box. Yet there was a strange realisation on seeing the replay. Nwaneri’s finish hadn’t nestled in that close to the corner of the goal; it wasn’t quite as good as it had initially appeared. And that felt emblematic of the game as a whole.', 'Of course Arsenal were magnificent – the first team ever to score five against a Pep Guardiola side and win by four or more goals. Of course they deserve enormous credit, particularly given the scars left by the run of 12 successive league defeats to City that culminated with Pep Guardiola’s side effectively sealing the title against Arsenal in April 2023. Of course there was much to admire in their youthful intent. But equally there was a strange feeling that, memorable as Mikel Arteta’s triumph over his mentor was, Arsenal hadn’t needed to be that good to win.', 'City had equalised at 1-1 in the second half, and in that moment there was a sense that Arsenal had allowed them back into the game. Goalkeeper David Raya had already been forced into two fine saves, Kai Havertz had missed a glaring chance and there was a growing feeling that Arsenal’s diffidence might cost them, that they were somehow playing less the City of today than the image of City implanted in their head by those six years of defeat. By the end they were rampant, scoring 105 seconds after City’s equaliser as part of four unanswered goals in the match’s final 37 minutes. Yet their xG for the game was, according to one model, only 1.06. As much as anything else, this was about City’s soft centre, about the way the fight left them entirely.', 'Is this the end? Not just for this season but for the Guardiola project as a whole? There’s a reluctance to call it, if only because City have been so dominant, because they have enjoyed such advantages, because Guardiola has been so obviously the most significant figure in shaping the tactical direction of the game over the past 15 years. Can it really be over? Is that it? Defeat at Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, a month of nonsense, and – boom! – that’s it, no mas?', 'Champions rarely lose so heavily, but Liverpool did in 2020, going down 7-2 at Aston Villa. Although that was a dreadful season for them, including a run of six straight home league defeats, it happened amid the strangeness of the Covid lockdown and Liverpool did ultimately rally to finish third. Generally, the precedents for City are not good: the closest analogy is perhaps Inter, who collapsed in the final weeks of 1966-67. Dominant under Helenio Herrera, who had reshaped the tactical landscape just as surely as Guardiola, they won only two of their final 11 games of the season, losing in a European Cup final and Coppa Italia semi-final and surrendering the league title, and were never quite the same again.', 'As with City, the sense was of injury and fatigue triggering crisis in a squad that had perhaps grown stale and, once their aura had gone, it turned out they had no way back. City have stabilised to an extent: they had lost just one of their nine fixtures before the capitulation at the Emirates. There had been a sense of normality returning, while the wave of new signings plus Erling Haaland’s new contract had suggested a club girding itself for a rebuild. It was not the calm, gradual process of the past few seasons, an indication of how recruitment had gone awry, but the chaos of November and December was over. Would it perhaps come to be seen as two bizarre, freakish months?', 'Sunday proved it was not. City remain staggeringly open. They make mistakes. They do not press with the precision they used to. Opponents no longer fear them, rather seeing in them an opportunity for a notable result. After Leyton Orient in the FA Cup, they face Real Madrid, Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, who have already beaten them twice this season. This could be another month of misery for City.', 'And what then? Can the rebuild work, or is something too far broken? Guardiola has been a manager at the top of the game for 17 years; few last more than a decade. Does he still have the energy to keep fighting, to keep evolving, to start again? History suggests few come back from seasons like this, that auras once lost are rarely reestablished. Guardiola is close to unique, but restoring City to dominance may be beyond even his abilities.', 'You’re 23, you’ve just moved from Chacarita Juniors to one of the biggest clubs in Argentina and you’re told you’ll be making your debut in the Superclásico for Boca Juniors against River Plate. What do you hope for? Perhaps you’d be happy to simply not make a fool of yourself, to just get through the game with the eyes of the nation upon you? But Carlos María García Cambón got off to the perfect start, seizing on a long ball and smashing his finish past Ubaldo Fillol to give Boca a second-minute lead.', 'But that was only the start of it. By full time on 3 February 1974, Cambón had become the first – and, as yet, the only – player ever to score four in a Superclásico as Boca won 5-2. It was arguably the greatest debut in history. Perhaps inevitably there was a sense of anticlimax after that. Cambón had already won an unlikely Metropolitano with Chacarita but he lifted only one further Metropolitano and one National with Boca and by 1977 he had moved on to Unión de Santa Fe. He wound down his career in Greece with Olympiakos and then in the USA with Rochester Lancers and the Las Vegas Eagles before returning to Argentina with Loma Negra de Olavarría.', 'This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.

In that moment, you have to do what you have to do.', '[Why do you keep collapsing under pressure?] No, every game is different. It’s football. You have to know in certain positions when there is a risk. But the really is that we played long balls. And what happened every time we played long balls?', '[You lost it]', 'We lost it and they came back stronger. Winning balls against Saliba and Gabriel is not easy, not even for Erling. The last 20 minutes we were tired and affected emotionally. Football is sometimes about moments – you have to resist and then come back in the good moments.', '[On Haaland barely touching the ball] He has two central defenders and two holding midfielders so narrow. Sometimes it’s not easy to find him. You have to be patient.', '[Why are you losing the ball more often in dangerous areas?] Maybe the opponents are more aggressive. Sometimes it happens but this season we have gone behind in many, many games and lost points.', '[Are you in transition?] We will see. We will see. The players are getting old, just like the manager is getting old; it’s normal. But we’re still in February, there are a lot of games to play.', '* I’m not sure he meant this in the colloquial sense, it was hard to hear what he said afterwards.', 'Apparently the Arsenal DJ played Kendrick Lamar’s Humble at the final whistle. I don’t know about you but I can’t wait for their next meeting, ideally in a Champions League semi-final.', 'David Hytner’s match report', '“Looking at the table three days ago, I couldn’t help but feel that goal difference was a huge advantage for City in the Champions League race,” says Liam Curson. “It was 11 better than Forests. Now, they’re both on +13. Insanity.”', 'John Stones gives the City reaction', 'It’s difficult. All of us don’t take losing well. It’s hard for me to put into words actually, straight after a game like that. Our pride’s hurt… sorry to the fans who travelled to come and watch that. How we played in the last 30 minutes was not acceptable.', 'As a collective, it’s not us. It’s not nice to be involved in that when you know it’s not your team or yourself. Credit to Arsenal, this is not an easy place to come to and they played really well against us. In the first hour we played some great football at times and we were in the game. It was a swinging point, and unfortunately it swung the wrong way for us.', 'I’m angry, upset, personally and collectively, at how the game finished. For many reasons.', '[Why the collapse?] I dunno. That’s the magic question. To equalise was a great feeling and a good situation to be in. To concede after that from a deflection… I could have stayed more square, maybe, I’ll have to watch it back. It’s a split-second decision. We can’t let those situations get on top of us. We stopped doing the things we were meant to… difficult for me to put into words.', 'To allow them to have so much of the ball towards the end is frustrating when we’re a team that is usually so good at keeping the ball and controlling the tempo of the game. I’ve been on both sides of it and today was the wrong side to be on. The dressing-room is an emoptional place in many ways.', 'We want to bounce back, quickly. Not erase it – I believe these things make you stronger and will make us realise what we’ve done over the last eight years and what we’re capable of doing. We need to make it right.', 'I wouldn’t say [City’s era of dominance] is coming to an end. There are a lot of different things that I still haven’t figured out as to why it hasn’t clicked. The heart’s there, the passion’s there; everyone’s got the right intention. We all need to stick together. That’s a key point, that we don’t start pointing fingers and that we look at ourselves first and foremost.', 'Declan Rice’s verdict', 'It’s an unbelievable score. From the moment we went on the pitch we had that fire in our belly; we really wanted to win the game after what happened at the Etihad.', 'Until they scored their goal I thought it was an even game. They still posed a threat and had a lot of the ball. We had to sit deep at times. They’re still a top side and they can still punish teams.', 'When it went 1-1 you think maybe the momentum could shift, but we got Thomas’s goal from another high press and keep pushing after that. To win 5-1 was top but I thought it was a really tough game; that’s how it felt out there anyway.', 'The rivalry has been building for a while. They nicked the title off Arsenal the year I wasn’t here, then last season they beat us to the title. It’s been hard to accept that, and then with everything that went on at the Etihad earlier in the season, you do have that fire in the stomach. We wanted to make amends.', 'We’re so, so happy. But there’s still such a long way to go and we’re still a couple of points (sic) off the top and that’s where we want to be.', '[On getting two assists] Yeah I was really pleased with that, especially the last one. I don’t think many people think I’ve got that in my locker! I saw it five seconds before and knew I was gonna play it out to Ethan even before I got the ball. I need to keep adding goals and assists to my game, especially if I keep playing the No8 position.', 'I’m feeling way better than I did at the start of the season. I just want to keep going and help this club win silverware. That’s why I’m here and why everyone else is here.', 'Liverpool are still quite far in front, especially with the game in hand. Respect to them; it’s down to us to hunt them. We knew we had to win today. It’s been one of the best days since I’ve been at Arsenal.', 'Martin Odegaard', 'Tough game, top performance. With a scoresheet like that it can’t be better so we’re very happy. In the end I think we got what we deserved.', '[On Havertz] He had a massive impact again today with and without the ball. He’s a top player, an intelligent player. We understand each other well and have a good connection.', 'Kai Havertz', 'We managed to press them quite well, we didn’t give them much time. Our energy was good and we took our chances.', '[What’s the key to the press?] It’s the timing, you know? We work on it a lot. We [Havertz and Odegaard] are the first ones to press but we need everyone to push and the rest of the team did it excellently as well.', '[On his goal] It was lovely to see it go in. I was a bit frustrated from my chance in the first half.', 'I think I did Nwaneri a disservice. Yes, his curler wasn’t right in the corner but it was close enough and a brilliant goal by anyone, never mind a 17-year-old.', 'The updated Premier League table', 'For whatever reason, and you can’t argue with the outcome, Arsenal only really went for City at 2-1. When it was 1-0, effectively the same score, they were happy to play at a slower pace. Maybe, given the devastating timing of Thomas Partey’s goal, they sensed City’s vulnerability; if so their game awareness is immaculate because they upped the tempo and were rampant for the rest of the match.', '“My dad who was an Arsenal supporter from when he was a lad in the 1920s passed it onto me,” writes David Paradine. “He died more than 30 years ago but at times like this I still find myself sharing the moment with him.”', 'I didn’t think I’d be mentioning Minnie Driver today but she was on a fascinating podcast in which she and a psychotherapist (I think) talk about how your relationship with your parents evolves even after they’ve gone. I’d recommend it, it was really thought-provoking.', 'Edit: thanks to Jon Hallam for sending in the link.', 'There was no needle at the final whistle, at least not on the field. Gabriel was engaged in conversation with Matheus Nunes, who looked tempted to chin him at one stage, but he thought better of it and Jack Grealish walked him down the tunnel.', 'Arsenal have moved to within six points of Liverpool after savaging Manchester City in the second half. When Erling Haaland scored a superb equaliser City were arguably favourites; Thomas Partey scored 38 seconds after the restart and then City were taken apart.', 'Myles Lewis-Skelly, Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri scored fine goals, each rousing because of the personal context, and the last 10 minutes might be the most humiliating of Pep Guardiola’s entire career. City didn’t look beaten, they looked broken.', 'Wow.', 'Rice, the unsung hero of this win, pinged a crossfield pass out to Nwaneri on the right. He cut inside from the right, 20 yards from goal, and whipped a curler into the far side of the goal. It wasn’t right in the corner but it was still a beautiful goal, an homage to the injured Bukayo Saka.', 'Ethan Nwaneri, 17 years old, completes the humiliation with a delicious goal!', '90 min There will be three minutes of added misery for City. Even allowing for the devastating timing of Arsenal’s second goal, it’s been another extraordinary collapse.', '90 min: Arsenal substitution Riccardo Calafiori and Raheem Sterling replace Kai Havertz and the wonderful Myles Lewis-Skelly. I’ve just realised that, when he scored, Lewis-Skelly mimicked Erling Haaland’s meditation celebration. Six months ago he hadn’t played a single minute in the Premier League; now he’s goading the league’s biggest goal machine.', '89 min City have had some terrible defeats this seaosn. This feels like the most humiliating, possibly because of the sneering and the schadenfreude coming from every corner of the ground.', 'Meanwhile, Nwaneri’s corner is headed against the outside of the near post by Timber. The angle was almost impossible.', '88 min “Some matches are more personally resonant than others,” says Kári Tulinius. “A friend converted me to Arsenal fandom, and today I travelled to his hometown for his funeral. I don’t think the universe takes heed of that sort of thing, but I can’t help but be thankful that the Gunners have played so well today.”', 'I’m really sorry to hear that. When Lewis-Skelly scored I started thinking about Andrew Hurley, an Arsenal fan and MBM regular who died last year at a shockingly young age. I wish he was around to enjoy this.', '87 min Bernardo Silva, pushed to breaking point by some olé football, leaves plenty on an Arsenal player. I’m nopt sure who it was but the ball had long gone.', '86 min “We’re not scoring enough goals,” says Matt Emerson. “We look light up front. We need a forward in the transfer window…”', 'Stay humble.', '85 min “You’re getting sacked in the morning!” shout the Arsenal fans, who are having the kind of party they never thought possible against a Pep Guardiola team.', '84 min: Double substitution for Arsenal Ethan Nwaneri and Mikel Merino replace Trossard, who was good, and Odegaard, who was Odegood.', 'Sorry.', '83 min Haaland is penalised for a foul on Gabriel. He offers his hand, which Gabriel ignores. “He’s gotta snap soon, surely,” laughs Gary Neville on Sky. “I don’t think anyone who’s played football would begrudge Erling Haaland losing his rag and going for Gabriel.”', '81 min The odd thing about this is that Arsenal now need a favour from City, who host Liverpool later in the month. Arsenal could win their last 14 games and still not catch Liverpool, but the manner and emotion of this victory will make them feel they are still well in the title race.', '80 min There are more goals out there for Arsenal. City look shell shocked.', '79 min The key moment in the game, no question, was Partey’s goal at 1-1. City were on top when Haaland equalised; he seemed to have shut the home crowd up. And he had – but only for about a minute and a half.', 'Arsenal have destroyed City in transition all day. This time Martinelli, found superbly by Partey, led the counter-attack from deep in his own half. He ran to the edge of the area, waiting for Havertz to make a run outside, and then gave him the ball.', 'Havertz skipped calmly back inside Stones and slapped the ball into the far corner. It’s a terrific finish, even more so after his earlier miss, and he slides on his knees in celebration. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen him celebrate a goal quite so demonstratively, not even in the Champions League final.', 'A moment of pharmaceutical-grade euphoria for Kai Havertz!', '74 min Lewis-Skelly zips infield then sets off on a penetrative straight run before being fouled by Haaland. “He’s a joy! He’s a joy!” says Gary Neville on commentary. Even Ashley Cole wasn’t this good at 18; in fact at the same age he hadn’t played a senior game.', '73 min Arsenal have upped the tempo since going 2-1 ahead and City have struggled to cope. I can’t really believe I’m typing that sentence.', '72 min: Double substitution for Manchester City Kevin De Bruyne and James McAtee replace Omar Marmoush, who found the intensity of the game too much at this stage of his education, and Phil Foden.', '71 min Odegaard is booked for dissent after being penalised for a challenge on Kovacic just outside the City area.', '68 min Rice, who has been fabulous, leads a three-on-three break and plays the ball through to Martinelli in the inside-right channel. He smashes a shot across goal that is pushed away by the diving Ortega. That’s a good save, although maybe Rice’s pass pushed Martinelli slightly wide.', 'Moments later Bernardo Silva – as bad a loser as he is good a player – has a little kick at the prostrate Trossard. It wasn’t strong enough for VAR to get involved.', '66 min “Has my palate become jaded after all these years, or is this top-of-the-table clash a bad cover version of a face-off?” says Paul Griffin. “Having the magic of Duran Duran’s Public Enemy cover, Miley Cyrus’s Smells Like Teen Spirit?, or EinsturzendeNeubauten’s cover of The Wurzels ‘I am a cider drinker’ than the originals?”', 'Not even Johnny Cash could improve on this original.', 'A spine-tingling moment at the Emirates. The teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, whose world seemed to have collapsed eight days ago, has scored his first goal in senior football to give Arsenal a 3-1 lead.', 'Declan Rice, on the left, played a terrific, sharp pass into Lewis-Skelly on the edge of the area. He took it beautifully on the half turn, moved away from Stones and curled a right-footed shot that went through the left hand of the diving Ortega.', 'Maybe Ortega should have done better, but that’s the most incredible moment for Lewis-Skelly, an 18-year-old who was booked in the return fixture before he had played a minute of senior football – and who was asked, rhetorically, “who the eff are you?” by Erling Haaland.', 'Nothing stirs the soul of a football fan quite like watching young players write their own fairytales; Arsenal fans in the ground will remember that moment forever.', 'Who the eff are you?', '61 min A side-angle replay shows that Foden had a clear view; Foden was trying to sweep a pass into Marmoush but undercooked it badly.', '59 min That was a weirdly poor pass from Foden. Gary Neville is speculating that his view of Partey might have been obscured by the referee. I’ve no idea, but I do know this game has exploded into life. Gvardiol finds Marmoush on the left side of the area; his first-time cross is crucually cut out by the sliding Gabriel.']"

Erling Haaland scored. For 105 glorious seconds it seemed like that would decide the game, the result and the narrative. It would be the difference between Arsenal, who failed to build on and take advantage of their lead, and the champions, who now had the momentum.', 'But as has been Manchester City’s problem all season, the idea of what they will do next was based on an increasingly irrelevant past.', 'When their atrocious run of form started it was just assumed that Pep Guardiola “would figure it out” or “turn things around”, with no actual explanation as to how. Many simply suspected a typically indifferent start to the season would be followed by a characteristic post-Christmas march into trophy-winning form. Upon realising that would not come to pass, the wider belief was that any and all issues would be rectified with a considerable January spend.', 'But there are no quick fixes to problems so fundamental, nor was there a rousing, swashbuckling victory from behind. Another mistake led to another Arsenal goal and the hosts never looked back, having all eight of the game’s shots after Haaland’s equaliser.', 'Seven minutes after parity was restored, Manchester City were 3-1 down. Ten or so later and Havertz rendered all the thoughts and hot takes on the preceding hour and a quarter entirely moot with a stunningly composed finish. Arsenal only briefly stopped oléing to celebrate Ethan Nwaneri’s outstanding stoppage-time goal, with perhaps a couple of moments set aside to pinch their collective selves.', 'Arsenal have crushed teams before and Manchester City have capitulated in a great many second halves of late; it was still unfathomable for both to happen in the same game, so foreboding is the crisis-adjacent cloud constantly hovering over the Gunners.', 'Their transfer frustration is understandable but this is a remarkable team, especially so when the pieces fall into place in unison. With Gabriel and Declan Rice as peerless battle-winners, David Raya pulling off excellent stops, Havertz knitting attacks together and every other player fulfilling their roles brilliantly it is difficult to see where improvements can be easily made without upsetting the balance.', 'The obvious position is at centre-forward and that argument was somehow strengthened by Havertz making the most efficient goalscoring decision possible when he squared for Martin Odegaard to shoot into an empty net after a ferocious press forced Manuel Akanji’s mistake. One man’s tell-tale sign of a player lacking confidence or that cutting edge is another’s very good assist.', 'But then Havertz skewed his later effort wide from another Manchester City error in possession and it felt as though whatever else happened in this game wouldn’t actually matter. That was The Chance, the opportunity to put an opponent down, take a 2-0 lead in the 26th minute and win by a ridiculous scoreline like 5-1 or something.

It’s a special character. He can play in three positions basically, as a left back, as a No.6, as a No.8, he’s very versatile. He has some unbelievable questions every time you ask him to do something, and he has the competitive edge which I think is demanded at this level. And he really wants it, so we are going to use him in different positions.”', 'Not enough is made of how well Lewis-Skelly has been integrated, nor really the ease with which he has stepped up. That was a masterful display from precisely the sort of player Manchester City might have sold on the pretence his path to the first team was blocked.', 'But the biggest transfer disparity between these two teams lies in Havertz and Haaland, the opposing philosophies of an attacking focal point who wants to get involved and a striker who only operates across the width of the posts.

Planning this side of our game meticulously, Arteta and his players executed the press superbly, and with tremendous courage.', 'Below you can see how Pep Guardiola stationed five players near the halfway line when playing out from deep, but we backed ourselves to handle that 5v5. Our second-minute opener owed much to the way we manufactured a 4v3 overload thanks to the angles we used when closing down defenders. Laying a trap that forced John Stones to pass square to Manuel Akanji (who was deliberately pressed late and aggressively by Leandro Trossard) was an idea that worked brilliantly:', '', 'Kai Havertz could have scored midway through the first half from another excellent, coordinated press. Blocking off all other passing lanes to create a 4v3, keeper Stefan Ortega was forced to make a straight pass into Mateo Kovacic, and Declan Rice was one step ahead, reading it and then making a clean tackle to set up the German.', '', 'Thomas Partey’s crucial goal, less than a minute after the visitors had equalised, was a hugely critical moment that also stemmed from a high turnover. Intercepting a risky Phil Foden pass, the Ghanaian’s deflected strike proved to be the springboard for our grandstand finish.', 'It was the first time on record (since 2010/11) that Arsenal had scored 3+ goals from high turnovers in a match - and it was also the first time City had conceded that many from those situations in a single game. This graphic shows where we picked them off on 11 occasions:', '', 'Sitting in a mid-to-low block for large periods of this clash, it was evident that breakaways were going to be an important weapon, and so it proved during a stunning second-half display.', 'Havertz’s outstanding fourth goal means we have now found the back of the net with a third of our ‘fast breaks’ this season, five from 15. Partey unlocked the potential for a counter by easing past Kevin de Bruyne in the build-up to the strike, and his early pass to release Gabriel Martinelli set us on our way. As shown below, this piece of play took six or seven Manchester City players out of the game:', '', 'Over the course of this match, six of our 17 transitions reached the City penalty area, with a storming run from Rice to set up Martinelli for a shot, one of several other highlights. We were very good at exposing our opponents from those turnover situations:', '', 'One key reason why we hurt Guardiola’s side in those moments was our superior athleticism, especially down the spine of the pitch. From back to front there was a desire to push ourselves physically, and that is highlighted in this table showing the individuals who made 270 or more intensive runs:', ' ', '', 'He wasn’t especially busy, but David Raya delivered for his teammates on two vital occasions. During a period where we had invited pressure in and around our box, the Spaniard produced a couple of fabulous reaction saves.', 'The first from Josko Gvardiol’s header showcased his sharp reflexes, and he also responded in lightning-quick fashion to keep out a deflected Savinho shot from close range.', 'Those key contributions should not be overlooked when assessing this victory.', 'This was a win that will live long in the memory for a variety of reasons, but one beautiful narrative is that it was a night of priceless importance to the Arsenal academy. To see recent graduates Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri both score and play with colossal degrees of confidence, can only act as an inspiration to the next generation of players who are developing at Hale End.', 'Lewis-Skelly was phenomenal all game long, winning eight of his nine duels, and performing with incredible composure and belief. Twice he outmuscled Haaland, and he only misplaced two passes overall.', ""Myles Lewis-Skelly's passes and shots"", '', 'Nwaneri came off the bench on 84 minutes and made an instant impact, running at the beleaguered City defence every time he had an opportunity. His now trademark left-foot curler into the far corner was an exquisite finish that came on the end of a sequence of 36 passes which involved every outfield home player, lasting one minute 54 seconds.', 'It was the longest passing move leading to a Premier League goal since September 2023, and this amazing graphic illustrates the move in all its glory:', '', 'It was an outrageously good switch pass from Rice that set up Nwaneri for that goal, and over the course of this pulsating affair, I felt the midfielder was our main man.', '', 'Exemplifying the fire we had in our bellies, Rice produced a barnstorming central midfield display that was dripping in power and quality. It was his neat pass into Lewis-Skelly that set up our third goal; his instinctive cushioned pass from Leandro Trossard’s turnover slipped Havertz into the box ahead of our opener; and it was his perfectly timed challenge on Mateo Kovacic that gave our striker a gilt-edged chance to score midway through the first period too.', 'He did all that and more, while also providing a solid screen in front of our back four alongside Partey. While it was not down to Rice alone of course, the fact that Haaland enjoyed just 10 touches in the match owed plenty to the diligent work our England international put in to help us keep our shape.', ' ', 'Ultimately this was a great team performance, with everybody playing with fight, spirit, energy and intelligence to pull off a famous win, but Rice’s leadership and decision-making at key junctures was exceptional as he stood tall in this high-stakes clash.

Why Arsenal vs Man City is the Premier League’s most bitter rivalry,https://www.the-independent.com/sport/football/arsenal-man-city-fixture-preview-b2689419.html,"['', 'Amid ownership rivalries off the pitch and fading trophy ambitions on it, Arsenal and Manchester City clash again at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday', '', '', ""From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging."", '', '', 'If the Arsenal and Manchester City squads are readying themselves for “war” on Sunday, the mood isn’t that different off the pitch. There are few polite niceties there. This is probably the club relationship with the deepest animosity in the Premier League, and even worse than some notorious rivalries from the past.', 'September’s 2-2 draw had more fallout than any other match this season so far, and that’s despite this campaign’s many refereeing controversies. One official at a rival club even marvelled at how the fallout had gone into “day six”. That 2-2 had opprobrium about referees and much more, including a farrago over footage of Arsenal executive vice-chair Tim Lewis leaving his seat without shaking hands with City counterparts. There was some irritation about that in north London, especially since they feel City’s senior figures don’t always welcome them.', 'The champions, meanwhile, see Arsenal as one of the clubs most actively in opposition to their ownership. Crucially, some of this has filtered down to the dressing rooms.', 'Antipathy is so strong that, when details came out about City Football Group pursuing Arsenal target Sverre Halseth Nypan through its Spanish club, Girona, some around the Emirates suspected it was just to drive up their price. Girona’s interest was nevertheless genuine.', 'As petty as some of that sounds, recruitment forms a central theme ahead of this match, fittingly coming just before deadline day. That’s both in terms of where the teams are and what recruitment represents.', 'It should be stressed that key figures at Arsenal, including Lewis, outright believe that states or state-linked figures shouldn’t own football clubs, as is the case with Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour. Others in the game fairly say the same should apply to billionaires like Stan Kroenke. There is nevertheless another dimension to that, given how people in the Premier League see Arsenal as essentially leading a group of American ownerships in pushing the stance that sporting competition can’t work properly if it includes state-linked ownership. The argument is that you are ultimately dealing with a greater level of power, which is almost impossible to regulate.', 'Sources close to the top of the Premier League say that this is a split that has become increasingly apparent over the last two years, amid wider developments in global football and the announcement of the Premier League charges against City in 2023. This is in some ways the future of football: the US against the Gulf. Such dynamics give City more ground for complaints that other clubs target them, even if it isn’t “a cartel”. The Premier League was duty-bound to investigate the 2018 Football Leaks that precipitated these charges. What is perhaps more relevant is how some clubs would push for the strongest possible punishment if guilt is proven. Or, as Pep Guardiola put it, for City to be “wiped off the face of the Earth”. The champions are meanwhile part of their own voting bloc, which includes Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest.', 'This runs deeper. People at Arsenal still talk bitterly about how their club was the first big victim of “the sportswashing era”. Arsene Wenger coined “financial doping” amid a period where City signed a series of Arsenal’s best players. Some players on Sunday would gladly emulate Emmanuel Adebayor’s notorious celebration from September 2009, especially after the bad blood of the 2-2 earlier this season. Those at the Etihad meanwhile talk of how they were instantly made to feel like outsiders at Uefa meetings after the 2008 takeovers.', 'Even the arguments about state-linked ownership, however, ultimately settle on clubs’ ability to compete – which comes back to the market. City figures would willingly point to how much Arsenal have spent on transfer fees, such as their signing of Declan Rice. Those at the Emirates Stadium state their wage bill is still much lower. For the 2023-24 season, where Mikel Arteta’s team lost the league by two points, his squad’s wage bill was around £318m compared to City’s £400m.', 'There also remains resentment about Arteta’s move from City to Arsenal in December 2019. The Etihad hierarchy have never been happy with how that process went. Arsenal subsequently found extreme resistance to Arteta’s attempt to bring over two staff members, including set-piece specialist Nicolas Jover. That same staff, meanwhile, have long noted how Guardiola and his team don’t quite “pat them on the head” like they used to.', 'All this further fires the emotion around the game, as well as – crucially – the different positions of the clubs.', 'One of the reasons there has been such frustration at Arsenal is because there had been such focus on finally besting City. It even influenced recruitment decisions, like having a more robust midfield. Instead, a series of factors have combined to ensure Arteta’s team are off where they were last season, but in a campaign where City have fallen off. That has created this angst, as Arsenal are aware they will be criticised if Liverpool effectively leapfrog them to the title.', ""That awareness is also driving a message to keep calm and look at the bigger picture. Arsenal feel that years of recruitment planning has put them in a place where they are only a few details away from having an elite team for half a decade. They do want a forward in this window, having enquired about Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, with a big push ongoing for Bayern Munich's Mathys Tel. That is nevertheless measured against an insistence on ensuring any signing is in keeping with that more calculated long-term planning. The ideal player up front is Benjamin Sesko, but Leipzig’s Champions League chase means it would cost an extra £50m to get him now rather than in the summer."", 'That could impinge plans to “complete” the squad by bringing in Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi, a Sesko-style striker and a wide forward such as Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, who Arsenal greatly admire. The danger is of course in constantly looking to the future.', 'City, after years of being so well run, could meanwhile be criticised for not looking to the future enough. This January’s business feels like a belated squad overhaul that was long needed. Guardiola’s Champions League-winning side had gone stale. Other clubs have still been a bit baffled by some of the business, as well as Erling Haaland’s new contract, especially as regards what they mean for the hearing.', 'They probably don’t mean anything, given that nobody yet knows how it will conclude. All anyone outside the hearing can really say is that it is known to have been a “very disciplined” process so far. City’s business can even be interpreted in terms of both main potential outcomes. If they are cleared, there is no issue with expenditure. If they are found guilty and heavily punished, they’ve already future-proofed the squad.', 'More immediately, they now have a squad with more depth and pace for Sunday, and probably more than Arsenal given the injuries. Against that, however, Arteta’s side look far more defensively robust than a porous City. The latter have a profound fragility that is there to be exploited. Even Brugge did it. City also have that sense of superiority that comes from being repeat champions. That is what Arsenal want. That is why Arsenal took solace in “rattling” them after that 2-2. Both are in each other’s heads. Neither, however, are in top spot.', ""The Premier League’s most acrimonious rivalry has suddenly become a subplot in a larger story. Given football's modern geopolitics, though, that isn’t just about chasing down Liverpool."", 'Arsenal vs Manchester City kicks off at 4.30pm, coverage is on Sky Sports', 'Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies', '']"

The German goalkeeper was spared by his compatriot Havertz, for whom the presence of Stones on the line was scant excuse.', 'City worked their way back into the contest and smoothly controlled the action in the early stages of the second period, culminating in Haaland silencing the Emirates when he nodded home a cross from Savinho, who beautifully received a pass from Foden.', ""However, another error undid the hard work Guardiola's side had put in. Foden's wretched pass showed why a player of his obvious gifts is not trusted to play deeper in a City midfield that could use his legs. Partey read it like a book and his shot looped off Stones into the net."", 'If hard work got City to 1-1, the sense of them downing tools against a team with more ideas, more hunger and more vibrancy in the final half-hour was startling to behold. Lewis Skelly once again marked himself out as a youngster destined for great things.', 'The finishes inside the final 15 minutes from Havertz and Nwaneri were brilliant and City let Arsenal be brilliant.

If we get one, of course. ', ""City into Arsenal territory but they're met with a red wall for one last time in the half.

Either side of the incident where Arsenal should have got 2-0 up, the hosts had David Raya to thank for preserving their lead. His save to deny Gvardiol from Marmoush's left-wing corner was outstanding and there was more smart work to keep out a deflected Savinho shot shortly before the break."", '45 mins: A more routine piece of work for Raya, who pouches the ball after Kovacic bashes a volley into the turf.', ""44 mins: Another fine stop from Raya! Nunes overhits his cross but it comes to Savinho, who's shit takes a nick off Saliba and the Arsenal goalkeeper adjusts well to keep it out at his near post."", '42 mins: Gvardiol drives a volley cross the box and Gabriel has to take evasive action.

Barely half a chance, in fairness.', '23 mins: INCREDIBLE SAVE FROM RAYA! Marmoush whipped the ball in hard and flat, Gvardiol met it well and Raya touched it up and against his far post.

Guardiola's men are yet to muster a shot."", '10 mins: Things have settled down a bit, with Havertz needlessly caught offside just after Nunes was for City.', ""6 mins: Arsenal have the ball in the net again as Martinelli dinks Odegaard's delicate pass into the net. But the Brazil winger went too soon and is offside."", '2 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!! Martin Odegaard!!!!!', 'A gift for Arsenal and Odegaard makes no mistake.

', ""15 mins before kickoff: So where's your money then? Arsenal's defensive solidity and set-piece threat should win the day, you feel. That might sound dull but it's a hard reality that City, despite only losing once in their past nine games, remain flimsy. For all their lack of attacking cutting edge without Bukayo Saka, Arsenal aren't. Foden, Marmoush and Savinho all starting could be exciting from a City point of view, but Rice and Partey will fancy running over their midfield."", '45 mins before kickoff: So, Ederson is laid low by a ""minor injury"" according to Guardiola. With Leyton Orient up next in the FA Cup, you\'d think the target for the Brazil international now is the first leg of City\'s Champions League playoff showdown with Real Madrid on February 12. Ortega is as good a No, 2 as there is in England\'s top flight and started eight out of nine games between the start of December and mid-January.

Will City need similar heroics today?', '', '1 hr 10 mins before kickoff: The big boost for Arsenal is David Raya being passed fit to start in between the posts.

Phil Foden, Omar Marmoush, Savinho and Erling Haaland all start, with Matheus Nunes and Josko Gvardiol expected to bomb forward from full-back. Stefan Ortega starts in goal, with Ederson absent from the matchday squad. The Brazilian's range of passing from deep was vital during last weekend's win over Chelsea."", ""1 hr 25 mins before kickoff: Confirmed team news will be with us in 10 minutes and Pep Guardiola will once again attempt to squad the circle that is his midfield without Rodri. The Ballon d'Or winner suffered an ACL injury against Arsenal in that September clash and, although City's flailing title defence has had multiple issues, it all comes back to this one,.They have not yet accounted for the Spain star's absence in the transfer window and fans are hoping for a successful deadline day so far as links to Porto's former Barcelona youngster Nico Gonzalez are concerned.

Good Football Men everywhere purred with approval. The City vs. Liverpool matches in the Guardiola-Klopp era were great, but it was all too nice. This had needle, or so the argument went. In the interim period, Liverpool have continued to be very nice indeed and are in a very strong position at the top of the table.

But what followed was a disastrous 20-minute period for the defending champion, during which Arsenal scored three goals – the first just moments after the Norwegian’s equalizer – as the host took complete control of the game.', '“I only regret the last 25 minutes, we forgot to do what we should do, what we have done for 65, 70 minutes,” Guardiola told reporters, adding: “It’s happened all season – we are giving away too many things. We are aware this cannot happen.”', 'According to Opta, it was the fourth time that City has conceded four or more goals this season, the most in a single campaign over the course of Guardiola’s managerial career.', 'Arsenal, looking to keep the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table, got off to a fast start when Manuel Akanji was dispossessed close to the Manchester City goal, allowing Kai Havertz to tee up Martin Ødegaard for the game’s first goal inside two minutes.', 'David Raya was forced to make a spectacular save onto the crossbar from Joško Gvardiol’s header as City looked for a response, while Havertz also spurned a glorious chance in front of goal to extend Arsenal’s lead.', 'The home side led at halftime, but a brilliant cross from Savinho was converted by Haaland – the forward’s 19th league goal of the season – to level the match in the 55th minute.', 'City’s relief was only short-lived, however, as Thomas Partey intercepted a pass and, thanks to a heavy deflection off John Stones, restored Arsenal’s advantage only 38 seconds after the Citizens had leveled.', 'That proved to be the beginning of City’s undoing. Myles Lewis-Skelly made it 3-1 when he drove into the penalty area and fired a shot past Stefan Ortega for the first goal of his Arsenal career. Giving a heightened sense of drama to the occasion, the 18-year-old marked the goal by mimicking Haaland’s celebration – sitting cross-legged and closing his eyes as if meditating.', 'Havertz then made amends for his earlier miss when he finished off a counterattack, and the home side completed the rout in stoppage time when another teenager, 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, scored with the final act of the game.', 'Arsenal, having played one more match than Liverpool, is now six points behind its rival in the Premier League title race.

Arsenal humble Manchester City: Myles Lewis-Skelly signals a new era in dominant 5-1 win at the Emirates,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/arsenal-humble-manchester-city-myles-lewis-skelly-signals-a-new-era-in-dominant-5-1-win-at-the-emirates/,"['', 'LONDON -- A true humbling not seen since ""Not Like Us,"" this was the last act missing in Arsenal\'s case for greatness. Here was a swaggering display of superiority from Mikel Arteta\'s men against the team that has been their benchmark -- through remote, their revival. There might not be enough time for Arsenal to claim Premier League supremacy this season but putting their rival out for the count like this is a sign of the greatness to come.', ""A celebration shouldn't define a performance like this, a moment for the crowd that would usually be no more meaningful to the final score than the pre-match fireworks. And yet when Myles Lewis-Skelly aped Erling Haaland's celebration with brazen self-confidence, it was apparent that something had changed for Arsenal. There was nothing to fear from their tormentors. There was nothing Manchester City could throw at them that they could not deal with. In an instant, they realized they were much the better team. Cue the Kendrick. "", ""They had beaten City before and they will probably beat City again. Those past triumphs, even those brave defeats and the draws that might have been something more, were markers on the journey to equalling the champions. Arsenal still looked up to City, set them as the standard. No more. They are now perfectly prepared to clown on the champions. Gabriel will celebrate in Haaland's face because he does not fear the reprisals. The home crowd will serenade City's big man in the most robust of terms."", ""To get there, all Arsenal needed to was believe. For much of the first hour, Arsenal were nothing to write home about. The press had caused trouble in the City backline; Manuel Akanji robbed in possession for Martin Odegaard to score the first, Mateo Kovacic's pocket picked before Kai Havertz blazed wide in what seemed like the moment Arsenal blew it. The backline held firm too, giving their opponents all the possession they might need without allowing much beyond a smattering of half chances. "", ""Between that, not a lot. Arsenal weren't building through possession. They were a little too prepared to sacrifice the area in front of their box, to bait the long shot and keep the ball away from Haaland."", ""It was as if they had imbued the wrong messages from the last time they'd met City. The ferocious defense of a 2-1 lead by 10 men until the death at the Etihad might have been Arsenal's best performance of the season before today. The faith it generated in the rearguard has occasionally veered into the blind since. Often they have gotten themselves a goal to the good and declared from there. If any defense in England can hold onto such a lead it is one anchored by Gabriel and William Saliba. Still, there comes a time when sitting deep is too much of a gamble, even against this approximation of City."", ""They only needed to click once. And so they did, Savinho drifting from left to right, taking Phil Foden's cross for Haaland to head home. Arsenal had been playing as they would and should against the City of last season and the one before, trusting their defense to keep the big guy quiet at one end and backing themselves to nick it at the other. Not this time. They were simply a lot better."", 'Arteta would insist otherwise. Asked to reflect on an impressive display by David Raya, the Arsenal manager was at pains to point to the two first-half saves his goalkeeper made. ""', 'A lot of things have to go your way, and in those moments you have to be very efficient, you need a bit of luck, you need an individual action, we had it all today. That\'s why the result reflects that distance because a lot of things go our way today.""', 'That may well be the case but superior personnel tend to create their own fortune. That is what Arsenal had today. Whether behind his midfield or in front of it, Odegaard could find all the space he needed. Declan Rice had enforced his will on Bernardo Silva, whose most significant contributions to this game were a string of niggly off-ball challenges. Most of all, Lewis-Skelly had approached this contest with a total absence of trepidation. ', 'Every time he went into a challenge it was full-throated, the prelude to him driving out of danger. Press him and Lewis-Skelly was drawing a foul. His ability to do that is remarkable. The top 10 players in the Premier League for fouls drawn per 90 minutes are, well, the sort you might expect. Tricky wingers, ball-dominant midfielders. Them and Lewis-Skelly, who ranks sixth with an average of nearly three. Having already baited Haaland and Foden, his tail was up. ', 'Right, into these, he seemed to say when the ball came to him from Declan Rice. Straight at John Stones, there was only one thing in his mind. He was going straight at goal. ""I wasn\'t expecting it,"" joked Arteta. ""I was talking with one of our staff members today about that, that he needs to threaten more in the final third when he gets in this position.""', 'The goal itself was a moment of dizzying talent, as good a first shot as you will see in senior football. Lewis-Skelly\'s response made you wonder if he\'d been waiting for this day before letting fly. As tempers flared back in September, the 18-year-old had drawn the wrath of Haaland. ""Who the f--- are you?"" City\'s No. 9 seemed to say after a final whistle in which he was at pains to tell Arteta to ""stay humble.""', ""If Haaland didn't know Lewis-Skelly's name then, he does now. He was the one meditating after Arsenal's third."", '""He\'s got [tenacity] inside him,"" Arteta said of his young left back. ""He feels it and he\'s very good at expressing it as well, and some players struggle with that. He does it in every action, he does it with his body language, he does it with his facial expression, how he lives the game, and then with the ball, because he takes it. ', '""He wants to make things happen, he takes risks, he takes initiative, and at his age, that\'s not easy to see.""', 'He was not the only Hale End graduate intent on making things happen. Ethan Nwaneri put a bow on this remarkable triumph with a magnificent bending strike beyond Stefan Ortega. He had come onto the pitch with the air of a young man utterly convinced he was going to do something just as special as Lewis-Skelly.', ""The youngsters' belief was infectious. From 3-1 up onwards, Gabriel was calling for the ball any chance he got. He fancied getting in on the act. Flicking the ball up for a bicycle kick, he very nearly did. Jurrien Timber tried to turn one in from no angle at all at the near post. They all wanted in on the act. Why shouldn't they? Who was stopping them?"", ""There's levels to this.

Waka Waka was another, so the many thousands of home fans could launch into their chant to that tune in celebration of Kai Havertz. And then there was Humble by Kendrick Lamar, and there was only one person that one was aimed at.', '', 'Historically, this fixture hasn’t been especially interesting: until last season, it was incredibly one-sided, City having not lost to Arsenal in the league since Pep Guardiola arrived in Manchester in summer 2016. As such, you’d struggle to really call it a rivalry, particularly when there was also so little ‘needle’ between the teams.', 'That seems to have changed this season — and with some gusto. In the first league game between them in September, there was antipathy aplenty, culminating in Erling Haaland bopping Gabriel on the head with the ball after John Stones scored a late equaliser, then Haaland asking teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly (making his senior debut that day) “Who the f*** are you?” and urging Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta to “stay humble” at full time.', 'So Arsenal pumping that Lamar song out over the speakers yesterday was petty, liable to blow up in their face at some point and probably not the sort of banter that a slick and shiny modern football corporation should be indulging in. Or, to put it another way, it was absolutely excellent and exactly the sort of thing we neutrals like to see.', 'Haaland seems to be at the centre of it all, his running battle with old foe Gabriel (which also featured him pointing to the gold Premier League badge on his shirtsleeve, denoting City’s status as champions) being a significant feature of the game.', 'You could argue it’s a bad thing for Arsenal to be rattled to this extent by some relatively gentle chiding from Haaland, but if that was the fuel they used to motivate them to this victory, then it’s difficult to fault how they’ve used it. The fact they have Lewis-Skelly, a kid who is not just a brilliantly promising footballer but also seemingly not intimidated by anything around him, is even more encouraging for those of us who would like this to become a rivalry with genuine spite to it.', 'We might not be in ‘Arsenal vs Manchester United in the 1990s/early 2000s’ territory here, and it would have been nice if this level of spite had been around when the teams were fighting for the title, but this sort of edge makes you look forward to their next meeting even more.', 'With Manchester United at the moment, it feels like they’re constantly taking one step forward, then one step back, with that step back somehow meaning they fall into a giant vat of sewage.', 'Their problems have been around way longer than Ruben Amorim has, but with every home defeat you’re less and less convinced the man named their head coach in November is actually helping to change them.', '', 'United have lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and, yesterday, Crystal Palace at Old Trafford since he arrived; that awkward silence at the end of defeats as their fans try to process what they’ve just seen becoming more and more frequent. The only club to have lost more Premier League home matches than United (13) since the start of last season are Wolverhampton Wanderers, with 16. Which is not brilliant company.', 'It’s especially odd considering the number of strong performances they have put in on the road. Beating Manchester City, drawing with Liverpool, getting past Arsenal on penalties in the FA Cup, digging out a fairly ugly 1-0 win at Fulham: all of these should be signs of encouragement, indications that things are heading in the right direction.', 'But then they go back home and it all seems to collapse. And with every defeat, the impression that Amorim is regretting his decision to move to Manchester from Lisbon’s Sporting CP in the middle of the season gets stronger.', 'Playing Kobbie Mainoo as a false nine against Palace felt like less a tactical choice and more a cry for help, but was also pretty symbolic of their problems: here is a talented and promising midfielder pressed into action in an unfamiliar position, while two strikers on whom they’ve spent about £100million ($123m) in the past 18 months, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, sit on the bench until the 70th minute. And the player who was supposed to be their future, the centrepiece of United for a generation and the latest great to emerge from their vaunted youth system, Marcus Rashford, is off on loan to Aston Villa, relationship with his boyhood club in tatters.', '', 'Maybe we shouldn’t have too much sympathy for Amorim: he knew what he was getting himself in for; and if he didn’t, that’s on him.', 'But maybe this is an impossible job now, a combination of expensive but sub-standard talent and structural problems that still haven’t been convincingly addressed, coalescing into the mess we see in front of us.', 'Whatever it is, Amorim looks lost at the moment.', 'GO DEEPER', ""Mainoo as a false nine? A strange experiment that highlighted Man Utd's flaws"", 'It’s tempting to be sniffy about transfer deadline day, to write it off as a media-driven sideshow that overpowers the actual football. But it can also be hugely entertaining, and most of us will be tuning in to see who moves where before 11pm (6pm ET) tonight.', 'The question, with this particular window’s deadline day falling on the Monday after a weekend of fixtures, is whether anything that happened during those 10 games will change how the Premier League’s 20 clubs will go about these potentially frantic last few hours?', 'GO DEEPER', 'What deadline-day transfers could still happen before the winter window shuts?', 'It won’t be startling to Manchester City that there’s a big, Rodri-shaped hole in their midfield, but could the 5-1 defeat by Arsenal yesterday be definitive proof they can’t just muddle through until the Spaniard recovers from his long-term knee injury? Are they at the point where they can’t be especially picky about who their replacement No 6 might be? Will this loss force them to make a move for someone such as Douglas Luiz of Juventus, who is a former City player, or Porto’s Nico Gonzalez?', '', 'What about neighbours United? The need for a forward of some description is obvious, but then again after watching them fold limply at home against Palace, their need for players in most positions might look quite pressing.', 'Eddie Howe hasn’t sounded especially positive about Newcastle’s chances of bringing anyone in before the window shuts, but will that have to change after two home defeats in a row against Bournemouth and Fulham?', 'Will one of the strugglers, particularly Leicester City or Ipswich Town, look for a Hail Mary signing following damaging defeats against theoretical relegation-scrap rivals in Everton and Southampton respectively?', '', 'On the flip side, Nottingham Forest are usually good for a slightly random last-minute signing, but there’s nothing like a 7-0 home win to make you think that, actually, the players you already have are enough. Equally Everton: will Beto’s two goals on Saturday convince them they don’t need another striker, and to stand pat? Might Arsenal think the same after sticking five past champions City?', 'Deadline day will surely present its fair share of silliness, but you wonder how different that would have been had the window closed back on Friday.', 'GO DEEPER', 'The anatomy of a transfer - as told by those who make a deal happen', '(Top photos: Getty Images)', 'Nick Miller is a football writer for the Athletic and the Totally Football Show.

The City manager acknowledged their standards had dropped after Thomas Partey restored Arsenal’s lead following a loose pass from Phil Foden.', '“The feeling is why we have not done in the last 20, 25 minutes what we had done well for the first 60,” Guardiola said. “Now we have to reflect and talk with the players and hope that it doesn’t happen again.”', 'Asked whether their second‑half collapse was due to his squad’s fragile confidence after a season in which City have lost seven Premier League games, he said: “It can be fragile because it happens so many times. But we have a duty to learn and there are always margins to get better. It’s happened all season, we are giving away too many things, we are aware this cannot happen, it happened.”', 'John Stones was at fault for Arsenal’s first two goals and he apologised to the City fans for the team’s performance in the final half‑hour. “It is hard to put into words straight after a game like that. Pride hurts. Sorry to the fans that have travelled to come and watch that,” he said. “How we played in the last 30 minutes was not acceptable. Personally and collectively, it’s not us.', '“It is not nice to be involved in that when you know it’s not your team in those situations. We were in the game and it was a swinging point. It swung the wrong way for us. I am angry, upset personally and collectively about how the game finished. There are a lot of different things that I still haven’t figured out as to why it hasn’t clicked. The heart’s there, the passion’s there; everyone’s got the right intention. We all need to stick together.”', 'Arteta was understandably delighted with the performance and result as Arsenal made it five matches without defeat against City. “It’s a great day for us – for the result and the manner that we did it,” he said. “We were very aggressive and we played with a lot of courage.”', 'Sign up to Football Daily', ""Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football"", '', 'The Arsenal manager also said that he had been surprised by Myles Lewis-Skelly’s first senior goal that the 18-year-old celebrated by performing the “Zen” celebration usually favoured by Haaland.', '“I wasn’t expecting it,” he said. “He’s got it inside him, he feels it and he’s very good at expressing it as well, and some players struggle with that. He does it in every action, he does it with his body language, he does it with his facial expression, how he lives the game, and then with the ball, because he takes it and he wants to make things happen, he takes risks, he takes initiative, and at his age that’s not easy to see.”', 'Asked about Lewis-Skelly’s celebration, Declan Rice said: “It’s football antics. Things happen on the pitch. He celebrated. It’s obviously the Haaland celebration. I know he has respect for him, the whole team has big respect for him because of what he’s done, he’s a big player.”']"

If you do the latter, you’ll keep on buying because your team didn’t finish top of the table so their must be something wrong with the team that needs fixing. A team doesn’t click on day 1 either, this is a gradual process that if managed well will get better and better the more games are played. There will also come a moment where the improvement will be massive to outsiders of the club but not a surprise at all to those within the club.', 'As there are quite a few clubs with big pockets in the Premier League the money factor has become a minor part of the winning formula in my opinion. Number 1 is the owner/board who sticks by their man when results aren’t going their way. Number 2 is the coach. He must not only be skilled in man management of his players but also in the not so visible part to the rest of us which is talking with the owner/board, outlining the long term plans and scouting for the right player and buying them for the right price. Paying through the nose just to get a player comes with a lot of risks, you don’t know if he’ll adapt to the team and the League. If he doesn’t, selling him again and getting back the money spend is almost impossible not to mention the time wasted and games lost trying to make the player tick.', 'In todays transfer market where 20 million pounds is considered a bargain there are many many many options for each position.

Other clubs with rich owners that have reached great heights albeit not consistently are for example Arsenal and Liverpool. ManU were the force to be reckoned with when Ferguson was the coach.

I’d like a suspension of the fair play rules for 5 years give or take and see what happens.
