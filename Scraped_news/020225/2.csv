An earnest defense of America's silliest holiday: Groundhog Day,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5282308/groundhog-day-weather-environment,"['By ', 'Avery Keatley', 'Punxsutawney Phil is held up by his handler for the crowd to see during the ceremonies for Groundhog day in 2018 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.', ""As a kid growing up in Pennsylvania, there are a few state treasures you come to revere, like Tastykake's Butterscotch Krimpets, a 64-pack of Crayola crayons with a sharpener on the back of the box, soft pretzels and Hershey's chocolate. But no locally-produced treat could touch the majesty of the state's ultimate icon: Punxsutawney Phil."", ""Groundhog Day always felt so exciting to me as a kid. Even though I grew up hundreds of miles from Punxsutawney, I remember approaching the holiday with the same bottled-up hope of a possible snow day. I always wished Phil would see his shadow and we'd be in for more snow, days spent outside on sleds and evenings indoors with hot chocolate. And for most of my childhood, Phil delivered, with predictions of long winters — though it took me a while, maybe longer than others, to realize his predictions didn't amount to much scientifically. But I still loved the suspense at the heart of the holiday, and the question: What will Punxsutawney Phil predict for the rest of the season?"", ""I'll be the first to admit that Groundhog Day is also a weird holiday (and some may quibble that it isn't a holiday at all). There's the pomp and circumstance, the top hats and tuxedos, and the myth that there is only one Punxsutawney Phil, who has been making weather predictions since the 1880s. And it definitely takes the cake for the holiday with the most rodent-themed merch. But for all its delightful strangeness, Groundhog Day is also a rarity among American holidays."", 'A family attends the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsutawney in 2007.', 'Take a look at an American cultural calendar, and you will find that the majority of our biggest holidays are in service to our national myth-making. We commemorate our independence from foreign power, and the emancipation of enslaved people. We remember our military achievements and fallen soldiers, and honor towering American figures like George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.', 'A number of cultures and religions leave their mark, too, with popular celebrations of Mardi Gras, Passover, Ramadan and Christmas dotting the year. But Groundhog Day is the only popular American holiday that explicitly celebrates our relationship with nature and reliance on the delicate balance of the seasons.', 'Though many Americans observe holidays that coincide with major seasonal shifts — Halloween and Diwali near the midpoint of autumn; Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa close to the winter solstice; Easter and Passover falling near the vernal equinox — we rarely celebrate them as such. Even the few civic holidays we have that are directly tied to nature do not draw our attention to the changing of seasons. Arbor Day passes with little fanfare or national attention. Earth Day feels less like a celebration and more like a yearly scolding about our carbon footprints. Thanksgiving serves mostly as an on-ramp to the pre-Christmas shopping season.', ""Around the table, Americans give thanks for worthy things like friends, family and health, but few count the food on the table and the earth that provided it among the things to give thanks for. And none of these holidays mark the seasonal shift in the earth's rotation around the sun."", 'Groundhog Day is different. Arriving roughly at midwinter, the seasonal halfway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, historians believe Groundhog Day has its origins in the pre-Christian Celtic celebration of Imbolc, later syncretized into Candlemas. Groundhog Day is a celebration of nature itself and our place in it. It invites us to participate in an ancient ritual, wondering if winter will continue, or if the thaw will come early, allowing us to start a new cycle of planting, growth and harvest.', ""Shifting seasons have been an important source of humankind's celebrations for millennia. Ancient Egyptians marked the winter solstice and the seasonal changes brought by the flood season. Nowruz, the new year celebration observed across Central Asia, has been celebrated on the spring equinox for more than 3,000 years. Some of our most ancient and mysterious megalithic sites, like the Nabta Playa stone circle and Stonehenge, point to the connection between our moving planet, the rhythms of the year and the lengths early humans would go to accurately predict them."", ""In our modern American lives, many of us sit a comfortable distance from the churn of seasons. Cars carry us around in movable indoor spaces, regardless of season; apartments and houses are equipped with electrical heating and cooling systems that shelter us from nature's harshest days. We've put more distance between the earth that yields our food and the well-lit stores where we obtain it. At the beginning of our national project, we were a people who staked our fortunes on the seasons: more than 90% of Americans were farmers. Today, that number is below 2%."", 'We also live in a time when the earth is changing rapidly, and the seasons in North America are shifting, too. Spring seems to arrive early, autumn late — the growing season for crops is shifting, and plagued by more severe extreme weather. Human life, plant life and animal life are intricately intertwined with the balance of seasons. The separation between our everyday lives and the change of seasons may make us comfortable, but it may also come at a cost.', 'Groundhog handler John Griffiths holds Punxsutawney Phil, who did not see his shadow, in 2020.', 'Groundhog Day can be a reminder of this delicate balance. It is a time of year when, if you are watching, the sky stays lighter later into the evening and the sun rises earlier in the morning.

This specific La Niña is quite weak, but we are still likely to see effects from it.', 'For the month of February, the national temperature outlook from the Climate Predication Center follows this trend.', '', 'The national precipitation outlook from the Climate Prediciton Center also follows suit.', 'Looking into the next 90 days the trend is likely to continue as dry and warm for the southern areas of the United States and a bit cooler and wet in northern portions.', 'Of course, southern Colorado weather weeks and months out is difficult to predict, but overall, it’s looking like the extended forecast for southern Colorado may be a bit drier and warmer than what we typically see as winter comes to an end and spring inches closer.', 'Copyright 2025 KKTV.

Groundhog Day was in two days, and one of the regulars was driving his RV out with his girlfriend, all the way to Gobbler’s Knob, to see Punxsutawney Phil emerge from his hibernal slumbers – to see him either release us into an early spring or condemn us to six more weeks of winter.', 'For non-American readers and the hopelessly out of touch, Groundhog Day is folk tradition that holds that groundhogs emerging from hibernation can predict the length of the remaining winter: if the groundhog does not see his shadow, spring will come early; if he does, we will have six more weeks of winter. The tradition purportedly came with the Pennsylvania Dutch when they fled religious persecution in Germany, where bears, badgers, and hedgehogs were variously held to predict the advent of spring. In America, the hedgehog was replaced by the groundhog – or, in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect of Southeastern Pennsylvania, the grundsow.', 'The first time my great-uncle let me fire his gun, he told me there is a season for everything, but I could always shoot groundhogs, anywhere, anytime. His Pennsylvania Dutch neighbors would occasionally ask him over as a favor, to do target practice on the podgy little mammals. The groundhog is hated, reviled, and killed for his produce-thieving, his tunnels, and his ankle-breaking holes. But one day of the year, he is adored.', 'Punxsutawney Phil, Groundhog Day, 2022, Pennsylvania. Photograph by Anthony Quintano. Creative Commons.', 'In 1886, The Groundhog Club of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, formalized the rite. They captured a wild groundhog (doubtless, like the medieval unicorn, through an act of terrible betrayal). After hunting groundhogs as pests throughout the year, on February 2 they would don top hats, rouse their special pampered hog, Punxsutawney Phil, from sleep, and hold him up to greet the sun.', 'The ceremony must have worked at least some social magic, because Punxsutawney went from a site of a minor folk tradition to the site of a national, if minor, holiday. Today, a crowd converges on Gobbler’s Knob every year, in RVs and trucks and cars, to party until dawn breaks and the men in top hats enact the ceremony. The celebration has an official beer sponsor (Sam Adams, which is insulting) and a motion picture (Bill Murray’s Groundhog Day, which is bleakly charming), surely the two ultimate proofs of having made it in America.', 'There are people who see in every popular celebration creeping paganism. Christmas is the major target, and while I can respect the fact that it takes real guts to protest such a universally beloved mass phenomenon, I think they’re wrong. With Groundhog Day, though, they might seem to have a case: After all, here’s a ritual where an animal predicts, if not causes, the weather. He both governs and personifies the ancient, endless turn from winter to spring. He is immortal – according to the Groundhog Club, the same Punxsutawney Phil has been predicting the advent of spring for almost two hundred years. And, in perhaps the most telling sign that we are dealing with a neopagan phenomenon, despite alleged links to medieval practices, the whole thing in its current form was started by men in the late 1880s who wanted an excuse to wear silly outfits.', 'But if the usual complaints about paganism hinge on the supposed pagan roots of Christian festal traditions, Groundhog Day goes in the other direction. Groundhog Day occurs on February Second every year because the animal weather lore involved was originally a Candlemas tradition.', 'So, what should we do with this looney Christian-derived, pagan-inflected, secular phenomenon? Must we eschew RVs and hot tubs, Gobbler’s Knob and top hats? Must we shun the hog?', 'Candlemas has lost the significance it once had; for most people Groundhog Day is all that’s left. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of Jesus at the Temple described in Luke 2. In the Liturgy of the Hours, the prophet Simeon’s words upon encountering Christ are repeated every night: “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared in the presence of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to thy people Israel.”', 'Some things fall into place when you know this. The groundhog is not a god, he is an image of the prophet, telling a people who have been walking in darkness what he has seen. The groundhog sees the coming of spring; Simeon sees the dawn breaking, the spring coming. Of course, there’s a difference: the groundhog’s vision is occluded – he sees his shadow not the sun – while the prophet he sees the light with his own eyes, a revelation and a glory that will bring about salvation. And the groundhog’s spring will inevitably be followed by another winter, while the prophet sees a new spring once and for all, for all mankind.', 'In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray’s punishment for being a cynical hedonist is to repeat the same day, over and over, without advancing to the next. His punishment is to experience the tragic futility of temporality, which Christianity and its promise of salvation makes irrelevant. No matter how stupid Murray’s character thinks Groundhog Day is, he has chosen to live within the groundhog’s world, and only escapes the cycle when he realizes this.', 'So, what should we do with this looney Christian-derived, pagan-inflected, secular phenomenon? Must we eschew RVs and hot tubs, Gobbler’s Knob and top hats? (We should certainly eschew Sam Adams for Pennsylvania’s own Yuengling). Must we shun the hog?', 'I think not.', 'Sometimes you doubtless have to cut down a sacred oak, but in my books it’s better to consecrate it. This is our Father’s world, not the demons’ or even the powers and principalities’; everything in it belongs to him.', 'I would simply restore Groundhog Day to its place as a Candlemas celebration. Medieval Europeans had their way of doing things, we Pennsylvanians have ours. Drive out to Gobbler’s Knob and party all night.
