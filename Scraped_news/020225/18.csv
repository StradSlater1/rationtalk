A better life is not necessarily tied to the physical space that you are in today,” Witkoff says in an interview with Fox News.', '“A better life is about better opportunity, better financial conditions, better aspirations for you and your family. That doesn’t occur because you get to pitch a tent in the Gaza Strip and you’re surrounded by 30,000 munitions that could go off at any moment,” Witkoff says.', '“The president is saying, ‘Let’s make it better for these people. Let’s give them more hope. Let them make that choice.’ And I think he’s right,” he adds.', 'Asked what message Trump is trying to send to the Middle East after the president declared that he wants the US to “own” Gaza, Witkoff responds, “He’s telling the Middle East that the last 50 years of doing things was not the correct way of doing things, and he’s going to change it up.', 'He “is telling the Middle East he wants to be transparent with the Palestinian people,” he says.', '“Gaza today is uninhabitable and will probably be uninhabitable for at least the next 10 to 15 years,” Witkoff adds.', 'Witkoff said earlier Tuesday that he will meet on Thursday with the prime minister of Qatar to discuss the ongoing hostage talks.', 'Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government supports a two-state solution in the Middle East, following US President Donald Trump’s shock announcement of plans to take over the Gaza Strip.', '“Australia’s position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year,” Albanese tells a news conference.', '“The Australian government supports on a bipartisan basis, a two-state solution.”', 'Republican Senator and Trump ally Lindsey Graham lightly pushes back against the US president’s plan for the US to take over Gaza.', '“I think that would be an interesting proposal.

If we could solve this problem without warfare, without all of the things that you’ve been witnessing over the last number of years, I think it would be a tremendous thing.”', 'Asked whether he’d back an Israeli strike on Iran, Trump responds, “We’ll have to see what happens.”', 'WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia reiterates its stance against normalizing relations with Israel before a two-state solution has been reached, after US President Donald Trump said earlier that Riyadh has not made the establishment of a Palestinian state a condition for a peace deal with Israel.', 'A statement from Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry says that the kingdom’s stance in favor of a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital is “firm and unwavering.”', 'It notes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated as much in a speech last September, when he said Riyadh would not establish ties with Israel without this main condition met.', 'The Saudi statement carefully doesn’t mention Trump by name, as Riyadh and other countries around the world try to avoid crossing the US president at the start of his second term.', 'However, Riyadh does stress that it had already conveyed its position against normalizing ties with Israel before a Palestinian state is established “to the previous US administration and the current administration.”', 'Non-Saudi officials and analysts alike, though, have long dismissed such statements from Riyadh, insisting that bin Salman is far more flexible on the issue in private and is only seeking the establishment of a “pathway” to Palestinian statehood before normalizing ties with Israel.', 'However, those same officials and analysts acknowledge that Riyadh has been seeking a much more irreversible pathway since the Gaza war, which has catapulted the Palestinian issue to the top of the international agenda.', 'Palestinian terror group Hamas is ready to establish contact and hold talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump, Russia’s RIA state news agency cites a senior Hamas official as saying.', '“We are ready for contact and talks with the Trump administration,” RIA cites senior Hamas Politburo member Mousa Abu Marzouk as saying.', '“In the past, we did not object to contacts with the administration of [former US president Joe] Biden, Trump or any other US administration, and we are open to talks with all international parties.”', 'It is not clear when RIA interviewed Marzouk, who was visiting Moscow yesterday for talks with the Russian foreign ministry.', 'Trump has vowed that the US will take over the war-shattered Gaza Strip after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and develop it economically, a move that would shatter decades of US policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.', 'Marzouk tells RIA that talks with the US have become a kind of necessity for Hamas, considering that Washington is a key player in the Middle East.', '“That is why we welcomed the talks with the Americans and have no objection to this issue,” he adds.', 'In response to questions at his joint press conference with US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu says he believes that “peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible; it’s going to happen.”', 'If Trump had had another half-year of his first term, it would already have happened, says the prime minister.', '“I’m committed to achieving it.

We’ll make sure that it’s done world class,” Trump continued.', 'Initially asked by Collins who he envisions living in Gaza, Trump said, “I envision the world people living there. The world’s people. I think you’ll make that into an international, unbelievable place. I think the potential and the Gaza Strip is unbelievable.

Susan Collins and Todd Young, GOP swing votes on the committee, said they were able to overcome their worries after being offered assurances about Gabbard’s position on Snowden.', '“I think we all understand that they can be under tremendous pressure, but this is our national security we’re talking about,” he said, later adding, “I think our national security should always come first, not political pressure and partisanship, especially on a vote like this when you see the way it came out. It’s unfortunate.”', 'Asked by CNN about Democrats getting rolled on nominations, after Trump’s controversial picks continue to advance, Sen. Mark Kelly responded, “This is a democracy. I do not agree with us getting rolled. You know, this is the way it works. There are consequences of elections.”', 'He noted that he and his Democratic colleagues voted not to approve Gabbard’s nomination, adding, “that’s not getting rolled.

The three-phased agreement has seen several hostages of the October 7, 2023 attack return home, with the rest slated to be released in the next phases.', 'President Donald Trump proposed the US taking over the Gaza Strip and assuming responsibility for reconstructing the war-torn territory during a press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu.', '“The US will take over the Gaza Strip. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.

Hamas militants released another three Israeli captives Thursday, as well as five Thai nationals, all of whom were taken to Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack. In exchange, Israel will release another 110 imprisoned Palestinians, including 30 children. But while the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire continues to hold, Israeli forces are ramping up attacks on the occupied West Bank, particularly in the Jenin refugee camp. “Israel is trying to turn [Jenin] into a clone of Gaza — ethnic cleansing, pushing people out and destroying homes systematically, one after the other. All of it is to explode the West Bank, to use it as a pretext for a major war to push Palestinians out,” says Shehada.', 'AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.', 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: Israel is scheduled to free 110 Palestinians, including 30 children, from its prisons, after Hamas released three Israelis and five Thai nationals held hostage in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The exchange took place as Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel and became the first senior American official to enter Gaza in nearly 15 years. Witkoff toured the Israeli-occupied Netzarim Corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, embedded among Israeli soldiers. Witkoff is also meeting today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who’s scheduled to visit Trump at the White House next week. Netanyahu’s trip comes just two months after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.', 'AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined right now by Muhammad Shehada, writer and analyst from Gaza. He’s chief of communications at Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, joining us from Copenhagen.', 'Muhammad, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you talk about what unfolded today in Gaza and, as of the time of this broadcast, what is expected to unfold when it comes to the prisoners released by Israel, Palestinian prisoners?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Sure. Thanks for having me, Amy.', 'So, today, Hamas released an Israeli soldier that was captured from Nahal Oz, Agam Berger, in addition to two other civilian Israeli hostages that were released in Khan Younis and five Thai workers.', 'There’s a significance in the way that the release was conducted. Agam Berger was released, basically, in Jabaliya, an area that Israel has wiped out over a process of over a hundred days of systematically destroying every single building in the city. Nothing is left standing. And in Khan Younis, the other hostages were released right in front of Yahya Sinwar’s house, also an area that Israel invaded, wiped out systematically, bombed indiscriminately. So, in both, there is the attempt to say that Israel had no clue throughout these 15 months how to get the hostages out militarily, and the only way to get them out is through a ceasefire, which has been the position mediators have been reiterating for over 15 months.', 'The other thing is that Netanyahu is trying desperately to use any loopholes in the agreement to collapse the ceasefire. We saw that last Saturday when he was supposed to open up the Netzarim Corridor and allow people to go to northern Gaza, and he withdrew from that last minute, postponed it indefinitely, until mediators pressured him. And it happened on Monday in return for hostages that were released today outside of the framework. Today he’s delaying and procrastinating the release of Palestinian captives and prisoners, citing that Hamas’s release of one of the hostages or two in Khan Younis was overcrowded and hostile to the hostages themselves. So he’s demanding a “safe passage,” quote-unquote, which, in other words, as Israeli media is warning us every single day, Netanyahu is trying everything he could to sabotage the deal from this early on. This is why you had Steve Witkoff go to Gaza to see it with his own eyes yesterday, before he even met with Netanyahu, to signify how little trust he has in the Israeli prime minister, to see the progress of the ceasefire on the ground himself and also to emphasize to Netanyahu that the deal has to be seen through.', 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And so, Muhammad, could you talk a little bit more about that, the significance of Witkoff’s visit? He was in Saudi Arabia before he came to Israel. He’s the first senior, as you said, U.S. official in years to actually go into Gaza. And today he met with Netanyahu, but also with his far-right Cabinet minister, Finance Minister Smotrich. So, you know, what do you make of this? And your assessment of his work on the ceasefire agreement that was reached, that could not — that the Biden administration failed to reach?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Thanks, Nermeen. Very good question. So, basically, with Witkoff, as you said, it’s the first visit in over 15 years. The last time we had a similar visit was John Kerry, when he was a U.S. senator, in 2009, very brief, didn’t even continue for over a day, so only border areas in Gaza and then left immediately. There was not even the pretense by any U.S. official ever since to want to see what’s inside Gaza. So, this is monumental in the sense that he broke a taboo that has been established for over a decade.', ""The other thing is that with Witkoff’s visit to Gaza, there’s also, as you said, the meetings with far-right Israeli ministers. The parallel track that he’s working on is the issue with transferring a million and a half Gazans to neighboring countries. And Israeli media, until last night, have been saying that this is a dead-serious topic that he’s discussing seriously with Netanyahu and his ministers. At the same time, we got the pulse of different sources in Israel, like a Cabinet minister who told The Times of Israel that this talk, this rhetoric about transferring Gazans outside, might appease the Israeli far right and allow Netanyahu to carry on with the deal. It might give Israel the alternative victory image, that it couldn’t destroy Hamas militarily, but now they want to maintain Gaza as an uninhabitable territory to push people to leave. So that might give them this alternative victory image. But on the other side, you have Palestinians saying immediately, “We’re not going to leave, no matter what.” Israel tried that repeatedly in 1951. That’s when they first started trying to convince Egypt to take 12,000 Gazans and resettle them into Sinai. Gazans protested, rioted in an intifada in '55 and killed it. My own family were kicked out of Gaza in ’67 to Egypt, and they were living there for about 27 years. They never forgot. They went back to Gaza as soon as there was an opportunity with the Oslo Accords. So it's not something that is going to be workable for Trump to carry out. You have even people from his own camp, like senators, that are saying that this is unworkable, this is improbable."", 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Muhammad, also, you know, before we move to other issues, the significance of Trump inviting Netanyahu, just as this is occurring, next week to the White House?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Well, it has two significances. Number one is that the U.S. is signaling that international law is obsolete, that they tossed it into the garbage. The international rule-based order is no longer valid, because you have here someone with arrest warrants on his head by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity being honored in Washington, D.C., and in the White House, the highest executive branch of government.', 'At the same time, the other significance is Trump has been showering Netanyahu, lavishing him and his far-right extremist ministers with an enormous, unprecedented gift bag from the moment he walked into office. Some of these gifts are under the pretext of bribing Netanyahu to agree to the ceasefire, but other elements in there have to do more with an extremist, messianic pro-Israeli agenda. So, for example, you have a U.S. immediate lifting of all sanctions on Israeli settlers and extremist groups that the Biden administration imposed. You also have an immediate process to sanction the International Criminal Court and collapse it because it dared to go after Israel. You have that visit to Washington, that Biden was reluctant to extend to Netanyahu despite Biden’s full complicity in the Gaza genocide. And you have other gift bags that are being showered on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu to buy their complicity and silence.', ""AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about UNRWA. International staff working for the U.N.'s main agency serving Palestinians have been forced to leave Israel after its ban on the agency came into effect. This is the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United — I want to go to the UNRWA spokesperson, Jonathan Fowler, who said Israel's decision could trigger a collapse of humanitarian aid to Palestinians."", 'JONATHAN FOWLER: We’re responsible for over half of deliveries inside the Gaza Strip, over half of the aid coming in. You know, UNRWA, I mean, has been described repeatedly — not by ourselves, but, you know, by others — as the backbone of the international aid operation, because the rest of the aid operation is just — the U.N. presence is just a few hundred people. A few hundred does not equal 5,000. Without UNRWA being able to operate, there’s a very real risk of this — the humanitarian operation collapsing.', 'AMY GOODMAN: So, this is extremely significant, Muhammad, UNRWA out as all the Palestinians are flooding into northern Gaza. If you can talk about both of these issues? Of course, UNRWA is larger than Gaza. It’s serving millions of Palestinians throughout the Middle East.', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: Precisely. Well, UNRWA is Gaza’s lifeline. If you take it out, this is a death sentence to Gaza’s population. Since the ceasefire was enacted, my inbox has been flooded with messages from colleagues, from family members, from friends and loved ones, who are literally begging to help to find them any place to stay, to help to even find a tent in northern Gaza, to help to find food to put on the table. If you take UNRWA away, it gets only way worse than this. Whatever rudimentary, basic level of survival that is sustained in Gaza now with the little aid that’s coming in, a lot of it is going to be explicitly banned by Israel, because the Israeli legislation, it bans any imports to Gaza with UNRWA’s label on it, as well as dismantling UNRWA’s network also in Lebanon, for example, where Palestinians are living in refugee camps in abysmal conditions. UNRWA is a vital lifeline there.', ""But it’s not only a matter of service provider. UNRWA has played a transformative role for many Palestinians. My own father, whose family were kicked out in '48 by Israel to a refugee camp, the Shati refugee camp in Gaza, he would have been a barefoot child with no life, with no income, with no purpose, if it wasn't for — in part, for UNRWA providing the infrastructure for education that brought him up as the doctor that I was very proud of until his death because of Israel’s blockade. I myself wouldn’t be standing in front of you now and speaking English and even knowing about politics or the history of the conflict or the history of the Holocaust, if it was not for my UNRWA educational system. I would have not had an educational opportunity. So, if you take all of that away from Gazans, it falls into Israel’s plan to prevent any capacity in Gaza to maintain organized human life, so that people would have to leave, so that Gaza is being emptied out completely. And that’s the main concern."", 'NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Muhammad, finally, if you could talk about the continuing Israeli assault in the West Bank, in particular, on Jenin?', 'MUHAMMAD SHEHADA: So, basically, part of the gift bag that Netanyahu gave to his extremist minister Bezalel Smotrich to agree to the ceasefire in Gaza was to extend the war goals, under the radar, quietly, to include the West Bank. So, now the West Bank, from Israel’s perspective, is a war zone. So, that’s why you have, for example, Israeli checkpoints booming and skyrocketing all across the West Bank, despite the IDF chief of staff, who is a settler himself, Herzi Halevi — he is not a pro-Palestinian left wing, but that IDF chief of staff, he warned Netanyahu and Smotrich. He said, “Don’t put these checkpoints. It will lead and push Palestinians to take to arms, to armed resistance, to resist Israel’s occupation.” But Netanyahu overruled him. In Jenin, you have a way worse dynamic than the rest of the West Bank, where Israel is trying to turn it into a clone of Gaza — ethnic cleansing, pushing people out and destroying homes systematically, one after the other. All of it is to explode the West Bank, to use it as a pretext for a major war to push Palestinians out. That’s the agenda of Israel’s extremist ministers at the moment.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Muhammad Shehada, we thank you so much for being with us, writer and analyst from Gaza, chief of communications at Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor. And that does it for our show. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. Thanks so much for joining us.']"

Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security advisor, was quick to attribute Israel’s ceasefires with both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza to the advent of a new administration.', 'Palpable apprehension in world capitals about what courses of action Trump might—or might not—pursue has been a powerful driver of events. However, the significance of January 20 as an inflection point cannot be overexaggerated. With Trump now ensconced firmly in the Oval Office, rhetoric alone will prove insufficient to induce tangible cooperation from the United States’ counterparts, who will be monitoring the pulse of his intentions rigorously.', 'Washington watchers in Jerusalem have been, unsurprisingly, surveying the appointments topography for clues to decipher Trumpland, but they have found its landscape equivocal. Israeli officials are encouraged by the nominations of friendlies Mike Huckabee and Elise Stefanik—as ambassadors to Israel and the United Nations, respectively—but diplomats are not policymakers, and the perspective of Trump’s executive cadre is by no means monolithic. The president himself has toggled in recent months between pledging to “stop all wars” and, on the other hand, telling Netanyahu to “do what you have to do” when it comes to Israel’s enemies. (Relations between the two leaders have known highs and lows.)', 'Soon after his victory, Trump unceremoniously disinvited Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, two trusted interlocutors of Israel during his previous tenure, from returning to his leadership team. That vacuum has been filled apparently by Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who both advocated on Capitol Hill for a strong US-Israel bond, but few other principals share their level of prior, high-level engagement with the intricate dynamics of that alliance. Meanwhile, senior bureaucratic echelons at the Pentagon—which has been an essential partner in enhancing Israel’s national security—are being populated by staffers who favor greater detachment from the Middle East.', 'It is against this backdrop that Netanyahu arrives in Washington to plead his case. His wish list from Trump will include US acquiescence for Israel to continue its campaign to dislodge Hamas rule from Gaza; normalization with Saudi Arabia; and a kinetic effort—or, at least, US backing for a potential solo Israeli endeavor—to terminate the threat of a nuclear Iran. The paradox of Netanyahu’s predicament is that Trump’s favorable disposition toward that agenda does not mean their approaches will be similarly aligned.', 'Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich—a stalwart critic of the current truce—is touting assurances from the prime minister to intensify the Gaza war and initiate “a gradual takeover” that ensures “humanitarian aid will not reach Hamas as it has been until now.” Smotrich, a proponent of exercising Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, has also vowed repeatedly to scuttle any diplomatic breakthrough with Riyadh that would entail territorial concessions to the Palestinians. On the Iranian front, Israeli military planners are training their sights increasingly on the near term, before Tehran can recover from the blows that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has inflicted on its defenses and on its Hamas and Hezbollah proxies.', 'Those parameters are almost certain to conflict with the president’s thinking. By all accounts, Trump, as evidenced through Witkoff’s interventions, is interested actually in extending the suspension of combat in Gaza, for the sake of securing the release of all captives and stabilizing the area. The track would then be cleared for Israeli-Saudi rapprochement—along lines that would likely be anathema to Smotrich—and a coveted Nobel Peace Prize for Trump. As for Iran, indications suggest that the president might prefer initially to try and settle that standoff through negotiations.', 'The ball is very much in Trump’s court now. Witkoff met on January 30 with Smotrich and Shas chairman Aryeh Deri, two key stakeholders of Netanyahu’s government, in an attempt to enlist their support for his mission, but their consent will hinge ultimately on the specifics involved. (Right-wing Israelis, who are hoping anxiously that Trump will adopt their cause, have latched tightly onto his manifest enthusiasm for transferring Gaza’s residents to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, although the wisdom and feasibility of that program—opposed stridently by those countries and by Palestinians themselves—are dubious.) The time for command decisions is close at hand.', 'Cessations of hostilities in Lebanon and Gaza are both fragile. Netanyahu’s coalition is also in crisis, with saber-rattling between its various members—who are at loggerheads over controversial legislation to exempt Ultra-Orthodox Jews from military service—jeopardizing the passage of a national budget before a March 31 deadline. Separately, Smotrich has committed to bolt unless the IDF resumes its Gaza incursion, in parallel with expanding counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank. Not only the prime minister’s political fate, but also the future of the entire Middle East is hanging in the balance, waiting for Trump to decide how much slack he is prepared to grant Netanyahu.', 'Much will depend on the president’s definition of friendship for Israel: Will it entail space for the IDF to keep fighting Hamas until the achievement of “total victory”—as Netanyahu has promised and many Israelis are still demanding—at the possible cost of derailing progress with Saudi Arabia? Will it, rather, obligate Israel to wind down its offensive and satisfy Saudi requirements for a pathway to Palestinian statehood, thus, in all likelihood, precipitating the collapse of Netanyahu’s majority in the Knesset? Or might it entertain tradeoffs such as greater Israeli flexibility vis-à-vis the Palestinians in exchange for an augmented US role in confronting Iran?', 'There will be inherent risks in any strategy that Trump chooses to embrace. The only certain thing is that now, as commander in chief, he controls an arsenal of formidable carrots and sticks to deploy in the service of his administration’s objectives. On February 4, the world will be watching to see whether he offers Netanyahu a deal that he can’t refuse.', 'Shalom Lipner is a nonresident senior fellow for Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council.
