Throughout the campaign, he highlighted his track record: The Minnesota DFL hasn’t lost a single statewide race since he took over the party.', 'Now Martin is tasked with a new challenge: strengthening and transforming the national party to withstand the second Trump administration.', '“We’re going to get to work,” Martin said Saturday in his acceptance speech. “We’re going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump.”', 'LIVE UPDATES\nThe latest on Trump’s presidency as tariff pledge comes due', 'The election of new party leaders comes as Democrats have grappled with the most effective way to challenge the torrent of action spurred by the Trump White House, which just this week included the president blaming diversity initiatives for a deadly DC plane collision, a federal funding freeze that was rescinded in less than 48 hours amid widespread backlash, and confirmation hearings for three controversial Cabinet nominees.', 'Martin easily defeated two other leading contenders: Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.', 'All three candidates claimed to have levels of support that, if combined, would have far exceeded 450 – the total number of voting DNC members. Heading into Saturday, Wikler claimed to have 183 endorsements and O’Malley claimed to have 137, though most of those names were private. Martin had released the names of 200 supporters.', 'The final vote showed that only one of the candidates was able to back their numbers up: Martin won with 246.5 votes out of 428 cast. Wikler received 134 votes and O’Malley received 44.', 'The results also showed the limited influence of high-profile endorsements. Wikler gained significant outside support in the final days of the campaign, thanks to endorsements from prominent governors, key labor leaders and top congressional leaders.', '“This is not personal, we’re all on the same team. … I have long-standing relationships in the party, and at the end of the day, I’m really buoyed by that enthusiastic support,” Martin told reporters after the vote. “It was a one-ballot victory for a reason, right?”', 'In addition to electing Martin, DNC members elected seven additional officers: Gun control activist David Hogg, Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and Nevada DNC member Artie Blanco were elected to three at-large vice chair positions; Virginia McGregor was reelected treasurer; Jason Rae was reelected secretary; Chris Korge was reelected national finance chair; and Reyna Walters-Morgan will be the next vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation.', 'Without a Democratic president in the White House, leadership of the party will be fractured over the next four years. And with Democrats in the minority in both the House and Senate, much of the focus on Capitol Hill will be aimed at blocking Trump’s agenda rather than advancing the party’s policy priorities.', 'Martin will be tasked with helping guide the party forward as it looks to rebound from stinging losses last November. Asked what his message is to Trump, Martin said: The gloves are coming off.', '“I’ve always viewed my roles as a chair of the Democratic Party to take the low road so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road,” Martin said. “So Donald Trump, Republican Party: This is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people.”', 'In addition to fundraising and messaging, Martin will also help steer the 2028 nominating process and create a campaign-in-waiting for the eventual Democratic nominee.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDemocrats grapple with their own message in Trump 2.0', 'He will also need to unite the committee and address several internal issues, including anger over a wave of layoffs last year, demands for increased transparency around budgets and spending, and frustration with campaign consultants.', 'Outgoing chair Jaime Harrison touched on some of those tensions at the top of the elections, when he condemned reports that some DNC members had been intimidated, pressured or threatened by donors who said they would withhold funding over their votes.', '“In this party, there will be no tolerance for that type of behavior,” Harrison said. “We must be united because too much is at stake right now in this country.”', 'State party leaders, particularly in non-battleground states, had pushed chair candidates to vow to invest more in their states, and rank-and-file members had called for a more democratized process to access exclusive committees made up of appointees.', '“I have never attended a DNC meeting where I left and said, ‘Huh, I learned something,’” Stephanie Campanha Wheaton, one of the Young Democrats of America’s DNC members and a Martin supporter, told CNN. “You show up and you are a pawn, and you nod your head yes to everything that has already been decided upon in committees that you don’t know how people got on.”', 'At the heart of the leadership elections is a desire to make sense of the party’s 2024 losses and chart a path out of political obscurity. In more than a dozen forums, questions have focused on how to win back young men and working-class voters, how to fight disinformation, and how to make better use of the millions for dollars flowing into the party.', '“It’s a sign of a healthy party to actually question each other, debate each other, think about the path forward,” said Tory Gavito, a Wikler backer and the president of Way to Win, a women-led donor coalition that co-hosted a DNC forum with the Texas Democratic Party. “And in this debating, the goal is to win.”', 'Martin entered the race first and was an early front-runner thanks to his yearslong relationships with the leaders of various state parties and other DNC members', 'Joe Salas, a California DNC member who backed Martin, said he believed the Minnesota chair understands the important role of local committees. On a personal level, he said Martin was the only high-ranking DNC leader to send him a congratulatory card welcoming him to the DNC when he was elected last year.', '“It goes to his point about organizing year-round: You can’t come to somebody a couple of months before an election and ask them to do something,” Salas said. “You have to make deposits before you make withdrawals.”', 'Wikler experienced a late surge in support fueled by key endorsements from a group of Democratic governors – including DNC voting members Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico – and four large public-sector unions, which issued a joint statement.', 'Many of the DNC voters who endorsed Wikler pointed to his track record in Wisconsin since becoming chair in 2019, including winning a liberal majority on the state Supreme Court that paved the way for more competitive legislative maps.', 'In addition to AFT, Wikler was backed by the leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; National Education Association; and Service Employees International Union. Other unions split their support among the leading candidates.', '“We felt like Ben Wikler was the one who could build worker power and expand the party’s base,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, of the joint union endorsement.', 'O’Malley, meanwhile, picked up public support from a handful of DNC members and high-profile Democrats such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. His critiques of Martin and Wikler became more pointed in the final days of the race.', 'The former governor ribbed Wikler for declining to preemptively release a list of donors to his chair campaign ahead of a Friday night FEC deadline and suggested Martin’s support is not as strong as it seems during a gaggle with reporters after a candidate forum Thursday.', '“When the totally inevitable front-runner, who’s been working at it for five years, shows himself not to be totally inevitable, I think it opens up for a larger debate,” O’Malley said.', 'In the days leading up to the election, the three front-runners released dozens of endorsements from key Democrats, only some of whom are able to vote in the election.', 'Soon after Martin announced he’d been backed by South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement helped former President Joe Biden win the 2020 Democratic primary, Wikler announced he had the support of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.', 'One key Democrat did not weigh in on who should be chair: former Vice President Kamala Harris. Though the party has spent weeks debating what went wrong during her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris did not endorse a candidate in the race.', 'Harris spoke on the phone this week with the three leading candidates in the race, a person familiar with the discussions told CNN. In the calls, which each lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, the candidates discussed their visions for the party and expressed their gratitude to Harris for her candidacy and commitment to stay involved with the party’s efforts going forward. The former vice president pledged to work closely with the winning candidate as soon as they’re elected, the source said.', '“In state after state, district after district, from house to house and door to door, you work to energize, organize and mobilize,” Harris said in a video address to the committee after the first round of votes. “And as we continue to fight for our ideals and to realize the promise of America, I will be with you every step of the way.”', 'This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Martin won 246.5 of 428 votes. Wikler came in second with 134.5 votes. Prior to his election, Martin served as a vice-chair for the DNC and also leads Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nIn a statement, Wikler thanked supporters and congratulated Martin on his victory.\n\n“While the vote didn’t go the way I hoped, I’m grateful that our whole party has embraced the vision and the values that our campaign lifted up,” Wikler said. “It’s time to fight for working people, across race and ethnicity, in every corner of the country; to build a permanent campaign that organizes and communicates year-round, in every place and on every platform.”\n\nThe vote comes at a difficult time for the party. Democrats lost the presidency and control of the Senate in November elections, as voters across the nation shifted to the right. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed the party’s favorability rating at it’s lowest since at least 2008.

He also said he helped raise $200 million for the state party over a five-year period.\n\nAccording to filings with the Federal Election Commission, Wikler just more than $726,562 during his campaign for DNC chair.

"What You Need To Know About The Knock-Down, Drag-Out Race To Lead Democrats Out Of The Wilderness",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ken-versus-ben-dnc-chair-preview_n_679d7d49e4b0d54b8bb888a9,"['', 'When a fired-up and fractious group of Democratic state party leaders, veteran operatives, activists, and labor leaders assembled to elect a new chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, a few short months after Donald Trump was first elected president, the race to lead the party attracted the national attention and ideological infighting one might expect from a high-profile Democratic Senate primary.', 'Eight years later, Trump is back in the White House — this time with a popular vote win, a sweep of all seven battleground states and gains among voters of color, who had leaned toward Democrats for decades.', 'But the November election results have not generated the kind of ideologically-tinged “battle for the soul” of the party that occurred in 2017.', 'Notwithstanding a pre-election forum on Thursday interrupted by left-wing activists, the DNC’s 450 members are set to elect a new DNC chair in National Harbor, Maryland, on Saturday based less on ideology and more on whose personality and résumé best equips them to manage the DNC’s fundraising and organizing bureaucracy, ensure a fair and seamless 2028 presidential primary and make the party’s case to the public.', 'The top contenders are Ken Martin, chair of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party; Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin; and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.', 'Faiz Shakir, a former presidential campaign manager to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), entered the race two weeks ago out of frustration with the lack of deeper discussion about the party’s vision and message for winning back working-class voters. He is, by his own admission, an extreme longshot for the top spot, but he has used his candidacy to call for a renewed focus on economic populism that is unafraid to identify corporations and other monied interests as enemies of workers.', 'Overall, though, the technical focus of the DNC chair’s race is part of a Democratic shift away from harnessing grassroots activism and a let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom approach to ideological disagreements. The most senior Democratic elected officials and potential contenders for the 2028 presidential nomination have largely declined to participate in public conversations about what policy or ideological direction the party should pursue going forward, or what mistakes former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris made in the run-up to Trump’s win.', 'And even many Democrats who want to see the party engage in deeper introspection believe that the DNC chair race is the wrong forum for those kinds of conversations.', 'Here is a look at each of the top contenders, their campaigns, and their odds of winning:', 'Martin, Wikler, and O’Malley broadly agree on two of the core problems the party is facing: declining support among working-class voters, and the right’s ability to outmatch them in the new media ecosystem.', 'Likewise, none of the candidates has said whether they think Biden should have dropped out of the presidential race sooner, or expressed a preference for a particular presidential primary schedule. The latter question is sure to be a pressing matter on the next chair’s agenda, though it is not entirely up to the chair; any plan must come out of the DNC’s bylaws committee and receive approval from the broader party membership.', 'Where they disagree most, though, is on who the best person to tackle the job is. Martin, who has led Minnesota Democrats since 2011, has run on “getting the DNC out of D.C.” — by, among other things, giving more money and power to state parties. That platform, and Martin’s tenure as chair of the Association of State Democratic Committees, an umbrella group for state parties, have given Martin a strong base of support among the state party chairs and vice chairs who make up a sizable chunk of DNC members. Martin has a history of leading state parties in intraparty fights with the DNC’s leadership in Washington.', 'To those in need of persuasion, Martin has touted his work turning around his state party’s finances, his flawless record in statewide races since taking over, and the construction of a two-year trifecta in Minnesota state government that enabled passage of a host of progressive reforms. His supporters also hail his work campaigning with and for Democrats across the country.', '“I am convinced he is not just here as a figurehead. He is here to be the voice of the Democrats.”', 'Sandra Williams, deputy political director of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union and a DNC member from Georgia, met Martin while he was campaigning for Democrats in Georgia during the 2018 and 2022 election cycles.', '“I am convinced he is not just here as a figurehead. He is here to be the voice of the Democrats,” Williams said. “To me, I can see Ken going all over the 50 states and the territories just to … have a close connection with us, to hear us, to listen.”', 'Minnesota Democrats’ electoral record is not exactly perfect under Martin. The party sent five Democrats to the U.S. House when Martin started and now has only four. Minnesota Democrats also lost their majority in the state House of Representatives last year — first by tying Republicans’ number of seats in November, and then by temporarily losing a safe Democratic seat when a vetted candidate was disqualified for not actually living in the district.', 'Wikler, a former Washington director of the liberal group MoveOn, is pitching DNC members on his record in Wisconsin, where he’s been party chair since 2019. He and his allies are keen to note that his experience is in a battleground state, rather than a light-blue state like Minnesota.', 'Wikler quickly scaled up his party’s fundraising, enabling him to hire more people and professionalize the party’s staff structure. His biggest coup came in 2023, when he decided to bet big on a liberal takeover of the state supreme court that led to the striking down of the state’s Republican-gerrymandered congressional and state legislative districts. Democrats went on to flip 14 legislative seats in 2024.', 'Bryan Kennedy, mayor of Glendale, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb, and the representative of Democratic municipal officials on the DNC, marveled at how transformative Wikler’s tenure had been in his Democratic city alone. The state party, which had never provided him significant help in the past, assigned an organizer to work on his campaign, cut his canvassing turf and funded direct-mail and digital ads on his behalf.', '“We have two really good choices and one is a little bit better than the other.”', '“Both Ben and Ken have a really strong skill set for this position, but one of them has built the infrastructure in the state and raised more money in less time than the other,” Kennedy said. “We have two really good choices and one is a little bit better than the other.”', 'In statewide races, in particular, Wikler’s record is not flawless. Then-Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes narrowly lost his Senate race in 2022 — a defeat Wisconsinites tend to blame on the national party — and Harris failed to carry the state in November. Wikler and his allies respond that Harris overperformed in Wisconsin relative to the other six battleground states, all of which she lost by more votes than Wisconsin.', 'Wikler’s biggest advantage has been a surge of support from national Democratic leaders and groups, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the biggest public-sector labor unions, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and Third Way.', 'These national Democratic power brokers see Wikler as something of a fundraising and digital organizing wunderkind, properly tested in battle as leader of a swing-state party. Some quietly see Martin’s deeper ties to state party leaders as a liability, rather than an asset, fearing he may be too deferential to state officials and provide them funding without insisting on a say in the state party’s electoral strategy.', 'Wikler is “more or less saying, ‘I’m not just going to say what you want, and here’s money,’” said someone close to Wikler who requested anonymity to protect their relationship with Martin and his supporters.', 'Wikler’s strategy, as this ally put it: “Hey, let us come in there and talk to you about what the best option is. And let’s get agreement on a race that you could win here.”', 'Of the top three DNC chair candidates, O’Malley is by far the underdog. A former Baltimore mayor and Maryland governor, he cannot claim to speak for a purple or even a light-blue state. His last bout in national politics was a largely forgotten presidential run in 2016.', 'But O’Malley and his supporters argue that he has an edge in executive experience, having run a large city, a state and, from 2023 to 2024, a Social Security Administration plagued by customer-service problems. That kind of work better prepares him to manage a large organization than running a state party would, his backers say.', '“Once Martin O’Malley becomes the DNC chair, I think there’s going to be a sense of relief that people have, that we have an adult in the room who’s ready to hit the ground running,” said Yvette Lewis, a DNC member from Maryland, who chaired the state party while O’Malley was governor.', 'Lewis also pointed out that O’Malley sounds a lot more like a seasoned politician. He’s comfortable in front of TV cameras, and thus may be better equipped to make Democrats’ case in the media.', '“After this election is over, the national shows are going to come calling,” Lewis added. “Who do we see as the person who can go right away on ‘Meet the Press’ or ABC’s ‘This Week’ and deliver the message of the way forward for the DNC? Martin O’Malley is the only one.”', ""“I don’t know who [Wikler's] billionaires are. Neither do you, because he won’t reveal who donated to him.”"", 'As is typical of a contender not leading the pack, O’Malley has shown a greater appetite for risk than Martin and Wikler. He’s admitted that Biden communicated his accomplishments poorly, and that Harris would have been better served by focusing more on her economic message.', 'He has also engaged in his share of attention-getting populist moves related to campaign finance. Unlike Martin and Wikler, he has joined the lesser-known candidates in committing to barring the DNC from accepting corporate PAC donations.', 'And in mid-January, he challenged his fellow contenders to join him in revealing their donors, something that is not required for DNC chair candidates. Martin acquiesced to his challenge, but Wikler, who Martin has attacked for his relationship with billionaire mega-donor Reid Hoffman, agreed only to disclose his donors by midnight before the vote on Saturday.', 'Following the candidate forum on Thursday night, O’Malley played coy when asked whether he was concerned about Wikler’s loyalty to Hoffman, who elicited controversy over the summer for calling on Harris to fire then-Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, an aggressive anti-monopolist.', '“I don’t know who his billionaires are,” O’Malley said. “Neither do you, because he won’t reveal who donated to him.”', 'Wikler revealed his donors Friday night. Hoffman and billionaire financier George Soros’ Democracy PAC each donated $250,000 to Wikler’s campaign.', 'Martin was the early frontrunner shortly after announcing his bid in November with what he said were 100 commitments from voting DNC members, and he remains the frontrunner going into voting on Saturday. On Friday night, Martin announced that he had pledges of support from over 200 voting DNC members. If all 450 members show up to vote on Saturday, that puts him 26 votes shy of the number he’d need to win outright on the first ballot.', 'Wikler, who picked up the endorsement of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Friday, said he had 183 pledges of support.', 'O’Malley said he had 137 commitments from DNC voting members.', 'Martin is the only one of the three to publicize a complete list of endorsers, making him the one to beat ahead of voting.', 'If Martin doesn’t get an outright majority in the first round, however, some observers expect Wikler to gain the upper hand in the second round of voting. O’Malley’s camp maintains that he is well-poised to become a consensus candidate in that scenario, but it seems unlikely that such a path would open up for him where it hadn’t before.', 'Should O’Malley drop out after the first round of voting, Martin and Wikler are sure to jockey aggressively for his endorsement. He would be in a position to secure a future political favor from either candidate, should he choose to do so. Even if O’Malley decides against an endorsement and the concomitant dealmaking it would likely entail, his voters’ alternative choices would likely determine the winner.', ""By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

For comparison, Joe Biden entered office with a 57% approval rating from Gallup.', 'Martin takes over a political party in desperate need of new leadership and a new strategy.', 'Trump’s low approval rating is a reminder that, contrary to what the president and his MAGA allies have said, his win in November was not a “landslide” and the American people didn’t give him some sweeping mandate. But if that’s the case, you may be asking yourself: How did he win the White House? And why are Republicans in control of the House and the Senate too? ', 'Well, it turns out, people dislike the Democrats even more. A recent Wall Street Journal poll showed 60% of Americans view the party unfavorably.

The race has attracted a large field of candidates, but two state party chairs – Ken Martin of Minnesota and Ben Wikler of Wisconsin – have emerged as the frontrunners.', 'Until its final days, the chair race had appeared rather sleepy, an accurate reflection of a party exhausted after a grueling and ultimately disastrous presidential election. But the chair candidates have grown punchier as the race draws to a close, and the late entry of Faiz Shakir, who ran Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, has injected new energy into the race.', 'All of the candidates seem to agree that the Democratic party needs to move in a new direction after their 2024 losses, expanding its outreach to the working-class Americans who have lurched to the right in recent years and finding more effective means of communicating their values to voters. But the candidates have squabbled over the best strategies and prioritization of those goals, in a display that Shakir said showed a “lack of ambition and a sense of powerlessness about what the DNC could potentially do”.', '“The question to my mind now is that if there is consensus around the working class confronting oligarchy, then what new ideas are we bringing to the table in how we utilize the power and authority of the DNC?” Shakir told the Guardian. “My election would send the strongest message that we’re doing something different.”', 'Even with Shakir’s late entry, Martin appears to have the advantage heading into the elections on Saturday, when the 450 voting members of the DNC will convene in National Harbor, Maryland, to choose their next chairperson and fill several other key leadership positions. Martin claimed last week that he had already secured the support of at least 200 members, putting him within striking distance of the majority needed to win, but Wikler and other candidates have questioned that whip count.', 'A spokesperson for Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who appears to be running third in the chair race, told ABC News last week that “not a single soul running for any DNC office” believes Martin’s whip count. Wikler said on Tuesday that he had the support of at least 183 members, putting him not far behind Martin, and he insisted he had the momentum heading into Saturday’s vote. After already securing the support of Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, Wikler also received a last-minute boost from Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, who endorsed him on Wednesday.', 'Still, Martin has racked up a string of endorsements from party leaders like Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and former vice-presidential nominee, and his long-running ties with the DNC may push him over the finish line.', '“In Minnesota, Ken has built a national model for how to elect Democrats in a competitive state,” Walz said in his endorsement. “I have seen Ken’s leadership in action, and it’s exactly what we need from our next DNC chair.”', 'In another sign of Martin’s strength, one of his opponents – James Skoufis, a New York state senator who had launched a long-shot bid for the chair post – endorsed him after dropping out of the race earlier this month.', '“The years ahead will be tough. We will be on the outside,” Skoufis said in a statement. “The Democratic party must be laser-focused on demonstrating our commitment to working men and women and fighting like hell to win races up and down the ballot. I am here for that fight and look forward to that fight, in all 50 states and all of America’s 3,244 counties, alongside Ken.”', 'But Wikler’s allies described the race as a jump ball, as many DNC members remain undecided. While Martin’s supporters frame his extensive experience with the DNC as an asset, his opponents have painted the Minnesota chair’s potential victory as the perpetuation of a failed status quo that cost Democrats dearly in November.', '“This DNC chair race is important for sending a signal to voters that Democrats have learned a lesson and will do things differently going forward,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), which has endorsed Wikler. “If it sends a signal that we stand for the status quo and want to do everything the same, that will be a turnoff both to the Democratic base and to swing voters who want to see that Democrats are doing something different.”', 'Wikler’s advocates point to his leadership in Wisconsin – where down-ballot Democrats outperformed Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump by 0.9 points in the battleground state – as evidence of his prowess in campaign strategy.', '“A lot of people have professional respect for Ken. I don’t know him. I’m sure he’s fine, but we don’t need ‘fine’ in this moment,” Green said. “We need to do things differently.”', 'And despite Wikler’s progressive bona fides as a former senior adviser to the group MoveOn, he has managed to assemble an ideologically diverse coalition of supporters as he seeks the chair position. The same day that the PCCC announced its endorsement of Wikler, the center-left group Third Way threw its backing behind him as well.', 'Kate deGruyter, senior director of communications Third Way, praised Wikler as a battle-tested leader who had developed a winning formula for carrying Democrats to victory in swing districts.', '“If you look at a nationwide map, what you will see is that Democrats have largely become a party of the coasts and that we have really hemorrhaged support in the middle of the country,” DeGruyter said. “We really like the idea of having a chair who comes from one of these states that Democrats absolutely need to win and where we really need to work on reconnecting with voters.”', 'No matter who wins the chair race, the victor will undeniably face significant hurdles in implementing a meaningful agenda. In recent years, the DNC has served as a largely administrative body focused on fundraising, spreading party messaging and setting rules for presidential primaries.', '“When Democrats have a Democratic president in charge, it is often the case that [the DNC] is working at the behest of the president of the United States,” Shakir said. “But now when we don’t have the presidency, you take that structure and you say, ‘What is the most important thing that we have to do?’”', 'The DNC chair will certainly not be the sole arbiter of where Democrats go from here, DeGruyter ackowledged, but the winner of the race will become an influential voice in the discussion over how Democrats can and, in her view, must change.', '“It would be a dangerous mistake to assume that we don’t need to really wrestle with some fundamental changes to the way that we approach building a winning coalition,” DeGruyter said. “And so I think it’s really a moment to reflect on how we win the battle of reasonableness with voters.”']"

But to do that, the Democrats must turn themselves into a fighting force for economic justice.', 'Candidates for DNC chair meet in Detroit on January 16, 2025.', 'Democrats are reeling from the defeats they suffered in last November’s election. On Saturday, they have their first big chance to determine how to bring themselves back from the political wilderness—by selecting a new slate of leaders for the Democratic National Committee.', 'The party has credible candidates for the post of DNC chair, and for the various vice chair and executive positions that will be filled by the 448 party insiders, labor leaders, and elected officials who will make the call.', 'Much of the media has been focused on the contest for chair because of the prospect that the winner could emerge as a leading face of opposition to the dangerous presidency of Donald Trump. That’s especially true, argue activists with groups such as MoveOn and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, if it is a dynamic figure such as Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair Ben Wikler, one of two front-runners in the race for the top job, the other being Minnesota party chair Ken Martin, a veteran organizer who was mentored by progressive former US senator Paul Wellstone.', 'Certainly, pushing back against Trump will be a vital task for the new top team. But that’s not enough. Democrats need leaders who will drive a radical transformation of their party’s character and vision. After all, this is a political organization that, despite its considerable resources and hard-working candidates, could not muster enough support in 2024 from its traditional base of working-class voters to defeat Republicans with positions so irrationally plutocratic that they would, just a few years ago, have been on the far fringe of American politics.', 'The overhaul must be both internal and external.', 'What’s needed is a Democratic Party where grassroots activists and their allies in labor, environmental, and civil rights organizations sweep the pablum of past messaging aside and replace it with an absolute commitment to economic and social and racial justice that gives frustrated Americans something to vote for.', 'That means that the next DNC chair cannot be simply a competent manager—or, worse yet, a mere fund-raising complement to the party’s plodding congressional leadership. The chair, along with the vice chairs, must lead in a way that ensures that Trump and his minions aren’t the only ones defining our political moment.', 'History tells us what is required. The party has had transformational chairs in the past: Paul Butler, who was known for “his acidly articulate speeches against the Democratic leaders of Congress, southern segregationists” in the 1950s; Ron Brown, who made a real commitment to diversity and new-voter mobilization (with the help of the Rev. Jesse Jackson) in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and Howard Dean, who introduced the 50-state strategy with considerable success in the 2000s. But what the party needs just now is a new Fred Harris—a 21st-century version of the fierce Oklahoma populist who shook up the DNC during his brief tenure in the late 1960s and early 1970s.', 'They don’t make politicians like Harris anymore. But today’s DNC members should be looking for a leader who can approximate his combination of internal and external populism.', 'Harris, the senator from Oklahoma who famously sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 with the slogan “Tax the Rich!”—and the campaign promise of “No More Bullshit!”—died last fall at age 94. Most of the obituaries remembered him as a committed anti-racist (he was the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission, which identified “pervasive discrimination and segregation” as an explanation for the riots that swept American cities in the 1960s), the one senator who had the wherewith all to vote against the Supreme Court nomination of Lewis (“Powell Memorandum”) Powell, and the champion of a progressive populism that anticipated the anti-corporate, pro-worker, take-down-the-oligarchs politics of the Rev. Jesse Jackson Jr., Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.', 'But Harris also had a brief rip-it-up-and-start-again tenure as chair of the Democratic National Committee.', 'His time in charge was too short—less than a year and a half in 1969 and 1970. While Harris put the pieces in place to empower grassroots Democrats, he was not given the time to complete the work of making the Democrats into the sort of multiracial, multiethnic, 50-state movement for economic justice that he envisioned.', 'Now, more than 50 years after Harris’s time as DNC chair, Democrats need to finish the work he started if there is to be any hope for the party’s future.', 'When Harris was named DNC chair in January of 1969, a Time magazine report on the selection was headlined, “Nowhere to Go But Up.” The party was in dire straits following the 1968 election. Four years after Lyndon Baines Johnson had won the 1964 presidential election with an epic 61–39 popular vote win that swept Democrats into office nationwide, Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, won just 42.7 percent of the vote in a race that he lost to Republican Richard Nixon.', 'After a Democratic National Convention that saw violence on the streets of Chicago and chaos within the hall, the Democratic coalition fell apart, with Northern liberals backing Humphrey as Southern segregationists and many Northern working-class voters backed the race-baiting third-party bid of Alabama Governor George Wallace. It was so bad that Time wrote that, for Democrats, “the consoling advantage of falling so low, as drunks and defeated politicians both know, is that there is nowhere further to fall.”', 'Harris, then a 38-year-old-year firebrand whom Humphrey had considered for a vice-presidential running-mate, was put in charge of cleaning up the mess. But the senator’s vision was more ambitious than that.', 'He wanted to remake the Democratic Party as a movement organization with the mission of fighting poverty in America. Harris promised, “We’ll make the party so vigorous on issues, that the people we need will want to get involved.”', 'To accomplish his goals, Harris fought to make sure that the party welcomed newcomers. Recalling the 1968 convention, he said, “The Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African-Americans.”', 'Harris worked to knock down barriers to participation by women, people of color and the young anti–Vietnam War activists who had backed the 1968 campaigns of Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy. He created a commission that successfully reformed the delegate selection process for future national conventions—seeking to replace bosses and backroom deals with something akin to democracy.', 'There was pushback in Harris’s time, just as there is pushback today. But the Oklahoman knew that the Democratic Party needed to change.', 'Harris wanted to identify the Democrats as the vehicle for raising people of all races out of poverty and to make the party the political wing of the working class. While he served as DNC chair, Harris was still a senator. When Nixon proposed welfare reforms that would guarantee a minimum annual income of $1,600 for a family of four, Harris pushed back, saying, “A floor at such a low level. Instead of raising families out of poverty, would mean for many a sad plunge into the lower depths of ever greater poverty.”', 'The Oklahoman’s alternative was a bold plan to provide economic security for all Americans. He advocated for stronger unions, higher wages and government interventions that would assure that no family would fall below the 1970 poverty line of roughly $3,900.', 'That was a radical vision for fundamental change—not just of the Democratic Party but of the country. Pushed by Harris and his allies at various stages in the early 1970s, many in the party entertained a move toward the sort of progressive populism that would later be exemplified by Harris aide Jim Hightower. Unfortunately, the work of making the party the clear-eyed, unequivocal advocate for the working class that was needed to overcome the divisions of that era was never completed.', 'Decades later, Hightower and many others argue that this approach is still viral to overcome the divisions of the current era. Since the 2024 election, their argument has gained traction, and has become a focus of the race for party chair.', 'When he was DNC chair and later as a presidential candidate, Fred Harris sought to create a Democratic Party that was recognized for its opposition to privilege.', '“The fundamental problem is that too few people have all the money and power, and everybody else has too little of either,” he argued. “The widespread diffusion of economic and political power ought to be the express goal—the stated goal—of government.”', 'ELIE MYSTAL', 'JEET HEER', 'NINA LUO', 'JOAN WALSH', 'And of a Democratic Party that, along with new leadership, needs a fresh commitment to fighting as a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational, multiregional alternative to the politics of privilege that has empowered Donald Trump and Elon Musk.', ""John Nichols is a national affairs correspondent for The Nation.

While Democrats aim to reorganize themselves ahead of the midterms, one thing Martin will be ""charged with overseeing is the 2028 Democratic presidential early primary calendar as leaders across the states have started to weigh in on who should be in the early lineup.""', 'Martin has also been working to paint himself favorably in the eyes of working-class voters, many of whom shunned Democrats in the last election. He ""cast himself as a friend of labor and the son of a single mother who grew up in poverty and can bring the working class back into the party in both red and blue states,"" said The Minnesota Star Tribune.', 'He has also ""promised a \'big tent\' approach and drew endorsements from both left-leaning and more moderate officials,"" said the Times.

Viral clips and podcast appearances can go only so far if our party’s brand is unappealing.

He started the race as the favorite, and picked up endorsements from three minor candidates who failed to get traction.', 'Addressing reporters on Saturday, Martin said that the party would study what', 'went wrong as it aggressively organized against President Trump and the GOP.', '“We know that we lost ground with Latino voters. We know we lost ground with women and younger voters, and, of course, working class households,” he said. “We don’t know the how and why of this, and that’s what I need to get my hands around.”', '', 'Martin’s first-ballot victory, with 244.5 votes of the 214.5 needed to win, came hours after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries endorsed his top rival: Wisconsin Democratic chair Ben Wikler. But Martin didn’t see his win as a rebuke of the congressional party.', '“This is not personal,” he told Semafor, saying that a top DNC goal would be helping Jeffries win the House in 2026. “I spent the last eight years building infrastructure around the country.”', 'A longtime progressive activist who took over his state party six years ago, Wikler highlighted his years-long plan to break the GOP’s control of Wisconsin’s courts and legislature, and his record as an organizer at MoveOn early in Donald Trump’s first term.', '“This country should not be rigged against you by people who already have everything,” Wikler told DNC members before the vote at a resort hotel in Maryland’s National Harbor.', 'But Martin, the early front-runner for the job, maintained his lead and benefitted from years of relationships with sometimes beleaguered state parties. And Wikler faced grumbling from some of the other progressives in the race for how he’d run his party and his campaign.', 'Marianne Williamson, who had run for president in 2020 and 2024, criticized him for removing her and other Biden primary challengers from the 2024 primary ballot. Faiz Shakir, who managed the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, used his speech to DNC members to note that he didn’t form a PAC to run or hand out “trinkets” to voters, two criticisms that applied to Wikler.', 'Shakir’s last-minute entry into the race, as a reform candidate who warned that “identity politics” were hurting the Democrats, got broad media attention but little support from DNC members.

And those relationships proved essential, as he clinched a majority of the voting members on the first ballot, more than 100 votes above the second place finisher, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler.', 'The race hinged more on the candidates’ organizing and fundraising resumes than on their postures regarding the ideological soul of the party, as it did in 2017, after President Donald Trump’s previous election win. Martin was the more experienced hand with deep party relationships, Wikler had been at the center of some of Democrats’ highest-profile races in recent years, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley had unique electoral and government experience.', 'Addressing the DNC membership after his victory, Martin called for party unity after a relatively quiet race that got chippy at times, and for the party to focus on opposing President Donald Trump.', '""We have one team, the Democratic Party, and we have one fight. The fight’s not in here, it’s out there,” he said.', '“The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.” ', 'Now, Martin will be tasked with helping to pull Democrats out of the hole where they ended 2024, a devastating election cycle that left them without any of the levers of power in Washington. But while Martin will help to lead the party forward, Democrats aren’t necessarily looking to him to be the party’s pre-eminent leader.', '“We’re a party out of power, so we don’t have a leader. And I think broadly, philosophically, someone could say that this person would be our party leader. That’s not really true,” said Matt Corridoni, a veteran Democratic strategist who has worked for the committee in the past and also worked on a previous race for DNC chair.', '“I don’t know that anyone has ever really looked to the most recent DNC chairs and said, that person was a leader of our party,” Corridoni continued, before framing the role of the DNC chair as nailing down the ""nuts and bolts of operating the party.""', '“What this person will really be tasked with at the end of the day is planning a primary process, making sure that the state parties have the funding and infrastructure they need to be successful, and planning our next convention,"" he said.', 'That notion is not lost on Martin, who framed the chair role during his campaign as doing the important party-building work that will set the foundation for the Democratic candidates to use up and down the ballot, while helping to set the message as the party takes on Trump.  ', '""Donald Trump, the Republican Party, this is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people,"" Martin said during a session with reporters shortly after his victory.', '""The role of the party is not just to go out there and build the infrastructure,"" Martin added. ""It\'s also to make sure we\'re defining them and we\'re out there making sure the American people know what the stakes of not only these coming elections are, but what\'s happening in this country.""', 'During that session with reporters, Martin said that his first priorities as chair will be looking ""at the state of the party, the finances,"" looking at the party\'s ""contracts"" and starting a ""post-election review process.""', '""We don\'t call it a post-mortem or an autopsy, because our party\'s not dead. It\'s still kicking right?"" Martin said.', '""The reality is,"" he added, ""what we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened last election cycle. We know that we lost ground with Latino voters, we know we lost ground with women and younger voters and of course working-class voters. We don\'t know the how and why yet.""', ""The front-runners were largely in agreement during the race about what the DNC needed to do to move forward: ensure the party has the resources to contest every race across every state and territory, adopt a permanent organizational posture to help build relationships between the party and its potential voters, and take a postmortem look at Democratic Party's spending, after it fell short at the presidential level despite significantly outspending Trump and Republicans. All of the candidates also talked about pushing to bring their message to new media outlets while highlighting new messengers in part as a way to fix a deeper problem — Democratic underperformance with young and Hispanic voters. "", 'Throughout the race to succeed outgoing DNC chair Jaime Harrison, Martin framed himself as the experienced choice to take the reins of the party organization. Over a decade of experience leading the Minnesota party, he has regularly touted his unbeaten record in statewide races, arguing his state has been a Democratic beacon of hope while the party has taken important losses in other Midwestern “blue wall” states.', 'As head of the Association of State Democratic Chairs and a vice chair of the national party committee, combined with his record, Martin had developed relationships with party members to help him shore up the votes needed to emerge victorious despite a last-minute push from Wikler.', 'Those relationships helped Martin amass about 200 public endorsements from the voting body of the DNC, far more than any other candidate. And while Wikler touted support from top congressional Democrats, Martin snagged high-profile endorsements of his own, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats’ 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the powerful congressman who helped jumpstart Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential bid. ', 'During a brief address to the DNC’s Poverty Council Thursday afternoon, Martin pointed to Trump’s implication that a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programs was to blame for Wednesday night’s tragic aircraft collision in Washington, D.C. ', '“We’ve got to unify quickly as a party because the stakes have never been higher for this nation. What we’ve seen these last two weeks is despicable. They’re shattering people’s lives, they’re destroying communities already two weeks into it,” Martin said, before going on to describe his childhood being raised by a young mother in poverty, “in and out of shelters.” ', '“Our fight right now is for working people throughout this country,” Martin added. “Think about Donald Trump’s administration, their cabinet is worth $460 billion. Not the top 1%, the top 100th of 1%. You think they give a damn about people like me, people like you or working people and families like mine that are struggling? … Our fight right now is a fight for the future and it’s a fight for workers and it’s a fight for people who are trying to get into the middle class.”', 'Wikler fell short despite a late push and endorsements from major Democratic Party figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, along with governors like Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Kansas’ Laura Kelly. Wikler also secured the support of major unions including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National Education Association, American Federation of Teachers and Service Employees International Union. ', 'In a statement congratulating Martin, Wikler called on ""everyone who supported me to join me in working with Chair Martin to ensure that the Democratic Party rises to this moment of crisis in our country. ""', 'The race lacked the deep ideological divide of the last competitive race for chair in 2017, when the party had to pick up the pieces of a disappointing election loss as well as a party fractured by the hacking and release of internal party emails that exacerbated the divide between progressives and establishment Democrats.', ""Even though the race didn't have the fireworks of some other past races, Harrison took to the microphone multiple times before Martin's election to issue vague warnings against those who were bullying DNC members for their vote."", '“I’ve heard over the course of the last few days, while we were here, that people have been threatened about their vote, people have been intimidated by their vote, that folks have been having donors called and say they’re going to pull funding because of their vote,” he said.

‘Minnesota nice has 2 sides’: Why some Dems see a ruthless leader in Ken Martin,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/01/ken-martin-dnc-democrats-00201955,"['ELECTIONS', 'How a quiet, Midwestern operative won control of the Democratic Party’s apparatus.', 'Even Ken Martin’s supporters acknowledge that he’s been working toward becoming DNC chair “for years.” | Rod Lamkey, Jr./AP', 'By ELENA SCHNEIDER', '02/01/2025 08:16 PM EST', '', 'For two months as he campaigned for Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin worked methodically through a call sheet of the committee’s 448 members, sometimes on the phone for as long as an hour, even two hours, at a time, often until 10 p.m.', 'It was the kind of exhaustive, behind-the-scenes operative work Martin knew best from his time leading Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and the Association of State Democratic Parties, where he built a reputation as a mild-mannered tactician with a Midwestern work ethic.', 'But it was another side of Martin — what one DNC member, granted anonymity to speak candidly, called his ability to be a “knife-fighter” — that Democrats and their new chair himself on Saturday appeared to embrace.', '“Minnesota nice has two sides: Minnesota nice is a pleasant, earnest ability to engage with people publicly, and it is also a private ruthlessness and a coldness that only comes when you’ve lived in 10-degree-below weather half your life,” said John Bisognano, who worked with Martin at the ASDC and now serves as the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “Ken will cut you if he has to, but that ruthlessness is what we need to achieve electoral success.”', 'Martin looked to cement that image in his first remarks to the press as chair on Saturday, after defeating Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who had the backing of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.', '“I’ve always viewed my role as a chair of the Democratic Party to take the low road, so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road, meaning, I’m going to throw a punch,” Martin said.', 'He suggested, implicitly, that he would be a departure from the party’s previous chair, Jaime Harrison, telling reporters, “This is a new DNC” and that “we’re taking the gloves off.”', 'That kind of combativeness may be necessary for Martin, as he stares down a void in leadership and direction for his party. Democrats enter 2025 deflated, locked out of power in Washington after losing ground nearly everywhere in November. But the party’s setbacks may also elevate Martin’s role within it. As Democrats look to reassert themselves in Donald Trump’s second term — and without a Democrat in the White House to shape the party’s message — Martin will play a significant role in setting the terms of the 2028 presidential primary, from its debate qualifications to its nominating calendar.', 'He also committed to publicly releasing a post-mortem on the 2024 election, something the DNC did not do after its loss in 2016.', 'But Martin doesn’t come out of the DNC chair race unscathed.', '“Yes, he’s a knife-fighter, but the problem is, a lot of people in this room feel like that knife is in their backs,” said a second DNC member who didn’t support Martin. “He won the job, but he didn’t necessarily win everyone’s trust.”', 'Wikler, who super-charged the Wisconsin Democratic Party, was described by some DNC members as a reformer who could turn the DNC into a more powerful and well-funded institution. A former podcast host himself, Wikler was also seen by some as a more forceful messenger. Martin, said a third DNC member who also backed Wikler and granted anonymity to speak candidly, brings “institutional knowledge,” but is “part of the same group of people who have always been here, who don’t want to leave the room, and who haven’t yet made it better.”', '“We are so bound up by people whose only quest for relevance is the DNC title,” the member added.', 'Even Martin’s supporters acknowledge that he’s been working toward becoming DNC chair “for years,” as Ray Buckley, the New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, put it — from his appearances at obscure party meetings and tasteless fundraising dinners to his campaigning across 40 states during the last election cycle.', '“He knows the machine. He literally understands all of the levers, all the ways the resources move, all the relationships with people who make it move,” said Ron Harris, a DNC member from Minnesota.', 'And, Harris noted, “He knows where the bodies are buried.”', 'Given that deep knowledge, Martin has, at times, been a pain for top leadership and staffers at the DNC, who squared off with Martin in 2018 during several intraparty squabbles over control of voter data — a valuable asset that’s primarily held by state parties. At the time, then-Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez accused Martin, by name, of undermining the DNC by not keeping other state party chairs “in the loop” of the negotiations.', 'In those negotiations, Martin “threw up every block imaginable to keep the party from basic modernizing in order to keep their lists, even though Republicans were already way ahead of us at the time,” said an operative who was involved in the discussions at the time and given anonymity to discuss private conversations. “I would hope that he brings that same loyalty to his new constituency, a broader constituency, that he now has as chair.”', 'Buckley, a former ASDC president, saw it differently. “There are establishment folks in the party that are still not over the fact that Ken pushed back,” Buckley said. “They’re not used to getting pushed back.”', '“He’s turned the ASDC into a force that now has a much bigger seat at the table when we sit down to advocate for our states in front of the DNC,” said Mike Schmuhl, chair of the Indiana Democratic Party. “This is his life’s work, and he’s been working on this for years.”', 'Some of Martin’s intensity, his backers said, comes from his own childhood — the son of a single mom who had him at 15 years old.', '“We were in and out of shelters. We knew what poverty felt like. We saw what she sacrificed to make sure we could have a warm dinner most nights,” Martin said in his speech to DNC members on Saturday. “Because my mom gave a damn about me and because my community gave a damn about my family, it meant we had a chance.”', 'Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb, another Martin ally, said Martin “really had to learn how to rely on himself through struggle, and I think that that does come through in his personality of leadership.”', 'Martin came up in politics as a Minnesota political staffer in 1998, when pro wrestler Jesse Ventura and his Reform Party won the governorship and Democrats notched less than a third of the statewide vote. By the time he became the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in 2011, Democrats had only just started to reassert themselves electorally. But the party itself was in shambles — and in debt. Martin plotted a 10-year rebuilding plan that put the DFL back at the center of the Democratic ecosystem.', '“He ran the DFL with an iron fist, was very impressive,” said a Democratic strategist, also granted anonymity to discuss Martin candidly. “He’s like Stalin, and I say that as a compliment.”', 'Now, Martin faces another party at a deficit. But some Democrats are not convinced he’ll be able to pull off the same rebrand. Of particular concern, they said, was a frustrated donor class, many of whom preferred Wikler.', '“The delegates wanted Ken, and that must be completely respected. It wasn’t a close race,” said one Democratic donor adviser, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “However, the donors wanted Ben, and they will make the delegates and the new chair painfully aware of that fact over the course of the next four years.”', 'Holly Otterbein contributed to this report.', '', '© 2025 POLITICO LLC']"
