No title found,https://www.thefp.com/p/why-im-backing-rfk-jr,"['My friend Erick Erickson has written and spoken extensively in opposition to the nomination of another friend of mine, Bobby Kennedy Jr., for the job of secretary of Health and Human Services. I have known Erick for over 20 years. I have known Bobby for a few years. I support the nomination of Bobby Kennedy Jr. in respectful disagreement with Erick—who laid out his views, and the personal experience that informs them, in a recent heartfelt piece for The Free Press titled “Big Pharma Saved My Life.”', 'Big Pharma really did save Erick and his wonderful wife Christy’s lives after they were each diagnosed at virtually the same moment with life-threatening medical problems. I love them both, I prayed for them both when they were diagnosed, and I cheered for them both when the drugs worked.', 'Like Erick, I am alive thanks to an innovative drug produced by Big Pharma. In my case, after being diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2011, I was able to take a breakthrough drug called brentuximab in a trial during my treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Brentuximab targets the cancer cells rather than carpet-bombing my entire body, and it worked. It is now part of the standard of care for many Hodgkin’s cancer patients.', 'Like Erick, I’m grateful. And I hope the shareholders of the company that made the drug that saved my life are rolling in money. (After I said as much in an Oversight Committee hearing in 2019, my Democrat opponent in the 2020 Congressional race ran probably $10 million in ads accusing me of being “in the hip pocket” of Big Pharma.)', 'But unlike Erick, my appreciation for pharmaceutical innovation does not change my support for Bobby Kennedy. Why? Because innovation isn’t the problem. The problem is a horribly broken and corrupt system of government and corporate collusion that results in terrible health outcomes for the average American. We too often subsidize the consumption of unhealthy foods, while becoming increasingly reliant on medications and vaccines, with prescriptions at historic highs and Americans receiving close to 50 vaccinations by the age of 18. Meanwhile we make the very drugs and medical procedures that can save lives unaffordable due to regulations and mandates.', 'I don’t think Erick or other conservative RFK Jr.-doubters oppose him because they disagree with that statement. Instead, they claim that RFK Jr. will jeopardize the few parts of that badly broken system that still work, including some of the best hospitals in the world and the innovation that saved my life and Erick’s and his wife’s. That’s where we differ. Kennedy’s willingness to be disruptive and to bring transparency and accountability to the system is precisely why I support him. Because what we have right now is not good enough, and the parts that do work are going to dissolve into oblivion if we do not act quickly.', 'I realize naysayers on the right will say that Bobby supports single-payer healthcare. That may have once been true, but based on my conversations with him, I don’t think that’s true today. In any case, Republicans talk a big game about “free market” healthcare, but it no longer exists. Instead, what we have is a system that is 100-percent regulated, nearly 50-percent publicly funded, government-mandated, and dominated by giant, vertically integrated health insurance companies.', 'It offers Americans declining amounts of care, choice, and freedom. Thirteen years ago, I received lifesaving treatment at MD Anderson. Today, my current employer, the United States Congress, offers only Obamacare, which would not cover treatment at that hospital.', 'So, fellow conservatives, spare me the lectures about “single payer.” We need massive disruption if we want to save what I call healthcare freedom. And, as I have explained to Bobby, we need it quickly. I have shared with him the report on “The Case for Healthcare Freedom” that I published last week, and I will work with him tirelessly to empower patients, and stop handouts to healthcare special interests.', 'Don’t underestimate what RFK Jr. is up against. The current Congress, and most politicians, will not take on Big Healthcare. They spent $750 million in 2023 lobbying the federal government—five times more than the defense lobby spends. We spend $5 trillion a year on healthcare in this country, and our life expectancy lags behind comparable nations. Between 2010 and 2019, life expectancy in the U.S. only grew by 0.1 years compared to an average increase of 1.2 years in peer countries. We spend three times more per capita than Italy, but we live seven fewer years on average.', 'Bobby Kennedy Jr. understands this problem and wants to fix it. That is why he should be confirmed—even if we have our disagreements. And it is why President Donald Trump was right to pick someone with a vision to help the large coalition of Americans who want to reclaim their health.', 'Let’s build a world where Big Pharma can innovate to save Erick’s life, my life, and millions more lives. But also where we need those drugs a hell of a lot less often, where we can afford healthcare when we need it, and where we can do it without the force of government mandate. Let’s empower and inform people with science-based truth, and forge a new future. That’s how we “Make America Healthy Again.”', 'Chip Roy has served as the U.S. representative for Texas’s 21st Congressional District since 2019.', 'For another perspective, read Erick Erickson’s original op-ed to which this is a response: “Big Pharma Saved My Life.”']"

LANKFORD:', ""I do wanna talk to you about some areas that you and I have talked about, as well… we have some disagreements, you and I, on the issue of life and when life begins. You’ve been very outspoken on that, and we’ve had some good opportunities to be able to talk about that. Title 10 is specifically in the HHS area. This has been an area that has been interpreted for a long time and President Trump, in the first administration, interpreted that rule to say that his administration will prohibit the performance, referral for, promotion of abortion, as a part of the title 10 program -- he made that very clear in the first administration. Obviously, that’s his decision to make again on that, how he wants to handle that, and he’s made a lot of public statements on that. The Biden administration not only reversed that, not only rescinded that rule, but they went one step the other direction. In my state in Oklahoma, as you and I have talked about, the Biden administration cut off funding to the state of Oklahoma for AIDS testing, for breast cancer screening, and for other areas of poverty health care because my state didn't promote abortion. It wouldn't provide--if my state wouldn't promote abortion in the state, we got cut off for federal funds for AIDS testing, and for other things. My simple question to you is, how are you going to handle Title 10 on that? I saw how President Biden handled that, in the punitive measures that came on my state for those that are in rural healthcare. How are you going to handle it? "", ""KENNEDY: I'm going to support President Trump's policies on Title 10. I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy. I agree with him that we cannot be a moral nation if we have 1.2 million abortions a year. I agree with him that the states should control abortion. President Trump has told me that he wants to end late-term abortions, and he wants to protect conscience exemptions, and that he wants to end federal funding for abortions here or abroad, that's Title 10. I’m gonna--I serve at the pleasure of the president. I'm going to implement his policies.

There's a statement that's come out recently that he's going to reopen that office again to be able to protect the civil rights of Americans. One of the things that (former HHS Secretary) Xavier Becerra did immediately when he came into HHS was conscience protections for medical professionals that were being compelled against their conscience to perform medical procedures that violated their conscience. Xavier Becerra stepped in immediately into HHS and withdrew that. And said, 'no, the federal government will tell you what you believe about these issues, you don't have conscience protections anymore,' and refused to protect those folks. Will you step in and say that healthcare individuals have the right of conscience again as the federal law allows? "", ""KENNEDY: Yeah, I mean, the first thing that occurs to me when you ask that question is what patient would want somebody doing a surgery on them that, you know, believes that surgery is against their conscience being forced to perform that. I don't know anybody who would want to have that, have a doctor performing a surgery that the doctor is morally opposed to. Listen, I came from a family that was split on life and choice. I have cousins today who believe that abortion at any stage is equivalent to homicide. Now, there are other people who believe the opposite. But the good thing in my family that I really loved is that we were able to have those conversations and respect each other, and I wish that we could do that nationally. And, if forcing somebody to participate in a medical procedure as a provider that they believe is murder, does not make any sense to me. We need to welcome diversity in this country.

They changed the position and said don’t tell us if there’s a side effect on this drug unless she dies. But other than that, don’t tell us anymore--literally, don’t give transparent information to the American people or to the women who take this drug anymore, we don’t want that reported.

He indicated on Thursday he was ""struggling"" with the decision, but ultimately voted in Kennedy\'s favor.', 'Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, cast his Senate Finance Committee vote in favor of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, on Tuesday.

Sheldon Whitehouse, D.-R.I., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vt., who has agreed with Kennedy in the past about problems with the food industry.', 'Since Trump announced Kennedy\'s nomination, he\'s faced fierce opposition from the left. An ad campaign from the left-leaning advocacy group Protect Our Care targeted select Republican senators and portrayed Kennedy as an anti-vaccine extremist. He also faced opposition from the right because of his past support of abortion access — former Vice President Mike Pence\'s group Advancing American Freedom also ran ads against him. Thousands of physicians and scientists wrote letters opposing his nomination. Also, just before he was set to appear on Capitol Hill, his cousin Caroline Kennedy sent Senators a scathing letter about him, describing sordid acts and calling him a ""predator.""', 'Republican Senators were very friendly to Kennedy and his ideas during hearings last week, including those who are fervently opposed to abortion rights.

In exchange, Trump agreed to let Kennedy ""go wild on health"" and execute his vision.', 'In his confirmation hearings, Kennedy frequently referenced ""his generation"" — he was born in 1954 — describing how Americans were healthier back then and in the decades since the country\'s health had gone off track.', 'He frequently referenced data to support his arguments, but when confronted with data about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, Kennedy said he was unfamiliar with it. He said he was ""pro-safety"" and would change his position if he saw data that convinced him.

Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., called ""dangerous.""', 'One issue that arose during the confirmation process was his financial conflicts of interests. As someone who has made a fortune by suing vaccine makers, he could financially benefit from ongoing litigation while in charge of the federal agencies that regulate those drugmakers. Kennedy wrote in subsequent filings that he would transfer those interests to his son.

Kennedy Repeats False and Misleading Claims in Confirmation Hearing,https://www.factcheck.org/2025/01/kennedy-repeats-false-and-misleading-claims-in-confirmation-hearing/,"['By Jessica McDonald and Catalina Jaramillo', 'Posted on January 29, 2025', 'In his first Senate confirmation hearing to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. repeated claims we have written about before on vaccines and chronic disease.', 'Known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, including the debunked idea that they cause autism, Kennedy said in his opening remarks, “News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety.”', 'He has made similar statements recently. On Nov. 6, he told NPR that he wouldn’t take vaccines away, but wanted to “make sure that Americans have good information. Right now, the science on vaccine safety, particularly, has huge deficits in it, and we’re going to make sure those scientific studies are done and that people can make informed choices about their vaccinations and their children’s vaccinations.”', 'But, as we’ve explained, vaccine safety studies have been done and Americans do have access to that information. Multiple independent panels of scientists help review the data on each vaccine to make sure the benefits outweigh the risks. Several vaccine safety monitoring systems then watch for subsequent issues.', 'In December, Kennedy stepped down as chairman of Children’s Health Defense, a nonprofit he founded that has pushed false claims about vaccines.', 'If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee 13 agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. ', 'His Jan. 29 hearing was before the Senate Finance Committee. He will answer questions before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions on Jan. 30.', '(For more on Kennedy’s past claims, see our 2023 three-part series.)', 'When asked by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina if he was a conspiracy theorist, Kennedy said he has been labeled with the “pejorative” term “mainly to keep me from asking difficult questions of powerful interest.”  ', '“That label was applied to me because I said that the vaccines, the COVID vaccine, didn’t prevent transmission and it wouldn’t prevent infection when the government was telling people, Americans, that it would,” Kennedy said. “Now everybody admits it.”', 'Vaccines do not have to prevent infection to be effective — and many do not. The primary goal of many vaccines is to prevent disease, including severe disease, which is the main function of the COVID-19 vaccines.', 'The COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use based on their ability to reduce the risk of symptomatic disease in clinical trials. When the vaccines were authorized, the Food and Drug Administration warned that there was no “evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.” ', 'Yet, as we’ve explained, data showed that vaccination did reduce the spread of the disease, either because vaccinated people were protected against infection or because they were less contagious if infected. The emergence of more transmissible variants reduced the capacity of the vaccines to stop transmission, but they still provided some protection against infection and reduced the risk of severe disease. ', 'Kennedy often cites monkey studies published in 2020 when raising this issue, and he did so again during his confirmation hearing. But several early studies showed that vaccinated animals infected with the virus had lower levels of virus than infected unvaccinated animals.', '“I was called a conspiracy theorist because I said red dye caused cancer and now FDA has acknowledged that and banned it,” Kennedy continued at the hearing. “I was called a conspiracy theorist because I said fluoride lowered IQ. Last week JAMA published a meta review of 87 studies saying that there’s a direct inverse correlation between IQ lost.”', 'On Jan. 15, the FDA did revoke the authorization for the use of red dye No. 3, which is present in many foods and certain medications. But in doing so, the agency said claims that the use of the dye “puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.” The agency noted that the way that red dye causes cancer in rats “does not occur in humans.”  ', 'As for fluoride and IQ, as we’ve explained before, the data on water fluoridation and neurotoxicity is not 100% clear. Some research suggests that higher levels of fluoride are linked to decreases in children’s IQ but the evidence that this occurs at lower levels similar to what the U.S. recommends using in drinking water is much weaker and inconsistent.', 'The paper mentioned by Kennedy, a meta analysis of 74 studies published in JAMA Pediatrics on Jan. 6, has been described as controversial. Many of the included studies had a “high risk of bias,” the paper said, and none had been conducted in the U.S.', 'In September, a federal District Court judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must regulate fluoride in drinking water, saying that it “poses an unreasonable risk of reduced IQ in children.” The ruling added that “this finding does not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” ', 'As expected, Kennedy spoke repeatedly about the increase in chronic disease and his intention of ending what he describes as an “epidemic.” But he exaggerated the number of children affected by it. ', '“I was raised in a time where we did not have a chronic disease epidemic. When my uncle was president, 2% of American kids had chronic disease. Today, 66% have chronic disease,” he said.', 'Some chronic health conditions such as obesity, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and food allergies have been more commonly reported among children in the U.S. in recent decades. But as we’ve explained, experts say that Kennedy’s number of the percentage of kids with chronic disease, which he typically puts at 60%, is an overestimate.  ', 'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing data from the 2018 National Survey of Children’s Health, “more than 40% of school-aged children and adolescents have at least one chronic health condition such as asthma, obesity, other physical conditions, and behavior/learning problems.”', 'It is worth noting that there’s no data to compare today’s prevalence of chronic disease with that in the early 1960s, given changes in how chronic conditions are diagnosed, tracked and defined. And there is no standard definition today of what counts as a chronic condition. See our August story on this topic for more.', 'Early in the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, pushed back against Kennedy’s insistence in the hearing that he is not anti-vaccine by noting that in a podcast interview with Lex Fridman in July 2023, Kennedy said “no vaccine” is safe and effective.', 'Kennedy responded by telling Wyden that his description of what happened had been “repeatedly debunked” — and that Kennedy’s comment about vaccines “was a fragment of a statement” that occurred, because he had been cut off in the interview.', '“He asked me,” Kennedy said of Fridman, “‘Are there vaccines that are safe and effective?’ And I said to him, ‘Some of the live virus vaccines are.’ Then I said, ‘There are no vaccines that are safe and effective.’ And I was going to continue, ‘for every person.’” ', '“Every medicine has people who are sensitive to them, including vaccines,” Kennedy continued. “He interrupted me at that point. I have corrected it many times, including on national TV. You know about this, Sen. Wyden, so bringing this up right now is dishonest.”', 'But it hasn’t been debunked. And in fact, we’ve fact-checked Kennedy before on this very issue, when he falsely denied in a November 2023 “PBS NewsHour” interview that he ever said “no vaccine” is safe and effective during the podcast. In the PBS interview, he accused the interviewer of “making something up” and avoided answering whether he still thought there were no safe and effective vaccines.', 'In the hearing, Kennedy’s story about his podcast remarks has now shifted, but it’s difficult to reconcile his claim with what else was said on the podcast.', 'Fridman had asked Kennedy, “Can you name any vaccines that you think are good?” ', '“I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” Kennedy replied. “There’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” ', 'Kennedy finished the latter sentence in full. He then was about to say something else — perhaps an “in fact” — when Fridman stopped him to say that those were “big words — what about polio?” ', 'Given this additional time to expand on his comment, Kennedy proceeded to explain why, in his view, even the polio vaccine may have “caused more death than [it] averted.” (For that, Kennedy cited concerns about SV40 contamination of some polio vaccines in the 1960s possibly causing cancer. But there isn’t evidence that people receiving those vaccines were more likely to develop cancer.)', 'In a heated exchange, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado quizzed Kennedy on some of his past controversial and unsupported statements, including remarks during a press dinner in 2023, when he said, “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” His comments were made public by the New York Post. ', 'At the time, Kennedy said on the platform now known as X that he “never, ever suggested” that the virus “was targeted to spare Jews,” but that he had “accurately pointed out” that “governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons” and a study “shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races.” He also iterated that he did not think “the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered.”', 'During the hearing, when asked about those comments, Kennedy echoed this defense.', '“I didn’t say it was deliberately targeted,” Kennedy replied. “I just quoted an NIH-funded and NIH-published study.”', 'The study Kennedy cited, which did receive some NIH funding, was conducted by scientists at the Cleveland Clinic and published in BMC Medicine in 2020. As we have explained before, the results only “suggested possible associations” between certain gene variants and COVID-19 susceptibility, the study said. Even if validated, the effects would be small. An author of the paper also said the study’s findings “never supported” Kennedy’s claim. Racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths have not been shown to be explained by genetic differences.', 'Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination.

Later that same year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.', 'In sometimes heated exchanges during his hearings last week, Kennedy denied that he is anti-vaccine. But Kennedy, who pointed out that his children are vaccinated, acknowledged he has asked “uncomfortable questions” about vaccinations.', '“I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,” Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee.', 'Agriculture', 'Kennedy had previously promised a ban on corn syrup or pesticides. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions.', ""Kennedy indicated before the election that he would be keen to end the Food and Drug Administration's “aggressive suppression” of raw milk.

Kennedy has vowed to ban certain food additives and crack down on ultra-processed foods that are tied to obesity and diabetes rates."", 'In his hearings, Kennedy mentioned the number of ingredients in U.S. foods and suggested ultraprocessed foods are contributing to chronic disease.', '“We need to fix our food supply and that’s number 1,” he said.', 'Ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and more.', 'But those studies have shown associations, not causes, and experts say more research is needed to confirm exactly how these foods can lead to poor health outcomes.', 'Kennedy tried to assure senators that he would not seek widespread bans on vaccines or food, saying he wants to provide more information to people.', '“I don’t want to take food away from anybody,"" he said.

Kennedy Jr. to be the next secretary of health and human services.', 'On Sunday, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy quoted from the Bible’s Book of Joshua 10:25 on the X platform. “Joshua said to them, do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.”', 'Cassidy, a physician and vaccine advocate, had been the lone hope for a GOP vote against Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Senate Finance Committee, which would have blocked his nomination as Health and Human Services secretary.

One could hope he was praying for courage to vote against Kennedy with his Bible verse on Sunday.', 'It seems he was praying for the courage to ignore what he knows about Kennedy’s anti-vaccine, anti-science views and vote for him anyway. The pair had a testy set of exchanges in committees last week, leading some of us to hope Cassidy would oppose the nomination. “My responsibility is to learn—try and determine—if you can be trusted to support the best public health, a worthy movement called MAHA to improve the health of Americans, or to undermine it, always asking for more evidence and never accepting the evidence that is there,” he told Kennedy. He went on: “Does a 70-year-old man, 71-year-old man who spent decades criticizing vaccines, and who’s financially invested in finding fault with vaccines—can he change his attitudes and approach now that he’ll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?” Cassidy asked.', 'But on Monday morning, just before his vote, Cassidy posted something new on X—fealty to Trump and Kennedy. “I’ve had very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning. I want to thank VP JD [Vance] specifically for his honest counsel. With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes.”', 'Kennedy’s nomination headed to the full Senate on a strict 14–13 party-line committee vote.', 'Is there any hope that the full Senate will vote against Kennedy?

Kennedy Jr.'s to serve as President Trump's Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary to the Senate floor. The committee voted 14-13, with ...Show More"", '', '', '', '', '', ""Yes order We are meeting today to consider the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. We are still waiting to get all of our members here, and while we wait for that to occur, we will proceed with statements, and I will proceed first, then Senator Wyden, and then we will rotate from one side to the other until we are at a point where we're prepared for the vote. Does that fit with you, Senator? Mr. Kennedy, if confirmed, will have the opportunity to deliver much needed change to our nation's health care system. He has spent his career fighting to end America's chronic illness epidemic. And has been a leading advocate for health care transparency both for patients and for taxpayers. Mr. Kennedy has also clearly responded to our questions during the rigorous due diligence process in his hearing also and in the course of answering over 900 questions for the record that were asked by members of this committee. In response to members of the committee, Mr. Kennedy has even amended his ethics agreement going beyond what is required by the government Office of Ethics. Mr. Kennedy has proven his commitment to the role of Secretary of the HHS, and I will vote in favor of his nomination. I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same, and with that, I recognize our ranking member Senator Wyden, for his remarks. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'll have a brief statement and then several of my colleagues on our side are also going to make brief statements this morning. We're going to vote on Robert Kennedy's nomination to serve as our nation's chief healthcare officer. Before we get to Mr. Kennedy. And why I believe he is singularly unfit to serve as HHS Secretary, I'd like to say this. The last several days we've witnessed an authoritarian takeover of our federal government by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. They have set their sights on a full purge of anyone in government that doesn't bend the knee and follow their orders. They've taken over the Treasury Department's payment system. And colleagues that has a direct effect on major programs within our committee's jurisdiction that includes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. For example, this committee voted for a major reform of pharmacy benefit manager legislation. We passed it 26 to nothing, but Trump and Musk killed it. Think what they could do with abuse of the payment system. Now, in my view, much of this is a dubious legality and constitutional authority and certainly flies in the face of congressional responsibilities. I'll wrap up on this point by saying I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not sit by while Musk and Trump make a mockery of the power Republicans hold in their congressional majority. Now more than ever, the American people need leaders that will stand up to these abuses. That brings me to Mr. Kennedy. A recent analysis showed that Mr. Kennedy has made 114 separate appearances in just the last 4 years where he has espoused anti-vaccine views or spread information about the efficacy of vaccines. Misinformation specifically in 36 of those instances, Mr. Kennedy directly linked vaccines to autism. Last week, Mr. Kennedy was given ample authority on a bipartisan basis to recant his decades-long career peddling anti-vaccine conspiracies. Instead, He spent his time with us dodging and weaving and gave no indication that if confirmed as HHS secretary, he would stand by the long settled science surrounding routine vaccinations. Just take the Samoa measles outbreak as an example. Mr. Kennedy told me, and I quote, We don't know what was killing them. Speaking about the 83 measles deaths during an outbreak of the disease in 2019. Just yesterday, colleagues, the Director General of Health from Samoa called this claim a total fabrication. Peddling these conspiracy theories as the nation's chief health officer is going to be deadly for kids across the country. On abortion, Mr. Kennedy's answers once again raised still more questions. He refused to tell us whether he would blindly follow a directive from Donald Trump to break the law and end access to mifepristone. And he seemed to have no understanding of his role in enforcing existing federal laws that guarantee women the right to life saving abortion care. Mr. Kennedy also failed on several occasions to show a basic understanding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs he would be tasked with overseeing. Colleagues, that alone should be disqualifying. Mr. Kennedy has given us no reason to believe there'll be anything other than a rubber stamp for plans to gut Medicaid and rip health care away from the American people and be a yes man if ordered by Musk or Trump to take any illegal action. I close with this, colleagues. Today we're going to make a judgment about the future of science in this country. We're going to make decisions that are going to impact the health and well-being of Americans for years to come. I agree, and I say this to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that the healthcare status quo needs substantial changes, so we get better, more affordable care to patients. And that leaves, given my statement, the question in front of us now that's pretty simple. Do senators want their legacy to include disregarding basic health science and instead elevate conspiracy theorists? Making Robert Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services, in my view, colleagues, would be a grave threat to the health of the American people, and I urge my colleagues this morning to vote no. Yeah. So Senator Wyden, we have all of our members here. Senator Wyden and I have agreed that we will have 2 or 3 on each side who wanted to make statements, do so before the vote. So please everyone hold with us while we have those statements made, and then we will proceed to the vote. I know we've got a lot of folks here pushing on some. Do you want to vote now, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I've got several colleagues who were under the impression after we talked that we would have 2 or 3, and I'm happy for both sides to make brief remarks, and I'd still like to stay with that. I did make that commitment and so. I can say to my colleagues on my side, I would appreciate it if you would hold your remarks until after the vote. We will let a couple on your side have their remarks, and then we will proceed to the vote. Great, thank you. And who would be next? Senator Campwell, Senator Campwell,"", ""Mr. Chairman, thank you. I didn't, you know, when you said 2 or 3 people, I didn't know who you had in mind, but being next in seniority, I appreciate the opportunity. Uh, today is very concerning to me because of the future of what I think our nation faces. When I think of this issue, I think of my Pacific Northwest leadership, how Paul Allen on his own invested $100 million to fight Ebola. I think of Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation, not just trying to eradicate polio and work on these issues, but to think of a regime that helps not just our nation's health but global health. So with the UW, the University of Washington, the Cancer Research Center, all of these entities are a collaboration of saying we have to go faster in solving these threats to our nation as it relates to health. Now we can have a big discussion which I think you guys all want to have a big discussion about whether and when what happened in the Wuhan province, but I can tell you we were the first city. We had the first patient, we had the first people who died in nursing homes. We had an emergency room at a hospital who basically was just begging for any equipment we could get them. The whole community stood up and moved as fast as we possibly could and broke down barriers to save lives, and that is what we have to continue to do on innovation. We cannot let another country get ahead of us on some sort of warfare issue and not have a response when it comes to a vaccine, so. The most challenging, I wanted to vote for Mr. Kennedy in the context of my family's history. My dad stood behind his father the night his father gave the famous speech. I told him in my office, in my family, the Kennedys stood up. But when he answered Senator Cassidy's question, And he couldn't even give him the answer that yes, the data is there to support vaccines today. I don't need any more data. All of a sudden I saw this world that we got affected by in Seattle. Not being stood up for. I need someone at HHS who is going to say we're going to be a leader in medical technology, science, vaccines. We are going to fight foreign powers. We are going to be there to provide global health, and I don't want to recalcitrant. I need a leader, and that is why I'm voting no."", ""Thank you, Senator Wyden and I have agreed that Senator Warnock will now speak following Senator Warnock. We will proceed to the vote and then anyone else who wants to make remarks will be allowed to make remarks. Senator Warnock, thank you so very much, Mr. Chairman. At a rally a few months ago, Donald Trump said that he was going to allow Mr. Robert Kennedy to go wild on health. Go wild. Of all the things that I can think of that I'd like to see a Secretary of Health and Human Services do, go wild is not on the list. Mr. Robert Kennedy is manifestly unqualified. For the job he seeks. And in both my live and written questions for the record, he failed to commit to protecting access to affordable health care. Failed to commit to protecting the people who are protecting us. The problem that the CDC has is that every day these noble civil servants and workers protect us from dangers that we don't see. And often you don't get credit for protecting people from things that they don't see. I simply do not trust him. To oversee the CDC. He's unqualified, and I dare say everybody here knows it. We need a serious person. At the helm of the HHS. An agency responsible for about half of the health, the health of about half of all Americans. Mr. Kennedy appears more obsessed. In chasing conspiracy theories than chasing solutions to lower health care costs for working families in Georgia. And to make sure that we are protected, the last thing we need is a dilettante. Dabbling in conspiracy theories. At HHS, I cannot vote for a nominee who is not going to lower health care costs for Georgians, who's going to undermine basic science in public health, who puts his own interests above the health and the well-being of others. For the health and well-being of all of our families, the people who count on us. To think about them in these rooms of power. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. To look past politics and think of country. And to find the moral courage. To do what's right. Oppose this nomination. Thank you, Senator Warnock. We now have not only a quorum, but all members of the committee are present. I move that the committee favorably report the nomination of the Honorable Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of California to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. Is there a second? There is a 2nd. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. Grassley. Mr. Grassley, I, Mr. Cornyn.

Mr. Chairman, the final was 14 ayes, 13 nays. The vote was 14 to 13. The nomination is reported favorably. We will now turn to other senators who would like to make a statement. Since I asked my Republican colleagues to hold off at the outset, I'll go to the Republican side next. First, Senator Tillis, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I voted aye today, and I want to just briefly explain why. I believe in my 65 years, I'll be 65 in August. that Mr. Kennedy will be one of the first people coming before who is in fact not a trained health care expert. He views this through the lens of an attorney. He's brought many lawsuits on food safety, vaccine safety, a number of other things. But Mr. Chair, I think it was Senator Warnock that said that the president said he was going to go wild in the Department of Health and Human Services. I hope he does. I hope he goes wild and actually finds a way to reduce the cost of health care. I hope he goes wild and instead of having the discussions that we have had for the 10 years that I've been in the Senate of making Medicaid work and making people on Medicaid healthier, I hope he goes wild and figures out how to do it because the status quo has not achieved much in the way of gain. I hope he goes wild on food safety discussions so that we can actually improve our food safety. supply. I hope he goes wild on the health care supply chains and in fact tries to make sure that drug prices go down instead of bludgeoning pharmaceutical companies, get everybody in the room and make sure that we do this right, reduce the cost of bringing a vaccine to market, reduce the cost of bringing drugs and therapeutics to. Market, look at the full supply chain and somebody with a legal mind may do that. He is no health professional. In fact, he's the first, I believe, and since I've been alive, who's not been a health care professional in a scientific sense, but he is a professional in terms of carrying this forward and holding people accountable through the courts. But and also, Mr. Chair, I'm not going to go much longer. But I had a lot of people call me earlier. I had people from the agriculture industry call me and expressed concerns, but I'm not aware of any organized credible group, the Farm Bureau, the Department of commissioners, or others who have said that we should vote against Mr. Kennedy. I heard people express their concerns about his pro-choice position, and yet I haven't seen any pro-life organization score this vote or recommend that we should vote against it. I heard him call the NRA a terrorist organization, and yet the NRA is silent on his confirmation. And so I've heard him say that, you know, GMOs are a concern. Hopefully we can convince him that not all GMOs are. It's feeding the world. Corn, drought resistant strains of healthy vegetables will move on. Protein producers were mad about lawsuits were brought against them, but there's been no organized opposition against them. And so maybe it is time to have a different kind of disruptor there. The only way that Senator Kennedy, I'm sorry, Senator Kennedy, the only way that Bobby Kennedy and I will get crosswise is if he, if he does actually take a position against the safety of proven vaccines. That will be a problem for me. He answered a very important question to me during the during the hearing. I asked him specifically. If it was his intent to let the scientists of the CDC, the NIH, BARTA, and other organizations to work independently, he said to me under oath that he would if he fails to do that, that will be a concern for me and something I'll bring up in a future oversight hearing. But Mr. Chair, we have not made appreciable progress in Medicaid and improving the health of the population, the health of the population on Medicaid. We have a SNAP program that does have too much sugar and things that are eligible in that program that should be eliminated to make these people who are on free and reduced lunch healthier. We need to stop having full trash cans in public school cafeterias full of stuff that the kids aren't eating and figure out how those kids on free and reduced lunch actually have a healthier lifestyle. And so I for one think that it is time to put a disrupter in. It is time to put somebody in there that's going to go wild. But there are areas where I think that's exactly what we need, and there are areas of health and human services that if you touch the gold standard for the NIH and the CDC, then I'll have a problem with that nominee, and we'll bring that up during an oversight. But it was for those reasons and and the fact is that there's not a single organization that I consider to be credible in this space in agriculture, in Second Amendment, or in pro-life who have openly objected and scored this vote. I believe that silence is consent, and the fact that they haven't suggests to me that folks that I'm instructed by are OK with this nomination, and for those reasons I voted for Mr. Kennedy. Thank you, Senator Tillis. Senator Warren, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since we had our hearing last week, Mr. Kennedy has amended his ethics agreement. Recall that his ethics agreement said that while he was Secretary of HHS, he intended to retain a financial interest in ongoing vaccine litigation that he was already collecting money from. And that he wanted to continue to collect that money even though he could affect the outcome of that litigation. Now he has since changed his position on that. He, once this has been exposed and people have talked about it and have some pretty serious reservations about his doing that, he has said that he will instead give his financial interests to his son. That is a fig leaf that is so small, it would take a magnifying glass to see it. No one is fooled about what's happening here. Mr. Kennedy refuses to say. That he will not participate in these lawsuits financially the day after he leaves office. And yet Mr. Kennedy has acknowledged first that the American people have a right to know that the decisions you're making are decisions that are in their interest, not in your future financial interest. He has said he thinks that's the right standard and Yet he has figured out how to make money off his anti-vax positions. He's already raked in $2.5 million. He is in a position where he can affect the outcomes by things he does as Secretary of HHS, and yet he refuses to say that he will delay by even a day taking on anti-vax lawsuits the minute he leaves. That is an appalling conflict of interest, and it's one in which the American people can reasonably ask, Is Mr. Kennedy's plan to help the American people, or is he planning to use this job to further enrich himself and he's pointed out with his son, and enrich his family. The importance of this litigation cannot be overstated. This is not only about a private company that gets sued and has to pay out. Vaccine manufacturers often operate on very slim profit margins. If they get sued repeatedly and successfully. They simply move out of the vaccine space. We've already seen this happen with vaccines in the past. 20 years ago we watched vaccines just move away if they did not have protection from these kinds of lawsuits. The consequence of Mr. Kennedy's ability to make those lawsuits easier is also the ability to shut down access and manufacturing for vaccines for every one of us, and I think that's a terrible mistake. Thank you, Senator Welch. Did you wish to speak? I did. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and thank you, Mr. Ranking Member for your statement. I want a disruptor in the healthcare system and one leading it. I don't want a destroyer. And there's 3 issues before any nominee that we have to consider. One is character, another is confidence, and the third is priorities. We did not have Caroline Kennedy here, but she gave a statement, and she said that Bobby was able to attract people through the strength of his personality, his willingness to take risks and break the rules. And those might be desirable qualities if it was accompanied by sober judgment and behavior because the person who leads a major organization has to have the confidence of the people that work for him. And frankly some of the things that he did that never explained a chainsaw taken off the head of a whale. A dumping a bear in Central Park for his own amusement. These are just weird things, and we never really got into the character issue of what is required for a person who runs such a major department. The competence question, this is all on a wing and a prayer and a hope. There's no record of Mr. Kennedy having experience in managing a large organization in, in medicine, no experience with science, and none of the prior experiences required not only to run a major organization, Health and Human Services. But also the CDC, the NIH, and all the other organizations that are under the umbrella of health care. And by the way, on the confidence issue, let's be candid. This was a deal where Mr. Kennedy was running for president as a Democrat. He lost and he approached President Trump to make a deal and for political reasons, the deal was made and the appointment was going to be that he's Health and Human Services. The president has a right to make that deal. Mr. Kennedy can seek it, but it doesn't translate into confidence. And the third is priorities. The priority for Mr. Kennedy is about the vaccines and his theory of that, and we need reliable vaccines and not a conspiracy theorists on that. But you know, the health care system is not working for the American people. It is too costly. It's too costly. Our employers who care deeply about providing employer sponsored health care can't afford these premiums. The folks who are getting their insurance on their own can't afford it. Even Obamacare is getting so expensive because the prices are escalating constantly. With farm expenses with the providers having it with private equity getting into health care, Mr. Kennedy's priority was about his view of vaccines. It was not about making health care more affordable and accessible. And in response to really a very direct and easy open-ended question from Senator Cassidy, Mr. Kennedy showed a woeful ignorance even between the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. So we have a health care system that is not serving as it should the interests of American citizens, of American businesses, and American taxpayers, and I, after this hearing, did not have confidence that Mr. Kennedy would be the one to lead us to a better future. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Welch. That concludes the remarks that senators have requested to make, and hearing nothing further. I'd like to thank all of our members for attending.

"The Junk Science of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-junk-science-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr,"['For the first time in modern American history, a skeptic of medical research could be responsible for safeguarding public health.', 'In the fading days of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,’s independent campaign for President, he found himself on the phone with Donald Trump, a man he once privately described as “a terrible human being.” Trump had nearly been killed by an assassin’s bullet at a Pennsylvania rally, an act that hit close to home for Kennedy, whose father was assassinated on the Presidential campaign trail. Hours after the shooting, Kennedy went on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, saying that Trump’s “courage” that day was “inspirational.” Soon, he and Trump were chatting about their vaccine skepticism. In a video of the call that Kennedy’s son posted online, Trump can be heard telling Kennedy, “I would love you to do stuff, and I think it would be so good for you, and so big for you, and we’re going to win.” Not long after, I spoke with Kennedy’s campaign manager, his daughter-in-law Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, who told me that, if Kennedy were to drop out of the race and endorse Trump, the idea of Kennedy becoming Secretary of Health and Human Services in Trump’s Administration would be “an incredibly interesting one.”', 'At the time, the suggestion seemed almost risible. For the past two decades, Kennedy has positioned himself as an American royal turned health crusader, fighting government and corporate powers that, he believes, have routinely lied to the American public about vaccines, food, and water safety. “This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country,” Kennedy said in 2015 about vaccines’ supposed ill effects on children. He has suggested that chemicals in tap water could alter children’s gender and sexual identities, and said that covid was “targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people” and that “the people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” Even after Kennedy backed Trump, he didn’t seem particularly well positioned. In October, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s transition team co-chair, said on CNN that Kennedy’s “not getting a job for H.H.S.” Two weeks later, Trump nominated Kennedy to head the department.', 'On Wednesday, Kennedy will appear at a Senate hearing that will determine whether he is confirmed. The moment is seismic, both in the arc of Kennedy’s personal story—he has long believed in his destiny for greater things—and in American life. For the first time, a skeptic of science could sit at the head of one of the nation’s critical posts, responsible for safeguarding public health.', 'The Department of Health and Human Services has an enormous budget, projected to be $1.8 trillion in 2025, and includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. It also oversees the administration of Medicare and Medicaid, and is, through the National Institutes of Health, which has a budget of more than forty-seven billion dollars, one of the largest funders of medical and behavioral research in the world. The department’s remit is sprawling—it helps resettle refugees, houses detained undocumented minors, and administers funds to impoverished families with children—all with the goal of enhancing the “health and well-being of all Americans.”', 'Many of the H.H.S.’s priorities are oriented around preventing infectious disease through research and public-health outreach. Kennedy is particularly skeptical of these programs; in 2023, he told a crowd that, if elected President, he would tell N.I.H. scientists, “We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” Kennedy’s underlying suspicion of mainstream medical researchers stems from his decades of vaccine skepticism. In 2005, he wrote an article co-published by Rolling Stone and Salon in which he misrepresented the transcript of a meeting of doctors in order to support his thesis that they were conspiring with the pharmaceutical industry to push unsafe vaccines. (The article was later retracted by Salon and removed from both publications’ Web sites.) A decade ago, he began working with what was then a small anti-vaccine group, now called Children’s Health Defense, which Kennedy helped turn into a misinformation juggernaut. According to reporting by the New York Times, during the rollout of covid-19 vaccines, in 2021, Kennedy officially petitioned the F.D.A. to rescind its authorization, an episode that raises questions about how Kennedy might act in the event of a pandemic on his watch. The scenario is far from hypothetical; there has been recent alarm in the scientific community about the potential spread of bird flu to humans.', 'Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism might not only hamper the country’s defenses against a new pandemic but could also allow the recirculation of diseases once believed to be under control. The Times reported that one of Kennedy’s close advisers, Aaron Siri, filed a petition to the F.D.A. in 2022 asking that approval for the polio vaccine be revoked. (In response, Kennedy’s spokesperson said in a statement, “The polio vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied.”) As the H.H.S. Secretary, Kennedy would have the authority to appoint members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which helps the C.D.C. issue recommendations to states and insurers about which vaccines to cover. Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of H.H.S. under Barack Obama, has said that this is where Kennedy could wield great power. “He could make very strong recommendations to states that they grant far more exemptions to parents, so, greatly increase the number of children who could qualify to go to school without vaccines,” she said on a recent podcast. “He could encourage states to just make [vaccines] optional.”', 'Kennedy would also make serious changes to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the so-called vaccine court, which is under the jurisdiction of the H.H.S. The vaccine court was created in the nineteen-eighties, after lawsuits against vaccine makers threatened to cause shortages of the drugs and reduce vaccination rates; its intent was to cap compensation claims and limit the liability of drugmakers. But the H.H.S. Secretary has the power to remove vaccines from the vaccine court’s purview. If Kennedy did so, it could lead to drastic price hikes for key vaccines as pharmaceuticals looked to cover their potential risks. In some instances, Kennedy’s past advocacy work could create potential conflicts of interest. As Reuters reported earlier this month, Kennedy is a lawyer for California lawsuits against the makers of Gardasil, the H.P.V. vaccination; the plaintiffs are alleging that the drug was fraudulently marketed, a strategy that seems aimed at avoiding vaccine court.', 'Under Kennedy, the H.H.S. would likely be more oriented toward fighting chronic disease, which, on the campaign trail, he called an “existential” threat to the country. Many of Kennedy’s assertions on the issue are backed up by data: forty-two per cent of American adults have obesity, an estimated 11.6 per cent have diabetes, and heart disease is the country’s leading cause of death. In particular, Kennedy has railed against ultra-processed food and the complicity of the American regulatory system in allowing harmful substances into our diets. “There are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the F.D.A. . . . that have to go, that are not doing their job,” Kennedy said recently. Earlier this month, the F.D.A. outlawed red dye No. 3 in food, which had been linked to cancer in lab rats; Kennedy has been a proponent of a total ban on synthetic food dyes.', 'Like many prominent figures in the wellness movement, however, Kennedy has also advocated for dubious solutions to the chronic-disease crisis. He is a proponent of using beef tallow over seed oils such as corn and canola. Last October, in a post on X that depicted his father, Robert F. Kennedy, eating a hamburger, Kennedy wrote that “seed oils are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic.” Most experts say that seed oils are not a serious health risk. Kennedy has also said that he wants to end the F.D.A.’s “aggressive suppression” of, among other things, raw milk—which can carry pathogens, including bird flu—and the use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, two discredited supposed treatments for covid-19.', 'Kennedy’s enthusiasm for dietary health has earned him some plaudits from Democrats. Senator Bernie Sanders told CBS in December that “what he’s saying about the food industry is exactly correct. I think you have a food industry concerned about their profits, could care less about the health of the American people. I think they have to be taken on.” Colorado Governor Jared Polis sent a congratulatory tweet after Kennedy was nominated, saying that Kennedy would “help make America healthy again by shaking up H.H.S. and F.D.A.” But Kennedy has suggested that his project to reverse the obesity and chronic-disease epidemic would have to be undertaken at the expense of other research. In the wake of Trump’s election, for example, Kennedy said that Trump should fire and replace six hundred N.I.H. employees immediately upon taking office.', 'Kennedy’s confirmation remains an uncertainty. He has raised suspicions among some Republican senators with his past support for reproductive rights; others remain concerned about his stances on vaccines. In December, Senator Mitch McConnell, a childhood survivor of polio, issued a public statement in support of the polio vaccine. “Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed—they’re dangerous,” he said. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician, said on Fox News that Kennedy was “wrong” about vaccines. But Kennedy has been meeting with senators of both parties. Senator John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, recently appeared on “The View,” where he declined to share how he might vote on Kennedy’s nomination. “We, just like all of you, are going to watch the hearings and see how things go,” he said.', 'It’s likely to be an eventful process. Kennedy has a long history of drug abuse, infidelity, and the questionable disposal of animal carcasses. On Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, submitted a searing statement to senators pleading that they deny her cousin the Cabinet post: “He lacks any relevant government, financial, management, or medical experience. His views on vaccines are dangerous and willfully misinformed. These facts alone should be disqualifying. But he has personal qualities related to this job which, for me, pose even greater concerns.” With a reference to Kennedy’s longtime passion for falconry, Caroline added, “I’ve known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together. It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because Bobby himself is a predator. . . .  I watched his younger brothers and cousins follow him down the path of drug addiction. His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were always the center of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.” ♦', 'Has an old Soviet mystery finally been solved?', 'Why the rules of mustard and spaghetti sauce don’t apply to ketchup.', 'How the Unabomber avoided the death penalty.', 'The actress who magnified her celebrity by suddenly renouncing it.', 'The shareable feast of Jeremy Allen White’s Calvin Klein ad.', 'Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: “Girl”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

It Took RFK Jr. Just Six Minutes to Lie to Congress,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-vaccines/,"['David Corn', '', 'Six minutes into his opening statement at his confirmation hearing Wednesday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lied. President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services brazenly repeated a statement that has been cited as false multiple times.\n\n“News reports claim I am anti-vaccine…I am not,” he said in his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee.', 'At that, a protester in the audience, shouted, “You lie.” She was removed from the hearing room by Capitol Hill police.', 'The protester was right. In July 2023, Kennedy told a podcaster, “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.” That same month, during an interview on Fox News with Jesse Watters, Kennedy said, “I do believe that autism comes from vaccines.” That notion has long been scientifically debunked. In 2021, he told a podcaster that people should “resist” guidelines from the Centers for Disease and Control on vaccines. He added, “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated.” And the non-profit that he led promoted an anti-vaccine campaign with the slogan, “IF YOU’RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN’T PAYING ATTENTION.”', 'And then there are all the anti-vax books he has written that certainly convey the impression that vaccines are dangerous.', 'Yet at the hearing, Kennedy tried to run from his past. He claimed that when it comes to vaccines he was merely “pro-safety” and only has asked “uncomfortable questions.” He said that vaccines play a “critical role in health care” and noted that “all my kids are vaccinated.”', 'Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, was determined not to let Kennedy slip by with his Big Lie about vaccines. He cited several of Kennedy’s past remarks. Referring to Kennedy’s comment that his kids were vaccinated, Wyden noted that during a 2020 podcast interview, Kennedy said he “would do anything, pay anything, to go back in time and not vaccinate” his kids.', 'Kennedy tried to weasel his way out, claiming that no vaccine is safe and effective “for everyone.” But that’s obvious, given that all vaccines can have adverse reactions. He did not bother to counter the other comments that Wyden referenced. He also dodged questions about the assertion in a 2021 book he wrote that parents have been misled to believe measles is a deadly disease and that the measles vaccine is safe and necessary. When Wyden asked whether measles is deadly, Kennedy refused to provide a yes or no answer. But he told the committee that he supports the measles and polio vaccines. Wyden scoffed at this remark.', 'Kennedy had to call on his powers of slipperiness to duck tough questions. Asked about the petition he filed in May 2021 with the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the authorization for the Covid vaccine and to block future access to it, he said he had only been focused on the use of vaccines for six-year-old children. That was highly misleading. Kennedy’s request to the FDA claimed the vaccine’s costs outweighed the benefits for everyone, not just children.', 'Kennedy’s penchant for sidestepping was on continuous display through the morning. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), asked him about a bonkers comment pertaining to Covid he uttered in 2023: “Covid-19. There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. Covid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately. Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” This remark had been widely interpreted as antisemitic and suggestive that the Covid was designed as bioweapon that would spare certain people.', 'Kennedy responded that he had not said “deliberately targeted”—and this silly dodge provoked laughter from the crowd. He said he had been merely referring to an NIH study. Bennet did not have the time during his five-minute allotment to look this up. But that NIH study—which Kennedy did not mention when he made those remarks in 2023—did not say this virus was designed to target certain demographic groups. It only noted that “genetic factors” might play a role in how the disease affects people.', 'This was classic Kennedy: Cite an informative-sounding source that does not actually say what he claims it says. In this instance, he had implied that Covid was a bioweapon, as he has said about other diseases, including Lyme disease. He had no proof for this—as with many of his conspiratorial claims—but when called out at this hearing he pointed to a study that does not confirm his outlandish allegation. Kennedy’s mastery of this methodology, when applied to issues of life-and-death, makes him a potentially dangerous appointment.', 'When Kennedy was asked by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the committee chair, if anything in his background “might present a conflict of interest,” he said no. That was misleading. In his financial disclosure filing, Kennedy revealed that he has earned millions of dollars by referring clients to personal injury law firms suing Merck in various courts on behalf of people who received HPV vaccines—which studies show help prevent cervical cancer. Despite his nomination, he indicated he plans to keep receiving fees from those lawsuits. That means he could receive a large sum if Merck loses the cases or settles them, a prospect that Kennedy, if confirmed, could potentially influence.', 'Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pressed Kennedy on his financial stake in these lawsuits. Would Kennedy agree, she asked, not to pocket any money from these cases when he is secretary and for four years afterward? “There is a lot of ways that you could influence those future lawsuits and pending lawsuits,” Warren said, noting that Kennedy as HHS secretary could impact cases by publishing anti-vaccine claims in official government reports or by sharing FDA data with lawyers bringing the suits. Kennedy did not agree to eschew money from these lawsuits. Instead, he repeatedly misconstrued Warren’s request. “You are asking me not to sue vaccine companies,” Kennedy said. That was not what she was asking.', 'It was clear throughout the first hours of the hearing that none of Kennedy’s falsehoods and misrepresentations mattered to the Republican members of the committee. He was not meaningfully challenged by any of them. That was not surprising, for, as Kennedy displayed thoroughly, when it comes to adhering to the truth, his record on this front is similar to that of the fellow looking to hire him.', '', '', 'Mother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Sowing doubt about vaccines has earned him millions — and could keep paying out.', 'by Dylan Scott', 'Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to be Donald Trump’s health secretary has been dogged by his long record of anti-vaccine and anti-science statements. Even as Republicans embrace him as an iconoclast, Democrats and other critics have lambasted Kennedy as a know-nothing without the scientific or bureaucratic experience to do the job effectively.', 'But in painting Kennedy as a clown, those criticisms miss something important. Kennedy has not only gained a public following for his outlandish claims, he has also made a lot of money broadcasting them. And he could stand to make more from his anti-vaccine crusade as America’s top health official — the kind of brazen self-dealing that’s become all but normalized in Trump’s America.', 'As the New York Times reported last week, Kennedy has referred potential plaintiffs — people who say they have been injured by vaccines — to the law firm Wisner Baum, which is suing Merck over alleged harm related to the HPV vaccine. (He has also been involved in other cases for the firm.) Wisner Baum pays Kennedy for these referrals, in the vaccine case and other cases: He’s earned more than $2.5 million over the past two years, the Times reported. When the lawsuit concludes, if the vaccine manufacturer loses, Kennedy will get a financial reward.', 'At the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing Wednesday on Kennedy’s nomination, Kennedy refused to say that he would end the relationship with Wisner Baum during a line of questioning by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).', 'After affirming Kennedy would not accept drug company money as health secretary, Warren asked if Kennedy would likewise commit not to take money from lawsuits against drug companies, under his arrangement with Wisner Baum.', '“You’re making me sound like a shill,” Kennedy replied, before deflecting Warren’s question with an excuse he repeated more than once: “You’re asking me to not sue drug companies.”', 'Warren then ran through the various ways Kennedy could influence the outcome of those lawsuits while serving as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. He could publish anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, she said, “this time on US government letterhead.” He could appoint anti-vaccine scientists to federal vaccine panels and remove vaccines from the federally recommended schedule of childhood vaccines. He could even give FDA data, Warren said, to the law firm that sues the drug companies and compensates him for their wins.', 'Given another opportunity by Warren, Kennedy again declined to commit to removing his financial stake from the anti-vaccine litigation. Instead, a few minutes later, he claimed that he had been unfairly maligned as a conspiracy theorist because he opposed powerful corporate interests — the same kind of misdirection that has fueled his ascent toward the top of US health policy, while providing cover for his actual conflicts of interest.', '“No one should be fooled here,” Warren said. “As secretary of HHS, Robert Kennedy will have the power to undercut vaccines and vaccine manufacturing across our country ... Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions. Kids might die, but Kennedy can keep cashing in.”', 'Despite all this, the Senate appears on track to approve his nomination, at least so far. Kennedy will testify at the Senate health committee on Thursday.', 'The second Trump term is shaping up to be even less constrained by the old norms of good governance, which prize the avoidance of any perception that a public official could profit from their role. In that respect, Kennedy is much like Trump himself: His risible public statements, designed to draw a spectacle, can distract from any old-fashioned corruption happening behind the scenes.', 'Over the last 30 years, vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the US alone. Over the same period, they’ve also saved Americans $540 billion in direct health care costs and trillions in social costs by preventing illnesses like polio and measles.', 'Kennedy has spent decades spreading anti-vaccination pseudoscience, and the organization he leads, Children’s Health Defense, has been one of the foremost anti-vaccine advocacy groups in the US and abroad. As part of his disclosures as a Cabinet nominee, Kennedy reported millions of dollars in income from book deals and speaking engagements that have resulted from his public profile, on top of his income from Wisner Baum.', 'There have been serious health consequences from Kennedy’s anti-vaccine campaign as well. His support of an anti-vaccine group in American Samoa helped fuel a wave of vaccine hesitancy in the island nation; a 2019 measles epidemic killed 83 people there, most of them children.', 'During Wednesday’s hearing, when criticized about his involvement by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Kennedy insisted he played no role in the outbreak and even alleged that many of the people had not actually died from measles. (The deaths were reported by the WHO as related to measles, and measles continues to kill 100,000 people globally every year.) He also refused to answer a question from Wyden about whether measles was a deadly disease.', 'Kennedy has espoused other conspiracy-laden ideas about health: He says fluoride is “industrial waste” linked to a range of diseases, and suggested it should be removed from all US water systems. He has speculated that gender dysphoria may result from herbicide exposure and implied mass shootings are linked to antidepressants.', 'These views have angered scientists, but they also helped fuel the burgeoning Make America Healthy Again movement. There is now an ecosystem of influencers and companies trying to make money by pitching themselves, like Kennedy, as alternatives to the conventional pharmaceutical and wellness industries.', 'In one of the hearing’s more remarkable moments, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) asked Kennedy about his baseless beliefs in a series of rapid-fire questions. Bennet pressed Kennedy about his past claims that Lyme disease was “highly likely” to have been engineered by the military. “I probably did say that,” Kennedy allowed.', 'Despite Kennedy’s long history of anti-vaccine rhetoric, he said before the election and again at the hearing that he wasn’t planning to take anyone’s vaccines away. “I support the polio vaccine. I support the measles vaccine,” he said in his exchange with Warren. This is despite his long record of public statements disparaging vaccines, including casting doubt on the necessity of the measles shot, suggesting the disease could be cured by chicken soup instead.', 'However, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team had said just a week earlier that Kennedy hoped to access federal health data with the goal of proving vaccines are unsafe and pulling them from the US market.', 'And if, under Kennedy, the federal government starts to say vaccines are unsafe, that could provide the basis for more vaccine lawsuits — and potentially more income for Kennedy. His refusal to say he’d withdraw from that conflict of interest is telling, and heightens those fears: Warren gave him an easy out to commit to good government principles. He refused to take it.', 'In addition to the possibilities Warren floated, there are various ways Kennedy could sow doubts about vaccine safety: He could resuscitate HHS’s National Vaccine Program Office, which monitored vaccine safety with particular rigor but was shuttered during the first Trump presidency.', 'As health secretary, he would also oversee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is housed under HHS. That agency has two important roles in promoting vaccines in the US: It convenes an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to provide expert recommendations on who should get which vaccines and at which age, and it administers the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free vaccines for millions of children in low-income families.', 'The advisory committee is not mandated by federal law — it is convened only because the CDC has historically wanted it to be. A vaccine skeptic appointed to run the CDC could either staff the committee with anti-vaccination activists or dissolve it entirely, further eroding the public’s faith in vaccines and potentially providing more fuel to anti-vaccine litigation.', 'Having a president and HHS secretary so openly hostile to the US public health establishment is unprecedented. Already, as vaccination rates nationwide slip, the US is seeing more outbreaks of measles and other diseases that had previously been stamped out by vaccines. Normally, we would expect the nation’s top health care official to marshal any resources necessary to prevent such outbreaks. But Kennedy has a financial as well as an ideological stake in denying vaccines’ effectiveness and safety.

For them, each new vaccine increased the chance that theirs would be the first generation that didn’t expect to bury a child.

As a pediatrician, I see vaccines as a force field that we and parents use to protect young lives.', 'As a pediatrician, I see vaccines as a force field that we and parents use to protect young lives.', 'During medical school and then a residency at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, I cared for countless infants and children hospitalized with bacterial meningitis and invasive diseases caused by pathogens like Hemophilus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria. These infections often resulted in devastating damage, such as hearing and vision loss — a fate Helen Keller tragically suffered. Then, a spinal tap was a necessary and routine part of the workup of infant fever. The high-pitched, painful cries of infants with meningitis will forever reverberate in my mind, along with the coughs of infants with pertussis drowning in their own secretions.', 'During my 30 years as a physician, I have seen how our carefully studied vaccines have revolutionized pediatric care. Because the vast majority of young Americans are vaccinated, bacterial meningitis and its devastating effects have become so rare that only the youngest infants now require invasive procedures like spinal taps during fever workups. In the vaccinated, Pneumococcus rarely causes bloodstream infections or the deadly pneumonia for which it is named. We no longer see the chickenpox infections that result in weeks of missed school and work. Hemophilus isn’t causing the loss of limbs, eyes and airways.', 'This progress, however, is being threatened by vaccine refusal. As Kennedy sat before a confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday, physicians like me, who’ve dedicated our lives to the health and welfare of children, watched with outrage and exhaustion. And disgust that Kennedy refused to own his anti-vaccine advocacy.', '“I support the measles vaccine,” he told senators. “I support the polio vaccine. I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking anything.” But the fact is that he has built a name for himself by discouraging parents from getting their children vaccinated.', 'As Kennedy sat for a confirmation hearing, physicians who’ve dedicated our lives to the health and welfare of children, watched with outrage.', 'Listening, I thought about the father who recently became angry with me for “insinuating” that his sick, unvaccinated infant needed a workup and hospitalization for his high fever without an obvious source. He accused me of making up concerns to make money for the hospital. As familiar as I am with this particular conspiracy theory, it hits me hard every time I hear it. And we are hearing it more and more often.', 'Instead of becoming defensive and judgmental, I treat these bedside conversations as a collaboration that has as its common goal a healthy child.  I talk about my own experience, painting a picture of the wards from as recently as the 1990s. I told this father that I understood he was acting as an advocate for his child the best way he knew how. Ultimately, his wife heard me and agreed to the workup. By the time their child’s blood culture grew Pneumococcus the next day, their child was already getting his third dose of intravenous antibiotics.', 'After he was recovered, the mother described the near-tragedy on social media. She shared how worried they’d been and how they initially hadn’t sought care because they didn’t trust hospitals. She added that if her children had received their routine vaccines, then their infant son probably would have experienced Pneumococcus as nothing more than a mild fever or ear infection. And they’d have been spared a hospital bill.', 'The flames of vaccine hesitancy have been stoked to a bonfire by fictitious stories by self-serving individuals. When Andrew Wakefield first theorized that the measles vaccine caused autism, he may have truly believed that. But by the time more complete and accurate research showed no connection, his taste of fame and the power of sensationalism had seemingly overpowered integrity, and he stuck to his position. ', 'Enter RFK Jr., who, along with his Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit group, preyed on the parents of children with autism who were searching for someone to blame. Research again and again has shown his assertions to be false. But repeating and funding independent vaccine studies took precious time.

They come to us having “done my research,” fueled by algorithms built to lead concerned parents down a rabbit hole of misinformation. Because they have little firsthand experience with bacterial meningitis, limb-threatening cellulitis, the devastation of measles or the infertility of mumps, they are easily convinced that vaccines are unnecessary — and even harmful.', 'When parents come in convinced of the deep state conspiracy, it is difficult to heal the partnership that we pediatricians seek to have with them. These conversations have stolen so much time from our ability to care for patients that many practices have chosen to exclude those who refuse vaccines for their children. ', 'Many parents, though, seek our advice — even when they have misgivings. When we are able to have open conversations built on appreciation and partnership, parents often gratefully follow the well-studied vaccine schedule to protect their children.', 'One of my young parents was unvaccinated as a child and resents that her parents fell for the conspiracy theories. When she first brought her adorable children in, we had lots of conversations, including about immunizations. Like my mom, she sees herself as a fierce advocate for her children when they come in for their well visits and shots. Each visit, when I explain the shots they will receive, we both laugh when she says, “Lock and Load, Dr. Pat, Lock and Load!”', 'If Kennedy is confirmed as HHS secretary, he will have the ability to submit a generation of children to the experiment he has long hoped would finally prove his misbegotten theories promoting supplements and other measures as preferable to vaccines. Americans need only to look at Samoa for predictions of that outcome. There, in 2018, a nurse tragically used a vial of paralyzing muscle relaxant to dilute a vial of measles vaccine. That mistake resulted in the deaths of two infants. This caused Samoa to suspend the measles vaccination program. Kennedy visited the island, he later wrote, because “government officials, including the Prime Minister were curious to measure health outcomes following the ‘natural experiment’ created by the respite from vaccines.”', 'One of my young parents was unvaccinated as a child and resents that her parents fell for the conspiracy theories.', 'The health outcomes included a measles outbreak that occurred months after Kennedy’s visit, which included thousands of infections and the deaths of 83 people, most of them small children. Kennedy reportedly told Samoa’s prime minister that the deaths were caused not by measles but by the vaccine used to prevent measles.', '“I never gave any public statement about vaccines. You cannot find a single Samoan who will say, ‘I didn’t get a vaccine because of Bobby Kennedy,’” Kennedy told senators Wednesday.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Despite his claims that he wouldn’t discourage vaccinations, we have every reason to believe that Kennedy, if he’s put in charge of HHS, would discourage and even defund them. Defunding vaccines would mean even the parents who are steadfast in protecting their children may not be able to afford the vaccines needed to shield them. And that would put the patients I see at increased risk of disabling disease and death.

"Trump’s pick for health secretary has many dangerous views – but some good ideas, too",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/31/donald-trump-health-secretary-robert-f-kennedy-jr-fluoride-school-lunches-additives,"['RFK Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from tap water is a matter for debate. But his plans to improve school lunches and crack down on additives are laudable', 'T\nhe United States and Britain: two countries divided by a common language and by very different approaches to health, whether it’s how healthcare is accessed, what kind of food products are sold in supermarkets, what is advertised on TV or even what is in the water that we drink from our taps. Having lived in both countries for an extensive period, the UK, in my opinion, takes a more sensible approach to implementing pro-health and wellbeing policies, closely linked to EU regulations. But the US could soon be following suit, under a range of proposals from a surprising source: Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. As I laid out last month, many of his ideas are potentially dangerous for public health – from bizarre conspiracy theories to anti-vaccineviews and campaigning – and completely divorced from data and reality. But a couple of them could turn out to be beneficial.', 'For example, the US still allows certain additives banned by the UK and EUto be added to ultra-processed foods such as cereals, sweets and biscuits, despite the fact that they have been linked to hyperactivity in children. Kennedy has suggested this week that he will ban some of these in food products. Depending on what exactly he does, this isn’t a radical suggestion: it may just put the US in line with what is done in other countries. It’s the same with his suggestions to regulate the advertising of pharmaceutical products and improve the nutritional quality of school meals.', 'But what about his pronouncements about the dangers of fluoride in drinking water? In 1945, fluoride was introduced into US drinking water because of concerns about dental health and the rise of cavities in children. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral and is proven to reduce tooth decay. And the evidence does show that fluoridated water has important dental health benefits.', 'Kennedy has vowed to remove fluoride from drinking water, claiming it is toxic. Yes, at high levels and when ingested (rather than just applied to teeth like toothpaste), fluoride can be toxic to the brain and can adversely affect the cognitive development of children – a recent Jama Pediatrics meta-analysis (which summarises other studies) showed that high levels of fluoride exposure were linked to lower IQ scores in children. Yet the point at which fluoride affects neural development is far higher than the level found in average US tap water. It is also above the level that the World Health Organization recommends as the maximum allowable concentration in drinking water. In addition, the Jama Pediatrics article was published with two expert commentaries noting that the meta-analysis findings were limited – of the 74 studies included, 45 were conducted in China – and 52 studies were highlighted as having a high risk of bias.', 'As with most things in science, fluoride isn’t absolutely good or bad. It was a tool brought in to help reduce dental problems – which it did effectively – and it’s worth constantly re-examining that policy to evaluate whether it fits with the latest evidence and state of the world.', 'Does the US still need fluoride in the water? That depends on who you ask: we now have better ways of preventing tooth decay, such as seeing a dentist regularly, brushing with fluoride toothpaste, flossing and limiting sugary foods and drinks that get stuck in teeth and encourage bacterial growth. However, dentists are increasingly out of reach for struggling families and children in deprived areas. Some countries are still moving towards adding fluoride: England and Wales introduced a bill in 2021 to allow the health secretary to bring in water fluoridation – supported by all four nations’ chief medical officers. It’s estimated that about one in 10 people in England have fluoridated drinking water, with plans to expand it further.', 'Ending water fluoridation in the US would not be a major concern for me as a public health scientist – as long as dentists are made accessible. That said, Kennedy making unfounded claims that fluoride causes thyroid disease and cancer doesn’t help inform the real public debate over fluoridation.', 'I’m more focused on whether he maintains the childhood vaccination schedule (for example against measles, whooping cough and mumps) and whether he is able to bring the US in line with the UK and the EU in terms of what is permitted to be added to foods that we buy from our shops. This might mean saying adios to the artificial food dyes used in cereals such as Froot Loops and Lucky Charms, but if it means parents being able to buy food products checked for safety for their children and healthier school lunches, that’s a huge step forward, no matter who initiates it.', 'Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh', 'Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"", 'If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation. ', 'Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics. ', 'Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina. ', '""An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,"" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a statement on the litigation. ""The plaintiff\'s allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.""', ""In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer. "", 'Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings. ', 'Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement. ', '""I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,"" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a ""direct and substantial interest."" ', 'At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a ""non-dependent, adult family member."" ', 'Kennedy\'s plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, ""It\'s very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,"" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It\'s troubling."" ', 'For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.', ""Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California."", 'The firm ""has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,"" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. ', '""We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup — consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,"" said Wisner Baum\'s managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany\'s Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer. ', ""Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS. "", 'During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.', 'Kennedy would not commit to Warren\'s request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be ""thoroughly reviewed"" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy\'s nominatioin, the senator\'s office stated.', '""It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,"" Warren said in a statement on Friday.', 'A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.', 'During Wednesday\'s hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was ""anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?""', 'Kennedy replied ""No, Mr. Chairman.""', 'As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, ""Make America Healthy Again"" and its abbreviation — MAHA — on stickers, hats and hoodies.

While appearing to ignore mainstream science, he cited flawed or tangential research to make his points, such as suggesting Black people may need different vaccines than whites.', '', '', 'His responses raised concern among health experts that Kennedy lacks basic skills needed for the job.', '“He ignores science. He cherry-picks sometimes fraudulent studies. Sometimes he takes well-done studies and takes little pieces of them out of context,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.', 'He worries that Kennedy could further damage public confidence in vaccines and “we will see return of diseases that we really haven’t seen much of and unfortunately children will suffer.”', 'Kennedy “in many ways demonstrated his lack of capacity to really understand some details around science and evidence that I think he would really need to know,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin of the American Public Health Association.', 'The science on vaccines is clear to doctors and scientists — but not to Kennedy', 'Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician, said the science is clear that measles and other childhood vaccines are safe and not linked to autism.', 'Kennedy said if shown the data he would recommend those vaccines and “not only will I do that but I will apologize for any statements that misled people otherwise.”', 'So Cassidy pulled out and read aloud definitive scientific conclusions that vaccines don’t cause autism. Kennedy rebuffed him, instead mentioning a recent paper that outside experts have called fundamentally flawed — and Cassidy agreed “has some issues” – in an attempt to counter decades of rigorous studies.', 'The senator told Kennedy his history of “undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me” – and risks casting “a shadow over President Trump’s legacy” if people die of vaccine-preventable diseases should he become health secretary.', 'Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said there’s a real-world ramification for “re-litigating and churning settled science” – diverting money and time that could be spent finding the real cause of autism.', 'Kennedy ignored science showing COVID-19 vaccines saved millions of lives', ""Kennedy claimed there's no good surveillance system to know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and lifesaving."", 'The U.S. tracks vaccine safety through multiple monitoring systems including electronic medical records from a list of health systems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also checks how vaccines fare internationally, such as during the pandemic when large databases from Israel and the U.K. helped reinforce that the new mRNA vaccines were safe and lowering deaths from the coronavirus.', '“You’re applying for the job — clearly you should know this,"" said Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. “The scientific community has established that COVID vaccines saved millions of lives and you’re casting doubt.”', 'Kennedy declines to back a vaccine that prevents cancer in women', ""AAP's O'Leary said there are about 35,000 cases of cancer related to the HPV virus that could be prevented by that vaccine, including 4,000 deaths per year. “We are already seeing decreases in the number of cases of HPV-related cancers as a result of HPV vaccination.”"", ""Kennedy didn't answer directly when asked if he stood by claims that the HPV vaccine could cause cancer or other disease. He instead brought up a pending lawsuit and suggested a jury — of non-scientists — would decide."", ""Kennedy's unfounded comment about race and vaccine schedules"", 'Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a Maryland Democrat, asked Kennedy about prior comments that Black people might need a different vaccination schedule than whites. Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked how Kennedy thought she should have been vaccinated differently.', 'Kennedy referred to some earlier papers suggesting people of African-American ancestry had a stronger immune response to measles and rubella vaccines than white people.', 'Vaccination recommendations aren’t based on race but on biological factors such as someone’s age and risk of a specific disease. Some studies show Black Americans are more hesitant than whites to receive certain vaccines.', '“That is so dangerous,” Alsobrooks told Kennedy.', '“There’s no evidence that there needs to be a different vaccine schedule based on race,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Such statements could make different populations wrongly believe “well, maybe I don’t need as many vaccines” as are recommended.', '___', 'AP Medical Writer Carla K.

Kennedy Jr. presented a striking scene that would confuse a time traveler from 10 years ago. Democratic lawmakers took turns excoriating a man who once embodied their ideals. Sen. Bernie Sanders, seemingly grasping for gotchas, was reduced to questioning Kennedy about baby clothing merchandise.', 'In another era, Democrats might have championed Kennedy’s nomination to lead Health and Human Services. His platform reads like a wish list for reformers: cracking down on toxic food additives, confronting corporate regulatory capture, and reducing drug prices. Most of all, Kennedy pledges a renewed look at the causes of cancer and other serious ailments — not simply the management of disease.\n\nSubscribe to Continue Reading', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'A cure for the common opinion', 'Get thought-provoking perspectives with our weekly newsletter.', 'You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', 'OPINION', 'OPINION', 'OPINION', 'OPINION', 'OPINION', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

Democratic senators say they have 'grave concerns' over RFK Jr.'s potential financial conflicts,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/elizabeth-warren-ron-wyden-robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs-letter-rcna190369,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ""Two Democratic senators on the committee that will get to decide whether to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination say his recent financial disclosure filing gave them “grave concern” about whether he should become the next health and human services secretary."", 'In a letter to Kennedy dated Sunday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his recently amended ethics disclosure form only raised additional questions about the scope of his potential financial conflicts of interest.', '“What is clear is that your involvement and financial interests in vaccine litigation are broad and extensive. It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related decisions and communications—which you would be empowered to make and influence as Secretary—could result in significant financial compensation for your family,” wrote Warren and Wyden, who are on the Finance Committee.', '“These conflicts, combined with your decades-long career casting doubt about the safety and efficacy of life-saving vaccines, give us grave concern about your fitness to serve as Secretary,” they continued.  ', 'Late last week, in a written follow-up response to senators after his testimony before two committees, Kennedy said he would divest his interest in ongoing litigation against Merck, an HPV vaccine maker, by signing over his financial stake to his son. ', 'Before last week’s hearings, Kennedy disclosed that his financial interests included referral fees from law firms, including from the law firm Wisner Baum. The law firm is suing Merck over the Gardasil vaccine, which protects against human papillomavirus. ', '“I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm. I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary,” his filing read.', 'Kennedy’s subsequent decision to sign over his interest to his adult son did not allay concerns of the Democratic lawmakers, who said he could retain an “indirect” financial stake in litigation involving a vaccine case against a company regulated by HHS. ', 'The senators called on Kennedy to make a series of commitments in writing to address their concerns about financial conflicts, including that he would recuse himself from vaccine-related decisions and communications, recuse himself from HHS matters that involve cases or litigation that he or his family have an interest in, and pledge not to litigate cases involving vaccines or have a financial interest in litigation for four years after he leaves the post. ', 'Kennedy was roundly criticized last week after his financial disclosures were filed, with Warren pointedly asking him whether he would pledge that for four years after he leaves his post as health and human services secretary he would not profit from his actions in government. Kennedy would not do so.  ', 'He has said he would abide by ethics guidelines while he was HHS secretary.', 'Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Kennedy, dismissed the letter.', '""Both @RonWyden and @SenWarren were a no in a Committee before @RobertKennedyJr started speaking — let’s not pretend this changes anything,"" she said on X.', ""The Finance Committee will vote on Kennedy's nomination Tuesday; a simple majority will have to approve sending his nomination to the full floor to advance his candidacy."", 'Natasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.', '© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"
