', 'According to the ESPN article, the trade discussion started on Jan. 7 at Ascension Coffee in the lobby of the Hotel Crescent Court in Uptown. There, Rob Pelinka and Nico Harrison started early talks on the trade that would rattle the NBA.', ""For those who don't know, Pelinka and Harrison are very familiar with one another. Pelinka, now the GM of the Lakers, was formerly Kobe Bryant's agent. Harrison, now the GM of the Mavericks, was formerly a Nike executive tasked with recruiting Bryant to a deal with Nike. "", 'From that relationship, which eventually resulted in a multi-million dollar signing, Pelinka and Harrison formed a bond that lasted decades. That tight bond created even tighter lips with the Luka Doncic trade — Harrison himself admitted as much in the post-trade press conference.', ""However, according to ESPN reporting, even Utah Jazz president Danny Ainge, who was the third team that made the deal possible, didn't know the magnitude of the trade. Per ESPN, Ainge didn't know Doncic was part of the deal until 30 minutes before the trigger was pulled."", 'For many Mavs fans, one question has been swirling in their heads: Why would a team that just made the Finals trade their franchise player who led them there?', ""ESPN's reporting revealed that Doncic's weight was a primary concern."", 'According to ESPN, the Mavs determined Doncic\'s ""ideal weight"" was 245 pounds. Despite the Mavs wanting Luka to hit that 245 benchmark, Luka hovered around the 250-255 mark, ESPN reported.', 'In November, the Mavs gave Doncic an 11-day absence to shed weight after he reached a weight in the high 260s, sources told ESPN. By January, when he underwent an MRI, Doncic weighed 255, the article stated.', 'According to ESPN, the Mavericks made multiple personnel moves in an attempt to prod Doncic into their desired strength and conditioning regimen, including firing former director of player health and performance Casey Smith, strength coach Jeremy Holsopple and manual therapist Casey Spangler. ', 'Per ESPN reports, all three men the franchise fired had been on the payroll since before Luka was drafted in 2018 and had strong relationships with him.', '""They get rid of everybody I like,"" Doncic reportedly said.', 'As a result, Doncic brought in his own team, according to ESPN, hiring Slovenian strength coach Anže Maček, physiotherapist Javier Barrio Calvo and nutritionist Lucia Almendros from Real Madrid. Luka reportedly paid for this full-time ""body team"" out of his pocket.', 'Per ESPN, this team did not result in a healthier Luka, and, in fact, resulted in the weight gain he experienced in November 2024. ', ""The weight concerns for Doncic were perhaps the Mavs' worst-kept secret. It was talked about on broadcasts, podcasts and all over social media. However, it never really mattered to fans."", 'When you have a star who can lead your team in points, rebounds, assists and steals in a playoff run that took them to the NBA Finals while injured, it tends not to matter if they put on a couple of pounds.', 'However, the stakes change when there are millions of dollars on the line. This summer, Doncic was eligible to sign the largest extension in league history — a $345 million five-year deal.', 'Nico Harrison made his feelings known about signing Luka to that extension during the post-trade press conference on Sunday. But in a stunning glimpse into how the team viewed Doncic, sources told ESPN that they were ""as afraid of Doncic signing the deal as they were of him not.""', 'Blame for the trade has largely fallen onto Nico Harrison, but Mavs governor Patrick Dumont still gave final approval on the deal.', ""Dumont has remained largely out of the limelight compared to the Mavs' previous owner Mark Cuban, and has not involved himself as deeply with the basketball operations of the franchise."", 'According to ESPN, Dumont trusted Harrison about the trade decision. ESPN said Dumont believed in Harrison\'s vision of a more defensive-minded team under Anthony Davis and saw it as a ""business decision that would preserve the Mavericks\' financial flexibility for the long term.""']"

Though he repeatedly expressed excitement about joining one of the most storied franchises in NBA history, he also said the two days since the trade have felt like months.', '“Honestly, it was hard; that first day was really hard,” he said. “But every day has been better. I’m just very happy to be here for this opportunity.”', 'Pelinka said the trade occurred only after Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison broached the topic over coffee in Dallas last month.

Indeed, the Slovenian star hasn’t played since late December because of a calf strain.', 'Could a move to Los Angeles that connects him with a legend like LeBron James provide Dončić with new motivation? James’ attention to fitness is well-regarded. Perhaps he can provide a blueprint to Dončić to help better his off-the-court habits.', 'The Lakers’ decision to part ways with Anthony Davis is far less controversial but no less consequential. The opportunity to bring in a 25-year-old offensive dynamo in exchange for a 31-year-old Davis appears to have been too good to pass up. Now, the Lakers are left without a defensive presence at the rim. And there will be short-term pain for Lakers fans as a result. Still, the long term is bright for the Lakers with the ability to build around Dončić. The move also likely means that James will play another year or two in Los Angeles. And he has long praised Dončić’s play publicly.  ', 'On the other side of the trade, the short-term consequences for the Mavericks will be swift. Davis can provide solid offensive output and a defensive presence the team has lacked for years. Once he and Kyrie Irving get on the same page, Dallas could be a force in the Western Conference playoff picture. The long-term picture is a bit murkier given the age and mileage on Davis and Irving. It seems there is an urgency to win now with this group.', ""Must reads from Today's list"", 'Lastly, there were the financial considerations. Miriam Adelson bought a majority stake in the Mavericks from billionaire owner Mark Cuban in 2024 for over $3 billion. Dončić was set to sign a “SuperMax” contract this offseason that would pay him $345 million for five years.

That the only growing he will do is his waist.', '“His team is part of our family,” Pelinka said. “When we make decisions around superstar players we collaborate with them.”', 'This addresses what was a problem between the Mavericks and Luka; that he wanted to follow “his people,” whereas the Mavericks did not agree with those preferences.', 'Since the Mavs dealt Doncic to the L.A.

Here is what some executives told Howard Beck at The Ringer.', '“The return sucks. Your job is to get the best return,” said another Western Conference team executive.', '“It’s shortsighted,” said an Eastern Conference team executive, adding: “If you want to do this, shop the guy. The deals you could have gotten for him are ridiculous.”', 'ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne and Tim MacMahon said executives were “furious and jealous.”', 'Unfathomable,” one Western Conference executive told ESPN.', '“I’m stunned,” an Eastern Conference executive texted.', 'From the Dallas perspective, there were two parts to this trade. Around the league, team executives and fans are still trying to wrap their heads around either part of it — let alone both of them together.', 'The first was the decision to move on from Doncic in the first place. Teams do not trade away a 25-year-old, First-Team All-NBA five years running, top-five players in the world entering their prime, unless forced to do so. Doncic forced no such thing; he literally is just about to close escrow on a new $12 million home in the Dallas area. Doncic planned to stay with the team both because he wanted to win in Dallas — he had visions of following the footsteps of Dirk Nowitzki, playing his entire career with the franchise — and because they were the only team that could offer him a supermax contract this summer of five years, $345 million.', 'It was that contract that gave Dallas some pause.', '“There’s some unique things about [Doncic’s] contract, that we had to pay attention to,” Harrison said at his press conference. “There’s other teams that were loading up. He was going to be able to decide [as a potential free agent in 2026], to his make his own decision at some point of whether he wants to be here or not, whether we want to supermax him or not, or whether he wants to opt out. So I think we had to take all that into consideration and feel like we got out in front of what could have been a tumultuous summer.”', '“Tumultuous summer” is interesting phrasing by Harrison.', 'In theory, the supermax contract was designed specifically for teams such as Dallas to hang onto their superstar players, like Doncic, and not have him bolting to another market offering similar money. The idea is to keep the best players with their teams by incentivizing them with larger paydays.', 'However, Dallas appeared to have been scared off by the large supermax number, particularly when tied to Harrison’s concerns about Doncic’s commitment to conditioning. Doncic has never shown the commitment to conditioning that other stars such as LeBron James have. There was a sense that the calf strain that has kept Doncic sidelined since Christmas this season might become the new norm, so for that and other reasons there was friction between Dallas and Doncic.', 'By that reasoning, Harrison talked himself into trading Doncic now at what should be the peak of his market.', 'Except Harrison didn’t get a peak of market return, which is the second part of this trade nobody understands — and it’s the part other GMs are angry about. Why did the Mavericks settle for so much less than they could have gotten?', 'Dallas did land Harrison’s top target — All-NBA two-way center Anthony Davis — and they also got the Lakers’ 2029 first-round pick. However, the Mavericks didn’t demand the Lakers’ other available first-round pick (2031) or a quality young player such as Dalton Knecht — or both. The Knicks gave up five first-round picks to get Mikal Bridges last summer, and while a good player, he’s no Doncic. Many other GMs would have liked the chance to beat the Lakers’ offer.', 'On the other hand, Harrison had his reasons for wanting to keep this quiet, starting with the chaos he knew would ensue if word of Doncic being available got out. And he understood there would be a massive backlash from fans.', ""Mavs GM Nico Harrison decided early on, team sources said, that the best way to trade a player of Doncic's caliber was to pick the trade —and the star— he wanted, rather than open up the process, to avoid Doncic and his agent exerting their own leverage and the crippling fan…"", 'More than just fans, if word of the trade got out, Doncic himself would have complained, fans would have sided with him, and Dallas’ new ownership likely would have balked at any trade. Former Mavericks majority owner Mark Cuban (who sold his majority share last year) unquestionably would have objected and killed the deal.', 'So Harrison went into stealth mode, working only with Lakers GM Rob Pelinka. Even Danny Ainge, the Utah executive who was the third part of the trade by taking on Jalen Hood-Schifino, didn’t know the principal players involved until less than an hour before the deal was finalized.', 'Harrison got his man, and Dallas didn’t get dramatically worse in the short term — and they would argue they got better. Harrison wants to build a defense-first team and culture, and Davis fits that much better in Harrison’s mind, even if AD is six years older than Doncic and not near the offensive force.', '“I’ll just say there’s levels to it,” Harrison said of how players mesh in a team culture. “And there’s people that fit the culture, and there’s people that come in and add to the culture. And those are two distinct things, and I believe the people that were coming in are adding to the culture.”', 'That culture has to be strong, because in the NBA talent wins out most of the time, and the Dallas Mavericks did not get enough talent back in sending out Doncic.', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

"", 'Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison confirmed that he approached the Lakers about trading Dončić while only one other team knew he was available, according to The Athletic. Such a decision essentially prevented a bidding war for one of the top players in the league. ', ""As the dust started to settle on the deal, FOX Sports' top personalities and contributors weighed in on the Dončić move. Here are some of the notable reactions to a trade that still has many scratching their heads."", ""Like many, McIntyre didn't like that the Mavericks opted to trade Dončić, believing they were operating out of fear that he wouldn't live up to the five-year, $345 million extension he was eligible for. McIntyre disagreed with the notion that the Mavs made a mistake in limiting their possible trade partners in this deal, however, as Dončić is set to become a free agent in 2026."", '""It doesn\'t work like that,"" McIntyre said Monday. ""Remember, they had to ship Luka somewhere they knew he could sign. Nobody\'s going to try and rent Luka for a year and then just have him walk and give up the whole franchise. I actually narrowed it down and only came up with three teams that could have gone after Luka had a bidding war.""', 'Those teams were the Boston Celtics, the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat, with McIntyre pointing to their big-market prestige and assets as reasons why they could\'ve made a deal for Dončić. Still, McIntyre doesn\'t think it would\'ve been smart to create a bidding war. ""The second the league got wind of Luka Dončić being on the market, it would\'ve been a total disaster,"" he said. ""The price would\'ve gone down. Luka would\'ve checked out. Kyrie Irving and company would\'ve been like, ‘What are we doing? We\'re trading Luka?\'""', 'Nichols, however, disagreed with McIntyre. She thinks that his argument doesn\'t hold because the Lakers essentially got Dončić ""sight unseen.""', '""The Lakers traded for him without knowing what kind of contract he would sign a year-and-a-half from now,"" Nichols said. ""By the way, I think if you polled most teams in the league, not all, but most, they would take a guaranteed year-and-a-half of Luka Dončić and say, ‘We can convince him that this is the place he wants to stay.\' The Mavericks did it with Kyrie Irving when they traded for him and only had three months to convince him.""', ""The Mavericks were able to ink Irving to a multi-year deal when he was a free agent in 2023 and made it to the NBA Finals in the following season. Nichols thinks that could've happened if the Mavericks traded him to another team."", '""The idea that Luka could\'ve made a list, and they wouldn\'t have had any takers if it wasn\'t his preferred destination, I don\'t really buy that,"" Nichols added. ""I think Luka Dončić is such a unique talent and the idea you\'d have him for a year-and-a-half — look at what Toronto did with Kawhi Leonard. They were like, ‘Great, we\'ve got him for a year, we hope we can convince him to stay. But even if we can\'t, it\'s worth it.\' Guess what? They couldn\'t convince him, and it was still worth it.""', ""Bucher, a longtime NBA insider, is one of the few who approved of the trade for both teams. His rationale for liking the deal on the Lakers' end was essentially the same as everyone else's."", '""We\'re seeing something that we\'ve never seen before, which is a team making a decision not involving LeBron James and basically saying, ‘We\'ve got your replacement, and we are turning the page,\'"" Bucher said Monday. ""That\'s what the move in getting Luka Dončić has done for the Lakers. I think it\'s a brilliant move for the Lakers because Anthony Davis was not that type of guy, in terms of being your alpha and a guy that you build around.""', 'As for why he was a fan of the deal for the Mavericks, Bucher actually thinks that it makes them more of a ""championship-caliber team"" this season. ""If you look at the way the Dallas Mavericks are constituted and you add Anthony Davis to the vehicle that Luka drove to the Finals,"" Bucher added. ""I look at the landscape of the NBA, I love the fact that Nico Harrison said, ‘I\'m not buying that Luka Dončić — he might have been able to get us to the Finals last year but then was not able to seal the deal — I\'m not sure if that\'s going to change. I like the way my team is playing. If I can get a guy that\'s playing at a Defensive Player of the Year level and is one of the best bigs in the league, I think that could be the difference maker in winning a title.', '""He was fearless in making this happen, and he [has] put it all on himself.""', 'Pierce was in disbelief when he heard the news, but he quickly realized this was a great way for the Lakers to start planning for their future. On the flip side, the former NBA star had his reservations about the two superstars in Dončić and James playing together in Los Angeles, even suggesting a trade for the 40-year-old as a last ditch effort to win another championship before retirement. ', '""Initially, I was in shock and I didn\'t believe the news,"" he said. ""It took me a minute for it to register, because I was like, \'I\'ve never seen a player in their prime, in the MVP talks every single year, get traded.\' Coming off of a Finals appearance at 25-years-old. That\'s just something that\'s never happened … so when it sunk in — I was shocked. I was just like, ‘Why would the Lakers or Dallas do this?’ Moreso, ‘Why would Dallas do this than anything?’""', '""They can\'t play together,"" Pierce continued. ""They require the ball. They\'re ball-dominant players that dictate everything their team does. This wasn\'t a play for this year. … This is a great trade to line up the future because now you can start thinking about building around Luka. If I [were] the Lakers, I would trade Bron to start that process early. It\'ll give Bron another opportunity to win a championship because it\'s not going to happen on this team. You can trade Bron to … Cleveland. You know, if you can get an Evan Mobley back, pairing with Donovan Mitchell and [Darius] Garland … do that. ', '""Because I still feel like LeBron got enough in the tank to win a championship but it\'s just not happening here in L.A.""', ""While Dončić and James can dominate a court on their own, Broussard, like Pierce, fears the two scorers will have a tough time co-existing if they continue their respective styles of play. Broussard's main concern is the Lakers defense, as he believes the team will now be worse off without Davis.  "", '""I don\'t think they\'re contenders,"" he said. ""Defensively, they are going to be horrific. If LeBron does try to be the great defender again, he\'ll probably get hurt. He can\'t go out there and do that. Luka is arguably the worst on-ball defender in the league. He gets blown by more than just about anybody, so defensively, they were a lower tier defensive team with Anthony Davis.', '""I do think that it\'s a tough fit because Luka puts the ‘B’ in ball-dominant. I mean, he\'s more ball-dominant than LeBron was in his prime, and I think Luka cannot play off the ball. He will just be standing there. LeBron has gotten better at playing off the ball in the last few years, but he’s not great at playing off the ball either. … They\'re not a great shooting team.

And then depending on that, see how I feel. If not Thursday, then more than likely Saturday.”', 'And when he does make his Mavericks’ debut, it almost certainly will be as their starting power forward alongside Daniel Gafford at center and P.J. Washington at small forward to fill out a formidable front line.', 'When asked about returning to his more natural position after playing center for the Lakers for years, Davis said: “Obviously, Dereck (Lively II) is dealing with an injury, but Gaff is playing phenomenal. So I think that’s the plan, but we’ll see how it goes.', '“Right now, I’m just excited to get back to playing basketball. Given the whole trade thing but also the injury, each time I’m on the floor, I feel better. But I haven’t played power forward in a long time, since I was first in LA. To be back at the four, I’m excited to see how it goes.”', 'Davis and Irving have a history together, along with Klay Thompson. All three were on the 2014 World Cup team that won the gold medal. And Davis said he and Irving have discussed previously about pairing up their talents in the NBA.', '“Me and Kai talked about this I think in 2018 when I asked for a trade from New Orleans,” Davis said. “He was in Boston at the time and he ended up leaving for Brooklyn. We’ve been wanting to play alongside each other for a very long time. Now we got that opportunity to do so.”', 'But as long as Irving and Davis have been friends, the relationship with Harrison goes back even further for Davis.', 'When Harrison was a Nike executive, it was his job to help recruit elite athletes to the Nike brand. Davis certainly was a qualifier.', '“Nico’s known me since I was in high school,” Davis said. “Obviously, one of the guys I got close to when I signed with Nike.

Obviously, little tweaks that he brought here. But for the most part, I’m very excited. I’m not trying to come here and disrupt anything. I’m just trying to add value to what they already have. But having him as the captain of the ship definitely makes my life a little easier.”', 'And if there was any doubt about Davis’ commitment to the Mavericks, it surely was erased when he waived the trade kicker that could have cost the franchise a hefty price.', 'Instead, that’s money that could be used to facilitate other moves, should they arise.', '“Just trying to help the team,” Davis said. “You always want to get better and losing a monument-to-be like Luka, obviously, it’s a lot.

', 'From ESPN:', ""Even the Utah Jazz, the third team that facilitated the transaction by collecting two second-round picks for absorbing Jalen Hood-Schifino, didn't know Doncic and Davis were a part of the deal until about an hour before it was completed, league sources said. "", ""Even Jazz president Danny Ainge, who hails from the Lakers' hated rival, the Boston Celtics, had about only 30 minutes notice, sources said, that Los Angeles was about to acquire Doncic to be the new face of its franchise. But by then it was too late to do much about it. NBA history was about to be altered."", ""Also not in the loop, as reported by The Athletic on Monday, was Doncic's agent, Bill Duffy. Without the ability to talk to Duffy, and by extension Doncic, the Lakers couldn't know whether Doncic, whose contract is up in 2026, would commit to signing a long-term extension with Los Angeles. Without that knowledge, they wouldn't risk giving up a second first-round pick, which everyone has been questioning how they got away with withholding. "", ""Frankly, even without being able to assure an Doncic extension, the Lakers still should've been forced to give up that second first-rounder and honestly a lot more than that. This is Luka Doncic. To even get him inside your locker room for a chance to pitch him on staying long term is worth more than the Mavericks got. Harrison was so eager to get this thing done, and so dead set on Davis being the guy he wanted, he seemingly didn't care what else came in the package. "", ""The part about the possibility of this trade not getting leaked before it was actually set to happen is sort of understandable. Well, from the Lakers' side, it's totally understandable. If no one else knows, no one else can bid against you. "", ""But from the Mavericks' side, this seems like some pretty rookie negotiating. OK, it's understandable you don't want Doncic getting wind in case the deal doesn't happen and now you've got an unhappy superstar, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime trade chip. If you're this committed to cashing it in, not doing everything in your power to maximize the return is ludicrous. "", ""This whole thing is ludicrous, really. I tried to understand Dallas' motivation initially. I really did. But once it was reported that Doncic didn't demand out and that Harrison really just believes a 32-year-old injury-prone Davis is more valuable that a 25-year-old generational talent who has already made more All-NBA first teams than Stephen Curry while taking the Mavericks to two Western Conference finals and one NBA Finals inside his first seven seasons, it became impossible to see Harrison's logic. "", ""It's strange, because I actually still do believe the Mavericks are better positioned to win a title this year with Davis. On paper, they look like a stacked two-way team with all kinds of lineup versatility. But Doncic leading your franchise for potentially the next decade-plus is worth way more than a short-term championship chase, which probably won't come to fruition anyway. "", ""Even if it does, I honestly believe Mavs fans would rather not win a title with Doncic than win one with the guy who replaced him. I remember feeling that way about John Elway when I was a kid. He was my guy, even if the Broncos were consistently breaking my heart in the Super Bowl. If someone would've come to me and said you can have Joe Montana and a championship if you trade Elway to the Niners, I would've told that individual, with all due respect, to get the hell out of my face.

It marks the first team other than Dallas that Dončić — a 2018 first-round pick — will play for in his seven-year NBA career.', 'The 25-year-old Dončić was eligible to sign a five-year, $345 million contract extension with the Mavericks this summer. All signs pointed toward him putting pen to paper on that historic deal with Dallas before this abrupt move.', 'Mavericks players were blindsided by the trade. One player, according to a source briefed on his thinking, believed Dončić would accompany Dallas on its five-game road trip.', 'Instead, Dončić, who has been oft-injured this season, appears headed for Los Angeles. He’s played in just 22 games, averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists in those contests, and he hasn’t competed since sustaining a calf strain on Christmas.', 'For Davis, 31, it ends a six-year stint with the Lakers that included an NBA championship in 2020. The 10-time All-Star averaged 24.8 points, 11 rebounds and 3.2 assists while with Los Angeles, and is now slated to pair with eight-time All-Star Kyrie Irving in Dallas.', 'The multi-team deal, which includes the Utah Jazz, will also see the Lakers land Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris, while the Mavs will acquire Max Christie and a 2029 first-round pick.', 'The Jazz will receive Jalen Hood-Schifino and multiple second-round picks, Those picks will be a 2025 Los Angeles Clippers second-rounder and a 2025 Mavericks second-rounder.', 'There has been speculation for weeks as to what the Lakers’ next move was going to be — or not be — with the deadline approaching.', 'League and team sources suggested tempering expectations with the Lakers only possessing underwhelming mid-sized salaries and two first-round picks that they valued highly.', '', 'No one saw this coming.', 'In a seismic move that’ll determine the franchise’s direction for years to come, the Lakers have acquired the next face of their franchise in Dončić. They are set up as well as possible for the post-James era.', 'I can’t tell what’s real and fake anymore on these apps. Luka really going to the lakers or nah ?', '— CJ McCollum (@CJMcCollum) February 2, 2025', '', 'The cost was steep: Davis, their best player and the next face of the franchise, an emerging 3-and-D wing in Christie and their 2029 first-round pick unprotected. The Lakers will take a notable step back defensively and don’t have as deep of a roster as they previously did. They also clearly need a starting center — something Davis was clamoring for before being dealt.', 'But the prize was undoubtedly worth it in Dončić, a generational talent who has often been compared to James due to his unprecedented blend of scoring, playmaking and basketball IQ at his size. He’s already been to the conference finals and NBA Finals. James is the kind of mentor who can show him how to get over the championship hump.', 'The Lakers’ offense will skyrocket once he’s healthy, and as James eventually decides on his future in the coming seasons, Dončić can take the mantle of the next great Laker.', 'As has historically been the case with the Lakers for decades, they always find their next superstar. — Jovan Buha, Lakers beat writer', 'Only eight months removed from an NBA Finals appearance, the Mavericks are trading their superstar guard who they targeted in the 2018 draft.', 'Dončić, a teenage prodigy who won EuroLeague MVP at 19 years old, was named an All-Star in his second NBA season. In 2022, Dončić’s playoff heroics helped the Mavericks make a surprise run to the Western Conference Finals.', 'Last spring, Dončić got Dallas back to the Conference Finals again alongside running mate Irving. This time, Dallas advanced to the NBA Finals. Dončić averaged 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds and 8.2 assists in Dallas’ five-game series win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. His game-winning shot over Rudy Gobert in Game 2 was a defining moment of the series.', '', 'The Mavericks entered this season with championship aspirations. They had won 15 of 17 games going into their Christmas Day game against the Timberwolves. Dončić exited that game in the first half with a left calf strain and has been unable to play since. He was expected to return sometime before the All-Star break.', 'Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison is expected to address the team before Sunday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers to explain why Dallas made this trade, league sources said.', 'Last summer, the Mavericks acquired Klay Thompson in a sign-and-trade. Thompson signed a three-year deal worth $50 million to play alongside Irving and Dončić. That trio wound up playing in 20 games together before Dončić got hurt and then was traded.', 'Dončić, who turns 26 years old later this month, is just entering his prime years.', 'Davis is in his 13th NBA season. He remains one of the league’s most productive big men. He is averaging 25.7 points, 11.9 rebounds and 2.1 blocks.', 'Davis expressed a desire to play alongside other centers in Los Angeles. If the Mavericks want to play Davis at forward, they can insert either Daniel Gafford or Dereck Lively II next to him.', 'Davis is under contract through the 2026-27 season. He has a player option in 2027-28 for $62.8 million.', 'Moving Dončić will increase the load Irving must carry offensively. The 32-year-old is in the midst of a strong season, all while he has been dealing with a bulging disc in his back. Irving has a decision to make about his future this summer. He holds a $44 million player option for next season. — Christian Clark, Mavericks beat writer', 'The Jazz, in the middle of a rebuild, are in salary accumulation mode and will continue to be in the days leading to the trade deadline, according to league sources.', '', 'This is Utah’s second trade of the day. They earlier completed a deal with the Clippers, picking up a second-round pick and the salary of Mo Bamba and P.J. Tucker. The Jazz are expected to move on from Bamba in the near future, according to league sources.', 'The question is why would the Jazz work to help the Lakers? Utah owns Los Angeles’ 2027 first-round picks, top-4 protected. This is a trade that should make the Lakers a better team, and maybe even a championship team. This certainly may devalue the pick a bit. — Tony Jones, Jazz beat writer', 'How do the Lakers, consistently, decade after decade, pull this off?', 'They got Kareem in his prime. They got Kobe at the start of his career. They got Shaq in his prime. They got Pau Gasol in his prime. They got James, if not in his prime, not all that far past it. They got…Davis in his prime.', 'And, now, they get Dončiċ, who has been first-team all-NBA five straight years, and just led his good but hardly impregnable franchise to the finals within the past year, as he enters his prime. They now have the post-LeBron era ready to go. If Luka is ball-dominant — you look up “heliocentric” in the dictionary, and there’s his picture — he’s still a great talent and other great talents will want to play with him.', 'The Lakers’ part of this trade is easy to understand. This season does not matter. They had to prepare for the next decade without LeBron. They just have.', 'But I’m trying to process this from the Mavs’ perspective. If you accept at face value that they still had issues with Dončiċ’s conditioning and were worried about his long-term future because of it — and didn’t want to commit a $345 supermax contract to him this summer — OK. I don’t get the timing of doing it now, though, because you could sign him to the supermax and still have, at least, 15 to 20 teams that would line up and try to make a deal for him. It’s Luka Dončiċ. He’s a superstar. Superstars his age never become available via trade. But, OK. You want to trade him now.', '', 'But, if that’s the case…you don’t call the Miami Heat and ask for Bam Adebayo? You don’t call the Memphis Grizzlies and ask for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane? You don’t call the Cavaliers and ask for Evan Mobley? You don’t call…the Milwaukee Bucks…and ask for Giannis? You focus solely on Davis?', 'I\'ve been covering the NBA for 37 years. Almost nothing that happens – deals, free agent signings, coach hirings/firings – rises to the level of, as the great Ben Bradlee used to call them, ""Holy S–t"" stories. You just get used to the unexpected.\nThis is a ""Holy S–t"" trade.', '— David Aldridge (@davidaldridgedc) February 2, 2025', '', 'Davis is still a great player, to be sure. He may well be a first-team all-NBA selection this season. But he’s a 31-year-old great player with a history of injuries, and your remaining co-star in Dallas, Irving, is 31. You just sent your 25-year-old, top-five player in the NBA to the Lakers for Davis, along with one future first-round pick.', 'The Knicks just gave up five first-rounders … for Mikal Bridges!', 'What in the name of Al Bianchi is going on here?', 'By all accounts, Dončiċ had no idea this was about to happen, and hadn’t issued any type of trade request internally. So, it doesn’t matter whether he would have re-signed with the team that acquired him now. There’s no guarantee he’s going to re-sign with the Lakers, either, and L.A. pulled the trigger, anyway. Because you pull the trigger for Luka Dončiċ! And you figure out the rest later! Other teams with younger superstars would have pulled the trigger for Luka, too. He’s that good.', 'One has to wonder if this would have happened had Mark Cuban still been the primary owner of the franchise. Lord knows Dončiċ and the Mavs have had their issues over the years, and if one can accept at face value the notion that the New Orleans Pelicans aren’t certain that they can stick with Zion Williamson long-term with his injury past, you can at least begin to see why Dallas no longer thought Luka was worth the trouble.', 'But, Lord. They better be right. — David Aldridge, NBA columnist', '— Marcus Thompson, Fred Katz and Mike Vorkunov contributed to this report.', '', '(Photo: Tim Heitman / Getty Images)', '']"

The Mavericks confirmed the trade Sunday morning after the stunning news broke shortly after midnight ET.', ""Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris will also go to the Lakers, while Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round pick will head to the Mavericks. The Jazz will receive Jalen Hood-Schifino, a 2025 second-round pick via the Los Angeles Clippers and the Mavericks' 2025 second-round pick in the trade first reported by ESPN that comes days before the Feb. 6 trade deadline."", 'This is one of the most substantial and surprising trades in NBA history and will alter the course of two franchises.', ""From the Mavericks' perspective, this is particularly shocking. Doncic, 25, has been one of the league's best players since entering the league in 2018. He has made five consecutive all-NBA first teams and led the Mavericks to the NBA Finals last year, where they fell to the Boston Celtics. "", 'For his career, he has averaged 28.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game while shooting 47% from the field and is widely regarded as one of the five best players in the world. Players of his caliber rarely get traded unless they force their way out of town. Per Marc Stein, Doncic did not make such a request. Though CBS Sports NBA insider Bill Reiter reports that Doncic was not planning to stay with Dallas as his contract ended in 2026.', '""We really feel like we got ahead of what was going to be a tumultuous summer, him being eligible for the supermax and also a year away from him being able to opt out of any contract,"" Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told the Dallas Morning News. ""And so we really felt like we got out in front of that. We know teams, they\'ve had it out there, teams have been loading up to try to sign him once that comes available.""', ""Doncic's poor defense, which stuck out in the Finals, and regular conditioning issues were reportedly factored in Dallas' decision, too. Doncic has been sidelined since Christmas due to a calf injury and has never played more than 72 games in a season. "", '""I believe that defense wins championships,"" Harrison told ESPN about the decision to trade Doncic. ""I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We\'re built to win now and in the future.""', ""The Mavericks will now look to move forward with a Davis-Kyrie Irving pairing. Those two have a chance to be a dynamite combination, and they have a balanced roster around them. It seems that Dallas could have gotten more for Doncic, however, and if health and conditioning was a concern with him, they certainly didn't solve it by adding Davis, who currently is nursing a foot injury, though he is coming off the healthiest season of his career in 2023-24 (76 games played). "", 'At 26-23, the Mavericks sit in ninth place in the crowded Western Conference. They are 2.5 games back of a top-six seed and guaranteed playoff spot and 1.5 games ahead of 11th place and missing out on the Play-In Tournament entirely. ', ""For the Lakers, the Mavericks' concerns were their gain. In Doncic they now have a young superstar who can possibly be the face of their franchise for the next decade. Any concerns about what may happen to the organization once LeBron James retires have just evaporated. "", 'As for the present, the Lakers now have two of the most gifted offensive players in the league. James, even at age 40, can still dial it up from time to time, as he showed hours before the trade when he dropped a triple-double in a win over the red-hot New York Knicks. He cannot do so every night, however, and with Doncic by his side, James will have more of a chance to pick and choose his spots, which should keep him fresh until and during the playoffs. ', ""The Lakers have won eight of their last 10 to climb to fifth place in the West at 28-19, but were generally not considered true title threats due to James' age and their lack of offensive creation and poor defense. Losing Davis certainly hurts the latter, but the former will no longer be an issue. Are James and Doncic enough to truly contend? We'll soon find out. "", '© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

The Lakers also acquired Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris in the deal, through which the Mavericks also gain Max Christie and a 2029 first-round draft pick alongside Davis.', 'Doncic has been the face of the Mavericks since the team acquired him from the Atlanta Hawks in 2018—and he has arguably been the most consistent player in the lineup for several seasons.', 'Defending the deal, Dallas general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN that he was worried about their defense, insisting that trading Doncic for Davis will improve their chance at fighting other teams from scoring any points.', 'However, the explanation has proven to be less than satisfactory for fans who slammed Harrison as rumors swirled that Doncic did not request the trade and has been left less than thrilled about the terms of the deal, according to USA Today.', 'Now, Parsons is also chiming in by alleging that Doncic was all the more blindsided because he had just closed on a $15 million property in Dallas one week before being traded.', '(Soobum Im/Getty Images)', 'While speaking on FanDuel’s flagship NBA show, “Run It Back,” Parsons claimed that Doncic had just closed the deal on the new home last week and “cried” when he learned he would no longer be a part of the Dallas Mavericks.', '“This dude bought a $15 million house, just closed, like, last week in Dallas,” Parsons claimed. “Apparently, he cried when he found out.”', 'Parsons did not share any information about the property that Doncic has allegedly purchased—and the Dallas Mavericks star’s spokespersons did not return repeated requests for comment.', 'However, there are currently several properties on the market for around $15 million that currently have sales pending.', 'Per property records, Doncic’s name is listed on the deed of only one property: a four-bedroom home in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas.', 'Built in 1984, the home has had a serious makeover and is now a modern showpiece. It’s also in the middle of a secluded cul-de-sac, a favored locale for high-profile ballers.', 'Doncic snagged it for $3.3 million in June 2020. When it was up for sale, it was marketed as an “escape from the city,” which also appeals to celebrities who value privacy.', 'Highlights include an open floor plan, hardwood floors throughout, and a sleek kitchen. The welcoming backyard features a pool, a pavilion with a grill, and a drop-down movie projection screen.', '(Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images)', '(chandlerparsons/Instagram)', 'It remains unclear whether Doncic will hold on to the property or sell it—and any other home he may have purchased of late—now that he is bound for the West Coast.', 'Following the news, Doncic penned a heartfelt message to his fans and to the Dallas community, revealing that he thought he was going to “spend my career” with the team.', '“Seven years ago, I came here as a teenager to pursue my dream of playing basketball at the highest level. I thought I’d spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship,” he wrote.', '“The love and support you all have given me is more than I could have ever dreamed of.

(AP) — Luka Dončić was nearly asleep last Saturday night in Dallas when his phone buzzed. Only then did he learn that the Mavericks had just stunned the sports world by trading him to the Los Angeles Lakers.', '“You can imagine how surprised I was,” Dončić said. “I had to check if it was April 1. I didn’t really believe it.”', 'The superstar has begun to recover after his first two days in L.A., and he’s growing increasingly excited about a new chapter with LeBron James and his famed new team on the sunny West Coast.', 'LAKE SHOW LUKA PIC.TWITTER.COM/Y338SMOLJK', '— LOS ANGELES LAKERS (@LAKERS) FEBRUARY 4, 2025', '', 'And while his past and future teammates say Dončić has never lacked motivation to be great, he has all the fuel he’ll ever need after the Mavericks inherently questioned his talent and determination by making this seismic trade.', '“It was a big shock,” Dončić said. “(Dallas) was home, so it was really hard moments for me. … (But now) I get to play in the greatest club in the world, and I’m excited for this new journey.”', 'The Lakers formally welcomed Dončić on Tuesday, less than three days after they traded Anthony Davis and Max Christie in a three-team deal for the Slovenian scorer who won his first scoring title last season before leading the Mavs to the NBA Finals. Dončić is a five-time All-NBA selection and a five-time All-Star.', 'Stars of Dončić’s age and accomplishments are almost never traded in any sport, and particularly not in such an abrupt manner. But when Dallas decided to move on from its 25-year-old centerpiece, the Lakers eagerly gave up Davis — one of basketball’s best big men — to make it happen.', 'Dončić is still processing the upheaval, but he already is seeing the limitless upside of a career in Los Angeles that will begin alongside the 40-year-old James, the top scorer in NBA history.', '“Honestly, it was hard at first,” Dončić said. “That first day was really hard. I felt like these last 48 hours was one month. Emotionally, it was really hard, but today was much better. This is the Lakers. It’s one of the best clubs in history, so I’m excited to be here.”', 'General manager Rob Pelinka didn’t hide his glee at landing Dončić when they met with the media at the Lakers’ training complex.

Dončić has often described James as his idol.', '“It’s just like a dream come true,” Dončić said. “I always looked up to him. There’s so many things I can learn from him, and I’m just excited to learn everything and get to play with him. It’s an amazing feeling.”', 'Dončić hasn’t played since Christmas because of a calf strain, but he is close to a return.

Pelinka clearly took pride in keeping a lid on these negotiations, which began at a coffee shop with Dallas GM Nico Harrison, a longtime friend.', 'Some of the league’s biggest names — names who, like Dončić, would generally be considered untouchable in trades — have reacted in complete disbelief.', '“Especially with (Dallas) coming off the finals, it’s a reminder that there are only a few in this league that can go to sleep with any type of confidence that you’ll still be there,” Golden State guard Stephen Curry said. “It’s kind of a very unique situation across the board.”', 'Added Minnesota guard Anthony Edwards: “They traded probably the best scorer in the NBA at 25.

I feel bad for Luka, man.”', 'The Lakers also acquired Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris in the trade with Dallas. Both praised Dončić’s work ethic and leadership — and both laughed at the widespread notion the Mavs were irredeemably concerned about Dončić’s conditioning and work ethic.', '“I hear the stuff about him not being in shape, but if you can go in an NBA game and get 30 and 15 and 10 like it’s nothing, then I don’t really know what shape is,” Morris said. “You’re gonna see it really soon.

The German veteran — best known in L.A. for hitting a particularly spectacular 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat the Lakers in March 2023 — says he will be re-evaluated in eight weeks, hopefully allowing him to return around the postseason.', '“I don’t know if a guy like Luka needs extra motivation, because I’ve seen him work, and how competitive he is over the years,” Kleber said. “I think he was that type of person already before.

John Kuntz, cleveland.com"", 'CLEVELAND, Ohio — Tristan Thompson thought it was fake.', 'That was a recurrent reaction to the Dallas Mavericks trading 25-year-old superstar Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in a package that included Anthony Davis during the late hours of an otherwise sleepy Saturday night — arguably the most shocking deal in NBA history that left many baffled and speechless, wondering if ace insider Shams Charania had gotten hacked. Even Charania had to send out a follow-up, essentially confirming his own reporting.', 'Who are The 40 Most Influential People in Cleveland Sports when it comes to fan happiness? See our list and how we ranked them.', 'Thompson was watching Seinfeld reruns in bed at the time, winding down and getting ready for some shut eye with a home game against the Mavericks about 15 hours away. Then his group chat went crazy, as teammate Darius Garland sent the first message.', '“What is this, a hack,” Thompson wondered aloud.', 'Tough to know these days, especially with so many social media parody accounts.', 'Nearly two million basketball lovers follow a handle known as “NBA Central” — an aggregation account that often gathers information from various reporters and posts it on X, formerly Twitter. Sourcing. Rumors. Quotes. Photos. Videos. Notable stats.', 'But there’s also a fake account — NBA Centel — that takes great pride in duping fans with a comedic flare. NBA players have become fully aware of it too.', '“We have a group chat with all our boys and stuff,” Thompson said. “I put in the chat, ‘Yo, D.G. you got Centel’d.’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah. All right.’ And then D.G. sent the next one when Shams was like, ‘I’m not hacked. This is real.’ I was like, ‘Oh, (expletive).’', '“You think it was fake just because the reality of like, not even about A.D., that’s bro, A.D. is amazing, Hall of Famer, you could run off the accolades, but it’s more so the Luka Doncic point. He had it made, tailored exactly to his liking, so it would’ve seemed from the outside, right? They said it’s the first time in NBA history two first-team All-NBA guys get traded midseason. That’s pretty big for it to happen. K.D. (Kevin Durant) said it best, at end of day, business is transactional. If a transaction works and the card don’t decline, then that (expletive) gets approved.”', 'And, yet the Mavericks aren’t looking for a refund — despite Doncic being a perennial MVP candidate, five-time All-Star and generational talent who led Dallas to the Finals last year. In his seventh career season, Doncic averages 28.6 points, the third-highest scoring average in NBA history to this point.', 'When asked about the momentous deal, Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison said it was in the best interest of the franchise.', 'What? How? Why?', 'As Harrison spoke from an overcrowded room near the visitor’s locker room inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, he emphasized the importance of culture and spoke about a specific identity.', '“The players that we’re bringing in, we believe, exemplify that,” Harrison said. “We think defense wins championships, and we’re bringing in one of the best two-way players in the league.”', 'The trade was partially about Doncic. The Mavericks were reportedly concerned about his weight, conditioning, lackadaisical defense and off-court habits. There was organizational hesitancy to offer him the cap-restrictive supermax deal worth five years and $345 million. Harrison addressed that looming decision, calling it a “unique” situation and saying the team got in front of what could have been a “tumultuous summer.”', 'It was also about Davis — and a specific vision.', 'One that ties directly to Cleveland.', '“I think if you look at the Cavaliers, that’s what you’re going to see,” Harrison told the Dallas Morning News early Sunday morning, singling out Cleveland’s imposing frontcourt of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. “Anthony’s probably going to finish games at the five, but you’re going to see those guys play together. When the Lakers won, he played the four.”', 'The Mavericks already have promising youngster Dereck Lively II and last year’s trade deadline acquisition Daniel Gafford to play inside. The idea is to pair Davis with either one of them, creating an interior fortress that can improve the league’s 13th-ranked D.', 'It wasn’t long ago that some around the league scoffed at Cleveland’s two-big plan, wondering if the front office needed to split the supposedly ill-fitting Mobley and Allen, reconfiguring the roster to match the space-ball era. President of basketball operations Koby Altman answered multiple questions about that subject during last May’s end-of-season wrap-up. He even had some of his data-driven cohorts pull numbers supporting the keep-them-together stance.', '“They said it wouldn’t work,” Mobley explained when informed of Harrison’s comments following Cleveland’s record-setting 144-101 win over short-handed Dallas. “I feel like we figured out a way each year and got better playing with each other. Now it’s clearly working. I feel like, a lot of teams are just — the copycat league and trying to figure out the new wave of how to play basketball.', '“That might be the new wave.”', 'The Cavs have been riding it to the league’s best record at 40-9.', '“We’ve built something special here,” Allen told cleveland.com. “We’ve built something that works, that not a lot of people thought would work. We proved them wrong. You don’t prove anything until you’re winning. I think this year is starting to prove that we are becoming what we always thought it would be. Now people are seeing it and starting to copy that success.”', 'The Cavs have played 633 minutes with Allen and Mobley together this season. In those minutes, the team has an offensive rating of 124.1, a defensive rating of 109.7 and a net rating of 14.4. It’s become one of Cleveland’s most reliable and effective combinations.', '“Willingness is first,” Allen said. “You can look at another big man and think, ‘Oh, he’s taking up my space.’ But we don’t do that. We have been willing to adapt every single thing and have found a system that works for both of us.”', 'That was Atkinson’s vision. During his lengthy interview process with Cleveland decision-makers this offseason, he arrived with a detailed PowerPoint presentation and numerous film clips — some from his days in Golden State with Draymond Green and Kevon Looney. It was all intended to show why Allen and Mobley could flourish. Together.', '“That was part of the thing I really pushed in my interview with Koby — yes, we need this, I’d love to keep them together,” Atkinson said. “I think in the playoffs you need various ways to play and I’m glad that combination has been excellent together this year. Let’s see how it works out for us in the end.”', 'The Mavericks aren’t the first opponent to mention mimicking the Cavs’ two-big approach.', 'Miami’s Erik Spoelstra introduced a new pairing of Bam Adebayo and Ke’lel Ware — the 7-foot rookie who moved into the starting lineup about two weeks ago. The Minnesota Timberwolves tried it with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert before sending Towns to New York this past summer. The top-seeded Western Conference juggernaut Oklahoma City Thunder will eventually have that same look with Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren. More could come, especially if Cleveland’s style translates to playoff success.', '“The NBA is such a copycat league,” Thompson said. “When Golden State was 73-9 and running up all those 3s, every team wanted to play Moneyball and shoot 40 3s a game. Then you came with the wave where you had the Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and Brook Lopez where you had the five that could space and shoot 3s. Now you’re in the era right now where you’ve got to have bigs that guard one through five.', '“I think for what we’re trying to do, it works because Ev is making 3s, and we interchange them. You kind of do hockey shifts where you have six minutes on, the next guy comes in, you come with different waves.', '“We’re doing something right if others are trying to follow suit.”', 'Powered by Advance Insights', '1 of 5', 'To understand how we may use the results of this poll, please read our\nPrivacy Policy and User Agreement.

Maybe it was the joy that died.', '“This is what I felt like after my last breakup,” a caller on Kirk Henderson’s and Josh Bowe’s podcast Pod Maverick said. A trade reaction episode that extended into the early hours of the next day, as Kirk talked to one fan after another, venting, raging, furious - heartbroken - fans.', 'Outside the AAC in Dallas, flowers and signs were left by the Dirk statue, and protesters gathered with signs saying “Worst trade in NBA history” and “We demand answers”. They even brought a casket, mourning the loss of Luka Dončić.', 'As night turned into day, and people somehow had to get used to thinking of El Niño Maravilla in a Lakers jersey, Luka Dončić shared a touching message on his social media pages.', '“I thought I’d spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship,” it said, not helping the burning sensation of betrayal and pure rage that had been preventing the whole fanbase and a huge amount of basketball fans, media people and casual observers from getting any sleep that night.', 'At this point, Luka Dončić was on his way to L.A. and pictures of him meeting with Rob Pelinka looking like he had slept as little as the average fan, surfaced.

And we can still watch him play, maybe just once in a while, when the worst shock is over and we’ve gotten used to him wearing that yellow jersey that probably hurts your eyes as much as your heart right now.', 'If this is what heartbreak feels like, let me never love again, fans agreed, connected by their common misery and the joy lost.', 'But the thing is, we will love again. Time will do its work as it always does, and we will feel better. In time, things will get easier and light will shine on you again.', 'But as of now, Mavs fans? Get the rage out.

He said he spent upwards of an hour texting and scrolling through his timeline as more details of the trade rolled in, which included the Jazz getting a couple of second-round picks and Jalen Hood-Schifino (it's still unclear what Utah's plans are for the second-year guard)."", ""The good news for Markkanen? He knew he wasn't going to be involved."", ""Due to when Markkanen signed his extension this summer, he isn't eligible to be traded until after the season."", '""It does feel good to kind of know that we\'re set for now,"" he said, with an emphasis on the ""for now"" part.', '""I know once the deadline\'s passed and we\'re going into summer, it\'s always going to be the same thing again,"" Markkanen said. ""But we\'re here now until somebody tells us otherwise.""', ""However, Markkanen still may have a few different teammates by Thursday's deadline."", 'Utah has already made three moves this deadline — consolidating draft picks, moving Patty Mills and Drew Eubanks to get a second-rounder, and then helping consolidate the Doncic-Anthony Davis deal — and is likely not done yet.', ""The now-usual suspects of John Collins, Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton are available, and don't be surprised if Utah moves on from one of its younger players if the right deal comes along. After all, the Jazz traded Ochai Agbaji last season. And, as Saturday showed, absoloutely no one is off the table anymore."", 'Walker Kessler was already coveted by the Lakers (and their fans) before Los Angeles moved Davis to get Doncic. Now, the team needs a big man more than ever.', '""I don\'t really listen to a bunch of outside noise, because you don\'t know what\'s gonna happen. It\'s unpredictable,"" Kessler said. ""But, obviously, I have my buddies texting me ""Oh, you\'re going to LA!\'""', ""It doesn't look like the Lakers would have the assets to intrigue the Jazz into making such a deal, but that probably could have been said last week about them getting Luka, so ..."", '""Even if they\'re not necessarily in rumors, everyone feels it,"" Kessler said. ""But for me, there\'s no point worrying about it, wasting sleep over it, because if it happens, it happens. You trust in God\'s plan and you go from there; there\'s no point stressing about it. There are so many rumors and things. I\'m sure there\'s a rumor I\'m going to Shanghai or something — who knows.""', ""To be fair, Kessler going to Shanghai still wouldn't be as shocking as the Doncic deal."", '""This time of year is crazy, and it really makes you sit down and think,"" George said. ""It\'s hard to talk about. I\'ve never seen nothing like that before.""', '']"
