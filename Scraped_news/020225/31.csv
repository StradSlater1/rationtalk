Google’s AI Super Bowl ad is wrong about cheese,https://www.theverge.com/news/604679/google-ai-super-bowl-ad-gouda-cheese,"['', 'The commercial shows Gemini wrongly stating that Gouda makes up ‘50 to 60 percent of the world’s cheese consumption.‘', 'by Emma Roth', 'Google just debuted a series of Super Bowl ads showing how small businesses use Gemini AI across all 50 states, but the cheese lovers out there might notice something a little off about its Wisconsin one. As spotted by @natejhake on X, the ad shows Gemini AI generating text that says Gouda accounts for “50 to 60 percent of the world’s cheese consumption” — a stat that isn’t quite accurate.', 'The cheese is undoubtedly popular in Europe, but the same can’t be said for the rest of the world. “While Gouda is likely the most common single variety in world trade, it is almost assuredly not the most widely consumed,” Andrew Novakovic, E.V. Baker Professor of Agricultural Economics Emeritus at Cornell University, tells The Verge.', 'Gemini doesn’t say where it fetched this information, but it doesn’t appear to be completely made up. A site called Cheese.com has the same stat (the legitimacy of which Redditors were debating about more than a decade ago).', '”I don’t think there is hard data to substantiate consumption of particular varieties of cheeses on a global scale,” Novakovic adds. “My guess is that Indian Paneer or the ubiquitous ‘fresh’ cheeses of South America, Africa, and western and southern Asia have far larger volumes than Gouda.”', 'As shown in the commercial, the fine print beneath Gemini’s response reads, “This is a creative writing aid, and is not intended to be factual.” But you’d think it would at least have a source to back it up, especially when the ad depicts a business owner using Gemini to fill out descriptions for their website.', 'When reached for comment, Google pointed The Verge to a reply from Google Cloud apps president Jerry Dischler on X. “Not a hallucination. Gemini is grounded in the Web — and users can always check the results and references. In this case, multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat,” Dischler said.', 'Last month, Google started building all its AI features into Workspace and also raised the price of its subscription.', 'Update, February 1st: Added a response from Google.', 'A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.', '© 2025 VOX MEDIA, LLC.

Google Workspace's Super Bowl Debut Showcases 50 Small Businesses That Use AI,https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/google-workspace-super-bowl-59-small-businesses-use-ai/,"['JANUARY 30, 2025', 'As recent backlash has shown, brands that use artificial intelligence in their advertising face a difficult road to consumers’ hearts.', 'But in Google Workspace’s first Super Bowl commercial, AI plays a supporting role to 50 small business owners, who take center stage in their own individual ads. That’s right—the search giant is buying 50 ads in Super Bowl 59. ', 'The “50 States, 50 Stories” campaign promotes Google’s AI model Gemini, which as of last year is built into all Workspace apps such as Gmail, Docs, Meet, and Drive. The ads showcase how real small business owners across the country are using AI through Google Workspace to transform their ventures. ', '', 'The campaign is unique among Super Bowl commercials, when many advertisers typically roll out one big ad during the national telecast. The 50 different ads will air in each of the 50 states during the Big Game on Feb. 9. Each local TV spot depicts a small business from its respective market, while a hero film running online compiles some of their stories.', 'They include a cattle ranch in Nebraska, a sign maker in Illinois, an architect in Massachusetts, a nuts and snacks retailer in New Jersey, a cheese shop in Wisconsin, a climbing gym in Utah. All of these businesses are “not just already using AI, but also customers who didn’t even know AI existed or what it could do for them,” said Harris Beber, global marketing lead for Google Workspace. ', '“If a boat builder who has handcrafted boats for 50 years can get value from AI, then any business can,” Beber told ADWEEK.', 'Super Bowl 59 Ad Tracker: Complete List of 2025 Super Bowl Commercials', '', 'Last year saw waves of backlash over AI-generated ads from brands like Coca-Cola, as well as frustration at companies such as Apple for overshadowing human efforts when promoting the technology. Google itself waded into hot water with its “Dear Sydney” ad released in July. ', 'This time, to address the “skepticism and fear” surrounding AI, Google chose to elevate human stories with its Workspace Super Bowl campaign, Beber said. ', '“There’s a gap in knowing how AI can help people achieve their ambitions,” he continued. “This is not about Workspace or AI, it’s about the small businesses that are the engine of the economy.” ', 'Google points to data from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showing that 99.9% of U.S. businesses–—over 33 million—are small businesses. Meanwhile, 40% of small businesses are using generative AI tools, nearly double the level from last year. ', '“Very rarely do small businesses get a chance to be on the biggest national stage. This is largely about their innovation and grit, and a small part is AI,” Beber added.', 'Google’s “50 States, 50 Stories” is not AI-generated, but the brand relied on a combination of AI and human craft to develop the ads. It used Gemini tools to narrow down thousands of existing Workspace customers and find potential candidates to feature in the campaign.', 'From there, Google’s team interviewed nearly 100 business owners—many of whom “were skeptical it was really Google reaching out to tell their story”—about their everyday challenges, Beber said. ', 'The 50 ads were shot over a period of 10 weeks. Daniel Mercadante directed the first four spots through production company Park Pictures and provided creative direction on the remaining films. Cntrl Studio handled production and post-production. ', '“Everyone in the ads is a real business, and it’s in their voice,” Beber said. ', 'The 50 customer stories can also be viewed on a Workspace website. After the Super Bowl, Google will repurpose the spots to run across digital media. ', 'For the rest of this year, Google Workspace will expand its marketing focus from small business owners to telling 100 stories about large enterprises. Its effort will also go global, with campaigns planned next for Brazil and Japan. ', 'Also during the Super Bowl, Google will air a national ad, as it did last year.
