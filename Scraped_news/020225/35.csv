EA is celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Sims by making the original game and The Sims 2 available to purchase once again. You can buy them separately — with expansion packs included — for $20 for the original game and $30 for the sequel. A 25th birthday bundle that includes both costs $40 on Steam, the Epic Games Store and the EA app on Windows. EA Play Pro subscribers also have unlimited access to the games on the EA app starting today. There's no word as yet on the re-releases coming to consoles or Mac."", 'Rumors emerged in recent days that the two games might once again be available to buy after EA released a teaser video that included user interface elements from them. Kotaku notes that the original game was only available on a physical disc format, while support for the sequel ended over a decade ago. Since then, players have had to jump through hoops to get them to run on modern systems. Maxis says it has been working to make the re-releases more compatible with Windows 10 and 11, but notes that it had to nix one expansion pack and some original songs from The Sims 2: Legacy Collection for licensing reasons.', 'I wish I still had the full-body scan I had captured of myself at the Millennium Dome in 2000 so I could properly play as a child version of myself in The Sims again (the avatar might still be on a floppy disc somewhere in my parents\' garage). Nevertheless, I\'m sure I and many others will be spamming the ""rosebud"" cheat to afford all the gear we want for our virtual homes, while some folks will surely be happy to send a particularly annoying Sim for a swim then delete the pool ladder, prompting an appearance from the Grim Reaper.']"
,https://www.thegamer.com/the-sims-worth-playing-2025-reflection/,"['Back in February 2000, I was a university student with a love of building and tycoon games. I’d spend my time erecting Greek, Egyptian and Roman cities, as well as my very own Sim City. At this point, the inhabitants of my digital worlds were mere pixels traveling along my carefully crafted roads, just going about their lives. Then The Sims came along and changed everything.', 'For the first time, it felt like I could dive into the windows of those Sim City 3000 skyscrapers and see who was inside. I was skilled at building a functioning neighbourhood, but now it was time to play with those who lived within. I remember it fondly, yet I’d not touched the original for years… until now.', 'Lighthearted multiplayer fun is what Nintendo console launches is all about.', 'Aching for a dose of nostalgia in the wake of The Sims 25th anniversary, I wanted to recapture those feelings of awe I remember from the first time I played, way back at launch. The re-releases of The Sims and The Sims 2 arrived just in time to scratch that itch.', 'These days we have it easy. Sims no longer get sad because you don’t have enough artwork on the walls, or you left a plate on the counter. No one dies without warning because they didn’t eat for eight hours, and most importantly, fire safety has considerably improved. Back then, it was a very different experience.', ""My overview of the re-releases starts with the tale of a fire in the Goths' kitchen. This was my first fire, but far from my last. I also burnt three bushes, two Sims, and one grill in a small incident involving some burgers, and then there was what I have named Ashgate."", 'I’d just created and furnished a brand-new house, complete with newly minted Sims. I wanted to take some screenshots and then start having babies - for science of course. I hit pause and tabbed out of my game to check my screenshots. When I tabbed back in, all of three minutes later, I was greeted by a room full of ash with an urn in the centre. It seemed that I had, in fact, failed to hit pause, and the aftermath was catastrophic. Only the fridge survived.', 'The first thing you buy in The Sims should be a smoke alarm, even if you don’t have a stove yet. It’s that important.', 'A fire had taken out my entire kitchen: appliances, counters, the trash can, even the dining table and chairs off to one side. Everything was reduced to ash, along with my entire household, who presumably had tried to save their 1990s formica table.', 'My colleague Gabrielle Castania wrote about how brutal playing this game is and the evidence was right in front of me. The Sims was Dark Souls before Dark Souls, but there’s also a huge amount to love about the retro technology, severe difficulty level, and furniture catalogue that looks like Walmart after a new series of Pokemon cards just went on sale.', 'As you admire the chunky CRT television and monitors, as well as the phones that have to be attached to the wall, you have to remember that this technology, now considered practically pre-historic, is the technology the game was built on, quite literally.', 'In real terms, this means that Sims are incredibly stupid. Even with full autonomy on, they don’t seem to understand how to make smart choices. I left Betty Newbie to talk to Mortimer Goth while Bob cooked some food, and she made an enemy out of him in 12 minutes. Turns out she’s even more socially inept than I am.', 'You can’t trust your Sims, the world has a tendency to burn, and if you get too sad then a freaky clown from a painting will pay you a visit. It’s this last part which is just one of the reasons why The Sims is still an enjoyable experience today - as long as you don’t look the tragic clown in the eyes.', 'If you can survive the everyday, mostly by missing a day of work and then hoping stupidity doesn’t stop you from missing it by accident the next day, you’ll find pure joy in the randomness of The Sims.', 'Watch out for bears. I found one eating cake from my trash can at 3am, before doing a little dance and then wandering off.', 'Since the expansion packs are included, you get to experience all their chaotic glory. Open up the mysterious box left on your doorstep to discover the joy of a portable hole. Visit Vicki Vampiress, Faerie Queen Mara, and Bonehilda. Have a birthday cake which houses scantily clad dancers. Go on holiday and befriend a yeti. You can even have a skydiving simulator in your backyard.', 'For every sensible option, like pursuing a career or having a family, there’s an equally bizarre one, like having a pet dragon or erasing a child from existence by sending them to military school for all eternity. All while Avril Lavigne, Marilyn Monroe, and Jon Bon Jovi Sims socialise together in the studio lot.', 'Once you’ve mastered the art of survival, then the world is your pet iguana.

"On The Sims' 25th birthday, let's celebrate the weird and wacky original that breathed life into a genre",https://www.vg247.com/the-sims-25th-anniversary-retrospective,"[""It's a tired talking point, but you really probably couldn't make a game like this today."", ""If, like me, you've been playing The Sims since more or less the very beginning, odds are good you were quite a small child when the first game came out, right? It was 25 years ago today, so if you were even old enough to play on a computer at the time you must be 30-ish by now, minimum; and of course there's the small fact that anyone who came to this series already middle-aged is probably really getting up there in years. Sims in this original outing didn't age, but we all sure do."", ""I promise there's more to this preamble than just a grim memento mori; the point I'm trying to drive at is that kids who grew up with the original Sims often recall being quite scared by the game at times. It's certainly true for me; much as I fell in love with The Sims from the first time I saw those classic live-action TV ads, I can distinctly remember being upset or frightened playing it sometimes."", ""I nearly cried the first time one of my Sim children got shipped off to military school for having bad grades (an especially terrifying concept to a 10-year-old), and I'm pretty sure I used to have to get my mum to sit with me whenever the musical sting came on that indicated one of the ghosts in the Goth graveyard was going for a midnight stroll. Others report a primal fear response even now when they hear the music cue which meant a burglar (or, with the Unleashed expansion pack installed, possibly just a raccoon) was approaching their Sims' home."", ""But, that's kids, right? I'm 34 now, with a deep love for all things horror, and there's no way that The Sims could still unnerve me."", ""Well. That's what I thought until I started checking out a few retrospective videos on YouTube ahead of today's big celebration. Less than five minutes in I saw a child Sim die of starvation and instantly remembered that oh, yeah, Sims 1 was quite harrowing, actually. Even if you can get over the visuals of a Sim in mortal distress, which have remained more or less consistent throughout the series, I'd forgotten just how awful the screams were. Those never really came back in any of the sequels."", 'The original Sims wasn\'t entirely devoid of euphemisms – ""punch bowls"" and ""bubble blowers"" already stood in for the kind of hard substances that would get the game slapped with too high an age rating; meanwhile, babies were made through lots of kissing, and your Sims needed to purchase a special item of furniture specifically to ""play in"" if they wanted to do anything more intimate with their romantic partner. But at the outset, The Sims contained some surprisingly dark and raunchy stuff, too.', 'On the opposite end of the spectrum from those painfully realistic death throes, you could hire a party entertainer who was so extremely clearly a stripper that all but the most sheltered of pre-teens were guaranteed to get the joke, even if you didn\'t technically see more than what\'s on display in a bathing suit. (Said ""cake dancer"", incidentally, is making their triumphant return to the franchise with The Sims 4\'s Blast From The Past event, which launches later today!) Adult Sims could walk around nearly-nude regardless of context and with nary a mod installed thanks to some very revealing default outfits, and I don\'t feel like I need to say too much about those go-go cage dance animations for you to get the idea.', 'A frequent criticism of The Sims franchise as a whole is that it\'s become increasingly sanitised as time has gone on, and going all the way back to the beginning, it\'s hard to argue with that. Plenty of the original\'s general sense of weirdness has been toned right down, in favour of a more idealised and upbeat take on what it means to be ""cartoonish"".', ""Realistically I'm sure there are a lot of reasons as to why this happens over time, but my first thought was that – unlike all of its sequels – The Sims was in the unique position of being developed without a strong sense of who its audience would be. This was, after all, an experimental architecture sandbox that shifted over the course of its development into a life simulator, a genre that hadn't really taken off up until that point in time. There was no script to follow, and to further compound the confusion, it wasn't particularly apparent who was going to want to play a video game (a thing allegedly only boys liked) which closely emulated the enjoyment of moving dolls around a dollhouse (a thing allegedly only girls liked). So really, it's not all that surprising that the humour and aesthetics of the original Sims tended to favour the interests of whichever demographics were programming computer games in California in the late 1990s."", ""And then, of course, The Sims found its audience. Most seismically, as we now know, it turned out that women and girls actually really like video games that recognise their common interests and lived experience; and The Sims became the best-selling PC game up to that point in time in large part due to its phenomenal success with female players, a marketable demographic that up until that moment hadn't been seriously entertained by most game publishers. Plenty of guys liked it too, of course, because it's a great game and because the idea of ruthlessly gendered hobbies is nonsense anyway; give men the privacy of a screen and it turns out a lot of them enjoy playing with digital dolls too, even if the potential for sex and violence is quite limited (although far from absent, as we've already seen)."", ""But of course, once you have an audience – especially an audience as hungry for more of what they like as those original Simmers were – commercial considerations kick in. The Sims is most popular with women and children, and even though we know those groups actually thrive on all this darkness and innuendo, you can't market that to the latter in particular. It becomes a bit of a catch-22, in which EA are fully aware that mods which introduce grimmer and raunchier content are uncontested fan favourites, but there's no way you can make that sort of thing a core part of the game without drastically reducing your ability to make actual sales. And we might not like to admit it, but without making a game that they can sell, eventually there'd be no Sims left at all."", 'So, in a way, the best thing to do is just appreciate what we had in The Sims 1: a weird and wonderful little experiment that led to great things, but probably won\'t ever be repeated – and certainly not by a company as corporate and small-c conservative as EA. But on the original game\'s 25th birthday, let\'s take a moment to remember that ""cosy"" games don\'t need to be too wholesome – indeed, The Sims 4 has revitalised its image somewhat of late by turning its attention to the twin matters of sex and death, and although that conversation is far more serious and earnest now than it was in The Sims 1, I still think this just makes my point for me.', ""I'm glad they didn't bring back those death rattle cries, though.

Across its four mainline games, numerous expansions, and vast array of quirky spin-offs, The Sims has left a significant impact on not just PC gaming, but the video game industry as a whole. To celebrate the series' 25th anniversary, developer Maxis has re-released The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on PC with Windows 10 and 11 support. According to The Sims' VP of Franchise Creative, Lyndsay Pearson, these re-releases have been a long time coming."", '""We had one laptop that floated around the office and didn\'t connect to the internet that we could open up and play The Sims 1 and 2 on. I joked with our studio\'s technical director all the time. I\'d show up in his cubicle every other day like, \'Is it time now? Can we do it now?\' We definitely know that there\'s a big love for those products, and I think reintroducing them would be quite a kick because players who\'ve never played those early generations of The Sims would actually be surprised by how different they are in a lot of ways.""', ""It's now possible to check out The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on PC and come to that conclusion for yourself.

People created houses and space and really off-the-wall stories early on, almost in spite of the simulation…It opened up totally different ways to play that I feel like you hadn\'t seen in games before. When people had thought of simulation before, it was very much about how to recreate a real-life thing. The Sims turned that on its head and said it doesn\'t actually have to be entirely real life.""', 'The Sims was a critical darling and best-seller, eventually overtaking Myst as the best-selling PC game ever. EA had a franchise on its hands, and supported The Sims with seven post-launch expansions. Eventually, Maxis created an even bigger and better sequel.', 'Released on September 14, 2004, The Sims 2 took the core of what worked so well about The Sims and expanded upon it. The Sims 2 was the first game in the series to be fully 3D, and deepened the number of customization and interaction options players had at their disposal while also cutting away some of the series\' more frustrating qualities. Sims gained the ability to create memories and have aspirations and lifetime wants, deepening the potential for emergent storytelling. Pearson believes ""interconnectedness"" is The Sims 2\'s greatest strength.', '""The Sims 1 was very much a simulation, but The Sims 2 took it to a different level. You introduced a lot of interconnectedness with the families because now they had lifetimes and family relationships…Introducing backstories and memories, it was this whole new layer of The Sims universe, and I think it changed the way that we think about The Sims\' world. Who are these little people that live there? Why? What are their motivations? What do they care about? What are they worried about?""', 'The Sims 2 was once again a critical and commercial success because it gave players the tools to ask and answer those questions. GameSpot\'s review of The Sims 2 highlights that it ""successfully took just about everything that was great about the first game and brought it up a notch."" From a development perspective, it\'s also Pearson\'s favorite in the series, as it was the first The Sims game she worked on from start to finish.', 'Between 2004 and 2008, The Sims 2 received eight expansions and 10 Stuff Packs. All that extra content made The Sims 2 a very robust, comprehensive package, but also made the jump from The Sims 2 to The Sims 3 all the more daunting for the developers. Maxis grappled with stripping back features with the intial version of each new game as they rebuilt from a new base. Pearson recalled the stress of knowing that each new addition to The Sims 2 would raise expectations regarding the content in potential sequels.', '""Any time we move on, we would love to have taken everything that was there and brought everything over. But the reality is that the core feature changes in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 changed so much about how everything worked that we couldn\'t really lift everything one to one…Even though it\'s really hard to go back to square one, it\'s an opportunity to look within the context of the engine, world, and conceits we\'ve built and reenvision them.""', ""A big reenvisioning happened with The Sims 3, released on June 2, 2009. Players could now explore an open-world neighborhood with their Sim, eliciting the feeling of being something like a god subtly directing these digital people's lives. Reflecting on The Sims 3, Pearson believes that its greatest strength was being an engine for organic storytelling."", '""The Sims 3 was much more about organic storytelling. I\'m going to take my Sim out into the world and see who they run into, and then I\'m going to make up a story from there. You could organically discover more story, which changes how you think about design and systems because you\'re driving players to do a different kind of thing.""', 'GameSpot offered similar praise to The Sims 3 in its review, complimenting how ""it offers the element of surprise, showing off its abundant charms through funny social interactions that make you want to be part of the improved virtual community."" It was another multi-million seller, receiving 11 expansions and nine stuff packs. It\'s the game in the franchise that I\'ve personally sunk the most time into because of how charming it felt to explore those open worlds with Sims I played a part in creating. Still, The Sims franchise continued to march on.', 'Around nine-and-a-half years passed between the launch of The Sims 1 and The Sims 3. Released on September 2, 2014, The Sims 4 has now been around as the primary Sims game for even longer than that. Pearson says the main goal of The Sims 4 is to make the individual Sims feel more like real people.', '""How do we make them more believable as little people? That encompassed everything from their personalities and traits to how they interacted with the other Sims around them and built relationships…The heart of The Sims is that relationship between me and my characters, as well as my characters to each other. Some players like to control every little bit. Some players like to sit back and see what happens. You have to accommodate both, and I think over the past 10 years in The Sims 4, we\'ve been able to experiment on both ends of that spectrum.', 'Initially, The Sims 4 didn\'t land quite as cleanly to players and critics. GameSpot criticized the fact that ""far too many series features have been frustratingly pruned or removed"" when reviewing the launch version of the game. Over 10 years, 17 expansions, 12 game packs, and countless more updates later, though, The Sims 4 is in a much better place as a live-service life sim.', 'Running concurrently with all of these mainline games were numerous--and often a bit bizarre--spin-offs. That effort started with The Sims Online, but has gone on to encompass titles like The Urbz: Sims in the City, the MySims sub-franchise, and The Sims Medieval. Pearson looks back at all of these spin-offs very fondly.', '""The reason The Sims did those spin-offs then and the reason we still think about things like that now is we\'re always trying to offer different entry points into The Sims for everyone. Maybe you\'re not totally interested in this big life sim that could feel daunting, and you want to start with something more cozy; that\'s what MySims was going after. I was always on the core Sims teams, but I worked closely with all of those teams over the years and was very jealous.""', ""As support for The Sims 4 continues, EA is embracing spin-offs again. Last November, MySims: Cozy Bundle launched on Nintendo Switch, and it's coming to PC in March. The mysterious Project Rene is also in development and does not appear to be The Sims 5. Speaking on Project Rene, Pearson had a quite bullish view on exploring the potential of standalone The Sims spin-offs."", '""There\'s nothing but opportunity for us to look at and ask how we could take this notion of the standalone spin-off in The Sims universe and explore it further. From a design side, how do we leverage all the stories we introduced in all these spin-offs to keep adding to our universal lore? We\'re always looking at a number of projects to create those different entry points to the franchise, and I think that it comes down to which game is going to talk to which audience at which time. Whether it\'s a Project Rene or the Cozy Bundle re-release, it\'s all about what we are trying to offer and how it plugs into the broader universe.""', ""The Sims is still trying to find new ways to surprise players 25 years on. Finally giving players an easy way to play MySims and check out the two games that kickstarted the franchise is one way to do that. Now that EA has embraced the series' past, it can look forward to games like Project Rene and continue work on what The Sims will become over the next 25 years."", '', '']"

How The Sims accidentally invented the cosy game genre,https://www.alternet.org/the-sims/,"['Ooboo Vroose Baa Dooo! That’s “happy birthday” in Simlish, the delightfully nonsensical language of The Sims. The life simulation video game franchise turns 25 this year, making me feel officially old.', 'Like many others, I grew up playing The Sims, oscillating between designing dream homes and orchestrating ideal careers, and trapping my Sim characters in a tiny block room, removing all the doors and watching the chaos ensue. For the more benevolent among us, The Sims was an endlessly rewarding digital dollhouse.', 'Game designer Sid Meier (creator of the Civilisation series) defines a video game as “a series of interesting decisions”. In most games, interesting decisions are about which gun to use or which party member to heal. The Sims’ interesting decisions, however, were far more mundane. “What clothes should I make my simulated human (typically a digital avatar of myself or my friends) wear?”; “Who should they date?”; and, most importantly: “Should I use the ‘rosebud’ cheat to give myself infinite money?”', 'The Sims went on to become one of the bestselling franchises of all time, with myriad sequels, expansions and an obsessed player base. While similar titles at the time, such as Black and White, had you playing as an omnipotent god, they were primarily strategy games based around controlling territory. What made The Sims special was its focus on emergent narratives – player-driven experiences where players could create their own stories.', 'Sul Sul! This article is part of a mini series from The Conversation marking 25 years of The Sims franchise.', 'Much of this focus is also present in what is now called the “cosy game” genre. These are games that focus not on conflict or challenges, but rather on creativity, exploration and personal expression.', 'Before Stardew Valley let us befriend a moody fisherman, Animal Crossing allowed us to be financially terrorised by a raccoon, and Unpacking made us cry over a box of kitchen utensils, The Sims showed us a new way to play. One where the biggest challenge was forgetting to pay your bills, and the most rewarding accomplishment was finally affording a pool (whose exit ladder may or may not just have mysteriously disappeared).', 'This normalised the idea that games didn’t need to be won to be fun. It was a shift in design philosophy that paved the way for later games that let players tend a farm, manage a café, or befriend ghosts without a game-defined goal.', 'The Sims was less about victory than it was about making your own fun – whether that meant imagining your future family life with your crush, or seeing how well you could build your Sim’s career from the ground up before succumbing to late-stage capitalism.', 'Many features that define the cosy game genre today trace directly back to The Sims. It popularised meticulous environment building and customisation tools, for example, from house layouts to outfit choices and suspiciously elaborate hedge mazes. This DNA is the bedrock of many modern cosy games, like Tiny Glade’s whimsical castle-building or pandemic hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ island growing.', 'The Sims was free from combat or major stressors (unless you count fire hazards and rogue Grim Reapers). No timers, no pressure – just vibes (unless you forgot to build a toilet, in which case the vibes would be bad). You could play at your own pace, which came to define other self-paced games like A Short Hike.', 'Looking for something good? Cut through the noise with a carefully curated selection of the latest releases, live events and exhibitions, straight to your inbox every fortnight, on Fridays. Sign up here.', 'Much of The Sims was about the relationships between the Sims themselves. They could get married, have children, make friends and even enemies. Instead of fighting for survival, Sims were fighting for their relationships.', 'This was augmented by a growing “machinima” fan culture, where players made short films and movies using in-game footage. These forms of emergent, social storytelling are a mainstay of modern gaming and meme culture, made even more prevalent by social media and the “share” buttons now on many game controllers.', 'Over the years, The Sims franchise has become a bastion for diversity, equity and inclusion. Most recently, that’s meant allowing players to create disabled and transgender Sims.', 'This provides more representation to players, and showcases the importance of cosy games for exploring an array of identities, values and stories. The move has even inspired copycats like the upcoming Inzoi, which provides even more realistic graphics and complex life simulation, building on the formula introduced by Sims creator Will Wright all those years ago.', 'For 25 years, The Sims has proven that games can be different. They don’t need conflict, challenge or even victory to be engaging. Sometimes, the real joy comes from designing an entire town, crafting a chaotic soap opera – or simply watching a Sim pace around a door-less room, gradually descending into madness.', 'Adam Jerrett, Lecturer, Faculty of Creative & Cultural Industries, University of Portsmouth', 'This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Every night--after I had finished my homework, dinner, and familial obligations--I would slink my way over to the family computer and live out my countless virtual lives in The Sims.

I decided it was time to take a vacation which, fortunately, pauses ""real life"" so your sims don\'t have to use a vacation day they don\'t have.', ""I paid 500 simoleons for the vacation package, followed by an extra 120 to check into the shoddy motel in the mountains I had chosen to visit. At these prices, you would think that meals would then be included. You'd be wrong. I discovered this as my family tore through plate after plate of 25 simoleon meals."", ""For the most part, my sim family enjoyed their stay at Penguin Acres Campground. My sim-son got the chance to throw snowballs and snowboard, while his parents soaked in the location's hot tubs. Though my mom sim repeatedly smacked the dad sim as he made a coy attempt to kiss her, he seemed to be happy when she agreed to a cuddle."", ""Upon returning home, I received a call from both of my sims' places of employment. Turns out, the game did count them as skipping out on work; I suspect this is because they left for vacation right as their carpools arrived. Fortunately, neither of them lost their job, but their work performance did take a small beating."", ""Considering they were both home for the day, the wife then asked the husband to go downtown with her, perhaps as a way to make up for dismissing his advances back at the campsite. It was then that I remembered how delightful visiting places is in The Sims. In some ways, I think outings function more smoothly than they do in The Sims 4. Though once again my wife sim rebuked her husband's suggestion that they make out in the restaurant booth (perhaps she just doesn't like PDA?), the pair did play footsie and enjoyed a 300 simoleon meal that ate through the rest of the family's savings."", ""Simply put, the original The Sims is an absolutely ridiculous game that is weirdly challenging--and I still absolutely love it. In many ways, it's a sort of endearing time capsule that reflects not only what video games looked like at the turn of the millennium, but what society looked like both literally and figuratively. I was charmed by the game’s janky, mismatched furniture, and even more so when, after giving Bella Goth a call, not a text, she told me she would come over right after she finished her favorite soap. I still love how sims have inherent interests in certain topics, ranging from the weather and politics to aliens and the '60s, and can adjust their conversations to appeal to others. It's incredibly easy to see how this game revolutionized life sims and spawned a legendary series that has thrived for a quarter century. In this way, this rerelease is the perfect way to celebrate The Sims."", 'Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

"‘The Sims’ Turned Mere Mortals Into Gods. Twenty-Five Years Later, the Addictive Computer Game Is Still Going Strong",https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/the-sims-turned-mere-mortals-into-gods-twenty-five-years-later-the-addictive-computer-game-is-still-going-strong-180985997/,"['SECTIONS', 'The audience for the trailblazing life simulation game has stuck around through new editions, expansion packs and designs to keep playing', 'Gregory Wakeman', 'Freelance Writer', 'When “The Sims” first hit shelves on February 4, 2000, the video game market was mostly populated by action titles like “Soulcalibur,” “The Legend of Zelda” and “Tomb Raider.” In these games, players had to fight their way past villains to complete missions and then finish the game itself.', 'In “The Sims,” though, players merely had to create virtual people, build their homes and manage their needs and dreams. They’d take them through different neighborhoods to meet other characters, help them achieve their ambitions, tackle their careers, guide them through friendships and relationships, and deal with tragedies.', 'Before its release, even the people at Electronic Arts (EA), the publisher behind “The Sims,” saw it as a risk, says David E. Dunning, a history of science curator at the National Museum of American History: “‘The Sims’ was unusual in that it didn’t give the player set goals with a clear way to ‘win.’” Instead, the open-ended style of play encouraged and rewarded the creativity of its players. There wasn’t a specific conclusion to work to. They could play it for as long as they wanted. The museum has in its collections a retail copy of the groundbreaking game.', '“‘The Sims’ is known as a sandbox game,” which allows freedom for its users, explains Dunning. Its creator, Will Wright, had previously had success with “SimCity,” a city planning game that was released in 1989, which saw players building their own cities by developing industrial and residential areas. “The Sims” was much different, though, as players controlled people and their actions, rather than the construction and infrastructure of cities. “The idea of a daily life sandbox game was new,” says Dunning. Just before it was released, Wright “predicted that the game would either be a complete flop or complete success and nothing in-between,” says Jesse McNamara, a “Sims” YouTuber from Middlesbrough, England, whose channel “Plumbella” has over 790,000 subscribers.', '“The Sims” was an instant hit among critics and gamers alike—not just in America, but around the world. Over the next few years it became the best-selling PC game series of all time. For Deligracy—a “Sims” YouTuber based in Melbourne, Australia, with over 1.2 million subscribers who asked to be referred to by her channel name—the universality of the game and its cartoonish aesthetic mixed with adult themes meant it appealed to a huge audience. The titular “Sims” speak their own invented language, Simlish, she notes. “So many games are targeted toward very specific audiences,” she says in an email. “But ‘The Sims’ is appealing to children and adults.”', 'Since the release of the original installment, “The Sims” has been followed by three main-series games, as well as dozens upon dozens of expansion packs and spin-offs. By 2019, “The Sims,” one of the best-selling video game franchises in history, had generated over $5 billion in sales. EA still reportedly makes $420 million a year, in part because of “the continued popularity of “The Sims 4,” even though the game was released back in 2014.', 'No wonder, then, that EA recently announced that it was rereleasing “The Sims” and “The Sims 2” on PC to mark the series’ 25th anniversary.', 'For many fans, the core of the game’s appeal is storytelling and the fun of building and creating. Deligracy got hooked on “The Sims” because she saw it as an extension of writing a story. “But instead of writing, I would ‘play out’ my stories. I loved escaping reality and stepping into my own, controlled life simulation.” The game provided McNamara a chance to push “the boundaries of societal norms” by acting out “some of the most bizarre storytellings” she could think of. If players wanted to build a family that consisted of a husband, wife and their two children, they could. At the same time, they could watch a character die of hunger or be set on fire, and then decide that was a success, too.', 'But while the open-ended structure, unique characters and quirky humor of “The Sims” initially attracted players to the game, Deligracy believes its “warmth and familiarity that is so different to other games” made them return to it again and again. “It’s become a cozy space or new dimension to escape to. … There is no other life simulation game that has the same amount of depth as ‘The Sims.’ As far as sandbox games go, it’s an enormous and joyful sandpit to play in.”', 'Maxis, the developer behind “The Sims,” has repeatedly piqued the interest of players by steadily releasing expansion packs in the 25 years since the first game was released. This additional content offered for purchase enlarges the base game and offers different clothes, hairstyles, items and worlds for people to explore. While the likes of “Half-Life,” “Xanadu” and “Populous” had used expansion packs before, “‘The Sims’ took it to a new level,” says Dunning, “releasing seven expansion packs for the first game. There are currently 17 expansion packs available for ‘The Sims 4.’”', 'It’s not been entirely smooth sailing for the franchise, though. When “The Sims 4” was released in 2014, fans and critics alike initially had a lukewarm response. They believed its gameplay was sluggish, its characters felt too similar, and it lacked the ingenuity and personality that had made the previous games so vibrant and alive. But over the next few years, various updates and expansion packs made “The Sims 4” more popular. In 2020, “The Sims 4” even surpassed the sales of the original game.', 'As a result, “The Sims” is arguably more popular than ever. While it might not be mentioned in the zeitgeist or among gamers as much as when it debuted, the ever-increasing community of “Sims” players—who regularly share their stories and creations online—proves that the game is still a focal point of many people’s lives.', 'The internet has been bringing “Sims” players together since the very beginning. “The ‘Sims 1’ forums were the dominant way to engage with content outside of the game,” says McNamara. “‘The Sims 2’ had an exchange where users could upload stories directly from the game, and ‘The Sims 3’ saw the rise in YouTube and Twitch content about ‘The Sims.’ ‘The Sims 4’ has brought so many new Simmers, and creators along with that, and the amount of time it’s been since the game dropped has meant that creators have had to get extremely creative with challenges.”', 'When it comes to surmising the impact of “The Sims,” it will forever be remembered for “putting simulation games on the map,” says McNamara. But its influence and importance to the gaming world and its users runs much deeper. “It also had a huge impact on diversity in gaming,” McNamara adds. She points out that it was one of the first games to depict same-sex relationships. Deligracy says that it has always aimed to be “inclusive, progressive and contemporary” in terms of its characters.', ""Get the latest on what's happening At the Smithsonian in your inbox."", 'Email Powered by Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Privacy Notice / Terms & Conditions)', 'Gregory Wakeman | READ MORE', 'A professional journalist for over a decade, Gregory Wakeman was raised in England but is now based in the United States.

There’s Still No Competing With The Sims 25 Years After Release,https://www.inverse.com/gaming/the-sims-25th-anniversary,"['Sul sul.', 'Even if you don’t play The Sims, you almost certainly know someone who does. The series is one of the most popular in video games, but it’s often overlooked by huge swaths of the gaming audience (which surely has nothing to do with the series’ audience being around 60 percent women). Yet even those who ignore The Sims have felt its influence on gaming, as it popularized the life sim genre that was relatively unknown at the time, but dominates the indie scene in particular today.', 'The Sims kicked the massively popular series off on February 4, 2000. For all its good-natured goofiness, the game that’s been a comfort to so many players over the years grew out of tragedy. In 1991, the Oakland-Berkeley Firestorm ripped through California’s Bay Area, burning homes along its path. One of those homes belonged to Will Wright, creator of SimCity, and later The Sims.', 'The Sims has all the drama of your favorite reality TV show.', '“When something like this happens, you get a big picture,” Wright told Berkeleyside in 2011. “Where do I want to live? What sort of things do I need to buy? You see your life almost as a project in process. When you’re embedded in your day-to-day life you don’t get that perspective.”', 'Those questions eventually turned into a pitch for The Sims, a game about building a life from the ground up, starting with the most mundane details. The Sims was an immediate success upon launch, even among people who don’t play many, or any, other games, which remains true of the series today. While it wasn’t the first life sim, it was far far the most popular game in the genre up to that point, and players responded to what felt like an entirely new kind of game.', 'Unlike fellow life sims Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, The Sims isn’t about controlling a single character. Instead, it’s about building an environment for a group of characters to live in and influencing, but not always directly dictating, how they interact with it.', 'This is what a dream home looked like in the year 2000.', 'Since Sims act independently of the player, they often converse with one another without player input. But players still need to know their emotional states in order to respond, which gave birth to one of the series’ most lovable quirks — Simlish. The characters in The Sims speak an invented language that’s focused on conveying emotion rather than meaning. Developing Simlish was reportedly a stressful affair for developer Maxis.', 'The developer first tried using musical instruments to represent Sims’ voices, according to The Verge, before bringing on improv actor Stephen Kearin. After multiple frustrating attempts of phonetically recording dialogue in languages Kearin didn’t know, before Kearin pulled on his improv experience, demonstrating a game called Foreign Poet, in which an actor recites a poem in gibberish but imbues it with as much emotion as possible. The sound team was impressed, and Kearin recorded the rest of the game’s male character dialogue the same way, bringing in friend and fellow improviser Gerri Lawlor to record the dialogue for female characters.', 'Another defining — and divisive — trademark of The Sims series is its inclusivity. On one hand, The Sims has a history of including diversity of race, gender, sexuality, and body type, paying more attention to how they’re represented in recent years. On the other hand, disabled characters are still totally absent, and modders have had to fill in the huge gaps in the series’ options for Black skin and hair.', 'When they weren’t being drowned by sadistic players, Sims had a pretty good life.', 'Even the now-famous kiss between two female characters during The Sims’ first E3 demo was reportedly an accident. Programmer Patrick J. Barrett III told The New Yorker that an early version of The Sims included gay characters, before the feature was cut. But Barrett unknowingly ended up basing his work on a design document that still mentioned gay couples and implemented them, after which publisher EA decided to keep the accidentally reintroduced option. In 2009, The Sims introduced gay marriage — which is still before it was legal in most of the United States — and in 2016 removed gender restrictions from cosmetic items and offered options to better represent trans characters.', 'The Sims series is still going strong today, even as some players aren’t happy about the decision to keep updating The Sims 4 instead of releasing a sequel. The Sims 4 just got an anniversary update and limited-time, in fact, bringing more than 70 new items to the game. A re-release of the first two Sims games also marks the occasion, letting players see just how much things have improved since the original.', 'As The Sims passes its 25th anniversary, it still has few direct competitors. While life sims are a huge deal right now, none have really matched the feel of The Sims, with its unique take on what simulating a life actually means. The closest anyone’s ever come may be out this year, with the generative AI-infested Inzoi and the considerably more interesting Paralives both aiming for a very Sims-like kind of gameplay. If any game is ever going to challenge the dominance of The Sims, it may be close at hand, but it’s telling that its taken 25 years to even get close to the king of life sims.']"

The Legacy Collection versions of these two iconic life sim games come stuffed with almost all of their respective expansion packs and a few small enhancements for modern setups and systems – but these are not full remakes or remasters.

Admittedly, EA has not at any stage said that these are remasters or remakes – it’s simply getting these classic games to work on Windows 10 and 11 systems and on your shiny, widescreen monitors. So I feel those criticisms are quite harsh. I’m seeing a few reports on forums and in Steam reviews (for The Sims 2, especially) of crashes.

Its humble beginnings were off to a good start, with EA and Maxis riffing off the success of SimCity and SimSafari to tighten its scope, look to the suburbs, and embark on a potentially risky pivot into unknown territory."", ""But 25 years later, with The Sims 4 still going strong, it's no doubt that EA struck gold by swapping to life sims. As one of the longest-running, best loved game franchises ever, you'd be hard pressed not to find someone with fond memories of it – past or present. But how did we get here from the days of Windows 98? I've picked out my top 10 standout additions to the game across its history that now stand out as milestone moments, each a stepping stone from risky venture to genre titan as we celebrate 25 years of Simming."", 'Blast to the past', ""After 11 years, The Sims 2 returns with a re-release on the EA App and Steam – and it's still as wonderfully janky as it was in 2004"", ""Many credit The Sims' 2000 launch with birthing the life sim genre as we know it today, refining and reframing more holistic management tools as seen in the best city builders to put a new challenge before players: to build and manage a digital life."", ""It's a simple enough premise, but it's one that stuck. The Sims gamified the normalcies of life with an oddly therapeutic touch, turning mundanity to intrigue as players navigated not only their own Sim families but those of resident townies and NPCs, uncovering existing world lore while creating their own stories and changing the landscape of the neighborhood – literally, too, thanks to Build Mode. The Sims provided the raw sandbox tools and let our creativity run wild with them, paving the way for the series' second generation."", 'The Sims 2 improved on its predecessor in many ways, but one that stands out is the introduction of preset stories in pre-made households. From map view, players could hover over base game families to read a short blurb about each of them, painting a Desperate Housewives-like portrait of their scandalous domestic dramas.', ""From them, we can learn that Don Lothario is wooing both Caliente sisters. Daniel Pleasant is having an affair with his housemaid. The Monty and Capps of Veronaville are constantly at one another's throats, much like their Shakespearean namesakes. Not only did preset narratives encourage more interactivity between player-made families and pre-made ones, it opened up the door for The Sims 2 as a narrative devising platform, with the ability to edit each blurb in accordance with the player's own influence on each household. Sadly, these preset family biographies were nixed in follow-up games, but The Sims 2 is when the franchise really started feeling like a story-led experience as well as a management sim."", 'Who knew a little thing like snow could make such a massive difference? The Sims 2: Seasons stands out as a momentous release in franchise history, proving the power of subtlety over kitsch when it comes to immersion factor. Seasons brought weather to Pleasantview and beyond, as well as functional outerwear and holiday celebrations to create a stronger sense of time passage in the lives of our Sims.', ""The implementation of seasonal weather also had knock-on effects for many other gameplay systems. A rainy day called for coats and boots, with Sims popping open an umbrella when stepping out in stormy weather. Neglecting to wrap up during winter meant your Sim could freeze to death in their swim suits, or die of heatstroke in the summer months if they didn't stay cool. Many expansion packs have made the jump between generations, but Seasons became such an intrinsic part of The Sims 2 that it's now seen as a must-have for The Sims 3 and 4 respectively. If that's not a milestone, I don't know what is."", ""Ask anyone what they miss about The Sims 3, and it's likely they will say the open world format. Doing away with the loading screens between neighborhood view and individual lots, The Sims 3 was the first time we could watch our Sims stroll around town with a pram, drive their cars around, or visit rabbit hole lots on foot."", ""The Sims 4 did retain the open world view, but it never quite caught up to The Sims 3's unbroken sense of immersion. Not to mention, the newest iteration of the game is still markedly lacking driveable cars. Guess bikes and horses will have to do for now, but if there's one thing I hope to see from EA now that there's no Sims 5 on the horizon, it's the return of cars – and fewer loading screens, please."", 'With the advent of The Sims 3 came one of the most important markers of modern tech being represented in the game: the mobile phone. Every teenage and older Sim came equipped with their own cellphone in their inventory, doing away with the necessity for the all-important wall or tabletop phone cradle that featured so heavily in Sims 1 and 2.', ""I remember being appalled by it at first, especially given how many self-imposed challenges I liked to embark on at the time that restricted my Sims' use of tech – the Decades Challenge, for example. But soon, I struggled to remember life before my Sims could play games on their phone while using the toilet, giving their Fun need a nice little buff in the process. Phones would become much more useful in later instalments, as I'll mention further down the list, but here's a shout out to one of The Sims 3's most daring improvements."", ""When body hair was added to The Sims 3, giving players the option to make their Sims look more like real actual people, it didn't feel like as much of a paradigm shift as it turned out to be. But really, we wouldn't have the more realistic Sim bodies and families we know and love in 2025 if not for The Sims 3: Generations championing the basics."", 'Inclusivity has become the lifeblood of modern Simming. Putting acne cream on teenagers in The Sims 2 was one of the more immersive, realistic gameplay elements of its era, but Generations upped the ante by offering not only more ways for players to see themselves represented in the game, but more ways to tell stories. All that shaggy body hair would also lead quite nicely into another Sims 3 era milestone that loved to howl at the moon…', 'Much as I love the Victorian gothic vampires in The Sims 2: Nightlife, my occult-loving heart truly felt seen in The Sims 3: Supernatural. While zombies and ghosts had been around since 2000, Supernatural adding werewolves, reworked vampires, witches, and fairies into the life state mix allowed players to put a hint of the unusual into their sleepy suburban towns – and boy, did it work a treat.', 'Werewolves turning at the stroke of midnight on a moonlit night, marking the first time lunar phases were added to the franchise. Fairies sleeping in their treehouses after shrinking down to the size of glowbugs. Vampires that hide in plain sight, no longer dressed head to toe in velvet gowns and ornate diadems, skulking around nightclubs in search of prey. Witches quietly passing down the art of magic to the next generation, more Charmed than Hocus Pocus. The Sims 3: Supernatural stands out as one of my favorite expansion packs in franchise history due to how cleverly each of the occult types is presented, doing away with the kitschy extremities of The Sims 2 to present a more refined take on how these beings might live among us in peace – or cause chaos, if they so wish. Sims 4 Werewolves, eat your heart out.', 'With the introduction of smartphones well established by the time The Sims 4: Highschool Years was released, there was only one thing left to do. Mirror the youth of today and give Sim kids more reasons to doomscroll!', ""The Trendii app allows teenagers and older Sims to thrift and sell their own outfit creations, giving highschoolers another way to earn a little money on top of their part time jobs and potentially pave the way for a future in fashion. We also have social media apps added, with Sims able to create their own profiles, gain followers, and carve a road to influencerdom. It sounds bizarre, but by giving teen Sims so many ways to utilize their mobile phones, Highschool Years might be the first time my teenage Sims felt like… well, teenagers. It was just the beginning; 2024's Lovestruck followed suit with the addition of a dating app, and with so many app options out there ripe for the reimagining, I don't imagine Cupid's Corner will be the last."", ""We do not speak of the darkest time in The Sims 4 history when toddlers were markedly absent from the game and babies would age into 7-year-old children overnight. But perhaps Growing Together is an apology for that, proving a milestone achievement on EA's quest to deliver expansive gameplay opportunities at every stage of Sim life."", 'Infants were added as an interim age group between babies and toddlers in one of my favorite Sims expansions of 2023. They don\'t do very much except poop, cry, and try to waddle about, but there\'s something special about seeing realistic infancy in a game that has always put immersion at the heart of its intentions – whether or not it followed through. Having a chance to watch babies reach their milestones is made all the more worthwhile for the knock-on effects to their toddler stage, allowing them to become more confident and developed young people who don\'t need half as much help using the potty or learning to talk. No more ""grew up poorly"" traits for you, then.', 'This might not be a milestone moment in a Sims pack, but it has changed the course of the series as we once knew it. As we enter 2025, The Sims is embarking on an exciting, albeit strange, new adventure. EA announced last year that The Sims 4 is to exist in perpetuity for the time being as the central Sims product, with no plans for The Sims 5 in the pipeline.', ""What does this mean? Well, for now, it means we won't have to fork out another few grand for new expansion packs for a brand new Sims generation, because The Sims 4 seems here to stay. EA has fought long and hard to get the game up to scratch, even if it took a few years to catch up to the community's expectations. All that's left to do is look ahead to the 25 years stretching out before us, and wonder what could possibly come next. Hint: cars, please."", 'Could inZOI finally beat The Sims at its own game?']"

Relatable, honestly – maybe a bit too much, as most players are seemingly looking to escape the difficulties of real life.
