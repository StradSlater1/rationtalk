I know the Panama Canal well – here’s why Trump wants it,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/26/why-donald-trump-wants-the-panama-canal/,"['The new US president has vowed to ‘take back’ the waterway, but there’s much more to this modern wonder than meets the eye', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'When I first travelled to Panama City in 2012, the big real estate story – in a town obsessed with real estate – was the Trump Ocean Club. My driver from Tocumen airport, Roberto, had chauffeured its namesake the previous year.', '“He came down to inaugurate the Club, a hotel, condo and office development,” he told me, “Ivanka was living here some of the time, running his businesses. I drove Señor Trump all round town.', '“There’s the building now. Amazing, no?’ The coastal highway wove past a narrow peninsula crammed with shiny high-rises called Punta Pacifica. The 70-floor, sail-shaped building at its centre was the Trump Organisation’s first named brand development overseas. The boss’s exposure on the US Apprentice had made licensing the Trump name a lucrative business. Then-president of Panama, Ricardo Martinelli, who took part in the ribbon-cutting ceremony at Trump Ocean Club, was as excited about the £266million project as his VIP guest.', '“I would like to thank Donald Trump for coming to Panama and allowing this wonderful building to have his name,” Mr Martinelli said.', '“This makes Panama very proud.”', 'I asked Roberto what Trump was like.', '“He was good to work for, really down to earth. A regular guy. He was kinda funny.”', 'Cut to January 2025. The hotel at the Trump Ocean Club, at 284m still the tallest building in Central America, is now the JW Marriott Panama. The development has been linked to money-laundering allegations involving Russian gangsters, drug cartels and people-smugglers, although there’s no evidence the Trump Organization or members of the Trump family broke the law or knew of the criminal backgrounds of some of the tower’s brokers, buyers and investors.', 'Former President Martinelli meanwhile has just gone on trial for alleged money-laundering in an unrelated case.', 'Señor Trump has begun his second term as US president, vowing in his inaugural address to “take back” the Panama Canal, “a foolish gift that should have never been made”. He alleges that “American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form and that includes the United States Navy”.', 'The US built the canal in the early 20th century. The received myth is that the French failed and Americans stepped in, Hollywood-style, to finish the job. Panamanian historian Marixa Lasso, author of Erased: The Untold Story of the Panama Canal, makes the point that “the Canal was not built over nothing. It was built over an old route that had connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for centuries.”', 'To build the Canal, she says, “old Panamanian towns along the interoceanic route were eliminated and their inhabitants expelled to create a Canal Zone without Panamanian residents and with a completely new urban geography of US-controlled towns. Through this erasure, the canal and its Zone became artificially disconnected from Panama and Panamanians.”', 'Following years of protests, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control. In 1999, Panama took full ownership of the canal, which would remain neutral and open to vessels of all nations. About 40 per cent of US container traffic passes through the waterway. Tariffs are based on vessel size, and priority slots can be purchased via auction. These have a base price of $200,000 USD (£161,000), but slots have sold for as much as $4million during particularly congested periods.', 'Trump concluded the Panama section of his inauguration speech with the claim that “China is operating the Panama Canal”. Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino rejected Trump’s words in their “entirety”, insisting there is “no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration”. Even as he spoke, Panamanian authorities were beginning an audit of Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based firm that operates ports at either end of the canal.', 'As well as a global trade conduit, the Panama Canal is one of the modern wonders of the world and a tourism magnet. Every year, more than 200 cruise ships pass through – a fraction of the 13,000-plus vessels that make the transit, though the number fell in 2023 and 2024 due to droughts caused by climate change and weather patterns related to the El Niño phenomenon.', 'It’s a trip that I’ve made three times, in 2012, 2014 and 2018. On the second occasion I travelled to the small town of Gamboa to make a half-transit by ship back to Panama City. You don’t see the canal from the main road, but there are hints. Peeling signage from the American era. A long cargo train bearing the name of the waterway. A tall chainlink fence topped with razor wire surrounding an enormous crane. I caught the silvery flash of a mighty river close to the entrance of a national park called, tellingly, Soberanía – Sovereignty.', 'I was travelling with Roberto again, and a guide, Gabriel. As we sipped our morning coffees, I asked them about the canal, and America’s extended stay as overseers.', '“We weren’t allowed anywhere near it when we were kids,” said Gabriel, who was born in 1984. “We grew up with a sense that we had invaders living among us. The Canal Zone was off limits.”', 'Roberto said some of his family had worked for the Americans and it had affected him differently. “We did well out of the canal, but I still remember a lot of places where we weren’t allowed to go – barracks, army clubs, airbases and some residential areas.”', 'They agreed that the watershed date was Jan 9, 1964, when 21 Panamanians were killed by US soldiers following a standoff between local students and “Zonians” – American expatriates living in the Canal Zone.', 'We passed a French cemetery, “for the 22,000 who died attempting to build that first canal”, said Gabriel. On crossing an old ironwork bridge, suddenly it was there, without fanfare or so much as a sign, the Panama Canal. All around was deep green forest, with the rising sun slanting on to the still water.', 'My excursion ship, the Pacific Queen, was fully loaded with German, Japanese and American tourists, as well as an assortment of Latin Americans. This made for a less than peaceful journey, with every factoid and anecdote delivered in four languages over the tannoy.', 'But this didn’t detract from the marvels we saw along the way, including the Culebra (or Gaillard) Cut, where engineers blasted apart a mountain on the continental divide; the mighty Pedro Miguel and Miraflores lock systems and the retro-futuristic Mitsubishi electric “mules” that steady vessels; and the Bridge of the Americas across which, I was informed in several languages, the Panamerican Highway runs north to Alaska and south to Darién. But the most remarkable view was fore and aft: the line of huge ships gliding quietly along the canal – its sides only feet away from their hulls – framed by forest.', 'Flitting, hooting and hanging around the canal are its wild tenants. Because the Americans treated the area as a secure, quasi-colonial no-man’s land, 553 square miles of land beside the waterway were militarised. Since the Panamanian government took control, limited development in the area has ensured it thrives as a wildlife haven. I saw cormorants, kingfishers, sandpipers, egrets and little blue herons. In the locks, pelicans and egrets perched on the bank waiting for the huge doors to open and release a new batch of fish. Birds often ride on passing ships and there have been bigger stowaways, including ocelots.', 'When it officially opened on Aug 15, 1914, the Panama Canal shaved weeks off the journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The voyage from New York to Guayaquil in Ecuador was reduced by 7,405 miles. Today, it takes a ship about 22 days to get from Panama’s Caribbean coast to its Pacific coast via the alternative route, the Strait of Magellan – that’s a long time for bananas or frozen goods, and a lot of fuel.', 'When we reached the Pacific, dozens of ships were waiting in the bay: dry bulk and refrigerated vessels, car carriers, oil and chemical tankers, a couple of cruise ships, and a fleet of tuna fishing vessels at anchor, waiting for the season to begin. Ships often have to wait days for their slot in the system, queuing like cars in a busy car park.', 'For centuries the isthmus of Panama has played a crucial role in European and American relations. It was here, on Sept 25, 1513, that Spanish conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa first saw the “South Sea” – the Pacific Ocean. Panama City, founded six years later, is one the oldest cities in the Americas; the atmospheric ruins of the original settlement, in the suburbs of the present-day capital, are a Unesco World Heritage Site. When silver was discovered in Alto Peru, the isthmus was the shortest way to transport it to Spain.', 'It was also the fast track for Americans hoping to cash in on the California Gold Rush. By the spring of 1849, some 40,000 miners had gone west, many using steamer ships to travel from the East Coast of the US to Panama and on to San Francisco. In 1855 a railway opened, linking Colón on the Atlantic side with Balboa, close to Panama City on the Pacific. Hundreds of thousands of prospectors used the line, which carried the heaviest volume of freight per unit length of any railway in the world – and contributed hugely to Panama’s GDP and development.', 'I rode on the line in a wood-panelled vintage carriage to visit Portobelo and Colón. Both towns were a world away from Panama City’s glittering steel-and-glass towers. Portobelo’s colonial-era fort is Unesco-listed and the town has a certain decaying allure; it was the main exit point for Peruvian silver and an important entry gate for African slaves. Colón, despite being the modern gateway to the canal, has reaped meagre benefits. Slums ringed the city, and even in the downtown area there were balconies hanging off jerry-built apartment blocks. Tourism on this side of the canal is either on islands, away from the shanty towns, or overlooking the canal.', 'I jumped into a small boat to explore the Chagres River and the edges of Lago Gatún, the 146-square-mile artificial lake created in 1913 to provide the millions of litres of water necessary to operate the canal’s locks every time a ship transits. The breeze was gentle, tropical; the landscape, a lime green slope rising to a deep green forest. Parakeets passed overhead in long arcs. Down below, an American crocodile flipped and dived. I could see, without binoculars, sloths and capuchin monkeys. It’s all quite magical and peaceful – and then a 150,000-ton container ship drifts past in the background, which, at least for the visitor, never stops being surreal.', 'For non-cruise travellers, most visits to Panama end in Panama City. The airport is Central America’s busiest by some measure – thanks to commerce generated by the canal. The capital’s Casco Viejo – historic quarter – is nothing like the Trumpian business district. The low-slung, ochre-hued wedding-cake buildings recall Cartagena in Colombia or New Orleans’ French Quarter. Refurbishment is ongoing and ubiquitous. Only the facade remained of a Jesuit church, its windows full of sky. Scaffolding had cut off entire blocks, with huge props supporting fragile brick-and-adobe walls.', 'A high standard was set in 2013 when the American Trade Hotel reopened on Plaza Herrera. The 1917 former apartment block turned department store is now one of the most elegant properties in Latin America, with its all custom-made French and Mexican furnishings, geometric tiled floors, and bold black and white decor. The hotel was a US venture; its business centre was a branch of the New York bank that financed the canal.', 'This is part of the cultural – and potentially geopolitical – conundrum. Many Panamanians have relatives in the US. They study there. Florida State University has a local campus. They speak American English more fluently than any other Latin Americans. They like big cars, thick pizzas and Starbucks. Baseball is the national sport. The dollar is the main currency. People I met liked or loved America, if not always its foreign policies.', 'Panama City has long been a melting pot. During a five-day visit in 2018, I met American businesspeople, Venezuelan guides (the city is one of few places where Venezuelan exiles have largely been made welcome), Argentine grill chefs, French waiters and Colombian baristas. Restaurants and bars serve German beer, Thai curry, moules et frites, tacos, burgers and Panama’s very own much-mythologised Geisha coffee. It reminded me of the song ‘Plástico’ by Panama’s finest singer-songwriter Rubén Blades, in which he summons the “Latin conscience”, naming all the nations of Hispanic America. Each one responds, “Presente” – or “Here, sir” – in school-register fashion.', 'Speaking to me this week, Marco Gandásegu, CEO of leading ecotourism firm Ancon Expeditions, says Panama will have to be unrelentingly internationalist in its diplomacy in light of Trump’s pronouncements.', '“While Trump’s threats to ‘take back’ the Panama Canal are based on unsupported fabrications, we take them seriously. We don’t foresee an invasion or occupation, but we must expect economic pressure to align Panama with his expansionist goals.', '“These may not just be related to the Panama Canal. Other US geopolitical, security and economic concerns in Panama include the flow of illegal migrants through the Darien Gap and the closing of the Cobre Panama copper mine, mandated by Panama’s Supreme Court, where there are important US stakeholders – and Chinese, by the way.', '“We need to be efficient in communicating, educating, and harnessing global support through international relations as we accomplished in the 60s and 70s to regain our sovereignty, precisely from the US which controlled the Panama Canal during the better part of the 20th century.”', 'In fact, concludes Gandásegu, the current furore around Trump’s statements is causing tourism to “spike up”.', 'The majority of visitors will want to set eyes on the famous – and highly valuable – waterway. In 2024, the canal generated more than £4 billion in total profits. According to a study by IDB Invest, 23.6 per cent of Panama’s annual income is generated from the canal and companies that provide services related to its operations. These are the numbers Trump will have in mind when he exerts pressure in the coming months, or days.', 'Close to the Palace of Herons – the Panamanian president’s official residence – are two plazas – one dedicated to the French connections, the other to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who proposed a canal back in 1534. For locals, such historic sites serve as reminders that empires have risen and fallen, colonists have come and withdrawn. As Lasso says, “For Panamanians the canal symbolizes the country’s deep history. Panamanians are the descendants of the labourers who built and maintained that path, from the Spanish colonial roads to the 19th century railway, to today’s Canal.” Spain, the Viceroyalty of Peru and Colombia have all asserted their control over Panamanian territory. The US century – the period between 1914-1999 when the canal and zone were under Washington DC’s control – already belongs to this layered past.', 'When asked in Davos on Wednesday if he was concerned the US would invade Panama, President Mulino responded, “Be serious, be serious”. For Alonso Illueca, Associate Professor at Panama’s Santa María La Antigua University, the main risk is that Donald Trump will make decisions inspired rather than informed by history.', '“Panamanians should feel frightened by president Trump’s expansionist threats. In his inauguration speech and prior to addressing his Panama ‘claims’ he referred to president William McKinley, whose presidency was marked by US ascent as a world power. During that time the US expanded its influence to the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii and Cuba.', '“He also presided over the signature of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty (1901) which… cleared the way for the US in its geopolitical competition with the UK to build a canal in Central America.', '“Trump proclaimed that he wants to emulate McKinley and that the Panama Canal is the first step. With this, he seeks a return of power politics in international relations – similar to the one that reigned during the 19th century – and in detriment of the rules based international order.', '“This should be of particular concern to Panama, a country which reconquered its canal and sovereignty with the assistance of international law and multilateralism, two creatures of the rules based international order that now Trump is disregarding.”', 'What would Panama do if the unthinkable – a US invasion and annexation of the canal – were to unfold? What would, or could, its Central and South American friends do? How would Europe, and China, respond? The global silence in response to Trump’s claims has been deafening. The down-to-earth, regular, ‘kinda funny’ guy is still the boss.', '', '', '', '', '']"

According to the agreement, the US could intervene militarily if the canal’s operations were disrupted by internal conflict or a foreign power. Today, more cargo than ever runs through the canal than it did during the years of US control.', 'US President Donald Trump’s repeated and publicly stated desire for the US to retake control of the key waterway has already caused a diplomatic stir, with Mulino repeatedly stating that that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal is not up for debate.', 'Mulino said Sunday he doesn’t think there is a real risk that the US would use military force to retake the canal.', 'Mulino also said Panamanian authorities are carrying out an audit on a company linked to China that operates two terminals around the canal.', '“We have to wait until that audit ends before we can reach our legal conclusions and act accordingly,” Mulino said.', 'The company in question is the Panama Ports Company, part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings. Hutchinson Ports is one of the world’s largest port operators, overseeing 53 ports in 24 countries, including for other US allies such as the UK, Australia and Canada.', 'As CNN has previously reported, Hutchison does not control access to the Panama Canal. Workers at their two ports only load and unload containers onto ships and supply them with fuel. Three other ports in the vicinity of the canal are operated by competing companies providing similar services.', 'Mulino also said Panamanian authorities spoke with Rubio about the possibility of expanding a migrant repatriation flight program to remove foreign nationals who don’t have the legal basis to be in Panama, insisting that the US would have to shoulder the costs.', 'Asked to clarify if migrants would come to Panama and subsequently be transferred to their respective countries, Mulio said, “Yes. Exactly … We can do that, without a problem, under the total cost of the US. Panama won’t invest a single dollar in it.”', 'The program, signed in July, is aimed at reducing irregular migration through the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada.', 'Mulino said Sunday that those repatriated could include migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and other countries.', 'A disabled veteran bought solar panels to reduce energy costs, but he could lose his home after learning that the financing he thought he was approved for fell through.

Headache For U.S. In Latin America — Here’s How A Tiny Panama Is Giving Sleepless Nights To Washington,https://www.eurasiantimes.com/headache-for-u-s-in-latin-america-heres-why/,"['Technically speaking, U.S. President Donald Trump’s allegations cannot be proved that China controls the Panama Canal and that Panama charges exorbitant transit fees for using the  50-mile waterbody connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year. ', 'However, seen through geopolitical and geoeconomic prisms, Trump’s points underscore China’s increasing dominance in the global maritime trade in terms of volume, shipbuilding activity, and construction and ownership of ports around the world. And this dominance seems to have serious security implications.', 'Two of the\u202ffive ports\u202fadjacent to the canal, Balboa and Cristóbal, which sit on the Pacific and Atlantic sides, respectively, have been operated by a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings since 1997.', 'Hutchison Holdings is a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that does not come under Beijing’s control under Hong Kong-laws, unless one resorts to a far-fetched argument that as a Hong Kong company, it is ultimately subject to Chinese jurisdiction and that it co-owns a real estate joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, one of China’s largest defense companies.', 'It is true that the U.S. started building the Panama Canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. Washington wanted to cut the transit time for American commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.', 'The U.S. completed the construction of the canal in 1914 and kept it under its control until December 31, 1999.  It had to relinquish control  under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1978, which Trump now calls “a terrible mistake.”', 'Since then, the Panama Canal Authority has held exclusive control over the operations of the waterway. However, under the treaty, the U.S. retains the “permanent right” to defend it by military means.', 'Trump is also not right in saying that  Panama charges to transit the canal “exorbitant”  fees, which are reportedly said to be lower than for similar shipping chokepoints elsewhere in the world, though they have increased because drought has lowered the water level in the canal and the number of ships that can pass through.', 'Panama charges container ships about $100,000 to $300,000 per transit — which is said to be just a fraction of what the Suez Canal charges, even before the recent shipping disruptions in the Red Sea.', 'However, when the factors of geopolitics and geoeconomics are taken into account, Trump seems to be voicing a global concern at Chinese President Xi Jinping’s introduction of “the Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road” and its manifestation of China’s overseas port investment and construction activities all over the world.', 'According to available data, Chinese entities have acquired varied equity ownership or operational stakes in as many as 129 port projects (9 of which are inactive). Apparently, China operates or has ownership in at least one port in every continent except Antarctica.', 'Chinese companies are said to have invested US$11 billion (A$17.7 billion) in overseas port development from 2010–19. More than 27% of global container trade now passes through terminals where leading Chinese firms hold direct stakes.', 'A discerning study reveals that “between 2010 and 2019, Chinese companies invested roughly $11 billion into overseas ports. China’s two main SOEs involved in port infrastructure are COSCO Shipping Ports, the world’s largest shipping company and port terminal operator, operating and managing 371 berths globally, and China Merchants Ports, the sixth-largest port terminal operator globally. Additionally, the China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC) is the biggest port design and construction enterprise in the world. It shapes more than 70 percent of the national standards for the water transportation industry and designed 7 of the top 10 ports. State support to Chinese shipping companies in their endeavors totaled an estimated $132 billion between 2010 and 2018”.', 'That these projects often come with unsustainable financing terms, a lack of transparency, and a clear disregard for environmental and social norms is a usual criticism of the Chinese policy. There seem to be some elements of truth in them, evident from the accumulation of more than $8 billion in debt to Chinese SOEs, of which $1.1 billion was used to construct Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka.', 'In 2017, when the Sri Lankan government was struggling to repay its debts, it had to agree to lease the port to China for 99 years in exchange for debt reduction.', 'Be that as it may, the fact remains that China’s emergence as a maritime and shipping power is central to Xi’s ambition for global economic dominance. China needs assured access to key trading routes for its imports and exports.', 'Controlling ports in this context adds to its maritime power because it enables China to create economic zones in other countries that give port owners and operators privileged access to commodities and products. This has been attempted in countries such as  Togo, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka.', 'There are also military implications.', 'China is seeking to “weaponize” the Belt and Road Initiative. Incidentally,  14 of the 17 ports in which it has a majority stake have the potential to be used for naval purposes. It is feared that ports with drafts between 12 and 15 meters would be able to accommodate many Chinese naval vessels, including destroyers (which have 6.5 meters of draft), frigates (6 meters), aircraft carriers (11 meters), and cruisers (6.6 meters).', 'The U.S. is particularly worried as reportedly 90 [ninety] percent of its military cargo travels by commercial ships, giving port operators insight when the government steps up operations in certain places.', 'Port ownership can provide clues into how the U.S. government screens cargo for security risks, which could make it easier to evade these efforts. No wonder why legislation has been initiated in the U.S. Congress to require the Defense Department to monitor China’s influence over ports.', 'But more than anything else, the U.S. is worried about the way China has entered Latin America aggressively, becoming the region’s top trading partner.', 'China’s state-owned Cosco shipping giant has recently purchased a 60% stake in Peu’s deepwater mega-port called Chancay for US$1.6 billion, which gave the company exclusive use of the port for 60 years.', 'Similarly, last year, China Merchants Port Holdings signed a letter of intent with Portos do Paraná, the Brazilian state-owned enterprise, to expand Paranaguá Container Terminal, the second-largest terminal in South America. China is also expected to invest in even more Brazilian ports, as 22 terminals are scheduled to be auctioned before the end of 2025.', 'But what seems to be disturbing the U.S. the most is Panama’s increasing openness to China in recent years. It may be noted that in 2017, Panama broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established formal relations with China, a huge win for Chinese diplomacy.', 'Significantly, Panama became the first Latin American country to join China’s signature Belt and Road Initiative.', 'And it was Panama that showed the way to fellow Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras to sever ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.', 'Apparently, Chinese companies, both private and state-owned, have strengthened their presence in Panama through billions of dollars in investments, including a cruise terminal, a railway line, and a bridge to be built over the Panama Canal.', 'It is understandable why Trump is angry. China may not  “own” the Panama Canal, but the  “package of Chinese activities” in Panama has become a matter of deep concern to the U.S.', 'Copyright ©2021. The EurAsian Times.

The FMC has received complaints that some Chinese companies are getting reimbursed for canal transits, while American companies pay the ocean carriers for the transits and associated costs and are not being reimbursed.', '“I find the entire practice alarming, that canal tolls would be refunded for any reason whatsoever, especially when Panama has a neutrality contract or neutrality clause in their treaty,” said Sola. “So I think that [Panama’s government] really needs to take a look at that.”', 'Other issues include China’s no-bid contracts to operate two ports on either side of the canal, as well as other canal infrastructure projects. Hutchison Ports PPC manages and operates the Port of Cristobal on the Atlantic side of the canal and the Port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the canal.', '“After not paying for 20 years, they renewed the contract and pay $7 million a year for both ports. These assets are definitely worth $5 billion to $7 billion, so the people of Panama are not getting anything for these two ports to be operating there,” Sola said.', 'Trump has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. In a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Panama President José Raúl Mulino said the canal was not a gift from the United States. “We reject in its entirety everything that Mr. Trump has said. First, because it is false, and second because the Panama Canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama.”', 'The U.S. Senate held a hearing on Tuesday about trade and security issues at the canal, at which Sola testified, with several Republican lawmakers pushing for an aggressive stance from the U.S. backing Trump’s position.', 'During the CNBC interview, Sola issued a warning about China’s growing influence over Panama.', '″I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States,” he said. “One of the major problems is, we have not been supporting U.S. companies in Panama for a long time. We support other types of initiatives, but supporting a U.S. company wanting to do infrastructure, I haven’t seen it in a long time. I’ve seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there.”', 'Sola said he also hopes a proposed train line that will link Panama with Costa Rica will have an open bid process. “I know that there are countries from all over the world that are interested in developing that, including the U.S.,” said Sola.', 'Sola said there are steps the U.S. can take to retaliate if it sees unfair practices at the canal and ports.', '“If [the Panamanian Government is] going to give subsidiaries to Chinese vessels or subsidiaries to Chinese ports we have to see what’s in the best interest of the U.S. shipper and to ship U.S. goods. If that does become an issue, we do have all options on the table when it comes to business,” he said.', 'Sola was referring to the FMC’s ability to issue substantial fines to a foreign government and prohibit the entrance of foreign flag vessels at U.S. ports when the FMC finds laws or practices harmful to U.S. shipping under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920.', 'The FMC can issue substantial daily fines to the Panamanian government and bar Panamanian-flagged vessels from calling at U.S. ports. The Panama flag is the second-most registered flag in the world because of its easy online registration, cheaper foreign labor, and the fact that vessel owners pay no income taxes.', 'The Panama Canal’s role in global shipping has increased given the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority’s revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017.', 'Corruption remains the biggest problem in Panama, according to Sola, and it is an issue the Trump administration and Congress need to revisit.', '“I believe the Chinese have a better ability to discuss a lot of these things with their Panamanian counterparts than the United States do. What I mean by that is U.S. companies are hindered drastically by the Foreign Corruption Practice Act. So if the lights go out and I have to call somebody at 12 o’clock at night to come over and turn on my terminal; I cannot buy that person pizza under the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act. We definitely have to ease some of our regulations so that we’re able to able to compete internationally.”', 'In August 2024, Sola, along with then-FMC Chairman Daniel Maffei, traveled to Panama to meet with government and Panama Canal officials to discuss drought mitigation projects and the increase in tolls associated with crossing the canal. Sola said he is optimistic that Mulino will work well with the Trump administration.', '“The President of Panama did impress me as we were waiting in his office to meet with him, myself, with our official delegation, and he was 30 minutes late because the election in Venezuela happened the day before, and he was breaking relations with Venezuela. So he seems to be a pro-U.S. person.”', 'Sola said in that meeting, they also discussed the soaring tolls being charged by the Panama Canal Authority.', 'In January, the Panama Canal Authority increased tolls to traverse the canal this year, in addition to other charges and services. A vessel can pay over $1 million per transit as a result.', '40% of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually.', 'Got a confidential news tip?

Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/26/panic-and-defiance-in-panama-after-trump-threatens-to-take-back-canal,"['Diplomatic frenzy and rattled nerves in republic as officials and former president reject US president’s comments', '', 'From a modern control room high above the canal expansion – overlooking the Cocolí locks, then lakes, rainforest canopy and, eventually, the Atlantic ocean – it barely registers that the era of gunboat diplomacy is returning to the Panama canal.', 'But four days into Donald Trump’s second administration, here we are. Trump has declared that he is “taking back” the Panama canal, sending TV crews from Washington to Beijing scrambling here to cover a crisis that has led to frenzied diplomatic efforts and elicited fears of a repeat of the 1989 US military invasion.', 'Never mind that there are no signs of the Chinese influence Trump claims dominates this waterway, and the canal’s administrators deny his accusations that they overcharge US ships. Panama may have the truth on its side – the question is whether that counts for much these days.', '“What I say is: come and see it,” said Ilya Espino de Marotta, the Panama canal’s deputy administrator, when asked in the control tower about Trump’s remarks. “It’s pretty obvious when you come to the canal. We’re a very transparent entity.”', 'US secretary of state Marco Rubio may do just that this week as he descends on Latin America for his first tour abroad. According to Espino de Marotta, he is already discussing a meeting with the canal’s leadership. “I understand he’s going to meet with the administrator of the canal, so hopefully this would be a good place to meet,” she told the Observer, adding that she couldn’t speak for Rubio’s official agenda. On visiting the canal, she said: “I hope they are.”', 'Rubio’s potential visit to the canal zone – which would come as part of a week-long swing through Central America that will also include Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic – has not been previously reported. The Observer has approached the state department for comment.', '“The canal is run by Panamanians 100%. We are an autonomous entity,” added Espino de Marotta, who began working for the canal in the shipyard in 1985, when it was still under US control, and rose to lead its ambitious expansion. “There is no Chinese management of the canal.”', 'Speaking with current and former officials in Panama, as well as analysts, activists and rights watchdogs, it’s clear this country of just 4.5 million people at the southernmost tip of Central America is holding its breath as it tries to figure out what Trump wants and how far he is willing to go to get it.', 'He has said he will not rule out military force to take the canal – or annexing Greenland. The Financial Times on Friday reported that he held a “fiery” phone call with the Danish prime minister over US claims on Greenland that, according to five European sources, went “very badly”. Denmark is now in “crisis mode”.', 'In Panama, a country with a dollarised economy and a recent familiarity with American imperialism, the muggy air is thick with risk management. Few expect a military campaign, but economic coercion is a real threat for this country.', 'Yet the claims that the canal is mismanaged have touched a nerve. Just days after Trump first issued his threats over the canal, three former leaders of the country convened with President José Raúl Mulino in a rare show of support in Panama’s fractured politics.', '“I know you know that some people don’t care about facts, but they’re there,” Martín Torrijos, the president of Panama from 2004-09 and the initiator of the expansion project, said in an interview with the Observer from his offices overlooking Panama Bay.', 'In 1977, his father, the strongman Gen Omar Torrijos, signed the two treaties with Jimmy Carter that would eventually cede control of the canal to Panama by 1999. Last month, Torrijos attended Carter’s funeral, where he said that old US opponents of the handover told him it had been the right decision all along.', '(At the time, it was extremely divisive. Ronald Reagan’s take was: “We built it, we paid for it, it’s ours.” Within a decade, the US would invade the country to overthrow the dictator Manuel Noriega.)', 'But the days when the US could overthrow a Panamanian government had passed, said Torrijos, and a military intervention against the canal, much less the country, was not realistic. “The times where the US had a military presence in Panama – that finished on 31 December at 12 noon, 1999,” said Torrijos, who was sitting in front of a portrait of his father painted by a Cuban artist. “They are not coming back.”', 'The last place Panama wanted to be was in Trump’s inauguration speech, which turned his earlier threats to take back the canal into a pledge for his second term in office.', '“I don’t believe that Panama has a strategy,” said Danilo Toro, a political analyst, saying that President Mulino should have done “everything possible to avoid being in that speech. It’s gonna be harder for Panama to deal with that now. If it doesn’t do something soon, it will get worse.”', 'But in the post-truth era of world politics, Panama’s protests may only go so far before it needs to cut a deal.And for that, Panama may need currency. Earlier last week, the comptroller began to audit the two ports at either end of the canal. Both are owned by a Hong Kong-based company that Rubio had claimed China could use to “turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict, and that is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States”.', 'Sceptics have argued that the audit could be a cover to take those ports away from their current owners. But current officials say the financial reviews were long-planned and were not politicised, a portrayal that watchdog groups carefully agreed with, saying a recent renewal of the government port had raised suspicions and appeared disadvantageous.', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'Other ports would be audited, the comptroller said, and whole industries such as the electric utilities were also undergoing checks.', '“This is not a witch hunt,” Anel Flores, the comptroller general of the Republic of Panama, who took office this month, said in an interview. “We want to find out what the real numbers are and if we’re getting really what we deserve.”', 'The audit could take 45 days, he estimated, refusing to speculate on its results. But he did confirm that the audit could produce grounds that could lead Panama to strip the concession from the China-headquartered companies.', 'That would be a bombshell, said Lina Vega Abad, head of the local chapter of Transparency International, and the government would need “very strong proof … because [the Chinese] are going to fight back”. It could also send a “dangerous message” for other investors, she said.', 'Still it could be one way to appease the US. “That might be the only strategy for the new government with Trump,” said Toro.', 'Trump was not necessarily unpopular in Panama City before he began making threats to renew a dormant conflict. There are superfans like Mayer Mizrachi, the elected mayor, who jets around town in a Cybertruck. His social media is littered with homages to Trump, Elon Musk and podcast host Joe Rogan, among others.', 'After Trump threatened to seize the canal, Mizrachi posted on X, saying that the country wanted dialogue but warning that it would “never be the 51st state”.', 'Still, Mizrachi tries to take a positive tack and says he is “concerned but not scared”. “I’m a very big fan of American democracy, capitalism, free speech, innovation, the pursuit of greatness,” he said.', '“I was excited when Trump won. I made it quite open, you know – I posted a picture and everything. And I think that’s my interpretation: finally, we have a president in the US who is interested in Panama. And I think that’s great.”', 'Across town in a small cafe, Paula Rodriguez recalls the night of the US invasion – 20 December 1989. It was the night her father died.', 'Lt Octavio Rodriguez was on duty when US Navy Seals stormed an aerodrome. According to some reports, they were targeting Noriega’s Learjet. Responding to the attack, Rodriguez and his troops ambushed the Seals.', 'Four US soldiers were killed, and Rodriguez was fatally wounded, one of hundreds of Panamanians killed that evening. Rodriguez was three years old at the time. But nearly every Panamanian in their 40s or older will have vivid memories of the night US troops landed in the city.', 'Toro, the political analyst, recalled seeing men shoot each other as he walked across the city to a friend’s in order to secure baby formula for his three-month-old child.', 'Rodriguez organises a music event each year that she has called Never Forget. “Panamanian people – we rise, you know, we defend and we unite, after all, to defend our country and our people. Because it’s not about the canal, it’s about our integrity,” Rodriguez said.', '“If you can see in the social media, people are angry, angry, and writing: ‘No way – this is not gonna happen again’.”']"

On Sunday, Trump said that he did not think troops would be necessary, but that Panama had violated the agreement and the United States would take back the canal.', '“China’s running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China, that was given to Panama - foolishly - but they violated the agreement, and we’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen,” Trump told reporters.', '“I don’t think troops will be necessary in Panama,” he added.', 'Rubio, a longtime China hawk during his Senate career, said last week on Sirius XM’s The Megyn Kelly Show that China could use the ports to shut down the canal, a vital route for U.S. shipping, in the event of a conflict between Beijing and Washington.', 'Mulino said his meeting with Rubio was respectful and cordial. He showed willingness to review some Chinese businesses in Panama, including a key 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings\n, renewed in 2021 for the operation of ports at both entrances of the canal, pending the results of an audit.', 'The contract has been targeted by U.S. lawmakers and the government as an example of China’s expansion in Panama, which they claim goes against a neutrality treaty signed by both countries in 1977.', 'Panama’s government and some experts reject that assertion, mainly because the ports are not part of the canal’s operations. The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.', 'A broad agreement between Panama and China to contribute to China’s Belt and Road initiative, under which the Asian country expanded investment in Panama during previous administrations, will not be renewed, Mulino said.', '“We’ll study the possibility of terminating it early,” he added.', '“I do not feel that there is any real threat at this time against the (neutrality) treaty, its validity, and much less the use of military force to make the treaty,” Mulino said, adding that it will be important to have face-to-face talks with Trump.', 'Rubio later visited the Miraflores Locks through which ships pass between the Pacific and the canal. Canal officials briefed Rubio as a Panamanian-flagged LPG carrier entered a lock from the canal to descend to the Pacific.', 'China has said it plays no part in operating the canal and that it respects Panama’s sovereignty and independence over the waterway.', '“Never ever has China interfered,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said when asked about the U.S. claims last month, adding that China recognizes the canal as “a permanently neutral international waterway.”', 'Rubio is touring Central America and the Caribbean on his first foray in the post as he seeks to refocus U.S. diplomacy on the Western Hemisphere - in part to recruit help in stemming migration toward the U.S. southern border.', 'The visit also reflects a U.S. desire to counter China’s growing economic and political influence in Latin America.', 'Mulino also announced that a memorandum of understanding signed in July with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could be expanded so Venezuelans, Colombians and Ecuadoreans can be returned from the perilous Darien Gap at U.S. cost, through an airstrip in Panama.', 'The Darien Gap connects Colombia with the Central American nation of Panama and increasing numbers of migrants were making the journey north to reach the United States.', 'Rubio has ordered the State Department to put migration issues at the center of its diplomacy with countries in the region.

It is a deeply unpopular proposition in Panama, seen as a “reversion to the mid-20th century imperial encroachment that Panama so intentionally confronted over the course of the Canal transition.” It is also, “on a logistical level,” essentially “impossible,” according to Panama City-based scholar Miriam Pensack. In what Pensack calls a “troubling” development, Panama has announced it will more closely cooperate with Trump’s policing of migration from Central America to the United States as a diplomatic concession to his threats.', 'AMY GOODMAN: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is traveling to Costa Rica and Guatemala City today before heading to the Dominican Republic as part of his first foreign trip in his new post. Rubio was just in Panama and El Salvador.', 'After meeting with Rubio on Monday, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in a statement his country would receive immigrants and asylum seekers of any nationality deported from the United States. He also offered to jail U.S. citizens who are convicted of crimes for a fee in El Salvador’s troubled maximum-security mega-prison complex. Bukele said the fee would be, quote, “low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable,” he said. Rubio spoke on Monday.', 'SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: He has agreed to accept for deportation any illegal alien in the United States who is a criminal, from any nationality, be they MS-13 or Tren de Aragua, and house them in his jails. And third, he has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those of U.S. citizenship and legal residence.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Secretary of State Rubio praised Salvadoran President Bukele, who’s been accused of gross human rights abuses and of violating Salvador’s constitution by remaining in power for a third presidential term. Bukele has been enforcing a state of emergency for nearly three years, leading to the detention of over 83,000 people without access to due process. Human rights groups estimate hundreds of people have died in Bukele’s prisons since March 2022.', 'This comes after far-right immigration hard-liner, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller said last week Bukele could become one of the strongest partners in the Central American region.', 'STEPHEN MILLER: The president, Bukele, has graciously offered tremendous degrees of cooperation with the United States on all things migration. And we’re hoping that will provide a framework for migration cooperation all throughout the region. And I think it’s very clear that President Bukele is going to be a very great and strong partner for this administration and for the United States.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Trump has long admired El Salvador’s prisons. The Trump administration is working with El Salvador on what is known as a safe third country agreement that would allow the U.S. to block migrants from requesting asylum in the U.S. and deport them to El Salvador, which would be designated a safe third country where they could seek asylum.', 'Rubio’s began his trip in Panama, though, as Trump reiterated his threat to retake the Panama Canal, claiming it’s being operated by China.', 'PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China is running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China. That was given to Panama, foolishly. But they’ve violated the agreement, and we’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen. … I don’t think troops will be necessary in Panama. What Panama has done is terrible for national security for this part of the world. And, you know, 70% of the signage on the Panama Canal was written in Chinese. That’s not right. It wasn’t meant for China.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Speaking to reporters, Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino said he may expand an existing agreement with the U.S. to begin direct deportations of non-Panamanian migrants who make the dangerous journey through the Darién Gap jungle along Panama’s southern border with Colombia.', 'PRESIDENT JOSÉ RAÚL MULINO: [translated] On the aspect of immigration, we agreed to explore the possibility of expanding the memorandum of understanding that we signed on July 1st along with United States Department of Homeland Security to better articulate the issue of repatriation from the Darién. Anything that is going to be done, I’ve offered the area of the Nicanor track, the Metetí, Darién, so that it is from where the process of repatriation of people from different parts, such as Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, among other nationalities, is supplied.', 'AMY GOODMAN: All of this comes as one country is not on Rubio’s itinerary, Cuba, which he was asked about on Fox News, as the State Department website now outlines a plan for, quote, “Restoring a Tough U.S.-Cuba Policy.”', 'SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: I have no intention of going to Havana with his regime in place, other than to discuss when they’re going to leave.', 'AMY GOODMAN: But Trump has announced plans to hold some 30,000 immigrants and asylum seekers in a mass detention camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba on the U.S. naval base there.', 'For more, we’re joined by two guests. Roman Gressier is a French American journalist based in Guatemala City, where he’s the editor of El Faro English and host of the podcast Central America in Minutes. And in Panama City, we’re joined by Miriam Pensack, postdoctoral fellow in the History Department at Princeton University, historian of modern Latin America.', 'We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Miriam, let’s begin with you. You’re in Panama City. Rubio was just there. He’s saying he’s taking Panama Canal back, essentially, from China. Can you talk about the threats and what the Panamanian president agreed to?', 'MIRIAM PENSACK: Hi, Amy. Thank you for having me.', 'Yes, so, Rubio was here. He arrived Saturday night. He had a two-hour meeting, one hour privately with Mulino and then another hour with his ministers. Afterwards, Mulino gave a press conference in which he essentially said, “Don’t worry. We won’t be invaded” — which the fact that that was one of the first things he had to say is, of course, a bit troubling, to say the least.', 'What Panama has agreed to, effectively, is to further collaborate on immigration, or, rather, deportation and repatriation for migrants moving through the Darién Gap. There has already been a pretty extensive degree of collaboration between the United States government and the Panamanian equivalent of the Border Patrol, which is called SENAFRONT. There’s an ICE office in the U.S. Embassy here in Panama City. So, that collaboration has been underway for a long time.', 'Something that Rubio did mention and Mulino agreed to is this use of this airstrip in the Darién, which has a certain degree of, I suppose, geographic utility insofar as Panama is this infrastructural hub for the Americas in general. On Monday, yesterday, Rubio oversaw a deportation flight leaving from the former U.S. base at Albrook in Panama City to repatriate — or, deport, rather, upwards of 40 Colombians who came from the United States.', 'So, that’s what we’ve seen so far. There’s still a lot of pressure in terms of undoing the relationship with China that Panama has forged since it took up formal diplomatic relations with Beijing in 2017.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Miriam, could you talk to us more about the current president of Panama, Mulino? Because there were mass protests not only to Rubio’s visit, but against Mulino’s administration, as well. How is he seen among the Panamanian people in terms of his connection or relations to the U.S.?', 'MIRIAM PENSACK: Sure. So, Panama, in general, it should be stated — and Rubio mentioned this — Panama is, you know, extremely friendly to the United States and to U.S. interests. It’s very pro-business. There’s really no meaningful articulation of the left in terms of electoral politics here.', 'Something that has happened with Mulino’s government, you know, he’s amidst a reform of the Social Security and pension system here, which will be unpopular. So these threats from the United States have, I think, to a certain degree, united the country behind him, which he can probably use to push through legislation and pension reforms and things of that nature.', 'Now, that being said, sovereignty has long been, understandably, because of the former Panama Canal Zone here that was operated exclusively by the United States for the majority of the 20th century — Panama has long been concerned with the question of sovereignty. So, kowtowing to the United States on these issues is not popular, shall we say? Some of the protests that you saw, the burning of American flags, posters of Rubio with swastikas over his face, things like that, most of that is carried out by a syndicalist group, a sort of union conglomerate, if you will, called SUNTRACS. They shut down the city, many streets on Friday. They protested in front of the U.S. Embassy. And there is just this notion that this is a reversion to the sort of mid-20th century imperial encroachment that Panama so intentionally confronted over the course of the canal transition in the last two decades of the 20th century.', 'JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And this whole issue of Chinese alleged control of the canal, the reality is, Panama became the first country in Latin America to sign on to the Belt and Road Initiative of infrastructure projects of China, but there are now 22 countries in Latin America who are part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The importance of Mulino saying that they’re going to review and possibly withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative? And how expensive is Chinese investment in Panama, given the fact that the United States has largely ignored major investments in much of the region?', 'MIRIAM PENSACK: Sure. So, yes, the question of China. In 2017, under the government of Juan Carlos Varela, Panama did what a lot of the region has done in recent years, which is to cut ties with Taiwan and to formalize relations with Beijing, at which point there was certainly an uptick and entrance into this Belt and Roads Initiative that you mentioned, so an uptick in Chinese investment, a sort of movement towards greater trade with China.', 'Something that bears mentioning is that following the election of Donald Trump, the U.S. ambassador, then-ambassador, departed not long after. And in fact, the Trump administration and the State Department appointed no ambassador to Panama for, effectively, the entirety of the first Trump administration. So, this really left — as Mulino said in his speech, his press conference following his meeting with Rubio, this left a lot of empty chairs, into which China slid.', 'So, this Belt and Roads Initiative, Mulino said that he will not renew the agreement. That was one of the concessions that he offered Rubio and the United States. He also sort of got ahead of things. This happened in early January. So, maybe after the first or second time that Trump mentioned that he was going to, quote, “retake the Panama Canal,” he began auditing the — Mulino, excuse me — Mulino began auditing the Hong Kong-based company that won concession bids to operate these two ports on the Atlantic and Pacific side of the canal. So, that audit was, I think, a sort of preemptive attempt to hopefully find — you know, hopefully for the Panamanian government, it would be a fortuitous out to their current predicament — to hopefully find some degree of wrongdoing in the bookkeeping, something to that effect, so that there would be a reason to annul the contracts and potentially open up bids to U.S. companies to take control of those ports.', 'AMY GOODMAN: Miriam Pensack, very quickly, what would it take for the U.S. to, quote, “take back” — what Trump keeps threatening — take back the Panama Canal?', 'MIRIAM PENSACK: On a logistical level, it’s impossible, because the entity that runs the Panama Canal, an autonomous — effectively, a state within a state of Panama, the Panama Canal Authority, operates the lock system and the pilot system, which moves — you know, it sort of leads these large container ships through the canal. It’s run by roughly 8,800 Panamanian employees. So, the notion that the United States could take over that — you know, the transition to have Panama take over that operation required 23 years of collaboration between the two governments. So the notion that that can be done overnight with something like, say, an executive order, or something to that effect, on a logistical level, is quite impossible.']"

His first stop, Panama could prove to be the most contentious on the itinerary following President Donald Trump’s repeated demands for control of the Panama Canal.', '“Panamanian sovereignty over the canal is clear. There is no discussion on this issue. The soul of a country is not up for discussion,” Panama President José Raúl Mulino emphasized on Thursday, just days ahead of his scheduled meeting with Rubio.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nTrump’s ambition to retake the Panama Canal could have a heavy cost', 'Yet the Trump administration doesn’t seem to be letting this go. In his inauguration speech, Trump mentioned Panama six times, more than any other foreign country. He and Republican allies are increasingly painting a dark scenario where the Panama Canal has secretly fallen under Chinese military control – arguing that’s why the US needs to seize the canal back from Beijing’s clutches.', '“A foreign power today possesses, through their companies, which we know are not independent, the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict,” Rubio himself insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings this month.', '“That is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States,” he added.', 'As ominous as it all sounds, the reality is not so straight forward. Here is a fact check about claims Trump’s administration has made about the Panama Canal.', 'Trump has long complained about the “bad deal” Jimmy Carter made when he returned the canal to Panama in 1977. But he’s been ratcheting up the rhetoric and falsehoods from the very start of his second term.', '“Panama’s promise to us has been broken,” Trump said during his inaugural speech. “Above all China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we are taking it back!”', 'On his Truth Social network, Trump has also claimed – without proof – that Chinese soldiers have been deployed to the canal and that “Panama is, with great speed attempting to take down the 64% of signs which are written in Chinese. They are all over the Zone.”', 'But the “Zone” – a former American enclave bordering the canal – hasn’t existed since 1979.', 'And if the scenario Trump describes sounds like the plot of a movie, well, it was. In the 2001 movie “The Tailor of Panama,” which starred Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush, the US invades Panama after receiving bogus intelligence that China is trying to secretly buy the canal.', 'In reality, since 2000 the canal has been operated by the Panama Canal Authority, whose administrator, deputy administrator and 11-member board are selected by Panama’s government but operate independently.', 'The majority of the canal’s employees are Panamanians and Panama designates which companies are awarded the contracts to run the ports near the canal. Ships transiting the 50-mile-long canal are required to be piloted by local captains that work for the Canal Authority.', 'While there is real concern about increased Chinese investment in Latin America, Panama included, to date there is no evidence of Chinese military activity in Panama. At his press conference on Thursday, Mulino said the US government has yet to provide his administration with any proof they had gathered of Chinese control of the canal.', 'The Trump administration seems to be pointing to the fact that Panama Ports – part of a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings – operates terminals on the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the canal.

That same year, control of Hong Kong – where Hutchinson is based – was transferred from the United Kingdom to China.', 'While falling under Beijing’s sphere of influence, Hutchison is hardly some murky Chinese military front company. It’s publicly traded, not known to be on any US blacklists and their subsidiary Hutchinson Ports is one of the world’s largest port operators, overseeing 53 ports in 24 countries, including for other US allies such as the UK, Australia and Canada.', 'Crucially, Hutchison does not control access to the Panama Canal. Workers at their two ports only load and unload containers onto ships and supply them with fuel. And they’re not the only ones – three other ports in the vicinity of the canal are operated by competing companies providing similar services.', 'Since Trump’s comments, Panama’s government has announced an audit of the Hutchison-owned Panama Ports. The company says it is complying fully and has even invited Rubio to visit its ports.', '“An invitation has been extended to the Secretary of State to visit our terminal facilities in Panama during his scheduled trip to the country,” Hutchison Ports spokesperson Anthony Tam said in an email to CNN.', 'The State Department would not comment if Rubio planned to accept the invitation to visit what the Trump administration has described – incorrectly — as a de facto Chinese military outpost in Panama.', 'Under the 1977 treaty with Panama, the US returned the canal with the understanding that the waterway remain neutral.', 'According to the agreement, the US could intervene militarily if the canal’s operations were disrupted by internal conflict or a foreign power. This seems to be what Trump is referencing when he threatens to “take the canal back.”', 'But it would be hard to argue that the waterway’s operations are disrupted or endangered. Following the expansion of the canal, which began in 2007 and Panama financed at a cost of more than $5 billion, more cargo than ever runs through the canal than it did during the years of US administration.', 'A US occupation of the canal would fly in the face of international law and the treaty the US agreed to.', 'Since the 1989 US invasion that deposed dictator Manuel Noriega, Panama does not have an army but Panamanians are fiercely protective of the canal which is central to their national identity.

At least 25,000 US citizens live in Panama who would likely be placed in harm’s way by any US military action to seize the canal. Disruption of the canal’s operations would likely send prices of US goods from automobiles to sneakers soaring – about 40% of US container traffic passes through the waterway.', 'And of course, backing out of a decades-old deal and trying to wrest the canal back by force from an ally would be a propaganda goldmine for Russia and China which have both called for maintaining neutrality in the canal.', 'Any US military action would also further inflame tensions in Latin America where mass deportations have already tested Washington’s partnerships in the region.', 'Trump’s dream of flying a US flag over the Panama Canal would come at a much higher cost than he appears to have calculated.', '© 2025 Cable News Network.

Rubio is scheduled to visit El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic.', 'His trip comes as President Trump has triggered two major diplomatic spats in the region. First suggesting the United States should retake the Panama canal and then by launching a brief trade war with Colombia over immigration.', ""Here are three things to know about Secretary Rubio's first foreign trip"", 'It is rare for an American secretary of state to begin their travels by going to Latin America. Back in 2001, Colin Powell, opened his tenure by traveling to Mexico to accompany President George W. Bush for a meeting with the Mexican president. It was a one day trip and Powell quickly moved on to the Middle East.', ""To find a secretary of state who began their term with a whirlwind tour of Latin America like Rubio is doing, you'd have to look back a century when in 1912, Philander Chase Knox traveled to Panama and then spent a month crisscrossing Latin America — from Nicaragua to Venezuela."", '""This is a really interesting moment for US relations with Latin America,"" said Benjamin Gedan, of the Wilson Center previewing Rubio\'s trip.

Rubio said in case of conflict, Chinese companies could have the ""ability to turn the canal into a choke point.""', ""Leland Lazarus, who studies China's role in Latin America at Florida International University, says Rubio will have his work cut out, because for some Latin American countries China has become a major trading partner. Indeed, China is now the No. 1 trading partner for South America."", '""I think he\'s got to provide actual alternatives and not just tell countries China is bad,"" Lazarus told NPR. ""You can\'t do business with China because that is just not feasible for many countries in the region.""', 'Rubio is the first Latino secretary of state.

Now that his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has just demanded “immediate changes” at the canal, no one is laughing anymore—at least no one should be.', 'The ostensible source of Trump’s concern is that, as he said in his address, “China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China.” It’s true that a Hong Kong–based company operates ports on both the Atlantic and the Pacific ends of the waterway. This gives China a foothold that the authors of the treaty ceding the canal to Panama never contemplated. But it is not the same as “operating” the canal; the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency, does that.', 'Whether the Hong Kong company’s position creates leverage China could use against the U.S. is nevertheless a matter of debate. What’s not debatable is Trump’s belief that it could. As he repeated after Rubio’s visit, “We’re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen.”', 'Panama seems impressed. It has already agreed to exit China’s Belt and Road infrastructure funding initiative. Also clear is that this geopolitical fight doubles as a bold domestic political move—Trump is tapping “something very powerful” within the collective psyche of the American right.', 'Consciously or not, he is staging a remake of the political drama that unfolded five decades ago, in which then-outsider Ronald Reagan turned opposition to U.S. transfer of sovereignty over the Panama Canal into rocket fuel for his 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns. And then, as now, the canal issue served as a two-edged sword with which a newly assertive right, headed by an anti-Washington outsider, could smite both weak-kneed liberals and the GOP establishment.', 'It’s impossible to grasp what Trump is doing now without understanding what Reagan did in the 1970s.', 'It’s hard to overstate the role that the Panama Canal once played in the American imagination. For generations after the U.S. completed the project in 1914, American schoolchildren learned that the canal was the “eighth wonder of the world,” an engineering marvel that other nations had tried and failed to achieve, and thus epitomized U.S. ingenuity, determination, and sacrifice. Costing $375 million (roughly $10 billion today), the canal was the most expensive construction project in American history. Nearly 6,000 people, mostly workers from Barbados but also 300 Americans, lost their lives building it. It was all worth it, kids were taught—and adults believed—because by linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, it embodied America’s rightful rise to global preeminence.', 'Yet American pride had a counterpart in Latin American resentment over what nationalists in the region depicted as an imperial gash through an independent country. Riots outside the Canal Zone became a regular occurrence during the twentieth century. Fearing negative repercussions for the Cold War, and feeling pangs of imperial guilt, Republicans and Democrats began to believe it would be wiser to salve Latin America’s wounded feelings than to insist on America’s prerogatives.', 'Democratic president Lyndon Johnson opened negotiations to cede American sovereignty over the canal to Panama—while maintaining the right to defend it in case of attack. This was a strategy his Republican successors, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, continued. In June 1975, two months after the fall of Saigon, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned Ford of a “Vietnam-type situation” in Latin America if negotiations over the canal did not advance.', 'When Reagan announced his long shot challenge to Ford for the Republican presidential nomination in November, he didn’t mention the Panama Canal. By March 1976, however, after he had lost five primaries in a row, his campaign had gone broke, and his wife Nancy had begun to urge him to drop out, Reagan noticed that his stump speech line about the canal always seemed to trigger loud applause: “We bought it. We built it. It’s ours!”', 'In a country reeling from its humiliating defeat in Vietnam, Reagan’s appeal to a glorious past in Panama struck a chord. He went on to win the North Carolina primary, swept all 96 delegates in Texas, and over the course of three days, won contests in Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana.', 'By May of 1976, Reagan actually led the delegate count. Though he eventually lost narrowly to Ford at the GOP convention that summer, he emerged as the party’s undisputed star after Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in November. Had Reagan not tapped the anger many Americans felt over the Panama Canal “giveaway,” had he not expressed his outrage at the indignity of America being made to grovel before a country like Panama, it’s likely that his political career would have ended before the convention.', 'As president, Carter pursued the Panama Canal Treaties that handed both the waterway and a 10-mile–wide U.S.-controlled zone around it to Panama, albeit gradually over a period of years. Conservative GOP activists, however, learning from the 1976 Reagan campaign, made opposition to the treaties a centerpiece of the midterm elections in 1978—the year the Senate ratified them. And they did so again in 1980, when Reagan won the White House and Republicans retook the upper chamber for the first time since 1955.', '“In each of the targeted campaigns. . . when we ask, ‘What is the major failing?’ the Panama Canal comes up as either number one or two,” Terry Dolan, one of the period’s most important conservative activists, told a newspaper in Idaho, where the issue helped GOP challenger Steve Symms beat liberal Democratic stalwart Frank Church. According to New York Times political reporter Adam Clymer, “at least five” of the dozen Democratic senators who lost their seats that year were defeated in part due to their support for the canal treaties.', 'Trump’s threat to grab the canal back eerily resembles Reagan’s opposition to “giving it away.” In both cases, media and foreign policy elites failed to comprehend the political saliency of an issue they considered fringy and obscure.', '“The cognoscenti in Washington had just the opposite view,” Reagan aide Peter Hannaford recalled of his former boss’s canal crusade, “that anybody who’s against this is a troglodyte.” Those words could have been written about Trump and his supporters today.', 'Like the Trump movement generally, the right’s opposition to the canal treaties was a grassroots, populist, anti-establishment cause. “Our strength is not in Washington,” conservative direct-mail activist Richard Viguerie, who raised millions of dollars off the canal issue, boasted in 1977. “Our strength is in Peoria and Oshkosh and White River Falls.” One movement leader said that the canal debate was “an excellent opportunity to seize control of the Republican Party,” with every senator’s position on the treaties a litmus test for ideological purity.', 'The strongest parallel between Trump and Reagan’s approach to the Panama Canal, however, is that both framed the issue as a matter of national renewal in the face of decline, symbolized by loss of control over the waterway. Ever since the canal’s construction, the debate over its ownership has never been exclusively about the canal’s practical uses, but also about the nature of America’s role in the world. To both Reagan and Trump, America is too great to let pissant little countries order it around.', 'Also a factor in their thinking: the need to send a signal of strength to distant great powers, the Soviet Union for Reagan, and in Trump’s case, China, which he sees as having been granted special privileges by the waterway’s Panamanian operators.', 'The overriding theme of Trump’s 2016 candidacy was anger over America being “ripped off” by other countries. Forty years prior, lamenting the proposed concessions to a military regime led by left-leaning General Omar Torrijos, Reagan declared America “should tell Panama’s tinhorn dictator just what he can do with his demands for sovereignty over the Canal Zone.” It was a PG-13 version of the way Trump expresses his contempt for selected foreign leaders.', 'The pursuit of dominance over the Panama Canal is a classic example of what Walter Russell Mead terms the Jacksonian school of American foreign policy thought, an ideological blend of unapologetic nationalism, suspicion of elites, skepticism of the liberal world order, and disdain for global opinion. The reputational damage that continued American control over the canal would inflict—according to foreign policy experts—didn’t bother Reagan, nor has a much fiercer international outcry inhibited Trump from refusing to rule out military action to recover it.', 'Donald Trump may not know the history of how the Panama Canal issue powered the rise of the modern conservative movement. But he instinctively grasps, better than anyone, the emotions it stirs within the American psyche—and how to turn it into political energy.', 'Watch Reagan debate William F. Buckley Jr. on the Panama Canal Treaties here:']"

What Trump Really Wants in Panama,https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/what-trump-really-wants-in-panama/,"['', 'PANAMA CITY — Ever since President Donald Trump first aired his grievances about the Panama Canal in December, the establishment here and indeed throughout the Americas has been engaged in the same guessing game: “What does he really want?”', 'At first, the question was met with a certain knowing wink: This is what Trump does, opening a negotiation by pounding the table. But after the president of the United States explicitly said in his inauguration speech on Jan. 20 that he wants the canal back, opening the door to a new era of American expansionism that also includes Greenland, calm has been replaced in Panama by a mix of urgency, gallows humor and utter disbelief.', 'After spending several days in Panama City (a long-planned visit, though no one believed me) and meeting with local business and political leaders, four main theories emerged about Trump’s true endgame.', 'The first and most widely cited thesis revolves around 1) China — and here, many in Panama say Trump has a point.', 'No, there are no Chinese troops in the Panama Canal, as Trump has claimed, nor any Chinese presence within the canal itself. But China arguably controls the biggest ports on either end of the canal via a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings. Hutchison’s unit has administered the ports without incident since 1997, but the geopolitical equation changed after Hong Kong lost any pretense of autonomy in recent years. General Laura Richardson, until recently the head of the U.S. military’s Southern Command, repeatedly warned that China could repurpose the ports for military use or otherwise use them to disrupt canal traffic in the event of a conflict.', 'Some Panamanians downplay this risk. Other observers may dismiss it as yet another American delirium rooted in the 202-year-old Monroe Doctrine. But the Panama Canal receives about 40% of U.S. seaborne container traffic and 5% of global trade overall; any disruption would also cripple the U.S. Navy’s ability to move resources around the world. The idea that the canal is uniquely sensitive to U.S. national security, truly in a category of its own in Latin America, has been a core principle in Washington since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. Views of what is considered tolerable in terms of China’s presence have evolved in both Republican and Democratic policy circles, especially as Beijing has positioned itself near other global “chokepoints.” Trump and his team now appear to be using whatever leverage they have to shift that red line as they prepare for greater commercial, and possibly other, conflict with Beijing in years to come.', 'Trump’s tactics alienate people, and they may well erode U.S. alliances and, therefore interests, over time. However, the Panamanian government now appears to be dialing back a broad expansion of ties with Beijing that dates back to 2017, when then-President Juan Carlos Varela switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. Ensuing years saw Panama join China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative; host a visit by Xi Jinping; acquire Chinese “safe city” technology; and even authorize the construction of a new Chinese embassy near the entrance to the canal, before canceling the plan under U.S. and domestic pressure.', 'Since Trump’s election, President José Raúl Mulino’s government has announced an audit of the Hutchison port concession, which some locals say was extended under less than transparent circumstances in 2021. Mulino has also hired AECOM, a U.S. company, to oversee a planned $4 billion intercity train that previously attracted Chinese interest. “You’re a company recognized globally, a 100% American company,” Mulino said at a ceremony Monday, adding with a smile: “I hope no Chinese show up over there.”', 'Several business leaders I spoke to said that in retrospect such a deep embrace of Beijing was bound to cause trouble. “We are paying the price for 25 years of a lack of strategic thinking,” Alonso Illueca, a Panamanian lawyer who has written extensively on Chinese ties, told me. “That may now be changing.”\n\nThe second explanation for Trump’s threats revolves around 2) migration, and here, the outlook is mixed. Mulino made stopping migration through the Darien Gap a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, even before Trump was elected. He has referred to Panama as the U.S.’s “other border” and seems eager to work with Washington to toughen enforcement further. But if Trump wants Panama to receive immigrants from third countries like Venezuela, as some U.S. officials have suggested, he will face resistance. Bad memories remain from a similar arrangement in the 1990s, when Panama temporarily sheltered thousands of Cuban refugees, and riots broke out. The country has already absorbed large numbers of immigrants in recent years. “It’s politically impossible,” for Mulino, one observer said. “It could crash the government.”', 'The third theory centers on 3) transit fees through the canal. Local officials dispute Trump’s claim that U.S. Navy and other ships are paying higher fees than anyone else. They say an increase in fees in 2024 resulted instead from a historic drought that forced the canal to reduce traffic, putting reservations at a premium. Panama is barred by treaty from giving preferential rates to any specific country. However, some believe that authorities could waive fees for U.S. Navy vessels on security grounds as a gesture to Trump.', 'The final and most problematic possible explanation is that 4) Trump really does want the canal back.', 'Everyone in Panama noticed that Trump used his inaugural speech, rather than just another appearance on Fox and Friends, to declare his intentions for the canal. While some saw it as a classic Trump tactic, a maximalist position to open a negotiation, others note he preceded his remarks about Panama by extolling former U.S. President William McKinley, who oversaw the last period of major American territorial expansion in the 1890s. Trump may believe that Making America Great Again implies a return to those ambitions, just as it involves getting to Mars with the help of Elon Musk. Trump may also see this as the best path to a superlative legacy — and perhaps to having a mountain named after himself, as McKinley (once again) does.', 'Mulino has steadfastly rejected Trump’s advances, repeating Wednesday that the canal “is and always will be Panamanian.” On that point, he has overwhelming domestic support: Omar Torrijos, who signed the 1977 handover treaty, famously called the canal “the religion that unites all Panamanians.” But locals still worry that Washington could put enormous pressure on Panama without deploying a single U.S. troop. Panama is a dollarized economy and a major financial center, making it especially vulnerable to tariffs and Treasury Department sanctions like the ones Trump threatened against Colombia’s government this week. “He just showed us his arsenal,” one Panamanian executive noted.', '', 'Locals also darkly wonder if there is a personal element to Trump’s actions. Panama was the site of one of his company’s most ill-fated recent ventures, a hotel that local police entered and confiscated in 2018 following a dispute with another investor. His complaints about the canal handover go back at least a decade. “Trump knows Panama well,” Rodrigo Noriega, a political analyst, told me. “He knows how things work here. He knows where the pressure points are for the local elites.”', 'Whether Trump is motivated by one or two of these reasons or a combination of all four, Panama faces an uncertain and dangerous road. Ahead of a visit by Secretary of State Marco Rubio scheduled for this weekend, local officials have moved to correct the factual record, hired lobbyists in D.C., filed a complaint with the United Nations, and called on allies in Washington and around the world to help support their cause. Ultimately, the prevailing view inside Panama is still that if they can sufficiently address concerns 1, 2 and 3, they will be able to avoid 4.', 'Considering Panama’s demonstrated willingness to act, I personally find it hard to imagine that Trump, even at the apex of his power, would be able to go too far down the path of forced confiscation without facing resistance from elsewhere in the Republican Party, and perhaps among some of his Cabinet and military advisers. One can envision Trump eventually declaring that he did “take the canal back” — from China — in the same way he has claimed Mexico ended up paying for the border wall.', 'But in a world that is changing by the hour, and where the president of the United States thinks not in terms of allies or norms but in terms of strength and weakness, what happens next is truly anybody’s guess. Which is probably just how Donald Trump wants it.', '', 'Winter is the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and a seasoned analyst of Latin American politics, with more than 20 years following the region’s ups and downs.', '', 'Latin America faces numerous challenges in 2025, including Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

Ted Cruz opened the hearing by warning of increasing Chinese control of the canal—in his view, a violation of the United States’ 1977 agreement with Panama that returned control of the canal to the Central American nation at the end of 1999, as well as an economic and national security risk.', 'The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

Many of China’s manmade islands in the South China Sea began as ostensibly civilian projects before being militarized.”', 'Kontorovich also contended that the treaty between then-President Jimmy Carter and Panama provided both sides the ability to use military force to defend their interests in the canal.', '“It was clear that the treaty was understood as giving both sides separately the right to resort to use armed force to enforce the provisions of the treaty … Panama agreed that the United States could enforce this regime of neutrality by force,” he said.', 'Daniel Maffei, the chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, also told the committee that foreign actors shutting off American access to the Panama Canal is possible, although he suggested he had no reason to believe Chinese spies were working to do so.', '“It’s not hard to close off a waterway,” said Maffei. “The Panama Canal is actually quite vulnerable in terms of infrastructure.
