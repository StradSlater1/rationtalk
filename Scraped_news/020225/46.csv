"Karla Sofía Gascón Trainwrecks Her ‘Emilia Pérez’ Oscar Campaign: Does She Bring the Movie Down, Too?",https://www.indiewire.com/features/podcast/karla-sofia-gascon-emilia-perez-screen-talk-1235090467/,"['', 'Many Oscar contenders have been dive-bombed over the years, but Best Actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón did herself in: first for complaining about rival Fernanda Torres, then for resurfaced tweets on her now-deleted X account (@karsiagascon). In past posts that went viral this week, she dissed Muslims, George Floyd, and Oscars diversity, among other things. We debate: If Gascón is out of the running, does she bring down her movie as well, which leads the field with 13 nominations?', 'Ryan Lattanzio is back from Sundance, which Friday announced its awards; he and Anne are both bingeing on the Sundance portal. While some films came in with distribution, the market seems slow. One Midnight entry spawned a bidding war won by Neon for over $16 million, Michael Shanks’ horror flick “Together,” starring husband-and-wife team Alison Brie and Dave Franco, which Ryan enjoyed and believes will hit big at the box office. Neon has reason to bid high for horror, having grossed $169 million from three low-budget wide releases: “Longlegs,” “Immaculate,” and “Cuckoo.”', '', 'A second big buy was Clint Bentley’s magic-hour period drama “Train Dreams” (which went to Netflix), adapted from Denis Johnson’s novella, starring an Oscar-worthy Joel Edgerton as a logger forced to spend months away from his beloved wife, Felicity Jones. Ryan also liked “Rebuilding,” starring Josh O’Connor, which also features a destructive fire, and “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” starring Rose Byrne as a stressed-out mom. “A horror movie of motherhood,” he said.', 'The highest profile sales title was Bill Condon’s expensive Kander and Ebb musical adaptation of Manuel Puig’s novel “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” The film stars Diego Luna and breakout star Tonatiuh as prisoners sharing a cell in 1983 Argentina, with Jennifer Lopez leading the musical fantasy sequences as a fictional screen siren. Héctor Babenco’s 1985 Oscar-winning original cost $1.5 million. (The new movie’s reps say this one’s budget is far below $50 million.) Condon’s song-and-dance take could be a tough sell. We wonder if it’s too old-fashioned to land with today’s audiences.', 'One reason for late-breaking buys could be due to fewer screening venues, requiring Sundance to spread the program out over more days. Some buzzy titles like “Sorry, Baby” debuted after the first weekend.', '', 'To that end, we both adored “Train Dreams” and U.S. Dramatic Competition Screenwriting winner “Sorry, Baby,” marking an auspicious debut for writer/director/actor Eva Victor, who has made a comedy splash on TikTok.  Naomi Ackie costars in this well-observed academic drama about the repercussions of a “bad thing.”', 'Anne also focused on the documentaries, because Sundance always delivers three or four Oscar contenders at year’s end. Sundance 2024 premieres now up for Oscars include “Black Box Diaries,” “Sugarcane,” “Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat,” and “Porcelain War.” We both admired “The Jinx” director Andrew Jarecki’s shocking prison expose “The Alabama Solution,” which incorporates inmates’ own phone videos to detail terrible conditions within the state’s correctional facilities; “Perfect Neighbor,” which edited police tapes into a powerful narrative about a Florida manslaughter; and “Folktales,” Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s heartwarming story of a program that teaches young people dogsledding in the Arctic. Anne liked “Prime Minister,” about New Zealand’s COVID-fighter Jacinda Ardern. “Perfect Neighbor” and “Prime Minister” both won Sundance prizes Friday.', 'In other Sundance-related news, Quentin Tarantino gave a festival talk where he explained setting aside his supposed final film, “The Movie Critic,” and how he likely won’t tackle a new film anytime soon, partly because the movie business, he said, died in 2019. He’s going to try theater, where the audience is in the palm of the writer’s hand. Then, if it’s a hit, he might make that into a movie. “He is under so much pressure about that tenth film,” Anne said. “He sees that the old universe that used to guarantee that a certain kind of movie would do well no longer exists. He doesn’t want to go out on his last film a failure.”', '', 'Is the movie business dead? “It was a muted Sundance,” Ryan said. “We can’t take the temperature of that broader question by Sundance alone… but so many movies are going to languish and die here.”', 'Listen to the episode below or watch in the video above.', '', '', '', '', '']"

A new report from The Hollywood Reporter suggests that Netflix is growing weary of Karla and isn't feeling particularly inclined to pay for Karla to attend the Oscars ceremony, meaning they could essentially cut Karla out of any official Oscar campaigning."", ""To make sense of what's going on, here's everything you need to know about the Karla Sofía Gáscon controversy and what it means for Emilia Pérez's Oscar chances."", 'Karla first found herself in hot water in the last week of January. First, there were the statements she made about the Best Actress Oscar race, in which she seemed to accuse social media teams working with fellow-nominee Fernanda Torres of ""trying to diminish"" her work and that of the Emilia Pérez crew.', '""What I don\'t like are social media teams—people who work with these people—trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn\'t lead anywhere,"" she said in a Spanish-language interview, as reported by Variety. ""I have never at any point said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.""', 'Karla quickly walked back these accusations after fans pointed out that such comments could go against Academy rules, which prevent nominees from sharing ""misleading or false information about a motion picture, performance, or achievement"" and state that one cannot ""discourage members to vote for any motion picture, performance, or achievement.""', 'In a statement to Variety, Karla claimed that she was not speaking about anyone ""directly associated"" with Torres or her film, I\'m Still Here, adding, ""I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience."" Her statement, coupled with the fact that she didn\'t say anything negative about Torres\' performance or nomination, were enough to put this controversy to bed—for a few hours. Then the tweets started coming out...', ""Karla might not have broke any Oscar rules, but she upset fans enough that they started digging through her X, formerly Twitter, account. And what they found was much more damning. As first resurfaced by journalist Sarah Hagi, Karla's account was reportedly full of offensive, racist, and Islamophobic tweets."", 'Among her reported statements (which were translated from Spanish), one called George Floyd ""a drug addict swindler.""

Gascón received death threats. She also lashed back on social media at what she has called “a campaign of hate and misinformation”, and has blamed the publicists behind some of this year’s rival films (especially the Brazilian drama I’m Still Here) for stoking the flames.', 'Until last week, it was possible to sympathise with Gascón up to a point. But there’s no defending her now-infamous tweets. A Canada-based culture writer called Sarah Hagi was the one who found them – motivated, as a Muslim woman, by a dog-whistle use of the word “Islamist” in one of Gascón’s recent posts.', 'What Hagi found, doing a basic search on Gascón’s Twitter feed for words such as “Muslims” or “hijab” in Spanish, was a torrent of vileness, posted between 2016 and 2023 with almost no one paying attention.

The journalist firmly believes that Gascón’s “blatant racism” ought to result in the rescinding of her Oscar nomination. There’s certainly no way she will win, which might have been an outside possibility until this happened.', 'How Gascón – and by extension, Emilia Pérez generally – even got this far in this awards race is the question that has everyone confounded. Before being cast by Jacques Audiard in this role, the Madrid-born actress was really only known to Mexican audiences, for a string of telenovelas in which she appeared, pre-transitioning, as a man, credited as “Juan Carlos Gascón” or sometimes “Carlos Gascón”.', 'Gascón’s most prolific part, a supporting role for 80 episodes, was in a period drama called Wild Heart (2009-2010). These weren’t star turns – Gascón was featured among ensembles of dozens. (Consider that Gascón’s second most prominent role, in the cartel drama The Lord of the Skies, totted up to 47 episodes. Lead actor Rafael Amaya has now done 700.) Post-transitioning in 2018, Gascón made a small handful of other appearances as “Karla Sofia”.', 'Had she achieved international fame sooner, it’s surely probable that some kind of broader fan base would have existed, and more people would have looked askance at some of the incriminating tweets. Perhaps, with management guidance, she would have been more circumspect about casually venting. Indeed, the only way this current situation arises is because Gascón wasn’t a celebrity, in any real sense, before Emilia Pérez. She was a TV actor, thoroughly unknown outside the Spanish-speaking world.', 'As a PR disaster, this is up there with one of the most brutal to afflict an Oscar race in many years – much worse than Charlotte Rampling saying that the 2016 diversity row was “racist to white people”. It’s practically the Will Smith slap, if he had delivered it in tweet form to a range of minorities, and managed to time it before, and not after, the voting was done.', 'While Gascón’s tweets themselves are unconscionable, the disaster was entirely preventable, and this is what’s most bizarre. Netflix, who bought the film for $12 million following its success at Cannes, are entirely responsible for elevating Emilia Pérez to Oscar heavyweight status – indeed, with 13 nominations, it holds the record for the biggest tally a foreign-language film has ever received. To get that far – and with such an odd duck of a film to work with – requires the orchestration of an immensely intricate, concerted and expensive awards campaign. There’s a rumour floating around that 200 people are deployed by Netflix to concentrate on awards-season publicity alone.', 'With all of those resources, it beggars belief that no one on their team thought Gascón’s social media history might come under scrutiny, or had a cursory scroll backwards to make sure nothing was beyond the pale. If the most basic due diligence had been performed, she could have taken the precaution of deactivating her account – which she has now done, of course – and we’d be none the wiser about her written record of Islamophobia (and everything else).', 'Even before the tweets resurfaced, Gascón’s presence on socials was vehement, to say the least. She was mightily defensive about her Mexican accent, and went on the attack against the campaign for I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres, her Best Actress rival, accusing that team of trying to discredit her.', 'It’s perhaps not surprising, then, that her response to the crisis has been chaotic and packed with denials, to the point where it has only made things worse. She arranged an hour-long interview with CNN en Español, supposedly without even telling Netflix, and continued to beat the drum tearfully, and unapologetically, about her remarks being taken out of context, and in some cases fabricated.', 'Did she really call her Emilia co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat”, in a since-deleted tweet from October 2022? She says that tweet was “not mine”. Equally, she says that an apparent defence of Hitler, for “simply having opinions about Jews”, was misunderstood.', 'Gascón’s very obscurity up to this point has been her calamitous undoing. She has leapt to notoriety in one bound, and the scandal has depressingly tarnished any coup for trans representation that her nomination, or her film, can ever claim in the future.', 'Hagi believes she should be disqualified, not just because of the tweets themselves, but because “she hasn’t explicitly apologised to the group she offended”. For her part, Gascón has said she will not withdraw from contention, which leaves the Academy mulling over this stain on the Best Actress category, with a month left to go. Netflix has now removed Gascón’s name from its Oscar ads, and seems to have stopped campaigning for her altogether.', 'It won’t be enough for host Conan O’Brien to make pointed jokes about old tweets on Oscar night. And it makes Emilia Pérez a very unlikely winner now in any major category, save for Best Supporting Actress, where Zoe Saldaña, so long as she does a very sober job of withholding solidarity, remains the favourite.

It starts with the candidates throwing their hats into the ring (at film festivals and premieres). Then, the backers of candidates that show potential (based on reactions and reviews) begin finessing their pitches (emphasizing narratives that present them in the best possible light) and courting voters (at screenings and receptions, and through Q&As and interviews). Some advance to the primaries and caucuses (the many other awards shows that precede the Oscars). And then comes Election Day (Oscar night itself).', '', 'But the similarities don’t end there. While it’s certainly true that the implications of winning a political election are more important and far-reaching than the implications of winning an Oscar, the potential rewards of winning an Oscar — reputational, monetary and otherwise — are significant enough that they, too, can cause people to behave in distasteful ways and/or result in others searching for and exposing past bad behavior.', 'Case-in-point: Karla Sofía Gascón, the Spanish actress who played the title character in Emilia Pérez, and who was rewarded with a best actress Oscar nomination on Jan. 23, which made her the first trans person ever to be named an acting finalist by the Academy.', 'Less than a week later, Gascón’s Oscar prospects, and entire life, completely imploded. In a Jan. 28 interview, she made comments that implied, without evidence, that people associated with fellow best actress Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres (I’m Still Here) were behind attacks on her, which prompted a swift backlash from many, including the army of Brazilians who have been passionately championing Torres and her film online all season long.', 'Shortly thereafter, coincidentally or not, tweets posted over the past few years by Gascón, containing bigoted commentary about a wide array of marginalized communities and even the Oscars itself, were unearthed and circulated on X (formerly Twitter). The whole thing has since gone viral and turned Gascón, who quickly deactivated her X account, into Hollywood’s version of Gary Condit, John Edwards or George Santos — in other words, completely toxic. At this point, Mel Gibson is probably more popular in town.', '', 'One can speculate that the exposure of Gascón’s tweets, and the timing of it, was not entirely organic. And one can also argue that Emilia Pérez distributor Netflix, with its deep pockets and dozens of people working specifically on awards efforts, should have caught them before investing millions into an Oscar campaign for a film with her at its center; after all, a similar situation, albeit involving just a single tweet, almost derailed the Oscar prospects of another divisive film, Green Book, six years ago.', 'But the bottom line, of course, is that Gascón did this to herself.', 'I find the whole situation to be shocking and sad.', 'I have interacted quite a bit with Gascón over the past few months at various festivals, events, interviews and Q&As, and saw no indication of this dark side. She had an unmistakably special bond with her co-stars, Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, and her director, Jacques Audiard. Often, she was accompanied by her young daughter, who struck me as a really impressive and terrific kid, and who must be feeling a lot of pain right now.', 'Beyond that, there is this: One doesn’t have to like Emilia Pérez to recognize that Gascón gave a courageous and daring performance in the film, and that her awards season success represented hope and progress for a lot of other people. Under different circumstances, she would have gone on to be celebrated at the Oscars, win or lose, and would have eventually wound up on a wall at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, described as a trailblazer alongside the likes of Sidney Poitier and Kathryn Bigelow.', '', 'But now, as a result of her behavior, her chances of winning the best actress Oscar, which were mixed to begin with, have been extinguished, and it’s possible that the same can be said for her future in the business altogether. And she has also severely damaged the Oscar prospects of her film — which was arguably the frontrunner for the best picture Oscar, having received a field-leading 13 nominations, just one shy of the all-time record — and, most unfairly of all, the prospects of her colleagues who were also nominated for the film, including Saldaña, who has been the best supporting actress frontrunner for months. Based on my conversations in recent days with Academy members, many are going to have a hard time voting for Emilia Pérez in any category, given that Emilia Pérez herself has become toxic.', 'Emilia Pérez is far from the first Oscar frontrunner to find itself caught up in “scandal” at a particularly inopportune moment in the awards season. Particularly over the last quarter-century or so, since the bare-knuckle Shakespeare in Love versus Saving Private Ryan brawl, accusations of varying degrees of legitimacy, and in some cases hazy origin, have threatened the prospects of A Beautiful Mind (the man played by Russell Crowe was said to be an antisemite); Slumdog Millionaire (accused of exploiting its Indian child actors); The Hurt Locker (a veteran claimed it ripped off his story); The King’s Speech (for allegedly falsifying history); and Green Book (for so many different things).', '', 'Interestingly enough, every one of those films still won the best picture Oscar. Academy members either deemed the claims false, misleading or immaterial to their assignment of evaluating the quality of a film. But the Gascón situation feels different than anything that has come before it, because her bad behavior is undeniable (although she has claimed that some of the tweets that have been circulated are doctored), indefensible (is there an ethnic group that she didn’t offend?) and completely contrary to what she and her movie are supposed to be about (namely, tolerance). Moreover, she has undermined the efforts of a lot of people who worked tirelessly on her behalf.', 'This is a very modern Oscars scandal, one that wouldn’t have been possible just a few years ago, before the advent of the internet and the rise of social media. As in politics, there have always been forms of opposition research mobilized in the Oscar race, but usually by strategists working on behalf of another campaign; I don’t condone that, but it’s the truth. In this case, though, all indications are that civilians — who may or may not be among a large number of people who vocally oppose “wokeness,” on one end of the spectrum, or who find Emilia Pérez’s depiction of trans people and Mexico to be offensively simplistic, on the other — took matters into their own hands, searching for, locating and circulating damaging information about someone who left them plenty of it to find.', 'Could these civilians have been aided and abetted by a rival campaign that would benefit from the downfall of Gascón and Emilia Pérez? Anything is possible and, in the age of the internet and social media, very hard to prove.

The star of the film Emilia Pérez, a musical drama about a trans cartel leader, made history earlier this month by becoming the first out trans woman to receive a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars. The film itself, directed by Frenchman Jacques Audiard, is the most nominated movie of the year. In what should be a moment of celebration, Gascón has instead found herself exposed as someone rather repugnant.', 'The tweets, which date back several years but were as recent as last year, involve astonishingly numerous screeds of racist, Islamophobic, and queerphobic rhetoric. She was anti-Asian racist towards the COVID-19 vaccination, called George Floyd a ‘drug addict swindler’, and derided the 93rd Academy Awards, where Daniel Kaluuya and Youn Yuh-jung were among the winners, as an ‘Afro-Korean festival.’ In one post, she said, ‘Sorry, is it just me or are there more Muslims in Spain? Every time I pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels. Next year instead of English, we’ll have to teach Arabic.’ That’s actually one of the tamer tweets in terms of her Islamophobia. The tweets just kept on coming, and it began to feel like Gascón had never tweeted a non-bigoted thing in her life.', 'The day after, Gascón issued a hilariously cheap and self-aggrandizing apology. She wrote, ‘All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.’ To which I say, you, Ms. Gascón, are the darkness.', 'Awards season campaigning is full of messy and often dirty tactics. The 2024 roster has frequently felt like a return to the days of Miramax-style aggression and subterfuge, with studios spending huge amounts of money to get their movie to the Academy stage. Netflix has not been shy in their agenda for Emilia Pérez, which they hope will land them their first-ever Best Picture winner. They beat out multiple studios to acquire the distribution rights for $8 million out of Cannes. They have sent out lavish FYC kits to critics and industry figures. Their campaign has largely hinged upon its historic precedence, and with Gascón as the face of that. She was pushed to Best Actress despite having less screen time than Zoe Saldana, who is nominated in the supporting category. She was the one who accepted the film’s Golden Globe award and talked eloquently about supporting trans people in the midst of a terrifying time for the community. A triumph for Emilia Pérez was a triumph for the trans community, so Netflix has wanted this season to declare. How very Weinstein-esque of them.', 'One has to wonder if Netflix set aside any money in their expensive awards campaign to media train their lead actress and sift through her social media history. That seems like a basic requirement for a 2025 Oscar run. Personally, I’m glad they didn’t do a clean-up. Let sunlight be the best disinfectant, right?', 'It barely mattered to them that the film has been, to put it mildly, controversial among both the trans and Mexican communities. It’s a film about a murderous cartel leader who transitions in secret and then returns to the limelight to be a faux-saint. Jacques Audiard has repeatedly admitted he did no research on either Mexico or the reality of cartel violence. GLAAD called it ‘a profoundly retrograde portrayal of a trans woman’ and ‘a step backward for trans representation.’ Spanish philosopher and filmmaker Paul B. Preciado, who made the excellent Orlando, My Political Biography, described the film as ‘a polysemic amalgam loaded with racism and transphobia, anti-Latino exoticism and melodramatic binarism’ that ‘reinforces the colonial and pathologizing narrative’ of both Mexican culture and gender transition. Trans-Mexican artists responded by making their own parody film called Johanne Sacreblu, about a trans heir to a baguette company.', 'Conflating a piece of art, however bad it may be, with the awful person headlining it is typically ill-advised. We’ve all watched films we love that star gross bigots and had to do the old separating of art and artist just to find the energy to get on with our lives. With Emilia Pérez, Netflix can help to take the blame for making this divide much harder. After all, they’re the company so desperate for Oscar glory that they steamrolled over months’ of concerns and criticism to push this one woman as being the ground-breaking face of a community they cared so little about. It should be a moment of celebration that an out trans actor has been Oscar-nominated after decades of watching cis men in dresses exemplify every nasty stereotype against trans women and perpetuate a cultural cruelty. Instead, it’s been a reminder that even marginalized people can be as bigoted as anyone else.', 'Frankly, it makes too much sense for the star of Emilia Pérez to be as close-minded and cruel as the film she headlines, all of which has been furiously sold as a sign of progress and the Academy’s new open-mindedness. One is almost worried that they’ll sympathize with Gascón more after those tweets since getting mad about industry diversity and hating Muslims isn’t something white elites are exactly punished for. The Academy notoriously doesn’t like being told what to do. Some voters admitted to doubling down in their support for Green Book after it faced criticism from Black critics and audiences over its Driving Miss Daisy-esque portrayal of race relations in the 1950s. I wouldn’t put it past them to throw their weight behind Emilia Pérez and reassert it as An Important Film.', 'But personally, I think this is the end of the road for Gascón’s campaign. I doubt there’s a PR-mandated apology good enough to mitigate her years of hatred but the one she gave certainly wasn’t close to appropriate. Her own self-importance has crumbled in the face of pure arrogance and repulsive bigotry that is a greater representation of Emilia Pérez than any FYC campaign could ever embody.']"

Netflix clearly didn’t either. The streamer was sitting pretty with Emilia Pérez and its 13 nominations—not only the most for a single film this year, but one short of the all-time record. Executives were probably already pulling out the Champagne before Best Actress frontrunner Karla Sofía Gascón swept in to annihilate not only her own chance at a statue, but potentially the entire movie’s with it.', 'If you haven’t waded into the depths of Gascón’s racist, Islamophobic, and violently hateful unearthed tweets, you may want to keep it that way. However bad you think they are, they’re probably worse. (There are simply too many to reprint in this brief newswire, but Jezebel has a good rundown here.)

Post-transitioning in 2018, Gascón made a small handful of other appearances as “Karla Sofia”.', 'Had she achieved international fame sooner, it’s surely probable that some kind of broader fan base would have existed, and more people would have looked askance at some of the incriminating tweets. Perhaps, with management guidance, she would have been more circumspect about casually venting. Indeed, the only way this current situation arises is because Gascón wasn’t a celebrity, in any real sense, before Emilia Pérez. She was a TV actor, thoroughly unknown outside the Spanish-speaking world.', 'As a PR disaster, this is up there with one of the most brutal to afflict an Oscar race in many years – much worse than Charlotte Rampling saying that the 2016 diversity row was “racist to white people”. It’s practically the Will Smith slap, if he had delivered it in tweet form to a range of minorities, and managed to time it before, and not after, the voting was done.', 'While Gascón’s tweets themselves are unconscionable, the disaster was entirely preventable, and this is what’s most bizarre. Netflix, who bought the film for $12 million following its success at Cannes, are entirely responsible for elevating Emilia Pérez to Oscar heavyweight status – indeed, with 13 nominations, it holds the record for the biggest tally a foreign-language film has ever received. To get that far – and with such an odd duck of a film to work with – requires the orchestration of an immensely intricate, concerted and expensive awards campaign. There’s a rumour floating around that 200 people are deployed by Netflix to concentrate on awards-season publicity alone.', 'With all of those resources, it beggars belief that no one on their team thought Gascón’s social media history might come under scrutiny, or had a cursory scroll backwards to make sure nothing was beyond the pale. If the most basic due diligence had been performed, she could have taken the precaution of deactivating her account – which she has now done, of course – and we’d be none the wiser about her written record of Islamophobia (and everything else).', 'Even before the tweets resurfaced, Gascón’s presence on socials was vehement, to say the least. She was mightily defensive about her Mexican accent, and went on the attack against the campaign for I’m Still Here star Fernanda Torres, her Best Actress rival, accusing that team of trying to discredit her.', 'It’s perhaps not surprising, then, that her response to the crisis has been chaotic and packed with denials, to the point where it has only made things worse. She arranged an hour-long interview with CNN en Español, supposedly without even telling Netflix, and continued to beat the drum tearfully, and unapologetically, about her remarks being taken out of context, and in some cases fabricated.', 'Did she really call her Emilia co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat”, in a since-deleted tweet from October 2022? She says that tweet was “not mine”. Equally, she says that an apparent defence of Hitler, for “simply having opinions about Jews”, was misunderstood.', 'Gascón’s very obscurity up to this point has been her calamitous undoing. She has leapt to notoriety in one bound, and the scandal has depressingly tarnished any coup for trans representation that her nomination, or her film, can ever claim in the future.', 'Hagi believes she should be disqualified, not just because of the tweets themselves, but because “she hasn’t explicitly apologised to the group she offended”. For her part, Gascón has said she will not withdraw from contention, which leaves the Academy mulling over this stain on the Best Actress category, with a month left to go. Netflix has now removed Gascón’s name from its Oscar ads, and seems to have stopped campaigning for her altogether.', 'It won’t be enough for host Conan O’Brien to make pointed jokes about old tweets on Oscar night. And it makes Emilia Pérez a very unlikely winner now in any major category, save for Best Supporting Actress, where Zoe Saldaña, so long as she does a very sober job of withholding solidarity, remains the favourite. Gascón will never live it down, unfortunately, and Netflix must shoulder a huge chunk of the blame.', '', '', '', '', '', '3/5', '4/5', '4/5', '', '']"

"Emilia Perez star Karla Sofia Gascon tears up, pleads 'not a racist' amid backlash over controversial tweets",https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/emilia-perez-star-karla-sofia-gascon-tears-up-pleads-not-a-racist-amid-backlash-over-controversial-tweets-101738592672088.html,"['', 'Karla Sofia Gascon, the Oscar-nominated star of Emilia Perez, fought back tears during an emotional interview as she addressed the controversy surrounding resurfaced social media posts. The 52-year-old actress, nominated for Best Actress for her role as a transgender crime boss in the Netflix musical, has faced intense backlash following offensive tweets she made over the past five years. The posts, which included remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and diversity at the Oscars, have quickly overshadowed her awards campaign, leading to a wave of criticism.', ""Also Read: Beyonce's ‘spectacular’ tour to celebrate ‘female empowerment’ after Grammy win"", 'Gascon insisted that she is not “a racist” in her hour-long interview with CNN es Espanol as she cried and addressed her controversial social media history. Talking to interviewer Juan Carlos Arciniegas, the actor was asked if she would renounce her Oscar nomination, first-ever awarded to an openly transgender actor. She said, “I cannot renounce a nomination because what I have done is a job and what is being valued is my acting work,” as translated by The Hollywood Reporter.', 'Gascon continued, “I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone. I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am."" She addressed her tweet about George Floyd who was murdered by a white police officer in 2020 and led to Black Lives Matter. She called Floyd a “drug addict and a hustler,” and wrote, “his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong.”', 'She said that her now-deleted tweet was misinterpreted as she told the media outlet, “He was a person who had been in a very difficult situation in his life and no one had helped him, and suddenly he becomes a symbol of a cause and everyone loved him.” She added, “But for someone to think that … I have ever insulted a person because of their skin colour, I do not allow that to anyone, to anyone.”', 'Also Read: Trevor Noah faces heat over ‘tasteless’ jokes on illegal immigrants, Colombians and Shakira; netizens seek ‘apology’', 'In response to the backlash over tweets condemned as Islamophobic, Gascon explained that she was expressing criticism of radical Islam and never intended to harm anyone. She shared about her relationship with a Muslim woman “whom I adore, whom I love and who has taught me so much about respect for people.”', 'She continued, “What have I done in my life? What have I done? I haven’t killed a single fly. When I have a spider in my house I put a little glass on it so as not to kill it and take it out to the street,” as per the translation by Deadline.', 'Gascon offered her “most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended for the way I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future,” adding, “I believe I have been judged, I have been convicted and sacrificed and crucified and stoned without a trial and without the option to defend myself.”', 'While many of the tweets circulating on social media are real, some are fake such as teh one post where she described her co-star Selena Gomes as a “rich rat.” About the tweet, Gascon said, “It’s not mine, of course. I have never said anything about my colleague I would never refer to her that way.""', 'She claimed that people “have dedicated themselves to searching, to put together all the things that I had said at a time that I had written, most of which are false … most of them I don’t even recognise that I wrote them. And they put them all together and so it seems that she is a very bad person and we remove her [from the Oscar race] just when we can do the most damage, right in the voting period.""', 'The actor added that she “doesn’t give a damn about awards.” She continued, “What I do care about is the people that I represent, because of what I represent in this world. We can all change and be better people in this world."" The interview took place without any involvement of Netflic who distributed the film, Emilia Perez.', '', '', '']"
"Karla Sofía Gascón’s Years-Old Social Media Posts About George Floyd, Islam Cause Stir Online",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/karla-sofia-gascon-tweets-george-floyd-islam-controversy-emilia-perez-1236122525/,"['', '', 'The \'Emilia Pérez\' star is under fire for online declarations suggesting that the religion should be banned and that Floyd was a ""hustler and drug dealer.""', 'BY CHRIS GARDNER', 'On the heels of a dust-up with supporters of fellow best actress Oscars nominee Fernanda Torres, Karla Sofía Gascón is catching heat for fiery takes she posted online in recent years about everything from Islam to George Floyd.', 'The Emilia Pérez star’s posts on X (formerly Twitter) started to make the rounds early Thursday morning with multiple users sharing screenshots and critical takes of Gascón’s opinions. For example, less than a month after George Floyd was murdered in Minnesota in 2020, inciting nationwide Black Lives Matter rallies, Gascón shared a thread recapping her views.', '', '“Let me get this straight, a guy tries to pass off a counterfeit bill after consuming methamphetamine, an idiot policeman arrives and goes too far in arresting him, killing him, ruining the lives of his family and his colleagues, and turning the guy with the bill into a martyr hero,” she wrote (in Spanish, which was translated here by Google Translate). “I truly believe that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler, but his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong.”', 'Later that year, she took aim at Muslims in her native Spain.', '“Sorry, is it just my impression or are there more and more Muslims in Spain? Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels,” she posted on Nov. 23, 2020. “Maybe next year instead of English we’ll have to teach Arabic.”', 'Regarding Islam, she suggested a ban: “Until we ban religions that go against European values and violate human rights, such as Islam, under the protection of freedom of worship, we will not end part of the huge problem we face. Faith manipulates those who cling to faith.” Gascón also shared thoughts on the 2021 Oscar telecast, which saw the best picture prize going to Nomadland: “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films, I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M. Apart from that, an ugly, ugly gala.”', 'Vanity Fair writer Chris Murphy weighed in by commenting on Gascón’s posts about Floyd: “You can’t make this stuff up … for the love of God do not give this woman an Oscar!!!” Gascón made history as the first trans performer to be nominated as best actress while her film, from writer-director Jacques Audiard, topped the field with 13 nominations for Netflix.', '', 'Shortly after 10 a.m. this morning, some of Gascón’s posts started disappearing, including the one about Floyd that had still been live earlier in the day.', 'Later Thursday she apologized for her past tweets.', '“As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain,” she said in part. “All my life I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”', 'By Friday, Gascón’s X account had been deactivated. She explained the move to close her X account in an exclusive statement to The Hollywood Reporter, saying in part, I can no longer allow this campaign of hate and misinformation to affect my family or me.”', 'Many users expressed surprise, not that the outspoken Spanish actress posted her thoughts in the first place — freedom of speech is protected — but that amid an always-heated awards season race, the posts remained up on the site for as long as they did. Top contenders like Gascón are always surrounded by teams of publicists and strategists who are experts in the fields of media training and public perception.', 'this is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh. stuff like this doesn’t get flagged because you can say whatever you want about muslims, it’s never considered racist. again, this isn’t even all of them pic.twitter.com/Cq8rQaiSmm', 'The swirl comes after Gascón suggested in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper that online forces are at work in an attempt to smear her and the Emilia Pérez team. “What I don’t like are social media teams — people who work with these people — trying to diminish our work, like me and my movie, because that doesn’t lead anywhere. You don’t need to tear down someone’s work to highlight another’s. I have never, at any point, said anything bad about Fernanda Torres or her movie. However, there are people working with Fernanda Torres tearing me and Emilia Pérez down. That speaks more about their movie than mine.”', '', 'Once the comments went viral, countless X users tagged the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences claiming that Gascón’s comments violated Academy rules of making disparaging remarks of another contender. However, the Academy has concluded that no rules were violated — Gascón did not comment on or denigrate Torres’ performance or film — but Gascón did release a statement to Variety to clarify the situation.', '“I am an enormous fan of Fernanda Torres and it has been wonderful getting to know her the past few months,” Gascón said in the statement. “In my recent comments, I was referencing the toxicity and violent hate speech on social media that I sadly continue to experience. Fernanda has been a wonderful ally, and no one directly associated with her has been anything but supportive and hugely generous.”', 'In a recent cover story with THR, Gascón shrugged off the online vitriol she receives as a transgender actress. “Social media is a lie,” she said. “The reality is in the street. It’s people who come up to you to say thank you.”', 'Jan. 31, 10:58 a.m. This story has been updated with Gascón’s apology and information about her closing her X account.', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"
Karla Sofía Gascón Breaks Down Repeatedly in Hour-Long TV Interview: “I Am Not a Racist”,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/karla-sofia-gascon-breaks-down-cnn-interview-tweets-1236124950/,"['', '', ""By turns tearful and defiant, the 'Emilia Pérez' star told CNN en Español that controversial past tweets, which have thrown her Oscar campaign into disarray, were intentionally misrepresented and in some cases fabricated in a effort to scuttle her awards chances."", 'BY JULIAN SANCTON', 'Best-actress Oscar nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, whose awards campaign for Emilia Pérez was thrown into disarray last week by the revelation of years-old tweets widely seen as expressing bigoted views, addressed the controversy in a tearful, hourlong interview with CNN en Español on Saturday evening. ', 'By turns defiant and penitent, the Spanish actress broke down repeatedly in defending herself against accusations of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia. While expressing regret for how her words have been interpreted, she also cast suspicion over the timing of the revelations, implying that they were part of an effort to sabotage her awards chances. Gascón is the first openly transgender performer to be nominated for an Oscar in an acting category.', '', 'CNN en Español anchor Juan Carlos Arciniegas struggled to interrupt Gascón, whose outpouring appeared at times to be more of a monologue. Pressed by Arciniegas about whether she would renounce her Oscar nomination in light of the controversy, Gascón dismissed the idea out of hand: “I cannot renounce a nomination because what I have done is a job and what is being valued is my acting work,” she told the anchor. “And I cannot renounce a nomination either because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone, I am not a racist, nor am I anything that all these people have taken it upon themselves to try to make others believe that I am.”', 'The Hollywood Reporter has learned that Gascón set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix.', 'Gascón began the interview with an apology for her since-deleted tweets (she deactivated her X account on Friday), echoing the contrition she has repeatedly shown over the past week. “My most sincere apologies to all the people who may have felt offended by the ways I express myself in my past, in my present and in my future.”', 'Among the Gascón tweets under scrutiny are opinions she shared on the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, which launched a global racial reckoning: “I truly believe that very few people ever cared about George Floyd, a drug addict and a hustler,” she tweeted at the time, “but his death has served to highlight once again that there are those who still consider Black people to be monkeys without rights and those who consider the police to be murderers. All wrong.”', '', 'She also drew condemnation for her position on Islam, calling for a ban of the religion in the name of human rights. A sample tweet from 2020: “Sorry, is it just my impression or are there more and more Muslims in Spain? Every time I go to pick up my daughter from school there are more women with their hair covered and their skirts down to their heels.”', 'Regarding George Floyd, Gascón said that she had merely intended to point out the hypocrisy surrounding his elevation as a symbol of oppression. “He was a person who had been in a very difficult situation in his life and no one had helped him, and suddenly he becomes a symbol of a cause and everyone loved him,” she told Arciniegas.', '“But for someone to think that …  I have ever insulted a person because of their skin color, I do not allow that to anyone, to anyone,” Gascón added, visibly angry, and waving a finger at the camera. ', 'In defending herself against accusations of Islamophobia, Gascón explained through tears that she had a deep personal relationship with a Muslim woman “whom I adore, whom I love and who has taught me so much about respect for people.”', 'She specified that what she opposed was radical Islam, adding that she was personally affected by the 2004 train bombings in Madrid, which occurred near her home.  ', 'She said she had gone out of her way to avoid causing harm to anyone or anything: “What have I done in my life? What have I done? I haven’t killed a single fly. When I have a spider in my house I put a little glass on it so as not to kill it and take it out to the street.', '', 'Gascón said that many of her tweets that have caused offense were misinterpreted; they were not expressing her own opinions but rather voicing a hypothetical opinion she condemned. Such was the case, she said, with a 2019 tweet that critics have described as defending Adolf Hitler: “This is the same old story, ‘blacks [are slaves] and women in the kitchen.’ But it is my opinion and it must be respected. I do not understand such world war against Hitler, he simply had his opinion about the jews. \nWell, that’s how the world goes.” ', 'Some of the screenshots of tweets circulating online, Gascón said, were not merely taken out of context or misrepresented, but outright fabricated. This was the case, she said, with one screenshot of a tweet attributed to her, calling her Emilia Pérez co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat.” ', '“Of course that’s not mine,” Gascón told CNN. “I have never said anything about my partner. I would never refer to her that way.” The actress suggested that the allegedly false tweet was part of a targeted campaign against her: “I start thinking about where this comes from.”', 'The voting period for the Academy Awards will end on Feb. 18, and Gascón implied that the timing of the revelations was no accident, alluding to a dirty tricks campaign against her. “They have dedicated themselves to searching, to put together all the things that I had said at a time that I had written —most of which are false … most of them I don’t even recognize that I wrote them,” Gascón said. “And they put them all together and so it seems that she is a very bad person and we remove her just when we can do the most damage, right in the in the voting period.”', '', 'It is impossible to know how the controversy might affect the results of the best-actress race, which has been typically tight. But Gascón told CNN en Español that winning the prize was not her priority.', '“I don’t give a damn about awards,” she claimed. “What I do care about is the people that I represent, because of what I represent in this world,” as a transgender trailblazer. “We can all change and be better people in this world.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.']"

The disturbing tweets — and messy apology tour — blowing up Emilia Pérez’s Oscars campaign,https://www.vox.com/culture/397810/emilia-perez-karla-sofia-gascon-oscars-netflix,"['When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own.', 'We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?', 'Karla Sofía Gascón made history as an openly trans Oscar nominee. Now she’s apologizing for hateful posts.', 'by Kyndall Cunningham', 'Since its arrival on Netflix in December, the Spanish-language French film Emilia Pérez has been a nesting doll of controversies. The musical, directed by Jacques Audiard, has been slammed by critics and on social media for its regressive portrayal of trans identity. The film has also been critiqued for its “Eurocentric” depiction of Mexico — even inspiring a viral spoof film made by Mexican filmmakers, called Johanne Sacreblu — and Audiard himself has made dismissive if not offensive comments about Mexico and the Spanish language. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the movie’s Oscar lead actress, Karla Sofía Gascón, was most notable for being at war with “Brazilian Twitter” for comments she made about her Best Actress rival Fernanda Torres’s social media team.', 'Despite all this, Emilia Pérez is up for 13 Oscar nominations and is predicted to pick up at least one for Zoe Saldaña in the Best Supporting Actress category. Gascón’s Oscar hopes are likely done, however, following a series of offensive, resurfaced tweets in what might be one of the most surprising scandals in Oscars history.', 'On Wednesday, after Gascón was already in the news for her comments about Torres, X users began circulating years-old tweets from the Spanish actress using derogatory language aimed at marginalized communities. The tweets, from as recent as 2021, include disturbing remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and even the nonwhite winners of the 2021 Oscars ceremony. Other tweets find her casually using anti-gay and other hateful language.', 'The Oscars aren’t unfamiliar with controversy. However, the mounting issues corroding the Emilia Pérez Oscar campaign are pretty extraordinary — and even make the controversy surrounding 2019 Best Picture Green Book look quaint in comparison. In the days since her old tweets were exposed, Gascón has arguably dug herself (and the film) into a deeper hole, giving insufficient apologies and even implying that her calling-out is some sort of conspiracy. Likewise, it’s an ironic but extremely familiar trajectory for a movie that has been bolstered by the Hollywood establishment for its diversity and “progressive” themes.', 'On Thursday, journalist Sarah Hagi posted a thread with screenshots of more than a dozen tweets from Gascón (in her native Spanish) disparaging Islam and immigrants from the Arabic countries. In one tweet posted on July 2, 2016, and translated by Vox editor Izzie Ramirez, she says, “Islam is becoming an infection for humanity that needs to be cured urgently.” In another tweet from September 2, 2020, Gascón, who is from Spain, posted a photo of a Muslim family, including a woman wearing a burka, in a restaurant, mocking the role of women in Islam. In the tweet, she sarcastically decried the wearing of burkhas and what she perceives as the lack of respect for women in Islam, capping it off with a phrase that translates to “the deepest revulsion of humanity.”', 'In other posts, she points out the rising number of Muslims in Spain, lamenting that schools will start to teach Arabic instead of English. She blames Islam for several terrorist attacks. There are also multiple tweets where she a European slur referring to Muslims or people with dark skin.', 'Users then began circulating a startling now-deleted thread she apparently posted on June 8, 2020, about Floyd, whose death by a police officer ignited worldwide Black Lives Matter protests. In the first post, a user with Gascón’s name says, “Let me see if I understand, a guy tried to pass off a counterfeit bill after taking meth, an idiot cop arrives, and goes too far in arresting him and kills him, ruining the lives of his family and friends, and then then guy with the bill turns into a heroic marytr.” In another statement in the thread, the user refers to Floyd as a “drug addict and a hustler.”', 'The X account also exposed other unsavory comments, like a joke about China and Covid-19, and casual use of hateful language. A post about the 2021 Oscars ceremonies, read, “More and more the #Oscars are looking like a ceremony for independent and protest films. I didn’t know if I was watching an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or the 8M [feminist strike],” referring to an International Women’s Day march, which takes place on March 8. Users also found a bizarre post where she refers to paparazzi photos of Miley Cyrus cozying up with a woman as “lesbian perversion.” This post might be seen as particularly baffling, as Gascón is herself a trans woman who is married to another woman.', 'Gascón’s X account has since been deleted, although screenshots of her comments still abound online. On Friday, she also gave a terse apology to Variety: “I want to acknowledge the conversation around my past social media posts that have caused hurt. As someone in a marginalized community, I know this suffering all too well, and I am deeply sorry to those I have caused pain. All my life, I have fought for a better world. I believe light will always triumph over darkness.”', 'She had previously sent a more defiant exclusive statement to the Hollywood Reporter, explaining why she deleted her account. In that statement, she called the backlash a “campaign of hate and misinformation,” while implying that the opinions she stated have changed:', '“As part of this society, I have expressed my disagreement or agreement with all the related issues that have touched me and of which I have had an opinion, often erroneous, which has changed throughout my own experience. I have always used my social media as a diary, reflections or notes, to later create stories or characters, not as something that would be scrutinized down to the last of its 140 characters, since sometimes I, myself, am not even aware of having written something negative.”', 'On February 3, she addressed the controversy on Instagram in a statement that partly reads: “They have already won. They have achieved their objective, to stain my existence with lies or things taken out of context.” Later that evening, she appeared on CNN en Español where she sat down for a tear-filled, hour-long interview to clarify the context of her tweets and claimed that they aren’t representative of her character. She also alluded to a possible smear campaign, pointing out the timing of the resurfaced tweets during the Oscars voting period, which ends on February 18.', '“They put them all together so it seems that she is a very bad person, and we remove her just when we can do the most damage right in the voting period,” she told anchor Juan Carlos Arciniegas. She also said a post credited to her where she calls her Emilia Pérez co-star Selena Gomez a “rich rat” was fabricated. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Gascón set up the interview independently “without the involvement of anyone working on the film,” including its distributor, Netflix.', 'So far, Saldaña is Gascón’s only co-star to address her resurfaced posts. At an Emilia Pérez Q&A in London on January 31, where Gascon was expected to appear but pulled out, Saldaña said she was “still processing” Gascón’s remarks. “It makes me really sad because I don’t support [it],” she said. “And I don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric toward people of any group. I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural, and gender equity. And it just saddens me.”', 'For decades, the sabotaged Oscars campaign has been a fascinating — and typically amusing — phenomenon of awards season. Outside of Gascón’s antics, this year alone has seen several other controversies threaten the chances of certain Oscar hopefuls. Last week, the editor of 10-time Oscar nominee The Brutalist, Dávid Jancsó, revealed that he utilized AI to perfect Adrien Brody’s Hungarian speech in a brief part of the film. This led to questions about whether Brody’s performance, which has already earned him a Golden Globe, should be re-evaluated.', 'Meanwhile, in the midst of Gascón’s controversy, social media users found an article that her rival Torres had written slamming Amber Heard during her 2023 defamation trial against her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as well as a resurfaced video of Torres appearing in blackface in comedy sketch on a Brazilian TV show, for which she apologized earlier this week.', 'Other times, these flubbed campaigns have often emerged from aggressive PR measures, from the Bette Davis infamous write-in campaign to the supposed “overkill” of Diana Ross’s Best Actress campaign ads for Lady Sings the Blues to Melissa Leo’s self-funded “Consider…” plea — although she ultimately went on to receive her Oscar. This sort of zealous campaign was famously codified by former film producer Harvey Weinstein. Before Gascón’s scandal, the mantle for the most controversial recent Best Actress nominee belonged to Andrea Riseborough, who caused a huge kerfuffle when she received a surprising nod in 2023 for the small Sundance film To Leslie, due to sudden endorsements by celebrities and a dubious email sent to voters. The last-minute but shockingly efficient campaign ultimately didn’t go against the Academy’s lobbying rules, but it did put a mark on the actress leading up to the awards show.', 'In general, though, it’s much more rare that a contender’s Oscars chances have been tainted if not completely shattered due to hate speech — the most recent example being Lars von Trier’s antisemitic comments during a press conference for his 2011 film Melancholia. Still, Gascón’s controversy presents a more complex and head-scratching case, given that Gascón is the first openly trans acting nominee. Despite how groundbreaking her nomination is on paper, her hateful comments on social media blot out any perception that her nomination is a win for progress. Awards forecaster Scott Feinberg also claimed that Gascón’s tweets have “severely damaged the Oscar prospects of her film,” outside of the Best Actress category. “Based on my conversations in recent days with Academy members, many are going to have a hard time voting for Emilia Pérez in any category, given that Emilia Pérez herself has become toxic,” said the Hollywood Reporter journalist.', 'Her controversial comments also present a legitimate conundrum for the ceremony. Folks are already wondering how she’ll be included in the Best Actress presentation. The Academy recently announced that it would be bringing back the “Fab 5” format, where previous acting winners give a heartfelt introduction to each of the nominees. There’s also always the possibility for more vocal backlash and even boycotts from the groups she targeted.', 'Overall, Gascón’s remarks have only continued to illuminate the shallowness of Emilia Pérez as a project and a “progressive” pick for the Academy. Following her scandal, folks have openly questioned why a European woman was cast in the role of a Mexican character, and recirculated comments about Audiard professing his own ignorance about Mexico. They’ve also affected any remaining amount of goodwill that the movie had going for it, including a powerful statement Gascón made at the Golden Globes earlier in January, when the film won Best Picture — Musical or Comedy.', '“The light always wins over darkness,” she said. “You can put us in jail, you can beat us up, but you can never take away our soul or our resistance or our identity. I want to say to you, raise your voice and say that I won, I am who I am, not who you want [me to be].” Who knew that, a few weeks later, it’d be recycled for an apology?', 'Update, February 3, 10:50 am ET: This story was originally published on January 31, 2025, and has been updated several times, most recently to include Karla Sofía Gascón’s CNN en Español interview, her Instagram post, and Zoe Saldaña’s response.', 'Correction, February 3, 1:30 pm ET: An earlier version of this story misstated when Karla Sofía Gascón posted on Instagram and appeared on CNN en Español.
