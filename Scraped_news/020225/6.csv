In 2023, the agency managed more than $40bn (£32bn).', 'Countless aid organisations have already been forced to close down or lay off staff.', 'Analysis confirms that several thousand women and girls are likely to die from complications during pregnancy and childbirth as a direct result of Trump’s order to freeze aid to the agency for 90 days.', 'Trump has tasked the billionaire Musk – who has falsely accused USAid of being a “criminal” organisation – with scaling down the US government’s lead agency for humanitarian assistance.', 'The impact on the global aid sector has been profound and immediate.

To cut it, suddenly, is going to have a terrible humanitarian effect.”', 'Elsewhere, the director of a major international aid organisation in Colombia – who also requested anonymity – feared the impact on those who most needed help. “The people who this is going to affect the most are those already without a safety net. Precisely those who are least able to find another source of food, shelter or income,” they said.', 'However, some have argued that the disruption has exposed the fragility of development programmes that are reliant on external aid.', 'The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta urged African countries to view the aid freeze as a “wake-up call” for the continent to prioritise its own development.', '“Nobody is going to continue holding out a hand to give you. It is time for us to use our resources for the right things,” he said.', 'Most, though, are adamant that the intention of Trump and Musk – who heads an unofficial cost-cutting agency – to close USAid is disastrous.', '“Without naming countries or areas, we have had to close life-saving services, for children with acute malnutrition, and also testing and treatment sites for health facilities, nutrition facilities and wash facilities,” said one aid worker.', 'Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a former official at USAid, described Musk’s wish to close the agency as posing an existential threat to the humanitarian sector.', '“If this goes forward, it really is an extinction-level event for the global aid sector in the US and for much of the global relief and development sector around the world.”', 'Konyndyk added that it would also “destabilise” budgets of many large aid and United Nations organisations around the world. “It threatens really the collapse not just of what USAid does, but of this huge ecosystem of relief and development organisations that are doing good around the world every day,” he said.', 'Research from the Guttmacher Institute underlined such warnings, revealing that 11.7 million women and girls will be denied access to contraceptive care over the course of the 90-day aid freeze, which they predict means 8,340 women and girls would die from complications during pregnancy and childbirth.', 'Elsewhere, concern over the fate of the humanitarian sector was laid bare in a survey of 342 international development organisations, which concluded that without US funding, more than half were likely to close before May.', 'Attempts by the US government to soften the impact of its freeze by unveiling a waiver for projects offering “life-saving assistance” appears to have done little except prompt further confusion.', '“Is Plumpy’Nut [a paste used to feed severely malnourished children] life-saving? Is a vaccine life-saving? What is a life-saving part of a project? What qualifies under the waiver?” an aid worker asked.', 'A “global aid freeze” tracker has been set up to look at the collective impact of the orders, inviting civil society organisations to input data.']"

If there\'s going to be aid, it should come through other transparent channels—that\'s the real issue,"" Sheinbaum said.', 'She cited the case of Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad (MCCI), which her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (2018–2024), labeled as ""coup-mongering"" after the group published investigations involving his sons and government officials—a frequent source of tension with Washington.', '""This agency has funded everything from research projects to groups that oppose the government. In Mexico, \'Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción\' has received proven support from this agency. So how is it that these so-called \'aid\' agencies get involved in politics?""

Trump’s USAID Purge and Foreign Aid Turmoil Spark Global Security Concerns,https://www.csis.org/analysis/trumps-usaid-purge-and-foreign-aid-turmoil-spark-global-security-concerns,"['Photo: J. David Ake/Getty Images', 'Commentary by Noam Unger', 'Published February 3, 2025', 'Over the past fortnight, the administration has prohibited all new programming and issued a broad “stop-work” order on existing U.S. foreign assistance programs. In one fell swoop it removed more than 50 career civil and foreign service leaders of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and then suspended others for allegedly trying to maintain basic rules associated with employment terminations or security related to sensitive and classified information. In a whirlwind, the clamp down included the removal of USAID’s account from X and its website from the internet. Yesterday, the administration conveyed its intent to shut down the agency as rumors also swirled that President Trump will effectively force the battered organization into the Department of State. Today, employees were informed in the wee hours of the morning not to show up at USAID’s headquarters, and later in the day, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he is taking over as the agency’s acting administrator. In this same time period, hundreds of USAID contract employees have been laid off or furloughed. Nongovernmental organizations and other humanitarian and development enterprises that partner with the U.S. government through grants and contracts have laid off well over a thousand employees so far. While many humanitarian and development programs sputtered to a standstill, and as thousands of people working to improve lives, livelihoods, health, and freedoms internationally were separated from their jobs, vulnerable communities around the world began to feel the effects of a vanishing partner.', 'Although some administration leaders have harshly derided the agency based on caricatures, USAID has actually represented American ideas in action. I worked there during three presidential administrations, including the first Trump administration. The people who served at the agency across all different hiring categories, including foreign service nationals, contract employees, civil service leaders, and foreign service officers, struck me as a particularly dedicated and highly trained group. There was always a mix of conservatives and liberals, though such viewpoints seldom came through in the nonpartisan work of the agency, executed with bipartisan U.S. political support. These experts—many with years of experience in specialty areas of agriculture, economics, security, and public health—are exemplary public servants, and many routinely put their lives on the line. That’s why the entrance of USAID’s lobby has featured a solemn memorial to the employees who lost their lives doing such work on behalf of the American people.', 'There are real reasons to care about development and humanitarian aid. Its share of the federal budget, less than one hundredth, should not be one of them. Despite its relatively small size and a name that subtly belies its importance, foreign aid is critical to U.S. foreign policy, national security, and international standing. Through U.S. global health programs focused on AIDS and malaria, for example, the United States has saved more than 35 million lives around the world over the past couple of decades. Programs to strengthen health systems additionally identify and contain the spread of infectious diseases, work essential to any commitment to maintain or even improve the health of Americans.', 'Assistance focused on food, water, and agricultural markets to prevent hunger is another easily recognizable area of development and humanitarian support. After all, the United States is the largest provider of food assistance. But strategic financial support in this and other areas is about a lot more than direct service delivery. Better systems and information are key. Take, for example, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which was initially created by USAID during the Reagan administration in response to crises in Africa. That U.S. innovation developed into one of the world’s preeminent sources of information and analysis about impending food crises, demonstrating the value of such technology-fueled information management programs for U.S. efforts ranging from Sudan to Afghanistan. Such systems, drawing on satellite-enabled remote sensing data and collaborative networks across the U.S. government and globally, only become more important in a world of increasingly extreme weather impacts. As of this past week, FEWS NET and so many other valuable programs supported by U.S. foreign assistance were halted and pulled offline.', 'All of this is not to say that reforming foreign aid is unimportant. Rather it is continuously needed. Recent presidential administrations have each implemented numerous reforms to make U.S. foreign assistance operate more effectively and efficiently. Whether it was to make programs faster, more transparent, or more likely to strengthen a stricken community’s ability to pick itself back up in the future, working with Congress was always a key ingredient for successful reform. The Bush administration’s establishment of the Millennium Challenge Corporation enabled bigger, longer-term infrastructure investment partnerships with promising country partners, while the first Trump administration stood up the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. These investment-oriented innovations, developed closely with Congress, are worth continuing to build upon while leveraging USAID’s private sector engagement programs and its on-the-ground presence in countries around the world.', 'With regard to USAID’s future, Musk has said it is “time for it to die,” and that President Trump has agreed to shut it down. Every administration over the last 75 years has wanted to shape foreign aid in line with its goals, but making an imprint on U.S. foreign assistance is one thing, turning it into a fossil is another. Hollowing out and then strangling the system into extinction through executive actions is akin to throwing away our toolbox or unilaterally disarming at a time of mounting geopolitical competition for partnerships globally. It does not make us safer or well-positioned to influence the world for the better.', 'In reaction to the Trump administration’s early steps, news coverage is increasingly drawing attention to transnational threats mitigated by foreign assistance, like corruption, conflict, and criminal networks connected to the trafficking of people and drugs. Some Democratic members of Congress held a press event at the front doors of the agency headquarters to voice their concerns. Well-researched news stories on community impacts and U.S. global standing will surely follow. The damage from an ongoing bureaucratic purge, and the associated chain reaction, however, will already be severe.', 'We should all care about foreign aid—we should care enough to make it better, not kill it. While a more measured approach to sharpening U.S. tools of foreign assistance and national security investments would be prudent, that does not seem to be in the offing. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, the branch of government that should have the authority to establish, fund, or dissolve entire agencies of the U.S. government, should demand it.', 'Noam Unger is the director of the Sustainable Development and Resilience Initiative and a senior fellow with the Project on Prosperity and Development at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.', 'Commentary is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Foreign assistance has always been a tool for furthering U.S. national security interests.

', 'But foreign aid does more than spread goodwill and positive attitudes toward the U.S. A world that is freer (USAID supports democracy promotion programs), more economically liberal (USAID fosters local entrepreneurship and economic growth), healthier and better educated is also less prone to conflict. That’s because countries that are democratic, enjoy higher living standards and are intertwined in the global economic system are less likely to go to war with their neighbors. As the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, has noted, “USAID’s efforts can do as much — over the long term — to prevent conflict as the deterrent effects of carrier strike group or a marine expeditionary force.” Or, as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates put it, “Development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers.”', 'Taking USAID and U.S. foreign assistance off the global chessboard creates a political vacuum that other countries — like China — can fill.

Can the President Dissolve USAID by Executive Order?,https://www.justsecurity.org/107267/can-president-dissolve-usaid-by-executive-order/,"['by Tess Bridgeman', 'February 1, 2025', 'Civil service, Congress, Department of State, Donald Trump, Executive Orders, Foreign Aid/Foreign Assistance, humanitarian assistance, Security Assistance, Trump administration second term, USAID', '', '', 'President Donald Trump may be preparing to issue an Executive Order (E.O.) purporting to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and fold some or all of its functions into the State Department, according to reporting that emerged on Friday, Jan. 31. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Chris Murphy (D-CT), among others, immediately objected that the president does not have the authority to dismantle USAID without an act of Congress. As of Sat., Feb. 1, the USAID website appeared to have gone dark. Dissolving USAID would be a final assault on the foreign aid agency, where the administration already has issued a stop-work order for huge swaths of development assistance and other aid, abruptly put at least 56 of its senior career staffers on administrative leave, and laid off several hundred contractors working directly for the agency. ', 'Such an action, however, likely would go far beyond the executive branch’s actual legal authority. The bottom line: while some functions delegated from the president to the secretary of state, and in turn to the administrator of USAID, could likely be pulled back by executive action alone, wholesale dissolution of the agency or formal transfer of functions provided by Congress would require legislation. Let’s unpack why.', 'No, not lawfully. In 1961, USAID was created by an E.O. issued by President John F. Kennedy (E.O. 10973), based in part on authority provided in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. But a later act of Congress (The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, 22 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) established USAID as its own agency. In a section titled “Status of AID” (22 U.S.C. 6563) it states:', 'Unless abolished pursuant to the reorganization plan submitted under section 6601 of this title, and except as provided in section 6562 of this title, there is within the Executive branch of Government the United States Agency for International Development as an entity described in section 104 of title 5. (emphasis added)', 'The key language here is “there is within the Executive branch of Government [USAID]” (see sections 6562/6563). Those are the words Congress uses to establish an agency within the executive branch. It would take an act of Congress to reverse that – simply put, the president may not unilaterally override a statute by executive order.  ', 'The 1998 statute also transfers only certain functions of USAID to the State Department, and in essence requires USAID to handle all other pre-existing USAID functions described in the Foreign Assistance Act. This means that, at a minimum, Congress asserted a role for itself in such transfers of functions as well as early as 1998. ', 'Also in the 1998 Act, Congress gave the president a near-term, time-limited opportunity to reorganize these departments (22 USC 6601). Specifically, the Act provides, among other things, that within “60 days after October 21, 1998,” the president may, in a “reorganization plan and report” to be provided to Congress:', '“(1) … provide for the abolition of the Agency for International Development and the transfer of all its functions to the Department of State or (2) in lieu of the abolition and transfer of functions . . . provide for the transfer to and consolidation within the Department of the functions set forth in section 6581 of this title; and may provide for additional consolidation, reorganization, and streamlining of AID . . .”  ', 'President Bill Clinton submitted the statutorily-envisioned report to Congress on Dec. 30, 1998, within Congress’ specified 60-day window. In that report, the Clinton administration explicitly chose to retain the independence of USAID as its own agency (while providing for certain forms of coordination and resource sharing). It stated: ', '(d) United States Agency for International Development. Effective April 1, 1999, the United States Agency for International Development shall continue as an independent establishment in the Executive Branch.', 'Congress provided the president the opportunity to modify or revise that plan (6601(e)) until the effective date of the reorganization plan, which the 1998 Act specified as no later than April 1, 1999 with respect to some USAID functions, and Oct. 1, 1999, with respect to the opportunity for abolition of the agency (6601(g)(2)). No prospective modification or reorganization authority was granted to the president beyond those effective dates. ', 'Finally, a much more recent provision of law – section 7063 of the FY24 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (later incorporated into the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024) – explicitly requires both congressional consultation and notification to Congress for reorganizations, consolidations, or downsizing of USAID. Absent consultation and notification, actions to “eliminate, consolidate, or downsize” USAID or “the United States official presence overseas” would not be lawful.  ', 'In short, Congress established USAID as its own agency and asserted its role in transfers of functions between USAID and State. It authorized the president to abolish or reorganize USAID for a moment in time, in accordance with the plan it authorized the then-president to provide in 1998. That reorganization occurred, with USAID’s independence retained. And there is no additional authority granted by Congress to the president to abolish USAID as an agency. ', 'As even the brief overview above demonstrates, USAID and the State Department are deeply connected agencies, and there may be legitimate policy reasons to seek to reorganize or restructure their relationship in some ways. Some of those measures could be undertaken unilaterally within the executive branch (like ensuring USAID activities hew closely to the State Department’s country strategies at posts in the field, or even transferring certain presidentially-delegated functions as noted above). At the same time, there are also compelling policy reasons for USAID to retain its own, independent leadership structure, which is the choice made by Congress, and by the presidency when given an opportunity by Congress to decide this issue in the past. ', 'If the Trump administration wishes to engage in a process with Congress to justify its view that USAID should no longer exist as its own agency, and seek legislation to effectuate that policy, it can do so. But wholesale dissolution of USAID, without an act of Congress, should not be confused with real, policy-oriented reform. It should instead be understood as another component of the Trump administration’s broadside against foreign assistance and U.S. government institutions writ large.', 'USAID has ongoing activities in more than 120 countries, with dozens of field offices around the globe. It works in the poorest countries, in countries affected by conflict, and in geopolitically strategic areas for advancing U.S. interests. Especially in light of the Trump administration’s already deeply damaging freeze on foreign aid, impacting everything from counter-trafficking and counter-narcotics assistance programs, to programs aimed at conflict prevention and stabilization, strengthening democratic governance, improving global health and food security, and more, the consequences of this action could be devastating to U.S. national security interests and to the well-being of some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.', 'Litigation and congressional oversight are certain to follow, but the question is how effective either will be in the immediate term at stopping the most damaging impacts for USAID’s programs and its employees. The details of the E.O. will shape how specific challenges to the action unfold, but expect to see at a minimum suits brought by beneficiaries of USAID programs, impoundment act challenges, and more.

Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts.', 'In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as “a carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of individual, unrelated projects.”', '“Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development program,” Kennedy said. “Long-term planning and financing — the only way to make meaningful and economical commitments.”', 'Created by executive order', 'Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from humanitarian aid programs.', 'Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International Development.', 'The agency was structured such that its administrator reported directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department policies.', 'Many successes', 'Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals, many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary.', 'USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world, and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop flourishing industrial bases.', 'In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the human population through a public health program.', 'USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths of millions of children in developing countries.', 'The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV.', 'Controversies', 'Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history, found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in the national interest.', 'Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful “pacification” programs meant to win the “hearts and minds” of the Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid programs.', 'Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts, directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the neediest.', 'In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge, none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.', 'VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.', '']"

Thousands of contractors laid off. A freeze put on billions of dollars in humanitarian assistance to other countries.', 'Over the last two weeks, President Donald Trump’s administration has made significant changes to the US agency charged with delivering humanitarian assistance overseas that has left aid organizations agonizing over whether they can continue with programs such as nutritional assistance for malnourished infants and children.', 'Then-President John F. Kennedy established the US Agency for International Development, known as USAID, during the Cold War. In the decades since, Republicans and Democrats have fought over the agency and its funding.', 'Here’s a look at USAID, its history and the changes made since Trump took office.', 'Kennedy created USAID at the height of the United States’ Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union. He wanted a more efficient way to counter Soviet influence abroad through foreign assistance and saw the State Department as frustratingly bureaucratic at doing that.', 'Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act and Kennedy set up USAID as an independent agency in 1961.', 'USAID has outlived the Soviet Union, which fell in 1991. Today, supporters of USAID argue that US assistance in countries counters Russian and Chinese influence. China has its own “belt and road” foreign aid program worldwide operating in many countries that the US also wants as partners.', 'Critics say the programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda.', 'On his first day in office on January 20, Trump implemented a 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Four days later, Peter Marocco — a returning political appointee from Trump’s first term — drafted a tougher-than-expected interpretation of that order, a move that shut down thousands of programs around the world and forced furloughs and layoffs.', 'Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since moved to keep more kinds of strictly life-saving emergency programs going during the freeze. But confusion over what programs are exempted from the Trump administration’s stop-work orders — and fear of losing US aid permanently — is still freezing aid and development work globally.', 'Dozens of senior officials have been put on leave, thousands of contractors laid off, and employees were told Monday not to enter its Washington headquarters. And USAID’s website and its account on the X platform have been taken down.', 'It’s part of a Trump administration crackdown that’s hitting across the federal government and its programs. But USAID and foreign aid are among those hit the hardest.', 'Rubio said the administration’s aim was a program-by-program review of which projects make “America safer, stronger or more prosperous.”', 'The decision to shut down US-funded programs during the 90-day review meant the US was “getting a lot more cooperation” from recipients of humanitarian, development and security assistance, Rubio said.', 'Republicans typically push to give the State Department — which provides overall foreign policy guidance to USAID — more control of its policy and funds. Democrats typically promote USAID autonomy and authority.', 'Funding for United Nations agencies, including peacekeeping, human rights and refugee agencies, have been traditional targets for Republican administrations to cut. The first Trump administration moved to reduce foreign aid spending, suspending payments to various UN agencies, including the UN Population Fund and funding to the Palestinian Authority.', 'In Trump’s first term, the US pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council and its financial obligations to that body. The US is also barred from funding the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, under a bill signed by then-President Joe Biden last March.', 'As a US senator from Florida, Rubio often called for more transparency on foreign assistance spending, but was generally supportive. In a 2017 social media post, Rubio said foreign assistance was “not charity,” that the US “must make sure it is well spent” and called foreign aid “critical to our national security.”', 'In 2023, Rubio sponsored a bill that would have required US foreign assistance agencies to include more information on what organizations were implementing the aid on the ground.', 'Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, has launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID is one of his prime targets. Musk alleges USAID funding been used to launch deadly programs and called it a “criminal organization.”', 'Sub-Saharan Africa could suffer more than any other region during the aid pause. The US gave the region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance last year. HIV patients in Africa arriving at clinics funded by an acclaimed US program that helped rein in the global AIDS epidemic of the 1980s found locked doors.', 'There are also already ramifications in Latin America. In Mexico, a busy shelter for migrants in southern Mexico has been left without a doctor. A program to provide mental health support for LGBTQ+ youth fleeing Venezuela was disbanded.', 'In Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Guatemala, so-called “Safe Mobility Offices” where migrants can apply to enter the US legally have shuttered.', 'The aid community is struggling to get the full picture: how many thousands of programs have shut down and how many thousands of workers were furloughed and laid off under the freeze?', 'In all, the U.S. spent about roughly $40 billion in foreign aid in the 2023 fiscal year, according to a report published last month by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.', 'The US is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance globally, although some other countries spend a bigger share of their budget on it. Foreign assistance overall amounts to less than 1% of the U.S. budget.', 'About 6 in 10 US adults said the US government was spending “too much” overall on foreign aid, according to a March 2023 AP-NORC poll. Asked about specific costs, roughly 7 in 10 US adults said the U.S. government was putting too much money toward assistance to other countries. About 9 in 10 Republicans and 55% of Democrats agreed that the country was overspending on foreign aid. At the time, about 6 in 10 US adults said the government was spending “too little” on domestic issues that included education, health care, infrastructure, Social Security and Medicare.', 'Polling has shown that US adults tend to overestimate the share of the federal budget that is spent on foreign aid.

A few days later it summarily dismissed the senior career leadership and then thousands of mid-level staff from USAID, essentially preventing the agency from carrying out its legislative mandated responsibilities. These decisions impact the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who manage our critical foreign assistance programs and tens of thousands of citizens in developing countries who either implement or are the beneficiaries of U.S. assistance—in many situations, depriving individuals of lifesaving medical care.', 'The damage to the U.S. reputation and image is so great that China and Russia do not have to do anything to benefit from this self-inflicted wound.', 'In addition, the administration appears to be in the process, contrary to law and without the consent of Congress, of moving USAID into the Department of State. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 established USAID as an independent agency with, what in an org chart would be represented by a dotted line, the administrator receiving foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State.', 'More recently, section 7036 of the 2024 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, states explicitly that Congress prohibits:', '… reorganization, redesign, or other plan described in subsection (b) by the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, or any other Federal department, agency, or organization funded by this Act without prior consultation by the head of such department, agency, or organization with the appropriate congressional committees. …', 'We have seen this act before, in the mid/late 1990s and again in 2017. During the Clinton Administration, Senator Jessie Helms led an effort to merge the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), and USAID into the Department of State. This occurred in the context of extensive and informed discussions within and between the two branches of government. The outcome was the 1998 law that folded ACDA and USIA into the State Department and statutorily established USAID as an independent agency.', 'In 2017, when the first Trump Administration was reported to be contemplating moving USAID into State, multiple organizations and experts reviewed alternatives of how to best organize the government to carry out foreign assistance and came up with innovative and thoughtful proposals—see here and here—which concluded that it was best to maintain a strong and independent American global development agency.', 'Why separate structures for diplomacy and development', 'Development and diplomacy are instruments designed to advance our national interests. They often pursue interlocking objectives, but have different missions, expertise, cultures, and timelines.', 'Diplomacy, development, and defense are the three-legged stool upon which the U.S. national security strategy rests. While sharing the same overall goal—advancing U.S. strategic interests in the world—their specific missions and how they function are quite different. Each requires well-trained professionals with differing expertise.', 'Diplomacy seeks closer relations with foreign governments so as to encourage alignment with U.S. foreign policy. USAID’s mission is to advance development, which requires working not just with government but also with civil society and business communities to advance the multiple nodes of economic, political, and social activity that comprise the complex nature of society. Diplomacy tends to have a short time and transactional horizon while development a medium/long-term horizon with emphasis on evaluating the achievement of results, sometimes putting the two missions at odds and limiting their ability to function well in the same organization.', 'Because USAID’s main focus is program design and oversight, most of the workforce is trained in specific sector expertise, like health, education, agriculture, and the management, compliance, and monitoring required to ensure programs are executed in a cost-effective and accountable way. USAID programs often extend throughout a country, allowing local staff and partners to have reach beyond capitals (the focus of diplomacy), which allows for deeper understanding of countries and communities and building relations at all layers of society.', 'As clearly explained in a blog by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition in 2017:', 'In practice, this means that the State Department is primarily concerned with state-to-state relations with foreign governments and short-term goals that enhance American security, while USAID often has closer ties with the broader population whose health, education, and economic prosperity are the focus of U.S. foreign assistance, with the goal of fostering long-term stability and economic growth in a country.', 'The folding of the foreign aid program into the foreign ministries of Canada and Australia has been assessed to have undercut the development function. Likewise, with the merger of the highly respected U.K. independent Department of International Development (DFID) with the Foreign Ministry into the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), the U.K. government lost expertise in program expertise and accountability.', 'As articulated by Andrew Natsios, administrator of USAID in the George W. Bush administration, in distinguishing between USAID and the Department of State:', '… beyond that they are dissimilar in every important way: The tasks they perform, what they value, their operating principles and how they carry out their work are profoundly different. ', 'Combining the two institutions would be comparable to merging Microsoft with ExxonMobil. And if this forced marriage were to occur, rather than creating “efficiencies,” it would make our development programs less effective and our emergency relief less responsive, while detrimentally politicizing our foreign aid.', 'The corporate rule is to separate disparate activities—in this case, defense, diplomacy, and development—into separate entities so as to have clear lines of authority and accountability. Following that practice, the smart and clear-cut reform actually would be to move all development programs into USAID so State can focus on its core mission of foreign policy and diplomacy.', 'There is a regular process for changing the structures of the executive branch. In the past, Congress has given administrations reorganization authority, under which the president proposes modifications to bureaucratic organizations in consultation with the Congress.', 'But until it deems otherwise, the Congress must insist that the administration uphold the law by maintaining the statutorily required independence of USAID—and that its staff be allowed to carry out the congressionally mandated responsibility to execute the foreign assistance policies and resources the Congress has authorized.', 'AUTHOR', '', 'The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.
