The Dow fell 640 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also experienced significant declines of 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively. The selloff was triggered by rising bond yields as market participants pulled back expectations for interest-rate cuts this year.', 'Higher-than-expected inflation expectations from a University of Michigan survey further exacerbated the situation. Treasury yields surged to their highest levels in over a year, with the 10-year yield rising eight basis points to 4.77%. The dollar also reached a two-year peak.', 'Traders now predict only one quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year, likely in September. The U.S. economy added the most jobs since March in December, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell.', 'Separate data indicated ongoing price pressures, with consumer inflation expectations rising to levels not seen since 2008. Neil Birrell of Premier Miton Investors commented, “Any hope of a quiet start to the year has well and truly disappeared. Good news for the economy’s strength is bad news for those hoping for interest-rate cuts, as inflation will remain the Fed’s priority.”', 'Economists at major banks have revised their forecasts for Fed rate cuts following the solid jobs data.', 'Bank of America no longer anticipates any cuts and warns of a potential hike, while Citigroup still foresees five quarter-point cuts starting in May. The focus now shifts to upcoming inflation data, with December’s consumer price index report expected on January 15, predicted to show a third consecutive month of acceleration at a rate of 2.9%. Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management remarked, “The surprisingly strong jobs report won’t make the Fed less hawkish.', 'All eyes are now on the next week’s inflation data.”', 'The market turmoil has investors bracing for more volatility as expectations for fewer rate cuts are recalibrated.

This unexpected surge in hiring caused the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, signaling a potential renewed vigor in the labor market. Throughout 2024, the labor market had been gradually cooling, but December’s figures suggest a possible turnaround.', 'Key sectors driving this job growth included health care, government, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality. The retail sector also rebounded, adding 43,000 jobs after a primarily stagnant year. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, referred to U.S. job market dynamics in 2024 as marked by “American exceptionalism.” Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, remarked, “It is hard to say anything negative about the details of this report.”', 'Financial markets responded swiftly to the strong jobs data.', 'Concerns over persistent inflation and government borrowing were amplified, causing stocks and bonds to tumble. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose by 0.17 percentage points for the week, reaching levels not seen since late 2023. This also led to an increase in the 30-year mortgage rate.', 'The S&P 500 index dropped 1.9% for the week, primarily attributed to Friday’s bond market turmoil. The dollar continued its upward trajectory, as higher U.S. interest rates attracted global investors.', 'In Europe, similar worries led to increased bond yields in Britain and Germany. The strong jobs report has also influenced expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s future actions on interest rates. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, noted that the report effectively rules out further rate cuts for the foreseeable future, possibly extending through all of 2025.', 'President Biden took this opportunity to underline his administration’s economic accomplishments, stating, “Although I inherited the worst economic crisis in decades with unemployment above 6% when I took office, we’ve had the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years with unemployment at 4.1% as I leave.”', 'The retail sector, a critical component of end-of-year job data, demonstrated its seasonal hiring vitality. Retailers succeeded in hiring 43,400 workers in December, a sharp rise from the 29,000 jobs lost in November. This hiring spree was fueled by demand in clothing, shoes, jewelry, general merchandise, and health and personal care, reflecting the sector’s overall health during the holiday season.', 'In summary, the surprisingly strong job growth in December 2024 has ignited optimism for the U.S. economy’s strength and resilience as it heads into the new year, leaving economists and analysts cautiously hopeful for sustained recovery and growth.', 'KillerStartups is the leading publication dedicated to startup founders and early-stage companies.', '© 2025 All Rights Reserved.']"

We wonder if the fresh data will be noticed, since uncertainty is a mile high.', 'Where is the Fed in all this? It should be hiding under a rock. Yesterday the Atlanta Fed issued another revision to Q1 GDP, a stunning 3.9% from 2.9% only the day before.  Not that the Fed funds bettors heed the Atlanta Fed, but the probability is not rate cut until June. Even so, the probability of no cut in June rose to 37.9% from 26.1% a week ago.

Realistically, Trump is trading Taiwan for something. We just don’t know yet what it is.', 'The bond market has good economists and they pretty much all say tariffs are not temporary, tariffs are inflationary, and upheaval and uncertainty call for a rise in yields to include a heftier term premium. So far this has not exploded yields but it’s early days—just over two weeks, in fact. So while you can’t fight the tape, you can expect a rising differential plus risk aversion to feed the dollar. It won’t be consistent—no straight lines—and it won’t be pretty, but we can find no reasons to imagine other currencies “should” change trend direction. The exception is the Swiss franc, the ultimate safe-haven, and somewhat weirdly, the UK pound.', 'Tidbit: Elon Musk, not elected and not FBI-vetted, is closing down foreign aid, the Education Dept, the Small Business Administration and heaven only knows what else. He is accountable to only one person, Trump. This is not what the Constitution and over 200 years of practice and policy have called for. The Dems are shell-shocked and spineless, even though the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the Executive. Secretary of State Rubio is stepping in on behalf of USAid. Trump made a somewhat offhand remark about reining in Musk.', ""Musk having seized the Treasury payment system is confusing. This could happen only because the TreasSec allowed it. We smell impeachment. Musk is being sued by private organizations who argue that it’s a privacy violation to give this “efficiency expert” access to peoples' tax refunds, veterans' benefits and disability checks. A brave Senator wrote a sedate letter to the TreasSec saying “I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems.” Those include also Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, and payments to government contractors including those that compete directly with Musk’s own companies.” "", 'Do you really want this guy to have your Social Security number and net income?', 'The Supreme Court started the distrust of government among the people (with Bush v.

Despite interest rates near their highest in decades for credit cards, mortgages, and other loans, layoffs have remained scarce and consumers have continued to ramp up their spending.\n\nOnly 207,000 people filed for jobless claims last week, according to the Department of Labor, a figure similar to pre-pandemic levels and not indicating any serious weakness in the labor market.\n3\nStill, employers have pulled back on job openings dramatically since 2022, leaving the labor market in an uneasy ""low hiring, low firing"" limbo that some economists see as a potential precursor to increasing layoffs down the road.', ""Economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, for example, predict the unemployment rate will rise throughout the year as high interest rates continue to bite and Donald Trump's administration pares back the size of the federal government, which employs about 2% of all workers in the country.\n\nA wild card in the employment picture is Trump's economic policies.

Every sector in the S&P rose, some more than others, but they all rose.', 'By the end of the day - The Dow gained 168 pts or 0.4%, the S&P added 25 pts or 0.5%, the Nasdaq advanced by 45 pts or 0.25%, the Russell added 22 pts or 1%, the Transports gave back 146 pts or 0.9%, the Equal Weight S&P added 90 pts or 1.3% while the Mag 7 closed unchanged on the day. Now the outperformance of the Equal Weight S&P once again suggests that the market rally is broadening out……and that is a good thing for investors.', 'Utilities ruled the day, rising 2.2% - now remember when utilities were the sleepy sector of the market? They are great dividend payers, and they offer stability to your portfolio, and they ARE boring? Well, boring no more! Utilities have risen nearly 26% over the past 12 months and are up another 3.5% this month…. much of that driven by all the excitement around their role in powering the demand created by AI boom…. And that isn’t going away anytime soon.', 'But yesterday’s move in utilities can also be tied to the idea that rates are going lower…lower rates make utility divvies more attractive. Real Estate came in at second place – adding 1.3% (again that’s a lower rate story), Healthcare and Industrials up 1.1%. Financials, Consumer Staples & Consumer Discretionary jumped by 1%, Basic Materials went up 0.95%, Energy gained 0.4%, with Tech gaining 0.2% and Communications adding 0.1%.', 'The SMIDS (represented by the Russell) which are ‘economically sensitive’ outperformed and that suggests that while investors are feeling good about the economy, lower rates are supportive of this sector and that supports the outperformance. The IWM (iShares Russell 2000) rose 1%, (now up 3.5% ytd) while the IJT (iShares small cap 600 growth names) added 1.1%. (now up 4.6% ytd).', 'Treasuries rose just a bit – the TLT + 0.35% and the TLH gaining 0.4% but that did little to change yields…. The 2 yr remains at 4.2% while the 10 yr is yielding 4.52%.', 'Oil – which had traded off and tested trendline support ($72.12) three times this week – ended the day up 50 cts at $73.12. They are crediting the tariff threat on both Mexico and Canada this Saturday as the reason for the move higher. In the end – Tariffs can disrupt supply chains and create uncertainty, but the threats on oil producing nations – (think Mexico and Canada) could cause them to retaliate by reducing oil exports or cutting production which will tighten supplies and send prices higher. Or you can argue that oil traders are buying oil to hedge against perceived inflation or the economic uncertainty that some think will be triggered by the disputes. I think it was all of that plus the weaker dollar. In any event – It feels like it wants to test a bit higher for now…. My gut says a test of the October high of $76 is not out of the question.', 'Gold -busted out! Rocketing higher…. - Remember, yesterday morning I said that ‘the chart is now suggesting a move to the November high of $2845’ – well guess what sports fans? It closed at $2850.20 – BAM! We are now in NEW high territory – there is nothing above us except air…..a trendline drawn from the highs of May connecting to the high of November and out – suggests a $3000 price target….something that both Goldman and BankAmerica suggested was a possibility in 2025….Now, don’t get so excited just yet…..while the breakout is a positive – we have to see how it acts in the next couple of sessions…Short term support is $2775. This morning gold is trading down $6 at $2844,', 'After the bell, the news that everyone was waiting for hit the tape….AAPL’s earnings…..EPS $2.40 (beat), Revenues $124.3 billion (beat), Mac Revenues $8.99 billion (beat), iPad Revenue $8.09 billion (beat), Services Revenue $26.34 billion (beat), Gross Margins 46.9% (beat) – yet the stock traded off nearly 2% in after-hours trading.', 'Why? Because China sales were down 11%! Are you joking? It’s ludicrous that anyone could find a reason to sell AAPL on that report – but my gut says it’s the momo guys that bought it up 9% in the last week trying to ‘lock in those short-term profits’ –', 'Now this morning – cooler heads are prevailing…. Why? Because the China story was not an unknown, the estimates were for sales to be down 18% yet they were only down 11% - so that too is a BEAT! At 6 am – AAPL is up $8 or 3.5% trading at $245! Love it. (And the fact that they make $124 Billion every 3 months is enough for me!).', 'This morning- US futures are UP…. Dow futures + 160 pts, S&P’s up 25, Nasdaq + 160 while the Russell is flat. The markets are bracing for the tariffs about to be imposed on Mexico and Canada. Will they be negative or not?', 'Eco data today includes the FED’s favored inflation gauge – the PCE report and it is expected to be up 0.3% m/m and 2.6% y/y on the top line and both of those reads would be HIGHER than last month. Core PCE of +0.2% m/m and +2.8% y/y – which would be in line with last month. So, it’s a toss-up!', 'European markets are all higher…. The ECB did cut rates by 25 bps yesterday – that was expected, taking their rates down to 2.75% - making this the 5th time since June. ECB President Christine Lagarde warning of weakness in the Eurozone resulted in stagnation in the 4th qtr. only confirms the bets that the ECB will continue to slash rates throughout the year. Markets across the zone are all up between 0.2% - 0.5%.', 'The S&P closed at 6071 up 31 pts – taking back the 30 pts it lost on Wednesday. We’re churning down 30 then up 30, down 100 then up 100 - ….and my sense is that we will continue to churn and that’s good - We need to repair the damage done on Monday before moving significantly higher.', 'I am still in the camp that you need not chase anything…. You can find opportunities and value in plenty of places. As of today – this is how the sectors are lining up this year.', 'Financials and Healthcare up 7%, Basic Materials +6%, Communications and Energy +5.25%, Consumer Discretionary + 4%, Utilities +3.5%, Real Estate +2%, Consumer Staples + 1.5%, Industrials +1.1% with Tech the only loser – down 0.1%.', 'Down the list – Disruptive Tech – ARKK +11%, Semi’s +1.5%, Value +3.5%, Growth up 3%, Aerospace and Defense +5%, Exploration& Production +3.8%, Big Pharma + 3.8%, Homebuilders +6%, Retail +2.5%, Airlines + 4%, SMIDS +4% and the list goes on…. Even bonds are up – the TLT + 1.15% and the TLH + 1.1%.', 'Diversification is key as you get older…. (Younger investors can take more risks). Long-term investors should take advantage of any weakness in high-quality names if they come under pressure for no reason other than market cycles. A change in the thesis results in a change in the analysis.', 'Nothing complicated, simple to make and then let it cook.', 'For this you need a piece of chuck roast (size depends on how many people), Dijon mustard, steak seasoning, 1 large yellow onion, chopped carrots and fresh rosemary.', 'Preheat your oven to 325 degrees.', 'Now take the veggies and chop them up. Place in the bottom of a Dutch oven. Season you roast with steak seasoning. Then generously dress it with the Dijon mustard –', 'Cover and place in the oven – cooking 1 hour/lb. + 30 mins. 3 lbs. = 3 1/2 hrs. When done – remove and shred with 2 forks – mix with the veggies and serve it family style with whipped mashed potatoes or whipped sweet potatoes.', 'I make a bed of sweet potatoes and then place the shredded meat on top.', '', 'General Disclosures', 'Information and commentary provided by ButcherJoseph Asset Management, LLC (“BJAM”), are opinions and should not be construed as facts.
