Review: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition,https://www.wired.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-fe-review/,"['', '8/10', 'NVIDIA’S NEWEST 50 Series GPUs are slowly trickling out, and as usual, the very top-end RTX 5090 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the graphics card that everyone is talking about. It boasts extreme 4K gaming, the latest in AI-powered gaming enhancements, and a power draw to match.', ""I can’t blame you for not wanting to spend $2,000 on a GPU; that’s enough to build a midrange gaming PC on its own. At just $1,000 for the RTX 5080 Founders Edition, this still-expensive step-down card will be the model that more people seriously consider, even if it's still a splurge. It's a better choice from a performance perspective, meeting people where they already are in terms of monitor resolution, game choice, and existing power supplies."", ""But how does it fare against the more expensive card, and how does it handle some of the more popular and evergreen games? Well enough to my eyes. If you're building your next high-end gaming PC and are looking for a high-end video card to match, this might be exactly what you're looking for—if you can find one for sale."", 'THE FORM FACTOR of the RTX 5080 is identical to its more powerful counterpart, with a true two slot design that should fit in most cases very comfortably. I really appreciate the size reduction overall, and I hope AIC cards follow suit.', 'Where the RTX 5090 draws an immense 575 watts, the 5080 only asks for 360 watts with the same new power connector. Like the RTX 5090 FE, the RTX 5080 includes an adapter, and I imagine most partner cards will as well.', 'That means a lower overall system power requirement, with Nvidia recommending just 850 watts for the Founders Edition. I expect this will be an easier requirement for existing rigs to meet without needing to buy a new 1,000-watt or higher PSU.', 'Nvidia introduced a new version of its AI-powered enhancement tools for the RTX 50 Series. These notably add support for multi-frame generation, which uses AI to generate up to three frames between. If you’re interested in learning more about the effects of using this tech on image quality, make sure to check out the RTX 5090 review.', 'The short version is that multi-frame generation can produce minor artifacts, particularly in areas where two objects at different depths overlap, such as looking through a fence. These are hard to spot across a whole screen though, and the higher frame rate makes the gaming experience much smoother, so the frames are onscreen less time.', 'I’ll start by checking out performance in Cyberpunk 2077, one of the more demanding games that currently supports multi-frame generation.', 'Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080', 'RATING: 8/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED', 'While it isn’t perfect, I’m impressed that the RTX 5080 is able to maintain a relatively smooth 60 frames per second while running at 4K, even without having to turn on multi-frame generation. I’m not averse to using the feature, as it does a great job providing extra smoothness with minimal artifacts, but I’d rather just use the card’s natural horsepower when possible.', ""I'm just using ray tracing here, with everything on the highest setting, but Cyberpunk 2077 has an additional setting for path tracing that’s even more demanding."", 'Unsurprisingly, the RTX 5080 has trouble keeping up with path tracing, the most demanding and graphically intensive form of ray tracing. Fortunately, you can break the 60-fps mark by just turning on a single AI-generated frame, which should have a minimal effect on the overall visual quality. I do appreciate the balance here of fine-tuning settings to get close, or turning on frame generation for a big jump in FPS, then comparing the outcomes on a per-game basis.', 'Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080', 'RATING: 8/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED', 'The RTX 5090 takes a big lead over the RTX 5080 here, but whether that extra performance is worth it will depend on your existing rig. The RTX 5090 needs a 1,000-watt or higher PSU, and it really benefits from a high-refresh 4K or 1440p screen. If those don’t describe you, know that there are additional costs associated with the highest-end card.', 'Where the RTX 5090 review focused on the top end of performance, I want to zoom in here on games that are less graphically demanding but more commonly played. I cranked the graphics up to Ultra wherever I could, because that’s just what you do with a new GPU. For this first round I used native resolution, but I’ll discuss supersampling as well.', 'These are the kind of numbers I’m excited to see as a daily gamer. These games are meat and potatoes for a lot of folks, and especially at 1440p or lower, you won’t need to tweak much to get them running smoothly.', 'If you’re playing at 1080p and 120 Hz or lower, I recommend supersampling, which lets you render games at 4K and then display them at your monitor’s native resolution. Running Helldivers 2 at 1080p, for example, only used a portion of the GPU’s power. While using Ultra Super-Sampling, the frame rate dropped, but the image quality was much better, and the GPU was running at its full potential.', 'While it may run on mobile phones, the PC version of Minecraft can still demand a lot from your GPU, particularly with the updated ray-tracing models. If you can run it smoothly, it gives the game an incredible boost from what you’re used to, letting light shine through windows and bounce off different textured surfaces.', 'In a forum post early in the morning on January 28, just two days before launch, Nvidia warned buyers of limited availability for the 50 Series cards.', '“We expect significant demand for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 and believe stock-outs may happen. Nvidia & our partners are shipping more stock to retail every day to help get GPUs into the hands of gamers.”', 'Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080', 'RATING: 8/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED', 'If previous releases are any indication, the Founders Editions may be even harder to come by than their AIC counterparts. I hoped they might be more plentiful this time around, but the forum warning doesn’t help. If you want a Founders Edition of either card, I’d make sure to bookmark the purchase pages on multiple retailers and check often for restocks.', 'In the RTX 5090 review, I mentioned that the card felt more like a showpiece, or a demonstration model for the new generation’s capabilities. I expect to see more RTX 5080s out in the world, and not just because it’s half the price. Over 50 percent of users in the Steam Hardware Survey reported using a 1080p display as their main screen, and less than 5 percent of PC gamers in the study had a 4K monitor.', 'For a lot of people, having an RTX 5090 would be like buying a Lamborghini when the speed limit is 15 MPH. Meanwhile, the RTX 5080 clobbered basically every commonly played game I threw at it, and its lower power consumption makes it a much easier upgrade path for more people.', 'The biggest problem may just be getting your hands on one, which is a real shame. The RTX 5080 is the card in the 50 Series that I think will appeal to most people, balancing performance, power requirements, and price. The Founders Edition is a premium example too, with a compact form factor and understated styling.', 'Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080', 'RATING: 8/10', 'If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

"PNY RTX 5080 OC review: ""this GPU is for the next-gen overclockers""",https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/desktop-pc/pny-rtx-5080-oc-review/,"['When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'The PNY RTX 5080 OC takes Nvidia’s 4K graphics card up a notch with a factory overclock and a triple fan cooling setup, but the three-slot design is a bit unwieldy compared to the Founders Edition. It also has access to the exact same DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame generation abilities that make the vanilla card worth buying, and its higher boost clock could come in handy for PC games without AI tricks.', 'Factory overclock', 'Triple fan cooling', 'Runs pretty quiet', 'Excellent DLSS 4 abilities', 'Pretty hefty compared to Founders Edition', 'Higher price', 'Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy.', 'Yes, I only just shared my Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review with all you high-frame rate thrill seekers, but I’ve also been testing the PNY RTX 5080 OC version. While many of you will be looking to grab the Founders Edition model, chances are you’ll end up checking out various factory-overclocked models. While I’d naturally recommend PNY’s take on the 80-class to overclocking enthusiasts first, cards like this could end up being the best option for players with an aversion to AI.', 'That’s not to say I’d avoid using DLSS 4 on the PNY RTX 5080 OC. Ditching the AI tools will simply result in you messing around with settings to boost fps when playing at 4K. However, not every game benefits from the green team’s Frame Generation magic, and in the instances where you’re relying on native performance, overclocked GPUs can pull harder punches in the best graphics card ring.', 'Even though the PNY RTX 5080’s factory overclock ultimately only inches a few frames higher than the Founders Edition, having the freedom to boost clock speeds further can make all the difference. That said, I do have reservations about how useful overclocking is in relation to AI-boosted performance, not to mention the extra cooling required comes with size caveats.', '', 'Just like the Founders Edition model, the PNY RTX 5080 OC is packing a Blackwell GB203 armed with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 tensor cores, and 84 ray tracing cores. The uplift compared to the RTX 4080 Super is admittedly modest, and that does mean native performance is closer to the Lovelace model than some players may have expected. Perhaps that’s more a commentary on the fact the last generation already packed an unprecedented punch, but new DLSS abilities ultimately change that narrative.', 'Of course, when it comes to models like the PNY RTX 5080 OC specifically, the conversation ends up revolving around clock speeds. This version comes with a factory overclock that ramps up its boost clock from 2,617 MHz to 2,780 MHz, which theoretically should help you boost fps a bit further compared to the Founders Edition or other vanilla cards. That’s certainly the case when it comes to native performance, but I’ll get onto how that mixes with new Frame Generation tricks when chatting performance.', 'Virtually everything else specs-wise about the PNY RTX 5080 OC lines up with the Founders Edition, including its 16GB GDDR7 VRAM, 360W TDP, and 256-bit memory bus. Just in case it isn’t clear, custom versions like this are meant to be slightly souped-up options rather than a completely different model, and while there are performance benefits to using a card designed for overclocking, your out-of-the-box results shouldn’t be worlds apart from other models.', '', 'Just when I thought we were done with huge graphics cards, the PNY RTX 5080 came along and shattered my two-slot dreams. That’s not to say I expected this factory overclock card to match the Founders Edition on slenderness, but I don’t think I was quite expecting something the same size as many custom GeForce RTX 4090 cards from a few years ago. Simply put, this card is one of the largest versions you’ll find this generation, and that might be a good or a bad thing depending on your PC case space.', 'Keep in mind that the PNY RTX 5080 is a triple fan graphics card, and that naturally makes it more of a chonk. Enhanced cooling is pretty much vital when it comes to overclocked GPUs, not to mention it’ll suit some of you who’ve always used a card with this kind of cooling setup. While some of you will be quite happy to whack a new component into your rig regardless of its design, some systems are laid out with a three-fan shroud in mind, and sticking with that means airflow should remain the same.', 'As for aesthetics, the PNY RTX 5080 keeps things pretty corporate with no RGB and a black shroud highlighted by logo text. Despite its enormous stature, this card should blend in with your existing system pretty well, and even the little GPU support bracket/screwdriver hybrid included with the package is fairly inconspicuous. Just keep in mind that if you’re upgrading from something older than Nvidia’s 30-series, the size of this GeForce card could catch you off guard and interfere with your PCIe component space.', 'In line with every Nvidia graphics card from the last generation, the PNY RTX 5080 uses a 12-pin power connector. Unlike the Founders Edition, the socket isn’t angled, but it is recessed within the shroud a little to combat any bulky cabling issues preventing your case door from closing. The design choice means extruding wires will partially occupy the same footprint as the GPU itself, and it’s a better solution than simply having them aggressively extend outwards from the card. That said, I did find it tricky to get my fat thumbs around the dongle to remove it, which feels like it could spark future frustration if the need to remove it crops up.', 'Both the RTX 5080 and its flagship RTX 5090 rely on Nvidia’s new DLSS 4 as a standout feature. The PNY RTX 5080 is no different in that it uses revamped versions of AI Super Sampling and Multi-Frame Generation alongside enhanced ray tracing techniques to boost performance and fidelity. Access to those tricks is dependent on whether developers add support, but with many PC games are releasing with the settings built-in by default, playing with AI enhancements switched on is slowly becoming a standard.', 'That said, overclocked cards like the PNY RTX 5080 are designed to give you ways to boost fps without AI shackles. You won’t even have to immediately play around with boost clock speeds yourself seeing as this model comes with that aforementioned factory overclock, but you’ll then be able to tweak things further using PNY’s Velocity X software. The app itself is fairly straightforward and keeps things simple with small menus for clock speed sliders, fan temperature curve customization, and pre-set buttons. It’s pretty much the same app that’s been around since the RTX 3090 but still offers a simple way to experiment with overclocking while striking a balance between frame rate boosts and thermals.', 'Speaking of software, the PNY RTX 5080 also uses the new Nvidia App as a base station for driver settings and access to the GPU’s other features. You’ll be able to access many of the options previously concealed within the GPU marker’s older Control Panel hub, optimize game settings in a central place, and tap into creative tools like Nvidia Broadcast for streaming. It’s certainly an improvement over the old Nvidia GeForce Experience app, and while it’s compatible with GPUs outside of the 50-series, it’ll still help you better access your expensive new GPU’s tricks.', '', 'Pitting the PNY RTX 5080 against the Founders Edition GPU feels less like a boxing match and more like shadowboxing. That’s hardly surprising since we’re effectively talking about the same graphics card, only the PNY version is wearing a thicker set of armor and has perhaps chugged five espressos before swinging into action. What I’m saying is that I did see slightly higher frame rates thanks to the factory overclock in some instances during testing, but I otherwise felt like I was using the same graphics card.', 'Let’s chat native performance first, as the PNY RTX 5080 did inch higher than the Founders Edition in Cyberpunk 2077, pulling off a 74fps average with 4K ultra settings enabled. Sure, a 3fps difference isn’t anything to get that excited about, but it does prove that even slightly boosted clock speeds can help claw back some frames. Hitman 3 ended up in the same boat, hitting 166fps rather than 164fps at base clock speeds.', 'Hardly exciting, right? Well, keep in mind this is out-of-the-box performance, so overclocking the card further could help you inch ever higher up the frame rate ladder. What I will say is that in Total War: Warhammer 3, I was able to squeeze 91fps at 4K out of the card compared to 87fps using the stock card. That’s around 4.6% of an increase, and if that sort of benefit applies to future games hovering around 60fps, that could come in clutch.', 'If I’ve learned one thing from benchmarking the PNY RTX 5080 and Founders Edition in the same week, it’s that boost clock increases become less valuable with DLSS 4 enabled. That makes sense seeing as Multi-Frame Generation will take the GPU’s generated visuals and effectively fill in the gaps, meaning the minor frame gains are mixed in with AI-generated fps.', 'Don’t get me wrong, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The fact we’re at a stage where playing around with settings and tweaking clock speeds to churn out a few extra frames is pretty nice. If you find that sort of thing fun, you’ll likely disagree, but I’d honestly take being able to ramp up fps from 66fps to 309fps in Dragon Age: The Veilguard using DLSS 4 than sinking time into tweaking individual settings to inch a few frames higher.', 'Timespy: 32,416\nFirestrike: 53,332', 'I’m not saying everyone should start using DLSS 4 without question, and I’ll be looking closely at the pros and cons of this frankly revolutionary tech over the next few months. What I will say is that Nvidia is pretty on the ball with coming up with solutions for its own problems, implementing a new Transformer AI model to help combat artifacts and any shenanigans caused by upscaling. As I already touched on in my Founders Edition rundown, I wasn’t able to sniff out many visual hiccups playing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and I’m already seeing an impressive improvement compared to the early days of DLSS 2 and original techniques.', 'It’s also worth noting that in some scenarios, latency could become a bit of an issue, even if tools like Nvidia Reflex seem to be offsetting any of those caveats at the moment. Put it this way, I’ve spent a nice chunk of time this week playing Marvel Rivals at 4K with Multi-Frame Generation switched on and didn’t catch onto any delayed inputs, even though I managed to kick things up from 70fps to 312fps.', 'Frame rates aside, I was admittedly more interested in the PNY RTX 5080’s cooling abilities and whether opting for a massive tri-cooler shroud is beneficial. The answer is a resounding yes, as the highest temperature I managed to get out of this card was around 64°C. I’m not saying that puts the Founders Edition’s efforts to shame, as you’re still talking about results sitting mostly in the sixties. But, the fact that I got away with playing Cyberpunk 2077 in RT Overdrive mode while the card happily burred away at sometimes 59°C is mighty impressive.', 'Before you ask, no, the PNY RTX 5080 doesn’t make a racket to achieve those temperatures. The cooling system ended up providing a similar gentle hum to Nvidia’s own design, but your mileage may vary based on your choice of case and setup. Just know that you aren’t going to hear the card’s cooling efforts under normal circumstances, and it helps justify the model’s egregious size.', '', 'Just like the Founders Edition, the PNY RTX 5080 OC pulls off phenomenal 4K frame rates using DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation. If you do opt for this factory overclocked card, you will also see further games in native performance, which could please some of you out there with an aversion to AI tools. The fact it’s larger than Nvidia’s stock card is a drawback worth keeping in mind, but it does come with noticeable cooling benefits that will help make further boost clock tweaks more of a reality.', 'Those of you looking to buy an RTX 5080 might not have a choice between a vanilla card and something like the PNY RTX 5080 OC. If that ends up being the case for you specifically, just know that PNY’s model is a custom option I can comfortably recommend despite its size and higher MSRP. Ultimately, an overclocked card like this is going to be that bit more futureproof compared to a model with limited room for boosts, so you can attribute any extra investment to that.', ""Over the course of a week, I tested the PNY RTX 5080 OC side by side with the Founders Edition model while comparing both graphics cards in terms of design and performance, During that time, I used a set collection of benchmark games including Cyberpunk 2077, Hitman 3, Total War: Warhammer 3, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Marvel Rivals and collated average frame rates for both cards. In turn, this enabled me to directly compare the overclocked PNY card to Nvidia's Founders Edition to check for performance benefits."", 'For more on how we test graphics cards and other components, take a look at our full GamesRadar+ Hardware policy.', 'Looking to pick up a next-gen GPU? Check out where to buy the RTX 5090 and where to buy the RTX 5070.

Don’t get me wrong, I kickstarted my relationship with technology by jamming a Hot Wheels double-decker bus into my parent’s VCR, but we all have to start somewhere.

And we’re not even talking about third-party takes on these cards, some of which have prices rising above $3,000.', 'And just like clockwork, the scalpers have stepped in to snap up every last card and resell them on eBay for even more outrageous prices, because what’s a GPU launch without a healthy dose of pain and scarcity? Yet this time, the scammers have a new trick up their sleeves, and you need to make sure you don’t fall for it.', 'During the Covid pandemic, GPUs were hard to find as the global supply chain shut down. Scalpers and scammers openly and proudly listed their ill-gotten goods for sky-high prices without even bothering to excuse their behavior. As you’d expect, people weren’t happy.', 'This time, the scalpers have a new tactic, and it seems designed to generate understanding among casual observers, perhaps even sympathy. Indeed, browse eBay today and you’ll likely find a plethora of listings with some variation on the following title: “Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 32GB (read the description).”', 'And why must you read the description?

I reckon not.', 'The first and most obvious warning sign of these listings is right there in the title. If any listing headline contains the words “read the description,” it suggests that something is not quite as it should be, and that you can’t take the product description at its word.

This seems to be an attempt to evade eBay’s automated scam filters and detection systems, and it’s something you’ll regularly find among the garbage in your email spam folder. If a seller has taken the time to add strange and unusual fonts, something shady could well be going on.', 'As well as that, each of these fake graphics card sellers has spent time carefully building their reputation on eBay to reassure bidders that they’re legit.

The more sophisticated GPU scammers will take more time, such as the one that sold trading cards so their feedback was full of buyers commending them on their “great cards.”', 'A few years ago, I fell victim to a GPU scam on eBay. I wanted to buy an Nvidia GTX 980 Ti (I’m showing my age here) and found one listed close to MSRP. The seller had 100% positive feedback, (admittedly from a relatively low number of reviews — another red flag), so I felt comfortable dealing with them. In the end, I paid for a GPU that never arrived, and it took me months of wrangling with eBay to finally get my money back. It was so difficult that I almost gave up.', 'You see all of these hallmarks in today’s fake “anti-bot” listings. If you come across any of these warning signs, be extremely cautious.

That’d put us in the middle of March before the graphics card was available again (perhaps only briefly).', 'We shouldn’t get carried away with the timeframes from just one retailer, of course, and the worst-case scenarios presented by OCUK – but this does, of course, broadly reflect everything we’re seeing right now. And the general accusation of a ‘paper launch’ being leveled at Nvidia, meaning a launch with no real quantity of stock behind it (in the face of major demand).', 'Unless we do get a quick recovery for RTX 5080 stock that runs against OCUK’s expectations – we don’t expect the RTX 5090 to be back on shelves quickly by any means, especially given that its Blackwell chip (GB202) is more profitable in AI graphics cards, not gaming products – a lot of hope lies with the incoming RTX 5070.', 'Nvidia’s RTX 5070 vanilla version uses a different GB205 chip – the RTX 5070 Ti is built with GB203 (a rumor that’s now confirmed), also the engine of the RTX 5080 – and so we can hope that Nvidia has more of a depth to its GB205 production, especially as the RTX 5070 is coming a bit later. (If rumors are right, perhaps at the end of February – there’s even talk of a delay to March, which wouldn’t be a positive development, of course).', 'All in all, though, the situation looks distinctly rocky with Blackwell stock for now, and AMD has a chance to fully capitalize on this by building up good levels of RDNA 4 supply at retail for the launch of its RX 9070 models in March, to take on Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics cards. This is a clear opportunity for Team Red in the mid-range bracket of the GPU market, although AMD has had its own missteps with the RDNA 4 launch, it must be said.', 'Those looking for an Nvidia Blackwell graphics card should keep an eye on our guides on where to buy an RTX 5090 and an RTX 5080 respectively, where we’ll keep you up to date should we spot stock coming back in at big retailers.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: performance worthy of the name?,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review,"[""It's slower than RTX 4090/5090 - but offers a lot more value."", ""If Nvidia's RTX 5090 was tricky to review, its 80-class offering is even more challenging. PC users have grown used to this tier of card outperforming the outgoing flagship, but let's be clear - RTX 5080 is a slower card than the RTX 4090 while the new RTX 5090 is much, much faster. In many ways, you can think of the new 5080 as a 4080 Super Super. There's a small but appreciated bump to performance against its predecessor - around 13 percent in my testing - and it's delivered for the same price. And of course, you get the latest DLSS 4 feature set, including multi frame generation, which we'll be looking at in this review. So, this is the best GPU you can buy at its price-point - but it's also the only new GPU available at this price-point."", ""Today, we're reviewing the Founders Edition card, which is another winner from Nvidia. Up against the RTX 4080 and RTX 4080 Super, the industrial design is simply fantastic. The massive, hulking design from the last generation gives way to a new 80-class product that once again uses the 90-class cooler. That means you get a two-slot, relatively small graphics. Power is supplied by the now standard (for Nvidia) 12VHPWR socket on the top, while video outputs consist of an HDMI 2.1 port along with three DisplayPort 2.1s. I had no issues at all with noise here and similar to the RTX 5090, I loved the corrugated cardboard packaging."", ""Priced at $999/£979 - for the Founders model at least - I can't help but feel that once again Nvidia has supplied the best model available at the lowest price and based on the rumours surrounding this launch (along with the extremely expensive third-party 5090s), I do have worries that the actual cost of investment in RTX 5080 may well up higher. One of the key elements that makes this product palatable is its pricing: better value than RTX 4090 and RTX 5090 in terms of 'monetary unit per frame' and faster/more feature-rich than RTX 4080 Super for the same price. Adding on a couple of hundred pounds or dollars brings us back into the dark days of 2022, where the RTX 4080 arrived at an unbelievable $1199/£1189."", ""Looking at specs, it's easy to see why there is such a chasm in capabilities between RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. It's a far cry from the RTX 30-series Ampere line, with the 3080 and 3090 were based off the same processor. In architectural terms, you can almost think of the 5080 processor as one-half of the 5090's. The 512-bit interface becomes 256-bit (though 5080 gets slightly faster GDDR7) and there's slightly fewer than half the CUDA cores. At 360W, the 5080 peaks at around 63 percent of the flagship's monstrous 575W requirement. Thankfully, utilisation does not scale in a linear manner with specs, so the gaming performance gap between them closes up."", ""What the table doesn't show you is how close RTX 4080 Super and RTX 5080 are - the core spec points there are very, very similar. The size of the chip is virtually identical. RTX 5080 has 10,752 CUDA cores against 4080 Super's 10,240. Where there are variations it comes down to power and bandwidth. RTX 5080 moves up to 360W vs the 4080 Super's 320W. The use of GDDR7 for 960GB/s of bandwidth means there's a 30 percent uplift there compared to the outgoing card, so we should see higher than average performance uplifts on games that benefit from higher memory bandwidth. Comparisons against 4090 are also interesting - far fewer CUDA cores (10,752 vs 16,384), but slightly higher clocks and only a small reduction in bandwidth, despite the memory interface reduction. RTX 4090 will obviously be faster, but the variation in results does prove intriguing."", ""For all of our results, we're using a top-end system based around the fastest gaming CPU, the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, to shift the burden to the graphics card as much as possible. We also have 32GB of Corsair DDR5-6000 CL30 memory, a high-end Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Hero motherboard and a 1000W Corsair PSU."", ""With all that said, let's get into the benchmarks."", 'Find out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.', 'Eurogamer is better when you sign in', 'Join our community of gamers and get access to personalised reading recommendations and much more!', ""Eurogamer.net is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis. © 2025 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: the new 4K graphics card to go for,https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review,"['Ohhh, it gets by, with a little help, from frame gen', 'Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.', 'It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.', 'It’s certainly a more sensible buy than the RTX 5090 for high-rez gamesplaying. A Founders Edition, like the one I’m testing here, will set you back £979 / $999, or roughly half the price of the next (and final) RTX 50 model in the pile. Plus, while it has the same 16GB of 256-bit VRAM as the 4080 and 4080 Super, that’s still enough for all the AAA industry’s biggest resource-eaters, and it’s been upgraded to GDDR7 for a stretch of extra bandwidth. Get the Founders Edition and you’ll also bag yourself the same lovely metallic design and effective dual-fan cooler that the RTX 5090 FE has, running even colder here thanks to the RTX 4080’s lower power needs.', ""It's still a thirsty creature, to be sure: Nvidia reckon you’ll need at least an 850W PSU to run it, and max usage is rated at a toasty 360W. Unlike on the RTX 5090 FE, however, I didn’t record the RTX 5080 FE actually hitting its limit, with it peaking at 322W while running games. Its GPU temperature high of 64°c was a good nine degrees cooler the 5090 as well. See? Sensible. Ish."", 'The biggest and scariest of mainstream monitor resolutions doesn’t faze the RTX 5080 a jot, even in the more recent tough runners. The RTX 5090 is faster still, though the RTX 5080 is always able to match a good majority of its sibling’s frames-per-second output for half the cash. It’s also a juicy upgrade over the RTX 30 series’ elite – encouraging, if you’re upgrading from an older card – and it even comes somewhat close to the RTX 4090, which at the time of writing is still going for upwards of £1300 in the secondhand market.', 'Keen bar chart fans may recall that the RTX 4080 did beat the RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti outright, so it’s a bit of a backwards shuffle for the RTX 5080 to not completely outpace the previous generation’s top dog in turn. I’m not sure that’s a particularly huge deal, outside of maintaining conventions, though I do wish the RTX 5080 gave more of a speed boost to rasterised, native-rez games over the RTX 4080 Super.', 'To look at this, we must – temporarily but with apologies – return to the old RPS test rig and its Core i5-11600K, which is the only one I have RTX 4080 Super results for. Cyberpunk 2077 sees a decent bump, rising from 51fps (with Ultra settings) on the 4080 Super to 71fps on the 5080, though the newest GPU’s 81fps in F1 22 (on Ultra High) is an uptick of just 12fps. Metro Exodus barely improved either, averaging 99fps on the 4080 Super and 106fps on the 5080.', 'What none of these RTX 40 series cards have, however, is a full suite of DLSS 4 framerate-massaging tools. While one of my personal favourites among these – the new Transformer model option for upscaling, which enhances overall image quality in exchange for a smaller performance boost – is available to older RTX models, the headlining multi Frame Generation (MFG) is exclusive to the RTX 50 series. And this actually can nudge the RTX 5080 past the RTX 4090, at least in terms of purely visible smoothness.', 'If you’re unfamiliar, MFG takes the AI frame generation of DLSS 3 and can throw up anywhere between one and three generated frames for every one of the frames that your PC actually renders. This adds some extra input lag, and it won’t necessarily feel smoother (as the generated frames don’t take into account your mouse movements or keyboard presses), but the visual impact can look very fine indeed. On the RTX 5080, MFG also opens up the possibility of above-60fps framerates at while combining 4K with some of the most demanding ray tracing and path tracing effects in the business. In all three games I tried, applying the 4x frame gen option let it saunter past the RTX 4090, whose DLSS 3 version maxes out at the equivalent of MFG’s 2x setting.', 'Outside of benchmark nerdery, everything looks and feels playable, though Alan Wake II did start pushing 100ms of latency with 4x MFG on – enough for aiming to get a little sluggish. I’d probably drop DLSS upscaling from Quality to Balanced, in that case, to bump up that base of 37 non-AI frames per second. That would improve visual smoothness even more while touching up responsivity. Otherwise, though, DLSS 4 makes a persuasive argument in the RTX 5080’s favour, and with 75 compatible games confirmed, it’s getting a far more widely-supported start to life than rival frame gen tech like FSR 3 and XeSS 2 did.', 'As ever, anything 4K can do, 1440p can do faster, and there are good reasons to choose the RTX 5080 for this resolution if you’ve redirected all your monitor upgrade budget into a GPU fund. CPU bottlenecking snips the tall-poppyness of the RTX 5090, allowing this cheaper card to keep pace more effectively, while also narrowing the gap against RTX 4090 and downright styling on the RTX 3090.', 'That said, it’s worth waiting for the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti at this stage. The RTX 5080 is undoubtedly a barnstormer at 1440p but unlike with 4K, there is sometimes a feeling that you’re paying for more power and features than you can use. 4x MFG, for instance, isn’t as useful because the framerates you can get without it are already sky-high: take Cyberpunk 2077 with Psycho ray tracing, which the RTX 5080 could run at 106fps with just Quality-level DLSS upscaling. Most monitors wouldn’t even be able to display all the extra AI frames, even if your eyes could perceive the difference between such speeds – and diminishing returns very much do come into effect.', 'Then again, there is a case for 2x frame gen in some games. F1 24 on Ultra High rose from 116fps with only Quality DLSS to 148fps with frame gen, and that actually did make for a noticeable (if minor) smoothness improvement. The RTX 5080 clearly isn’t a bad GPU for Quad HD – it’s just not the best resolution for spreading its DLSS 4 wings, hence why it’ll be intriguing to see whether the more affordable RTX 5070 duo can make for more suitable matches.', 'Or AMD’s Radeon RX 9070, maybe. That will have its own souped-up DLSS rival in FSR 4, though it sounds like this will be a simpler 2x frame generator in the DLSS 3 vein. With the faster and more flexible MFG, DLSS 4’s pin-sharp Transformer model option, and the GeForce line’s historic advantages with ray and path tracing, it’s hard to see how RDNA 4 GPUs like this will be able to stand up to the RTX 50 series on features.', 'For 4K, anyway, the RTX 5080 is the one to beat. It’s cooler, more efficient, and (not, uh, counting any potential stock shortages) drastically more attainable than the RTX 5090, while still having enough muscle for slick, max-quality performance. Is it as lovable as that poor, reseller-abused RTX 3080? Not so much – a bigger jump up from the RTX 4080 Super would have been appreciated. But it’s better deal overall than both the Super and the original RTX 4080, especially once you start exploiting its more advanced tech. Tech that can help it leave the RTX 4090 behind, let alone those 4080s.', 'This review is based on a retail unit provided by the manufacturer.', 'Find out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.', 'Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in', 'Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.', ""Rock Paper Shotgun is owned by Gamer Network Limited, an IGN Entertainment company and subsidiary of Ziff Davis. © 2025 Gamer Network Limited, 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

The RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti will be available in February, but an exact release date hasn't been revealed."", ""The flagship card, the RTX 5090, is priced at $2,000, and Nvidia claims it's twice as powerful as the RTX 4090 but requires a 1,000-watt power supply--a huge leap from the RTX 4090's 450W baseline power draw. Despite its power demands, the RTX 5090 is more compact than its predecessor, fitting into smaller PC builds."", 'The slimmer size and higher performance are true of all the cards in the lineup, with Nvidia claiming the $1,000 RTX 5080 to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080. The budget-priced $550 RTX 5070 offers performance comparable to the RTX 4090, at nearly a third of the price. The 5070 Ti, meanwhile, sits between the 5070 and 5080 in terms of price ($750) and performance.', ""Rather than relying on pure processing power to achieve these benchmarks, the new 50-Series cards leverage Nvidia's latest machine learning technology, including RTX Neural Shaders and the latest DLSS 4 upscaling. Not only does DLSS 4 allow for upscaling lower-resolution gameplay to 1440p or 4K resolutions, it also includes Multi Frame Generation, which Nvidia says is capable of generating up to three additional frames for every one frame of rendered gameplay. It's essentially doing for gaming what frame smoothing does for movies and TVs and creating the appearance of higher, smoother frame rates without the hardware actually rendering them all."", ""So, while the 50-Series GPUs' actual hardware performance uplift is technically lower in terms of raw processing power without the aid of AI technology--the 5070 has less processing power than the 4090, for instance--it also means the GPUs are smaller and more affordable compared to their previous-gen counterparts since you don't need as much horsepower to achieve high-end results."", ""Of course, AI upscaling and frame generation have tradeoffs compared to rendering everything with hardware. These machine learning technologies can potentially match hardware rendering the quantity of performance, but the issue is the quality of that performance. Upscalers like DLSS, AMD's FSR, and Sony's PSSR on PS5 Pro can be inconsistent (or even incorrect, in extreme cases), while frame generation can introduce noticeable input delay--something that playing at high frame rates is intended to alleviate, not exacerbate."", 'To be fair, these are issues Nvidia--and game developers--are aware of and actively working to address. Besides, plenty of games already utilize the features to great results, and the 40-series cards used DLSS to achieve big performance gains over the 30-series--unfortunately, it was also incredibly expensive. If the next generation of the technology works as intended, the 5090 could enable another massive performance boost, while the mid-range RTX 50 GPUs could offer a much more affordable option for achieving 4K resolution gameplay and high FPS.', 'RTX 50-Series laptop GPUs are on the way as well, with the first models expected to launch in March.', 'More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders', 'Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition review: monster AI gaming from $999,https://www.club386.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review/,"[""As Daft Punk might say if they were PC enthusiasts, Blackwell's high-end GPU is smarter, better, faster, slimmer than any 80-class that's come before."", 'Rather than racing out the door to capitalise on the breakneck momentum set by Blackwell’s flagship, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 strolls out leisurely, aware it’s uncontested. There’s a calm air about it, knowing nothing out there hits the same beat and won’t for quite some time.', 'All eyes here at Club386 continue to wander over to the mighty GeForce RTX 5090 with dreams of sky-high performance, but there’s enough here to keep your attention at half the price. It doesn’t break the bank in the same way at $999, matching the cost of RTX 4080 Super at launch. Whether that keeps is another question entirely, but it’s off to a good start.', 'Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080', '£979 / $999', 'Pros', 'Cons', 'Club386 may earn an affiliate commission when you purchase products through links on our site.\nHow we test and review products.', 'Blackwell architecture brings with it solutions to concerns of stagnating rasterised performance, leveraging Nvidia’s AI expertise to trade brute force for much-improved neural rendering techniques. GeForce RTX 5080 is our first indicator of just how well this sorcery scales down to the high-end and indeed gives us a glimpse at what we can expect from future entries to the series.', 'Let’s consult with the trusty Club386 Table of Doom™ to see where it sits compared to predecessors.', 'GeForce RTX 5080 uses all the GB203 chip has to offer, packing it to the brim. All seven graphics processing clusters (GPCs) are in effect, giving it a modest 5% more CUDA cores than its predecessor at 10,752. That’s half of what you get inside the top-of-the-range GeForce RTX 5090, but still a decent leap from where we were just four years ago.', 'Some might question Nvidia steering the course with an identical memory configuration as GeForce RTX 4080. HD texture packs and ray tracing raise the ceiling ever higher, potentially leaving 16GB across a 256-bit bus something of a stickler in some games. As the old adage goes, it’s not how big it is, but how you use it.', 'Nvidia has moved to high-speed GDDR7, amping up speeds courtesy of 30Gb/s modules – the fastest we’ve seen yet. There is a desire for more as the total bandwidth is once again half its bigger brother at 960GB/s, but that’s still a 30% leap over other 80-class cards.', 'Of course, none of this paints the full picture of Blackwell. Nvidia kicks off its AI-led revolution with some impressive architectural tinkering and AI witchcraft in an attempt to create a card that’s great for both work and play.', 'GeForce RTX 5080 elicits some deja vu with hardware, featuring the same TSMC 4N process as its predecessor. With an ever-so-slightly smaller 378mm2 die, Nvidia carves out room for its expanded 84 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) by dialling back transistors a touch. A definitively worthwhile trade, owing to its new shader layout packing a huge punch.', 'Each SM carries the same general configuration of 128 shaders, four Tensor Cores, four Texture Units, and a single RT Core, but with a couple of key differences. Firstly, Tensor Cores enter their fifth generation, now supporting new quantisation formats and precisions to speed up training and utilising machine learning. It’s Nvidia’s AI bedrock decades in the making.', 'Secondly, and more importantly for a gaming card such as this, cores can now process either floating point or integer workloads. We go into more detail in our GeForce RTX 5090 review, but this essentially leaves no wasted potential as games make use of INT32. Being even handed, Nvidia doesn’t increase the ROP count between generations, meaning raster performance won’t see the jump it could have done.', 'Nvidia came to play with its RTX 40 Series, boosting performance with Frame Generation on top of AI upscalers. The premise is simple enough, using Tensor Cores to sandwich a single AI-generated frame in between each rasterised frame for a sweet 55% fps jump using DLSS Quality in our GeForce RTX 4090 review.', 'Taking things a step further, Blackwell amplifies this threefold with its new Multi-frame Generation (MFG) slipping in a total of three synthetic frames for every rendered one. You can see the results for yourself by heading into the performance section, but in many cases, it can net up to double the frame rate in some games.', 'It’s an idea Nvidia has long ruminated on but only managed to implement successfully into RTX 50 Series after a few necessary tweaks under the hood. Not quite the full-on Google approach to software, instead creating harmony with the hardware underneath.', 'Improved Flip Metering nails the timing of each AI-generated frame, keeping them in line with rasterised ones to prevent stumbling and stuttering that would otherwise make all improvements null and void. Also gone is the previous hardware-based Optical Flow Accelerator, traded in for a more reliable deploy-once AI model that’s both 40% faster and consumes 30% less VRAM.', '16GB of GDDR7 on top of RTX 5080 starts to look a little more understandable as a result. Finally, a new AI Management Processor (AMP) keeps all of this in check like a good project manager should.', 'Part and parcel with fresh rendering technology is a new AI model it can use to generate pixels. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is still alive and kicking in games that support super resolution, but Nvidia has already refined it to within an inch of its life. Whatever pitfalls you’ve noticed when using it, such as ghosting and blooming, are there to stay.', 'The only way to improve visual fidelity and combat those pesky artefacts is to switch things up, which is where Google’s Transformer Model comes in. Dating back to 2017, it’s currently the most popular model seen within ChatGPT and Gemini, and for good reason. It carries a larger overhead, as Nvidia claims it requires twice the parameters and four times the compute compared to CNN, but with it comes improved temporal stability that’s the closest we’ve ever been to native without directly rendering each individual frame.', 'RTX 5080 and its Blackwell cohorts benefit most with the enhancements it brings to Multi Frame Generation, but it’s not confined to the latest lineup. It also improves standard Frame Generation for RTX 40 Series cards, and extends its reach to uplift Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA) across the entire RTX ecosystem. You can run an RTX 2060 and you’ll still enjoy the augmentation.', 'The only caveat is one it shares with MFG in that it requires developer implementation. DLSS Override from within the Nvidia App only takes you so far without the codebase to work from. I have my highest hopes that devs will be quick to set it all up after seeing the wonderous things it can do in Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077, but that’s the test of time as we know it.', 'Nvidia has the craft of its Founders Edition models down to a fine art at this point, producing some of the sexiest graphics cards on the market. If you ask me, RTX 40 Series lost the magic a little as its three-slot bulk didn’t suit the professional aesthetic Team Green strives for, but it was a necessary evil of sorts to tame the beast beneath. Fortunately, elegance is well and truly back in RTX 50 Series thanks to major cooling innovations.', 'Returning to a slimmer two-slot form factor, GeForce RTX 5080 has no trouble fitting in most rigs at 304mm x 137mm. These dimensions qualify it for Nvidia’s SFF-ready badge of honour, although you’re always best whipping out your trusty tape measure before sticking it inside a mini PC.', 'Sharing the exact same chassis as GeForce RTX 5090 FE, Nvidia toes a familiar line with its colour scheme. As much as I’d love to see a bleached Founders Edition primed for my white build, there’s no arguing that grey and black fit in most themes. Gone is large, front-facing branding, replaced with a subtle etching to let everyone know which model you sport, while dinky LED strips accentuate the eye-catching X pattern in the centre.', 'Both fans now sit side by side in a more traditional arrangement, blowing air past the new vapour chamber and out through two concaved fin stacks. The combination of curved and straight fins helps reduce pressure, with the longest optimising airflow where it’s greatest. Meanwhile, angled exhausts on the side do their darndest to direct heat away from the card rather than recycling it back through the fans again.', 'All in all, it’s a lot of engineering to keep the uniquely centralised 378.6mm2 die cool on top of Nvidia’s smallest PCB to date, but the changes don’t stop there. Relocating everything to the middle of the card increases the distance between the board and both the PCIe slot and I/O, prompting boffins to spin a web of proprietary PCBs and ribbon cables to reach all the necessary ports.', 'None of this technical wizardry slows RTX 5080 down in the slightest. In fact, Nvidia outfits it with the latest cables out there, and its single HDMI 2.1b and three DisplayPort 2.1b slots have enough bandwidth to push up to 4K 12-bit HDR at 480Hz or 8K 12-bit HDR at 165Hz – alongside display stream compression (DSC) that is.', 'The return of the 12VHPWR power connector is no surprise despite its exceptionally rocky start in life. After all, its 16 pins deliver an ample 600W current through a single cable, which is more than enough to saturate RTX 5080’s 360W hunger. You’ll be pleased to know Nvidia has made some tweaks to the interface by following the much-improved 12V-2×6 variant, reinforcing the contact block and securing the pins. Still, if you’re a worry wart like me, MSI adapters (sold separately) offer peace of mind with yellow housing to ensure nothing’s loose.', 'I highly suggest pairing RTX 5080 with a modern power supply outfitted with a 12VHPWR header, as it offers a streamlined look with one thin cable from end to end. However, you don’t need to invest in a new PSU just for a simple wire. You’ll spot a three-way, eight-pin splitter in the box that’ll hook up to most units out there. Just keep in mind Nvidia recommends 850W to account for all your other components.', 'Better safe than sorry, but 850W seems like a conservative estimate to me. RTX 5080 is a rather polite guest inside our beefy Club386 test bench, as the whole system runs at just 475W when gaming and 101W while idling.', 'This is less than Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which itself carries a slimmer 800W suggestion from AMD. Fill out four memory lanes, perhaps add in an RGB strip or two and power expectations will creep up, but the ceiling seems lower than initially anticipated, which is a welcome bonus.', 'Slimming power demands within 4% of its predecessor pairs well with Nvidia’s Double Flow Through cooler, keeping RTX 5080 as cool as a cucumber – you must like hot cucumbers (ed). Peak gaming temperatures reach no higher than 64°C, which is impeccable for a dual-slot solution eschewing liquid metal in favour of a traditional thermal compound solution, all while fans spin at just 39.5dB. We’ve yet to hear anything quieter, which is quite the oxymoron.', 'A quick reminder of its $999 price tag, and GeForce RTX 5080 appears to be one of the most compelling cards in the Blackwell line-up. Sadly, you might struggle to get your hands on one if rumblings of stock shortages are anything to go by, particularly in a sleek Founders Edition dress. Just keep an eye on Nvidia’s website and your finger hovering over F5 any time from tomorrow, January 30.', 'Our 7950X3D Test PCs', 'Club386 carefully chooses each component in a test bench to best suit the review at hand. When you view our benchmarks, you’re not just getting an opinion, but the results of rigorous testing carried out using hardware we trust.', 'Shop Club386 test platform components:', 'CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\nMotherboard: MSI MEG X670E ACE\nCooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer III 420 A-RGB\nGPU: Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 7800 XT\nMemory: 64GB Kingston Fury Beast DDR5\nStorage: 2TB WD_Black SN850X NVMe SSD\nPSU: be quiet! Dark Power Pro 13 1,300W\nChassis: Fractal Design Torrent Grey', 'To capture where GeForce RTX 5080 sits in the current market, we’ve tested a total of nine graphics cards from scratch. Spoiler alert: armed with the latest drivers in their respective ecosystems, even the best AMD Radeon struggles to earn its place against Nvidia’s latest high-end powerhouse.', 'Leaked 3DMark Time Spy results already spoiled this one for us ahead of launch as other tests in the Futuremark suite seem to follow suit. RTX 5080 shows its ray tracing chops in 3DMark Speed Way by slotting in between two predecessors, offering a 20% uptick over RTX 4080 Super while just 14% shy of RTX 4090.', 'It’s no match for the mighty RTX 5090, but 37% less performance doesn’t seem so bad when you save half the cost. Meanwhile, AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX just about claws into the top-five graphics cards we’ve tested by default. One has to wonder if that’ll stay the case when more Blackwell GPUs arrive.', '3DMark Steel Nomad strips all the fancy rendering techniques to focus purely on rasterisation, yielding fairly similar results to its ray-traced counterpart. RTX 5080 once again falls behind the flagship’s staggering lead by 40%, but it still over performs relative to its price – and this is before we get into the magic of AI.', 'It’s a far closer fight in the high end, as RTX 5080 tickles the heels of RTX 4090 with just 11% in it between the two. Otherwise, you can expect anything from a 23% lead over its rivals and predecessors.', 'RTX 5080 might be more of a gaming card, but content creation isn’t lost on the pusher of pixels. It’s capable of 9,189 samples per minute in Blender, placing it 39% short of its bigger brother and 18% behind the Ada Lovelace champion. Again, it’s hard not to highlight the disparity in value here, given it also saves you 50% and 33% from their respective MSRPs.', 'Comparatively, RTX 5080 is just 8% more productive in 3D rendering than the likes of RTX 4080 Super, but for the same cost. One for one, it’s a net positive. This is sure to perk up the ears of RTX 30 Series or AMD Radeon owners, who net anything from 64% to double the performance.', 'Given Nvidia’s focus on artificial intelligence, it’s no surprise to see RTX 5080 standing tall as the only graphics card able to go toe-to-toe with the king. It’s still 16% short of RTX 5090 in Geekbench AI, but a comfortable 15% ahead of the closest competition. As far as cost-conscious AI performance goes, there is simply nothing else in this price range.', 'Leaving the flagship to play in a league of its own, RTX 5080 is almost neck and neck with RTX 4090 in Procyon’s AI Text Generation benchmark. This subjects our graphics cards to several large language models (LLMs) using Llama 3.1 as a framework.', 'Once again expect to see double the performance of AMD Radeon’s best and brightest, a minimum 31% leap from Nvidia’s Ampere Series, and a 19% jump from the previous generation. It’s safe to say it’ll make short work of generative AI.', 'Synthetic tests tell but half the story, so allow good old games to fill in the real-world blanks. Our baseball team of graphics cards is batting against a roster of triple A titles, each pitching with the three most popular resolutions – 1920×1080 (FHD), 2560×1440 (QHD) and 3840×2160 (UHD).', 'Credit where it’s due, AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX shows up when it comes to crunch time, but it’s still not enough to topple RTX 5080 in Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Granted, Team Red might clinch the value proposition with just a few frames in it between the two, but don’t count out Blackwell’s high-end just yet as we’ll soon see its secret weapon in action.', 'Speaking of price to performance, RTX 5080 sits within just 12% of the flagship at FHD. This grows to 20% at QHD and 27% at UHD, but still half the price you’ll pay for the pleasure. It’s starting to look like the card gamers dream about.', 'It’s a similar story with Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. RTX 5080 proves its mettle in FHD compared to 90-class alternatives but still keeps a respectable margin at higher resolutions. It outpaces everything AMD has to offer, while falling just 35% short of the top dog.', 'You might get more out of RTX 4090 if you hunt around for a good deal, but it’ll need to be lower than $700 to offer anything of substance. All in all, it just further underscores how much of a bargain RTX 5080 is at MSRP.', 'Forza Motorsport is a particularly demanding game where even the best graphics card in the world can’t achieve triple-digit frame rates at 4K. Fortunately, RTX 5080 keeps a smooth frame rate at all resolutions compared to most of its peers, proving a worthwhile upgrade from Ampere and Radeon 7000 Series alike. It even steals some thunder from RTX 4090, sitting withing just 7fps.', 'Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the first time we see RTX 5080 wobble, slipping halfway down the pack. It’s hard to whine about any graphics card capable of 350fps, but there’s no denying that the strategy game responds to other models better at lower resolutions.', 'Crank things higher and the Blackwell GPU starts to come into its own again, leaping 17% past its predecessor and 6% over its rival at UHD.', 'Slight fluctuations in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction don’t detract from the overall theme that RTX 5080 belongs in between RTX 4080 Super and RTX 4090 in terms of rasterised performance, regardless of resolution. Simply take a look at this averaged table to see for yourself using UHD as a reference point:', 'Moving to Blackwell might prove a tough sell for previous generation owners going off rasterised performance alone, but RTX 5080 is a far more meaningful option for anyone coming from the midrange or something a little older. Still, let’s not draw any conclusions just yet. There’s still the matter of all those AI accelerators under the hood.', 'First, a quick history lesson about frame generation (FG) to lay the groundwork. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 benefits from both FSR and DLSS, but our RTX 5080 barely sees a bump moving from native performance to Quality upscaling. Instead, the largest uplift comes from added AI-generated frames, seeing 30% more than other rendering techniques.', 'This is true of all models, with DLSS Frame Generation coming out slightly ahead of FSR3 Frame Generation for supported RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs. To paraphrase Happy Gilmore, “it ain’t over yet. The way Nvidia sees it, we’ve only just begun.”', 'Putting all of Nvidia’s upscalers against the wall, 3DMark’s new DLSS test shows a decent uplift simply moving from one generation of FG to the next. Alongside reflecting on just how far we’ve come from the small beginnings of DLSS 2, there’s proof in the pudding that even RTX 40 Series benefits from Team Green’s tweaking.', 'It doesn’t stop there, though. GeForce RTX 5080 uses Multi Frame Generation, which slips a second (3x) and third (4x) AI-generated frame in for good measure. While our high-end card already performs admirably, it eclipses RTX 4090’s capabilities by up to 55% when the feature is dialled up to 11, cementing its place as the second-best graphics card money can buy right now.', 'Putting this into practice, an early build of Alan Wake 2’s MFG update shows just how much the survival horror game benefits from the new feature. Settings such as path tracing make even the strongest graphics cards buckle without a helping hand, but RTX 5080 goes from barely playable at UHD using just DLSS to maxing out 144Hz gaming monitors with room to spare. It feels like magic, considering it’s all nestled in a single option.', 'Much like Nvidia showcased during its reveal, it has noticeably polished its neural rendering suite, as there are far fewer shimmers, glimmers, ghosting, and blooming than previous upscalers. However, that doesn’t mean MFG is perfect. Keen eyes will eventually spot the odd thing that doesn’t belong, but to my peepers, neon signs boast more clarity than ever, and finer details like wires and hair behave as they should.', 'While pure rasterisation debatably feels better as you pan the camera around the titular character, 153fps with MFG is undoubtedly smoother than sub-60fps without the artificial leg up. Synthetic is simply the way forward as brute force hardware yields diminishing returns. Nvidia is just refining it quicker than anyone else.', 'Cyberpunk 2077 is another one renowned, or perhaps infamous, for its incredibly demanding ray-tracing presets. A graphics card even remotely glancing at Overdrive starts to work up a sweat. You can see for yourself in the tables above, with Radeon struggling to muster up enough gumption to break triple digits at FHD and falling far short of the 60fps ideal at UHD.', 'Multi Frame Generation changes the game entirely, delivering comfortable frame rates across the board. It works best with a base of at least 60fps to work with, but that doesn’t stop 4x frame generation from boosting RTX 5080’s lowly 19fps native showing at 4K to a staggering 137fps – a 621% increase.', 'Of course, it’s early days for MFG and I’ve yet to see how it plays out across the 75 announced launch titles, but it makes a solid first impression. Its scalability opens plenty of doors, from higher resolutions such as 8K when displays inevitably land on our doorstep to competitive frame rates without giving up that all important detail, and improved battery life should it ever grace a gaming handheld.', 'As much as my mind can wander musing the endless possibilities of its bright future, I can’t argue with its impact in the here and now, too. Just make sure you check DLSS MFG support in your favourite titles before deciding to cop an RTX 50 Series card for yourself, as while there’s possibility of using it via override in the control panel, optimised implementation remains in the hands of developers.', 'With GeForce RTX 5080, Nvidia cements Blackwell graphics cards as the go-to for gamers, content creators, and AI enthusiasts. Much like GeForce RTX 5090, it arrives on the scene with no equal yet carries a slimmer $999 price tag than RTX 4080 to lower the barrier to entry. No small chunk of change, but those with deep enough pockets will find value, even compared to the flagship. It’s half the price, but always more than half its performance.', 'Leaner generational gains in rasterised performance alongside sticking with 16GB of memory make it less enticing for anyone jumping ship from high-end RTX 40 Series solutions, but Nvidia has built on its frame-generation foundations well. Combined with a smarter neural network, RTX 5080 pushes supported games to the nth degree, often doubling anything RTX 4080 Super can handle while sporting fewer artefacts in the process.', 'Optimised Multi Frame Generation compatibility rests in the hands of developers, making additional performance something of a bonus rather than a given. Still, 75 games and apps right off the bat shows commitment to the cause, instilling faith that there are many more to come. Even without the promise the feature will appear in your favourite title, RTX 5080 is a fine card.', '']"
"Nvidia RTX 5090 Might Be Out Of Stock Through June, Says UK Retailer",https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/nvidia-rtx-5090-might-be-out-of-stock-through-june,"['Major British computing retailer, Overclockers UK, has posted a sobering warning to Nvidia fans hoping to get their hands on one of the new RTX 50-series graphics cards. With all stock sold out and pre-order ceased, OCUK is warning that stock of the RTX 5090 might not arrive until as late as June. That’s a worst-case scenario, but at best it won’t arrive until March, meaning it’s likely to be a long time until everyone gets the cards they want.', ""Nvidia’s RTX 50-series blew open the doors of CES 2025 with a freight train of hype. Major promises were made, and though the actual reviews paint a different picture, there’s no denying that these cards are some of the best in the world, even if they're only a little faster than the RTX 40-series. The problem is, people can't buy them. Some major US retailers reportedly had just a handful of graphics cards to go around and the global supply appears almost non-existent just a few days after the launch."", 'The rumored reason for these delays isn’t just due to availability, but how Nvidia is handling it. VideoCardz has a report from Dutch suppliers that Nvidia is arbitrarily sending stock of the cards to partners in batches, making it hard for them to sell the cards on in any kind of cohesive way. Some of those batches can be spread far apart, too, such as Asus getting certain 5080 and 5090 cards in mid-February, but then nothing else until the end of March. The quoted individual suggests there won’t be any stock of Founders edition cards in Europe until March, either.', 'It’s noteworthy, too, that Overclockers UK seems to be out of the loop as to when stock can be expected. It has halted pre-orders at this time, since it cannot guarantee when existing pre-orders can be filled and will look to complete those before taking any more. ', 'Although Nvidia cards are regularly out of stock (and overpriced on the second-hand market) around launch, this is a particularly egregious example of limited supply. In the past Nvidia has blamed such events on a surprise amount of interest in the new cards from crypto or pandemic-era gaming, but it seems hard to take that at face value when the delays are so long. Nvidia reportedly halted RTX 4090 production in late 2024 to ramp up production of the new cards. ', 'All of this raises even more questions about the impending launch of the RTX 5070 Ti. Expected to appear in February, it could prove popular if it’s the only RTX 50-series card available, with frame generation support.

Engadget published its review of the $2,000 RTX 5090 last week, but if you’re reading this article, chances are you already know if you want to splurge on a 50 series card. The question then is how to buy one. If you're reading this story on or after January 30, the good news is that major retailers, including Best Buy and Newegg, have officially begun selling the first wave of NVIDIA's new GPUs."", 'As for the bad news? If the 50 series launch is anything like the 40 series one before it, expect high demand and limited initial availability; in fact, NVIDIA has warned RTX 5090 and 5080 stock will be constrained. If you’re set on buying an RTX 5070 Ti or 5070 at release, be sure to use the notification feature Best Buy and other retailers offer to have the best chance of securing one of the cards before they all sell out.', 'GeForce RTX 5090 for $2,000: The RTX 5090 is the most expensive consumer GPU NVIDIA has ever released. It’s also one of the most powerful and power-hungry, with the 5090 featuring 21,760 CUDA cores, 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM and a potential total power draw of 575W.', 'Of course, as with all of NVIDIA’s new GPUs, raw specs are only half the story. In conjunction with DLSS 4, the entire 50 series is capable of multi-frame generation. With the tech, RTX 50 GPUs can generate up to three additional frames for every frame they render using traditional techniques. DLSS 4 is the reason the 5090 can produce an average of 246 frames per second with full ray tracing in games like Cyberpunk 2077.', 'If you prefer to buy from Newegg or Best Buy, both retailers will stock models from third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI and Zotac.', ""GeForce RTX 5080 for $999: The RTX 5080 features 10,752 CUDA cores and 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, with a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec. Like the 5090, you get the benefit of DLSS 4 multi-frame generation. Moreover, total power draw is more modest at 360W, meaning you probably won’t need a 1,000W PSU to power the 5080. Early reviews of the 5080 have been mixed, but that hasn't stopped people from buying the new high-end card."", 'Again, both Newegg and Best Buy will stock third-party options. For a Founders Edition model, your best bets are NVIDIA and Best Buy.', 'GeForce RTX 5070 Ti for $749. If I had to guess, the 5070 Ti is probably the model with the most interest from people who want to buy a 50 series card. That’s because it features 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM compared to the 5070’s 12GB. An extra 4GB of VRAM might not seem like much, but it will likely translate to the 5070 Ti being a much better purchase over the long run. Modern AAA games use a lot of VRAM, so much so that 8GB GPUs like the RTX 3070 are starting to show their age.', ""Unfortunately, the 5070 Ti is the one model NVIDIA won't offer a Founders Edition version of, so finding one to buy may be tricky. Your best bet here is likely to be B&H. The retailer is showing a few 5070 Ti models on its website, though you'll need to wait until February for those to arrive."", 'GeForce RTX 5070 for $549: At launch, the RTX 5070 will be NVIDIA’s most affordable 50 series GPU. It’s also the GPU NVIDIA claims is as fast as the RTX 4090. Of course, that’s with DLSS 4 enabled. If you’re interested in the 5070, I strongly advise waiting for reviews to come out before you commit to buying one. As mentioned, with only 12GB of VRAM, the 5070 could quickly become a bottleneck to your system.', ""Update 1/29/25 1:50PM ET: As one may have predicted, it seems like it will be difficult to get your hands on one of NVIDIA’s new graphics cards. The company itself stated publicly that it “expect significant demand for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 and believes stock-outs may happen.” It’s possible that limited availability, or widespread stock-outs, could affect customers worldwide. It's reported that some countries, like Korea, won't see shipments until mid-February."", 'Update 1/30/25 10:10AM ET: We updated this piece with more information about availability now that some of the cards are officially up for sale.']"

The GB203 graphics chip is roughly half the size of a GB202 chip, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is also akin to half an RTX 5090 in many ways. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 has 10,752 CUDA cores, 16GB of GDDR7, and a 256-bit memory interface, all of which are either precisely or almost exactly half of what you’ll find on the RTX 5090.', ""Two aspects of the RTX 5080 are better than the RTX 5090 other than its price. First, its peak power consumption is way lower, at 360 watts versus the RTX 5090’s 575W. While it's not a primary concern in desktops for most users, a lower power draw is ideal for many reasons. This is especially true if it means you don't have to upgrade your power supply to support a new card. (The RTX 5090 really needs a 1,000W-plus model.) The second thing is the clock speeds, which are much higher on the RTX 5080 to make up, somewhat, for the reduced core count."", 'Naturally, as it uses a Blackwell-based graphics chip, the RTX 5080 benefits from all the same performance gains that architecture provides over the last-gen Nvidia ""Ada Lovelace"" architecture. The GPU will also benefit from features like Nvidia\'s RTX Neural Shaders once they arrive in supported games, and it can employ DLSS 4 in games that support the new frame-generation technology to generate extra frames if you need the performance boost. If you want to know more about those features, you should read our other articles linked here, where we have discussed these features directly. But for now, let\'s move on to the card we tested.', 'From one perspective, this Founders Edition card directly from Nvidia feels like a super-premium, weighty product; it is the same size as the Nvidia Geforce RTX 5090. However, compared with the last-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super, it actually feels relatively small.', 'That the design is so similar to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5090 is promising. (Also see our original hands-on with the RTX 5090.) That card stayed well-cooled when we tested it, and the GeForce RTX 5080 has an identical thermal solution that allows the fans to push air through heatsinks and over cooling pipes that run to the left and right sides of the circuit board. This design, while more complex from a manufacturing standpoint (as it squeezes much of the key circuitry into the middle of the graphics card), should provide better cooling, as more air can flow through the card and its thermal hardware.', ""The rear I/O panel of the RTX 5080 Founders Edition is also unchanged, with one HDMI port and three DisplayPort ports. To power this card, you will either need a power supply with a native 12VHPWR connector (Nvidia's late-model power connector) or the adapter that Nvidia supplies with the card, which converts three 8-pin PCI Express power connectors to the single 12VHPWR connector on the top edge of the card. The adapters Nvidia is sending out with the RTX 50-series look and feel much higher quality than those supplied with Nvidia's RTX 30- and RTX 40-series cards, with much more flexible cables allowing for easier routing and bends that are less worrisome, given this cable's and connector's history. Also, the angled placement of the power-in port on the graphics card is an improvement, helping to support the power cable and make it less vulnerable to damage."", 'We tested the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition on our newly built graphics card testbed that has an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. The system has two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM operating in a dual-channel configuration with an AMD EXPO profile of 6,000MHz. For storage, we use two Crucial M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSDs, with one (a 2TB drive) dedicated to games and the other (4TB) holding Windows 11 and all other software that isn’t a game. A 1,500W Corsair power supply powers the PC.', 'Unlike the dominant Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, the GeForce RTX 5080 has many rivals. For those with a big budget for their gaming PC, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is a competitor, as is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, though both are prohibitively expensive otherwise. Also, while the RTX 5090 has no real competition in terms of performance, as you’ll soon see, the RTX 5080 seriously undercuts the RTX 4090 on the value front.', 'Eventually, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 will also have to compete with Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. However, as that $749 card hasn’t launched yet, the rest of the RTX 5080’s competition comes from last-gen opponents. The RTX 4080 Super, the RTX 4080, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super all provide something in the way of competition via either raw performance or lower prices.', 'This is also true of the AMD competition, as cards like the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX are still quite capable; that flagship Radeon now retails for less than its original $999 launch price.', ""Because we are still updating our GPU testing regimen for 2025 and beyond, we could not test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super on these new benchmarks in time for this review, though it's coming. However, it's important to note that generally, we saw single-digit performance gains from the RTX 4080 Super over the base RTX 4080 model compared here when we originally reviewed that card. You can look at it as a slightly lesser proxy for that card."", 'The test results we gathered from 3DMark delivered mixed messages about the RTX 5080’s performance. The Port Royal and Speed Way scores suggest that the RTX 5080 should handily outpace everything except the RTX 4090 and the RTX 5090. The Solar Bay and Steel Nomad scores also give the impression the RTX 5080 is faster, but its lead over the AMD cards and the last-gen Nvidia cards narrowed in these tests compared with Port Royal and Speed Way.', 'Time Spy Extreme, the oldest of the 3DMark tests we ran, painted a somewhat different picture, with the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulling relatively close to the RTX 5080. The 3DMark screen optimization tests also gave this impression, though we must point out that this chart doesn’t show results from a singular test. 3DMark has vendor-specific DLSS, FSR, and XeSS tests intended to run on Nvidia, AMD, and Intel graphics cards, respectively. The tests look identical, and as they test similar features for each company, we are including the results together like this, but take the numbers with a pinch of salt and compare just Nvidia to Nvidia, AMD to AMD.', 'Last, Unigine’s Superposition test showed that the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX may compete better with the RTX 5080 in games that use the OpenGL API. You probably want to look closer into this if you are running Linux, but all of the game tests we ran were DirectX-based, so we don’t have more information on this at the moment.', ""Gaming may be the first thing you think about surrounding a graphics-card upgrade, but cards can also be powerful tools for content creation work. Though it's clearly a very able workhorse, the GeForce RTX 5080 may not be a significant enough step up from last-gen cards to merit an upgrade. Take the PugetBench for Creators benchmark, which we run inside Adobe Premiere Pro 24. The RTX 5080 scored better than the last-gen competitors in the chart, but the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti Super weren’t all that far behind. As those cards will likely be discounted now that the RTX 50 series is rolling out, they could be better-value options for this sort of work if you're coming from something older. (Or, they could be good enough if you already own one.)"", 'The test scores we gathered from the Blender 4.3.0 rendering benchmark also suggest the last-gen RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti Super could be better value options for content creation work if you can score one cheaper. They weren’t faster than the RTX 5080 here, but they were close enough that discounts on last-gen models could be a significant factor. The RTX 5080 performed better in the Chaos V-Ray 6 benchmark, and here, we did see an appealing performance gain in the RTX engine score. (The CUDA engine score should be largely discounted, as Nvidia informed us of a bug with that test on RTX 50-series cards.)', 'The RTX 5080 is certainly a very good engine overall for GPU-accelerated content creation work. Its performance gains just aren’t quite high enough to make it an appealing option for that work, in my opinion, if you are looking at the RTX 5080 as an upgrade from an equivalent RTX 40-series card. The last-gen cards are likely better options from a cost-for-performance standpoint, and if you need the most performance you can get for content creation, look to the RTX 5090 instead.', 'UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. Though this is likely more important for companies that will use AI hardware for specific tasks, it’s still fascinating to see how the AI hardware in these GPUs compares. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.)', ""This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement."", 'Like the content creation tests, the AI tests showed the RTX 5080 with only a slight lead over its last-gen counterparts. But the story is different here. The RTX 5080 may have produced only 11% more tokens per second than the RTX 4080 in the PHI 3.5 test, but AI is all about doing as much work as possible as fast as possible and producing results faster. You may not see parallel relative results in other AI tasks, but the RTX 5080 is clearly a step ahead of previous-gen equivalents in a broad selection of LLMs. The gains may also be greater in tasks that are measured in hours rather than seconds or minutes.', 'The image quality and performance characteristics of DLSS, FSR, and XeSS aren’t quite the same. While similar, these technologies don’t work in quite the same way. This makes comparing the results directly imprecise, as the frames-per-second (fps) scores alone don’t take into consideration image quality differences. Due to this, we are conducting limited DLSS, FSR, and XeSS testing with one game going forward.', 'In the Black Myth: Wukong stand-alone benchmark, the RTX 5080 performed well against the competition. It was faster than the RTX 4090 at 1080p, with the two cards almost tied at 1440p and the RTX 4090 pulling ahead at 4K. The RTX 5080 was also faster than all other cards we tested except the RTX 5090. This situation was unchanged by the use of frame-generation technology, which inflated the numbers but kept all of the cards in the same relative positions.', 'Here, in games that support ray tracing, we see the potential of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 on display. The gains vary significantly from game to game, depending on circumstances, but nowhere does the RTX 5080 disappoint.', 'Starting with Cyberpunk 2077, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 held a noticeable lead over the preceding Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and a much more prominent lead over the AMD competition. The RTX 5080 lagged behind the RTX 4090 and RTX 5090 in this game, but this wasn’t consistent across the board.', 'F1 2024 showed a much more consistent performance gain for the RTX 5080 over the RTX 4080 than Cyberpunk. Whereas with Cyberpunk 2077, the RTX 5080 was between 7% and 16% faster than the RTX 4080, that performance gain stayed between 14% and 18% in F1 2024, depending on the resolution. Notably, the RTX 5080 surpassed the RTX 4090 at 1080p and tied with it at 1440p.', 'Far Cry 6 showed evidence of a bottleneck from the CPU or the game engine that caused the results to group together far more than expected. This helped the AMD competition to score a rare win over the RTX 5080 at 1080p, and the RTX 5080 likewise didn’t perform as well as the competition at 1440p. This could be related to early drivers for the RTX 5080. At 4K, the RTX 5080 still couldn’t beat the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which tied with it, but it was faster than the RTX 4080 at this resolution.', 'In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, the RTX 5080 returned to its usual position in the ranks ahead of most competitors. The RTX 5080 outpaced both competing AMD cards here and held a consistent lead over the RTX 4080, but it lagged behind the RTX 4090 and RTX 5090. Returnal again showed the RTX 5080 ahead of the RTX 4090 at 1080p, a near tie at 1440p, and the RTX 4090 ahead at 4K.', 'We have a chart included here for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, but we could not test the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 on this title. We tried multiple successively updated early graphics drivers, but the game crashed each time we ran it on the RTX 5080, so until this issue is corrected, we will not have performance results for the RTX 5080 on this game.', 'Raster-only games do not support ray tracing, so they don’t take advantage of the ray-tracing hardware inside modern graphics cards. These games give AMD more advantage, as its ray-tracing hardware isn’t quite as adept as Intel’s or Nvidia’s. Sure enough, in Total War: Three Kingdoms, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX came closer to matching the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 than in any title so far except the bottlenecked Far Cry 6. The RTX 5080 was still faster, but it didn’t enjoy quite as large of a lead.', 'Total War also showed signs of a CPU bottleneck at the 1080p resolution, which enabled the RTX 5080 to catch up to the 5090 and surpass the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 was also bottlenecked at 1440p, but none of the other cards was. At 1440p, the RTX 5080 was still faster than the RTX 4090 and only fell behind the RTX 4090 at the 4K resolution. The RTX 5080 held a 25% advantage over the RTX 4080 at 4K, which is notable.', 'We likely hit yet another 1080p CPU bottleneck in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, though only the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 were affected this time. Like other results, the RTX 5080 outperformed the RTX 4090 here at 1440p but fell behind at 4K, while none of the other competition was much of a match.', 'We use a Kill-A-Watt power meter to gauge the total power consumption of our graphics card test bed. Since only the graphics card changes, this helps to give us a rough idea of how demanding each card is on power draw. We test with four programs: two content creation apps, and two games.', 'In the content creation tests, the RTX 5080 pulled power numbers close to those of the RTX 4080 while drawing significantly less than the AMD competition and the RTX 5090. This changed in the in-game benchmarks, which set the RTX 5080 with a notably higher power draw than the last-gen RTX 4080. The RTX 5080 was also a little power-hungrier here than the Radeon RX 7900 XTX but significantly less demanding than the voracious RTX 5090.', 'Thermally, the RTX 5080 ran hotter than the RTX 4080 in content creation tests. Given both cards had a similar power draw, and that the RTX 5080 is supposed to have a new, improved thermal design, we would have expected to see the opposite. (That said, the RTX 4080 is indeed much thicker, which means more material for heat dissipation, all else being equal.) In the in-game benchmarks, the RTX 5080 ran hotter than the RTX 4080, but this makes more sense considering its 40W-higher board power rating.', 'The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 may always sit in the RTX 5090’s shadow in terms of raw performance, but if you are a gamer looking to build or upgrade a top-tier gaming PC, it should likely be the top option. If you’ve got the money and won’t miss it, go ahead and buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090. But for that $1,999 you would spend on an RTX 5090, you could realistically drop $999 on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and build out the rest of the gaming PC with the remaining $1,000, or at least start with a tip-top CPU and some nice complementary components.', 'Given $1,999 is already more than most will feel comfortable to drop on a gaming PC, this option looks a lot more alluring for anyone that is remotely budget-conscious. Additionally, CPU and game-engine bottlenecks somewhat limit these gains in places, so getting the full potential out of your RTX 5090 will be tricky at times but easier with an RTX 5080. However, that card, too, encountered bottlenecks here and there at 1080p—not much you can do, though, when you are already running one of the fastest processors (the Ryzen 9 9950X) on the market. We would joke that Nvidia will need to start making its own CPUs to keep up with its graphics card advancements, if we weren’t worried Nvidia would take us seriously and do just that.', ""You'll find worthwhile alternatives to the RTX 5080 for competition, but the RTX 4090 is not one of those. It can be faster than the RTX 5080, but that advantage is far from consistent, with the RTX 5080 sometimes faster. Add to that the RTX 4090’s much higher price, and it's clearly just not a card that works in today’s market sandwiched between the RTX 5080 and the RTX 5090."", ""The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the RTX 4080 Super are more substantial alternatives. We haven’t tested the RTX 4080 Super on our new GPU testbed yet, but on average, it’s only about 5% faster than the standard RTX 4080, so we can well-enough estimate how it will perform. The gains the new RTX 5080 has over the RTX 4080 and the RTX 4080 Super aren’t consistent, varying from a few percentage points to a maximum of around 25%. Given that the RTX 5080 and RTX 4080 Super are both set with an MSRP of $999, it's evident that the RTX 5080 is the card you should buy. A discounted RTX 4080 Super could be a worthwhile alternative, but we'd want to see a substantial markdown before considering it."", 'That’s essentially the same spot that AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT also find themselves in. These cards were more consistently behind the GeForce RTX 5080, but with the proper discount, they could be compelling alternatives. It all comes down to the actual street pricing.', ""Considering all that, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition is the graphics card we recommend if you're looking to play high-resolution, high-refresh-rate games, and plan to spend anything in the region of $1,000. For that, it merits our Editors' Choice award."", 'Francisco La Hoz contributed testing work to this review.', ""Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card outruns its like-priced competitors and predecessors in many popular games.

The RTX 5070, in particular, made headlines as a card that can supposedly rival an RTX 4090 for just $549. We later learned it uses DLSS 4’s AI-powered multi frame generation to achieve that in supported titles, but that’s a welcome compromise for those who can’t find room in their budget for the beefier 4K-ready GPUs — including the $999.99 RTX 5080 and the $1,999.99 RTX 5090.', 'Those premium cards are capable of greater raw performance, however.

Plus, while Nvidia misjudged the pricing of the original RTX 4080, it (just about) returned to form when it launched the cheaper and faster RTX 4080 Super for $999 at the start of 2024. That’s why in our RTX 5080 review we found it to be an easy recommendation, despite a modest performance uplift over the RTX 4080 Super.', 'The RTX 5080 release date was Thursday, January 30, 2025, coming just a few weeks after Nvidia unveiled the new GPU at the CES tradeshow in Las Vegas on January 6.', 'The RTX 5080 price is $999 for the MSRP, which refers to the Nvidia Founders Edition at stock speed.

Its ability to generate two or even three new frames with AI can quadruple perceived frame rates, in theory. In practice, we regularly saw frame rates double over what could be achieved with the single frame generation of DLSS 3 on RTX 4000 series cards.
