Sundance 2025 shows off its wild and predictable sides with genre gambles and straightforward indies,https://www.avclub.com/sundance-2025-reviews-love-brooklyn-heightened-scrutiny-middletown-zodiac-killer-project-endless-cookie-obex,"['The two opposing poles of the Sundance Film Festival are always the overly familiar and the cloyingly offbeat. Too many films fall at the extremes of either side, yet those in the middle are easily written off as “Sundance films” that cram buzzwords together into their own uniquely twee packaging. But even these movies have something to offer as a filmgoer, if only to understand the undercurrent of modern indie (or indie-adjacent, at least) filmmaking. This is the shape of a movie that sells, and this is how up-and-coming directors put their own stamp on it. Sundance 2025 has its own selections that fall into these categories—the predictable and the wacky—with a few films on each end of the spectrum still managing to make their mark.', 'But first, there’s Love, Brooklyn (C), a well-acted but slight “guy needs to grow up” romance between André Holland’s Roger, his ex (Nicole Beharie), and his new flame (DeWanda Wise). Though helmed by accomplished TV director Rachael Holder in her feature debut, the film’s light drama and breezy New York cinematography zips by like Roger on his bike, leaving little impression after the credits roll.', '', 'Though the city and its apartments look nice in a confined way—think High Maintenance or Girls—there’s not a lot of sexual chemistry or comic zing pulling Roger along his arc. This life is realistic, quiet, and more than a little dull. Part of this is due to Roger having very little character of his own, while the more fleshed-out women split screentime. Beharie and Wise are excellent at carving out small details of a dynamic that’s more complex that it seems on the surface, but in a larger narrative sense, everyone’s making the most out of a thin script. Drilling down into the details which, among other too-cute subplots, gives Roger a half-hearted freelance writing assignment about his changing city (and a painful piece of ending voiceover reading from this essay), does the film no favors. It ends up like every other three-person romantic dramedy ends up, but at least Love, Brooklyn boasts competent players going through its motions.', 'More intriguing are two documentaries that find unexpected power in their newsy subject matter. Heightened Scrutiny (B) makes a well-argued case, but not exactly against the topic that ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio is fighting in the Supreme Court. As Strangio prepares to be the first trans lawyer to argue in front of the land’s highest court in United States v. Skrmetti, which assesses the legality of bans on gender-affirming healthcare for trans minors, Sam Feder’s intimate film spreads out its purview to better understand how the nation took a hard turn against trans people. ', '', 'With plenty of moving testimonials and charming talking heads, Heightened Scrutiny draws damning lines between the “just asking questions” opinion pieces published in respected mainstream media publications like The Atlantic and the New York Times and the legal arguments made in our judicial system. The damaging rhetoric in these outlets is directly and immediately echoed by lawyers, judges, and “experts” brought into court—and because of how clicky transphobic stories have historically been, this vicious cycle has recently ramped up. Add in the targeted bigotry of the increasingly radical right, and the legal, cultural, and medical fight for acceptance now waged by trans folks has gotten all the tougher as public awareness has grown. Strangio, charming and dedicated in equal measure, carries us through the rest of the film, even as it loses steam after setting its stage so searingly.', 'Middletown (B) actually ramps up considerably after establishing its “high school A/V club journalists uncover a Dark Waters situation” premise. Sundance regulars Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine (Girls State, Boys State) take on this extremely ‘90s investigation into an environment-poisoning dumping scandal using a massive backlog of archival footage (teacher Fred Isseks’ kids recorded everything they did, even making an hour-long film called Garbage, Gangsters And Greed) and modern-day interviews.', 'As endearing as these high schoolers are, with their gelled hair and big jeans and sailor’s mouths and New Yawka accents, the case is even more compelling. As the problem they’ve encountered just gets bigger and bigger, involving local government officials and trash companies and (yep) the mob, their dogged investigation is inspirational. Even if their actions were raging against a machine too powerful to be moved (and even if Middletown gets a little bogged down in all the threads of the scandal), the pride felt by those who returned for an interview is deeply affecting. A compelling piece of straightforward true-crime that makes the most of its throwback form.', 'A far less straightforward doc that explicitly makes its form part of its subject matter is Zodiac Killer Project (C), which is a self-reflexive exercise in turning lemons into lemonade. Filmmaker Charlie Shackleton almost made a true-crime Zodiac Killer film perfect for half-aware consumption on your streamer of choice. But that film fell through at the last minute, his main source revoking the book rights and leaving Shackleton high and dry. So, instead, he made a film about what that film would’ve been—as cynical about the subgenre and snide about its standard-issue aesthetic as one would expect from someone recently burned by that world.', 'Zodiac Killer Project isn’t getting Netflix money. It’s no Tiger King or Don’t F**k With Cats. It’s a meta project, critiquing the template of this easy-to-digest fad through Shackleton’s constant narration over the anonymous B-roll and stock footage that make up these kinds of docs. For those who haven’t really thought about the filmmaking behind the glut of true-crime clogging up the streamer carousels, there are some revelatory moments of media criticism in here. But for those more aware of how the sausage is made, it’s simply a light and dry bit of jabbing at a dominant kind of media. If you’re already at your true-crime limit, though, this experimental not-making-of can be more demoralizing than anything else.', 'Much sillier and much more successful is the delightfully odd documentary Endless Cookie (B). It’s the first time I’ve ever been able to recommend a nonfiction film about Indigenous people in Canada to those looking to get stoned on their couch and watch some Adult Swim animation. A zany, rambling, bustling portrait of a big family’s cramped, loving, chuckling life in icy Shamattawa, Endless Cookie turns the bond between its filmmaker brothers—white Seth Scriver and his Indigenous brother Pete—into a chaotic storytelling session. ', 'Leaping from the screen in bright baroque colors, the film is somewhere between Superjail! and Richard Scarry, with a community’s smallest moments in constant motion (and probably making a fart sound effect for good measure). It’s all a little overwhelming, but in an enjoyably maximalist way that fills the background with middle fingers to the man—be they the cops, the government, or the very financiers of the film you’re in the middle of watching. As tales about free pizza, animal traps, chicken-stealing, and blacked-out nights drinking unfurl, Endless Cookie will keep you couchlocked, if only to find out what hallucinatory turn it’ll take next.', 'Another of Sundance 2025’s kookier offerings is the new film from Strawberry Mansion’s Albert Birney: OBEX (B-). Where that former film was a colorful analog imagining of a corporatized future where dreams are recorded and taxed by the government, OBEX is a black-and-white film entrenched firmly in the 1980s.', 'There, Conor (Birney), a shut-in ASCII artist with a loving pooch and a home devoted to TV screens and computer monitors, muddles through a slight existence on the fringes of society. The outside is scary, unknown—the drone of locusts and the cheery voice of his unseen grocery delivery person remind us that it’s better inside, where you have some control over what you see and hear. Especially if you have walls and walls of VHS tapes, as Conor does, and a karaoke machine that allows you to sing your own synthy Gary Numan lullaby. But when Conor lets in something beyond his control, a cutting-edge video game that promises to literally put him in the game, his unconscious fears manifest digitally.', 'With a title that alludes to both a communication protocol and the point where our brainstem connects to the spinal cord, OBEX is all about shifting states and the things found in translation. Though it heavily name-checks A Nightmare On Elm Street, OBEX also—like Strawberry Mansion—owes a debt to The Wizard Of Oz. Transplanting that film’s dreamy “and you were there!” psychology to the fantasy world of an old-school RPG, OBEX eventually abandons its effective small-scale worldbuilding in favor of a more ambitious, rambling adventure. ', 'Conor needs to rescue his little dog, which means traversing the game world (alongside a TV-headed companion) and beating the boss. It doesn’t all add up, especially as the narrative makes Conor’s hazy past unmistakably clear, but the film’s still endearingly contained and effectively put together. The horrors when the physical and computational crash into one another are as affecting and disconcerting as Freddy’s bloody hauntings, while its offbeat tech obsession makes Conor’s quiet life poignantly modern. It’s awkward and methodical, but it’s easy to see enough of yourself there that you might get sucked in.', 'Awkward and methodical and almost entirely unpleasant is Serious People (D), an inspired-by-life film about a music video director who—in order to free up some time so he can better support his pregnant partner—hires a guy who looks kinda like him to be his stand-in. The premise dreamed up by writer-directors Ben Mullinkosson and Pasqual Gutierrez (who also stars as a version of himself) has plenty of potential to deflate the egos of self-important “creatives” and stick it to a racist business that sees non-white people as essentially interchangeable, all while dabbling in the deep end of doppelgänger cinema. But that premise is about all they have—their feature is afflicted with short film disease, where a scant few minutes of substance are dragged kicking and screaming to a full runtime. ', 'The fallout from the film’s central bad idea is obvious—of course hiring some guy off the street to represent you professionally and personally would backfire—so all that’s left is to see how bad it gets, and if it ever manages to be funny. But Serious People’s industry-aimed cringe comedy is either entirely facile or buried in the cast’s mumbly, stumbly delivery. Considering Serious People’s anemic aesthetic, too-loose directorial hand, and single gag that it abuses for 84 minutes, even the most insufferable L.A. residents should stick to YouTube supercuts of Saturday Night Live’s “The Californians” sketches.', 'Ranging wildly between insufferable and successful, Rains Over Babel (B-) takes you down into a Colombian punk-rock version of the underworld—think Grim Fandango by way of Romeo + Juliet but without a lick of narrative consistency. Writer-director Gala del Sol’s film is operating solely on vibes, relentlessly recounting random bits of Christian and Greek mythology all dressed up in garish Burning Man chic.', 'As the denizens of its purgatorial nightlife scene work for or against the Grim Reaper (Saray Rebolledo), search for lost souls, or secretly rehearse for their upcoming drag performance, Rains Over Babel flits between storylines with dilated pupils and a feather boa. Along the way, a talking gecko gets a POV scene, the proprietor of Hell’s sex club offers up a delightfully hammy performance, and the afterlife’s best salsa band leaves it all on the dance floor. Would I be less forgiving of its ridiculous plot and ponderous dialogue if it was in English? Probably! But aside from that, its style speaks for itself; Gala del Sol shoots the colorful, queer, costumed-to-kill film with DIY flair. Keep an eye on her to direct the hell out of an episode of the next big mind-bendingly flashy streamer series.', '', 'GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.', '', 'Sign Up', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Paste Media Group.

Sundance 2025: 11 New Films with the Best Shot at an Oscar Run,https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/sundance-2025-oscar-contenders-ranking/,"['', 'The Sundance Film Festival reliably delivers Oscar contenders every year, whether they be usually one or two standout narrative features (like recent picks “A Real Pain,” “A Different Man,” “Living,” and “Minari”) or the lion’s share of Best Documentary Feature nominees (current contenders “Sugarcane,” “Porcelain War,” “Black Box Diaries,” and “Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat” all premiered at the festival, as have past Oscar winners like “Navalny” and “20 Feet from Stardom”).', '2025 should be no exception.', 'But don’t look to all the Sundance 2025 award winners as likely Oscar contenders. Most films with Sundance jury awards, while worthy, are ultimately too small-scale to wind up in Oscar contention. Expect narrative winner “Atropia” and critical favorite “Rebuilding” to land at the Gothams or Indie Spirits. But the international award winners, for example, get a leg up on tipping their countries to submit them for International Feature Film consideration.', 'The lucky movies at Sundance that can fit into the right Oscar box find distributors, hire award campaigners, and wind up shortlisted or even nominated by the new year. Here is our list of potential Sundance entries, narrative and documentary, ranked by how likely they are to make the Oscar cut. —AT', 'The Audience Award winner of the U.S. Dramatic competition lineup caused such a stir online that it had to be taken off the Sundance platform due to piracy concerns. While a viral performance does not always ping on Oscar voters’ radars, Dylan O’Brien’s turn as twin brothers (one deceased, the other grieving him throughout the majority of the film) did earn the former “Teen Wolf” star a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Acting, proving he has the chops.', 'In a different year, the twisted, youthful dramedy from filmmaker/star James Sweeney would not be on this list given the Academy’s vestigial staidness, but seeing how much online enthusiasm played a role in helping actors like Sebastian Stan and Demi Moore secure nominations for unconventional Oscar fare means O’Brien will at least be someone to consider while discussing general awards prospects. —MJ', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Actor for Dylan O’Brien', 'With “Folktales,” established documentarians Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (“Jesus Camp”) focus on three teenagers who embark on a year away from the comforts of home at a venerable school in Norway that puts them through the rigors of the Arctic wilderness. There they learn how to nurture dogs and wield dogsleds and camp in the snow alone. This movie makes you smile, as these modern kids escape from their lonely phones and instead commune with dogs and each other. —AT', 'Possible Nominations: Best Documentary Feature', 'Something often lost in the discussion around Sundance films making it into the awards conversation is how features in the festival’s World competition sections often get chosen as a country’s Oscar submission (“Flee” serves as a recent example). This Turkish thriller, directed by American-Iranian filmmaker Alireza Khatami, has shades of current Oscar nominee “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” in how it tackles issues of patriarchal trauma and toxic masculinity.', 'Good word of mouth, a Directing Award from the World Cinema Dramatic competition jury, and Turkey, France, Poland, and Canada all being involved in its production, give the film several avenues toward making it into the Oscar race. —MJ', 'Possible Nominations: Best International Feature', 'Director Brittany Shyne’s feature debut, which won the U.S. Grand Jury Prize for Documentary, is a captivating look at the struggles Black American farmers are currently going through to maintain their land and legacy. Its cinéma vérité approach has the effect of inviting the audience into the families it follows, making the stakes of the farmer’s efforts to overcome discrimination all the more personal. Though it is quieter and a tad longer than the average Sundance film, the black-and-white picture has style, and a message that one could see the Documentary branch responding to. —MJ', 'Possible Nominations: Best Documentary Feature', 'Eva Victor went from being one of the pioneers of front-facing comedy videos to writing, directing, and starring in the most talked-about debut at Sundance 2025. Though the film treads painfully familiar territory in its depiction of the aftermath of the “bad thing” that happens to grad student Agnes, it does so in such a unique, assured way that will linger in the minds of viewers. Though the film is not of the same scale as the average Oscar contender, its producers, Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski of Pastel, have made Oscar magic happen before with A24, which just acquired the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award winner (an honor that was given to current Academy Award nominee “A Real Pain” last year). —MJ', 'Possible Nominations: Best Original Screenplay for Eva Victor', 'One element that often makes for a great documentary is a compelling figure at the center of the frame. It’s hard not to be hooked into watching whatever trailblazing Iranian councilwoman Sara Shahverdi, the subject of the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize Documentary winner, is doing when one of the first things she does in the film is go straight over to her brother’s house to rip up a contract he had coerced their sisters into signing that would’ve given him and their brothers control over their family inheritance. Whether it is global politics, or stories of women fighting for their rights, the documentary, directed by Mohammad Reza Eyni and Sara Khaki, ticks many boxes for what the Documentary branch of the Academy seems to be looking for in an Oscar contender. —MJ', 'Possible Nominations: \nBest Documentary Feature', 'Bill Condon’s adaptation of Manuel Puig’s classic about the growing rapport between straight Marxist activist Valentin Arregui (Diego Luna) and his gay window-dresser cellmate Luis Molina’ (Tonatiuh) in 1980s Argentina was one of Sundance’s highest-profile sales titles. Condon knows musicals: he wrote the Oscar winners “Chicago” and “Dreamgirls.”', 'In “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” the musical fantasy inside the hard-hitting prison drama stars the glamorous Jennifer Lopez, who couldn’t have been better cast to deliver the demanding Kander & Ebb song-and-dance numbers as movie star Ingrid Luna and her magazine editor character Aurora, as well as the terrifying Spider Woman. A legacy Oscar nomination could finally come her way. At festival’s end, distributors were still vying for a deal. —AT', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Actor for Tonatiuh\nBest Supporting Actress for Jennifer Lopez\nBest Costume Design for Colleen Atwood and Christine Cantella', 'Andrew Jarecki has debuted four projects at Sundance: Oscar-nominated “Capturing the Friedmans” (2003), “Just a Clown” (2004), “Catfish” (2010), and Emmy-winning series “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst” (2015). No stranger to controversy, this time Jarecki delivers a harsh exposé of the brutal Alabama state prison system, a six-year investigative documentary made with long-time producer-turned-co-director Charlotte Kaufman. The filmmakers leaned on prisoners throughout Alabama prisons to send them video footage taken on their contraband phones, as well as interviews with the inmates. —AT', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Documentary Feature', 'Critics raved about Rose Byrne’s performance as a beleaguered mom having the worst week of her life with an absent husband, afflicted child, and hostile therapist. This follow-up to writer/director Mary Bronstein’s “Yeast” (produced by her husband Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie) is “a horror movie about motherhood,” said IndieWire’s Ryan Lattanzio, that boasts a strong supporting cast including Conan O’Brien, Danielle Macdonald, and A$AP Rocky. —AT', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Actress for Rose Byrne\nBest Original Screenplay for Mary Bronstein', 'Emmy-winning non-fiction filmmaker Geeta Gandbhir, who started out as an editor, figured out that she could use footage from police cameras to tell the story of how one Florida neighbor shot another through her front door and killed her. Painstakingly, we watch the tension build as police are called in over and over by the single older white woman with a “No Trespassing” sign in her yard who cannot abide the noise made by the neighborhood kids playing. Gandghir and her gifted editor Viridiana Lieberman create a riveting narrative featuring surprisingly sympathetic law enforcement officers. —AT', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Documentary Feature', 'One major Sundance buy was Clint Bentley’s sophomore magic-hour period drama “Train Dreams,” which went to Netflix. Oscar-nominated Bentley and his “Sing Sing” and “Jockey” co-writer Greg Kwedar adapted the tragic story of one man’s life from Denis Johnson’s 2011 novella. (The narration, by Will Patton, is hugely effective.) The movie stars an Oscar-worthy Joel Edgerton as a Northwestern logger forced to spend months away from his beloved wife, Felicity Jones. He says little but when he finally expresses himself, it’s heartbreaking. Think “Days of Heaven” meets “Sometimes a Great Notion.” —AT', 'Possible Nominations:\nBest Picture\nBest Director for Clint Bentley\nBest Actor for Joel Edgerton\nBest Adapted Screenplay for Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar\nBest Cinematography for Adolpho Veloso', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Critics Survey: The Best Movies of Sundance 2025, According to 176 Critics",https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/sundance-2025-best-movies-critics-survey-1235091788/,"['', 'Sundance is a place for discovery, where new stars are minted because of the fresh, invigorating images they bring to the screen. It was where Steven Soderbergh helped kick off the indie film revolution in 1989 with “sex, lies, and videotape” and Quentin Tarantino launched “Reservoir Dogs” in 1992. They showed that, at Sundance, if you have something to say, you can have a seat at the table.', 'This year, that daring new voice belongs to Eva Victor, whose comedic character study “Sorry, Baby,” about a young professor reeling from a trauma, sold to A24 for $8 million. “Sorry, Baby” also has the distinction of placing first in many of the categories in IndieWire’s 2025 Sundance Critics Survey, including Best Performance (for Victor herself), Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best First Film, and Best Film itself.', '', 'Though “Sorry, Baby” was the undeniable favorite across the board at Sundance 2025, our critics survey shared the love with a number of other films as well, especially “Twinless,” “Train Dreams,” and “Omaha,” as well as the astonishing Rose Byrne-starring “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” which broke through at several spots on our list despite being an in-person only film that had to be seen in Park City, Utah.', '176 critics voted in this year’s survey, and though “Sorry, Baby,” “Twinless,” and “Train Dreams” were on the virtual platform that Sundance rolled out for home viewing, it’s notable to see how many movies here worked their way onto these lists via in-person only screenings. If you weren’t at the Eccles for that rousing world premiere of Michael Shanks’ body horror “Together,” you missed out on one very reactive audience.', 'Voting for the survey involved choosing a ranked top three for most of the categories (with three points going to the #1 vote, two points to the #2 vote, and one point for the #3 vote), much like the Academy Awards’ own preferential ballot system.', 'Best Documentary went to “The Perfect Neighbor,” Geeta Gandbhir’s startling nonfiction account of how “stand your ground” laws can escalate petty disputes into tragedy, and Best International Fiction Film and Best International Documentary film (both categories where voters chose only one selection) went to Turkish potboiler “The Things You Kill” and Oscar-winning Ukrainian director Mstyslav Chernov for “2000 Meters to Andriivka” respectively.

There was the usual hand-wringing about a lack of commercially minded movies on the slate, and a dearth of big sales. And there were more existential questions as well. Would the festival continue to be held in Park City at all? The nonprofit institute that has organized this starry event in this small mountain town had declared that it was looking at alternative locations to ease congestion and crowding. The contender cities? Salt Lake City, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati. That shortlist provided constant fodder for conversation, and threatened to overwhelm the typical amiable pre-screening chatter about the actual program of films. Despite all the angst, Lisa Wong Macabasco and I found a handful of arresting indie movies to recommend.

We’ll also be posting longer reviews and sharing trailers, and you can follow along here to keep up with all of the news out of the festival.', '', 'CHARLES PULLIAM-MOORE', 'Between its dearth of new features and a couple of movies actually being pulled down, this year’s Sundance seemed a little feeble this past weekend, and Yahoo reports that those feelings are shared by producers who came away from the festival feeling that “independent film does not currently have a viable business model.“', '[YAHOO.COM]', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'An understated portrait of a life, oscillating between heartbreaking tragedy and hopeful beauty. The movie follows Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton) from his quiet vantage point in Idaho at the turn of the century. An orphan who eventually finds a successful career in logging, his largely lonely life is upended when he meets a woman (Felicity Jones) and, with her, finds a real reason to live. And yet Grainier finds that death seems to follow him wherever he goes. Eventually he loses everything — and spends the rest of his days trying to find that reason for being again.

Work is the only place he ever “meets” guys like Andrew (Russell Tovey) who make him wonder what his life might be like gay people weren’t forced to hide their identities. The more Lucas thinks about his future, the darker his anxieties become. A grim snapshot of the past, Plainclothes powerfully explores how normalized bigotry and state surveillance go hand-in-hand.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'The festival comes to a close today, and while there hasn’t been a particular standout film, there is plenty to keep an eye out for once they hit theaters and streaming services. You can keep up with everything we’ve watched so far right here, including the likes of Artropia, Zodiac Killer Project, and Bunnylovr. And expect more updates throughout the day.', 'CHARLES PULLIAM-MOORE', 'Twinless, writer / director / star James Sweeney’s dark comedy about two men (Sweeney, Dylan O’Brien) who bond after the death of their twins, was screening at in-person and online as part this year’s Sundance Film Festival. But Variety reports that the film has been yanked from the festival’s digital portal because people couldn’t stop recording clips and posting them to social media.', 'CHARLES PULLIAM-MOORE', 'With cicadas swarming Baltimore in the summer of 1987, ASCII artist Connor (Albert Birney) is even more inclined to stay home playing games on his Macintosh. At first, Obex doesn’t seem like much compared to any of the other floppy disk games he has ordered through the mail. But when his dog Sandy vanishes one day, the game’s fantasy world of monsters and magic starts to consume his mind. The film’s experimental, lo-fi depiction of pre-internet screen addiction is imaginative and artful. The story’s a bit thin, but its visuals are strong.', 'CHARLES PULLIAM-MOORE', 'Aimless twentysomething Becca (Katarina Zhu) doesn’t know what she wants out of life, but everyone wants a piece of her. Her sickly gambling addict father William (Perry Wang), her best friend (Rachel Sennott), and men like John (Austin Amelio) she does camshows for all see her time and attention as things they should be able to demand without question. It’s hard for her to say no, but when she unexpectedly receives a pet rabbit, the responsibility pushes her to start pushing back. Writer / director / star Zhu delivers a tremendous, but quiet performance that mirrors the film’s nuanced ideas about intimacy.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'This incredibly meta story isn’t strictly about the Zodiac Killer, but rather a failed attempt to make a documentary. After director Charlie Shackleton lost the rights to adapt the book The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up, he decided to make a movie that shows what the film would have been like. It plays out like an extended director’s commentary for a movie that doesn’t actually exist. The result is a surprisingly compelling story on its own, but also one that serves as a clever deconstruction of true crime, and a very open look at the editorial decisions that shape the genre.', 'CHARLES PULLIAM-MOORE', 'In the fictional country of Atropia (which is actually a training facility in California styled to resemble an Iraqi village), few people take their jobs as seriously as struggling actress Fayruz (Alia Shawkat). She knows there’s something twisted about roleplaying as a chemical weapons expert for the benefit of soldiers visiting Atropia before they’re deployed to fight in the real, ongoing Iraq War. But it’s a paying gig where she happens to be falling in love with a fellow pretend insurgent (Callum Turner). Though Atropia gets unwieldy between its romantic and satirical modes, it nails the Bush era’s “patriotic” madness.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'This film is gorgeous, taking place across a warm and cozy Paris, ultra modern Chongqing, and a virtual reality metaverse where players hunt down a mysterious, mystical deer. Unfortunately its parallel stories of estranged families aren’t particularly compelling on their own, nor do they intersect in a satisfying way. It attempts to throw in some tension through other means – like a surprisingly simple million-dollar art heist, and the search for the virtual deer – but ultimately Luz is too meandering to remain captivating for long.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'Set in an unnamed, fictional European country that, due to a long war where residents only had cabbage to eat, has outlawed the vegetable and imposed severe punishments for smugglers. When a honeymooning American couple (Himesh Patel and Sarah Goldberg) gets caught with cabbages in their pants, they end up racing for their lives. The movie is, obviously, ridiculous – and there are some fun comedic performances from Steven Yeun, Dave Franco, and Matt Berry – but it awkwardly tries to mash its humor with a more sincere tale of a couple facing their differences that never really comes together.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'It turns out Juliette Lewis makes a very good chair. In this surreal film her character Camille feels overlooked and ignored, until one day she finds the most beautiful designer chair, and the two somehow switch places. While Camille’s inanimate body becomes a strange source of fascination for her friends, she truly feels seen with her soul inside of the chair, which has become an obsession for pianist Olivier (Mamoudou Athie). The movie can drag in moments, particularly because of its lengthy narration, but its strange vision is weirdly charming and eventually pushes towards a surprisingly intense climax.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'A zombie apocalypse isn’t enough to stop Vinita’s (Kiran Deol) podcast ambitions. She hosts the titular show despite the world coming to an end, and a planned live performance for episode 100 becomes a useful way to connect with survivors, who are largely isolated in this dystopic world. Didn’t Die starts out as mostly a comedy, with the scary bits serving as background, but when Vinita’s ex and a surprise baby get involved, it becomes a touching –and tragic – story of family and loss, one that ends on a heartwarming and hopeful note.', 'ANDREW WEBSTER', 'A gorgeous adventure in the mold of E.T., the movie has a lot of promise but is missing the spark to truly stand out. It takes place in an isolated mountain community, where ape-like creatures called ochi are hunted by farmers trying to keep their livestock safe. But when a young girl (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby ochi, she sets off on a quest to return it to its family. The creature design is incredible, and there’s a lot of mystery to the post-apocalyptic seeming world. Ultimately, though, Ochi is a charming-yet-fairly-standard family-friendly adventure.

It all began in 2005, when I — freshly bat mitzvahed, and officially a woman — began following the exploits of Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), the show’s fictional superstar. I fell for the industry machinations (feuding studio execs! shattered box office records! agent hijinks!) almost as hard as I fell for Chase himself. (I mean, there’s a reason Ari Gold signed him off of a Mentos commercial...) And after the series set an entire episode at Sundance, the film festival became one of my chief interests, too.', 'In the two decades years since, I’ve played armchair Sundance participant. From the sidelines, I’ve coveted all the wintry fashion, and watched as festival premieres catapulted stars like Jennifer Lawrence into the spotlight. When festival favorites like The Wackness (2008) finally came out in theaters, I was first in line to see them.', 'So when Chase Sapphire invited me to attend the festival — 20 years after I saw the (not-at-all real, but totally real-to-me) movie Queens Boulevard premiere there on Entourage — I couldn’t wait to make my 12-year-old self’s dreams come true. Below, the highlights from my time in Park City.', 'Thursday, January 23', 'To kick things off, I attended the first premiere of the festival: Twinless. The film follows new friends Roman (Dylan O’Brien) and Dennis (the film’s writer and director, James Sweeney), who meet in a twin-loss bereavement group. While I’ll spare any further details — trust me, you’ll want to go in blind — suffice to say it’s a twisty, thoughtful meditation on isolation and grief, anchored by a career-best performance from O’Brien.', 'After the screening, I headed over to the Chase Sapphire Reserve Lounge on Main Street to celebrate with the cast. There, I found O’Brien and Sweeney rubbing shoulders with the film’s producers, Lauren Graham (who plays O’Brien’s mother in the film) hanging on a couch, and the supporting cast taking in the success of the premiere. But, for me, the real success was making it back to the hotel before midnight, which gave me plenty of time to rest up for the the next day’s events.', 'Friday, January 24', 'Trying to maintain a schedule at Sundance is a lot like playing a game of Jenga: If even one piece slides a touch out of place, all your carefully-laid plans may come tumbling down. On day two, I experienced this firsthand, when I booked a lunch too close to a screening of If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You, and missed my chance to see it. (A particular bummer, given how glowing the reviews have been for the Rose Byrne-starring, A24-produced indie.)', 'Luckily, things turned around when — after a few extra hours at my hotel, The St. Regis Deer Valley, an Edit property — I headed into town to check another item off my bucket list: meeting none other than Queen of Sundance herself, Lisa Barlow. Real Housewives of Salt Lake City fans know that, in some circles, there’s nobody more ubiquitous at Sundance than Barlow. Throughout her tenure on the show, Barlow’s made it clear there’s three things she loves more than all else: fast food, the festival, and herself. So when she invited me to come check out her Vida Tequila lounge, I felt like I’d been granted access her royal court. Once inside, Barlow and I spoke about the most recent Salt Lake City reunion (all off the record, I’m sorry to report) and chatted with John Barlow (her husband, and biggest fan).', 'After a half hour of basking in the glow of Baby Gorgeous (IYKYK), I headed back to the Chase Sapphire Reserve Lounge to attend the after party for Bubble & Squeak, ready to dance off my Vida Tequila shots.', 'Saturday, January 25', 'I’ve been a fan of Rachel Sennott’s ever since Shiva Baby. (No, not the 2021 feature that made her a star — the short version that premiered at SXSW in 2018.) So when I saw that she was coming to Sundance to debut Bunnylovr — Katarina Zhu’s directorial debut, which Sennott co-stars in and produced — I knew I had to make it to the premiere. And while I found the film to be one of the festival’s more polarizing offerings, everyone agreed on one thing: The snow bunny look Sennott wore to the after party was incredible, and very on-theme.', 'Sunday, January 26', 'Sunday was far and away my busiest day at the festival. I started early, with a breakfast at the UTA House, followed by another stop at the Chase Sapphire Reserve Lounge, where I decorated a cowboy hat at their “brim bar.” (“When in Rome” was my motto for the day, which also fueled my purchase of a cow hide rug later that afternoon.) After lunch, I went to a panel put on by the Onyx Collective in support of their upcoming Hulu show, Deli Boys. And between star Poorna Jagannathan’s gangster-inspired suiting, the show’s Pakistani mobster premise, and a surprise appearance from Tan France — who makes his scripted television debut in the series — the panel was one of the most rollicking half hours I spent in Utah.', 'The rest of my evening unfolded in a similarly high-octane fashion. I stopped by a Bookmarc pop-up (my favorite West Village bookstore, temporarily transported to Park City’s Main St.), attended a dinner at Chase Sapphire Reserve Presents Tavernetta (yet another pop-up experience), and even managed to get in some dancing at the Sundance Kiki party (I’d say more, but what happens at the Kiki stays at the Kiki).', 'The most surreal moment of my night, though, was a tipsy moment of solitude in the hotel’s furnicular. Sitting alone in the glass car, being transported hundreds of feet above the snow-covered property, I felt my Entourage dreams had finally come true.']"

This year’s lineup has so far been no different, showcasing films such as Sara Khaki’s ‘Cutting Through Rocks’ or Mathias Broe’s ‘Sauna.’ ', 'The series of films presented this year also had some recognizable names in the cast lists. Dylan Southern’s ‘The Thing with Feathers’ stars Benedict Cumberbatch in a masterful performance full of emotional and physical variety. He’s not the only very recognizable name appearing in films presented by the Sundance Film Festival, as Jennifer Lopez also appears playing a role in Bill Condon’s ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman.’ ', 'Other more well-known names seen in the films at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival include Olivia Coleman, Dylan O’Brien, Felicity Jones, Dev Patel and more. And many of these bigger names attended the premiere and starting events held as the festival began on Jan. 23. And this year, the festival, while showcasing these big names and returning directors, also worked to showcase debut films from 36 filmmakers.

Does Sundance Still Matter?,https://www.aol.com/does-sundance-still-matter-184308438.html,"['', '', 'At the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, there were movies that provoked their share of buzz and chatter and official breathless enthusiasm. But it’s fair to say that no movie this year generated half the conversation that Sundance did about itself. The buzz was all about the festival — which city it would move to in 2027 (Cincinnati or Boulder? The smart money is now on Cincinnati), as well as the question that’s been the backdrop of that move: Can Sundance, a festival that in the ’90s altered the very landscape of cinema, find a way to sustain its relevance into the 21st century?', 'The jury is very much out on that. Sundance still generates excitement and headlines, as well as a small handful of films that will have a chance to make an impact. But as much as I remain a Sundance believer, the festival’s mojo is increasingly shrouded in a fuzzy “We’re still here!” blitz of incandescent self-adoration.', 'More from Variety', ""'Sally' Review: Astronaut Sally Ride's Life Partner Shares the Personal Saga of the Public Icon"", ""'Magic Farm' Review: Acerbic Comedy About Culture Clash Follows Clueless Americans in Small-town Argentina"", ""'Dead Lover' Review: Macabre Attempt to Keep a Lost Romance Alive Is Both Entertaining and Inventive"", 'Even the reasons that Sundance is pulling up stakes are not all that widely understood. After 40 years, many of the denizens of Park City have grown weary of the festival. And the phenomenon of high-end skiing — vacation jaunts for the one percent — now actively competes with Sundance financially. Yet the meme that took hold, the one that I kept encountering in articles about Sundance, is that the festival has “outgrown” Park City. Really? That sounds to me like wish-fulfillment. And if Sundance has outgrown Park City, you would never know it from the diminishing vibes the festival generated this year.', 'In 2023, when Sundance first returned as an in-person event after the onset of the pandemic, it felt like a shadow of itself: a thinned-down, scaled-back festival. And a lingering vestige of that reality has persisted. I didn’t see the crowds on Main Street, the stalled traffic throughout Park City over the opening weekend, that I used to in the ’90s and 2000s. During the pandemic, the festival carried on by making its films available online, and that situation has continued in a modified version, with an online showcase of Sundance movies that’s made available starting midweek. So now, you can actually experience Sundance without attending it.', 'I watched several of the festival’s most talked-about movies this year online, after I’d returned home, and while that was certainly a convenience, what I didn’t expect, given how much I prize the theatrical experience, is how poetically right it felt. Of all the people who will ever watch any of the 100 or so features programmed at Sundance this year, the overwhelming majority will see them at home. And the truth is that most of the films fit all too snugly into the small screen.', 'What really struck me, though, is that in the age of streaming, when even the two or three most celebrated American independent films of the year — the ones that get nominated for multiple Oscars, like “The Brutalist” and “Anora” — have to work overtime to win a quarter-of-the-way decent-size audience in theaters, there are now, more than ever, two Sundance Film Festivals. There’s the one that takes place in Park City and will for one more year, where every film is greeted by audiences as if it were a life-changing event (the ovations, the reverence, the momentousness). And there’s the one beyond the Sundance bubble, where a handful of these movies will actually head out into the world and do…what? Fight for their lives as pieces of entertainment.', 'I’ve long been a religious believer in the Sundance Film Festival, but the yardstick of my devotion has been my conviction that the best films that emerge from Sundance matter because they’re able to find a real place in the real world. We saw that last year, I think, with “A Real Pain,” Jesse Eisenberg’s revelatory buddy movie. This year, there were a couple of times when I felt the old Sundance tingle, when I saw a movie so exceptional that I thought, “This has to work in the real world. It’s just too good to be ignored.”', 'One of those rare Sundance films this year was “Twinless,” the tale of a kinky and devious bromance-turned-love-triangle, and a comedy crafted with so much scalding, blissed-out, puckish delight that every scene in it feels like a gift. The film’s writer, director and co-star, James Sweeney, is a major talent who knows how to keep surprising the audience. And Dylan O’Brien, who plays both a swaggering gay lothario and his lunkish straight twin brother, emerges as a splendid actor and a total movie star. So does Aisling Franciosi, as the Christian receptionist who becomes the film’s surprise romantic foil. Sweeney, given the right resources, could make a rom-com that would have mainstream audiences lining up to see it. And maybe “Twinless” already is that movie.', 'There were three other dramatic features I saw that leapt out. “Lurker,” Alex Russell’s hypnotic tale of a geek who infiltrates the inner circle of a pop star, is a movie organized around the addictive lure of bad behavior. The title character, played by Théodore Pellerin, is a parasite for our time who will stop at nothing in his quest to stay close to fame. “Lurker” is super-charged and rivetingly suspenseful, a tasty parable of celebrity dreams in the age of social media.', 'Then there was “Ricky,” directed with blistering authenticity by Rashad Frett. The tale of a young man in East Hartford (the mesmerizing Stephan James) who gets out of prison after having spent half his 30 years there, it may be the most wrenching drama about an ex-offender trying to walk the line that I’ve seen since Dustin Hoffman in “Straight Time.” And “Peter Hujar’s Day” is Ira Sachs’ minimal but magical time-capsule leap back into the scruffy bohemian utopia of art, conversation and the meaning of life without technology.', 'But to return, for a moment, to my feeling that these movies are too good to be ignored: Is that a reality? A hope? Or a grand illusion? The great films of the 1970s, to invoke the period that the independent film revolution was in many ways a sequel to, were astonishing works of art, but they were not “message movies.” They embodied a social vision without preaching. And that’s true, for the most part, of what I think of as the great Sundance films — movies like “Reservoir Dogs” and “Memento” and “In the Bedroom” and “The Blair Witch Project” and “Welcome to the Dollhouse” and “Big Night” and “Chuck & Buck” and “I Shot Andy Warhol” and “Napoleon Dynamite” and “Secretary” and “Whiplash” and “Manchester by the Sea.” These were movies that didn’t make you feel like you had to be a responsible citizen to sit through them.', 'Too many of the Sundance films now fall into the trap of leading with their Big Message, which neuters their sense of dramatic danger. The filmmaking has become more insular, more preaching to the choir of social justice, in a way that one can totally agree with on a moral level yet still feel is overly earnest and limiting. I think you could sense the festival’s underlying anxiety about this phenomenon in its decision to program “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Bill Condon’s big-ticket adaptation of the 1992 stage musical, based on Manuel Puig’s novel (but really a variation on the famous 1985 movie). I had very mixed feelings about this film. It’s well-acted (by Diego Luna and Tonatiuh), with crisply deluxe neo-1950s musical numbers featuring Jennifer Lopez…until it descends into the endless muddle of its second half.', 'But the real question is: What was “Kiss of the Spider Woman” doing at Sundance? With a budget that, I’m guessing, exceeded $50 million, it has to have cost 12 times as much as just about any film there. It’s really an awards-bait movie. But the reason it was at Sundance was so that the festival could advertise its own relevance. It was the exception that proved the rule.', 'As a vehicle for launching independent films into the universe, Sundance remains the beautiful apparatus it always was. And I don’t expect that to change when it moves to a new city. Having voiced my own trepidation early on about this move, I now think — or at least a part of me does — that it could revitalize Sundance. (But oh, will I miss the thin-crust pizza at Davanza’s.) Moving forward, though, if Sundance is to remain relevant, both the programming and the movies that get made need to embrace a certain reality: that moviegoers today, maybe more than ever, want to be enthralled more than they want to be “enlightened.” There hardly needs to be a contradiction between those two things. But for Sundance to thrive into the future, it can’t just be the festival of films that are good for you that almost no one ends up seeing.', 'Best of Variety', ""'Anora,' 'Nosferatu,' 'Nickel Boys' and More Could Use DGA, PGA and WGA Noms for Big Boosts in Oscar Race"", ""SAG Awards Final Predictions: 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Pérez' and 'Wicked' Projected to Lead Nominations"", 'Final Oscar Predictions: Who Will Win and Should Win at the Academy Awards (ARCHIVE)', ""Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

The best films of Sundance 2025,https://www.avclub.com/best-films-sundance-2025,"['As Sundance 2025 gave us the weekend to continue watching films online after announcing its prizewinners, I took the opportunity to cram in some last-minute movies to my festival deep dive. Though many of the films covered in my dispatches from this year were middle-of-the-road, there was always the chance that a hidden gem was lurking on the Sundance app. After another few days spent on the couch, it’s time to declare the best films of Sundance 2025.', 'The awards ceremony for Sundance 2025, as it often does, highlighted a few deserving films (Life After, The Things You Kill) and plenty of mediocrity (Plainclothes, Ricky). Most of the best films from the festival were either overlooked or not eligible for prizes, making them less visible for those looking to headlines for guidance around what movies to add to their watchlist. That’s why The A.V. Club’s coverage is here, digging into the nasty Midnight gorefests, the truly worthy absurdities, and the riveting documentaries.', '', 'Below, you’ll find my favorites of the 43 features I saw at Sundance 2025, ranging from an elegiac story of the American West to a fairy tale where a woman chops off her own toes.', 'As soon as I saw the first frames of Train Dreams, I wondered if it’d be my favorite from the festival. Filmmaker Clint Bentley proved himself a capable actor’s director with his debut Jockey, which put Clifton Collins Jr. in the spotlight as a rode-hard-put-away-wet racer, but that film had little of Train Dreams’ visual power. Invested in capturing all the colors of the verdant Pacific Northwest, Bentley and cinematographer Adolpho Veloso light their film with sun and fire. Candles, camps, lamps, and forest fires shed their warm glow onto the ever-changing life of a logger (Joel Edgerton), who, over the course of this adaptation of Denis Johnson’s novella, watches the country change around him. Haunted by his flaws and the shifting 20th century all around him, the soft-spoken railroad man transports us back in time to a generation witnessing mindboggling technological transformations. In its quiet poetry, it reflects our present plight with Terrence Malick’s deep feelings and Kelly Reichardt’s wry interactions. Netflix has picked this one up, but this one’s too good to languish on a streamer.', '', 'One of the last movies I got a chance to watch at Sundance 2025 was one I couldn’t stop hearing about. Sorry, Baby took home the screenwriting award in the Dramatic competition, but it could’ve swept the category and I wouldn’t have raised an eyebrow. The feature debut from writer-director-star Eva Victor breaks a student turned professor’s life into chapters, doling out her life in nonchronological chunks before, during, and after her sexual assault. As harrowing as that sounds, Sorry, Baby is definitely one of the funniest, most charming films about post-traumatic dissociation and recovery I’ve ever seen. Victor’s performance as Agnes threads the needle not just in regards to her fragile psyche, but with clever dialogue and a tightknit relationship with her best friend (Naomi Ackie). Mannered deliveries and specific, jokey ways of acting around your closest friends can easily feel false in movies. Victor walks the tightrope perfectly, using the world of academia to further justify her characters’ sorta-heightened reality. They’re obviously in a bubble, but that bubble still feels real. Add in a few crushing filmmaking choices around the film’s most intense moments and a couple scene-stealing supporters (John Carroll Lynch!), and you’ve got a wave-making debut. I hope we’ll all be hearing a lot about Eva Victor.', 'Most of the documentaries at Sundance 2025 were harrowing watches. War, oppression, death, injustice. GEN_ isn’t treacle, but its focus is on a charming figure saying all the right things in a world where we’re used to the exact opposite. Gianluca Matarrese’s intimate look at the daily work done by Dr. Maurizio Bini at his Italian fertilization and gender-affirming care facility undermines any negative expectation. Bini simply affirms his patients’ needs, gets them the hormones they need, and reassures them that he’ll always go to bat for them. He even asks them to put him on the phone with their parents, if the parents aren’t on board. That makes for a film that’s an easy-to-like comfort, especially since it springs from the heart of a conservative Catholic country; when your subject is so charismatic and compassionate (especially considering that Bini is an old man whose values have clearly evolved), your film already starts life on third base. But Matarrese’s minimalist stylistic approach, with tight close-ups and intentionally obscured frames, brings us even closer to these offices and invests us even further in their successes.', 'The Things You Kill doesn’t give too many signs about the head-rattling it’s about to dole out amid its family drama. Shot against stark deserts and looming mountains, Iranian filmmaker Alireza Khatami’s slick and cerebral film starts spinning apart in the aftermath of its matriarch’s death. Was the elderly woman’s death really just the result of natural causes? And can, or should, anything be done depending on the answer to that question? As her son (Ekin Koç) grapples with these lingering doubts, impotence and violence—two terrifying poles of threatened masculinity—threaten to pull him and the rest of the film’s men apart. Add in one mysterious gardener (Erkan Kolçak Köstendil), a few shocking bursts of style, and an increasingly blurry line between sweaty dreams and the cold reality of day, and The Things You Kill becomes an arresting fable.', 'An fist-clenching comparison between community action and the gun-happy police state, The Perfect Neighbor unfolds its nightmarish true-crime through the body-cam language of Cops. In a low-income Florida neighborhood, an older white lady is a known menace whose racism lashes out of her in frightening outbursts and endless calls to law enforcement. Each time, the cops show up, back up her Black neighbors and their children (who are always the target of the white woman’s ire), and do…nothing. Of course, without repercussions, things are going to get much worse. As the film’s horrors wear on, its upsetting and explicit access drive its points into the pit of your stomach. Stand-your-ground laws, gun ownership, the ineffectiveness of police even when they’re doing everything “right” (because this body-cam footage wouldn’t exist if they thought they were doing something “wrong”)—all this and more weighs heavy throughout the tough watch. It leaves you angry and cold, like so many films and news stories about so much needless death in this country.', 'Though it initially presents as a standard-issue Sundance Film, with a sun-dappled aesthetic and a few indie-gem stories about small-town life, Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake) is both specific enough in scope and loving enough in detail to stand out as a skilled debut. Filmmaker Sierra Falconer connects four small stories into her sharply observed community anthology, all centered around lake folks and the dreams that bubble under their placid surfaces. The first two stories are strongest and most focused, but the latter two still contain winning moments. Throughout, Falconer finds honesty in her characters. There’s almost a Stephen King-like sense of community to the lake town Falconer has painted, the tourists and townies alike having real relationships with each other and the water itself. Though it can be a little uneven, as any anthology is, Sunfish & Other Stories On Green Lake is a bright and varied short-story collection, and an impressive showcase for a filmmaker operating in multiple modes over the course of this streamlined tour around the lake.', 'Georgian filmmaker Dea Kulumbegashvili’s Medusa-like abortion drama April is a medical, cultural horror movie. You stare, turned to stone by the film’s unwavering gaze. A brutal, sometimes literally monstrous tale of an obstetrician (Ia Sukhitashvili) who moonlights giving illegal small-town abortions, April lingers on unrelentingly uncomfortable images—including those of actual childbirth. Its slow pace, quiet perseverance, and unflinching camera construct an oppressive atmosphere reflective of a woman’s place in this controlling society. Under fire from every corner, Sukhitashvili relishes in small rebellions but rarely lets anything through her steely surface as she lurches through a world that loathes her. As she offers a modicum of freedom and autonomy to the women around her, she also attempts to steal a bit for herself where she can—leading her to riskier and riskier places, and warping her self-perception into something ghoulish.', 'Norwegian filmmaker Emilie Blichfeldt sits body-horror geeks down for the world’s most upsetting bedtime story in her adaptation of Cinderella. Focusing on The Ugly Stepsister, her horror film puts Elvira (Lea Myren) through her paces as it brings the beauty industry into a medieval dungeon. Noses and toeses are brutalized by the nasty film’s inventive purveyors of pain, as Elvira gets herself done up for the prince’s upcoming ball. Of course, she doesn’t look better as she suffers, bleeds, and pukes all over the movie. She looks like she’s gone through hell. But isn’t that what it takes to keep up with the lords of the neighboring castle? In this blistering, squirm-inducing satire of beauty standards, a fairy tale period aesthetic gets very, very juicy. Not for the faint of heart, it’s a gross-out good time for the rest of us. ', 'Another film that’s not going to be for everyone, Amanda Kramer’s surreal tale of a meek woman (Juliette Lewis) who swaps bodies with a really nice chair is built to bounce people off. But beyond this oddball premise is a well-appointed and intentionally theatrical daydream that wonders whether the world treats a nice chair better than a human woman (a question everyone knows the answer to). Even in its most over-the-top and stagey moments, in one-sided conversations with a now-soulless Lewis’ slumped and motionless body and in interpretive dances, By Design captures real feelings in unreal ways. There’s yearning and need driving this desire to become furniture—and yes, it gets horny for those wondering if the submissive subtext ever breaches the surface—and pain at its core. Mamoudou Athie, who plays a man obsessed with the chair-lady (not the lady-chair), explores another angle of this adrift need in a great “normal ’til it’s not” performance. Kramer bolsters this strange relationship with an ‘80s-inflected aesthetic—gauzy crossfades through pastel rooms, each suffused with the visual hallmarks of softcore erotica—and aggressive artificiality. By Design can definitely skew into the annoyingly kooky side of things, but often the weirdness all clicks into place to find amusement and poignancy in equal measure.', 'A sadly relevant documentary for a nation increasingly, virulently hostile to trans people, Heightened Scrutiny tags along as ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio prepares to argue United States v. Skrmetti in front of the Supreme Court. Sam Feder’s intimate film follows the groundbreaking lawyer during his research and practice, but more compellingly offers up a massive collection of talking heads who make the case that mainstream media publications like The Atlantic and the New York Times are directly to blame for stoking the fires of transphobia. By breaking down the “opinion piece to judicial citation” pipeline, with evidence that, within a week of publication, some of these anti-trans screeds are being read and used to back up the opinions of judges and lawyers alike in courtrooms around the country, Heightened Scrutiny highlights how the legal system is only a small part of what this community has to deal with—and how that system often cares more about other factors than the actual law. Amid these infuriating testimonials stands solidarity, friendship, and community. Strangio makes his case at the highest court in the land, but also supports those protesting his local school board.

He left his young children and wife in the ‘70s, and now his grown daughter Hannah (an equally compelling Olivia Colman, 51), a filmmaker, visits him in Amsterdam, bent on making a movie “without conflict,” about her parents’ seemingly accepting and affirming relationship. But conflicts may arise, especially since Hannah’s non-binary child Frances (Aud Mason-Hyde) hopes to remain with Grandpa Jim (“Jimpa” as he likes to be called) in Amsterdam once the parents return home to Australia. It’s a very personal, partly autobiographical work from Sophie Hyde, whose grownup sexual awakening film Good Luck to You, Leo Grande (2022) was such a delight.  Jimpa has its over-earnest moments. But Lithgow is so aglow here as a difficult man that, like his friends and family, we make allowances.  ', 'In the late sixties and early seventies, Sly Stone (née Sylvester Stewart), 81, and his Family Stone were a comet ablaze. Documentarian Questlove, 54, has thrilling archival footage and savvy interviewees like Living Color guitar maestro Vernon Reid, 66, and D’Angelo, 50 sharing wisdom. The clips of Sly in his Bay area deejay days, at Woodstock, and on The Mike Douglas Show depict an innovator lit from within. In his druggy decline, he was just lit. With his gender-diverse, mixed-race ensemble, and funk-infused anthems of inclusion like “Stand!,” “Family Affair” and “I Want to Take You Higher,” Sly is an obvious precursor to Prince. “Sing a Simple Song,” sang Sly. This is a deep dive into the man — a not-so-simple song.', 'Marlee Matlin, 59, the first deaf actor to win an Oscar (best actress for 1986’s Children of a Lesser God), costarred with the second, Troy Kotsur, 56, in 2022’s CODA. The events of her life, told in this engaging PBS American Masters documentary, have a celebrity tell-a-lot familiarity: her affair with Children leading man William Hurt; his alleged abuse; her becoming sober. But it’s striking the way Matlin and director Shoshannah Stern (who is also deaf) relate the actor’s life as a groundbreaker, an accidental and then intentional advocate, shifting between captions, speech and the sounds and potent silences that accompany American Sign Language.

Min makes a proposal (two, actually) that sends this reprise of Ang Lee’s successful 1993 romantic comedy into a whirlwind of subterfuge, laughs and lunacy. The young actors have an enjoyable chemistry. But the film deepens mightily once Minari’s Oscar-winning Youn Yuh-jung, 77, arrives as Min’s no-nonsense grandmother, proving once again why she’s a legend in Korea and should become one here.  ', 'The audience gave this quiet drama about a rancher who loses all when a Colorado wildfire ravages a wooded valley a sustained standing ovation that got loudest for star Josh O’Connor (Challengers). He plays Dusty, a divorced father living in a small outcrop of FEMA trailers along with other victims of the blaze. Where will they go? Rebuilding unfolds with clear-eyed care, and feels like a rooted rebuff to the sudsy melodrama of Yellowstone.', 'The sick child in this dark comedy-drama has a bleating voice only a mother could love. Even then, Linda is driven to her limits. Rose Byrne gives a performance for the ages as an exhausted mom and cratering therapist who cannot heal herself. Conan O’Brien, 61, portrays Linda’s shrink.

She knew that the story of Gibson’s diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and the way they and their wife, Megan Falley, were navigating early death, was as affirming as it was rending.

A Malickian period piece and so-so Dramatic Competition entries round out Sundance 2025,https://www.avclub.com/sundance-2025-reviews-train-dreams-twinless-bunnylovr-plainclothes-ricky,"['My final dispatch for Sundance 2025 is bolstered by finally having access to a large swath of films from the festival that were only made available for folks covering it remotely on Wednesday. Among those films were most of the U.S. Dramatic Competition lineup. Of that selection, the lovely anthology Sunfish (& Other Stories On Green Lake) made my list of most anticipated movies for the fest, while I noted that the ho-hum romance Love, Brooklyn coasts by on its talented cast in my last write-up. Many of the other films in this section err towards the latter, but going through all the new movies at my disposal uncovered one gem that cinephiles should be looking forward to for the rest of the year.', 'Train Dreams (B+), a Premiere rather than a film vying for a Dramatic prize like the rest in this dispatch, marks a big step forward for filmmaker Clint Bentley. Bentley last directed the endearing but formulaic character study Jockey, which gave standout character actor Clifton Collins Jr. his due at Sundance in 2021, and recently earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the prison drama Sing Sing. Train Dreams is a different animal than both, a thoroughly engrossing period piece of dreamy details. Adapted from Denis Johnson’s novella, the story of one man’s lifetime—ranging an absurd technological expanse, from constructing the railroads of the West to witnessing televised spaceflight—is quietly told, in conversation with Kelly Reichardt and Terrence Malick.', '', 'Train Dreams was recently picked up by Netflix, but it deserves a big-screen release. The leap that life takes a simple logger (Joel Edgerton) over the course of a single generation stands in for that inevitable left-behind feeling that creeps up with age, here inspiring awe rather than pissy fist-shaking at the changing times. The whole film is awestruck, this potentially cloying tone justified by a devotion to golden hour nature photography, candlelight and campfires, and production design (courtesy of After Yang’s Alexandra Schaller) that transports you as deeply as the untamed forests. Edgerton’s soft-spoken woodsman embodies this observational perspective, though wry voiceover and some choice bit players (William H. Macy steals the show as the incredibly named Arn Peeples) add a bit more edge to the affair. ', 'As he works the land and loves his family (Felicity Jones winningly plays his wife), the world turns, its cruelties and inspirations raining down in equal measure. It’s a film that filters a familiar sensation—that as soon as you finally get comfortable doing something, it’s obsolete or not long for this world—through a detailed time period and profession. Its protagonist isn’t just haunted by universal regrets, wishing for more time with his loved ones, but by the pointed cruelties of his era. Train Dreams is about things coming to an end just as you finally start figuring them out, and how that lamentable phenomenon affects not just individuals, but nations and cultures. And, just as the grasses begin poking through the ashes of a forest fire, the ones coming after us have nothing else to do but start the cycle over again.', '', 'Focused on the vicious cycle of imprisonment, parole, and reoffence, Ricky (C) inelegantly makes its case about the struggles of a recently released 30-year-old. Rashad Frett’s jittery feature debut is ironically more intent on punishing Ricky (Stephan James) than giving him a chance. Rather than understanding the stunted man at its center—having been locked up for 15 years, half his life was spent in jail—or those around him (mostly one-note women), the frantic handheld camera is dead-set on James’ physical tics of discomfort or the plot machinations that conspire against him.', 'Frett and co-writer Lin Que Ayoung plant the realistic seeds of post-incarceration life as an impractical series of bureaucratic nightmares, but can’t resist throwing some juicier (and more illogical) dramatic turns at their central character. Ricky, a man left behind by technology, by puberty, by his family, by his community, has plenty of built-in problems the film merely nods to. Rather than investing in these small, mounting obstacles and the domino effect they have on a life that must be lived according to strict rules set by an uncaring system, Ricky introduces big blowups followed by bigger monologues. It’s a blunt approach for a film that’s best when investing in the day-to-day textures and pain points experienced by someone in Ricky’s shoes.', 'On the other side of the law (kind of) is Plainclothes (C), which sees Tom Blyth play an undercover cop whose job somehow consists entirely of entrapping men cruising for sex at a ‘90s New York mall. When he falls for one of his would-be victims (Russell Tovey), the film becomes a gay tragedy brought to its knees by writer-director Carmen Emmi’s unrelenting stylistic futzing. Neither Blyth nor Tovey (both Englishmen) look or sound like they fit into the well-constructed period setting, but this is overwhelmed by Plainclothes’ formal aesthetic.', 'The editing is constantly in motion. The film utilizes format changes for things like memories—like grainy home movies—and when Blyth’s POV goes into predatory police officer mode—taking on a zoomed, security cam-like view. Aspect ratios bounce back and forth incessantly. In moderation or with a strict level of control, these factors could enhance (or at least reflect) the closeted cop’s compartmentalized perspective. Instead, as the film develops from an icky “homophobic cops are probably just queer” shorthand to a more nuanced and upsetting place, these stylistic choices take you out of the anxious headspace rather than imprisoning you inside it.', 'As the film moves back in forth in time and location—the latter seesawing between the pair’s discreet hookups and the cop’s jam-packed, Christmas Eve In Miller’s Point-style family gatherings (Maria Dizzia also stars in this one as a harried mom)—it muddles its lead’s painful trajectory and how damaging it’s been to conceal this part of him. Blyth sometimes goes as broad as the rest of the film to convey this eroding ache, but Tovey (playing a more seasoned closeted man) is often stunning as his self-protective foil.', 'Foils abound in James Sweeney’s ridiculous Twinless (B-), where dark comedy springs up from the death of an identical twin. An excellent Dylan O’Brien plays a dual role as gay hotshot Rocky and straight dimwit Roman…at least, he does until Rocky gets plastered by a passing truck. At a support group for those who’ve lost twins, Roman meets Denis (Sweeney), who reminds him of his brother and offers him a surrogate second half that he’s adrift without. A few twists and turns later, and Twinless becomes catty gay erotica just clever enough to pull off its sillier ideas.', 'O’Brien is the real selling point of the charming low-key film, his understated turn as Roman balancing out his scenery-gobbling costars and providing some gut-laughs as an oblivious schlub. As writer-director, Sweeney injects his sophomore effort with some amusing visual gags, coordinated costumes, and a look that’s far more thoughtful than your run-of-the-mill comedy, not to mention a handful of good punchlines. As an actor, though, he can seem a little lost when not delivering snippy zingers or long writerly monologues. Surrounding himself with O’Brien and Aisling Franciosi (endearingly cheery) only emphasizes the difference during the film’s more earnest moments. But Twinless does have a heart underneath its zany concept. That emotional core powers its Cut-cover-story-like confidence, which watches one bad choice snowball catastrophically and absurdly through several half-lived lives.', 'Bunnylovr (C-) is another film from a writer-director-star, watching off-handedly as Katarina Zhu plays a cam girl aimlessly dinking around New York. Zhu’s dreary drama contains plenty of specific screenplay threads, ranging from the idiosyncratic (a creepy client sends her a rabbit to care for, then torture) to the painfully generic (an estranged dying dad; an annoying friend played, per the New York Indie Film Mandate, by Rachel Sennott). All of them, though, are basically ignored in favor of the dullest version of big-city ennui.', 'With half-assed symbolism and an attention span too short to actually examine any of its topics—including the mundane realities of sex work—Bunnylovr’s narrative episodes blur into a familiar haze. Zhu never finds much of a character to play, nor much of a world for that character to live in, but those rare moments that actually do feel real, like a crowded mass of Chinatown gamblers, offer a flash of color amid the tedium.', '', 'GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.', '', 'Sign Up', '', '', '', '', '', '© 2025 Paste Media Group.

Does Sundance Still Matter?,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/does-sundance-still-matter-184308636.html,"['', '', '', '', '', 'At the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, there were movies that provoked their share of buzz and chatter and official breathless enthusiasm. But it’s fair to say that no movie this year generated half the conversation that Sundance did about itself. The buzz was all about the festival — which city it would move to in 2027 (Cincinnati or Boulder? The smart money is now on Cincinnati), as well as the question that’s been the backdrop of that move: Can Sundance, a festival that in the ’90s altered the very landscape of cinema, find a way to sustain its relevance into the 21st century?', 'The jury is very much out on that. Sundance still generates excitement and headlines, as well as a small handful of films that will have a chance to make an impact. But as much as I remain a Sundance believer, the festival’s mojo is increasingly shrouded in a fuzzy “We’re still here!” blitz of incandescent self-adoration.', 'More from Variety', ""'Sugar Babies' Review: A Louisiana TikToker Hopes to Flirt Her Way Out of Poverty in a Surface-Level Portrait"", ""'Enigma' Review: A Fascinating Portrait of Two Trailblazing Transgender Legends"", ""Sundance Pulls 'Twinless' From Digital Platform After Major Online Leaks, Including Dylan O'Brien Sex Scenes"", 'Even the reasons that Sundance is pulling up stakes are not all that widely understood. After 40 years, many of the denizens of Park City have grown weary of the festival. And the phenomenon of high-end skiing — vacation jaunts for the one percent — now actively competes with Sundance financially. Yet the meme that took hold, the one that I kept encountering in articles about Sundance, is that the festival has “outgrown” Park City. Really? That sounds to me like wish-fulfillment. And if Sundance has outgrown Park City, you would never know it from the diminishing vibes the festival generated this year.', 'In 2023, when Sundance first returned as an in-person event after the onset of the pandemic, it felt like a shadow of itself: a thinned-down, scaled-back festival. And a lingering vestige of that reality has persisted. I didn’t see the crowds on Main Street, the stalled traffic throughout Park City over the opening weekend, that I used to in the ’90s and 2000s. During the pandemic, the festival carried on by making its films available online, and that situation has continued in a modified version, with an online showcase of Sundance movies that’s made available starting midweek. So now, you can actually experience Sundance without attending it.', 'I watched several of the festival’s most talked-about movies this year online, after I’d returned home, and while that was certainly a convenience, what I didn’t expect, given how much I prize the theatrical experience, is how poetically right it felt. Of all the people who will ever watch any of the 100 or so features programmed at Sundance this year, the overwhelming majority will see them at home. And the truth is that most of the films fit all too snugly into the small screen.', 'What really struck me, though, is that in the age of streaming, when even the two or three most celebrated American independent films of the year — the ones that get nominated for multiple Oscars, like “The Brutalist” and “Anora” — have to work overtime to win a quarter-of-the-way decent-size audience in theaters, there are now, more than ever, two Sundance Film Festivals. There’s the one that takes place in Park City and will for one more year, where every film is greeted by audiences as if it were a life-changing event (the ovations, the reverence, the momentousness). And there’s the one beyond the Sundance bubble, where a handful of these movies will actually head out into the world and do…what? Fight for their lives as pieces of entertainment.', 'I’ve long been a religious believer in the Sundance Film Festival, but the yardstick of my devotion has been my conviction that the best films that emerge from Sundance matter because they’re able to find a real place in the real world. We saw that last year, I think, with “A Real Pain,” Jesse Eisenberg’s revelatory buddy movie. This year, there were a couple of times when I felt the old Sundance tingle, when I saw a movie so exceptional that I thought, “This has to work in the real world. It’s just too good to be ignored.”', 'One of those rare Sundance movies was “Twinless,” the tale of a kinky and devious bromance-turned-love-triangle, and a comedy crafted with so much scalding, blissed-out, puckish delight that every scene in it feels like a gift. The film’s writer, director and co-star, James Sweeney, is a major talent who knows how to keep surprising the audience. And Dylan O’Brien, who plays both a swaggering gay lothario and his lunkish straight twin brother, emerges as a splendid actor and a total movie star. So does Aisling Franciosi, as the Christian receptionist who becomes the film’s surprise romantic foil. Sweeney, given the right resources, could make a rom-com that would have mainstream audiences lining up to see it. And maybe “Twinless” already is that movie.', 'There were three other dramatic features I saw that leapt out. “Lurker,” Alex Russell’s hypnotic tale of a geek who infiltrates the inner circle of a pop star, is a movie organized around the addictive lure of bad behavior. The central character, played by Théodore Pellerin, is a gadfly for our time who will stop at nothing in his quest to stay close to fame. “Lurker” is super-charged and rivetingly suspenseful, a tasty parable of celebrity dreams in the age of social media.', 'Then there’s “Ricky,” directed with blistering authenticity by Rashad Frett. It’s the tale of a young man in East Hartford (the mesmerizing Stephan James) who gets out of prison after having spent half his 30 years there, and it may be the most wrenching drama about an ex-offender trying to walk the line that I’ve seen since Dustin Hoffman in “Straight Time.” And “Peter Hujar’s Day” is Ira Sachs’ minimal but magical time-capsule leap back into the scruffy bohemian utopia of art, conversation and the meaning of life without technology.', 'But to return, for a moment, to my feeling that these movies are too good to be ignored: Is that a reality? A hope? Or a grand illusion? The great films of the 1970s, to invoke the period that the independent film revolution was in many ways a sequel to, were astonishing works of art, but they were not “message movies.” They embodied a social vision without preaching. And that’s true, for the most part, of what I think of as the great Sundance films — movies like “Reservoir Dogs” and “Memento” and “In the Bedroom” and “The Blair Witch Project” and “Welcome to the Dollhouse” and “Big Night” and “Chuck & Buck” and “I Shot Andy Warhol” and “Secretary” and “Whiplash” and “Manchester by the Sea.” These were movies that didn’t make you feel like you had to be a responsible citizen to sit through them.', 'Too many of the Sundance films now fall into the trap of leading with their Big Message, which neuters their sense of dramatic danger. The filmmaking has become more insular, more preaching to the choir of social justice, in a way that one can totally agree with on a moral level yet still feel is overly earnest and limiting. I think you could sense the festival’s ambivalence about this phenomenon in its decision to program “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Bill Condon’s big-ticket adaptation of the 1992 stage musical, based on Manuel Puig’s novel (but really a variation on the famous 1985 movie). I had very mixed feelings about this film. It’s well-acted (by Diego Luna and Tonatiuh), with crisply deluxe neo-1950s musical numbers featuring Jennifer Lopez…until it descends into the endless muddle of its second half.', 'But the real question is: What was “Kiss of the Spider Woman” doing at Sundance? With a budget that, I’m guessing, exceeded $50 million, it has to have cost 12 times as much as just about any film there. It’s really an awards-bait movie. But the reason it was at Sundance was so that the festival could advertise its own relevance. It was the exception that proved the rule.', 'As a vehicle for launching independent films into the universe, Sundance remains the beautiful apparatus it always was. And I don’t expect that to change when it moves to a new city. Having voiced my own trepidation early on about this move, I now think — or at least a part of me does — that it could revitalize Sundance. (But oh, will I miss the thin-crust pizza at Davanza’s.) Moving forward, though, if Sundance is to remain relevant, both the programming and the movies that get made need to embrace a certain reality: that moviegoers today, maybe more than ever, want to be enthralled more than they want to be “enlightened.” There hardly needs to be a contradiction between those two things. But for Sundance to thrive into the future, it can’t just be the festival of films that are good for you that almost no one ends up seeing.', 'Best of Variety', ""'Anora,' 'Nosferatu,' 'Nickel Boys' and More Could Use DGA, PGA and WGA Noms for Big Boosts in Oscar Race"", ""SAG Awards Final Predictions: 'Conclave,' 'Emilia Pérez' and 'Wicked' Projected to Lead Nominations"", 'Final Oscar Predictions: Who Will Win and Should Win at the Academy Awards (ARCHIVE)', ""Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Meet the 12 Sundance Breakouts Everyone Will Be Talking About,https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/2025-sundance-breakout-filmmakers-stars-1235090613/,"['', 'At its heart, Sundance is about discovery. Some of our brightest, biggest filmmaking stars — we’re talking Steven Soderbergh, Richard Linklater, Ava DuVernay, Paul Thomas Anderson, Lulu Wang, Ryan Coogler, Aubrey Plaza, Catherine Hardwicke, Todd Haynes, Tessa Thompson, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Eggers, the Duplass brothers, Michael B. Jordan, Amy Adams, Elizabeth Olsen, Brie Larson, Lakeith Stanfield, Miles Teller, Anya Taylor-Joy, and many, many more — first rose to acclaim by bringing their work to Sundance.', '', 'In 2025, a year that was long-heralded as one all about new discoveries, that tradition only continued. While this year’s lineup included a number of returning names, like Ira Sachs, Amy Berg, Andrew Ahn, Justin Lin, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, Cooper Raiff, Kahlil Joseph, Heidi Ewing & Rachel Grady, David France, Jesse Short Bull, Ryan White, Sophie Hyde, Jesse Moss & Amanda McBaine, Meera Menon, and Clint Bentley, there were also a hefty number of newbies joining those filmmaking ranks. The 2025 program was composed of 36 of 87 (41 percent) feature film directors who are first-time feature filmmakers.', '', 'And that’s just the filmmakers! Each film and series also included a wide range of stars, including a number of brand-new talents making their debut at Sundance (or, heck, just making their debut). Every year, we turn to Sundance to introduce us to the bright talents we need to know now. This year: we’ve got a dozen to share with you.', 'David Ehrlich and Ryan Lattanzio also contributed to this story.', 'If you were unlucky enough to catch me in the early, dehydrated, incredibly headachy days (daze?) of this year’s festival, I likely used all the coherent words left in my arsenal to sing the praises of Eva Victor’s staggering feature film debut, “Sorry, Baby.” And, yes, I may have already been back on a plane to NYC when the film actually premiered at the Eccles on Monday night, but I couldn’t help but feel the absolute joy oozing out of everyone blessed enough to see this one with a big crowd as all the sparkling reviews and delighted social media posts poured in. I love being right, but even more than that, I love a film world in which Victor’s film can emerge as the discovery of the festival.', '', 'Describing the film’s plot is a bit thorny, and points to whoever wrote the extremely concise logline for the film (“Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on… for everyone around her, at least”). It would be hard to accurately convey the power and potency of Victor’s debut, a darkly funny and enormously tender film, with just two sentences, but we promise there’s plenty wrapped in those 15 short words.', 'Yes, the film is about what happens after the worst occurs, but with plenty of room to weave the light next to the dark. Something bad happens to Agnes, but Victor is a wise enough creator to understand that’s only part of the story, because that’s only part of life itself. And while Victor’s film might be rooted specifically in Agnes’ story and the bad thing at its center, in its specificity, there’s still tremendous room for wider recognition and revelation. Part comedy, part drama, part horror film, this incredibly accomplished debut announces the arrival of a huge star both in front of and behind the camera. —KE', '“Straight Up” director James Sweeney swears he has not read reviews for his mordantly funny second feature, the darker-than-you’d-expect queer comedy “Twinless,” which earned raves upon its opening night Eccles premiere. Sweeney writes, directs, and stars in the film as Dennis, a conniving Portland twink who strikes up a bromance with Dylan O’Brien after infiltrating a support group for people who’ve lost their twin siblings. Sweeney’s performance is not only impressive on its own oddball terms, but “Twinless” is striking for how bleak it’s willing to go, especially as Roman’s (O’Brien) equally damaged psyche starts to emerge.', '', 'Sweeney also directs O’Brien to a hilariously flamboyant turn as Roman’s gay twin Rocky, with whom Dennis had a brief but, it turns out, dangerously haunting fling. The setup of “Twinless” spells a recipe for disaster literally from frame one, but Sweeney demonstrates complete control over material that, even at this early stage in his career, I don’t think could have been made by anyone else. —RL ', 'Few rising performers would be up to the task of starring in a big-budget movie musical alongside one of our last true contemporary divas (Jennifer Lopez) and the bonafide can-do-anything gem that is Diego Luna, but Tonatiuh does not only that in Bill Condon’s “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” but also nearly steals the show out from both of them.', 'The mononym star, known for the TV series “Vida” and “Promised Land” and last year’s Netflix streaming smash “Carry-On,” “gives an earnestly star-making performance as the flamboyant and reverie-prone Luis, restoring the tale’s Latin American roots after William Hurt played him to an Oscar win in 1986,” we noted in our review. The actor’s layered performance, teetering between sweet and steely, heartbroken and heartbreaking, is a highlight of the film that could have relied on its razzle-dazzle to carry it. Tonatiuh does that, and more. —KE', '', 'Danish filmmaker Mathias Broe explores the horny subcultures (including the gay “Sauna” of the title) thriving in Copenhagen with his stylishly directed, coming-of-sexual-age feature debut. This frank film follows gay man Johan (Magnus Juhl Andersen), an employee in a gay bathhouse who sparks a connection with a transgender man, William (Nina Terese Rask, who is trans-masculine and a popular Danish comedian). While delivering to audiences one of Denmark’s first trans leads in an indie movie, Broe has an eye for the explicitly gay particulars of intimacy in 2025: douching, strap-ons, party drugs, and debasing sex dungeons. But at the movie’s warm but not soft-edged center is the chemistry between the lead actors, who make for one of Sundance 2025’s best love stories. —RL ', 'Too often, pint-sized breakout stars need to go big, broad, and mercilessly precocious to capture eyeballs, but that’s not often the case at Sundance, where more reserved performances can shine, even with our youngest performers. Such is the case of Molly Belle Wright, who does extraordinarily heavy lifting in Cole Webley’s debut “Omaha,” which sees the young star ably playing both the soul of her broken family (including our perpetual fave John Magaro as her dad and the very cute Wyatt Solis as her younger brother) and the mind of the audience itself.', '', 'It’s early morning when we meet them: Dad (Magaro), Ella (Wright), and Charlie (Solis). They’re going on a trip, but only Dad knows that, and when he carefully plucks his kids out of their warm beds and packs them into the car, it’s hard to imagine he’s doing it in service to a trip to Disneyland or anywhere else warm or fun. “Pretend that there’s a fire,” he tells his eldest, the wise-beyond-her-years Ella, as she dithers over what to pack. Ella’s initial confusion and worry will be well-founded, but as the family travels through the American West in pursuit of a secret location and a secret mission, it’s Wright who guides it, who holds it steady, who breaks our hearts. —KE', 'It’s no surprise that Bronx home-towner Joel Alfonso Vargas will soon take his NEXT premiere “Mad Bills to Pay (or Destiny, dile que no soy malo)” to the Berlinale after Sundance. With eight short film credits under his belt prior to this bracing feature debut, Vargas is an uncommonly confident filmmaker for someone just starting out, and with a specific vision to match.', 'Here, he writes and directs a New York summer party movie on its surface that starts spinning out as Rico (Juan Collado) and his girlfriend Destiny (Destiny Checo) clash with his family at home. “Mad Bills to Pay” has an improvisatory energy despite what feels like Vargas’ sharp-eyed control over the material. Tightly framed in contrast to many of Sundance’s more freewheeling handheld entries from young directors, it’s a lively portrait of the local Dominican American population and urban diasporic identity that packs punches as sweet and bitter as the “Nutty” beach cocktail drinks Rico peddles to make a living. “Mad Bills to Pay” won a NEXT special jury prize for its ensemble, which the filmmakers assembled after a careful search. —RL ', '', 'No single story out of this year’s Sundance captured my heart and mind as much as the one behind Kate Beecroft’s stunning feature debut, “East of Wall.” An inventive, soulful piece of auto-fiction that has changed the lives of all involved with it, Beecroft’s film is absolutely luminous on its own, but when you consider the incredible serendipity that led her to her subjects and the years-long odyssey to make a film around them, it’s tough not to be in awe of her tenacity and tenderness. We can’t wait to see where “East of Wall” goes, and we can’t wait to see where Beecroft heads next. —KE', 'Actor Joe Apollonio has memorably impressed with small roles on TV series including “Hacks” and “Young Sheldon.” The queer New York comedian, who debuted a one-man stage show at New York’s Public Theater in 2023 — playing not only himself but also his single mother — gets his first major big-screen showcase in Amalia Ulman’s Sundance premiere “Magic Farm.”', '', 'The film follows an inept, mostly American crew to what they hope is Argentina in hopes of profiling a musician for their VICE-esque documentary show, a mix of ethnography and exploitation as they clash (and spark) with the locals. Apollonio — with an ‘80s-esque hairstyle one local tells him looks like a wig, but nope, it’s real — plays Justin, the curious, queer one of the group who forms an unlikely attraction to a South American motel manager. It’s a winsomely (and sometimes wincingly) hilarious performance as the most flamboyant head of the ensemble. His Instagram, in which Apollonio plays on the cultural tropes of the sliding queer spectrum, no doubt prepared him for this charming breakout role and caught the filmmakers’ attention. —RL', 'A little flash goes a long way at Sundance, where young and emerging filmmakers hope to wow the whole American movie industry in one fell swoop and be labeled “the next big thing” on the strength of a single screening. In that context, the poise and modesty of Sierra Falconer’s feature-length debut was always going to make “Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake)” feel like something of an anomaly in the Competition line-up, but it’s Falconer’s confidence — expressed through, but not entirely defined by her complete refusal to capitulate to modern tastes and attention spans — that made it into a standout as well.', '', 'An original anthology consisting of four wistfully effervescent vignettes set on the shores of the northern Michigan lake that lend the film its literary title, “Sunfish” resists the unevenness endemic to its format by drawing a gentle power from the stillness of the water that runs through it. Falconer’s characters (a teenage girl ditched at her grandparents’ lake house, a young music prodigy, a barback in for the shift of her life, and two sisters on the verge of splitting up) don’t overlap in any literal respect, but they’re so bound together by a shared sense of place that it seems like they’re all bound up together, especially when they feel at their most alone. Falconer’s Cheever-esque writing and smartly unfussy direction help bring this world right out of her bones, and while “Sunfish” may not be the kind of movie that lands someone a Marvel gig, we suspect that Falconer’s sharp eye will see her toward a far more exciting future than that. —DE', '“Lurker” writer/director Alex Russell comes to Sundance with established bonafides, having won an Emmy for producing TV’s “Beef” and a WGA Award for his writing on “The Bear.” But his bracing feature debut about the toxic relationships that form the Los Angeles music industry machine announces an exciting visionary behind the camera.', '', 'The buzzy Sundance premiere follows Théodore Pellerin as an introverted hanger-on who becomes a potentially exploited groupie of a Dominic Fike-like rising pop star, played by Archie Madekwe. Russell adeptly balances tones as the movie careens from L.A. celebrity portrait to an eerie character study of a desperate parasocial leech who still deserves our compassion anyway. We’re eager to see where Russell heads next — and if it’s for another Los Angeles story, he’s already nailed painting the town as a place where you’re defined not by who you are but what you do. —RL', 'At the Sunday night premiere of his debut film, the wickedly funny body horror joint “Together,” filmmaker Michael Shanks told an excited Eccles crowd that he was very pleased to have his family in the room, including his mother, who he promised flew a long way from their native Australia to see a film she would hate. That sort of sweetness, humor, and darkness goes a long way toward describing his winning Midnight entry (and, we hope and expect, his filmmaking worldview in general).', '', 'Producers (and real-life married couple) Alison Brie and Dave Franco star in the film as a young couple at loose ends, with high hopes that a move to the country will help solidify their bond. Oh, boy, does it ever. When Millie and Tim go on a hike, fall into a cave, and spend the night next to the grossest body of still water you’ve ever seen, we already know nothing good will come of it, but what the very funny Shanks offers is a twist: Maybe the most disgusting thing you’ve ever dreamed will be good for your relationship? Combining clever relationship drama with icky, sticky body horror, his “Together” was one of the real joys of the festival, and a testament to how much fun scary stuff can be when experienced, well, together. —KE', 'For her debut film “Seeds,” filmmaker Brittany Shyne uses her camera to capture parts of her subjects others might ignore. Shyne, who also serves as cinematographer, focuses on hands, weathered with creases. She looks at hair, washed in a sink. She lovingly lingers on ash dangling off a cigarette and the worn toes of boots. Shyne’s powerful eye is one of the reasons “Seeds,” a lyrical portrait of Black farmers in the American South, was one of the must-see documentaries at Sundance, and will continue to be vital once released for a broader audience. Per our review, the film was clearly personal for Shyne.', '', 'The filmmaker, “who was raised in Ohio, did not grow up on a farm, but her ancestors did: Her paternal great-grandfather owned 300 acres in Louisiana. And while she does not state this in the film, she eventually alludes to her own intimacy with this community. Still, she herself remains on the outskirts of the story. The only glimpse of her we see is an outstretched hand, as if she’s reaching through her medium. And yet her viewpoint becomes like a family member for the Kenativa-Williams clan, a group with whom she embeds herself. … ‘Seeds’ requires patience. Clocking in at over two hours, Shyne takes her time. You have to orient yourself to the slow rhythms of the piece, which encourage you to relish in these quiet moments. But it’s an incredibly rewarding journey, a film indebted to the past that feels brilliantly alive.” —KE', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Sundance 2025: A Complete Wrap-Up and the Best of the Fest!,https://www.joblo.com/sundance-2025-a-complete-wrap-up/,"['HOME » MOVIE NEWS » SUNDANCE 2025: A COMPLETE WRAP-UP AND THE BEST OF THE FEST!', 'We’re back from the Sundance Film Festival with a complete wrap-up and info on when you’ll see the best of the fest!', 'This year’s edition of the Sundance Film Festival felt a touch bittersweet to me. You see, Sundance is on the verge of relocating, with it increasingly unlikely that it will continue in Park City past the 2026 festival edition. Having been going to Sundance since 2010 (where does the time go), I must admit I felt a little sad sitting in some of the classic Sundance spots this year, like the Holiday Village Cinemas (where all the press screenings are) and the classic Eccles theatre, as after next year that might be the end of their run as premium Sundance spots. I’ve seen so many classics in these theatres, and it will be a shame to bid adieu to Park City.', 'Oh well, at least we have the 2026 edition to look forward to. As it is, the 2025 edition turned out to be the best edition of the festival since it was rocked by the pandemic. One issue in recent years is that Sundance movies haven’t been breaking through to the mainstream as much as they used to, but this year I saw several films that have a good chance of working for the masses. Neon bought the horror flick Together and has already given it a summer release date, while the buzzy word-of-mouth hit of the festival, Sorry, Baby, got bought by A24. While there were a few disappointments (the much anticipated A24 horror flick, Opus, landed with a thud), there were a lot of great movies showing at the fest. Here are some of our favourites:', 'This thriller, The Bear’s Alex Russell’s feature directorial debut, focuses on a retail employee (Theodore Pellerin) who insinuates himself into the inner orbit of a rising pop star (Archie Madekwe). The reviews for this have been excellent, and it has so much appeal that it seems bound to walk away from the festival with a solid distribution deal. I’m actually surprised one hasn’t been announced yet, as it feels like a no-brainer for either A24 or a top-streamer like Prime Video or Netflix.', 'This quiet, contemplative semi-western gives Joel Edgerton the jaw-dropping showcase he’s always deserved. Netflix ponied up a huge $16 million for the rights to this one, and it seems likely they’ll push it hard in next year’s awards season. Edgerton may well enter into the Oscar conversation next year, and this is an excellent film that I’m eager to see again. ', 'Neon has already set an August 1st wide release for this body horror flick, which features standout turns from real-life spouses Alison Brie and Dave Franco. This film is a total blast, with frenetic pacing, gross practical effects, and an arresting visual style from writer-director Michael Shanks. This might be Neon’s next big genre hit.', 'Another awesome body horror flick, this is a defiantly R-rated take on Cinderella, told from the perspective of one of the “ugly” stepsisters. Due for a Shudder release, given how jaw-droppingly insane it is, this might prove to be their most talked-about movie since Late Night With the Devil, with it earning a place alongside classic fairy tale deconstructions like The Company of Wolves. Shudder/ IFC should put this out as counter-programming to Disney’s Snow White reboot.', 'This two-part documentary will be airing on HBO and streaming on MAX within a few months, and it offers the great Paul Reubens a posthumous opportunity to tell his own life story. It’s definitely the saddest film I saw at the festival, as a deathbed interview Reubens conducted (which is in the film) reveals certain rumors haunted him until the day he died. Hopefully, this documentary gives him the vindication he never received in life.', 'Read all of our Sundance reviews HERE. Which one are you most excited to see?', 'Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

Memo to Distributors: Buy These Sundance 2025 Movies,https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/best-undistributed-movies-sundance-2025/,"['', 'It was just a few years ago that Sundance was still famous for its feeding frenzy-like atmosphere as a sales market, with movies like “The Farewell” and “Blindspotting” triggering the sort of all-night bidding wars that have become as much a part of festival legend as the films themselves. While “A Real Pain” commanded similar attention last year, and titles like “Together” (Neon) and “Sorry, Baby” (A24) leveraged buzzy premieres into healthy price tags over just the last few days, the overwhelming majority of the best titles from Sundance 2025 are still looking for a proper home.', 'We suspect that will change at some point in the immediate future — distributors might not go to Park City with the same “buy now!” mentality they once had, but they still need product. And the product is compelling: From starry indies like “Rebuilding” (Josh O’Connor as a sad cowboy!) to movies of the moment like “Lurker,” and from urgently political docs like “The Perfect Neighbor” to classic Sundance breakouts like “East of Wall,” there’s plenty of stuff for the taking. We even have a TV show on our list this year, the perfect fodder for any streamer hoping to get more than they bargained for out of this year’s Sundance lineup.', 'If you’re looking for more of our Sundance coverage, you can find it all right here. Want to check out our video interviews from our studio? They live here. And, if you’re really wanting to bone up on your Sundance 2025 knowledge, head on over to our list of the festival’s biggest breakout talents.', 'Alison Foreman, Harrison Richlin, Ryan Lattanzio, and Esther Zuckerman also contributed to this article.', 'A genderqueer poet and their partner battle advanced ovarian cancer in director Ryan White’s “Come See Me in the Good Light” — a life-affirming documentary that came to Sundance at a critical time for LGBTQ people in American media. This intimate portrait of Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley (also a writer and poet) brings audiences into a soulful romance between two artists grappling with life’s most harrowing questions. The love seen here suggests how you live your life and care for the people in it can be its own kind of art form.', 'As complex conversations about impermanence spill into increasingly difficult medical appointments, Gibson and Falley engage with each other and White’s lens to challenge how we see identity in the face of an all-consuming and transformative illness. The well-spoken and likable subjects foster a generous tone that could earnestly inspire compassion from some less tolerant viewers, and the project overall helps boost their voices and platform in this difficult cultural moment. It’s easy to imagine the film performing well for any streamer, though we suspect that a boutique label would be rewarded for giving the movie the theatrical push it deserves. —AF', 'From Vittorio di Sica’s “Bicycle Thieves” to the films of the Safdies and Sean Baker, using non-professional actors has long been a tool filmmakers have employed to add a note of authenticity to their work. And yet, with “East of Wall,” writer/director Kate Beecroft elevates this concept to greater heights, crafting a feature docu-fiction debut that is cinematically and narratively rich, but also takes care to reflect the deeper reality at the heart of its story. Backstopped by familiar faces like Scoot McNairy and Jennifer Ehle, the film stars horse rancher Tabatha Zimiga as a version of herself, and takes place on her singular horse ranch in the Badlands, where she also raises a motley crew of teenagers who have nowhere else to go (in addition to an infant of her own). You’d be hard-pressed to find a stronger woman, but the weight of caring for so many others as she struggles to care for herself still threatens to crush Tabatha into the earth.', 'In working with non-professional actors, filmmakers like the Safdies and Baker often want to exist within the chaos of these individuals, but Beecroft and DP Austin Shelton’s lens is far more nuanced. It offers grace and sensitivity. It captures beauty and turmoil, sometimes in the same frame. They want you to understand the environs of these characters as much as you understand their souls; fractured and beaten, yet still making space for whoever needs it. “East of Wall” is a vintage Sundance movie — the kind that once commanded a limited summer release before platforming its way to a couple million dollars. With its unique hook and richly cinematic approach, a smart distributor could make that happen again. —HR', 'It’s hard enough to watch a full season of television at Sundance, let alone to sell one, but Cooper Raiff — whose “Cha Cha Real Smooth” was one of the festival’s biggest sales of the pandemic era — had good reason to believe that his deeply affecting grief dramedy would resonate with festival audiences who made the time to see it. Characteristically earnest and charming even as it digs at much rawer wounds than any of Raiff’s previous works, “Hal & Harper” proved to be a major highlight at a Sundance defined by its stagnancy, as its decades-spanning story about a pair of hyper-codependent siblings — stunted as children by their mother’s sudden death — offered a poignant reminder that some things only feel like you’ll never be able to outgrow them. It’s a sensation that Raiff’s show literalizes to great effect, as he and his co-lead Lili Reinhart (extraordinary) don’t just play the title characters as the rudderless adults they are in the present, but also as the emotionally paralyzed elementary schoolers they were in the past. That conceit might sound cloying on paper, but, like so much of this beautiful show, the actual effect resolves into a raw and heartbreaking illustration of what loss can do to a kid, and to the grown-up they’ll eventually become. ', 'Scripted, independent television is still a novel concept, and I can’t pretend to be an expert on how it works. But it’s almost impossible to imagine that streamers would be unwilling to invest in a singular and hyper-bingeable show of this quality, let alone one that also boasts excellent supporting turns from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Betty Gilpin, Addison Timlin, and Havana Rose Liu. Fingers crossed that people everywhere will soon get to savor what Sundance’s virtual audiences were able to speed through last weekend. —DE', 'In an age in which information is weaponized and fact debatable to the point of meaninglessness, media has served as both an indispensable tool and a rallying cry for whichever side you choose to support, a fact that allows journalism to become more about pushing a specific message than actually seeking out the truth. This conflict is at the crux of Sam Feder‘s legal documentary “Heightened Scrutiny,” which captures ACLU attorney and transgender rights activist Chase Strangio as he prepares to argue in front of the Supreme Court in the case of United States v. Skrmetti.', 'The Skrmetti case originated as a challenge to a Tennessee law prohibiting transgender minors from accessing certain forms of gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but Strangio makes clear throughout the film: If this law is upheld by the Supreme Court, it will lead to a full-out attack on trans identity in America. Not just for children, but adults too who would have to face a legal system that effectively would be giving states the right to take away gender-affirming care based on information that is largely not grounded in fact. Where does this information come from? As “Heightened Scrutiny” takes care to lay out, a great deal of anti-trans bias is circulated through mainstream media, and not just from right-wing sources like Fox News, but in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, and many more supposedly liberal publications.', 'Needless to say, Feder’s documentary is as urgent and timely as it gets. It would be great to see this one get out there as soon and as widely as possible — perhaps a major streamer like Disney or Hulu is willing to heed the call. —HR', '“Beef” executive producer Alex Russell makes his feature filmmaking debut with “Lurker,” “an unsettling thriller starring the great rising actor Théodore Pellerin as a young man obsessed with an L.A. pop star, played by talented “Saltburn” breakout Archie Madekwe. Matthew’s (Pellerin) attachment to Oliver (Madekwe) at first seems innocent, even if he’s being exploited by Oliver’s groupies as a photographer who could potentially direct the musician’s videos or a documentary about his career. But the obsession turns dangerous and potentially career-killing in this spare, sharp first film shot on location in Los Angeles and evocative of all the city’s dreamers and hangers-on, in a place where you are defined not by who you are but by what you do. And who, however ruinously, you want to become.', '“Lurker” is among the most broadly commercial movies that premiered at Sundance this year, and feels extremely of the moment without overplaying its hand. Any streamer would be lucky to snap it up, but that would be a shame for an indie that boasts a star-making role or two, and seems all but guaranteed to become a word-of-mouth mini-hit at the summer box office. Rough comps like “Emily the Criminal” and “Ingrid Goes West” suggest that an early August release might reward a smaller indie label for having the good sense to invest. —RL ', '“Eraserhead” meets “The Legend of Zelda” in director Albert Birney’s scrappy sci-fi “OBEX,” which the “Strawberry Mansion” filmmaker co-wrote with Pete Ohs. A kite shaped like a horse, a cicada-filled Baltimore world, and a black-and-white aesthetic almost perversely hooked on its own disaffected weirdness define this movie about a computer programmer (also played by Birney) who retreats from dreary Baltimore into a fantasy video game world. Just as Conor (Birney) is hooked to making dot matrix printer art off his vintage Mac, so “OBEX” too is tapped into the nostalgia we all have for an analog world — the warm yearn for simpler times. The world of “OBEX,” named for the fictional video game world Conor gets sucked into after a newspaper advertisement promises the ultimate escapist experience, is eerily captivating thanks to cinematographer Ohs’ portent-steeped atmosphere. This one feels destined for midnight movie status, making it a plum choice for a genre film boutique that knows how to connect “OBEX” with the right cult-leaning audience. —RL', 'Shot almost entirely by police body cams and interrogation room CCTVs, Geeta Gandbhir’s unforgettable documentary crystallizes the horrors of stand-your-ground laws by examining their effects through the lens of a single case — one that harrowingly illustrates the defects of castle doctrines (among other policy failures) by painting a microcosmic portrait of white America’s inability to parse between fear and anger. ', 'Stand-your-ground laws aren’t even mentioned by name until “The Perfect Neighbor” is more than half over, as Gandbhir elects to work the issue from the inside out, with the you-are-there reality of the footage she uses bringing viewers right into the heart of what’s ultimately a human matter. Indeed, a subjective camera has seldom been more damning than it is here — here, in an American horror story that doesn’t hinge on whether or not white Florida woman Susan Lorincz was actually in danger when she fired on the unarmed neighbor knocking at her front door, but rather on whether or not Susan Lorincz believed she was in danger when the young Black mother from across the street, Ajike Owens, came to retrieve her son’s confiscated tablet. ', 'Sure to be one of the year’s most viscerally compelling films on the strength of its montage alone, “The Perfect Neighbor” is a political lightning rod in the making, as well as a rallying cry for a country where people feel all too powerless to stop any of the tragedies we’re made to witness. This has the potential to be one of the most impactful documentaries in years, and any distributor would be privileged to help shepherd it into the public eye. —DE', 'A raw and riveting documentary that skeptically re-examines the appeal, legacy, and ethicality of “To Catch a Predator,” David Osit’s “Predators” certainly doesn’t make the case that the child predators featured on the show were undeserving of scorn (and in profound need of help). And yet, as both a filmmaker whose work (“Mayor,” “Thank You for Playing”) has always been compelled by moral inquiry, as well as a person for whom “To Catch a Predator” triggered a swirl of conflicting emotions, Osit is haunted by his enjoyment of a show that was ultimately less interested in crime than punishment. Hansen’s theatrics helped paved the way for a media landscape driven by humiliation rituals, and “Predators” leverages the success of that NBC program — along with the tragedy of how it ended, and the YouTube vigilantes who’ve iterated on its format with even less oversight than Hansen ever had — into a probing investigation of its own. ', 'The film’s ultimate conclusion is clear from the start: “To Catch a Predator” was an invitation to see the world in black-and-white, a prospect which has only become more enticing in light of America’s subsequent chaos. It was an invitation to tar and feather people so plainly “evil” that everyone watching along at home couldn’t help but to feel “good” by comparison. And though it sold itself as an invitation to make sense of an inexplicable wrong, the show’s power was rooted in the permission it gave us to ignore why such heinous violations continue to happen.', 'As “Predators” makes clear, there are very real consequences to presenting dehumanization as a righteous act of public justice. “To Catch a Predator” might seem like the wrong lens through which to make that case, as few people invite less sympathy than the men who found their way into Hansen’s web. But that is exactly what makes Osit’s film such a powerful indictment of the lens through which we’ve since been conditioned to see everything else as well. There’s always some risk in distributing a documentary that threatens to enflame right-wing media, re-activate the remnants of the anti-“Cuties” brigade (remember that?), and/or even just force audiences to question their own mindsets, but “Predators” is plenty strong enough to speak for itself, and it deserves a chance to do so with the benefit of the biggest platform it can find. —DE', 'Loath as I am to label anything as “the movie people need right now,” it’s hard to think of Max Walker-Silverman’s “Rebuilding” in any other terms at the moment. A spare but deeply felt sketch of a drama about a divorced Colorado rancher (a hangdog Josh O’Connor) trying to make sense of what he’s got left in the wake of a devastating wildfire, the story is every bit as gentle as the rest of Walker-Silverman’s work (i.e. 2022’s “A Love Song”), and yet still honest enough to reckon with the heartache of losing one’s home. In fact, it’s only because “Rebuilding” is so raw in its pain that it’s able to resolve into such an effectively comforting balm; the film begins with generations of memory smoldering into 1,000 acres of scorched earth, and from the ashes rescues a new foundation on which its characters might credibly be able to create the next iteration of their lives. ', 'How do you build something that lasts in a world where climate change can, has, and will continue to wipe centuries of history right off the map? When the threat of another tragic wildfire is not a matter of “if,” but “when?” “It’s funny,” someone says, “the things you pack and the things you leave.” This quietly affecting little movie finds real poignancy in paying attention to what those things are, and — ultimately — in forging them together so that someone else might have the gift of mourning these ruins one day.', '“Rebuilding” is a small and delicate film that might default to a streamer for those reasons, but it rewards the undivided attention of the big screen experience, and O’Connor’s presence should be enough to tempt a theatrical distributor; it would certainly be a great opportunity for one of the older-skewing labels to work with one of today’s brightest younger stars. —DE', 'In Brittany Shyne’s gorgeous documentary “Seeds” the camera often captures parts of her subjects others might ignore. ', 'Shyne, who also serves as cinematographer, focuses on hands, weathered with creases. She looks at hair, washed in a sink. She lovingly lingers on ash dangling off a cigarette and the worn toes of boots. Shyne’s powerful eye is one of the reasons “Seeds,” a lyrical portrait of Black farmers in the American South, is one of the must-see documentaries at Sundance, and will continue to be vital once released for a broader audience. ', 'Captured in exquisite black and white, Shyne creates a moving testament to a dwindling population. The world of these landowners is threatened by discrimination and government ignorance. But “Seeds” is not all that concerned with statistics, though they are shared in passing. Shyne makes a forceful argument through just letting the audience be absorbed with a way of life. “Seeds” requires patience; you have to orient yourself to the slow rhythms of the piece, which encourage you to relish in these quiet moments. But it’s an incredibly rewarding journey, a film indebted to the past that feels brilliantly alive. It’s also a film that demands being seen on the big screen, and one that would benefit from the bespoke attention that a small theatrical distributor could provide it. An Oscar nomination would seem very possible if nurtured correctly, and so we hope that’s incentive enough for this special movie to end up in the right hands. —EZ', 'A little flash goes a long way at Sundance, where young and emerging filmmakers hope to wow the whole American movie industry in one fell swoop and be labeled “the next big thing” on the strength of a single screening. In that context, the poise and modesty of Sierra Falconer’s feature-length debut was always going to make “Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake)” feel like something of an anomaly in the Competition line-up, but it’s Falconer’s confidence — expressed through, but not entirely defined by her complete refusal to capitulate to modern tastes and attention spans — that made it into a standout as well.', 'An original anthology consisting of four wistfully effervescent vignettes set on the shores of the northern Michigan lake that lend the film its literary title, “Sunfish” resists the unevenness endemic to its format by drawing a gentle power from the stillness of the water that runs through it. Falconer’s characters (a teenage girl ditched at her grandparents’ lake house, a young music prodigy, a barback in for the shift of her life, and two sisters on the verge of splitting up) don’t overlap in any literal respect, but they’re so bound together by a shared sense of place that it seems like they’re all bound up together, especially when they feel at their most alone. Falconer’s Cheever-esque writing and smartly unfussy direction help bring this world right out of her bones, and I suspect that the film’s calmingly evocative sense of place might be enough to make it a word-of-mouth hit for any distributor patient enough to platform it over the summer (last year’s “Good One” feels like a decent comp, though Andrew Ahn’s lovely “Driveways” would have made an even better one if not for being shuffled to VOD because of the pandemic). —DE', 'The existential apocalypse of a Turkish literature professor gets an oblique and chilling study in “The Things You Kill.” On its surface, this disquieting diptych about male anxiety has the feel of, say, an Asghar Farhadi movie, a moral dilemma urging forth a thriller plot. But that’s precisely the sort of bait-and-switch Iranian writer/director Alireza Khatami is operating on here, until his tense and nightmarish film starts to resemble more something like David Lynch’s “Lost Highway” as directed by Abbas Kiarostami. Khatami (“Terrestrial Verses”), who lives in Canada, relocated the setting from Iran to Turkey to evade censorship in his native country — a censorship of patriarchal violence that the film itself also rings upon like a warning bell of a bleak future. “The Things You Kill” is like a bad, sweat-breaking dream that leaves you dazed and feverish — and a black-hearted gaze into the poison patriarchy oozing into men’s veins just as much as women. ', 'Khatami’s film may not have the instant hook capable of luring Neon and its ilk, but it would be a shame to see this movie slip through the cracks only to wind up on a random streaming service in a year or two. If framed correctly, its Lynchian energy and genre appeal should be enough to reward any of the smaller theatrical labels the film might able to lure. —RL', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

10 BEST MOVIES AT SUNDANCE 2025,https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/best-movies-sundance-2025-1235240663/,"['By DAVID FEAR', 'We came, we saw (close to 40 films in all), we laughed, we cried — for yet another year, and likely the second-to-last time in Park City, we Sundanced. The 41st edition of the Sundance Film Festival, which kicked off on January 23rd and concludes today, felt like business as usual in so many ways: Main Street was still crowded, even with it being closed off to cars during the opening weekend; the movies were still a mixed bag, with the best inspiring epiphanies and the worst offering a choice between earnestness, urgency, or self-conscious quirkiness; people still excitedly shared their opinions on what they’d seen while eating in restaurants, sipping coffee on the shuttle buses, waiting in line for the next screening, and the next, and the next.', 'But there was a bit of an edge to the usual celebratory mood this time around. Visiting Angelenos were still dazed by the recent fires. Longtime festgoers wondered where the event would take place when it moves out of the ski-resort town after one last go-round in 2026. Everyone basked in the empathy so prevalent onscreen, then exited theaters and checked their phones to take in the firehouse spray of bad news coming out of Washington D.C., all of which seemed so bereft of humanity.', 'All 10 of the films that were the highlights of our festival this year, however, proved that Sundance is still a place where you can find new, exciting, and bold work that sometimes offers an alternative to our current mondo-fucked moment, sometimes reflects back how we got here, and always reminds us why the annual pilgrimage with fellow movie-obsessed freaks is worth the trip. From a modest trip back from NYC ’74 to an epic look at early 20th century America, solid works from returning filmmakers to a handful of mindblowing debuts, these were the films that made this year’s Sundance shine.', '(Honorable mentions to: It’s Never Over Jeff Buckley, Move Ya Body: The Birth of House, Pee-wee as Himself, The Perfect Neighbor, Rabbit Trap, Rebuilding, Sunfish (and Others Stories at Green Lake), Together, The Things You Kill, Twinless.)', 'Kahlil Joseph’s feature-length expansion of his BLKNWS video art installation came perilously close to not getting a Sundance premiere — it was actually temporarily pulled from the festival, due to some behind-the-scenes controversy involving a new cut that had not been shown to its producers. Thankfully, he managed to get it back on the lineup, and we’re all the better for it. A kaleidoscope of images filtered through autobiography, Afro-futurism fiction, archival footage and the format of a free-form news show, Joseph’s quick tour through African-American culture over the last few centuries felt radical and mindblowing in the best possible way. It’s ability to rewire your ideas on everything from W.E.B Dubois’ lifelong dream of compiling a Black encyclopedia to how the art world engages (or doesn’t) with Black artists as you’re watching the film felt sui generis even for the fest’s anything-goes NEXT section; Joseph compared it to an album with “tracks,” rather than scenes,” and the comparison feels apt. Our only regret is that we only saw it once — this is the sort of work that demands repeat viewings.', 'A veteran of TV writers’ rooms on everything from Beef to The Bear, Alex Russell’s filmmaking debut somehow managed to take a well-worn subject — the disparity of power between the famous and the famous-adjacent — and make it feel fresh, dangerous and so cringe-comedic that you wanted to cover your eyes. An employee (Théodore Pellerin) at a boutique clothing store manages to work his way into the entourage of a British pop singer (Saltburn‘s Archie Madekwe) who’s one hit album away from leveling up to superstardom. Once he’s in the inner circle, however, he has to fight to stay there, and most movies would have ended with the inevitable exile from Eden. But Russell keeps going, pushing an already volatile Have vs. Have-nots scenario into the red, and you’re left with a lesson on Sociopathic Ambition 101 that sharpens rather than dulls its edges. Call it Nightcrawler for the social media generation.', 'Sundance veteran Ira Sachs (Keep the Lights On, Passages) gifted the fest with a low-key gabfest masterpiece, focusing his attention on a single extended, IRL interview between writer Linda Rosenkrantz (Rebecca Hall) and her friend, photographer Peter Hujar (Ben Whishaw) in downtown NYC ’74. That’s it, but dear god, it’s more than enough to evoke a lost world of downtown scenesters, art-world gossip, funky fashion choices, post-Stonewall gay culture and Beat legends behaving badly. (The Allen Ginsberg anecdote alone is worth the price of admission.) A conversation between two chatty Lower East Side hipster luminaries — resurrected by two preternaturally gifted actors at the top of their game — doesn’t need much more than the camera to be in focus, to be honest. Yet the way in which Sachs turns their conversation into something like a time machine easily made this a standout among this year’s brand-name narrative entries.', 'The idea of documentary diving deep into the legacy of To Catch a Predator, the infamous and popular Dateline NBC that Jimmy Kimmel dubbed “Punk’d for pedophiles,” was intriguing enough on the surface to generate a lot of buzz before the festival even started. Filmmaker David Osit delivers that, to be sure, but he also takes a cold, hard look at how the show has popularized vigilante justice and repurposed it as reality TV entertainment, spawned copycats who maybe — maybe — have sacrificed ethics for clicks and lolz, and stripped any sense of empathy from the equation. It climaxes with Osit sitting down with Chris Hansen himself and staging a rhetorical interrogation to a draw. Someone needs to pick up this doc ASAP.', 'Shot in gorgeous black-and-white and unfolding like a post-church, pre-supper Sunday afternoon, Brittany Shyne’s debut chronicles the everyday lives of modern Black farmers, working the land and trying to sustain their agrarian livelihood in the 21st century. The mood is neither morose nor blindly optimistic, even as the film celebrates the sense of family and community among these Southerners (and calls out the Biden administration re: the lopsided racial politics involving timely subsidy payments). Instead, Shyne observes the men at work and at home, giving them a chance to tell their stories, air anxieties about generational inheritance or simply let the long, silent shots of them going about their business speak for the way they’ve endured. It’s a work of political activism through sheer lyricism, and exactly the kind of discovery you come to Sundance to see.', 'Questlove’s portrait of Sly Stone — band leader, world-class frontman, Age of Aquarius martyr and, ultimately, triumphant survivor — is a perfect primer those who either know him as just tabloid-headline fodder or the “Everyday People” guy. You get a great sense of the who, what, where, and when of Sly & the Family Stone’s singular mash-up of rock, soul, funk and virtually everything but the kitchen sink. Most importantly, the filmmaker underlines the why behind their meteoric rise up the charts and Sly’s ascension to iconic status, which also sets the stage for Questlove to ask other music legends (Nile Rodgers, George Clinton, Q-Tip, D’Angelo and more) about the blessings and burdens of “Black genius.” It’s a great compliment to Summer of Soul, as well as a way of reframing Sly’s winter of discontent throughout the late 1970s and beyond.', 'Congratulations, Eva Victor, on being the breakout MVP of Sundance 2025. The writer-director-star of this semi-fractured, sometimes harrowing and often hilarious tale of a teacher dealing with a longstanding trauma not only managed to channel a comic voice honed through improv shows and viral tweets. It more or less immediately established Victor as a multi-hyphenate to be reckoned with and, taking the festival by storm right at the midway point, divided this year’s edition into Before Sorry, Baby and After Sorry, Baby eras. The temptation is to compare Victor to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, especially since the movie gives off heavy Fleabag vibes (minus the fourth-wall breaking). But while they may be kindred spirits, this Brooklyn-by-way-of-San-Francisco artist is mining a dry wit and understated pathos that’s all her own. Throw in solid supporting performances from Naomi Ackie, Lucas Hedges and Louis Cancelmi, and you have a keeper here. Wisely, the fest jury gave the film the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. It deserved to sweep the competition.', 'The other film that was as close to a consensus pick for Best-of-Fest from the cognoscenti besides Sorry, Baby, Clint Bentley’s adaptation of the Denis Johnson novella about the life and times of a logger named Robert Granier (Joel Edgerton) practicing his trade in the early part of the 20th century weaves a spell over you from the first frame and never breaks its hold. It’s a meditative film that reminds you of early Terrence Malick, with its languorous shots of nature and philosophical narration as Granier witnesses the best and worst of this nation’s growing pains, falls in love with resourceful woman named Gladys (Felicity Jones), and experiences both peace of mind and great tragedy. (Bonus: You also get William H. Macy going full Walter Brennan as a crazy old coot!) But the movie truly hinges on Edgerton, who gives the best performance of his career playing the kind of stoic, callous-handed man who helped build modern America from the ground up. Netflix picked this up out of the fest, and we pray on bent knees that they don’t just bury this in the algorithm. It’s an absolutely stunning work, and the kind of big-swing independent movie that demands big screens and bigger audiences.', 'Ukrainian director Mstyslav Chernov follows-up his Oscar-winning 20 Days in Mariupol with this relentless piece of war reportage, following a platoon as they attempt to recapture a village occupied by Russian troops. First, however, they have to cross a virtual no-man’s-land: 2000 meters of forestry dotted with landmines, enemy troops and fellow soldiers who failed to get a foothold. The consistent use of first-person perspectives during combat made this one of the more visceral docs at the fest, yet Chernov’s movie isn’t trying to coast on second-hand adrenaline rushes of experiencing firefights from the safety of theater seats. You also hear soldiers discussing their need to fight tooth and nail for every square foot of acreage, as well as their fears that this war for their freedom is an endless one. Occasionally, Chernov informs us via voiceover about the future of the brave soldiers we’re watching, and the fact that it’s rarely good news makes every small victory feel bittersweet. An extraordinary compliment to his earlier, big-picture look at his country under siege, and a moving dispatch from the frontlines.', 'Once upon a time, British multimedia artist and documentarian secured the rights to adapt Lyndon E. Lafferty’s book The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up — in which the retired California Highway Patrol officer claimed that he knew the real identity of the serial killer who plagued the Bay Area in the 1970s — into a docuseries. Then, for reasons that remain murky, the author’s estate pulled out of the deal. So rather than presenting a deep dive into one man’s quest to solve that case, Shackleton describes what he would have done if had he gone through with the project. And quicker than you can say “give me the next Making a Murderer,” this meta-documentary skewers the clichés so beloved by the modern True-Crime Entertainment Complex while showing you exactly how this brand of nonfiction sausage gets made. It’s a full-frontal assault on a way-too-popular genre, done with a trickster’s deft touch. Trust us when we tell you that you will never binge-watch these types of grotesque, guilty pleasures the same way again.', 'We want to hear it.

The 17 Best Movies of Sundance 2025 (And How to See Them),https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/best-movies-sundance-2025-where-to-watch/,"['', 'Sundance 2025 may have been an ill-timed off year for an institution in the midst of an existential crisis (largely by dint of its place in an industry in the midst of an existential crisis), but the festival remains completely unrivaled as America’s greatest showcase for the best in new independent cinema, and its latest edition did nothing to change that. Underwhelming as it was on the whole, the 88-feature lineup still had more than its fair share of fantastic and revitalizing films, many of which we’re sure to be talking about for the rest of the year and beyond.', 'Some (like James Sweeney’s “Twinless” and Clint Bentley’s “Train Dreams”) found semi-established directors emerging as singular talents. Others (like Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby” and Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”) saw relative unknowns or long-absent favorites step into the spotlight as though it had always been waiting for them. Predictably, however, it was the documentaries that drove most of the conversation, as powerhouses like David Osit’s “Predators” and Brittany Shyne’s “Seeds” reminded us that Sundance has become most essential as a launching pad for non-fiction, and you can expect to see many of the docs on this list in the awards conversation later on this year.', 'And those docs are what ultimately reaffirm that Sundance 2025 was too deep to distill to just a few standouts.

And, if you’re really wanting to bone up on your Sundance 2024 knowledge, head on over to our list of the festival’s biggest breakout talents. For now, here’s a list of some films that we can’t stop thinking about.', 'Kate Erbland, Ryan Lattanzio, Alison Foreman, Harrison Richlin, Beandrea July, and Esther Zuckerman also contributed to this article. ', 'The premiere of the genre-blurring feature “BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions” at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival is a drama in and of itself: just days before it was scheduled to screen, the rights-holder to the film pulled it from the festival. Then, a few days into the festival, a surprise sale of the rights to a new owner cleared the way for the film to screen after all. That this struggle over … well … terms and conditions, played out around the unveiling of the film is almost satirical, as it reinforces a need for the kind of rebirth the world of “BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions” insists upon. ', 'The visual sequences in the film unfold like tracks on a mixtape, transitioning from one to the next with varying degrees of seamlessness. There are 21 “tracks” in total on the 2025 version of the “BLKNWS” mixtape. They include stream of consciousness sequences focused on Black diasporic culture sourced from YouTube clips, social media posts, memes, archival footage, Black encyclopedia entries, and vignettes of family memoir from Joseph. A fictional, afro-futurist tale of a transatlantic ocean liner called The Nautica makes up several tracks, as well as a historical docudrama about the life and work of the scholar W.E.B. DuBois. To reference the influential cultural historian Saidiya Hartman, one of the writers and foundational appearances in the film, this is an act of “critical fabulation” to normalize and imagine the so-called “wayward lives” of figures whose voices are often missing from historical archives.', '“BLKNWS: Terms & Condition” unfolds at a pace that’s mostly relentless, with only periodic spaces to breathe in between its onslaughts (like extended pauses on the Nautica and the vast ocean), but I was surprise that I didn’t feel overwhelmed as I watched. Instead I felt myself uncross my arms, lean back and surrender to this cinematic experience. No matter what your relationship to Black culture — or to experimental film — that’s probably the posture most amenable to consuming “BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions.” Cinema needs more filmmakers like Joseph and his collaborators, artists making truly original work that emerges from a self-aware yet playful artistic vision. —BJ', 'How you can see it: Still seeking U.S. distribution, but set to screen next at the Berlinale later this month.', 'A genderqueer poet and their partner battle advanced ovarian cancer in director Ryan White’s “Come See Me in the Good Light” — a life-affirming documentary that came to Sundance at a critical time for LGBTQ people in American media. This intimate portrait of Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley (also a writer and poet) brings audiences into a soulful romance between two artists grappling with life’s most harrowing questions. The love seen here suggests how you live your life and care for the people in it can be its own kind of art form.', 'As complex conversations about impermanence spill into increasingly difficult medical appointments, Gibson and Falley engage with each other and White’s lens to challenge how we see identity in the face of an all-consuming and transformative illness. The well-spoken and likable subjects foster a generous tone that could earnestly inspire compassion from some less tolerant viewers, and the project overall helps boost their voices and platform in this difficult cultural moment. —AF', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'From Vittorio di Sica’s “Bicycle Thieves” to the films of the Safdies and Sean Baker, using non-professional actors has long been a tool filmmakers have employed to add a note of authenticity to their work. And yet, with “East of Wall,” writer/director Kate Beecroft elevates this concept to greater heights, crafting a feature docu-fiction debut that is cinematically and narratively rich, but also takes care to reflect the deeper reality at the heart of its story. Backstopped by familiar faces like Scoot McNairy and Jennifer Ehle, the film stars horse rancher Tabatha Zimiga as a version of herself, and takes place on her singular horse ranch in the Badlands, where she also raises a motley crew of teenagers who have nowhere else to go (in addition to an infant of her own). You’d be hard-pressed to find a stronger woman, but the weight of caring for so many others as she struggles to care for herself still threatens to crush Tabatha into the earth.', 'In working with non-professional actors, filmmakers like the Safdies and Baker often want to exist within the chaos of these individuals, but Beecroft and DP Austin Shelton’s lens is far more nuanced. It offers grace and sensitivity. It captures beauty and turmoil, sometimes in the same frame. They want you to understand the environs of these characters as much as you understand their souls; Fractured and beaten, yet still making space for whoever needs it. Though “East of Wall” may seem reminiscent of Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider” and “Nomadland” or ’70s character pieces like Bob Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces” or Martin Scorsese’s “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” what Beecroft achieves exists in its own unique realm. It reminds us that no matter who you are, how isolated your world may seem, or how unworthy of being seen you may feel, your life is still deserving of the cinematic treatment. —HR', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'Consider the world made up of two kinds of people: those who see Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s delightful and emotive “Folktales” and think, “Yes, I too would like to spend a year at a Norwegian folk high school,” and those who can’t fathom spending 10 months near the Arctic Circle learning how to hunt, knit, hike, camp, dogsled, and so very much more. However, everyone is vulnerable to being swept up by this dreamy, sensitive story of the plucky teens who do just that.', 'When kids arrive at Pasvik Folk High School, they are warned this isn’t like any other gap year; this experience intends to build teenagers into nothing less than a “new version of self.” Ewing and Grady track a trio of students over a year at Pasvik, all of who arrive in “Finnmark, the northernmost and most exciting county of Norway … almost right on the border to Russia” (an incredible description of the area, care of Pasvik’s own website) with different worries and goals.', 'That subjects Hege, Bjørn Tore, and Romain will learn some big life lessons from Pasvik in general and those pups in particular is expected, but it’s not a given. Instead, we are treated to all the joys and pains of 10 transformative months, with Ewing and Grady taking us inside an experience that’s both specific and oddly universal. —KE', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'In an age in which information is weaponized and fact debatable to the point of meaninglessness, media has served as both an indispensable tool and a rallying cry for whichever side you choose to support, a fact that allows journalism to become more about pushing a specific message than actually seeking out the truth. This conflict is at the crux of Sam Feder‘s legal documentary “Heightened Scrutiny,” which captures ACLU attorney and transgender rights activist Chase Strangio as he prepares to argue in front of the Supreme Court in the case of United States v. Skrmetti.', 'The Skrmetti case originated as a challenge to a Tennessee law prohibiting transgender minors from accessing certain forms of gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but Strangio makes clear throughout the film: If this law is upheld by the Supreme Court, it will lead to a full-out attack on trans identity in America. Not just for children, but adults too who would have to face a legal system that effectively would be giving states the right to take away gender-affirming care based on information that is largely not grounded in fact. Where does this information come from? As “Heightened Scrutiny” takes care to lay out, a great deal of anti-trans bias is circulated through mainstream media, and not just from right-wing sources like Fox News, but in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, and many more supposedly liberal publications.', 'In Feder’s 2020 documentary “Disclosure” — a film that should be required viewing for all those working in entertainment — the filmmaker tracks the evolution of how trans life is represented on screen, from harmful portrayals in movies like “The Crying Game” to more rounded depictions in the FX series “Pose.”  With “Heightened Scrutiny,” Feder forms another compelling argument against trans bias, albeit one that’s immediacy proves far more dire. —HR', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'A Montauk psychotherapist whose unseen daughter is struggling with a mysterious illness, Lind — played by a magnificently unraveling Rose Byrne — has lost whatever was left of her ability to distinguish between a minor inconvenience and an apocalyptic crisis. In that light, it’s only natural that one of the rawest and most honest movies ever made about contemporary motherhood should be surreal enough to conflate perception and reality in much the same way; that Mary Bronstein’s harried (but frequently hilarious) portrait of a well-heeled white lady trying to survive a temporary inconvenience should cleave a lot closer to the likes of “Uncut Gems” and “Eraserhead” than it does to, say, “Gilmore Girls.”', 'More realistic by virtue of its pronounced expressionism, “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” is the kind of film in which the things that should be scary are funny, and the things that should be funny are terrifying. The premise itself is every parent’s worst nightmare, but it’s shaped in a way that makes it feel like a cosmic joke. Bronstein’s film doesn’t paint in broad strokes or retreat into the self-satisfaction of forced empowerment, but it spirals towards the very bottom of Linda’s soul with a terminal velocity that feels as incontrovertible and uncompromising as the laws of physics. They always say to put your own oxygen mask on first, but what if you are the emergency? And how is anyone supposed to pull themselves out of such a severe tailspin? If the answers prove elusive, the process of searching for them is harrowing in a way that’s impossible to shake. —DE ', 'How to see it: A24 will release the film in theaters later this year. It will also screen at the Berlinale later this month.', 'It’s difficult to name a more fitting case of “your mileage may vary” at this year’s festival than Bill Condon’s “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” To say reviews were divisive is an understatement — our own IndieWire review (from the great Ryan Lattanzio) isn’t exactly positive (“middling” would be kind), and when I walked out of the film’s Sunday evening premiere at the Eccles Theater, I was immersed in a sea of fellow movie-goers who all had very different feelings about this grand-scale movie musical remake.', 'Personally, I loved it. Musicals should be built on spectacle with a capital “S” (all the better if that “S” is covered in glitter), and Condon takes that all a step farther by also building it on another big “S”: Star Power. Jennifer Lopez was born to play the made-up movie star Ingrid Luna (who also plays dual roles in the movie-within-a-movie that girds the film, including the titular Spider Woman), and to say I was dazzled every time she was on screen doesn’t cut it. I was all in. Just as enthralling? Breakout discovery Tonatiuh as the soft-hearted movie lover Molina, who is trapped in a prison cell with the seemingly hardened political prisoner Valentin (Diego Luna). As Molina spins his web — movies, emotions, music, and more — every night to his reticent pal, who wouldn’t be swept away? —KE', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', '“Beef” executive producer Alex Russell makes his feature filmmaking debut with “Lurker,” “an unsettling thriller starring the great rising actor Théodore Pellerin as a young man obsessed with an L.A. pop star, played by talented “Saltburn” breakout Archie Madekwe. Matthew’s (Pellerin) attachment to Oliver (Madekwe) at first seems innocent, even if he’s being exploited by Oliver’s groupies as a photographer who could potentially direct the musician’s videos or a documentary about his career. But the obsession turns dangerous and potentially career-killing in this spare, sharp first film shot on location in Los Angeles and evocative of all the city’s dreamers and hangers-on, in a place where you are defined not by who you are but by what you do. And who, however ruinously, you want to become. —RL ', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'Shot almost entirely by police body cams and interrogation room CCTVs, Geeta Gandbhir’s unforgettable documentary crystallizes the horrors of stand-your-ground laws by examining their effects through the lens of a single case — one that harrowingly illustrates the defects of castle doctrines (among other policy failures) by painting a microcosmic portrait of white America’s inability to parse between fear and anger. ', 'Stand-your-ground laws aren’t even mentioned by name until “The Perfect Neighbor” is more than half over, as Gandbhir elects to work the issue from the inside out, with the you-are-there reality of the footage she uses bringing viewers right into the heart of what’s ultimately a human matter. Indeed, a subjective camera has seldom been more damning than it is here — here, in an American horror story that doesn’t hinge on whether or not white Florida woman Susan Lorincz was actually in danger when she fired on the unarmed neighbor knocking at her front door, but rather on whether or not Susan Lorincz believed she was in danger when the young Black mother from across the street, Ajike Owens, came to retrieve her son’s confiscated tablet. ', 'The callous indifference that’s coded into the body cam aesthetic collides with the intimate proximity of watching an officer tell the father of Owens’ children that she’s gone, and then listening (from just a few inches away) as the man relays that message to his newly motherless kids. The disparity between what the law permits from some and deprives of others has seldom been rendered as devastatingly as it is here. “Are you hurt?,” a police officer asks one of Owens’ sons. “No,” he cries, “but my heart is broken.” Your heart will be too. —DE', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution. The film will screen at SXSW in March.', 'Ben Whishaw again proves himself as the brilliant actor we all knew he was, if we were looking closely enough, in Ira Sachs’ “Peter Hujar’s Day.” The film, set in 1974 New York City, is an intimate two-hander starring just Whishaw and Rebecca Hall as gay photographer Peter Hujar and writer Linda Rosenkrantz, respectively. They gathered, it’s true, on a cold day in December, where Hujar recounts all the events of the previous one, which involved photo opportunities with Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, and a lot of quotidian nothingness. But those small moments of a day grow profound as Peter’s winding monologue wears on. Writer/director Sachs’ extraordinary new movie never breaks from the pair, and at times becomes like a documentary about the greatness of the actors themselves, Mozart possessing the soundtrack as Sachs and cinematographer Alex Ashe take longing, lingering B-roll of the performers. —RL ', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution. The film will screen at the Berlinale later this month.', 'A raw and riveting documentary that skeptically re-examines the appeal, legacy, and ethicality of “To Catch a Predator,” David Osit’s “Predators” certainly doesn’t make the case that the child predators featured on the show were undeserving of scorn (and in profound need of help). And yet, as both a filmmaker whose work (“Mayor,” “Thank You for Playing”) has always been compelled by moral inquiry, as well as a person for whom “To Catch a Predator” triggered a swirl of conflicting emotions, Osit is haunted by his enjoyment of a show that was ultimately less interested in crime than punishment. Hansen’s theatrics helped paved the way for a media landscape driven by humiliation rituals, and “Predators” leverages the success of that NBC program — along with the tragedy of how it ended, and the YouTube vigilantes who’ve iterated on its format with even less oversight than Hansen ever had — into a probing investigation of its own. ', 'The film’s ultimate conclusion is clear from the start: “To Catch a Predator” was an invitation to see the world in black-and-white, a prospect which has only become more enticing in light of America’s subsequent chaos. It was an invitation to tar and feather people so plainly “evil” that everyone watching along at home couldn’t help but to feel “good” by comparison. And though it sold itself as an invitation to make sense of an inexplicable wrong, the show’s power was rooted in the permission it gave us to ignore why such heinous violations continue to happen.', 'As “Predators” makes clear, there are very real consequences to presenting dehumanization as a righteous act of public justice. “To Catch a Predator” might seem like the wrong lens through which to make that case, as few people invite less sympathy than the men who found their way into Hansen’s web. But that is exactly what makes Osit’s film such a powerful indictment of the lens through which we’ve since been conditioned to see everything else as well. —DE', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'Loath as I am to label anything as “the movie people need right now,” it’s hard to think of Max Walker-Silverman’s “Rebuilding” in any other terms at the moment. A spare but deeply felt sketch of a drama about a divorced Colorado rancher (a hangdog Josh O’Connor) trying to make sense of what he’s got left in the wake of a devastating wildfire, the story is every bit as gentle as the rest of Walker-Silverman’s work (i.e. 2022’s “A Love Song”), and yet still honest enough to reckon with the heartache of losing one’s home. In fact, it’s only because “Rebuilding” is so raw in its pain that it’s able to resolve into such an effectively comforting balm; the film begins with generations of memory smoldering into 1,000 acres of scorched earth, and from the ashes rescues a new foundation on which its characters might credibly be able to create the next iteration of their lives. ', 'How do you build something that lasts in a world where climate change can, has, and will continue to wipe centuries of history right off the map? When the threat of another tragic wildfire is not a matter of “if,” but “when?” “It’s funny,” someone says, “the things you pack and the things you leave.” This quietly affecting little movie finds real poignancy in paying attention to what those things are, and — ultimately — in forging them together so that someone else might have the gift of mourning these ruins one day. —DE', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'In Brittany Shyne’s gorgeous documentary “Seeds” the camera often captures parts of her subjects others might ignore. ', 'Shyne, who also serves as cinematographer, focuses on hands, weathered with creases. She looks at hair, washed in a sink. She lovingly lingers on ash dangling off a cigarette and the worn toes of boots. Shyne’s powerful eye is one of the reasons “Seeds,” a lyrical portrait of Black farmers in the American South, is one of the must-see documentaries at Sundance, and will continue to be vital once released for a broader audience. ', 'Captured in exquisite black and white, Shyne creates a moving testament to a dwindling population. The world of these landowners is threatened by discrimination and government ignorance. But “Seeds” is not all that concerned with statistics, though they are shared in passing. Shyne makes a forceful argument through just letting the audience be absorbed with a way of life. “Seeds” requires patience; you have to orient yourself to the slow rhythms of the piece, which encourage you to relish in these quiet moments. But it’s an incredibly rewarding journey, a film indebted to the past that feels brilliantly alive. —EZ', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'Let’s hear it for concise loglines. Consider the first film from Eva Victor, comedian and social media star, who makes an absolutely major debut with her “Sorry, Baby.” Per official press materials and Sundance releases, the film’s synopsis is: “Something bad happened to Agnes. But life goes on… for everyone around her, at least.” Both simple and secretive, hinting at drama and revelations, and promising to root us firmly in Agnes’ world.', 'That’s certainly all true of “Sorry, Baby,” but no quick hit of words could ever accurately convey the power and potency of Victor’s debut, a darkly funny and enormously tender film that, yes, is about what happens after the worst occurs, but with plenty of room to weave the light next to the dark. Something bad happens to Agnes, but Victor is a wise enough creator to understand that’s only part of the story, because that’s only part of life itself. And while Victor’s film might be rooted specifically in Agnes’ story and the bad thing at its center, in its specificity, there’s still tremendous room for wider recognition and and revelation. —KE', 'How to see it: A24 will release the film in theaters later this year.', 'The existential apocalypse of a Turkish literature professor gets an oblique and chilling study in “The Things You Kill.” On its surface, this disquieting diptych about male anxiety has the feel of, say, an Asghar Farhadi movie, a moral dilemma urging forth a thriller plot. But that’s precisely the sort of bait-and-switch Iranian writer/director Alireza Khatami is operating on here, until his tense and nightmarish film starts to resemble more something like David Lynch’s “Lost Highway” as directed by Abbas Kiarostami. Khatami (“Terrestrial Verses”), who lives in Canada, relocated the setting from Iran to Turkey to evade censorship in his native country — a censorship of patriarchal violence that the film itself also rings upon like a warning bell of a bleak future. “The Things You Kill” is like a bad, sweat-breaking dream that leaves you dazed and feverish — and a black-hearted gaze into the poison patriarchy oozing into men’s veins just as much as women. —RL ', 'How to see it: Still seeking distribution.', 'A black and cursed cloud — a vector of misfortune — follows Idaho day laborer Robert Grainier in director Clint Bentley’s elegantly crafted and ruminating Denis Johnson adaptation, “Train Dreams.” Beginning with a POV shot of a cut tree dropping dead to the ground, the camera fixed to where the fir was felled, this 20th-century portrait of the Pacific Northwest weaves much pain and suffering in the life of Grainier, played with a hardened soul by a bearded Joel Edgerton. Robert goes from day laborer to Spokane railroad logger, perennially tested by a nature that seems to have more control over human destiny than people themselves do. Co-written by Bentley with Greg Kwedar (the primary creative team behind “Sing Sing”), “Train Dreams” thrives on its philosophical inquiries into the earthly randomness of events that make up a life. The effect — amplified by skillful craftsmanship and a fondness for detail in even the most out-of-focus corners of a shot — leaves you winded. —RL ', 'How to see it: It will be available to stream on Netflix later this year, presumably after screening for a week in a very small handful of theaters.', 'It’s hard to write — and direct, produce, and star in — something with a great premise. It’s probably even harder to junk that premise after 20 pages in favor of committing to a different one altogether. But James Sweeney’s “Twinless” is a film that hinges on the suppleness of the stories we tell about ourselves (among several other things), and this confident, clever, and cuttingly dark comedy almost never misses a chance to indulge in the courage of its convictions, especially when those convictions feel oh so wrong.', '“Twinless” introduces itself as a light but mordant bromance about the friendship that develops between two boys who’ve both lost their identical brothers: A chronically straight mouth-breather named Roman (Dylan O’Brien), and a droll and calculating twink named Dennis (Sweeney). These two might not have been friends in any other circumstance, but it’s easy to appreciate why these grieving strangers are drawn to each other when they meet at a support group for twinless twins, in that they each fill the role of the sibling they lost. Cue: Grocery shopping dates, late night gab seshes, and even a road trip to a Kraken game in Seattle. It’s funny, it’s adorable, and it’s probably enough to have sustained a spiky 90-minute charmer that appealed to a broad cross-section of young viewers. ', 'It’s also not the movie that Sweeney wanted to make, and “Twinless” is all the better for that. Lest we ruin any of the story’s devious twists, let’s just that it makes a sharp and shrewdly executed swerve away from Apatow and towards Almodóvar or De Palma — less florid and operatic than such lofty comparisons might suggest, but just as eager to relish in the psychosexual foibles of its characters. And that relishing is exactly what Sweeney does best. —DE', 'How to see it: Paramount’s acquisition label Republic Pictures owns the rights, though its plans for the film are currently unknown.', 'By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

10 Great Performances from Sundance 2025,https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals/10-great-performances-from-sundance-2025,"['Festivals & Awards', 'We asked our team in Park City to pick out some of the best performances they saw out of this year’s Sundance Film Festival. This is in no way comprehensive as we limited ourselves to one performance per film and saw at least a dozen more we would have liked to include. While it may not have been the best Sundance, it was a truly strong one for the art of acting, as evidenced by the ten turns below, in alphabetical order:', 'Alison Brie & Dave Franco in “Together”', 'Is it cheating to put these two in one entry? If one film allows such editorial chicanery, it’s this one in that what real-life partners Brie & Franco do in this film is a dual performance in which the success of one is inextricable from the other. The story of a couple who end up being physically unable to extract one from the other placed incredible demands on whoever would be cast in the leads. To say that Brie and Franco deliver on expectations would be an understatement. These are two performances sure to be underrated at the end of the year—horror often is, especially when it’s tinged with comedy as much as this flick—but they are also two of the most physical performances you’ll see this year. Brie and Franco were willing to go dark places emotionally and physically in this film, and their work paid off with the highest sale out of Sundance this year—Neon will release the film on August 1. Mark your calendar. – Brian Tallerico', 'Rose Byrne in “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”', 'In writer/director Mary Bronstein’s overwhelming psychological drama “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” Rose Byrne as Linda—a working mother caring for her ailing daughter—offers a full-frontal assault on the senses. See, the camera almost never leaves Byrne’s eye-level. We never really see Linda’s daughter; we only hear her cries and pleas, whose high-pitch sound seems to only grow in intensity. We never really see Linda’s demanding husband (Christian Slater); we only hear his voice. While Linda’s work as a therapist brings her into contact with a cast of characters, each struggling in their daily lives, she also visits another therapist (Conan O’Brien) down the hall for guidance. Much like Linda is never away from the turbulence of motherhood, we are never away from her. And Byrne earns our attention. Watching her energy, the shape of her face and the wisps of her hair tangle and recede is like seeing a boxer take a 12-round beating. Except in her case, there is no bell to end it all. It’s the never-ending onslaught of parenthood whose emotional and psychological bruises are evident on every surface of a performance that isn’t so much brittle. It’s the physical manifestation of someone in need of care herself. – Robert Daniels', 'Joel Edgerton in “Train Dreams”', 'Clint Bentley’s adaptation of the novella of the same name by Denis Johnson is the kind of film that can sometimes disguise mediocre acting. It’s such a gorgeously shot movie, and the score is simply lovely, that one could just get lost in the sights and sounds without considering the performances, and probably walk away satisfied. Joel Edgerton doesn’t let that happen. Working with Bentley, he crafts a fully-realized character, a man we come to know, care about, and maybe even see some of ourselves in. Playing the same man over decades of his life allows Edgerton to do arguably the best film acting work of his notable career (at least the best since “Loving”), finding the extraordinary in an ordinary life. Edgerton’s role requires both subtle quietude as a man of few words, and deep emotional wells as a man who suffers unimaginable grief. There’s an image late in “Train Dreams” in which Edgerton’s logger sees his face in the mirror for the first time in a decade, startled at the life looking back at him. It’s a moment that works because of what Edgerton has put into the film to this point, crafting a character of such depth that it’s not just a reflection but an image of a full, believable life. This is one of the best films of my 13 years covering Sundance, and it requires every element to work, arguably none more than the performance that carries us through almost every scene. – BT', 'Tim Key in “The Ballad of Wallis Island”', 'In James Griffiths’ witty folk comedy “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” Tim Key is Charles, a two-time lottery winner living on a remote isle who invites the estranged folk duo Herb McGwyer (Tom Basden) and Nell Mortimer (Carey Mulligan) to his country manor to perform. Despite Charles’ wealth, he’s a normal, lovable guy bordering on being a nuisance. Underneath his annoying prodding and his offputting fandom for Herb and Nell, however, Charles possesses a deep well of hurt. For Key, a television character actor best known for the “Alan Partridge” series, his turn as Charles stands as a breakout role. As Charles, Key’s soft-heartedness often recalls John Candy in “Planes, Trains and Automobiles,” another performance built on a lonely man painfully searching for some human connection. Like Candy, Key is a light-footed physical comedian with a quick delivery, who knows how to deliver unassumingly crushing beats and nods that crack open the surface of his character. By the time “The Ballad of Wallis Island” ends, you wish you could spend several movies with Key as Charles. – RD', 'Dylan O’Brien in “Twinless”', 'Fifteen years after breaking out with roles on the MTV series “Teen Wolf” and the “Maze Runner” YA film trilogy, star Dylan O’Brien has eked out an intriguing career in smaller, idiosyncratic, character-driven films. He’s brought an intense energy and complexity to each role he’s chosen in projects as diverse in plot and genre as Taylor Swift’s short film “All Too Well,” the neon-soaked noir “Ponyboi,” the emotional time-bender “Caddo Lake,” and now this year’s Sundance breakout “Twinless.” In the latter, O’Brien is tasked with playing the dual roles of flamboyantly gay and fiercely intelligent Rocky and his more stoic, simple, but sweet brother Roman. Early in the film, Rocky is hit with a car and killed, sending Roman on a spiral that lands him in a support group for twinless twins. There he meets Dennis (the film’s writer-director James Sweeney), and soon the two form a special bond, that is until a dark secret is revealed. The trick O’Brien must pull off here is to make Rocky so dynamic that his absence is deeply felt throughout the film’s run time, while also leaving room to shed layers of vulnerability as Roman both becomes closer to Dennis and also learns more about his deceased brother. O’Brien lands this with aplomb, holding back one last emotional beat for the film’s stunning final scene that left me crying happy little tears. I can’t wait to see what project O’Brien chooses next. – Marya E. Gates', 'Josh O’Connor in “Rebuilding”', 'Josh O’Connor continues to make the case for smartest actor of his generation, refusing to go traditional routes to stardom as he focuses on character instead of the box office potential of his films. From his early days in another Sundance breakout, “God’s Own Country,” one could tell that O’Connor had something special. It’s in his range, able to play traditionally handsome and grounded everyman in back-to-back roles, sometimes even in the same film. In that sense, he recalls the great performers of the ‘70s in his unpredictability. He feels like a true heir to the leads who helped shape that era, echoing a young Robert De Niro or Harvey Keitel in his ability to hold the camera like an undeniable movie star while also digging so much into character that he disappears into roles. His latest finds him playing a Colorado rancher who struggles to find the next step after his family ranch burns to the ground in a wildfire. O’Connor understands the kind of guy who doesn’t say much, certainly not about his own feelings, portraying him almost as a ghost looking for his human form again. A tender, nuanced portrait of fatherhood and resilience, “Rebuiilding” is one of the most moving films of Sundance 2025, and none of it works at all if we don’t believe the performance at its center. He never strikes a false note in a drama that will feel even more personal to those impacted by the California wildfires. Really it will touch anyone whose life has been derailed in ways they could never have expected and give hope to those trying to figure out what to do next in their own lives. – BT', 'Tonatiuh in “Kiss of the Spider Woman”', 'When Sundance announced Bill Condon’s “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” they highlighted the film’s principal trio in Jennifer Lopez, Diego Luna, and Tonatiuh. Two of those three are household names and one is one of the most famous people on Earth. And yet Tonatiuh is the star of this film, in screen time, and, however improbable it may seem given his costars, in wattage as well. His voice reverberates out of the film, a glowing warm tone and subtle vibrato. It’s hard to dance next to Jennifer Lopez, but he holds his own in dapper suits and slicked-back hair. Throughout the film’s 128 minutes, he gives each of his various parts–narrator, revolutionary, stylist, assistant, prisoner, traitor, lover–a glint of magic. By the end, he’s alone, holding the final third of the film. His character’s story is both triumphant and tragic and Tonatiuh had the Sundance audience completely transfixed. This is a breakout performance of a generational talent. It’s hard to out-charisma Luna and Lopez, but Tonatiuh did it in a way that perfectly fit his film, his character, and our moment. – Cristina Escobar', 'Eva Victor in “Sorry, Baby”', 'Eva Victor asks a lot of themself in “Sorry, Baby.” For one, this is their first produced feature-length script. Secondly, it’s their feature directorial debut. It’s also their first starring role in a film. But you wouldn’t know that while watching “Sorry, Baby.” The satirist known for their viral Twitter/X presence offers a controlled effort in a film that is about anything but control. In this wry, aching picture, Victor is Agnes, a professor at a small northeastern liberal arts college processing the still-potent memories of her sexual assault. Victor’s script follows a nonlinear structure, separated by Didion-inspired title cards whose freewheeling narrative movement can somewhat obscure her slight yet impactful calibrations. Along with delivering sharpened zingers, critiquing the ambivalent responses people have to their rape, they offer a physically commanding performance. Agnes stands, sits and carries herself differently before and after the traumatic event, alternating between supreme confidence and quiet hesitation. Take the moment she happens upon a cat, stomping down the street closed off to the world until she is literally shaken, then rendered limber again by the sound of a feline. That balance by Victor, a person living through but not defined by her trauma, makes for one of the year’s most devastating performances. – RD', 'Ben Whishaw in “Peter Hujar’s Day”', 'The quiet pleasure of Ira Sachs’ new film “Peter Hujar’s Day” rests on the shoulders of its title character brought to life by Ben Whishaw. The film’s premise is simple: artist Linda Rosenkrantz (Rebecca Hall) interviews photographer Peter Hujar (Whishaw) about his previous day for a project. Their taped 1974 conversation provides dialogue, but it’s Whishaw who carries most of the conversation. His day is full of banal observations and lists of chores as well as name-dropping greats of the era like Allen Ginsberg and Susan Sontag alongside hearty doses of gossip from their scene. Whishaw lies about Hujar’s apartment in the company of his friend, breathlessly delivering the details with equal amounts of amusement and boredom. His delivery feels so lived in, so casual, like any conversation you might walk in on a lazy, sun-strewn Sunday afternoon. They eat, they move from the couch to the bedroom, back to the dining table, all the while Whishaw is reminiscing and ruminating on the day’s events. It’s an impressive performance for its understated mastery. At the Q&A after the film’s premiere at Sundance, Whishaw said his role was 55 pages, the majority of the movie’s brief runtime, making “Peter Hujar’s Day” a technical wonder not just because of Sachs’ gorgeous direction and 16mm cinematography, but also because of Whishaw’s refined performance. – Monica Castillo', 'Youn Yuh-jung in “The Wedding Banquet”', 'One of the great strengths of Andrew Ahn’s “The Wedding Banquet” is how it adds nuance to the anxieties and trepidations faced by those in AAPI communities. And it is in Oscar winner Youn Yuh-jung’s role that Ahn shades longstanding (and truthful) archetypes with warmth, depth and surprise. By embodying Ja-Young as someone sensitive and acute, able to read through the flimsily fabricated lies that often characterize social interaction, Youn’s performance unlocks a more emotional layer to this story; it becomes less about whether or not Ja-Young will find out her grandson Min’s secret, but how they’ll reconcile years of mistrust that calcified into their present dynamic. When Youn breathes or simply stares at all that’s unfolding, there’s a sense that she’s actively feeling the weight of all her past histories and traumas; she moves with an ache that can’t be traced back to any one thing. Her role of a laconic grandmother may be an all too familiar depiction for those who come from families where love manifested in actions, not words, but Youn plays Ja-Young’s silence with tender intentionality. Her curiosity is a way she loves, and though she has a hard time accepting Min’s choices, her initial disproval isn’t a barrier to the union but instead an opportunity to care for her grandson more deeply. Youn and Han’s dynamic is beautiful and an all-too-rare on-screen depiction of reconciliation and conversation between the older and younger generations. She reminds me that paying attention and entering into a space with curiosity for someone’s story is the greatest gift one can offer. – Zachary Lee', 'Brian Tallerico is the Managing Editor of RogerEbert.com, and also covers television, film, Blu-ray, and video games.

THR Critics Pick the 15 Best Films of Sundance 2025,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/2025-sundance-film-festival-critics-pick-best-films-1236120622/,"['', '', 'A sexy gay cruising thriller, an all-too-timely drama about post-wildfire recovery and a shocking doc about U.S. prisons are among our critics’ faves from the fest.', '', '', 'Relying heavily on footage shot by inmates on prohibited cellphones, Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman’s powerful and gripping documentary isn’t an easy watch, but it’s a crucial one. The film’s focus is on corruption and abuses of power specific to Alabama’s prisons — and the heroism of the men who have found ways to evolve within a system that has no interest in participating in their rehabilitation and denies their basic humanity in every way. — DANIEL FIENBERG', 'Before his death in 1963, scholar W.E.B. Du Bois spent decades trying to publish an encyclopedia about people of African descent. That mission propels Kahlil Joseph’s hypnotic debut feature — a kinetic video essay blending Afro-futurist narrative, archival footage and memoir — that’s like an index of Black culture from the past 50 years. Joseph animates the fictional story of a journalist reporting on a transatlantic curatorial project with voiceover, captions and a style inspired by auteurs from Jean-Luc Godard to Garrett Bradley. — LOVIA GYARKYE', '', 'The recent banning of books in school libraries — particularly those with LGBTQ- or race-related themes — may no longer feature highly in the headlines given the new president’s tsunami of rights-snuffing executive orders. But it’s still going on. That makes this scrupulously assembled doc from Kim A. Snyder all the more welcome. Seamlessly interweaving vintage film snippets with archival and original footage, the film observes a clutch of educators, almost all women, fighting the bans. It’s an essential chronicle full of drama and despair but also small glimmers of hope. — LESLIE FELPERIN', 'Culled from 40 hours of interviews and thousands of hours of archival footage, Matt Wolf’s HBO two-parter gives Paul Reubens a posthumous spotlight. By making the most of his time with his subject and refusing to sanitize the tone of their interactions, Wolf has created an enlightening and enjoyably confounding portrait of an enjoyably confounding artist. The result stands up well alongside HBO’s recent run of “Difficult Funny Men” documentaries focused on the likes of Garry Shandling and George Carlin. — D.F.', 'In June 2023, Susan Lorincz, a white Floridian, fired a single fatal shot at her Black neighbor Ajike Owens, a mother of four, while the latter was knocking on her front door. Relying on police body camera footage, filmmaker Geeta Gandbhir reconstructs a timeline of the events that led to that day, observing a quiet community torn apart by a festering feud. It’s a propulsive account of racist paranoia, police inertia and the consequences of America’s Stand Your Ground laws. — L.G.', '', 'A uniquely beautiful experiment in big-screen biography, Ira Sachs’ character study is constructed from rediscovered tapes of a 1974 conversation between gay photographer Peter Hujar (Ben Whishaw) and his friend Linda Rosenkrantz (Rebecca Hall) for a book project. Led by Whishaw’s transfixing performance, the diaristic film spins compacted time into something free- flowing, expansive, illuminating and emotionally resonant, all of it achieved with elegant restraint. — DAVID ROONEY', 'A movie palpably real for those of us who can remember years of shame, fear and secrecy, first-time writer-director Carmen Emmi’s ’90s-set thriller follows a cop assigned to a sting operation, arresting gay men cruising for sex in a Syracuse mall. His willingness to pose as bait dissolves when he starts facing his own sexual identity while getting obsessive about a similarly closeted hookup. Strong turns by Tom Blyth and Russell Tovey keep you glued to this sexy, sad, authentically gritty drama. — D.R.', 'Directors Lindsay Utz and Michelle Walshe’s doc about Jacinda Ardern is a timely and bracingly intimate portrait of a woman in power, examining the left-wing prime minister’s work and life choices during her five-year term as New Zealand’s galvanizing head of government. Deftly editing together home videos, candid contemporaneous interviews and archival news clips, the film offers a rare firsthand look at the toll and demands on politicians when crises come flying at them. — CARYN JAMES', '', 'Working in his native Colorado, as he did in his debut, A Love Song, Max Walker-Silverman again conjures a potent visual language from the landscape. This time, though, the vista is scarred by a devastating wildfire that leaves a rancher named Dusty without a home. The wrenching heart of this quiet drama, he’s played with eloquent understatement by Josh O’Connor, delivering the latest in a remarkable string of performances — and one matched beat for poignant beat by the other members of the cast. — SHERI LINDEN', 'Cristina Costantini’s eye-opening documentary about astronaut Sally Ride beautifully weaves together her personal story, told by the woman who was her partner for 27 years, and a detailed account of the jaw-dropping sexism Ride encountered as the first American woman in space. Affecting and socially relevant, it’s the rare film that is deeply sympathetic but doesn’t sugar-coat its heroine’s sometimes prickly personality. — C.J.', 'Brittany Shyne’s quietly stunning doc observes two Black farmers in the contemporary American South, constructing an empathetic portrait of agrarian life while also revealing threats to its survival. Using a black-and-white palette to gorgeous, pointed effect — a scene of tractors plowing cotton conjures memories of a fraught history because of its resemblance to archival imagery — this is not a journalistic investigation but a poetic contemplation that recalls Garrett Bradley’s indelible Time. — L.G.', '', 'Eva Victor directs, writes and stars in her big-screen debut, about a young New England academic gradually recovering from a sexual assault. It’s a disarmingly frank, intimate spin on the female “traumedy” — perceptive, funny and buoyed by soulful supporting turns from Naomi Ackie as the protagonist’s best friend and Lucas Hedges as her neighbor turned suitor. The film positions Victor as a triple threat, with a specific, fully formed voice blending irony and earnestness to beguiling effect. — JON FROSCH', 'How do you unravel a lie and, harder yet, the official story that’s been built up around it? That’s the question propelling Bao Nguyen’s quiet bombshell of a documentary. At its center is a famous 1972 photo (known as “Napalm Girl”) that became a shot heard round the world during the Vietnam War, and the small team of journalists that set out, 50 years later, to determine whether it was attributed to the wrong photographer. A chronicle of globe-trotting gumshoe reporting, it’s a stirring film less about geopolitics than workplace politics — and ultimately about the knotty bond between the two. — S.L.', 'Clint Bentley’s soulful drama about an early 20th century logger in the Pacific Northwest has been beautifully adapted from Denis Johnson’s novella. Never page-bound, the story is shaped by superb acting and finely etched characters — lead Joel Edgerton gives perhaps the best performance of his career, and co-star Felicity Jones is luminous — that seem to have been lifted from a long-ago time, with faces right out of a Walker Evans catalog. It’s a ravishing, perfectly formed film that elevates Bentley (Jockey) into the league of essential American filmmakers. — D.R.', '', 'A high-wire act of humor and compassion, James Sweeney’s sly and stirring charmer revolves around two young men (played by Dylan O’Brien and Sweeney himself) who form an unusual friendship at a twin bereavement support group. O’Brien does impressive double duty as the irascible protagonist and, in flashbacks, his extroverted gay brother, and the gripping screenplay is pocked with withering observations on grief and loneliness as well as a handful of clever twists. — L.G.', 'This story appeared in the Jan. 29 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

What’s Left To Say About Sundance?,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sundance-film-festival-2025-highs-lows-1236123863/,"['', '', 'The industry has always looked to the fest to give it something new —  a director, star, film, etc. Now, Sundance can present us with something else new — itself.', 'BY MIA GALUPPO', '', 'What can I say about Sundance this year that hasn’t already been said?', 'Yes, the line-up lacked commercial offerings, and was filled with small films from first time directors. Yes, the festival felt subdued with less star power than years past. Yes, there was still inexplicably an hour-and-a-half wait for the most subpar avocado toast you have ever had in your life. And, yes, it still cost you $40, even though your boss warned you to keep expenses down.', 'As compared to years past, this year’s Sundance felt like a turning point, with a collective acceptance that the festival’s time in Park City has run its course.', '', 'During last year’s fest, then-CEO Joana Vicente first floated that the festival could (would) be moving after its contract was up with Park City in 2026. At the time, there was the requisite gnashing of teeth. “What is Sundance without Park City?” many asked. People shared favorite screening stories. Stories where a filmmaker’s life was changed forever, and waxed poetic about distributors running out mid-screening to plead their cases for acquiring eventual hit.', 'One year (and one new CEO later) the executives and reps I talk to in 2025 are seemingly too tired to plumb the depths of their nostalgia in the face of a couple thousand in hotel charges.', 'Now, many are ready to ship out to Salt Lake, Boulder or Cincinnati. But festival veterans are wary of a bringing Sundance, known for championing diversity of art and thought, to Ohio. Or, as one told me, “I am not going to the state that birthed JD Vance.” But despite housing the fest for four decades, Utah isn’t a bastion of free speech, with the state being one of the first to implement a statewide ban for more than a dozen books in libraries and classrooms. Boulder, on the other hand, is a college town in a largely liberal state, and it may be for this reason, among others, it is rumored as the frontrunner.  ', 'Fair or not, the industry looks to Sundance as the pseudo bellwether for the year, reading headlines about sales in the low-to-mid teens as if they are tea leaves. If we are basing the next twelve months on the past week in Park City, then things are pretty bleak. There have only been two major reported sales. Even if buyers see all films before making their first offer on anything, dealmaking is shaping up to be lack luster.', '', 'There is a general lethargy that can’t be blamed on any one programmer, line-up or festival. The industry is still reeling from a 2024 of record low production. Pending mergers and acquisitions are still keeping studios from having solid foundations on which to build slates. And Sundance landed a couple of weeks into a year that has already seen Los Angeles face one of its most devastating natural disasters. Filmmakers, execs and reps came to Park City after they lost their homes.', 'And, of course, there is Trump. In 2017 Chelsea Handler, Laura Dern and Charlize Theron led thousands of participants down Main Street in the festival’s very own Women’s March after Donald Trump took office for his first term. After Trump took office for his second term this year, a group of around 60 danced in a flash mob to help advertise their indie television series, Chasers, and wore pink “pussy” hats as a well-intentioned if not depressing homage to that day eight years ago.', 'While there were moments during this year’s fest that heeded to the excitement, absurdity and just plain fun that Sundance can be — Jennifer Lopez getting into the DJ booth at Tao or Eva Victor making their directorial debut to universal acclaim — this year proved that Sundance needs a change.', 'Am I going to miss the teens at the Eccles concession stand talking about their chemistry quiz? Absolutely! Am I going to miss subsisting on Snickers from that concession stand because there is absolutely nowhere to get a quick meal. No!', '', 'One producer who has premiered several films in Park City noted to me that Sundance is, by and large, the only festival that filmmakers are expected to outgrow.

The 12 Sundance Movies With the Brightest Awards Futures,https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-12-sundance-movies-with-the-brightest-awards-futures,"['The sentiment on the ground at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, America’s premier showcase for new independent cinema, was that something was off. A combination of the wildfires in Los Angeles, the dawning of a second Trump administration, and a sluggish sales market made for a more muted affair than usual. Buzz was minimal, moods were distracted and worried, and there were frustrations over scheduling—some of the best movies on offer were held until the second half of the festival.', 'Though awards potential is not terribly high on Sundance’s list of concerns, further troubling the Park City air for some attendees was that in 2025, no major awards contender seemed to emerge—like A Real Pain did last year, or Past Lives the year before. (At least in the scripted sector; the documentaries are likely a different story.) This heightens the concern that too many of these movies, which took so much scrambling to get made at all, will have trouble finding audiences upon release. Cynical as it may often be, awards chatter does at least raise the profile of some titles. (At least some of Sundance’s horror movies—like big-seller Together—ought to do fine either way.)', 'But Sundance 2025 wasn’t a total wash in that regard. The festival did premiere a few movies that could forge a circuitous path toward the attention of awards-giving bodies, if given the right roll-out. Let’s take a look at the just-maybe-if-we’re-lucky contenders that premiered at Sundance this year.', 'While Mary Bronstein’s relentlessly stressful descent into motherhood hell is a really difficult watch, it’s impossible to look away from Rose Byrne’s ferocious, tireless performance. As a Long Island therapist unraveling over the course of a few months, Byrne is breathtaking: funny, furious, heartsick. It’s bold, full-bodied work, the kind that typically gets the attention of the Academy. The question, though, is whether that tremendous work is housed in the right kind of movie. A bleak and routinely grating film about a parent making lots of mistakes might prove too alienating for the Academy; after all, they didn’t recognize Amy Adams for the comparatively much softer Nightbitch. But we’re hopeful that a smart campaign can be mounted anyway. Byrne is long overdue for that kind of recognition, and If I Had Legs I’d Kick You is maybe her best chance yet.', 'This film may be more in line with the Spirit Awards than, say, the Oscars, but we can’t really know for certain when the Academy has been so rapidly mutating in recent years. Writer-director-star Eva Victor’s melancholy dramedy was the most exciting debut film I saw at the festival this year, a smart and idiosyncratic contemplation of the aftermath of sexual assault. Sorry, Baby, which won the screenplay award at Sundance on Friday, will certainly be a contender with critics groups for its writing, acting, and direction, a feat of auteurism that mightily succeeds where so many other ambitious films fail. (Some directors just can’t write. Some writers can’t direct. And most of either can’t act.) Sorry, Baby may ultimately be too small, too intimate to compete with flashier, more star-driven titles. But if a drumbeat starts now, maybe it will eventually grow too loud to ignore.', 'Netflix just acquired this decades-spanning period drama for a sum said to be in the “high-teens millions.” That’s a big number for a movie that, while shot beautifully and given palpable humanity by lead actor Joel Edgerton, is not terribly plot-heavy. But the streamer must see something sellable in Clint Bentley’s despondent Western. It has the necessary visual sweep to merit as prestige, and its portrait of grief and the changing nature of American life in the first half of the 20th century may be powerful enough to hook voters. Train Dreams is not exactly The Brutalist in terms of complex ideas, but its moving ending casts what’s come before in a grand sort of light. I’d say it would be wise to aim for an acclaim-boosting second festival stop at Cannes—audiences there would no doubt appreciate the film’s pensive and lyrical version of Americana. But Netflix is effectively barred from that festival. Oh well.', 'If this musical were to get any kind of awards recognition outside of technical categories, it would likely be for Jennifer Lopez’s sultry turn as a 1950s screen icon haunting the memory and fantasy of an imprisoned gay man in 1980s Argentina. Lopez sings, dances, and slinks effectively; it might be the stuff of Golden Globes dreams. She’d surely run in lead there, but vexingly would probably have a better shot at the Oscars in supporting. How that quandary is handled will be up to whoever buys the film—no sale has been announced yet.', 'Dylan O’Brien, co-star of the sad, biting comedy Twinless, won a special jury prize at Sundance for his performance. And for good reason: he’s brilliant in two roles, vastly different from one another. Twinless is not an Oscar movie, I don’t think, but perhaps the right distributor could keep O’Brien in the mix for Spirits and critics prizes. I hope for a similar fate (if not more) for Ben Whishaw’s terrific performance in Ira Sach’s Peter Hujar’s Day, a tiny conversation movie that nonetheless feels awfully cinematic, thanks in large part to Whishaw’s fluid, natural work. Stephan James is also quite strong in Ricky (which won the Sundance directing prize for Rashad Frett), even if the larger film is a tad generic.', 'Four of the films currently nominated for the best documentary Oscar premiered at Sundance last year, yet another indicator that Sundance is perhaps the world’s best launchpad for non-fiction films. This year’s festival had a strong crop as well. Predators is a damning look at the compassionless mechanics behind the grimmest prank show in American history, To Catch a Predator. The Perfect Neighbor assembles heaps of body cam footage to tell a bleak and bitterly sad story about armed, paranoid, racist America. Top doc prize winner Seeds is a stirring, wrenching survey of the history and present-day realities of Black farmers in the American south. Mr. Nobody vs. Putin is a profile of a brave schoolteacher standing up to an oppressive government. And 2000 Meters to Andrivka is director Mstyslav Chernov’s followup to his Oscar-winning Mariupol, another harrowingly up-close immersion into the war in Ukraine. That could easily be your five nominees right there.', 'Inside America’s Most Unconventional Counterterror Squad', 'Beyoncé Wins Big at the 2025 Grammy Awards', 'See the Full List of 2025 Grammy Winners', 'All the Looks From the 2025 Grammys Red Carpet', 'Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Big Business Ambitions, 5 Years After Their Royal Exit', 'See the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'The 10 Biggest Snubs and Surprises From the 2025 Oscar Nominations', 'How the MAGA World Ignited the Obama Divorce Rumors', 'The Sex Abuse Scandal That’s Rocking an Elite Boarding School in the Berkshires', 'Beware the Serial Squatter of Point Dume', 'The Best Rom-Coms of All Time', 'From the Archive: MAGA Non Grata', 'MORE FROM VANITY FAIR', 'CONTACT', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

The intimate drama about a pair of cousins (Culkin and writer-director Jesse Eisenberg) who travel to Poland to see the ancestral home of their grandmother, who left the country during the Holocaust, was one of several buzzy titles to debut at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. It was eventually acquired by Searchlight Pictures, given a platform theatrical release last fall, and feted throughout awards season with honors for Culkin. He’s currently the top pick to win Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars in March, 14 months after his film’s initial debut. Culkin and Eisenberg, a nominee in the Best Original Screenplay category, are just two of several 2024 Sundance standouts that received bids from the Academy this year, including A Different Man (Best Makeup and Hair) and Best Documentary nominees Sugarcane, Black Box Diaries, Porcelain War, and Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat.', '', '', '“We can’t predict Oscar contenders, but it is amazing to see the success of those films,” Sundance Film Festival director Eugene Hernandez told Gold Derby as this year’s event began. But the depth of last year’s lineup went further than just the Oscar nominees, with other buzzy indie titles like Didi, Thelma, Between the Temples, and The Outrun all receiving awards recognition this season. ', '“It’s so exciting for those films and their creators,”  Hernandez added, noting that it isn’t necessarily some special Sundance sauce that keeps the big titles in the cultural conversation for several months.', '“I think it’s the journalists, critics, distributors, and curators who can propel a film to international attention and then sustain the conversation around those films for more than a year,” he explained. “Sundance’s calendar means that we start the year with a new selection every January, even as the industry is still honoring the previous year’s films. So it’s a long road but such a meaningful one when a film clicks and is in the conversation for that long haul.”', 'As this year’s Sundance Film Festival hits the halfway mark, here’s a look at three titles that could continue the festival’s tradition of launching awards contenders.', '', '', 'Undoubtedly the noisest title of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Kiss of the Spider Woman had several viewers pondering its awards prospects after its premiere, with specific attention paid to star Jennifer Lopez. The actress, singer, and tabloid fixture stars as the titular character in Bill Condon’s adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical based on the Manuel Puig 1976 novel. Set in Argentina in 1981, Kiss of the Spider Woman focuses on Luis Molina (breakthrough actor Tonatiuh), a hairdresser who is gay and gets imprisoned because of his sexuality. While in captivity, Molina shares a cell with Valentin (Diego Luna), an ardent Marxist. Lopez plays Ingrid Luna, a classic screen actress and star of musicals whom Molina sees in his fantasies as he tries to escape his current reality.

Diego [Luna] and I were on set, and we danced around, sang, and looked at each other. It was like we didn’t want to do anything else but musicals. Diego said that! Me too. I don’t want to do anything else.”', 'As a property, Kiss of the Spider Woman has a long history of awards success. The novel was initially adapted for the screen in 1985 by filmmaker Héctor Babenco. The film received four Oscar nominations – including Best Picture and Best Director — and won star William Hurt (who played Molina) Best Actor.

It was a dream fulfilled in having done the movie.”', 'From A Real Pain to Past Lives to CODA to Promising Young Woman to Minari to The Father to Get Out to Manchester By the Sea and on down the list, several prominent Oscar winners and nominees in the screenplay categories launched at Sundance. While it’s impossible to say with certainty whether any of this year’s films will join that partial list of recent awards contenders, the current smart money is on Eva Victor’s Sorry, Baby. The film — which was written and directed by Victor, who also stars – has received consistent raves since its Sundance premiere, with most touting its multihyphenate lead as a filmmaker to watch. Set in a small New England college town, Sorry, Baby tells the story of Anges (Victor), a newly minted professor who grapples with a life-altering trauma that occurred when she was a student. Victor’s heartfelt screenplay bounces deftly from wry observations to earnest emotional beats and heralds the writer-director-star — previously best known for Billions, Super Pumped, and viral social media videos — as a talent on the rise. (Reviews have compared the star to Greta Gerwig and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.) Sorry, Baby is without distribution right now, but expect that to change soon enough.', '', '', 'This year, four of the five Best Documentary nominees at the Oscars premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. So it’s best to keep tabs on several non-fiction films in this year’s Sundance lineup when considering next year’s Oscar race. The Alabama Solution, Pee-wee as Himself, Sally, and The Stringer have generated the most buzz thus far.

,https://www.moviejawn.com/home/2025/2/3/sundance-2025,"['by Gary M. Kramer, Staff Writer', 'Attending this year’s Sundance Film Festival from the red carpet of my living room, I was able to screen a dozen features over five days. It’s a marathon, but with so many new and exciting titles available through the festival’s online portal, I am always looking to discover a gem. ', 'Festivals are always a mixed bag as they try to present something for everyone, and I generally watch different genres each day—a documentary followed by an international film before a shorts program, then an indie drama and a midnight movie. This year’s program did not feature any absolute standouts, but most of the films, especially the documentaries, were strong, and many transported me to new worlds full of interesting people, which is why I go to the movies. ', 'Here is a rundown of five notable films I saw at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.', 'Cutting Through Rocks\nDirected by Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni ', 'The title of this remarkable documentary is a metaphor for the difficulties faced by its indomitable subject, Sara Shahverdi, in her remote Iranian village. As the newly elected—and first—councilwoman, Sara wants to use her power for positive change. She proves herself to be a dynamo and a role model in her fight against outdated traditions like having pre-teen girls married off rather than educated. (She even takes in one teenager, Fereshteh, who is seeking a divorce from her husband.) Sara is determined and defiant; she rides a motorcycle, designs her own clothes, has delivered 400 babies as a midwife, and knows construction. She never backs down from a fight and becomes justifiably angry when her plans to build a circular park are “squared,” by a male colleague, or a judge tells her to “accept a situation as it is.” Cutting Through Rocks observes and sides with Sara as she rails against inequality and injustice. In one of the film’s most interesting sequences, she lets a group of young girls experience the freedom of cycling on the open road only to have their ride end with an abusive encounter by one girl’s uncle. The film’s insights into women’s life and culture in Iran are compelling and disturbing, never more so than when a complaint is filed against Sara, that could change her life forever.  This is an immersive and eye-opening film about a woman unafraid to break barriers in a society that is slow to change. It also won the festival’s World Cinema Grand Jury Prize.', 'Didn’t Die\nWritten and Directed by Meera Menon ', 'It is refreshing that Didn’t Die features an Indian American podcaster Vinita (Kiran Deol), battling the undead with her brothers Hari (Samrat Chakrabarti) and Rish (Vishlal Vijayakumar) among others, including her ex, Vincent (George Basil). But it is a shame that this low-budget black-and-white film, directed and cowritten by Meera Menon, is so uneven. The plot has the zombies, known as “biters,” evolving and starting to attack during daylight, but the action scenes are shot and edited in such a disjointed way they won’t please die-hard genre fans. It is also hard to care about who survives since the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Vinita cracks wise—“Less biters, more orgies!”—but her deadpan humor fails to amuse. Her enemies-to-lovers romance with Vincent also feels more contrived than meaningful. There are some nice touches, however, like Hari and his wife Barbara (Katie McCuen) coping with quarantine by dressing up for cocktail hour. And the film’s messages about maintaining family and community rather than being alone resonate in the age of COVID—as does the film’s ideas about sacrifice and survivor’s guilt. But Menon’s use of footage of Vinita’s family from happier times as well as a coda, shot in color, come off as pretentious, not poignant. Didn’t Die has the bones for a good film but it feels like a draft rather than a finished product. ', 'How to Build a Library \nDirected by Maia Lekow and Christopher King ', 'How to Build a Library is an inspiring documentary that chronicles the years-long effort (starting in 2017) of two women, Shiro Koinange and Angela Wachuka, to revitalize the McMillan Memorial Library and two of its branches in Nairobi. Their task is an uphill climb as the project requires considerable funding as well as negotiations with (and concessions to) the government. The are other political issues in the important decolonization work Shiro and Wachuka and their team are doing; the McMillan Library was restricted as Whites only until 1958. Should they rename the building after an African? Is using the Dewey Decimal System, which marginalizes African languages and feminism, appropriate? The film is strongest when it probes these issues and makes a case for acquiring and classifying books that reflect the library’s users. It is gratifying to hear one man enthuse about the smell of the books and the ideas they provide, or when the women ask mothers what needs their children might have. How to Build a Library generates excitement as progress is made and funding is secured. And the film engages viewers by raising questions about legacy as the team finds a photo of the first Black hanging, or when a VIP visit prompts a discussion about contemporary colonization. Shiro and Wachuka are passionate advocates as they face myriad challenges, successes, and setbacks in the efforts to achieve their goal. Watching them and their commitment is what makes How to Build a Library both admirable and engrossing.', 'Ricky \nWritten and Directed by Rashad Frett ', 'Writer/director Rashad Frett’s promising feature debut, expanded from his 2023 short, has 30-year-old Ricardo (Stephan James), struggling to adjust to life outside after 15 years of incarceration. Ricardo encounters trouble just walking home from work, and he faces pressure from his parole officer Joanne (Sheryl Lee Ralph) to toe the line. When he unexpectedly loses his job, Ricardo tries to avoid free falling into a downward spiral, but forces frequently conspire against him. In one of the film’s most intense sequences, his efforts to get to a parole meeting on time involves numerous complications and setbacks.', 'While the screenplay can sometimes be didactic, and the story is familiar, James elevates the material with his riveting performance. It is absolutely heartbreaking when he admits, “I just never thought I’d live this long.” Frett shoots Ricky as if it were a nature documentary, studying his title character up close and in his environment. As Ricardo forms relationships with Jaz (Imani Lewis) and Cheryl (Andrene Ward-Hammond), and deals with his put-upon mother (Simba Kali), he wants to do right, but circumstances just work against him. Ricky can feel contrived as the drama escalates, and Ricardo gets caught in a series of untenable situations but forget the narrative manipulation and concentrate on James’ nuanced performance as an inchoate young Black man who feels trapped and often hopeless. In support, Sheryl Lee Ralph is impressive as Joanne— especially when she delivers an inspiring speech to Ricardo as he is despairing. ', 'The Virgin of the Quarry Lake\nDirected by Laura Casabé\nWritten by Benjamin Naishtat ', 'The Virgin of the Quarry Lake is an excellent and non-traditional coming of age film about purity corrupted. Director Laura Casabé sets an unusual tone from the start with a vivid slow-motion sequence featuring a homeless man defecating in the street where Natalia (Dolores Oliverio), a sullen teenager, and her superstitious grandmother, Rita (Luisa Merelas) live. Rita believes the block has been cursed—and bad things do start happening; power and water become scarce, and a hit and run that occurs is particularly shocking. But Natalia is focusing all her attention on keeping Silvia (Fernanda Echeverria) away from Diego (Augustin Sosa), the guy she is crushed on. Natalia may be a virgin, but as she loses her inhibitions—snorting cocaine at a club or hiring a sex worker to be deflowered—she becomes empowered. And she is captivating as she confidently slinks her way through this hypnotic film with a mischievous sense of purpose. On a dance floor, Natalia shoots eye daggers at Sylvia that could kill her, and in a fantastical scene, she kisses—and injures—a guy who won’t let her pass on a bridge. Is Natalia imagining and manifesting what she wants, or are these just the flights of fancy from a horny and frustrated teenager? Casabé leaves things deliciously ambiguous. Oliverio is superb conveying so many emotions in her blank expressions that viewers will recalibrate what to think and feel right up to the film’s horrific and highly satisfying climax.

The Best Sundance Films to Look Out for in 2025,https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/g63654770/best-movies-sundance-film-festival-2025/,"['From Alison Brie and Dave Franco’s body horror movie to an award-winning Dylan O’Brien performance.', 'Last week, movie lovers and industry folk descended upon Main Street in Park City, Utah, for another go at the Sundance Film Festival. The consensus among critics and attendees this year? The vibes were a little different. (And not just because the ski town’s main thoroughfare was shut down to become pedestrian-only.) The sales were noticeably slower and more conservative than in past fests, an understandable slump for an industry reeling from L.A.’s wildfires two states away. But there’s still plenty of reason to support independent filmmakers; in fact, if the art form is really as under threat as industry pundits say, that’s all the more reason to invest.', 'With almost 90 films (and more episodic projects) on show this year, Sundance had a lot to offer, and we did our very best to catch as much as we could both on-site in Utah and remotely from home. And still, even with an agenda of three-plus movies a day and several coffees, we missed a few titles—but we were able to enjoy some crowd-pleasers (The Wedding Banquet and Together), documentaries (Seeds) and some Dylan O’Brien (Twinless).', 'Check out our list of top favorites below. Honorable mentions include: the Joel Edgerton- and Felicity Jones-starring Train Dreams (which Netflix acquired), Ira Sachs’s Peter Hujar’s Day, Jennifer Lopez and Tonatiuh’s stellar performances in Kiss of the Spider Woman, and the family road trip film Omaha.', '“Cherien Dabis’s incredible third feature will move you so deeply that you’ll find yourself pacing, trying to process all your emotions. All That’s Left of You follows a Palestinian family across three generations, navigating the enduring trauma of displacement and grief. I feel incredibly lucky to have witnessed the stunning performances of this ensemble cast (including Dabis, Saleh Bakri, Adam Bakri, Mohammad Bakri, Maria Zreik, and Muhammad Abed Elrahman), because nothing else at the festival quite compared. Though the narrative is undeniably tragic, it is portrayed with profound beauty, poetry, and honor to the Palestinian experience. Go see this film when it’s out.”—Christine Jean-Baptiste, contributor', '“Rose Byrne gives an unforgettable performance as a mother teetering on the edge as she tries to care for her sick daughter, repair a mysterious gaping hole in her ceiling that emits light and goo, and keep her professional life afloat. I won’t sugarcoat it; this is a stressful watch—like if Uncut Gems were about motherhood, or if Nightbitch were far more chaotic and abstract—but through the dark comedy, writer and director Mary Bronstein creates a visceral portrayal of being a parent. It’s not just about the overwhelming responsibilities—though you do spiral with Linda (Byrne) as she drives her kid to doctors appointments while her husband is away, or dodges her child’s pleas for a hamster, or searches for a woman who disappeared from her office—it’s also about not knowing if you’re doing it right and lacking the help to figure it out. All while still harboring your own unresolved trauma and generational wounds. I’ve been thinking about it for days now, especially Byrne’s eye-twitches.”—Erica Gonzales, deputy editor, culture', 'Coming in 2025.', '“Lurker is the slow-burn version of what Saltburn tried to do, but better. Sorry! Someone had to say it. Alex Russell’s (The Bear, Beef) thrilling directorial debut follows a wallflower (Théodore Pellerin) whose proximity to fame, after meeting his favorite artist (Archie Madekwe), sends him spiraling. The chemistry between the two leads is so palpable, it’s downright scary. In a nutshell, this film is about fandom gone wrong, a tense dance of power dynamics, and just a really good time. Also, who do I need to call to get Zack Fox in more films?”—CJB', ""“An undercover cop (Tom Blyth) is tasked with seducing, then arresting, gay men. It's business as usual… until he falls in love with one of his suspects. What could possibly go wrong? Carmen Emmi’s directorial debut offers a poignant and heartbreaking glimpse into a man’s internal struggle as the weight of his choices closes in on him. The grainy, lo-fi VHS footage amplifies the haunting nature of the memories that refuse to let go. Plainclothes won the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Ensemble Cast.”—CJB"", '“Brittany Shyne’s debut won this year’s U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Documentary, and it’s easy to see why. Seeds is an intimate portrait of Black famers in the rural South that immerses viewers into their daily lives and work, from harvesting cotton and corn, to repairing their homes by hand, to raising their grandchildren and livestock. Shot beautifully in black and white, the film takes its time to build a connection between the audience and its subjects, mostly elderly men continuing the family tradition of making a living on their land, even if their children have moved away to seek work elsewhere. Most importantly, the film highlights the discrimination they face compared to their white counterparts, especially when it comes to getting support from the Department of Agriculture. In especially moving scenes, they protest in Washington, D.C., and take turns urging federal workers over the phone for immediate aid from the Biden administration. A moving and powerful watch.”—EG', '“Directed by Ahmir ‘Questlove’ Thompson—who won an Oscar for his last Sundance film, Summer of Soul—this documentary examines the lasting legacy of Sly and the Family Stone and its legendary frontman. Laced with compelling archival footage and interviews from fellow stars like Nile Rodgers, André 3000, Chaka Khan, and Stone’s own bandmates, the film traces the musician’s career from his early beginnings as a songwriter to his breakout with 1967’s ‘Dance to the Music’ and activism through music. But through it all, Questlove investigates the notion of the ‘Black genius’ and how it affects people who are given that label: how much harder they have to work than their white peers to gain the same recognition; the scrutiny that comes with fame and success; the pressures of being accepted by their community as they rise to mainstream renown. It’s a smart way to transcend the typical music documentary format, and is equally thought-provoking and entertaining.”—EG', 'On Hulu February 13.', '“Eva Victor stars in, directs, and writes her impressive directorial debut, telling the story of a graduate student-turned-professor grappling with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Victor masterfully controls the film’s tone, balancing humor and vulnerability without it ever feeling starved or forced. The sharp, witty dialogue underscores her protagonist Agnes’s pain with a humility that feels like a warm familiar hug. It’s no surprise that this won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award: U.S. Dramatic. This is just the beginning for Victor, especially since A24 just bought the rights to the film.”—CJB', '“There are superfans, and then there is Charles. A two-time lottery winner (yes, really—the lucky numbers are displayed in his mansion), the eccentric recluse decides to spend part of his prize money reuniting his favorite band ever: McGwyer Mortimer, an English folk duo and former couple (played by Tom Basden and Carey Mulligan) who ruled the early 2010s. The blindly optimistic Charles (Tim Key) invites them separately for an intimate gig on his remote island, Parent Trap-style. The only thing is: Herb McGwyer doesn’t know that Nell Mortimer is coming—with her husband. Charles is the funny yet sentimental heart of the film, cracking often improvised one-liners in every scene (he calls Herb ‘Dame Judy Drenched’ after he’s soaked from the waves) and still delivering gutting emotion. It honestly could’ve used more Carey Mulligan, but isn’t that every movie? The Ballad of Wallis Island is sweet and heartfelt with a John Carney feel, if at times overly saccharine, but it still works.”—EG', 'In theaters March 28.', '“So, here’s the thing: Chris (Bowen Yang) and Min (Han Gi-chan) are in a loving relationship, but Min’s very rich Korean grandparents don’t know he’s gay. Meanwhile, Lee (a fantastic Lily Gladstone) and Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) are ready to become parents, but can’t afford another round of IVF. When Min is at risk of getting sent back home to Korea, he and the friend group devise a plan: He’ll fake-marry Angela so he can stay in the country, his family will continue to think he’s straight, and he can pay for Angela and Lee’s IVF. Sounds like a great plan until his grandmother (Minari’s Youn Yuh-jung) arrives, expecting a real wedding. In a play where everything could go wrong, Andrew Ahn’s new take on Ang Lee’s 1993 comedy feels so right. It’s a tribute to queer community and chosen family that will have you in stitches (Han is a hilarious surprise in his first English-speaking role) and in tears (Tran and Youn will break your heart). Thanks to its heartwarming love stories and fantastic ensemble (which also includes Joan Chen), Ahn was rightfully met with a standing ovation when he took the stage at Eccles Theater.”—EG', 'In theaters April 18.', '“If The Substance were a dark rom-com, maybe this would be it. Alison Brie and Dave Franco co-star and -produce this wild, comedic body horror about a couple who take the next step in their relationship and try not to get under each other’s skin. Millie (Brie) and Tim (Franco) move out of the city and into a house in a woodsy suburb hours away, but something’s off. (Not that things weren’t already awkward; Tim turned down Millie’s proposal in front of all their friends, and her new co-worker seems to be making advances.) While exploring the trails around their home, an accidental detour leads Tim and Millie to be overcome by a dark force that takes over their bodies, interferes with their daily lives, and challenges their relationship. With jump scares, cults, and many references to The Thing, Michael Shanks’s feature debut is outrageous and gross, but downright entertaining—and even darkly romantic. Brie and Franco’s comedic and physical chemistry is on full display, too. If you thought long-term relationships were boring, Together, which was purchased by Neon, will prove otherwise.”—EG', 'In theaters August 1.', '“Dylan O’Brien hive, we are SO back. Twinless follows two men who meet at a twin bereavement support group, but at its core, this film is one big trust fall exercise. Writer-director-actor James Sweeney delivers a sharp comedic voice that doesn’t shy away from the tender, heartfelt moments depicted through a codependent bromance. The narrative unfolds in (fucked up) ways that will have you cackling one minute and crying the next. If you leave feeling gaslit by this film, I think that’s the point. O’Brien is unsparingly great (and hot) in this, but Sweeney is not to be slept on. Twinless won Sundance’s U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Acting (for O’Brien) and the Audience Award: U.S. Dramatic.”—CJB', '“If director-producer Charlie Shackleton had obtained the rights to a certain nonfiction book about a certain serial killer, then he would’ve made the kind of true crime documentaries that have been steadily lining up Netflix, HBO, and Prime Video’s libraries in the past decade. But in the final negotiations, the deal fell through. So, in this inventive documentary, he walks us through what could’ve been—how he framed the story, the ‘emotional B-roll’ he would’ve used, and the actor reenactments he imagined—and skewers the modern true crime doc genre along the way. He calls out the stereotypes in these works, from the moody, overlapping graphics in the title sequences to shots of police tape that, once he points it out, appear to be in almost all of these projects, from Making a Murderer to The Jinx. He also addresses the ethical lines these filmmakers (including himself) toe by documenting and profiting off of someone else’s real-life tragedy and trauma. Does the work really benefit the greater good or just your own ego? Shackleton prods at the system while participating in it, which will make you see the genre in a new light.”—EG', '“Josh O’Connor is Dusty, a cowboy who must begin again after he loses his family ranch—and, with it, his job—in a devastating fire. He and other displaced residents are put up in a trailer park by FEMA as they rebuild their lives, but Dusty distances himself from his neighbors (one of whom is played by True Detective’s Kali Reis) and is slow to accept the help he needs. As he reconnects with his ex-wife, Ruby (Meghann Fahy), and their daughter, Callie-Rose (Lily LaTorre), he opens himself up to his fellow refugees and soon learns that community is necessary for survival. O’Connor delivers a moving performance in a role that challenges the image of the lone cowboy. Max Walker-Silverman (A Love Song) explores what it means to honor your roots and plant new ones. Set amid sweeping shots of Colorado landscape, the film is not afraid to show how climate change affects those who make a living off the land.”—EG', 'Molly Sims Gets Ready for Kinda Pregnant', 'Where’s the Crying in H Mart Movie?', ""What to Know About 'The Last of Us' Season 2"", 'All About the ‘Legally Blonde’ Prequel, ‘Elle’', 'What’s Up With the ‘Severance’ Goats?', 'House of the Dragon Renewed for Season 3', '30 of the Best Romantic Movies', 'The Best Movies to Watch on Valentine’s Day', '‘Severance’ Season 2, Episode 3 Recap', 'A Refresher on Ms. Casey in Severance', ""'Bridgerton' Is Expected to Return in 2026"", ""When Do New Episodes of 'Severance' Drop?"", 'A PART OF HEARST DIGITAL MEDIA', 'WE MAY EARN COMMISSION FROM LINKS ON THIS PAGE, BUT WE ONLY RECOMMEND PRODUCTS WE BACK.', '©2025 HEARST MAGAZINE MEDIA, INC.

Four talking points from Sundance 2025,https://www.screendaily.com/news/four-talking-points-from-sundance-2025/5201490.article,"['BY JEREMY KAY3 FEBRUARY 2025', '', 'SOURCE: SUNDANCE INSTITUTE', 'EUGENE HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR, SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL AND PUBLIC PROGRAMMING, ATOP THE EGYPTIAN THEATRE', 'The penultimate Sundance Film festival to run in Park City ended over the weekend in a flurry of awards. ', 'There was scarcely any on-site activity by way of completed acquisitions, although deals will follow in the weeks and months ahead. And there were genuine discoveries, reflecting the accepted wisdom that Sundance is a complicated beast and is many things to many people.', 'The big talking point is where will the revered soul of independent cinema house itself starting in 2027. The festival hierarchy will reveal all before long. Screen looks at some of the key talking points to emerge from the festival, which ran January 23-February 2.', 'The slowest Sundance market in living memory may be the confluence of unfortunate events (the LA wildfires made it hard to focus; the long-tail impact of the 2023 Hollywood strikes), the continuation of a trend that began during the pandemic (US buyers have become ultra-cautious in an unforgiving distribution landscape and deal-making can play out on Zoom well beyond a festival or market’s end date), or simply timing (there just weren’t that many commercial films ready). Most likely it was a combination of all three, but buyers bemoaned the fact that the selection was, on the whole, sobering and bleak.', 'Michael Shanks’ body horror Together, starring real-life couple Alison Brie and Dave Franco, was the big sale, going to Neon in a worldwide deal believed to be in the $17m range. No other acquisition title came close to being as commercially appealing. Netflix snapped up the Felicity Jones-Joel Edgerton drama Train Dreams, and A24 is closing a deal for Eva Victor’s excellent feature debut Sorry, Baby. Beyond that, deals will eventually close on titles like, among others, Nadia Fall’s Brides, The Thing With Feathers starring Benedict Cumberbatch, and Jimpa with Olivia Colman and John Lithgow – solid films led by strong performances. But who will step up to buy Bill Condon’s Kiss Of The Spider Woman, a story that has gone through multiple iterations in book, film and play form, which is said to have cost between $50m and $60m?', 'Sundance’s new-ish festival director Eugene Hernandez has emphasised the festival’s return to its discovery roots, a theme the hierarchy has repeated since Geoff Gilmore’s tenure when it was common to see the biggest names in Hollywood turn up to support their Park City world premieres of studio films. The good news is Sundance has indeed been bringing back the discoveries and in 2025 there were several that caused a stir for all the right reasons. Anybody who saw Sorry, Baby in particular will know that writer-director-actor Eva Victor is a major talent. Her feature debut blends a deep sense of unease over a shocking event with a touching and darkly humourous character study wrapped in a puzzle.', 'Props must also go to Rashad Frett’s accomplished and sobering feature debut Ricky, starring another standout, Stephan James, as a young man who is released from prison after spending half his life behind bars and struggles to adapt to life on the outside.', 'As usual, Sundance wore its world-class non-fiction credentials on its sleeve and programmed some absolute corkers that should remain in the conversation throughout the year with robust festival lives and perhaps the odd Telluride screening and awards season run. While this season may not emulate last year’s exceptional crop, which has delivered four out of the five current Oscar nominees, there were acclaimed entries. It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley, Seeds, 2000 Meters To Andriivka, Come See Me In The Good Light, André Is An Idiot, and Sly Lives! each packed a punch in different ways.', 'Visitors and locals arguing for and against Sundance in Park City is nothing new, but the debate has intensified since the pandemic and Sundance acted, inviting bids from would-be hosts. Commonly heard refrains: Sundance has outgrown Park City and become too corporate. Prices have soared. The ski community looks down its nose at the festival and hotels don’t like the distraction. Local businesses love Sundance and will miss it. The city and state will miss the income (if the festival leaves Utah). In the coming weeks or months, the festival hierarchy will reveal where Sundance will situate itself starting in 2027.', 'Of the three possible choices, Cincinnati seemed to be the destination on most people’s lips during this year’s festival, and Screen has heard the same. But whether it is in Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado, or a hop down the Utah mountain to Salt Lake City (with Park City taking a back seat), the festival will still need to make some noise to capture attention. That said, it won’t want those activations and corporate takeovers on the main drag to become too noisy or risk upsetting the locals. Boulder is a big college town and has a population of roughly 105,000 according to the 2023 Census – small by the standards of a major city, but much bigger than Park City’s 8,250.

Sundance waves goodbye with stories pitched between fame and obsession,https://www.aol.com/news/sundance-waves-goodbye-stories-pitched-184440880.html,"['', '', 'Park City got a hot blast of star power when Jennifer Lopez arrived Jan. 26 to launch Bill Condon’s blazingly emotional adaptation of the Tony-winning stage musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” Lopez plays dual roles as a movie actor and an arachnoid goddess and she sauntered into the Sundance Film Festival premiere channeling the power of both. Jeans and snow boots? Acceptable attire for mere mortals. Lopez wore a cobweb-and-lace see-through gown and heels. Her weather-defying glamour was so dazzling that everyone in my shuttle the next morning was talking about it — while also being boggled that Lopez’s little-known co-star, the monomonikered Tonatiuh, somehow stole his share of the spotlight.', 'Sundance was created to launch talents like Tonatiuh, a young actor from Los Angeles, who’s fantastic as a prison inmate who papers his cell with posters of Lopez’s fantasy icon. I’d seen his face once before in the background of the Netflix action movie ""Carry-On."" Now, I’ll watch a movie just because he’s in it. This festival is where stars are born, even if it’s gotten harder for an indie film to get financed without at least one recognizable name.', ""That’s always been a little true. If a certain video-store clerk hadn’t gotten his producer's acting teacher's wife to pass a script to Harvey Keitel, “Reservoir Dogs” might not have secured the cash, cast or clout to premiere at Sundance in 1992. How different would today’s Hollywood look if no one had ever seen that dizzying opening scene in which a breakfast table of crooks debates Madonna? How many potential Quentin Tarantinos never met their Keitel?"", 'Fandom is a word more associated with glossy superhero blockbusters, but it was one of the through lines of this year’s festival. Film after film tugged at the fragile balance between object and admirer, the vital symbiosis between artist and audience, the vulnerability of knowing that any towering career — even Lopez’s — could topple over without anyone there to applaud. In “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Tonatiuh functions as both Lopez’s disciple and her defender. When his cynical cellmate (Diego Luna) suggests that Lopez’s character suffers from childhood trauma, Tonatiuh groans, “Ugh, let her be.”', 'I adored “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” That it left Sundance without distribution is a shock. At least director James Griffiths’ “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” a major crowd-pleaser, will be in theaters by the end of the next month. It’s about a socially awkward lottery winner named Charles (Tim Key), a chatterbox with the patter of a Borscht Belt comic, who offers his favorite folk duo nearly $1 million to play a reunion show. (Devotees of the British game show “Taskmaster” will recognize Key from Season 1.) There’s a catch: The gig is on a remote beach for an audience of one. Worse, the bandmates, Herb (Tom Basden) and Nell (Carey Mulligan), are estranged exes. Herb sold out and got famous; Nell quit the business to sell artisanal jam. Neither is able to ignore a briefcase of money dangled by their No. 1 fan.', 'Herb spends most of the movie scowling, as he suspects that Charles wants the duo to reunite on stage and in bed. Eventually, Herb snaps: “You’re like a cut-price Geppetto,” he snarls. Yet, whenever Key’s lonely widower drops his desperation to amuse, there’s years of pain on his face. Key, Basden and Griffiths have been trying to expand their original BAFTA-nominated short, “The One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island,” for 18 years. The feature needed a star of Mulligan’s scale to get made. I’m glad it did.', 'That Geppetto insult was dangling over my head when I sat down for “Lurker,” yet another fraught comedy about artists and fans. An underground musician (Archie Madekwe) risks his own rise to fame when a manipulative Instagram stalker (Théodore Pellerin) hitches his own future to the singer’s ascent. Tense, uncomfortable and choke-on-your-own-anxiety funny, this first feature by Alex Russell, a writer on “Beef” and “The Bear,” was one of most skillful delights of the festival, even if the movie itself seems on the fence about whether it believes in talent or opportunism. At its most on-the-nose, “Lurker” repeatedly plays the same song: the tinkling 1960s R&B ballad “I’m Your Puppet.” But every time you hear it, someone else is yanking the strings.', '“Opus” heightens the stakes by pitting a pop megastar named Moretti (John Malkovich) against a magazine journalist, Ariel (Ayo Edibiri). A debut horror film by the former GQ writer Mark Anthony Green, it had a sprinkling of wit and insight plus a surprising amount of Malkovich sex appeal. Still, it didn’t seize the moment to say much of anything. Does Moretti start knocking off Ariel’s colleagues because they’re too obsequious or not slavish enough? The movie opened strong but came to feel like a tribute band that exists only because they came up with the perfect punny name. (Not you, burger-themed metal band Mac Sabbath — you’re perfect.)', ""Read more:Our 6 favorite films at this year's Sundance"", 'There’s more death and saxophones in Gala del Sol’s “Rains Over Babel,” a mythological fantasia set in a Colombia nightclub that doubles as a portal to heaven (and hell). One track of the plot follows the bar’s owner’s son (Jose Mojica) and a luckless gambler (Celina Biurrun) on a dangerous mission to rescue the town’s most popular jazz-band leader (Jacobo Velez) from a maze of bondage mask-clad Minotaurs. Meanwhile, back on the dance floor, a diva named La Flaca (Saray Rebolledo) has the power to control death itself. One puke-smeared drug overdose victim refuses to accept that this is his last party.', 'It’s a lot of movie, even without the sassy talking lizard or the drag performer (William Hurtado) who disobeys his pastor father by yanking on a light-up afro wig and strutting onstage to slay. The film, a sequined hat on a hat on a hat, can feel a bit overburdened by literary allusions. (There’s a character named Dante.) Still, from costumes to makeup to ambition, the razzle-dazzle is impressive.', 'In Argentine filmmaker Laura Casabé’s “The Virgin of Quarry Lake,” a name-dropper incites violence just being adjacent to celebrity. This glancingly supernatural teen nightmare gets grisly when a social climber named Silvia (Fernanda Echevarría) barges into a small clique and claims to have all sorts of famous friends. Silvia’s braggadocio wins her the attention of a heartthrob named Diego (Agustín Sosa) — and the wrath of local beauty Natalia (Dolores Oliverio), who has always believed that Diego was hers. Imagine “Carrie"" with a spoiled girl.', 'Set in 2001, the movie hangs out in the internet cafes that are just coming into popular use. Yet, there’s already a sense that this new millennium is collapsing. The electricity won’t stay on, the water is permanently off, the bloodstain in front of Natalia’s house gets bigger by the day. If you don’t like gore, I’d close your eyes for the bludgeoning that takes place during the first five minutes. The film ends in a rush, simply dropping the mic and running off. Before it does, however, “Quarry Lake” is confident and gripping.', 'Read more:John Lithgow and Olivia Colman talk about their film’s importance in this time in U.S. history', 'The most mortal tale of hero worship was Sophie Hyde’s semi-autobiographical “Jimpa,” an endearing family drama about an iconic gay-rights activist, Jim (John Lithgow), and his non-binary grandchild Frances (Aud Mason-Hyde), whom he affectionately calls his “grandthing.” Jim lives in Amsterdam; Frances was raised in Australia with their mom, Hannah (Olivia Colman), who was left behind when her dad set out to be his truest self.', ""The film starts with both Frances and Hannah rhapsodizing about Jim from a distance, saying all the things you’re supposed to say about marginalized people who have lived their lives courageously. They leave out that Jim is also selfish, close-minded and flaky: a conversational tyrant who controls the volume of every chat. Frances simply doesn't know him that well. Mason-Hyde, the director’s own child, is a natural performer, while Colman's Hannah has decades of experience suppressing her resentments. Playing a filmmaker based on Hyde herself, she claims it’s possible to make a movie that celebrates her iconic father's life without any conflict."", 'To Hyde’s credit, her script zags away from sentimentality as much as it zigs. Things drag a little in “Jimpa’s” last stretch, but you come away believing that an uplifting sermon is no way to honor your idol. That kind of fanboy speech shuts down difficult questions. Good movies ask them.', 'Sign up for Indie Focus, a weekly newsletter about movies and what’s going on in the wild world of cinema.', 'This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.', '', 'Advertisement']"

Catch the weekly It List here for the latest releases that we can’t wait to watch, stream, listen to, read and binge.', 'This year, 88 films screened at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The titles ranged from A24-produced Opus to Netflix-acquired Train Dreams.', 'The festival ran between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2. I caught about 15 movies on the ground and 25 at home during the festival’s online screening portion. I’m so sad I missed out on The Wedding Banquet and Peter Hujar’s Day, but I trust that they’ll be available to the general public soon.', '', '', 'I assigned superlatives to 11 of the best movies I saw, along with some honorable mentions. Get your watch lists ready — I’ll walk you through them.', 'What to know: Writer-director Eva Victor stars as an academic facing triumphs and setbacks as she moves past something really, really bad that happened to her.', 'Why I recommend it: Knowing as little as you can about this movie and letting its complexities, sadness and wry humor wash over you is the way to go. It’s a smashing debut for Victor, who got their big break posting viral videos on X.', 'How to watch: Sorry, Baby was acquired by A24 at the festival and is “coming soon.”', 'What to know: Twinless is a story about two men who meet and film an unlikely friendship at a support group for people who have lost a twin.', 'Why I recommend it: I interviewed writer-director-star James Sweeney about the film, and he was hesitant to spill many juicy details. He was extremely complimentary about his co-lead, Dylan O’Brien (of Maze Runner movie fame), who plays two characters with immense distinction and heart.', 'How to watch: Plans for distribution have not yet been announced.', 'Honorable mention: In Oh, Hi!, Logan Lerman is no longer the young star of the Percy Jackson movies — he’s the elusive and ever-so-slimy love interest of Molly Gordon’s character, who becomes increasingly unhinged trying to ensure that their vacation is perfectly romantic.', 'What to know: An ensemble cast including Alex Wolff and Chloë Sevigny star in this movie that skewers edgy media companies that mine foreign locales for offbeat stories. Moments of sweetness emerge as well, somehow.', 'Why I recommend it: It felt like Girls mixed with the Vice News YouTube channel, which might be the highest praise a millennial can offer.', 'How to watch: Mubi will be releasing the film in 2025.', 'What to know: It’s an intense premise: Advertising legend André Ricciardi is dying of cancer because he didn’t get a colonoscopy when he should have, and the audience watches that slowly happen.', 'Why I recommend it: I saw many a gut-wrenching documentary at Sundance — that’s often the vibe, I hear — but stay with me. You fall in love with Ricciardi as he dies, and the simple procedure he overlooked becomes a necessity to anyone watching. It’s his final and most powerful ad campaign, as director Tony Benna told me.', 'How to watch: André Is an Idiot was produced by A24, but plans for distribution have not yet been announced.', 'Honorable mention: Sugar Babies follows a young woman who paid her way through college running an online sugar baby business. The documentary shares so much about what it’s like to live in a rural area that offers community where it lacks resources.', 'What to know: This remake of the 1992 musical (which, like the original 1985 movie, is based on the 1976 book) may be its best iteration yet. It stars Tonatiuh as a prisoner recounting stories of his favorite old Hollywood legend (Jennifer Lopez) to his roommate (Diego Luna) to pass the time through wretched conditions.', 'Why I recommend it: On the red carpet, director Bill Condon said he cast Lopez because she’s a true diva, which he means as a sincere compliment. This is her best role yet, and I’ll be running to the theater to rewatch as soon as it’s available.', 'How to watch: Plans for distribution have not yet been announced.', 'What to know: The film follows an American railroad laborer who deals with loss and solitude his whole life. But this is more than a run-of-the-mill bummer of an indie movie — it’s a beautiful, sweeping look at survival and coping with grief after a devastating fire, which is more relevant than ever.', 'Why I recommend it: It was written and directed by the same team behind Sing Sing, one of my favorite movies of 2024. If you can find it in your heart to watch something slow and sad, both of these movies will make you better for it.', 'How to watch: Train Dreams was acquired by Netflix at the festival, but a release date has not yet been announced.', 'Honorable mention: Didn’t Die is a zombie movie about figuring out how to live through constant loss.

Things get weird.', 'Why I recommend it: I saw this one at midnight, where the theater was packed with viewers on the edge of their seats, both for the scares and for Malkovich’s shockingly good musical performances.', 'How to watch: Opus is in theaters March 14.', 'Honorable mention: Touch Me follows two co-dependent roommates as they get addicted to the heroinlike touch of an alien cult leader. I came for the brightly colored aesthetics and stayed for the gory practical effects involving tentacles.', 'What to know: A woman struggles to navigate her child’s mysterious illness and maintain relationships as her house starts falling apart. She does not get one moment of peace and neither does the audience.', 'Why I recommend it: People will tell you that this is Rose Byrne’s best-ever performance, and it is, but don’t miss A$AP Rocky and Conan O’Brien in their incredible supporting roles.', 'How to watch: If I Had Legs I’d Kick You will be distributed by A24, but a release date has not yet been announced.', 'What to know: While a move to the countryside tests the strength of their relationship, a couple (played by Alison Brie and Dave Franco) must also contend with something supernatural drawing them ever closer.', 'Why I recommend it: This movie is delightfully gross.

Danger lurks at every turn despite Ricky’s best intentions. Sheryl Lee Ralph plays against type as his tough parole officer.', 'Why I recommend it: In his introduction at the film’s premiere, writer-director Rashad Frett said he’s lost many loved ones to recidivism. If more people knew how relevant this movie is, the world would be a better place.', 'How to watch: Plans for distribution have not yet been announced.', 'Honorable mention: Jimpa is every bit as sweet as it is gut-wrenching. Olivia Colman and John Lithgow star as a woman trying to relate to (and make a movie about) her dad, a civil rights icon, as he ages but remains wholly himself.', 'What to know: Alia Shawkat stars as an aspiring actress who takes a gig at a military role-playing facility that simulates life in Iraq for soldiers.

Writer-director Hailey Gates told me on the red carpet that this movie is based on a real-life thing.', 'Why I recommend it: You’re as likely to cringe as you are to cry at Sundance, but this movie grasps your emotions with a purpose — to critique war and the ways we interact with it. There’s a reason it won the festival’s top prize!', 'How to watch: Plans for distribution have not yet been announced.', 'Honorable mention: Lurker follows a fan who infiltrates the inner circle of an up-and-coming artist and sheds light on the messiest (and most cringe-inducing) elements of hard-fought online fame.']"
