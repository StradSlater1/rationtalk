StockWatch: Whirlwind Week for Nvidia as Investors Weigh DeepSeek’s Impact,https://www.genengnews.com/topics/artificial-intelligence/stockwatch-whirlwind-week-for-nvidia-as-investors-weigh-deepseeks-impact/,"['AI leader sees positives in Chinese startup, but Wall Street sends shares tumbling 16% and Trump eyes further curbs after meeting CEO Jensen Huang at the White House', 'By Alex Philippidis', ""Nvidia's endeavor building in Santa Clara, CA. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the leading maker of artificial intelligence (AI) graphics processing units (GPUs), met Friday with President Donald Trump, capping a whirlwind week for the increasingly life sciences-focused Silicon Valley microprocessing giant, in which its stock slid 16% as investors assessed how much of a competitive threat the company faces from the Chinese-owned artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek. [Nvidia]"", 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday capped a whirlwind week for the increasingly life sciences-focused Silicon Valley microprocessing giant, in which its stock slid 16% as investors assessed how much of a competitive threat the company faces from the Chinese-owned artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek.', '“We appreciated the opportunity to meet with President Trump and discuss semiconductors and AI policy,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Japan’s NHK and other news outlets. “Jensen and the President discussed the importance of strengthening U.S. technology and AI leadership.”', 'Trump offered few specifics about his meeting with Huang, but said Friday: “He’s the biggest in the world in terms of chips. I can’t say what’s going to happen [except] we had a meeting. It was a good meeting.”', '“Eventually, we’re going to put tariffs on chips” as well as oil and gas, he continued: “That’ll happen fairly soon, I think around the 18th of February.”', 'DeepSeek rattled Wall Street late last month by announcing it had gone live with its open source R1 model, one that it said rivaled the Model o1 of privately held OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. What especially shook investors was the prospect that China may have closed the tech gap with the United States in AI and especially DeepSeek’s claim that it developed an earlier model it launched in December, V3, for just $5.58 million—a far cry from the tens of billions and hundreds of billions of dollars that U.S. AI tech giants have committed toward expanding the technology.', 'However, Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense tech company Anduril Industries and co-founder of virtual reality company Oculus (acquired by Meta predecessor Facebook in 2017), dismissed that cost estimate as CCP [Chinese Communist Party] propaganda, telling Fox Business that much of DeepSeek’s infrastructure costs remain unknown because the company’s widely-quoted cost figure did not include full costs of V3 and R1, whose costs have not been disclosed.', 'At least one analyst agreed that DeepSeek was publicly lowballing its expenses: “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a research note as reported by Dow Jones, contending that the $5.58 million figure “does not include all the other costs associated with prior research and experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data,” though he added that the model was designed “to significantly reduce the cost to train and run, given that only a portion of the parameter set is active at any one time.”', 'V3 is a 671-billion parameter, reinforcement learning-based general-purpose large language model with an emphasis on scale and efficiency, with key strengths that include excelling in problem-solving, mathematics, and logical reasoning, according to the Indian tech education platform GeeksforGeeks. R1, by contrast, is an advanced AI model designed for high-speed processing, logical thinking, self-verification, and accurate content generation across various applications, with applications that include 3ducational tools, research applications, and AI-driven reasoning tasks.', '“The main difference lies in their processing capabilities,” GeeksforGeeks contributor Shubham Kumar explained. “DeepSeek R1 is designed for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for tasks that require quick responses like content creation and coding, while DeepSeek V3 excels in complex reasoning, handling multi-domain tasks, and offering a deeper understanding of language and context.”', 'Trump and several U.S. tech giants late last month sought to reinforce U.S. leadership in AI when they announced the up-to-$500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure joint venture—an effort promoted in part on its ability to help achieve the long-sought goal of developing a cancer vaccine.', 'Investors quickly interpreted DeepSeek’s success as posing a competitive threat to Nvidia since it is the leading maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) and other hardware used in AI. That fear sent Nvidia’s shares tumbling 17% on January 27, from $142.62 to $118.42. The drop wiped out about $600 billion in Nvidia’s market capitalization (the product of the share price and the number of outstanding shares), the largest ever one-day market-cap decline for a public company, briefly bringing the company back under $3 trillion in market cap.', 'Shares recovered Tuesday, bouncing back 9% to $128.99, and restoring the $3 trillion market cap. But on Wednesday, Nvidia shares resumed their slide, falling 4% to $123.70 after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration was considering further curbs on exports of the company’s GPUs to Chinese companies, citing unnamed sources.', 'Starting in 2022, the administration of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden began restricting the export to China of advanced AI GPUs, among chips deemed critical because of their potential military use.', 'Days before leaving office, Biden drew criticism from Nvidia and the Semiconductor Industry Association for further restrictions set to take effect May 15 unless Trump’s administration changes or withdraws them. Those rules would go beyond a 2023 expansion of the limits from Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs to its A800 and H800 GPUs—reduced capability versions of the original 100 series chips initially created for export to China.', 'The restrictions prevented DeepSeek from using Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs, which are now the Blackwell GPUs launched last year, instead relegating the Chinese company to using Nvidia GPUs not covered by the original ban.', 'While DeepSeek said it trained R1 using 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, several market watchers said that claim could not be verified, reasoning that the company may have more GPUs and even more advanced chips than it has disclosed.', 'Bloomberg reported Friday, citing unnamed sources, that the White House and FBI were investigating whether DeepSeek acquired the H800s from third parties in Singapore to get around the Chinese export ban.', '“The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we should be laser-focused on competing to win because we have the best scientists in the world. The Chinese leadership told me that,” Trump said on January 27, addressing the House Republican Issues Conference in Miami.', '“It could be a positive development. Instead of spending billions, you will spend less, and hopefully come up with the same solution,” Trump added. “We are going to unleash our tech companies and dominate the future like never before.”', 'DeepSeek’s impact on AI technology “all depends on the veracity of DeepSeek’s claims,” William Stein, managing director/senior analyst-technology with Truist Securities, wrote in a research note on January 27, as reported by Investors Business Daily. “We cannot determine the veracity of DeepSeek’s claims. If they’re true, it magnifies the already-known risk of an AI spending slowdown.”', 'Whatever the number and type, DeepSeek’s use of Nvidia GPUs may explain why Nvidia has rejected arguments that its dominance of AI hardware is threatened by the competitive challenge posed by DeepSeek-R1.', '“DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” Nvidia stated, using the industry term for the practice of AI models performing multiple inference passes over a query, conducting chain-of-thought, consensus, and search methods to generate the best answer, rather than offer a single direct, pre-trained response. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.”', '“Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking,” the company noted.', 'On Thursday, Nvidia said it was making DeepSeek R1 available as an NVIDIA NIM or “NVIDIA Inference Microservice.” NIMs are optimized cloud-native “microservices” designed to let developers accelerate deployment of generative AI models anywhere—whether through local workstations, on-premises data centers, cloud services, or GPU-accelerated workstations.', 'Pat Gelsinger, who in December announced his retirement as Intel’s CEO—reportedly under pressure from board members dissatisfied with the company’s inability to compete with Nvidia—commented on LinkedIn that DeepSeek succeeded by following three lessons of computing industry success:', '“The market reaction is wrong, lowering the cost of AI will expand the market. Today I’m an Nvidia and AI stock buyer and happy to benefit from lower prices,” wrote Gelsinger, who told TechCrunch his startup Gloo, a messaging platform for churches, will use DeepSeek rather than OpenAI technology. “DeepSeek is an incredible piece of engineering that will usher in greater adoption of AI. It will help reset the industry in its view of open innovation. It took a highly constrained team from China to remind us all of these fundamental lessons of computing history.”', 'Morningstar senior equity analyst Dan Romanoff observed January 27 in a commentary that DeepSeek’s “materially lower” training costs “raised investor concerns about the necessity of the billions of dollars in capital expenditures that large U.S. tech companies have made (and the billions more they plan to spend) on generative AI.”', 'Romanoff’s colleague Brian Colello, an equity strategist with Morningstar, opined in the same commentary he didn’t foresee a halt to the buildout of AI systems now in progress: “Despite DeepSeek’s promise, we doubt the leading cloud vendors and AI builders will pause their plans, although it’s a risk that certainly bears watching.”', '“We believe AI GPU demand still exceeds supply, so while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips,” Colello added, “we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this AI ‘gold rush’.”', '', 'Copyright © 2025 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

The NASDAQ Composite index peaked at 5,048.62 points. That doesn’t sound like much today, but it was up 800% from 1995. Then people started to get nervous about the true value of the dot.com businesses driving the market, interest rates started to rise, and by October 2002, the NASDAQ had fallen 78% from its peak. ', 'We’re not even a month into 2025, and the new Chinese AI program DeepSeek this week sparked Nvidia’s $465 billion rout, the biggest single-day drop in US stock market history. ', 'This is just the beginning. It’s not that DeepSeek is so much better than ChatGPT’s OpenAI or any of the other popular generative AI (genAI) tools. Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. (Just don’t ask it about what happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989.) ', 'No, what matters is that DeepSeek requires an order-of-magnitude less computing power to achieve similar results. By programmer Simon Willison’s count, “DeepSeek v3 trained on 2,788,000 H800 GPU hours at an estimated cost of $5,576,000. For comparison, Meta AI’s Llama 3.1 405B (fewer than DeepSeek v3’s 685B parameters) trained on 11x that; it required more than 30.8 million GPU hours and was trained on 15 trillion tokens of data.', 'What does all that mean? As Larry Dignan, editor-in-chief of Constellation Insights, explained, “You can get API access to DeepSeek’s R1 model for 14 cents for a million tokens compared to OpenAI’s $7.50.” ', 'In other words, “large language models (LLM) pricing is going to collapse.', '“The scary part is the LLM giants didn’t have profit margins to begin with,” he continued. “LLMs are going to commodity in a hurry.” That’s bad news for companies such as OpenAI. Sure, the company’s market value stands at $157 billion — but it’s still losing billions of dollars. If OpenAI’s customers decide they don’t want to pay its rates when they can get much the same service for a fraction of the cost from DeepSeek, where does that leave OpenAI?', 'What happens then? Look at it this way: today’s overheated stock market is driven by the Magnificent Seven— companies that with one exception (Tesla) have one thing in  common: they’re all heavily invested in AI hype. Even Tesla is heavily invested in what Elon Musk calls real-world AI.

It’s not just people like me for whom search is part of what they do for a living; businesses are also turning to Perplexity from Google.', 'Bratin Saha, DigitalOcean’s chief product and technology officer, sees the potential for a relatively small company to become a big player. “DeepSeek AI is the ‘Android moment for AI’ (given that ChatGPT was likened to the ‘iPhone moment for AI’), as it shows groundbreaking AI products from the open-source community,” Saha told me.', '“DeepSeek AI democratizes AI and cloud computing because it shows you do not need multi-billion dollar investments for compelling innovation,” he said. “It lowers the barrier for small and medium enterprises and individual developers to work with AI.” ', 'Exactly. ', 'The way Stephen O’Grady, co-founder and industry analyst with RedMonk, sees it, enterprises have two major AI concerns. How trustworthy the technology is and its cost. As O’Grady points out, “Enterprises have been shocked, in many cases, at the unexpected costs – and unclear returns – from some scale investments in AI.”', 'He’s got that right. O’Grady continued, noting that DeepSeek challenges some core assumptions by enterprises. These are: ', 'This changes everything for businesses that want to use AI and multi-billion dollar companies that want to sell AI to you.

There were no massive algorithmic breakthroughs, just very clever engineering.”', 'DeepSeek, he noted, uses open-source software. Yes, technically, part of it isn’t open source, but one of DeepSeek’s models is under the MIT License. As Stefano Maffulli, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) executive director, pointed out, DeekSeek’s models also fail to be open.', 'Still,”a small team in China took a fresh look at a problem and came up with a novel approach that reduced the cost of chain-of-thought reasoning by 50x (if DeepSeek’s postings are accurate) and then published a paper fully describing their process, allowing the community to benefit from their learnings,” Zemlin said. “We need MORE of this progress, not less.… This is a struggle over open markets between the forces of open and the forces of closed.”  ', 'That may be good for open source and for AI, but for our stock market, which is largely driven by AI, it’s another matter. The Magnificent Seven accounted for over 50% of the S&P 500’s gains in 2024. If they collapse, a good chunk of the market will follow.', 'I’m not normally a bear, but I’ve seen this rodeo before. Oh, AI will survive, and eventually, it will prove useful and profitable. But, in the meantime, I can see an AI crash coming, and it won’t be pretty. ', 'Steven J.

While some of the results had been preannounced, the 31% year-on-year drop in revenues was stunning as the impact of the machinists strike was felt across the company. Overall revenues were 7% below the consensus forecast and the core loss per share of $5.90 was far worse than the street’s estimate for a loss of $3.07.', 'Q4 revenues were the lowest for Boeing since the start of 2022, and inventories reached a bloated $8.67bn, the highest since mid-2020. The company burned through $4bn in free cash flow, in line with what the company had previously indicated. Looking back on the quarter, this was one of the most difficult periods for Boeing both operationally and financially.', 'However, there are a few bright spots and Boeing could have a better year in 2025, he said.', 'In the Commercial Airplanes segment, backlog increased sequentially in both value and the number of aircraft ordered from customers. The decline that began with the Alaska Air incident last January has been stopped for the time being as the company received orders for more than 200 planes in Q4. In addition, Boeing delivered 15 of their widebody 787’s, the highest quarterly result of 2024.', 'While Global Services historically has been the smallest revenue segment for Boeing, the business line generated more revenue than defence in Q4 and achieved its highest operating margin on record at 19.5%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year.', 'Finally, and maybe most importantly, Boeing repaired its balance sheet, buying the company time to sort out its operations in 2025. After raising capital, the company’s cash and marketable securities stood at $26.3bn, the highest level since the onset of the pandemic.', 'Third Bridge experts see plenty of challenges ahead for Boeing in its own manufacturing processes as well as in its supply chain that will have to be addressed in 2025 and beyond. A reset on airplane delivery expectations is in order to something more reasonable. Investors will be looking for more guidance on this issue as well as any additional cost savings that can be achieved as deliveries recover.', 'House prices in the US rose modestly again in November, suggesting a subdued market.', 'Property values rose by 0.4% from October, leaving the annual growth rate unchanged at 4.3%, according to the Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic 20-city Case-Shiller index.', '“This is a far cry from the 6%-7% annual growth rates posted early last year, as a rebound in mortgage rates and growing supply weighed on house price growth in the second half of the year,” said Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics.', 'The modest rise in house prices in November adds to the sense that the housing market is experiencing a bit of a slowdown amid weak buyer demand and gradually rising supply. We think this trend has a bit further to run, before a pickup in homebuying activity should provide some small stimulus around the springtime.', 'The slowdown in homebuying activity towards the end of last year suggests that house price growth should continue to cool until early 2025. Beyond this, a small recovery in buyer demand should offset growing resale supply, providing some impetus to house price growth. However, with limited scope for mortgage rates to fall this year, any recovery is likely to be limited. We are therefore forecasting a modest 4% rise in house prices this year and next.', 'Orders for durable goods in the United States have fallen unexpectedly.', 'Orders for manufactured goods fell by 2.2% in December, against expectations of a 0.6% rise, while November’s decline was revised lower to 2% from 1.2%, according to the Census Bureau.', 'New orders fell by 2.4% excluding defence, and increased by 0.3% excluding transportation.', '🇺🇸 US Durable Goods: Durable goods 1σ Miss, Ex-trans In-line, Nondef & ex-air Beat, Shipments 3σ Beat\n\nMarket moves: $EURUSD up 1 pips to 1.0429, US 2y yield ~unch\n\n*US DURABLE GOODS NEW ORDERS: -2.2 (Est. 0.6, 1σ miss) vs. -1.2 last.

This ongoing action short of a strike could cause delays across the industry to things like fleet refits, the introduction of new models, licensing of new hanger facilities, the union said.', 'The CAA imposed a pay offer worth 3%-4% on staff after “going through the motions of negotiating – an offer which neither kept pace with the industry nor civil service,” Prospect said.

Someone who has owned Nvidia shares since before summer last year should still be sitting on decent gains, even after yesterday’s pullback.', 'The DeepSeek shock has reminded investors they cannot be complacent when trying to play the AI trend. Stocks do not travel in unison and neither do they always travel upwards. Sometimes it’s good to be reminded of this. Valuations have been getting lofty in the tech space and investors need to appreciate that richly priced stocks can fall hard on the slightest bit of bad news.', 'The FTSE 100 continued to be an island of calm, pushing ahead as investors lapped up its plethora of defensive stocks. Utilities and healthcare were in demand, implying that investors were keen to ensure portfolios had some support in case of another tech-related wobble.', 'Yields on government bonds rose slightly, following yesterday’s declines, as investors await the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policy meetings.

Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.', 'The company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free, while DeepSeek’s models are also cheaper to operate than OpenAI’s o1.', 'In an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone”. Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years.', 'The DeepSeek development raises doubts over the necessity for hefty investment in AI infrastructure such as chips and the market-leading role of US tech companies in AI, which in turn threatens to put American tech sector valuations under pressure.', 'DeepSeek claims R1 cost $5.6m to develop, compared with much higher estimates for western-developed models, although experts have cautioned that may be an underestimate. Last year Dario Amodei, the co-founder of leading AI firm Anthropic, put the current cost of training advanced models at between $100m and $1bn.', 'Analysts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised the alarm over AI spending last year by publishing a note in June with the title “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?”', 'It asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”, voicing concerns about a return on spending that may have been crystalised by DeepSeek.', 'Turning to the FTSE 100 index in London, Joshua Mahony at Scope Markets said:', 'The FTSE 100 continues to sail through choppy water with relative ease, as European traders enjoy a brief period of outperformance built around the general lack of big tech companies this side of the Atlantic. The questions that have emerged around a handful of huge AI-focused US tech companies provide the basis for a massive value recalibration if the DeepSeek news can be taken at face value. However, the FTSE 100 instead finds itself on the rise, with the pessimism over lost earnings for the likes of Nvidia instead standing to benefit global businesses where the financial barrier to entry for those seeking to use AI is lower. Chinese stocks continue to rise as people seek the weigh up the validity of the valuation disparity compared with US in a world where AI isn’t just a US-centric affair.', 'Energy markets are attempting to claw back losses after yesterday’s slump, as markets continue to weigh up the potential implications of a world under Trump. The prospect of a prolonged halt to the conflict between Isreal and Hamas opens the door to a return to the key shipping route through the Red Sea, driving down transit times as ships avoid the lengthy route around the Cape of Good Hope. Nonetheless, risks remain over the potential breakdown in relations between the US and Canada, as Trump’s irritation over the trade deficit between the two countries ignores the fact that without energy they would actually have a surplus. Therefore, Trump’s desire to utilise tariffs in a bid to pressurise the Canadians could instead damage their supply of oil & gas, which could prove inflationary.', 'US stock market futures point to a higher open on Wall Street later, with Nvidia – battered yesterday by China’s AI push – rising by 5% in pre-market trading, while other technology stocks have also bounced back.', 'The popularity of China’s DeepSeek’s new AI app led to a rout in US markets yesterday. AI chip leader Nvidia plunged by 17%, wiping nearly $600bn off the company’s market value, the biggest daily loss for any company. The shares are 5.1% higher in pre-market trading, while other AI-linked stocks have also recovered some ground, with Oracle up 3.3% (down nearly 14% yesterday) and Broadcom rising 4.1%, after losing 17.4% yesterday.', 'The Nasdaq is expected to open about 0.6% higher while the broader S&P 500 is set to rise by 0.3% at the open.', 'The “Magnificent 7” members Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta, Apple and Tesla are all due to report corporate results in the next couple of days.', 'Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said:', 'Looking ahead, all eyes will remain firmly planted on the US tech names, following a session that saw Nvidia lose a record $589bn of its market capitalisation. That decline also pushed Nvidia into the third spot behind Apple and Microsoft after just four days of being heralded as the world’s most valuable company.', 'The timing of this week’s news will not be lost on many in the markets, with four of the Mag7 names reporting over the course of Wednesday and Thursday. Undoubtedly, we will see many adjust their statements to shed light on how new developments could drastically reduce capital expenditure going forward. However, it is important to weigh up the possibility that Nvidia chips remain a key component of the DeepSeek repertoire, and thus the idea that all development can be done on a shoestring budget remains unproven for the time being.', 'Halfords shares jumped as much as 20% after the UK bike and car products retailer reported robust holiday sales and upgraded its profit outlook.', 'Halfords said Christmas gifting contributed to 13.1% like-for-like sales growth in its cycling division in December, while colder weather in recent weeks had helped its motoring products with like-for-like sales growth of 5.5% in January.', 'The 133-year-old retailer said:', 'In recent months we have seen an improvement in trading alongside continued progress on a number of key initiatives, including our pricing and promotion strategies and cost reduction measures.', 'Halfords said it is on track to exceed its target of £30m in annual cost savings, and as a result expects to make an underlying pre-tax profit of £32-37m for the year to the end of March. Analysts, on average, are expecting a profit of £28.3m.', 'However, the company, whose stores sell bicycles, accessories and car parts, and which also has garages, mobile vans and home delivery services, warned that changes to Britain’s minimum wage and national insurance contributions would add direct labour costs of £23m for the year to March 2026.', 'It said:', 'While the impact of changes to the minimum wage and national insurance contributions are relatively easy to quantify ... their effects on the demand environment and health of the broader economy are harder to predict.', 'Halfords was founded as a wholesale ironmonger by Frederick Rushbrooke in Birmingham in 1892 (the company takes its name from Halford Street, where Rushbrooke opened a store in 1902 and started selling cycling goods)', 'House sales in London are at the highest level since the Brexit vote dented buyer confidence, as the property market in the capital bounces back from almost a decade of setbacks, according to Foxtons.', 'The London-focused estate agency said it was handling the highest number of homes under offer since before the Brexit vote in 2016, as it reported that revenues and profits for 2024 beat market expectations.', 'Guy Gittins, who started his career at Foxtons in 2002 and returned as chief executive three years ago, said the London house sales market had been “riding high” until the Brexit vote, which hit consumer confidence.', '“Once the Brexit vote was announced the number of sales each year, certainly focused on London, started to diminish,” he said.', 'He said a string of events since then have continued to keep London sales at lower levels, including changes of government, the pandemic and Liz Truss’s mini-budget which fuelled a rise in mortgage rates, affecting buyer affordability.', 'The sales market has had a very tough time of it since the Brexit vote. 2023 was almost a record low level and last year was still historically quite low.', 'First-quarter 2025 revenue growth in sales … reflects strong under-offer activity in the fourth quarter.', 'Amazon is seeking permission to launch drones from its warehouse in Darlington, County Durham, in the latest step towards using the devices to deliver packages to homes.', 'The technology company is to hold a public meeting with local people next week as it seeks permission from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to use the airspace around its warehouse on the edge of the town, in the north-east of England.', 'Amazon plans to hire a team to launch same-day drone deliveries, under a service called Prime Air, once it has secured approval from the local council to take off and land at the site.', 'Customers within 7.5 miles of the warehouse, excluding certain areas not suitable for drones, will be able to opt to use the service or more traditional delivery methods once it launches.']"

Does DeepSeek's Breakthrough Help or Hurt Nvidia Stock? 3 Views You Should Know.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/03/does-deepseeks-breakthrough-help-or-hurt-nvidia-st/,"['', '', '', 'KEY POINTS', ""Perhaps no stock was more profoundly affected by the news from DeepSeek than Nvidia (NVDA 1.71%). In a sense, DeepSeek validated its dominance by announcing its H800 accelerators trained its model for less than $6 million. That cost is a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars OpenAI has spent on ChatGPT's development cost."", 'However, the news calls into question the demand for Nvidia accelerators. Lower-cost AI will likely increase demand for the technology, which may help Nvidia.', 'Still, if entities can build AI models on less expensive technologies, they will presumably have less need to pay premium prices for its top-of-the-line AI chips.', 'Knowing that, investors may wonder how best to invest in Nvidia stock going forward. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors will share their opinions on Nvidia and what investors should do next.', ""Jake Lerch: When it comes to my opinion on Nvidia, I'm unmoved by the recent DeepSeek AI announcement."", ""First of all, I'm taking the news with a healthy spoonful of skepticism. Granted, some AI experts have praised the open-source code that has been released, noting it is an impressive and significant breakthrough."", 'However, questions remain about which -- and how many -- Nvidia GPUs were used to train this new model. But bear in mind that the U.S. government has placed export restrictions on Nvidia GPUs, specifically to prevent Chinese interests from gaining access to them.', ""In other words, don't hold your breath waiting for full transparency on how DeepSeek was built -- and for what purpose."", ""In any event, Nvidia's position as the leading horse in the race to design the best AI chips remains intact. Moreover, the next step in the AI revolution isn't about who will build the next great large language model (LLM)."", 'Instead, investors should remain focused on the bigger picture: AI-powered tools and applications are poised to deliver real-world productivity gains across the economy. Logistics, healthcare, finance, and every other sector will likely generate more sales and more profits as the AI revolution rolls on.', ""Moreover, this breakthrough, such as it is, will not alleviate the need for better and faster chips. After all, if the technological revolution of the last four decades has taught us anything, it's that no one wants to be stuck with outdated technology. People, companies, and governments are always eager to pay up for newer and faster computational power."", ""Remember: The world wasn't satisfied with dial-up internet, and we won't be satisfied with Nvidia A100s, either. The company will continue to innovate with improved chips like its latest, the Blackwell. And it is my belief that those chips will deliver innovations that will outshine DeepSeek."", ""Justin Pope: It's been quite a stressful week for Nvidia shareholders. The stock plunged by double digits after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, recently sent Wall Street scrambling. DeepSeek claims its AI models deliver similar performance to OpenAI's while being open-source (freely available to developers) and costing significantly less to train and operate."", ""More specifically, DeepSeek claims it trained its V3 (chat) AI model using a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, which cost approximately $5.5 million. This would be a remarkable achievement considering the tens of millions of dollars AI companies, like OpenAI and Google (owned by Alphabet), have spent on Nvidia's superior H100 chips. The company credits software engineering for the accomplishment, leaning toward efficiency rather than hardware to deliver the performance it needs."", ""The fear is that Nvidia's GPU sales could cool off as other companies replicate DeepSeek's techniques. Nvidia depends on a small handful of AI hyperscalers for a considerable chunk of its revenue."", ""Multiple industry experts are highly skeptical of the $5.5 million training costs. While Nvidia has claimed that DeepSeek operated within the parameters of chip export restrictions, some question whether the figure excludes additional costs or whether the model was genuinely developed from scratch. That said, DeepSeek's breakthroughs in efficiency seem more plausible. Because its model is open-source, anyone can see how the company did it, and can also run tests. Plus, DeepSeek is severely undercutting OpenAI's pricing. Its R1 (reasoning) model's API outputs cost just $2.19 per 1 million tokens versus $60 for ChatGPT's o1."", ""The bottom line for Nvidia is that it's probably too early to react. Technology companies like Microsoft still can't support their AI demand, so it's unlikely that these massive AI investments will drop off overnight. Business should remain strong for Nvidia. However, over time, a push for cost efficiency could dent GPU demand if efficiency through software engineering can help lengthen the lifespan of existing AI chips."", ""That arguably makes Nvidia a riskier stock moving forward than a few weeks ago. It's still one of the best AI stocks one can buy, but to minimize risk, consider dollar-cost averaging and diversifying your portfolio."", 'Will Healy: The challenge to investing in Nvidia after the DeepSeek news comes down to one attribute: competitive advantage.', ""Nvidia's financials and stock have been on fire since the spring of 2023 when OpenAI revealed that Nvidia AI accelerators powered GPT-4. None of Nvidia's competitors had offered an alternative at that time. Nvidia's accelerators and corresponding CUDA software remain far ahead of competitive offerings."", ""Indeed, demand for the most advanced accelerators is unlikely to disappear, and it is possible Nvidia's competitive advantage will remain intact once analysts dig into the details of DeepSeek's breakthrough. Additionally, DeepSeek did not leave the Nvidia universe to train its models, which bodes well for the company."", 'However, high demand has taken the prices of its state-of-the-art H200 accelerators above $30,000. Should demand at the top end fall, it could force Nvidia to cut the price of this technology.', 'This is concerning since the data center segment, which designs the accelerators, was 87% of company revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Also, the $91 billion in revenue during that time frame rose 135% year over year.', ""Nonetheless, if this latest development reduces its pricing power, that could mean significantly lower revenue per unit, which would presumably slow or possibly reverse Nvidia's revenue growth."", ""Moreover, valuations show Nvidia stock may have a long way to fall. Many investors may overlook this issue since a 47 P/E ratio is arguably low for a fast-growing stock. Unfortunately, the price-to-book ratio of 46 is far above AMD's book value multiple of 3. Investors would likely question that book value multiple in an environment of slowing revenue growth."", ""Furthermore, Nvidia has fallen by more than 50% twice since 2018, a reminder that Nvidia's momentum can turn quickly to the negative."", '', 'NVDA DATA BY YCHARTS', ""It is premature to assume DeepSeek's breakthrough will bring another such decline in the stock price, and even if it does, Nvidia is unlikely to lose its overall competitive advantage. Still, with considerable downside possible, now may not be a good time to hold a disproportionately large position in Nvidia stock."", ""Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Nvidia’s Stock Crash Solves a Wall Street Puzzle,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-28/nvidia-s-deepseek-stock-crash-solves-a-wall-street-puzzle,"['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Why have investors been handed outsized returns for holding the most-profitable US companies? ', 'Counting risk.', 'Photographer: Bryan R. Smith/AFP', 'Listen', '5:08', 'DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has developed a model that can apparently answer questions as well as any chatbot in the US. It might even help answer a long-running question on Wall Street without being asked.', 'For many years, so-called quality stocks in the US, which are essentially shares of the most highly profitable companies, have been among the best performing investments. The MSCI USA Quality Index has returned an enviable 15% a year since 2015, including dividends, nearly 2 percentage points a year better than the S&P 500 Index.', 'Technology giants such as Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., recently catapulted by AI’s promise, have been a big part of quality’s success. And here lies the question: In a mostly efficient market like that of the US, where risk and return are supposed to be closely related, why should investors earn above market returns for owning the most stable, dominant and profitable companies?', 'Monday’s tech rout in which about $590 billion was erased from Nvidia’s market capitalization has brought this question back to the fore.', 'It’s true that higher profitability translates into a higher payoff for investors, all things equal, but investors usually pay a premium to own more profitable companies. I’ve included in my analysis the Russell 1000 Growth Index as a stand-in for quality in parts because there’s significant overlap between the two, particularly at the top. Both include tech heavyweights Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., though growth has a higher weighting toward them at 43% than quality’s 26%. Growth, however, offers a longer history and a useful contrast with value, whereas there isn’t a ready-made basket of stocks that represents the other side of quality.', 'The growth index is expected to achieve a return on equity of 34% this year, but at a price of 34 times forward earnings. The quality index offers only a slightly better tradeoff, with an expected ROE of 32% in exchange for 28 times earnings. Compare that with the Russell 1000 Value Index, which is expected to produce an ROE of just 12% but can be had for nearly half the earnings multiple.', 'As those numbers show, after accounting for both profitability and valuation, investors mostly get what they pay for, so it’s not entirely clear which basket of stocks is the best bet. Yet in the tech-fueled era, the quality index has beaten the S&P 500 by 2 percentage points a year since 1994 through December, the longest period for which its performance is available, and every time over rolling 10-year periods.', 'It may seem as if quality is a sure winner, but the emergence of DeepSeek, and its obvious potential disruption of US tech giants, suggests otherwise. It hints that quality investors are paid to take more risk, much the way stock investors are paid a premium relative to safe bonds or bond investors relative to stable cash. In both cases, investors are compensated for incremental risk.', 'The naked problem with abnormally high profits is that they’re not sustainable — most people wouldn’t recognize the names of the most profitable companies from 50 or 100 years ago. There are many pitfalls awaiting fat profits, and here are two: They tend to attract regulators, as Microsoft learned in the 1990s and Alphabet has experienced more recently. DeepSeek highlights a second, and potentially more lethal one, which is that high profits — or the potential for it from innovations such as AI — attract competitors eager to take market share.', 'The risk lies in not knowing when the party will end, which makes it difficult to get out in time. Once disruption is evident, stocks can reprice quickly to reflect the expected loss of profits well into the future. That’s particularly true for high-valuation companies such as Nvidia where much of the price is dependent on rosy future growth. The declines can be sudden and steep.', 'When the dust settled on Monday, the growth index was down about 3%. Quality was down, too, although not as much because it’s not as concentrated in the big AI names. Those are not drastic moves, but they show a market wrestling with the impact DeepSeek will have on the US’s biggest, most profitable companies that have loudly hung their future prosperity on AI.', 'If the losses among tech stocks continue, some perspective will help. Since 1995, growth’s forward price-earnings ratio has been about 46% higher than value’s on average. Even after the DeepSeek selloff on Monday, growth trades at a 72% premium to value, well higher than the historical average and comparable to the premium just before the tech selloff in 2022. When disruptions get serious, growth has even been known to trade at a discount to value, as it did during the 2008 financial crisis.', 'So, it’s too soon to say if DeepSeek will dethrone Big Tech. But it’s a good time to be reminded that the outsized returns investors have enjoyed from quality stocks are probably not a free lunch, even if the risk is hard to see and even harder to anticipate.', 'More From Bloomberg Opinion:', 'Want more Bloomberg Opinion?

And while I understand the desire to reduce potential losses, allowing emotions to dictate your investing decisions is rarely a good idea, especially when it's based on a perceived problem rather than a real and tangible one."", 'Such is the case with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) right now. For the last two years, Nvidia has been one of the top-performing stocks in the entire market -- thanks in large part to its critical role in the artificial intelligence (AI) movement.', 'But on 27 January, shares of Nvidia cratered by 16% -- wiping out roughly $500 billion of market capitalisation from the company.', ""Did everything just change for Nvidia, or is this sell-off emotional?

So wouldn't that be good news for Nvidia?"", ""Well, the answer is a bit nuanced. While it could be perceived as a good thing that yet another cutting-edge AI application leverages Nvidia's hardware, the A100 and H800 are old GPUs not widely used by tech companies anymore."", ""Over the last few years, you may have heard management teams from Meta Platforms, Tesla, and many others specifically reference purchasing Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell architecture. These are Nvidia's newest and most expensive GPU products."", ""But if DeepSeek really has built something as powerful as ChatGPT using cheaper, less sophisticated infrastructure, tech companies may decide they don't need to shell out for Nvidia's latest and greatest. That's the idea that has sent investors into a full-fledged panic."", 'Dan Ives leads technology research at Wedbush Securities and has long been an Nvidia bull. Despite the news out of DeepSeek, Ives remains incredibly optimistic about Nvidia\'s future and just called the sell-off a ""golden"" opportunity to buy the dip.', 'No US Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.

So, demand for Nvidia's GPUs was likely to begin decelerating anyway."", ""On top of that, Nvidia has many businesses apart from its data center operation. For example, the company is a leader in gaming and is playing a huge role in the development of self-driving car software. In other words, Nvidia's future doesn't revolve around a single development. Nvidia's products power myriad AI services and the company's use cases remain broad."", ""Could DeepSeek lead to a slowdown for Nvidia's business? We don't know, but its GPU business was probably headed for a slowdown anyway."", ""Regardless, I still see the company supporting the broader AI movement for years to come. Nvidia's Blackwell architecture is rumored to be sold out for the next year, and its successor product, Rubin, could be launching as soon as this year.

DeepSeek Doesn’t Damage Case for Magnificent Seven Stocks,https://www.etftrends.com/etf-education-channel/deepseek-doesnt-damage-case-magnificent-seven-stocks/,"['With Nvidia (NVDA) the most greatly impacted, the Magnificent Seven stocks were recently slammed. That’s because news broke that China AI company DeepSeek has made significant progress in AI. And it did so at a fraction of the cost domestic firms typically incur.', 'Unnerving investors all the more was news that DeepSeek made those strides using antiquated semiconductors that are far cheaper than AI chips sold by Nvidia. Concerning headlines to be sure. And they weighed on ETFs  like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM). Fortunately, the DeepSeek dip was brief and QQQ and QQQM subsequently bounced back.', 'Those rebounds could prove credible. That’s because professional investors believe the DeepSeek news isn’t as damaging to the Magnificent Seven stocks as previously believed. In fact, many professional money managers believe it will be domestic policy, not DeepSeek, that charts the near-term course for the Mag 7. That could be a relief to investors holding QQQ and QQQM. That’s because the ETFs allocate significant percentages of their rosters to those stocks as well as other AI-related names.', 'A new survey by Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse confirms professional market participants are backing the biggest holdings in QQQ and QQQM despite the DeepSeek headlines.', '“Of the 260 respondents, 88% said the debut of the startup’s latest model — which wiped $784 billion from the S&P 500 on Monday — will have little to no impact on the shares of the US technology behemoths in coming weeks. Few are cutting their exposure to the S&P 500, an index dominated by the massive tech companies,” according to the survey.', 'More than DeepSeek, the queried investors believe it will be domestic policy set forth by President Trump that will have a larger impact on the Mag 7 and related stocks. That could be a positive, because Trump has made clear that he wants the U.S. to be a hub of AI innovation. He even told domestic companies to up their games following the DeepSeek news.', 'Another positive could be, if accurate, the notion that the DeepSeek-induced sell-off was a case of too much, too fast as it pertained to QQQ/QQQM holdings.', '“When asked how DeepSeek’s emergence would affect their investments, 63% of survey participants said they have no plans to change their exposure to the S&P 500. More than half said this week’s rout was overblown, given questions over how DeepSeek managed to release an AI model that it claims cost a fraction of what US industry leaders spent on theirs,” according to the Bloomberg survey.', 'For more news, information, and strategy, visit the ETF Education Channel.']"

In this case, the developer’s used Nvidia’s H800 chips – a scaled down version of its H100 chip (that it exports to China).', 'What has spooked investors however, is that it’s claimed the cost to develop DeepSeek was just $6m. This is far lower than companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet have spent to develop their own AI chatbots.', 'So all of a sudden, investors are recalibrating their expectations for spending on Nvidia’s AI chips in the years ahead. If DeepSeek was built at a cost of less than $6m, maybe AI giants like Alphabet and Meta won’t have to spend tens of billions on Nvidia’s products.', 'Up until recently, it was assumed that a ton of money would be spent on Nvidia’s chips in the years ahead. For example, Meta recently said that it would spend up to $65bn on AI in 2025.', 'The outlook may have just changed.', 'Given the uncertainty, I’m not going to buy more Nvidia shares just yet.

But with earnings coming up, he may not be able to say much as it’s a ‘quiet period’ right now, meaning that companies aren’t allowed to discuss new information.', 'It’s worth noting that if we take the current earnings per share (EPS) forecast for the year ending 31 January 2026 ($4.43), the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio here’s just 29.

AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) led the dramatic sell-off, dropping by 17%.', 'So what cause all this chaos, and why did investors unload their AI stocks? Here are some of the main reasons for the sell-off and how to shape your investment strategy with that in mind.', 'The market’s reaction was triggered primarily by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company that unveiled its open-source large-language model, R1. However, this is just part of what triggered the massive sell-off.', '“DeepSeek’s emergence marks the beginning of the commoditization phase for foundation [large language models],” according to Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies.', 'DeepSeek reported that its R1 offers a much cheaper option for users. It claims it has output costs of $2.19 per 1 million tokens of output compared with OpenAI’s $60 per 1 million, as reported by CNBC. The company said it achieved this with a training cost of $5.6 million, which is a “fraction” of what other AI companies have spent, per CNBC.', 'According to ComputerWorld, DeepSeek open-sourced its R1 AI model under an MIT license, enabling global developers to modify and build upon its code for specialized applications. The company also released six smaller R1 variants optimized for consumer-grade hardware like laptops, democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities at minimal computational cost. ', 'These moves exposed vulnerabilities in the U.S. AI stocks by highlighting unsustainable spending and undermining subscription-based monetization models. ', 'Investors initially welcomed Meta’s and Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar AI budgets as commitments to innovation. However, unease has grown, as Microsoft’s $80 billion plan raised questions about short-term returns, according to The New York Times. Meta’s $65 billion outlay drew cautious optimism for its clearer revenue pathways, as reported by Bloomberg. The divergence highlighted market uncertainty about balancing growth bets with fiscal discipline.', 'These concerns intensified considering DeepSeek’s low costs. Investors may be more likely to question whether trillion-dollar companies could justify such spending with a leaner alternative emerging.', 'The recent AI stock sell-off was partly caused by the market’s heavy reliance on just a few big tech companies. The “Magnificent Seven” accounted for over half of the S&P 500’s 2024 gains. So when one of these companies stumbles, as Nvidia did recently, it could drag the entire market down.', 'This has the potential to scare investors, leading them to panic-sell and reduce their exposure.', 'The AI sector’s turbulence demands proactive strategies to balance risk and opportunity. Here’s how savvy investors could consider pivoting toward resilient approaches that leverage both innovation and financial discipline.', 'One option is to focus on companies with strong fundamentals.', '“I’d reduce exposure to pure-play AI stocks by 40% to 50%. There are many who are riding hype with no actual revenue; I’ve seen startups with $500 million valuations and $1 million in sales,” Shah said.” In other words, look at companies with historic AI revenue streams like profitable tech firms and picks-and-shovels infrastructure providers.”', 'Diversification remains one of the most effective ways investors protect themselves in the stock market.', 'With AI stocks, it could be smart to diversify portfolio exposure across different sectors, like infrastructure, applications and platforms. Exchange-traded funds could also be an excellent way to invest in AI because they tend to be broad, diversified and cost-efficient.', 'This AI hype may inflate the short-term overvalued stocks. While that’s certainly good news, long-term investors could ponder a strategic shift. Now may be a good time to pare back exposure to growth stocks and reinvest in value stocks.', 'Value stocks may not provide as much growth, but they do tend to be safer.', 'More From GOBankingRates', 'Share This Article:', '', 'Get the latest news on investing, smart money moves, & more!', 'By subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

It's also common for investors to sell a stock too quickly -- regardless of what it's doing. And while I understand the desire to reduce potential losses, allowing emotions to dictate your investing decisions is rarely a good idea, especially when it's based on a perceived problem rather than a real and tangible one."", 'Such is the case with Nvidia (NVDA 1.71%) right now. For the last two years, Nvidia has been one of the top-performing stocks in the entire market -- thanks in large part to its critical role in the artificial intelligence (AI) movement.

Let's dig in and find out."", ""Nvidia's sell-off is linked to a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek. DeepSeek has developed its own large language model (LLM), which is allegedly on par with ChatGPT from OpenAI. On the surface, this isn't surprising. But it's how the DeepSeek feat was pulled off that is causing concern."", 'IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.', ""According to some reports, DeepSeek was built with a cluster of Nvidia A100 and H800 graphics processing units (GPUs). So wouldn't that be good news for Nvidia?"", ""Well, the answer is a bit nuanced. While it could be perceived as a good thing that yet another cutting-edge AI application leverages Nvidia's hardware, the A100 and H800 are old GPUs not widely used by tech companies anymore."", ""Over the last few years, you may have heard management teams from Meta Platforms, Tesla, and many others specifically reference purchasing Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell architecture. These are Nvidia's newest and most expensive GPU products."", ""But if DeepSeek really has built something as powerful as ChatGPT using cheaper, less sophisticated infrastructure, tech companies may decide they don't need to shell out for Nvidia's latest and greatest. That's the idea that has sent investors into a full-fledged panic."", 'Dan Ives leads technology research at Wedbush Securities and has long been an Nvidia bull.

Microsoft and Meta are already complementing their Nvidia clusters with lower-cost MI300 accelerators from Advanced Micro Devices. So, demand for Nvidia's GPUs was likely to begin decelerating anyway."", ""On top of that, Nvidia has many businesses apart from its data center operation. For example, the company is a leader in gaming and is playing a huge role in the development of self-driving car software. In other words, Nvidia's future doesn't revolve around a single development. Nvidia's products power myriad AI services and the company's use cases remain broad."", ""Could DeepSeek lead to a slowdown for Nvidia's business?

U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), also took a dive.', 'But today, some of those stocks are recovering, at least to a degree. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek and its latest market impact.', 'Investor and engineer Marc Andreessen posted on X yesterday that ‘Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment.’', '|', 'DeepSeek R1 is the Chinese firm’s latest reasoning mode. “AI’s Sputnik moment” refers to the time when the Soviets leapfrogged the U.S. in the space race with the launch of the world’s first satellite, a milestone that caught America off guard.', 'Andreessen and many other tech experts seem to believe that DeepSeek is a similar milestone—and for several reasons.', 'First, not only did DeepSeek’s AI model outperform reigning U.S. champions like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s Llama, but it was made at a fraction of the cost that U.S. tech giants spent developing their homegrown LLMs. DeepSeek reportedly cost less than $6 million to train, while U.S. tech giants have spent hundreds of millions or billions to develop theirs. ', 'Second, DeepSeek was reportedly trained on midrange AI hardware—Nvidia’s H800 chips. It was previously thought that a model with such industry-defining capabilities couldn’t be trained on anything but the latest high-end chipsets.', 'Third, DeepSeek’s LLM is also more energy efficient, making it more environmentally friendly—not to mention cheaper to run.', 'These three factors made it appear that America’s tech giants vastly overspent on training their LLMs, which now appear to be inferior to DeepSeek. This also suggests that America’s major tech giants operating in the AI space, including OpenAI, Meta, and Google, aren’t as impenetrable to competition as once thought.', 'When the financial barrier to entry into creating an LLM that could compete with America’s best models was thought to be relatively high—a company would need hundreds of millions or billions in capital to enter the race—it gave America’s tech giants a competition buffer. Not many other tech companies, and certainly not upstarts, would have the financial resources to compete.', 'But now, if they can compete for just a few million dollars, America’s AI tech giants might have a lot more competition in the months ahead, threatening their AI dominance.', 'After news of DeepSeek’s achievements spread, U.S. markets sank yesterday, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq. By the end of the day, the Nasdaq had lost $1 trillion. The majority of that loss came from a sell-off of Nvidia shares.', 'As noted by CNBC, Nvidia’s stock (Nasdaq: NVDA) plummeted nearly 17% yesterday, which wiped almost $600 billion from its market cap. Other AI-adjacent stocks like chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO) fell over 17%, and OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT), fell over 2%. These and falls in other AI-related tech stocks helped account for that $1 trillion loss.', 'As for why DeepSeek sent shares tumbling, it’s because its existence—including how little it cost to train and the inferior hardware it was trained on—is a threat to the interests of some of the reigning American AI giants.', 'If advanced AI models can now be trained on lower-spec hardware, why should companies keep shoveling money to Nvidia for their latest, most costly chips? And if any company can create a high-performance LLM for a fraction of the cost that was once thought to be required, America’s AI giants are about to have much more competition than ever imagined.', 'That kind of news scares investors who have invested heavily in America’s AI tech giants over the past few years.', 'The good news for tech-heavy investors is that in premarket trading this morning, many U.S. tech stocks that plummeted yesterday are recovering today, albeit slightly.', 'As of the time of this writing, Nvidia shares are up about 5% over yesterday’s close. Broadcom shares are up about 3.4%. TSMC shares are up about 3.2%. However, shares in Microsoft and in chip-tooling maker ASML are relatively flat.', 'This doesn’t necessarily mean DeepSeek’s effect on U.S. stock markets is over. Today’s slight recovery of yesterday’s biggest losers likely suggests that some investors are seemingly catching their collective breaths as they wait to see how America’s AI leaders respond to “AI’s Sputnik moment” as the week continues.', 'ABOUT THE AUTHOR', 'Michael Grothaus is a novelist and author.
