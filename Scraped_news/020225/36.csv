This is because the AI can use a user’s personal information to inspire trust through subject lines and targeted information.', 'To achieve this, the AI collects data from various websites and identifies potential victims. In addition, spoofing is used to imitate an email address that resembles a real enquiry.', 'The consequences of such a phishing attack range from loss of money and identity theft to the complete takeover of your devices and data, from where further hacking attacks can be launched. The AI algorithms ensure that DeepPhish learns with each new attack and thus becomes increasingly dangerous.', 'AI can also be used to make attacks even more effective. It makes it particularly easy for cyber criminals to send credible requests to a large number of people, thereby increasing the probability of the phishing attack being successful.', 'Nevertheless, there are ways to protect yourself from DeepPhish attacks. These include:', 'An easy way to upgrade your security is by getting a VPN – read our guide to the best VPNs available right now.', 'To be clear, DeepPhish is in no way related to DeepSeek, the AI chatbot that has been making lots of headlines.

Here’s what you need to know and how to protect yourself.', 'The victim of one AI-powered hack attack, a security expert who was able to stop the threat before it could compromise the Gmail account in question, called it the most sophisticated phishing threat yet. If you are not a security expert, and several examples suggest even if you are, these AI-driven attacks are all but impossible to detect and the consequences of getting compromised by them are serious in the extreme. So, you would imagine, at the very least, they would be prohibitively expensive for the attackers to create and deploy, meaning they would be kept for targeting very specific victims as was the case in a recent zero-click WhatsApp attack, for example. Research from security vendor McAfee proves otherwise, I’m sad to say.', 'The State of the Scamiverse report revealed that for just $5 and in less than 10 minutes flat, a hacker can create “shockingly convincing deepfake” attacks. “The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day,” McAfee warned, adding that “these aren’t just celebrity face-swaps or entertaining memes; they’re sophisticated scams designed to separate people from their money.” A third of those scam victims, McAfee said, will lose $500 or more, while for one in ten, the cost of getting fooled can exceed $5,000.

Period.', 'When you sign up for new apps or services, you’re often asked to give access to your information in your Google Account, like your Gmail contacts, for example. Although there are built-in protections already, as you would expect, the Advanced Protection Program takes things up a notch to prevent third-party impersonators from gaining access to your account and data. “Advanced Protection allows only Google apps and verified third-party apps to access your Google Account data,” Google said, “and only with your permission.” Other than these benefits, which shouldn’t negatively impact most users and the additional security protections outweigh any inconvenience for high-risk users anyway, Google said that you may find that you receive more alerts or warnings before downloading a file or installing an app and optional security features will be automatically enabled.', '“We’ve suspended the account behind this scam,” a Gmail spokesperson said, “we have not seen evidence that this is a wide-scale tactic, but we are hardening our defenses against abusers leveraging g.co references at sign-up to further protect users.""', 'Davey Winder is a technology journalist who covers cybersecurity news and research.

Google forced to step up phishing defenses following ‘most sophisticated attack’ it has ever seen,https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/google-stepping-up-defenses-against-most-sophisticated-attack-its-ever-seen,"['Programmer warns this new phishing attack is mind-blowing', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'A new ultra-realistic phishing scam reported by a Google programmer could make a lot of us a little uneasy.', ""Zach Latta, warned in a recent blog post, “Someone just tried the most sophisticated phishing attack I've ever seen. I almost fell for it. My mind is a little blown.”"", 'Starting with a phone call from the Caller ID ‘Google’, this phishing attempt was enough to convince a Google programmer into being one button press away from disaster - here’s what we know so far.', ""On the other side of Latta's phone call, which is a genuine number associated with Google Assistant calls, was a ‘Google engineer’ called Chloe."", 'The connection was ‘super clear’, with Latta noting the scammer had an American accent, and claimed to be from Google Workspace - asking if he had recently attempted to log into his account from Frankfurt, Germany.', 'From there, the programmer asked if ‘Chloe’ could confirm this by emailing from an official Google email. Worryingly, the scammer obliged, and sent Latta an incredibly official looking email with a case number.', 'Not only was the email sent, but it was sent from the address ‘workspace-noreply@ google.com’, and related to his ‘password for important.g.co’ which the attacker claimed was an internal Google subnet. This is important, because even our own TechRadar phishing advice identifies this as a serious indication of risk.', 'Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!', 'But g.co is an official Google URL - which is confirmed by Google and even has its own Wikipedia page. Latta, being a tech worker, knew to verify the phone number, so Googled the number - and was encouraged to do so by the scammer, who advised him to quote his case number if he called. The number is listed on google.com pages, which was enough to placate Latta enough.', ""The scammer was encouraging Latta to carry out a ‘sessions reset’, on his device, which rang alarm bells for the programmer. The scam's first stumbling block came when Latta checked his Google Workspace logs himself, and of course, didn’t find any suspicious activity."", 'When pressed, the scam began to unravel - with the attacker transferring to a manager who further encouraged Latta to log out from all devices and reset his password. Shockingly, the scammer was able to provide the genuine MFA code that was sent to Latta, which, if entered, would’ve given the attackers access to Latta’s account.', 'Thankfully, Latta was able to spot the red flags and by this point, was already suspicious enough to avoid handing his account over - but the scammer got close, Latta admitted.', ""“Literally 1 button press from being completely pwned. And I'm pretty technical!”"", 'This particular attack has made Google up its defenses in response.', '“We’ve suspended the account behind this scam, which abused an unverified Workspace account to send these misleading emails"" a Google spokesperson told TechRadarPro.', '""We have not seen evidence that this is a wide scale tactic, but we are hardening our defenses against abusers leveraging g.co references at sign up to further protect users.""', 'Google also reiterated: ""Google will not call you to reset your password or troubleshoot account issues.”', 'The news follows a trend of cybercriminals deploying smarter and more frequent attacks, in part enabled by the advent of AI. This particular scam even bypassed MFA and used a legitimate Google domain, so even the most tech-savvy among us should be on the lookout.', 'What’s concerning about this scam in particular is that it has found workarounds for some of the classic tell-tale signs of a scam. As Latta said,', '“The thing that\'s crazy is that if I followed the 2 ""best practices"" of verifying the phone number + getting them to send an email to you from a legit domain, I would have been compromised.”', 'Checking the legitimacy of the email and phone number is pretty much the first recommendation for any unexpected communications - and that’s still good advice, but clearly it will only filter out the lower level attacks at this point. If you’re not sure what exactly a phishing attack is, we’ve put together an explainer.', 'That said, remaining suspicious of any and all unknown communications, especially those urging action, really is the best defense against phishing attacks.', 'In the kindest way possible, it’s unlikely you’re important enough for Google to be concerned enough to call you about your personal email account - so be very wary of anyone reaching out to you out of nowhere.', 'A Google spokesperson told TheRegister, “As a reminder, Google will not call users to reset their passwords or troubleshoot account issues, so feel free to treat any incoming calls as the garbage they are.”', 'Look out for any obvious markers, like bad spelling or grammar - and be mindful of which organizations would already know your name - it’s unlikely your bank would start an email with ‘Dear customer’.', 'Alongside that, avoid clicking any links on emails from people you don’t know, and don’t open attachments or scan QR codes either.
