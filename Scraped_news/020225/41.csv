A lapsed fan's guide to WWE Royal Rumble 2025,https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/43627129/wwe-royal-rumble-2025-cody-rhodes-cm-punk-kevin-owens-rhea-ripley-john-cena,"[""As a service to fans who have a general interest in WWE but might not have watched a match in months, we're happy to provide this FAQ as a guide to Royal Rumble 2025, scheduled for Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Saturday."", ""The Royal Rumble isn't just an excuse to hear 60 bangin' theme songs, revel in surprise debuts and shocking returns, and watch a group of people put their differences aside to work together and hurl their biggest obstacle over the top rope -- which is quite a utopian concept when you think about it."", ""No, the Royal Rumble primarily exists to reward one man and one woman with the chance to wrestle for a world championship at that showcase of the immortals, April's WrestleMania 41 -- and more importantly, the right to dramatically point to the WrestleMania sign above the ring as the credits roll on Raw or SmackDown, aka every young wrestler's dream."", 'To set the current landscape: Rhea Ripley is the women\'s world champion, in her second reign with the strap. Tiffany Stratton is the WWE women\'s champion, after turning on Nia Jax and cashing in her Money in the Bank contract to win the title from Jax in early January because it was apparently ""Tiffy Time.""', 'On the men\'s side, there are two long-reigning champions: Gunther, who has been world heavyweight champion since SummerSlam in August; and the current face of the WWE, Cody Rhodes, who famously ""finished the story"" at WrestleMania 40 last April when he defeated Roman Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match to become the undisputed WWE champion.', 'His new story could be titled ""Heavy Is the Head That Wears the Crown,"" as the champion struggles with his new caste and a decent amount of paranoia as he defends the belt against Kevin Owens at the Rumble.', ""After Owens lost to Rhodes at Bash in Berlin last August and failed to win the title on Saturday Night's Main Event in December, this long-standing feud reaches new heights literally at the Royal Rumble, as the two square off in a ladder match for the titles."", 'Yes, we said ""titles.""', 'Fueling this feud is KO\'s searing jealousy of Cody\'s success. Owens claims he should have all the things that Rhodes has in WWE. That\'s because Owens stuck around for a decade while Rhodes quit the promotion, leaving the ""Stardust"" character behind and rebuilding his career on the indie circuit.', 'To illustrate how Owens covets the Cody-verse, he stole the winged eagle-design WWE championship that Rhodes was gifted last month by WWE chief content officer Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque on Saturday Night\'s Main Event and began referring to himself as the ""true WWE champion.""', ""So both belts will be dangling above the ring at the Rumble. Rhodes and KO signed their contracts last weekend ... with Owens taking some Shawn Michaels' Sweet Chin Music after mocking the WWE legend during the signing. I wonder if there's any carryover there."", '(By the way, kudos to the WWE for finally coming up with a belt-hanger technology that is both aesthetically pleasing and potentially botch-proof. It also looks like it could support a decent amount of weight as a zipline handle, if necessary.)', '""I\'m the real champ!"" belt shenanigans are a timeless wrestling trope, used by everyone including Ric Flair and CM Punk. But Owens has used it as a great bit of escalation in what otherwise seems like a transitional feud for Rhodes before WrestleMania.', 'KO has always had a gift for ramping up the animosity and the intrigue. Witness his multiple vicious attacks on Rhodes. And his specially designed T-shirts, like the one that read ""Cody Sucks Eggs"" and the one where Owens\' face was placed on a photo of Cody\'s deceased father, Dusty Rhodes, with the words ""Canadian Dream"" underneath.', ""And the fact that Rhodes might not be able to trust one of his allies, Sami Zayn, when it comes to this match's outcome."", 'A longtime friend (and frenemy) of Kevin Owens, Zayn has recently had two ""oopsies"" in the ring when trying to deliver a Helluva Kick to Drew McIntyre. Seth Rollins was kicked in the head on his first miss. Rhodes ate the boot on the second.', 'Whether these kicks were accidental has been a point of debate, although Zayn has apologized for both. But our scruffy hero has also been offered the following scenario from Owens:', ""He'll have Zayn's back in the Royal Rumble if Zayn is there when Owens needs him against Rhodes. If they both win their respective matches, Sami and KO will main-event WrestleMania."", 'Is that tempting enough for Zayn to turn against Rhodes?', 'Of course, Zayn isn\'t the only buddy Rhodes has to worry about impacting his title reign. There\'s also CM Punk, who is such a good friend to Rhodes that he recently promised he\'d ""stab him from the front"" instead of the back. How thoughtful!', 'Punk has never won the Royal Rumble. In a related note, he has never main-evented WrestleMania, either. Punk has vowed to remedy both of these issues Saturday by winning the Rumble and challenging Rhodes for his title (should he successfully defend it against Owens).', 'On Raw Is Netflix this week, Punk cut one of those promos that only he can cut: saying that he loves Rhodes because of Dusty and that ""I promise you I will always be your friend,"" while spelling out how Cody is cracking under the pressure of the day-to-day sacrifices of a babyface champion\'s reign; and then vowing to ease that burden by taking his title at WrestleMania. Delicious stuff.', 'One of the hallmarks of Paul Levesque\'s WWE is how different storylines bounce off each other like bumper cars. We can\'t mention Punk here without noting that his former mentor, Paul Heyman, promised him ""a favor"" in exchange for joining the O.G. Bloodline team at Survivor Series: WarGames last November.', ""Could the Wise Man's favor assist Punk in getting his WrestleMania moment?"", 'That\'s the same Paul Heyman, by the way, who was asked to deliver a message to Punk from Drew McIntyre recently: He planned to beat Punk ""within an inch of his life"" and then ""throw his lifeless carcass over the top rope.""', 'Here are the competitors who have declared for the Rumble as of Monday night:', 'CM Punk', 'Drew McIntyre', 'Sami Zayn', 'Seth Rollins', 'Roman Reigns', 'LA Knight', 'Jey Uso', 'Rey Mysterio', 'Shinsuke Nakamura', 'Chad Gable', 'Bron Breakker', 'Logan Paul', 'Penta', 'Penta, also known as Pentag√≥n Jr., is the spooky-masked luchador who made the leap from AEW to the WWE in January.', 'Paul and Rollins have expressed interest in wrestling Gunther for his WWE heavyweight championship. Gunther, in turn, expressed interest in pounding Logan into schnitzel.', ""Having Roman Reigns in the Rumble creates its own intrigue. He won the event in 2015, and he's going to be doing something at WrestleMania."", 'Would a surprise appearance by The Rock in the Rumble blow the dome off the building in Indianapolis?', ""So, there are a lot of possibilities in the men's Rumble. But there is one potential winner getting the most notice."", ""Which is strange because you can't see him."", ""Please recall that Cena made a surprise return at Money in the Bank last July to announce that he was retiring ... eventually, as he'll be on his farewell tour through the end of 2025. He said WrestleMania 41 will be his last in-ring appearance in the WWE's signature event."", ""This announcement puts a ticking clock on Cena's chances to break Ric Flair's record for WWE world championship wins, as they're currently tied with 16. Winning the Rumble would give him a direct path to a title match and the chance to break the record."", 'But is there more money in the WrestleMania moment or the championship chase?', 'More importantly: Is there any chance Cena enters the Rumble as Peacemaker?', ""Between the Judgment Day, the various Bloodlines, NXT and all those superstars who appear on Raw and SmackDown either in the ring or in the back ... there aren't many spots open for surprises. (Especially if you consider Cena's presence as checking the nostalgia act box.)"", ""But there's one name we're fairly certain will enter the Rumble this year. Because when you say his name, he appears: Joe Hendry, of the infectious theme song and TNA world championship. Not only because he's popped onto NXT a few times, but because the WWE and TNA announced a working relationship recently."", 'But yeah, mostly because of that theme song.', ""The queen has returned! The story is Charlotte Flair. The 14-time champion hasn't wrestled since suffering a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in a match back in December 2023. She declared her return to the WWE and entrance into the Rumble via a video whose cinematography and soundtrack would have been at home on a Netflix reality show about high-end real estate agents."", 'If there\'s a championship shot on the line and Charlotte Flair is in the match ... well, she has won the Rumble once, and three times she has been in the final two. You do the math. Why WWE decided to ""spoil"" Flair\'s return ahead of the Rumble is worth asking. She\'s the kind of surprise entrant who would have been a major story in the match. Perhaps there\'s another surprise return that would have overshadowed Flair\'s comeback from injury?', 'The wrestlers who have declared for the Rumble so far:', 'Bayley', 'Liv Morgan', 'Bianca Belair', 'Naomi', 'Nia Jax', 'Charlotte Flair', 'Lyra Valkyria', 'Ivy Nile', 'Raquel Rodriguez', 'Iyo Sky', ""Please recall Bayley won the Rumble last year and then took the WWE women's title from Sky."", 'Morgan and Rodriguez are members of the Judgment Day group and have been feuding with women\'s tag team champs Belair and Naomi. Morgan recently saw her 226-day women\'s world championship reign end at the hands of Ripley, although she continues to hold a slightly less prestigious title: on-screen love interest of ""Dirty"" Dominik Mysterio.', 'Have you ever walked out of a theater disappointed because the movie you had in your head was better than the one they actually made?', ""That's the problem with this year's women's Royal Rumble. There are so many stars who have been out for an extended period and could return, turning this match into an all-timer full of talent and surprises. But you don't want to be too disappointed if they don't."", ""We're talking about names such as Becky Lynch, who was rumored to be returning on the WWE's Netflix Raw debut, but did not appear on air. She has been taking time away from wrestling since May. What about Alexa Bliss, who's been missing for about a year? Or Asuka, who has been recovering from knee surgery for several months?"", ""Jade Cargill was written off TV in November after a storyline injury; she's just the kind of powerhouse who is made for Rumble drama. Nikki Bella appeared on Raw recently, sparking comeback talks, too."", 'Jordynne Grace was a surprise entrant in the Rumble last year. The former TNA champ is reportedly signed with the WWE, so another Rumble run is in the cards. What about current TNA champ Masha Slamovich?', 'Perhaps most shocking would be AJ Lee, who hasn\'t competed in WWE in over a decade. She remains in the ""we\'ll believe it when we see it"" category, but the reaction would be massive if she ever returned. As her husband, CM Punk, reminded us: Never say never.', ""Yeah, a little match for the WWE tag team championships between two of the best duos of the past 15 years: #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa) vs. Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin). It's a best-two-out-of-three-falls match between teams that have traded the belts over the past few months. #DIY are the heels in the match. Who wins: underhanded tactics or high spots?"", ""Again, credit to the WWE: Several plausible outcomes in both Rumbles could produce compelling opponents for the current champions. This is why it'll probably end up being John Cena and Charlotte Flair as the final Rumblers standing, and we'll all feel dumb for not realizing that sometimes the obvious thing is obvious."", '', '', '']"

She doesn't look too concerned, she's dancing en route to the ring. She has the wind to go far, she's tough, she has a shot."", ""Well, that's not good for her chance at getting a shot at Mami. It's Judgement Day vs. Damage CTRL as we kick off the 2025 Royal Rumble. Morgan is also smiling. I thought she'd have a chance at winning it, but from No. 2, that's a big ask. Either way, this is a great way to kick off the show, with two former champions butting heads for the right to get their title back."", ""They exchange headlines and then go back to wrestling. They're both flying around early! Iyo gets backdropped onto the apron, but she fights back with a kick and springboards back in. Liv now is thrown to the apron, but she is able to hang on to the rope. The way they balance themselves is crazy."", 'The NXT star is out next and the former champion wastes no time getting involved, slapping Sky silly before doing the same to Liv. Sky is whooping up on Liv and Iyo and she hits a combo DDT/Russian leg sweep and the fans like that. Liv goes over the top rope again, but she hangs on again. Sky dumps Perez over, but she fights off. Morgan hits a codebreaker on Perez.', ""The Women's Intercontinental champion Valkyria is next in, and all four women are still alive. She hits a tornado DDT into a fishermen's suplex on Sky. Valkyra has a problem with her shirt and Morgan slaps her. Now the first three women in are battling it out while Valkyria fixes her wardrobe malfunction."", ""The most entertaining woman on the roster is out next, the U.S. Champion. She has fun with the crowd, before entering the ring and she buys a round of slaps for the girls in the ring. She just threw all four girls out to the apron, but nobody was eliminated. Sadly, she doesn't know it. Now they're back and she's shocked and that's why she's the most entertaining person in the division. All of the girls gang up on her, beat her up and now she's down."", ""B-Fab is the next one out. Michin's new tag team partner runs to the ring and is ready to rock. She slams Morgan onto Valkyria and she tries to throw Sky out of the ring. Nobody eliminated yet. It's nice that the stats are up on the bottom. It gives it a sports like feel!"", 'The Pitbull is out next. I liked her until she sided with Chad Gable. Now, not so much. She\'s running to the ring and is getting the ""You Suck"" chant. Huge shoutout to Kurt Angle, and a great tribute to a younger star! Nile hits a double German suplex, so she\'s learned from Chad! Still nobody eliminated.', 'Another young star comes to the ring, she flips in and hits a Tazplex on Sky. Then a superkick. Zoey gets thrown to the apron, but comes back with a blockbuster from the top rope. The match is 13 minutes old, nobody has been tossed. Liv tried to kick', ""One of the powerhouses enter the ring, the NXT star hits the ring in a hurry. She clears house. She's now spinning Nile around like she's a weapon. What's new. Ends it with a powerbomb before B-Fab clobbers her. The two are now beating each other up pretty good. They both hit big boots, and Chelsea Green eliminates B-Fab. So one down, 28 to go."", ""A former Wrestlemania main eventer enters the ring now, as the EST dances her way in before hitting a flying cross body on Green. It's impossible to write all that's going on, but I'll say this, it's crazy they can keep from hitting the floor by hanging on to the ropes. They have to be slippery and they're holding on with one hand. It's pretty amazing. Belair is killing it, beating up pretty much everyone in the ring."", ""One of the most underrated wrestlers in the world comes in the ring and starts tearing things up early. Baszler was the best NXT champ and she could do the same in WWE. She needs a chance. But she's doing great in there. And Ivy Nile eliminates Valkyria. So two down."", ""Last year's winner enters the ring as Bayley makes her way to the ring. She cleans house and goes head to head with Iyo Sky, her former friend in Damage CTRL. But they are interrupted by Baszler."", ""The pride of Seneca High School has made her way to the ring. I'd love to see her win, she needs a breakthrough victory, and she has her teammates with her, so she could do some damage here. Still only two competitors gone."", ""One of the most improved wrestlers hits the wring, Dupri. She is immediately attacked by her former friend Nile. Then she hits her Ravishing Rick Rude dance, which I enjoyed. Pure Fusion Collective tried to gang up on Dupri, but they're cut off, she hits the backwards worm and eliminates Nile. Good for her. But then Dupri is dumped by PFC. Oh well, good showing for her."", ""Bianca Belair's tag team partner Naomi hits the ring. I hope Cargill joins soon so we see what happens. Where will Belair's loyalty go? We have 11 women in, four eliminated and 15 still to come. Good action so far. The tag champs are working together. Zoey Stark is gone, as is Baszler and Deville. That's a shame. All PFC is gone. Too soon! We are now down 7 competitors."", ""Another NXT star is out next, making her first Rumble match. The herd has been thinned, we only have nine women in the ring. Once again, Green is so funny. She's so great. Lash Legend was tossed by Green. Green is having a nice rumble and the fans are chanting Chelsea!"", ""Green's former tag team partner is out next. As great as Green is, Niven plays a huge part in the act and I really enjoy her shenanigans. Niven comes in and beats up the tag champs. She hits a double splash on them. She's just beating up on everyone. Niven accidentally eliminates Green. Too bad, was hoping she'd stick around."", ""The Hart Dynasty star is headed to the ring. I'm not sure if anyone likes wrestling more than her. And she likes cats. So it's hard not to be a fan of hers. She tries to toss some girls. Some of these stars have been in there 30 minutes. That ain't easy my friend. Nine girls have been tossed so far."", ""The former TNA champion is bound for glory in the Royal Rumble. She is officially signed with WWE. i'm really happy for her. She hit an amazing slam on Niven."", 'One of the Smackdown stars Michin is out next and she does what she does. She cleans house.', ""She's back! After having a baby, Bliss is back and she looks to be evil. The crowd loves her, so it doesn't matter, but she is here and is back! As Bliss hits her moveset, the fans are going nuts. So far, this match has had two great surprises, and both have been recent. The match is in full gear now."", ""Vega has really worked hard to get to the WWE, and it would be fun to see her win it. I don't think it'll happen, but would be fun. There are 12 women in the ring, 10 out, eight still to come. The tag champs are working together."", ""The women's speed champion is out next, but she's in no hurry to get to the ring. Well, after celebrating, she hustles a little. Lots of action"", 'The NXT star is making her debut. She enters with a flying cross body.', ""The former WWE champion and hall of famer Trish Stratus is out next. Who wouldn't want to see her win. A seven time champion! She tries for her bulldog, but Grace catches her. And she hits a bulldog off the top rope. Trish is killing it. She looks great."", 'Liv Morgan has a friend. Her Diesel bodyguard makes her way to the ring and starts beating up everyone. Natalya is eliminated by Morgan. Bliss tries to throw out Morgan, but she turns the tables. Bliss is out and the fans are not happy.', ""The champ is here. My prediction to win this is walking to the ring, the Queen has arrived and is back from her knee injury. The pop these women are getting really tells you how exciting women's wrestling is. They are every bit as loved as the men. It's so fun to see. While she makes her way to the ring, it's probably time for the next star to get there. She comes in and hits clotheslines and chops and the fans are whooing right along. Welcome back, Queen. She's showing Grace how they do things in WWE. She throws out Michin. Then hits the top rope and flies into a group. She then reverses a double suplex into a DDT. But Niven cuts her off. Then she dumps Niven over the top."", ""NXT Women's Champion is out next. If she wins, she likely won't challenge herself, I'm guessing. She squares right off with Sky, which is smart because she's been in since the start. We only have two left. to come out. I'm going to guess one is Becky Lynch. Grace is eliminated by the NXT champ. I wonder if Grace is headed there. I'd watch that feud. Look, it's NXT vs. WWE! Pretty cool they're loyal to their brands."", ""Business is about to pick up, Nia Jax is making her way to the ring. She's slow going out. It's fair to think Jax has a good chance at winning this. Disappointed Grace didn't last longer, but that's a good thing. Just another star for WWE. LaRea is out. Trish was about to toss Jax, but LaRae grabbed her foot, allowing Jax to throw out Trish."", ""Welp, it was a return, but not Becky. Nikki Bella has returned to WWE, at least for tonight. Everyone is in, now it's officially a battle royal. Now they're all eyeing Jax and looks like they're going to toss her. It's 11 on one right now, but so far, one is winning. She just tossed them all to the ground. Now they're teeing off on her. Nikki Bella is doing pushups. So is Perez. Bella tries to give Perez an attitude adjustment as she throws her out, but she never hits the ground. Half the match is on the apron. Five of the 12 women are hanging on the apron after getting tossed. Jax just throw out Vaquer, Sky, Morgan and Belair. Oh, and Naomi. Wow. We are down to the select six."", ""The NXT champ is one, it's down to five, Bayley, Perez, Jax, Bella and Flair. Make that four, Bayley is toast. So is Bella. Charlotte, Perez and Flair are left. Perez attacks Flair's knee. Jax dumps Perez to the apron, Flair throws out Jax, then Perez."", ""In her return from a bad knee injury, Charlotte Flair wins her second Royal Rumble. She gets a title match at Wrestlemania. She points to the Wrestlemania sign. It's official, the Queen is back!"", ""Other than fun moments like Grace's debut, Stratus' return and Flair winning, two people who stood out were Niven and Dupri. They both put on great performances, and hopefully that will springboard them to bigger things. Dupri got ripped earlier this year by fans. I thought that was terrible then, and I'm happy she starred tonight for a few seconds."", ""Who doesn't want to see Rhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair again? We all should. But I have a feeling Charlotte's going to be on Tiffy Time in Vegas. You can't go wrong with either, but I predict she takes on Ms. Money in the Bank."", ""Next up is the tag title match, two out of three falls. I'm not sure who is going to win this, but it's going to be a great match. The challengers are on their way to the ring. I'm not saying this is the best two tag teams in the world today, but they might be. Next up are the underhanded, devious champions."", ""The teams are going back and forth, but DIY has control and they're taking it to Sabin. Shelly makes a quick tag and eats a knee. Then is pinned, DIY takes a 1-0 lead."", 'That was pretty neat. DIY missed a tag, Alex Shelly thought they made the tag, then he ate a knee and found himself trailing.', ""Good action so far, but it hasn't kicked into second gear. It will. The bad guys are keeping control for most of the second fall. Sabin tags in and turns the tables. Hits a pair of big kicks off the apron onto DIY and then hits a flying crossbody block onto both of the champs."", 'The Motor City Machine Guns hit their finisher on Gargano and tie things up.', 'After hitting their finisher, the two sides are going down to the wire.', ""DIY hit a double team move but are unable to get the three count. Gargano hits a flying body block, Tommaso Ciampa hits a crazy backbreaker, but is unable to get the three. Sabin is taking a lot of punishment from Ciampa, but Sabin pushes him into the ring post from the middle rope. That looked nasty. MCMG hit a blockbuster off the top rope, but Ciampa is saved by his partner. Gargano hits a superkick on his partner (accident) and the MCMG go to town. Angelo Dawkins just hit Shelly with a crutch. DIY meets in the middle and they win the match. I guess the Street Profits are officially bad guys. That's a shame."", ""Maybe the Profits aren't good guys. Now they're beating up DIY with the crutch. They stand over the champs holding the titles. I guess the Profits aren't good guys, they're not bad guys. They're the top contenders for the championship!"", ""Since they're in Indy, they're showing some McAfee's big plays, including his big hit, a great fake punt and various other times McAfee showed he was the top punter in the game at the time. I did not like him when he was a punter."", ""I guess my surprise isn't happening, because Rob Van Dam isn't in the locker room. He's sitting in the crowd with his wife Katie Forbes. RVD is one of the good guys in the game. He also recently started OnlyWrestlers, which will soon hold its first show."", ""Kevin Owens is out first. He's a top top guy, and he's still underrated. Another guy, whatever role they have for him, he's awesome. WWE's roster is stacked with dudes like him, maybe not as good as him, but guys who are great at whatever you ask of them. And Cody is out next. He's been everything WWE would want in a champ and more. Cody has only defended his title eight times? That seems low. I guess a lot of his matches have been non-title, and he did have some tag team matches. Cody's entrance has taken a while. You'd think he'd be eager to start the bout. The belts are being hooked up, it's time to find out who the rightful champ is. I'm pulling for KO since, as much as I love Roman Reigns, Owens has a great point. He should be mad at Cody for turning his back on him and helping his enemy."", ""I ain't alone. The fans are screaming for KO. Good. I'm glad people see that he was wronged here. The two are going to war and now they're fighting throughout the stadium. They're back in the ring and they're using the ladders. Things are getting brutal. KO nearly went for a splash off a 5 foot ladder, but he didn't want to take the high risk."", 'Rhodes tried to get to the top and he grabs the latch holding the belts, but Owens removes the ladder. Cody was unable to bring them down, but Owens was able to pull Rhodes down. Cody is hurt.', 'Owens continues the assault. Rhodes is taking a beating, Owens brings another ladder in the ring. Owens just got backdropped on a ladder, which was sitting on its side. That had to hurt so much. Right on the edge it looks like Ouch.', ""Now they're even, Cody is powerbombed onto the ladder. I can't imagine how bad that hurts. I get upset when I bang my knee getting in my car. Owens tries to get the gold, but he's caught from behind. And Owens hits a fisherman's buster onto a ladder. Both guys are down. Both guys are hurt. It's a shame nobody has a Money in the Bank contract, now would be an ideal time."", ""Sami Zayn comes out to check on Owens. Now he's checking on Cody. Is he there to help KO? Is he there to check on his friends? Who knows. Owens looks like Apollo Creed, climbing to his feet with the help of the ropes. He goes for a stunner, but Cody hits a Cross Rhodes."", ""Owens is taking a beating and he's busted wide open. He's wearing the crimson mask. He got juice! Any other good ones? Rhodes is attacking the open wound atop Owens' head. This is the most fire Cody has ever showed, possibly, and that's pretty cool. Rhodes looks obsessed with getting as much blood as possible from his foe, but then he took a shot in the plums. Owens goes for a pile driver but Cody reverses it into an Alabama Slam from the table through the ladder. Cody is climbing the ladder and he wins the titles. Cody is your champion."", ""Rhodes pulled it off after a brutal match. Great match! I guess Cody will watch the Rumble to determine his potential challenger, while Owens will be taking an ice bath. Both men beat the heck out of each other. Owens looks terrible. I hope he's just doing a great job pretending because he took a heck of a shot on that slam. Rhodes is standing over KO celebrating."", ""Looks like WWE is getting a new show. March 5, WWE Evolve will air on Tubi, the free online network. That show, I'm guessing, will have up and comers on, and if you watch NXT, you know that can be some of the best wrestling out there. That's a Wednesday, so it looks like AEW will have competition, at least that week."", ""We are four weeks away from the next PLE, when Toronto hosts the Elimination Chamber. That typically sets up championship matches for Wrestlemania, so that's a big one."", ""We're now slated to see who will main event Wrestlemania. Big E is wearing a suit, so he probably won't be competing. I would hope he'd be warming up if he was entering his first match in a few years. I really hope Big E can return if that's what he wants to do. But if he never wrestles again, I'll be fine with it because he's happy, healthy and that's the most important thing. He is another guy who comes off as one of the best dudes out there."", ""And we're about to get started with our first two competitors. In about an hour, we'll know who is bound for Vegas. Well, most will be bound for Vegas, but only one gets a golden ticket."", ""They're starting with a hall of famer. The LWO leader has won the Royal Rumble before when he was the No. 2 entrant and went on to win the title at Wrestlemania when he defeated Kurt Angle and Randy Orton in a triple threat match. Can he do it again?"", ""Wow, another Lucha star, the newest addition to the WWE men's roster, Penta is out next. What a start to his career. This will be interesting to see these two start out, you know we're going to see things we probably haven't seen before."", ""The fans go nuts as Mysterio and Penta square off after shaking hands. Gotta be one of the coolest moments of Penta's career. He's been a star for years, but this is pretty cool. They are now pounding away and it's as fast as you'd expect."", ""Penta's first opponent and Mysterio's son's running buddy Chad Gable is out next. Gable slingshots Rey over the top rope, but he holds on. Penta hits a super kick to the back of Gable's head. They hit a double team splash on Gable and Mysterio landed right on his knees."", ""Another young star joins the mix with the former NXT star who is now killing it on the main roster. He squares off with Mysterio and takes control. Four guys in, nobody out, we're just getting started and the action has been great so far."", 'Lots of Luchadores early, and he joins the ring by immediately DDTing Gable. Escobar hits a 619 on Rey, before getting picked off by Penta. They\'re going at it and Penta gets hit with a ""Mexican"" Destroyer. Gable has throwing everyone out, but nobody went over. Then he gets drilled with a quadruple super kick.', ""OK, so everyone in the ring has a beef with Gable. It's three Lucha wrestlers, Hayes who has no friends and now Otis. He starts out with a chokeslam on Escobar, then he goes for the worm/caterpillar, but as he's down, Gable locks in the ankle lock. Now the two are squaring off in the middle. Gable hits a German suplex. Gable celebrates, he gets put in the torture rack."", 'The son of the Dogfaced Gremlin, the nephew of the Big Bad Booty Daddy and one of the best athletes in the world is out next. He throws out Hayes. He hits a Frankensteiner on Gable from the top rope. He overhead throws Otis. He runs through Mysterio. He spears Escobar who was holding Penta. Then he throws out Escobar. Two down.', ""Before he can get to the ring, he's pounded by Hayes. Instead, he's being replaced by Speed!"", 'Famous streamer runs to the ring and eliminates Otis. He celebrates with Bronn, who is going to kill him, I think. And he does. He just ran right through him with a spear. Then, he press slams him and throws him into Otis. Otis catches him and throws him over the table. Poor IShowspeed. Very irresponsible of HHH to send him to the ring.', ""The toughest Irishman is out next, he has a win to his credit. He gets to the ring and starts pounding on Gable. Gable must be the toughest guy in there because everyone goes after him. As soon as he enters the ring, he gets clotheslined over the top by Penta, but he holds on. Breakker is the man, he's showing the world how good he is. As soon as I say that, he eats a kick from Sheamus."", ""Jimmy is out next. One of the best in the Bloodline is the first one out. He's looking good thus far. Uso hits a nice backflip senton on Penta. Fans are behind Jimmy as he buttheads Mysterio and Gable. Now he gives one to Penta. And he attacks Sheamus. That was a mistake."", ""A win here would mark the second time a husband and wife won the Royal Rumble the same year. Seth and Becky did it one year. I don't think that will happen her. Andrade is beating up everyone, but Penta throws him over the ropes and tries to eliminate him. He's not having much success. Still only four guys out. Breakker is close, Sheamus has him over, but looks like he's holding on. Penta hits a superplex on Andrade."", ""Well, things are going to get interesting here. The craziest member of the WWE roster is out and he does what you'd think he would do. Hurts everyone. He's squaring off with Penta and that didn't go well for Penta. Fatu than stacks Penta and Mysterio for a Samoan drop. He then eliminates Gable, Mysterio and Andrade. Now he's facing off with Breakker."", ""Gunther's friend is out next and he'd be stupid to rush in. It's only stars in there, you're better off buying time, and that's exactly what he's doing. This isn't cheating, it's smart. The ring is full of killers. It's way safer outside, and you can't get thrown out. He goes in and goes right out. Kaiser was in for about a second. Wait, it was two seconds, so it's not a record! Breakker was thrown out, but hung on. That's not easy for a guy his size to do that."", 'The most underrated wrestler in the world is out next. The Miz tried to toss Breaker, hits his finisher on Uso and then gets taken down by Penta. Mysterio hits a Frankensteiner.

I miss managers at the Royal Rumble. Those were always fun. Reigns throws out the Miz. Spears Sheamus and clotheslines him over. Joe Hendry goes after Roman. He gets speared and eliminated. Now it's Bronn and Roman squaring off. So many cool faceoffs. Wow, Breakker hits the spear on Roman. But Reigns turns the table and throws out Breakker. That's a money match we have to see. Jimmy Uso is out. It's now down to three guys, Roman, Penta and Fatu, with the two Samoans ready to square off. This is another match that has to happen. Fatu throws first punch, Reigns fires back.

This Royal Rumble has so many great stars, and it's showing every time a guy comes out. Whenever they square off with someone, I think 'that's a great match.' 'That's another great match.' That's how you want your promotion to look in matches like this. Penta is tossed by Balor. Penta really shined tonight, which shouldn't surprise anyone."", ""This is good for Roman. He's getting backup in the form of his cousin. Since everyone in the ring hates Roman, this will help. Uso goes right after his foes. He hits a nice reverse Frankensteiner on Fatu.

Among those confirmed as entrants are John Cena, Roman Reigns, CM Punk, Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre and more. But there are still 15 slots that are to be determined and WWE CCO Paul Levesque said you can expect plenty of wildness on Saturday night at Lucas Oil Stadium. "", '""I\'m thinking about the Royal Rumble,"" Levesque said at the Royal Rumble kickoff on Friday. ""It makes me think, just about anybody could enter the Royal Rumble as a surprise. [Turns to Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton] You got a minute?"" ', ""The women's Rumble match will also have plenty of both, and even more given that only 10 entrants have been announced. But among the most notable is the return of Charlotte Flair after more than a year away to recover from a nasty knee injury."", 'There are only two matches beyond the Rumbles on the card for Saturday, but they are sure to deliver the excitement. WWE undisputed champion Cody Rhodes puts his title on the line against friend turned foe Kevin Owens in a ladder match. Plus, the WWE tag team championships are on the line when titleholders #DIY take on Motor City Machine Guns in a two-out-of-three falls match.', ""Let's take a look at who the CBS Sports experts are picking to win in each match on Saturday's card, beginning at 6 p.m. ET."", ""Men's Royal Rumble Match: I felt somewhat certain that John Cena would win the Rumble until Monday night. CM Punk's confrontation with Cody Rhodes sparked something that made it clear Punk vs. Rhodes is the story WWE should be telling as much as possible. Of course, there's also just the fact that momentum has completely stalled out for Cena when his big return for his last run started with a somewhat awkward promo on Jan. 6 and he has been nonexistent since. Sure, he could still win the Rumble and go on to up his appearances between the Rumble and WrestleMania, but his absence has killed my interest while Rhodes and Punk have me excited. I think WWE wants to play into the classic rivalry between Punk and Cena and the match likely comes down to those two men at the end but give me Punk to get the win and Cena to punch his own ticket at Elimination Chamber -- a complete reversal of what I predicted just a few weeks ago. Pick: CM Punk wins the Royal Rumble -- Brent Brookhouse"", 'I woke up this morning believing Cena would win the Rumble, but I\'m having second thoughts. A straight shot to WrestleMania is too convenient for the down-on-his-luck veteran seeking glory one last time. Orton isn\'t advertised for the Rumble, but I suspect he\'ll pull out a surprise victory to set up a showdown with Rhodes at WrestleMania. Orton won\'t tie Cena\'s world title record, but he can tie ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin\'s three Rumble wins. Pick: Randy Orton wins the Royal Rumble -- Shakiel Mahjouri', ""Women's Royal Rumble Match: Charlotte Flair is such an easy plug-and-play option for the biggest WrestleMania matches that it's hard not to pick her to win here. The inevitable match with Tiffany Stratton also makes too much sense to pass up. Stratton vs. Flair feels like a potential passing of the torch moment, even if Flair will be around for as long as she wants. They're similar enough wrestlers while separated enough by the eras in which they entered the game to provide plenty of compelling storytelling before a tremendous WrestleMania match. Pick: Charlotte Flair wins the Royal Rumble -- Brookhouse"", ""There aren't many standouts among this year's women's Rumble participants. Booking Flair opposite Tiffany Stratton for WrestleMania is a great way to boost Stratton's profile. Flair can be trusted to deliver in big matches, so she might just return from injury victorious. Pick: Charlotte Flair wins the Royal Rumble -- Mahjouri"", ""Undisputed WWE Championship -- Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Kevin Owens (Ladder Match): I hope Owens pulls off the upset. It's a compelling twist in the story, plus it'd be rough to see Owens lose in three consecutive undisputed WWE title matches. WWE is committed to Rhodes as champion. While I don't think it'd hurt him to lose and reclaim the title between now and WrestleMania, I suspect WWE takes the safe route by keeping the title on him. Pick: Cody Rhodes retains the title -- Mahjouri"", ""Since it doesn't really matter to be right or wrong when predicting wrestling matches -- and if you're betting on scripted entertainment you're braver than I am -- I was going to pick this one with my heart instead of my head. WWE has only dipped into the title loss before quickly regaining the title once with major titles recently, when Jey Uso won the intercontinental title from Bron Breakker before Breakker won it back less than a month later. It's good to see lengthy title reigns in WWE again, but sometimes there should be a bit more drama via a feeling of unpredictability. From that view, Owens should win on Saturday with Rhodes grabbing the title back ahead of WrestleMania. A ladder match provides enough escape hatches for that loss to come cheaply through outside interference. That said, that approach isn't really how Paul Levesque has booked major titles and Punk's interaction with Rhodes on Monday focused on how the pressure of being champion will continue to wear Rhodes down until he finally breaks at WrestleMania. You don't have that interaction and wipe that story away less than a week later. Pick: Cody Rhodes retains the title -- Brookhouse"", ""WWE Tag Team Championship -- #DIY (c) vs. Motor City Machine Guns (Two-Out-Of-Three Falls Match): It's too soon to take the titles off #DIY. Kudos to WWE for giving two world-class tag teams ample time to show what they can do. Expect the Motor City Machine Guns to look strong but drop the last fall by nefarious means. Pick: #DIY retain the titles -- Mahjouri"", ""I agree with the logic that WWE won't rip the titles away from #DIY this soon but I am very excited to see what these two teams can do in a two-out-of-three falls set-up. Pretty Deadly likely gets involved to tilt things in the champions' favor in the third fall. Regardless of if the outcome feels predictable, this is going to be a tremendous match between two accomplished tag teams. Pick: #DIY retain the titles -- Brookhouse"", '¬© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

There was some controversy with arguments made that Penta‚Äôs feet hit the floor in the opening minutes. That wouldn‚Äôt matter as he was eliminated by Finn Balor after an impressive 42 minutes. When Akira Tozawa couldn‚Äôt compete, viral YouTuber  Speed (I Show Speed) took the number 8 spot. It didn‚Äôt take long before Bron Breakker tore him in half with a spear and sent him over the top rope with a gorilla press slam. Otis caught him only to dump him over his head like a sack of potatoes. Ouch. ', 'The mood of the match changed once the ‚ÄúSamoan Werewolf‚Äù Jacob Fatu entered the mix and conducted a series of eliminations. TNA Champion Joe Hendry got the crowd on its feet by entering event. A product of the working relationship between TNA and WWE. The hits kept coming with Roman Reigns entering at number 16. He quickly took out The Miz, Sheamus, Breakker, and Henry. The stadium erupted when the ‚ÄúTribal Chief‚Äù stood face-to-face with Fatu in a Bloodline standoff. Another Reigns enemy Drew McIntyre entered next., which led to a double team. ', 'The star power grew even more with the final entries including the return of AJ Styles at number 21. John Cena started his farewell tour at number 23, eliminating Braun Strowman and Balor. Not to be outdone, CM Punk and Seth Rollins added to the stacked group at 24 and 25. Logan Paul was the final entrant of the match and played a little floor is lava with the elements around the ring. From there, the herd thinned out when Punk took an opportunity to dump Rollins and Reigns out. Paul surprisingly took out Punk. Rollins snapped going after Punk and Reigns at ringside. This left Jey Uso, Cena, and Paul as the final three. Cena managed to take out Paul, meaning all that was left for him was the king of Yeet. The crowd was divided with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Cena‚Äù and ‚ÄúCena Sucks‚Äù chants like the old days. Cena performed his trademark moves until Jey hit him with a superkick and attempted to toss him over. Cena and Jey both found themselves on the ring apron at one point working to hang on and building up to a suspenseful finish. Jey pulled off one of the biggest upsets of all time by eliminating Cena.

Flair knocked off Jax and Perez to win the match. The Queen has her sights next on reclaiming her throne.', 'WWE', 'Things were personal between former friends Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens. Hence the ladder match stipulation with the Undisputed WWE Championship hanging in the balance.

They didn‚Äôt hold back as they used the unforgiving ladder as a weapon and fought through the crowd to give it that bar-fight vibe.

Owens choked Rhodes with a piece of the ladder, beating him down in hopes WWE‚Äôs quarterback would stay down. Both threw everything at each other to the point physicians and officials were checking to see if he could continue. Sami Zayn, who was friends with the champion and challenger, came out to check on the combatants. Rhodes and Owens continued the battle. Rhodes was able to keep Owens down with a spinebuster through a ladder to retrieve the gold and retain. However, it was revealed that Rhodes incurred some injuries, so we‚Äôll have to see what this means for his ‚Äúfinish the story‚Äù title reign.

Still young in her career, Stratton has been viewed as the next possible multi-time champion given her natural talent and ability to do just about anything in the ring.

WWE Royal Rumble 2025: 3 Things We Hated And 3 Things We Loved,https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1777898/wwe-royal-rumble-2025-3-things-we-hated-3-things-we-loved/,"['', ""Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s annual review of WWE Royal Rumble, the show that always ends with someone pointing at the WrestleMania sign ‚Äî and it's not always the person we expect! Yes, the WINC staff are here to discuss Jey Uso winning the men's Royal Rumble match, as well as numerous other things ‚Äî though when the Rumble comes around, there are way too many individual things for us to cover here. We'll definitely talk both Royal Rumble matches, both in broad strokes and in specific ones, as well as the WWE Tag Team Championship match and the WWE Undisputed Championship match. Our bases are covered ‚Äî we just might not get to Joe Hendry showing up or IShowSpeed eating a Spear."", ""As always, if you need your Rumble coverage more comprehensive and less opinionated, you're going to want to navigate away from here and go check out our Rumble results page. If you want to know what we here at Wresting Inc. thought of the show, however, stay right where you are. These are three things we hated and three things we loved about WWE Royal Rumble 2025."", '', 'While the Women\'s Royal Rumble was controversial (woo!), one woman bested all the odds to become a shocking runner-up. Former two-time ""NXT"" Women\'s Champion and ""NXT"" mainstay Roxanne Perez entered the Royal Rumble at the number three spot, and outlasted 28 women to break current rival Bayley\'s record as the woman to conduct the longest performance in a Royal Rumble match, with Perez\'s official time clocking in at one hour and seven minutes.', 'Perez has been at the top of ""NXT"" for a long time. After coming over to WWE from Ring of Honor, ""The Prodigy"" has proved that she is exactly who she says she is: a prodigy. Perez boasts two ""NXT"" Women\'s Championship reigns, one ""NXT"" Women\'s Tag Team Championship reign alongside Cora Jade, and a whole catalogue of acclaimed premium live event matches, all at the tender age of twenty three. Perez has proven time and time again that she is the girl to beat in ""NXT,"" but even when she is as good as she is, you can\'t help but wonder if she is a big fish in a small pond.', ""Perez's previous Royal Rumble appearances have been cute, but her performance in Saturday's Rumble match was phenomenal. Not only was she able to keep up with former champions IYO SKY (who many consider to be one of the best wrestlers in the world) and Liv Morgan (someone who has improved immensely to stay at the top of WWE's female roster) at the beginning of the match, but she was able to partake in a comedic beat alongside Chelsea Green, when Green grabbed a fistful of Perez' hair to use her as a human weapon. Perez has proven she can hang with the upper echelon of WWE's both serious and comedic performers, even in her young age. Sure, there were times that Perez was absent from the fight, or when she was at the receiving end of offense. Nobody ever truly dominates any multiperson match from start to finish; much less a Rumble. So, when she was on screen, Perez showed out."", 'What I was most impressed with was her ability to bridge the gap between Charlotte Flair and Nia Jax\'s in-ring abilities. Perez was, shockingly, one of the final three women left in the Royal Rumble after Jax eliminated entrant thirty and surprise return Nikki Bella. While Jax has improved immensely, she doesn\'t have the in-ring chops that Flair admittedly does. Perez was a good bridge between Jax\'s up-and-coming skills and Flair\'s years of experience. Flair is nearly twice Perez\'s age, and ""The Queen"" has four years of in-ring experience on Perez. To even hold a candle to Flair at Perez\'s life stage is incredible, but to be able to keep up with her so well that you are the runner-up to a record-setting two-time Royal Rumble winner is a whole other deal.', ""Is this a love letter to Perez? Yeah. Given what she was able to accomplish in tonight's Rumble, though, she deserves it."", 'Written by Angeline Phu', '', ""Fightful says the producers of the women's Royal Rumble were TJ Wilson, Petey Williams, and Kenny Dykstra, and while I have a certain degree of lingering fondness for all three as ex-performers (some more so than others) it is incumbent upon me to ask that they please never produce a Royal Rumble match again."", 'I had so many problems with this (including just a general irritation at the continued absence of Becky Lynch) but my biggest problem without question was the pacing. I have no idea why, but WWE seemed afraid to eliminate people from this match, no matter who they were. It took forever for anyone to get eliminated at all, and there were long stretches where the ring was just filling up with people. The lack of balance between entrances and eliminations killed off any momentum that threatened to build, and the entire phenomenon culminated in the ridiculous spot toward the end when Nia Jax eliminated an entire group of women at the same time. Which, of course she had to do that ‚Äî people had to be eliminated at some point. Unfortunately, doing it this way made the match drag heavily and resulted in several wrestlers who deserved better ‚Äî most notably Bianca Belair and IYO SKY ‚Äî going out as just another face in the crowd instead of actually getting to start or advance a storyline.', 'The poor structure actually killed a lot of potential storytelling moments, particularly on the back half of the match. The first half was carried by surprise MVPs Chelsea Green, Ivy Nile, and Maxxine Dupri, but once they were all gone, WWE mostly lost interest in anything related to story or character. Alexa Bliss\' big return happened at #21, a time in the Rumble that\'s best used as an intermission period, and partially as a result she proceeded to actually do very little until being eliminated by Liv Morgan. As the second half of the match went on, the biggest moments were generally either nostalgia trips like Trish Stratus and Nikki Bella or storyline advancement storylines for ""NXT."" Very little seemingly happened to set up WrestleMania matches for the main roster. And of course, the match had the predictable winner of all predictable winners in the form of Charlotte Flair, who even got the timing wrong on the spot where she eliminated her final opponent.', ""It saddens me to say it, but not a great showing for the women's Rumble this year. Could definitely have used more Becky Lynch."", 'Written by Miles Schneiderman', '', 'Never have I felt so disappointed in a match before. Never have I felt so cheated.', ""I was really excited for Motor City Machine Guns (MCMG) and #DIY's 2-out-of-3 Falls match for the WWE Tag Team Championships ‚Äî I really was! By the time the dust settled over their tag title bout, however, I couldn't help but feel like I was cheated of a match I should've easily Loved. To be clear, the match itself was fine. It was good, even. What I hated ‚Äî what I perceive to be an absolute waste of the time and talent of everybody involved ‚Äî was the ending."", 'The match was reaching its climax, with both teams holding falls to their name after minutes of fierce combat. This was the tiebreaker, and tensions were high. Johnny Gargano accidentally struck Tomasso Ciampa in the face with a stray kick, and before Ciampa could regain his sensibilities, MCMG had nailed Gargano in the face with an assisted basement dropkick and were setting up for the Skull and Bones. Victory was certain.', ""Their loss came in the form of two hooded figures: one who distracted the referee from counting MCMG's pinfall attempt, and another who struck MCMG with a crutch. This distraction allowed for #DIY to Meet in the Middle for a pinfall victory, and while I don't think I would've been mad about a #DIY retention otherwise, the fact that the freaking Street Profits were the ones to help them get the victory infuriated me."", 'Didn\'t #DIY attack the Street Profits and sideline them however long ago? They sure did, and Michael Cole had to give an explanation that was nothing less than verbal gymnastics in order to justify the Profits\' ""assist"" to #DIY. Then, the Profits beat down #DIY because they still hate them, and ‚Äî I\'m utterly exasperated. When you have to explain to me that the Profits helped #DIY retain because they wanted to beat Gargano and Ciampa specifically for the titles, you\'ve already lost me.', ""Sure, as revengers in this maniacal spectacle we call professional wrestling, it makes sense that the Profits would want to rob #DIY of the objects they consolidate their power in: the titles. However, I'm just so incensed that it had to come at the cost of MCMG. It feels unfair to Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin to use such a cheap finish for such a sophisticated wrestling match in such a personal feud (a feud, mind you, that also positions Shelley and Sabin as revengers)."", ""How do you expect me to get behind the Profits when they ruined a perfectly good match? If this finish wasn't for the Profits, how do you expect me to get behind #DIY as victors? If this finish wasn't for #DIY, how do you expect me to take the idea of an MCMG rematch seriously? Nothing here works out for anybody."", ""Just as I've been cheated out of a satisfying match, so too have these men been cheated out of a compelling finish and storyline."", 'Written by Angeline Phu', '', ""Sami Zayn was a dark horse going into the Royal Rumble following the past few weeks after Kevin Owens floated the idea that they could main event WrestleMania against one another for the WWE Championship. For that to be the case, though, Owens said that Zayn would have to ensure he won the title from Cody Rhodes in their ladder match, and in return he would have his back for the Rumble match. Zayn would emerge during the ladder match but only after a fisherman buster off the top rope and onto a ladder, taking both Owens and Rhodes out of action for a spell. He rushed to check on both of his friends, and if he was going to pick a side then would have been the time. But he hesitated, he refused to do so, and Rhodes eventually fought to a victory emphasized by a fallaway slam from the announcer's desk and through another ladder bridged between it and the ring apron."", 'Owens sold the move to perfection, staying stood on his head until well after the match concluded like a lifeless cadaver killed by his opponent, and Zayn\'s guttural scream of concern for Owens when the move was hit immediately hammered home that his inaction had cost his best friend ‚Äì and perhaps their entire friendship ‚Äì dearly. Later on in the Rumble match, it could be argued that it ultimately cost Zayn too, as Owens was unable even if he wanted to come out, and he was eventually eliminated by eventual winner Jey Uso. Now that leaves a set of compelling questions for the ""Underdog from the Underground"" heading into WrestleMania season: Where does he stand with Owens after failing to do what was asked of him, once again elevating his allegiances to others above that to his best friend? Where does he stand with Uso after the, inadvertent or not, elimination on his way to victory? Zayn and Uso have formed a brotherly bond throughout their time as part of the Original Bloodline and then standing against the group, but wrestling has proven historically that certain things tend to change relationships, namely getting kicked in the face even by accident. And that\'s without even considering the arcs of Owens and of course, Rhodes, coming out of the bout. Having a set of interconnected plot lines dotted across the card made for great viewing, and left the right sort of questions to ask about where the story goes from here.', 'Written by Max Everett', '', ""Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled Jey Uso won the Royal Rumble. I think he deserves it, I really didn't want Cena to win, and it made a lot of very online wrestling fans mad, which is never a bad thing. That said, I have to admit it leaves me feeling just a little bit hollow."", 'For months now, a slow drama has been unfolding across WWE programming, flowing out from years of Roman Reigns dominance and Bloodline interference and choices consistent with character and actions having consequences. It involves Reigns, and Drew McIntyre, and Seth Rollins, and Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn, and CM Punk, and Cody Rhodes. And I won\'t say it doesn\'t involve Jey Uso, but .... It doesn\'t really involve Jey Uso. Jey has been out here dealing with GUNTHER and now it looks like he might be dealing with GUNTHER some more. He joined Reigns\' team at WarGames and got some grief for it, but then he beat McIntyre on ""Saturday Night\'s Main Event"" and just kind of moved on with his life. For Jey, fighting giant Scotsmen who blame him for past wrongs is so 2023. He\'s busy pushing his singles stardom as far as it can go, which is why this Royal Rumble win is such a massive and timely accomplishment.', 'But it doesn\'t really interact with the slow drama. The slow drama has been revolving around the WWE Undisputed Championship, specifically, and the promise of the Royal Rumble ‚Äî according to the build that happened on TV ‚Äî was that we would find out who would be holding that title at WrestleMania, and who would be challenging for it. Instead, the answer to that question is mostly ""I guess we\'ll have to wait until Elimination Chamber."" And in the meantime, while you had some cool moments like McIntyre finally getting his hands on Reigns and Rollins snapping and destroying Reigns on the outside, there were a lot of other moments that felt like missed opportunities. Punk was eliminated by Logan Paul. McIntyre was eliminated by Damian Priest (and apparently wasn\'t thrilled about how it went down). Even Rhodes\' title defense against Owens, while impressive as a physical performance, didn\'t feature a heel turn or a heel group forming or Randy Orton coming back or anything. Rhodes just won. Zayn was also there. The end.', ""I'm not saying this has all been a waste of time. I can see where a lot of it might be going and I'm sure it will continue to slowly play out and build. It's just a little disappointing to be sold an event on what seemed like the promise of major developments, only to essentially be told to ask again in a month."", 'Written by Miles Schneiderman', '', ""The main event of its namesake event, the men's Royal Rumble match delivered on the annual spectacle it promised with plenty of stars and welcome surprises dotted throughout. Long before the closing stretch even entered the sight, the likes of Joe Hendry and YouTuber IShowSpeed had appeared in the match to give the Indianapolis crowd something of a gleeful release, but with time it very much became the tale of the main event picture."", 'All of Drew McIntyre, Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, John Cena, and CM Punk joined the fray, along with Sami Zayn and Jey Uso, to continue the fallout of The Bloodline\'s four-year reign, the teased gradual descent into heel-dom for Zayn, the rise of ""Main Event"" Uso, the unspoken agreement between Reigns, Punk, and Paul Heyman, McIntyre\'s quest for vengeance, the decade-long story of betrayal between Reigns and Rollins, and of course Cena\'s very last Rumble match. All had credible reasons to win the Rumble, and all would see their trajectories drastically altered should they not. But only one could win, and the herd started to thin with logic and care applied to those arcs coming out of it.', 'Granted, at the time of writing it doesn\'t seem like McIntyre\'s ending had been by design as he was eliminated by Damian Priest. Reigns and Rollins went at one another with reckless abandon, taking turns trying to eliminate one another in a raw tussle of strength and vitriol. As they were teetering on the ropes, Punk saw his opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, only to then be eliminated himself, leaving all three of the scorned competitors left on the outside staring at one another. Reigns produced one of the funniest soundbites, ""Seriously? We literally teamed up a month ago,"" which is slightly off as it was Survivor Series but nonetheless hilarious and based of the ""Original Tribal Chief."" Then ensued the inevitable brawl between them, with Rollins landing a stomp to Reigns before another one on the ring steps for good measure. All as Heyman watched on in horror. It will be interesting to see how the ""Wise Man"" factors into this, considering he owes Punk a favor, yet Punk was the one that eliminated Reigns and thus enabled him to get stomped, and then there\'s Rollins who aptly wants to burn it all down.', ""Those were layers of storytelling just in the third-quarter of the bout, as when the smoke cleared it would eventually be Uso and Cena left alone in the ring. This writer was feeling nostalgic after watching the '08 Rumble, so I had Cena down as the winner of this, so you can imagine the welcome surprise that came with Uso winning the match. Not only taking us a step closer to Uso finally getting his crowning moment, but also ‚Äî if the post-show is anything to go off ‚Äî set the wheels in motion for Cena's arc for his final year in wrestling."", 'Written by Max Everett']"

The night was headlined by the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs Royal Rumble matches. Each had 30 entrants, and only one emerged. On the women's side, a former winner won for the second time, and in the stacked men's side, an underdog came through for a shocking victory."", 'The WWE Tag Team Championships were on the card in a two-out-of-three falls match, and that match ended with the return of another pairing. Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens took their heated rivalry into another Undisputed WWE Championship bout, and it ended in brutal fashion.', 'WrestleMania 41 is more than 75 days away, but the extravagant event is about to take shape. Check out the highlights and analysis from Royal Rumble 2025:', 'At WrestleMania 41, it will indeed be ""Main Event"" Jey Uso in the limelight. The ""master of yeet"" will be headlining WrestleMania 41 after he outlasted one of the most stacked men‚Äôs Royal Rumble cards of all time to cement his spot at WWE\'s premier event.', ""There were plenty of big names in the match and a case could've been made for any of them. However, in the end it was Uso and John Cena as the final two stars left. They each traded blows, with Uso's super kicks and Cena's Five-Knuckle Shuffle. The two stars went over the ropes on the edge of the ring, and Cena looked like he would win his third Royal Rumble when he got the Attitude Adjustment set up. However, Uso jumped off and back in the ring and pushed Cena out. Cena was just as shocked as the entire WWE world, and he went back in to congratulate the winner."", ""Analysis: What an upset. In the lead-up to the Royal Rumble, people were arguing which former champion would be the one headed to WrestleMania. No one thought it would be Uso, and that's why you must always expect the unexpected. A surprise win will make the build-up to WrestleMania rather interesting, for Uso and other stars who easily could've been the victor, as plenty of big matches are on the horizon in the coming months."", 'Another development to watch from people that didn‚Äôt win was the brawl between Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and CM Punk. Rollins clearly lost his self control with a vicious assault on Reigns that included two curb stomps on the ‚ÄúTribal Chief‚Äù and his continued attack on Punk. In addition, Punk was clearly frustrated with the ‚ÄúWiseman‚Äù Paul Heyman, considering he owes Punk a favor. A storyline may be brewing between all parties and headed toward a match at WrestleMania.', ""All entrants for the men's Royal Rumble match are listed below, as well as when/if they were eliminated."", 'Eliminated by John Cena.', 'Eliminated by AJ Styles.', 'Eliminated by LA Knight.', 'Eliminated by Jey Uso.', 'Eliminated by Damian Priest.', 'Eliminated by CM Punk.', 'Eliminated by Logan Paul.', 'Eliminated by Jey Uso.', 'Eliminated by John Cena.', 'Styles makes his first appearance since October.

Rhodes loves taking the action into the crowd, and he lured Owens into the spectators to give fans a front-row seat to the devastation.', 'The action eventually found its way back around the ring, and Rhodes quickly stopped an attempt by Owens to climb the ladder. Owens later brought out a mini-ladder ‚àí made famous by Hornswoggle ‚àí and it quickly became the weapon both stars used. Later, Rhodes was about to grab the titles when Owens pushed him off and he was left dangling on the hook. He found his way back to the ladder, but was unable to grab the championships. Owens later tried the Ruthless Package Piledriver on the ladder, and Rhodes countered it to send the challenger into the steel. The favor was returned when Owens did a powerbomb to send Rhodes forcefully into a ladder.', ""Owens sent Rhodes off the top rope and into the ladder in the craziest spot of the match. Officials came ringside to check on both stars, who were clearly damaged, and Sami Zayn then came out. The two stars eventually got up, and Rhodes executed a Cross Rhodes. The champion suddenly felt rage and busted Owens' face open. The two met at the announcer's table, and Owens tried the piledriver again, but Rhodes turned it around sent Owens through the ladder, breaking it in the process. With Owens down, Rhodes climbed the ladder and claimed both championships to retain."", 'Analysis: What a brutal one that was. The feud was boiling between Rhodes and Owens, and yet they even took it up another notch in a ladder match where nothing went to waste. It was easy to see Rhodes winning, but it was how he did it that was the shock of it all. Fed up, he ditched the ""good guy"" persona and did all he had to do to retain his championship. Sending Owens through the ladder, when he was already covered in his blood, sent a strong message that Rhodes can be just as sinister as anyone else. It seems like something to remember as WrestleMania 41 approaches.', 'With another successful title defense, it\'s likely Rhodes finally has Owens in his rear-view mirror and he now awaits to see what happens in the men\'s Royal Rumble. WrestleMania 41 will definitely feature ""The American Nightmare"" in the main event.', ""Part one of the tag team title match showcased why #DIY is among the best duos in WWE. Gargano and Ciampa executed the perfect fake tag that had Shelley thinking Gargano was the legal person in. However, Gargano didn't tag in, allowing Ciampa to catch the challenger off guard. Ciampa got a high knee on Shelley and secured the first pin to get the advantage for the champions."", 'Momentum was high for Ciampa and Gargano in the second round. They continued to beat up on a fatigued Shelley. #DIY used tricks again to distract the referee from seeing Shelley tag Sabin in. The referee forced Shelley back in the match and the assault continued on him. Shelley recovered from a deep hole, thanks to Sabin finally getting in the fold. The challengers got Ciampa out of the picture and teed off on Gargano, getting their own pinfall to send the match to a decisive third round.', 'With one pinfall needed, all four competitors tried to get the upper hand, going off on each other. Ciampa got Sabin on his own with a drop knee maneuver, but the pin attempt was unsuccessful. The Motor City Machine Guns then thought they had the victory in their hands, only for Gargano to break the pin attempt at the last second. Gargano went for a kick on Shelley, but it went haywire when he accidentally kicked Ciampa. Gargano looked to be done when two people in hoodies appeared and distracted the referee. It turned out to be the Street Profits, and Angelo Dawkins used a crutch to hit Shelley. It was the turning point and the champions got the second pin to retain. Their reward? A beatdown from the Street Profits.', ""Analysis: The Street Profits are back and are hunting for blood. It's been a few months since they've been seen, but they made an emphatic return with their eyes set on claiming more tag team gold."", 'Aside from the teams participating in the title match, the tag team picture had gotten a bit stale with #DIY and the MCMG the only viable champions. The return of the Street Profits adds a much-needed new player to the mix, and it looks nothing like the duo fans have loved for years. The heel turn could mean the Street Profits are on a warpath for success, and new champions could be coming in the next few months.', 'In a stacked field, it\'s the ""Queen"" that comes out on top.', ""Charlotte hasn't been in action since December 2023, and not only did she make her return, she solidified her spot at WrestleMania 41 by winning the women's Royal Rumble."", ""She entered at No. 27 and although she didn't make many eliminations, she made the ones that mattered. The final three was Charlotte, powerhouse Nia Jax and NXT sensation Roxanne Perez. Perez and Charlotte worked together to get Jax out, setting up a final two of young star vs. decorated veteran. However, Perez was at a disadvantage by being outside of the ropes. Charlotte just needed to land a nasty kick to the head and Perez went out, giving Charlotte the win."", ""She's the first two-time women's winner."", 'Other notable moments included the returns of Alexa Bliss and Nikki Bella, and Jordynne Grace made her first appearance as part of the WWE roster after leaving TNA.', ""Analysis: It seemed too predictable, and maybe that's why it was somewhat of a shock. Charlotte has always been a main event name, yet it seemed like it would be too much of a rush to thrust her into the WrestleMania spot after missing more than a year. Yet she adds another notch in her family's wrestling legacy. It may not be the popular move and is another instance of Charlotte passing by other stars, but her name will certainly be a headliner at WrestleMania 41."", 'Aside from the winner, Perez put up an incredible performance. She is destined to be on the main roster at any moment. She came in at No. 3 and capitalized on her opportunity to shine, setting a women\'s record for time in the Royal Rumble. She may not have won, but finishing as the runner-up shows signs she is a main roster champion in the near future, and 2025 could be a big one for ""The Prodigy.""', ""All entrants for the women's Royal Rumble match are listed, as well as who eliminated them."", 'The WWE Hall of Famer returns.
