For neighbors Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson, the difference in insurance coverage on their nearly identical homes in Altadena reveals how unequal that recovery will be. Hamlin was privately insured and has already been paid out nearly a million dollars. She is searching for contractors to rebuild her house. Wilson will receive just a fraction of what he needs because he was covered by the state’s bare-bones insurance program, the FAIR Plan. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.', 'Next-door neighbors lost their near-identical homes in a California wildfire, but how they are navigating rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, a stark reflection of the nation’s growing home insurance crisis. Louise Hamlin’s house in Altadena was privately insured, while Chris Wilson was forced onto the state’s bare-bones insurance program that critics dub “The Unfair Plan.” Hamlin’s insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors to rebuild. Wilson meanwhile faces the prospect of loans, lawsuits and might even leave California. They’re among thousands of people who lost everything in the Eaton and Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.', ""It’s one thing to fix your home after something basic has gone wrong, but it’s a different beast to rebuild and recover after a major natural disaster has destroyed multiple properties on your street, in your neighborhood or across the region. Don’t wait until you’re in crisis mode to figure out what to expect. Familiarize yourself with your home insurance benefits and rights before anything goes wrong. What kind of coverage do you have? Is it “actual cash value” or “replacement cost value” coverage? You may be entitled to advanced payments soon after trouble strikes. And don't forget to think about how long you'll be displaced as you rebuild."", 'The Aga Khan, spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims and a philanthropist, dies at 88', ""Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, has died. He was 100. Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group who were the nation's first military pilots. Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945.  He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949. The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his passing. The organization said he passed peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan on Sunday."", ""Trump won't rule out deploying US troops to support rebuilding Gaza, sees 'long-term' US ownership"", ""President Donald Trump’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion programs is leading to pushback from Baltimore's mayor. Brandon Scott was the subject of racist attacks online last year after a major bridge collapsed near his city. Online commenters labeled Scott, who is Black, a “DEI mayor” and suggested his race was linked to the fatal accident. Scott saw the attacks on him as part of a broader backlash against Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups in leadership."", 'Iran’s government seems to be welcoming decisions by the United States — even though they happen to come from a man Iranian operatives have allegedly been plotting to assassinate. President Donald Trump’s moves to freeze spending on foreign aid and overhaul, maybe even end, the U.S. Agency for International Development have been lauded in Iranian state media. The reports say the decisions will halt funding for opponents of the country’s Shiite theocracy — pro-democracy activists and others supported through USAID programs as part of U.S. government’s efforts to help democracy worldwide. Iranian officials also seem to be signaling they are waiting for a message from Trump on whether he wants to negotiate over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.', 'In Florida, it’s still DeSantis vs. Trump. Once hailed as a potential heir to Donald Trump — and widely expected to have presidential aspirations in 2028 — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is coming out of the gate with an offensive to regain trust from a base loyal to the Republican leader that DeSantis dared to challenge by latching on to his main cause — immigration. But the popular governor who tussled with Trump for the GOP presidential nomination is facing a high-stakes battle within his own party over how to best carry out the president’s immigration agenda.', ""Trump won't rule out deploying US troops to support rebuilding Gaza, sees 'long-term' US ownership"", ""An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time. Colin MacKnight is spending this year playing nearly 18 hours of Bach's organ works in 30-minute increments during free weekly concerts at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral near downtown Little Rock. The performances are among countless other events around the world this year to commemorate Bach's legacy. MacKnight has been playing Bach since he was a teen. His concerts are drawing dozens of people each week, including newcomers who want a peaceful break."", 'When Ukrainian soldiers captured two North Korean prisoners of war last month, it provided the first undeniable proof of Pyongyang’s direct involvement in the war against Ukraine. It also shed some light on the mindset of the conscripted North Korean soldiers sent to fight Russia’s war a continent away from their home. Highly disciplined, ready to die but also with little battlefield experience they elicited curiosity and even some pity from the Ukrainian soldiers who captured them during two missions on Jan. 9. Their capture confirmed what Ukraine, South Korea and the U.S. have said for months: Thousands of North Korean troops are fighting alongside Kremlin forces in the battle for Russia’s Kursk border region — something Moscow has never confirmed.', ""President Donald Trump is signing an executive order designed to prevent people who were biologically assigned male at birth from participating in women’s or girls' sporting events. Wednesday's order, which Trump is expected to sign at an afternoon ceremony, marks another aggressive shift by the president’s second administration in the way the federal government deals with transgender people and their rights. The president put out a sweeping order on his first day in office last month that called for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and in policies such as federal prison assignments."", 'President Donald Trump offered a jaw-dropping performance during his joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting that Palestinian refugees from the Gaza Strip could be permanently resettled elsewhere. He suggested on Tuesday that the U.S. could stage a long-term takeover of the vacated region, even leading redevelopment efforts to make it a seaside paradise in waiting. He also refused to rule out sending U.S. troops in to seal the deal and said he himself — ever the real estate developer — might pay a personal visit. The suggestions will be non-starters for Hamas, though. And they could jeopardize the continuation of a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages the group is still holding.', ""A prison in Syria holds about 4,500 members of the Islamic State group who have been there for years without trial. The Associated Press was given an exclusive access to visit the prison, nearly two months after the fall of the 54-year Assad dynasty in Syria. The detainees might not even know about the recent events in the country as prison officials try to limit outside information. Syria's upheaval has led to new attention, and new pressures, on such detention centers. There are fears that IS members who seized the weapons of ousted President Bashar Assad's retreating forces will try to attack and free their comrades."", 'When it comes to what we eat, it’s not just a matter of taste. What food and drink look like, the colors we see, have mattered to people for millennia. And nowhere has that been more clear than the American food palate, where the visual spectrum includes not only the primary colors but artificial ones that nature couldn’t even dream up. Over the decades, there’s been pushback and government regulation over just HOW food and drink have been colored, most recently with the decision last week from the federal Food and Drug Administration to ban red dye No. 3 from foods and oral-ingested drugs because of concerns over a possible cancer risk.', ""Led by Ian Martinez's 19 points, the Utah State Aggies defeated the Wyoming Cowboys 71-67 on Tuesday night. The Aggies are now 20-3 on the season, while the Cowboys fell to 11-12."", 'Gaza has long been a powder keg, and it exploded after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and began killing and abducting people, sparking a crushing Israeli military operation there that’s only recently reached an uneasy ceasefire. President Donald Trump’s suggestion Tuesday that that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take “ownership” may spark new tension over the enclave against the Mediterranean Sea.', 'Nick Martinelli scored 27 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and his basket with 2.6 seconds left helped Northwestern avoid disaster holding off USC for a  77-75 win. On the game-winner, Martinelli split a double team near the baseline and softly laid it in to give Northwestern the lead. Out of a timeout, USC put the ball in the hands of Clark Slajchert who took a few dribbles before a Wildcats defender knocked it out of bounds and time expired. Slajchert scored 24 points shooting 9 for 11.', ""LOS ANGELES — Ryan Brasier's time with the Dodgers officially ended on Tuesday, with the veteran reliever being traded to the Chicago Cubs less than a week after being designated for assignment."", 'Johni Broome and Chad Baker-Mazara scored 15 points each and No. 1 Auburn remained undefeated in Southeastern Conference play with a 98-70 win over Oklahoma.

There were speeches. And there was Manilow, still trim and impeccably coiffed at 81, performing his classic “Mandy” as video screens cut between today and clips from an appearance he and Davis made on “The Midnight Special” in 1975.', '“Can you believe Clive looked like that?” Manilow asked the crowd of the debonair record executive who helped shepherd him to stardom. “Can you believe I looked like that?”', 'Held at the Beverly Hilton ahead of Sunday’s 67th Grammys ceremony, Davis’ invite-only party drew a characteristically high-wattage crowd — guests included Jennifer Lopez, Gladys Knight, Alicia Keys, Berry Gordy, Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds, Jack Antonoff and Davis’ old pal Nancy Pelosi — for an evening of music and tactical hobnobbing that Jimmy Kimmel likened to “Clive Davis’ bar mitzvah.”', 'Among the acts who performed at that inaugural get-together, Kimmel joked as he introduced Davis: “Moses with the Bay City Rollers backing him up.”', 'Yet in the wake of last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, Davis said he’d remade Saturday’s gala as a fundraiser for MusiCares, the Recording Academy’s philanthropic arm; he himself had made a “six-figure donation,” he said, urging the deep-pocketed in the house to contribute what they could to provide relief to music professionals in need.', 'The night’s entertainment opened with a rock ’n’ roll supergroup — brothers Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, producer Andrew Watt and Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers — cranking through a medley of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath covers before Michael Bublé took over to pay tribute to the late Quincy Jones with a swinging rendition of “Fly Me to the Moon.”', 'Four of the Grammys’ eight best new artist nominees performed: Doechii, theater-kid exuberant in “Denial Is a River”; Teddy Swims, who growled his “Lose Control” wearing a bedazzled white suit; Shaboozey, beginning to tire a bit, perhaps, of his inescapable “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”; and mustachioed Benson Boone, new-rock-god resplendent in a leathery jumpsuit as he laid into the high notes of “Beautiful Things.”', 'Jazz singer Samara Joy, who won best new artist at the Grammys in 2023, did Betty Carter’s “Tight,” while gospel star Yolanda Adams channeled Whitney Houston in a solemn but flowery take on “I Will Always Love You.” (Davis, who signed Houston to his Arista label, almost always takes a moment at his party to remember the singer, who died at the Beverly Hilton in 2012 just hours before the event was set to begin.) Post Malone was there, too: He sang the wistful “Sunflower” — “my only good song,” per his description — in recognition of Universal Music Publishing Group Chief Executive Jody Gerson, who was presented with the Recording Academy’s Industry Icon award.', 'The high point, as it often is these days, was Joni Mitchell, a longtime Davis confidant, who sat onstage in a glittering throne — blond hair tucked beneath a beret, mischievous eyes hidden behind a pair of shades — and sang “Both Sides Now” and George Gershwin’s “Summertime” with a richness of tone that brought a room full of chatter and gossip to something pretty close to silence.', 'Get notified when the biggest stories in Hollywood, culture and entertainment go live.

The A-listers who made the cut this year included Jennifer Lopez, Babyface, Gayle King, Nancy Pelosi, Jack Antonoff, TEMS, Willow Smith, Berry Gordy, Paris Hilton, Alicia Keys, Swizz Beatz, Diane Warren, Gracie Abrams, John Stamos and Justin Tranter.', 'Who wouldn\'t want a ticket to “Clive Davis\' bar mitzvah,"" comedian Jimmy Kimmel asked before announcing the man of the hour.', '“He\'s a living legend,"" Kimmel said.', ""Considering Davis' singular influence in the music industry through his work with Houston, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few, it was no wonder so many were excited to attend.

It was a big opening for the Universal Pictures release adapted from the graphic novel series by author Dav Pilkey. The big-screen launch for the cartoon canine was produced for a modest $40 million, meaning it will easily coast through a profitable run. Family movies like “Moana 2” and “Inside Out 2” last year buoyed the box office. So far, they’re lifting 2025, too.

"Inside Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Fundraiser: Post Malone, Joni Mitchell, Yolanda Adams & More Powerful Performances",https://www.billboard.com/lists/clive-davis-pre-grammy-fundraiser-post-malone-joni-mitchell-recap/,"['Plus, Jody Gerson accepted the Industry Icon award.', 'By Lyndsey Havens', 'The 2025 edition of Clive Davis’ annual Pre-Grammy Gala had special meaning this year. Not only had the cherished event transitioned into a fundraiser – with a suggested minimum donation of $500 per person to MusiCares’ Fire Relief Fund – but it was also billed as its 50th year.', '“This year marks the 50th anniversary of this incredible night, but this one is a little different,” said Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, which co-hosts the event. And while he acknowledged that many questioned whether or not the Grammys should take place this year given Los Angeles’ very recent and historic wildfires, he revealed why they ultimately decided to move forward. “It was not an easy decision, but we know we could raise awareness and celebrate resiliency.” ', 'He added that almost $500 million dollars of aid had already been raised and distributed by MusiCares, with Davis noting that he had personally made a six-figure donation to the cause – which someone had matched just as tonight’s event kicked off. ', 'Jimmy Kimmel spoke next, joking that everyone had gathered for “Clive Davis’ Bar Mitzvah.” Yet what followed was a beautiful blend of first-person storytelling from Clive’s legendary career – from memories with Quincy Jones and Whitney Houston to a painting Joni Mitchell gifted him earlier – as well as superstar performances from legendary rockers and vocalists, current chart-toppers and a handful of best new artist nominees. Clive also made a point of shouting out just some of the night’s many noteworthy attendees, including Berry Gordy, Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, Gladys Knight, Jack Antonoff and Nancy Pelosi. Plus, of course, there was the annual Industry Icon award, this year presented to Jody Gerson, CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group. ', 'And when all was said and done, the evening accomplished exactly what it set out to do: celebrate the past and present while helping rebuild for the future. As Davis so succinctly said after the evening’s final performance: “Thank you.”', 'Below are the highlights from the star-studded event.', 'To get things going, a legendary lineup of rockers joined forces including the Black Crowes’ Chris and Rich Robinson, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, hitmaker Andrew Watt on guitar and Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer Chad Smith. Fittingly, the group ended its three-song set with Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” – a message echoed throughout the night.', 'While teasing the night’s next performance, Clive – who remained seated on stage throughout the evening – said this artist would “honor the legacy of the greatest of the greats: Quincy Jones… As a producer, he possessed one of the most important and powerful voices, influencing the sound of popular music for more than 50 years.” Davis then welcomed Michael Bublé to the stage, who performed his own recorded rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon,” off Sinatra’s 1964 album, It Might as Well Be Swing, for which Jones arranged the music. “That dude can cook, huh?” said Bublé of Jones. “A chef knows what he’s cooking, but more [importantly] who he’s cooking for.”', 'Davis had some help from his younger self to introduce the next performer of the night. Footage from 1975 (played on the large screens bookending the stage) showed the then-40-something-year-old introducing his new signee at the time: Barry Manilow. The then-30-something-year-old Manilow was shown performing his smash hit “Mandy,” which the singer then finished himself on stage. After, he asked the room: “Can you believe Clive looked like that? Can you believe I looked like that?” ', 'Following a feel-good performance from Post Malone who sang “Sunflower,” which he called “my only good song,” Sir Lucian Grainge introduced the 2025 Industry Icon, Jody Gerson – but not before acknowledging the tragedy Los Angeles has just endured. “The wildfires this past month have inflicted enormous levels of suffering and loss upon way too many people, including many of our colleagues and artists and songwriters.  Let’s take this moment to remind ourselves that, as a community, we must remain united in our resolve to help bring relief to those who have been affected…But even as we begin to recover from this tragedy, we must not fail to celebrate those things in life that deserve celebration. They provide the inspiration for the better future we envision and will build together…So, tonight, it is my privilege, and, indeed, it is my great pleasure, to introduce and celebrate Jody Gerson, a true industry icon who rightly deserves celebration.”', 'And after sharing just some of her career highlights across the past three decades — during which she’s championed artists including Adele, Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and more — Gerson herself took to the stage to reflect and rejoice in her many successes, starting with the first time she successfully snuck into this exact party years ago. “When I finally\u202fdid receive my first official invite to attend, it was a big moment in my career,” she recalled.” I remember it well; It was the year Alicia Keys released her debut album, Songs in A Minor,\u202fand, Clive, I was so happy to share in its success with you.” She then shouted out the work she and Keys continue to do together through their foundation, She Is the Music, which increases the number of women working in the music business. ', 'Gerson went on to share that when Harvey Mason Jr. called with the news of her honor, she was “stunned.” She thought back to being a “precocious little girl” who would hang at her father and grandfather’s New Jersey club where everyone from Sinatra to Diana Ross and the Supremes would perform. “I\u202fspent a lot of time at the club, often backstage, watching the artists and musicians before they went on stage. I studied them…I saw how my dad dealt with them. I watched everything, missed nothing, and definitely saw more than I should have.\u202fAfter all, it was the 70s…Even at that young age, I\u202fknew \u202fthat I wanted a career in the music business.”', '“But I want my impact to reach beyond the boundaries of the music business,” she continued, sharing that she recently joined the board of the non-profit Project Healthy Minds, which makes mental health services more easily accessible. She noted that in conjunction with material losses from the wildfires, “there is an unprecedented toll on the mental health of many who live here. We are anxious. Many of us are depressed and traumatized and we feel out of control. What is happening in Los Angeles now is reflective of what is going on in our country as a whole. We have a mental health crisis that\u202fmust be dealt with…But by normalizing the pursuit of mental health care, we should applaud iconic artists like Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Chappell Roan and so many more who have helped to lessen the stigma surrounding mental health care and made it ok for many to seek help for the first time.”', 'Despite all the good Gerson has done for the music community and beyond, she concluded by saying her greatest joy is being a mom. “My mom always said that I\u202fcould have it all, and I do: An incredible career and a wonderful family.” (Her daughter was later heard saying, “I’m so proud of you.”)', 'But before stepping off stage, Gerson brought the focus back to the evening’s main mission: to help a hurting community heal. “Music can brighten even our darkest days, and we surely need artists to bring light into the world,” she said. “Now, more than ever.”', '“I don’t think there’s one person here who expected to see her perform [tonight],” Davis teased of the next performer. “She’s one of the greatest of our time.” He then shared a detail that prompted a hushed “oh” from the crowd,  revealing that she is a painter – and making it clear which icon he was speaking of. “She came [tonight] with a personal gift of a painting that she did maybe two decades ago where she painted Elton John at this party and in the portrait was Richard Perry.” Fortunately, that wasn’t the only gift Mitchell shared, as she treated guests to a two-song set of “Both Sides Now” and “Summertime.”', 'In 2023, jazz vocalist Samara Joy won best new artist – and tonight, she covered the Betty Carter composition “Tight.” And while Joy was the only recent best new artist winner to perform, a handful of hopefuls in the category showed off their skills through their chart-topping hits. Doechii performed in honor of Gerson, delivering her debut solo Hot 100 entry, “Denial Is a River”; Shaboozey amped up the energy with his record-tying Hot 100 No. 1 entry, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”; Teddy Swims stunned with a sweeping performance of “Lose Control”; and Benson Boone delivered his soaring breakout “Beautiful Things.”', '“This was Whitney’s favorite night of the year,” said Clive. Fittingly, he chose to end the night by honoring Houston’s legacy with help from gospel singer Yolanda Adams. “May this song bless you,” she said, before diving into the heart-aching “I Will Always Love You,” which on a night like tonight, carried extra weight and brought the evening full circle by ending with the message instilled from the start: it’s all about the love.', 'Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', '', 'A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', 'Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Joni, a long time fan of the Clive Davis dinner, has never taken the stage herself. She did last night, to a thunderous welcome. Sitting in what I call her Solomon Burke throne, Mitchell delivered a mesmerizing version of her signature hit, “Both Sides Now,” that beat even the one she did on Thursday night at Fire Aid.', 'Joni must have been shocked by the intense, emotional response from the audience because she was only supposed to sing one song. Bolstered by waves of love, she then launched into a rendition of George Gershwin’s “Summertime” from “Porgy and Bess” that rivaled even my favorite version by Billy Stewart — or any of the many great singers who’ve recorded this song. It was sublime, a landmark moment in Clive’s 50 years of showcasing artists.', 'The very appreciative audience included forever Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, plus Barry Manilow — the instigator of this whole party 50 years ago, Motown legends Berry Gordy, the legendary Gladys Knight, and Suzanne DePasse, Frankie Valli, Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, Jennifer Lopez (with manager Benny Medina), Gayle King, Jimmy Kimmel — who functioned as a hilarious co-emcee to Clive, Kenny Babyface Edmonds, Diane Warren, Peter Asher, Ray Parker Jr., Taylor Dane, Sheila E., Jeff Zucker, Paul Shaffer, famed actress Michele Lee, “Laugh In” creator George Schlatter, hit songwriter (“Murder on the Dance Floor”) and New Radicals creator Gregg Alexander, KISS’s Paul Stanley, Ari Melber, Don Lemon, Bill Maher, Kenny G, famed drummer Matt Sorum, singer Estelle, and so on.', 'Manilow, before his own show stopping performance, declared he started with Clive at Arista Records “in 1823.”', 'Mr. Brainwash — aka Thierry Guetta — was front and center after making a portrait of Clive and all his artists.', 'That gives you just a hint of the audience.

The artist and songwriter championed by Gerson urged the crowd to support the first-responders who helped the fire-torn areas and will be essential to rebuilding efforts. “Please take care of those on the front lines kicking ass,” Post Malone said in closing.', 'Gerson’s boss, Universal Music Group Chairman-CEO Lucian Grainge, gave Gerson a lengthy introduction, hailing her as a “fierce advocate” and “industry icon.” Gerson spoke of her long career in the industry, remembering her childhood watching icons like Frank Sinatra perform at her family’s nightclub in Philadelphia, and recalled sneaking into her first Clive party (which must have been easier in those days). But mostly she spoke up for songwriters — who are sadly underpaid in the streaming economy — female artists and executives, and for mental health; she noted that she’s recently joined the board of the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. She said that she long ago decided that she would “Devote my entire career to protecting artists and the value of their work,” she said. She also called out Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and Chappell Roan for speaking out about the importance of addressing mental health issues.', 'No less an legendary figure than Joni Mitchell was on hand to sing her contemporary classic, “Both Sides Now.” She walked out on stage with assistance and performed from a golden throne, aka a yellow stuffed chair, in a performance similar to — but stronger than — the one she’d given at FireAid on Thursday night. Mitchell also delivered a soulful rendition of Gershwin’s “Summertime.”', 'Doechii delivering a spirited version of her song “Denial Is a River,” with the Ricky Minor-led house band giving the song a jazzy flair, and the evening wound to a close with a trifecta of 2025 best new artist nominees performing their signature songs.', 'Shaboozey had the audience on its feet with a rousing take on his 2024-defining hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy).” Teddy Swims showed off his brilliantly powerful voice with “Lose Control,” and Benson Boone, clad in his now-familiar sleeveless jumpsuit, soared through “Beautiful Things” — and in another familiar move, literally soared at the end of the song with a backflip.', 'The evening also featured a series of tributes. Michael Buble sang in honor of the late Quincy Jones; Barry Manilow, the first hit artist on Davis’ Arista Records, sang for producer Richard Perry, who also died last year. The evening closed with Yolanda Adams honoring Whitney Houston, who was perhaps the artist closest to Davis’ heart, and passed away on the day of the Gala in 2011.', 'Yet even more than most years, this 50th anniversary show was a tribute to the man himself. While he’s always stationed in the shadows at the side of the stage with his longtime right-hand Stacy Carr, this year the pair were on the stage for the entire event, which each artist walking over to pay homage and be photographed after their performance.', 'And, as always, the music itself was the tribute to the man. It is safe to say that nowhere else can one witness performances from Post Malone, Barry Manilow, Doechii, Yolanda Adams and all of the above, on an evening that kicked off with a bruising hard rock medley of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath songs by an all-star band featuring Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and superproducer Andrew Watt on lead guitar.', 'Every year, the diversity and versatility of the performers reflect the same qualities in this singular executive’s career.', 'Best of Variety', 'Grammy Predictions, From Beyoncé to Kendrick Lamar: Who Will Win?

There were speeches. And there was Manilow, still trim and impeccably coiffed at 81, performing his classic “Mandy” as video screens cut between today and clips from an appearance he and Davis made on “The Midnight Special” in 1975.', '“Can you believe Clive looked like that?” Manilow asked the crowd of the debonair record executive who helped shepherd him to stardom. “Can you believe I looked like that?”', 'Held at the Beverly Hilton ahead of Sunday’s 67th Grammys ceremony, Davis’ invite-only party drew a characteristically high-wattage crowd — guests included Jennifer Lopez, Gladys Knight, Alicia Keys, Berry Gordy, Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds, Jack Antonoff and Davis’ old pal Nancy Pelosi — for an evening of music and tactical hobnobbing that Jimmy Kimmel likened to “Clive Davis’ bar mitzvah.”', 'Among the acts who performed at that inaugural get-together, Kimmel joked as he introduced Davis: “Moses with the Bay City Rollers backing him up.”', 'Yet in the wake of last month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, Davis said he’d remade Saturday’s gala as a fundraiser for MusiCares, the Recording Academy’s philanthropic arm; he himself had made a “six-figure donation,” he said, urging the deep-pocketed in the house to contribute what they could to provide relief to music professionals in need.', 'The night’s entertainment opened with a rock ’n’ roll supergroup — brothers Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, producer Andrew Watt and Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers — cranking through a medley of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath covers before Michael Bublé took over to pay tribute to the late Quincy Jones with a swinging rendition of “Fly Me to the Moon.”', 'Four of the Grammys’ eight best new artist nominees performed: Doechii, theater-kid exuberant in “Denial Is a River”; Teddy Swims, who growled his “Lose Control” wearing a bedazzled white suit; Shaboozey, beginning to tire a bit, perhaps, of his inescapable “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”; and mustachioed Benson Boone, new-rock-god resplendent in a leathery jumpsuit as he laid into the high notes of “Beautiful Things.”', 'Jazz singer Samara Joy, who won best new artist at the Grammys in 2023, did Betty Carter’s “Tight,” while gospel star Yolanda Adams channeled Whitney Houston in a solemn but flowery take on “I Will Always Love You.” (Davis, who signed Houston to his Arista label, almost always takes a moment at his party to remember the singer, who died at the Beverly Hilton in 2012 just hours before the event was set to begin.) Post Malone was there, too: He sang the wistful “Sunflower” — “my only good song,” per his description — in recognition of Universal Music Publishing Group Chief Executive Jody Gerson, who was presented with the Recording Academy’s Industry Icon award.', 'The high point, as it often is these days, was Joni Mitchell, a longtime Davis confidant, who sat onstage in a glittering throne — blond hair tucked beneath a beret, mischievous eyes hidden behind a pair of shades — and sang “Both Sides Now” and George Gershwin’s “Summertime” with a richness of tone that brought a room full of chatter and gossip to something pretty close to silence.', 'Get notified when the biggest stories in Hollywood, culture and entertainment go live.

As always, Saturday night’s show featured a unique mix at the microphone of legends (Joni Mitchell, Barry Manilow), rising stars (Shaboozey, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims) and rock royalty (members of Black Crowes, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica).', 'But this year’s starry event had a new moniker on the program, billed as an “event” rather than a “gala,” due to the catastrophic Los Angeles blazes that ripped through the city last month. While the wildfires forced a pivot — the typically glamorous affair got scaled back a bit by nixing the red carpet and its crush of press and photographers — and introduced a focus on fundraising via MusiCares, music, as always, remained the start of the show. Saturday night delivered a parade of Grammy winning and nominated performers gracing the stage one after another, bookended by effusive introductions from Davis, who, at 92, skipped his jaunts to the podium in favor of a seated perch at the side of the stage.', '', 'Following an electric opener from a band of rock and roll heavy hitters — Chris and Nick Robinson of the Black Crowes, Andrew Watt, Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rob Trujillo of Metallica (performing two songs including Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs”) — Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. kicked off the program by explaining to the black tie crowd why the event would look “a little different” this year.', '“We’re here in a city recovering from devastating wildfires and we’re facing a long road ahead. When the fires started, there were actually a lot of questions about whether the Grammys should even go on. After consulting with state and city leaders, and many others, we decided to move forward,” detailed Mason, who noted that MusiCares had raised and distributed almost $5 million in aid to the more than 2,500 music professionals impacted by the fires. “It was not an easy decision but we know we could use this platform to raise awareness and support first responders and celebrate the resilience of this community.”', '', 'Host Jimmy Kimmel, joined at the event by wife Molly McNearney, also paid tribute to first responders as well as the industry response. “The entertainment community’s response to this tragedy has been overwhelming,” said Kimmel, fresh from appearing on stage during the star-packed fire relief concert on Thursday night. “FireAid was a great event and raised $60 million and tonight we’re going to raise even more.”', 'Regarding Davis, Kimmel called him a “living legend” who “still has the fire, he’s still competitive.” He added: “A few minutes ago, I heard him backstage that this fundraiser was going to ‘blow Feed the Children out of the fucking water.’”', 'Davis took the spotlight then and proved he’s still got his sense of humor despite the circumstances. “Jimmy, thank you for that great introduction, which was occasionally funny.” On a serious note, Davis said that he’s often found that good “arises from the life spring of pain,” which is why he and the Academy decided to transform the event and keep it on the calendar. Plus, there was a milestone anniversary to toast and coffers to fill which is why Davis led the charge by announcing that he would open his wallet with a six-figure donation.', 'He kept the show moving by welcoming Canadian crooner Michael Bublé to the lights to pay tribute to the late Quincy Jones with a version of the Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon.” It was followed by another tribute, this one via video and in honor of the late Richard Perry, who passed away in December. The clip featured the likes of Rod Stewart, Jane Fonda, David Foster, Diane Warren, Carole Bayer Sager and Ruth Pointer of the Pointer Sisters.', '', 'Other bold-faced names got special shout outs from the stage by Davis, who detailed how the practice became something of “a signature part” of the event’s history. Receiving love, applause and the occasional standing ovation were Berry Gordy, Nancy Pelosi, Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys and husband Swizz Beatz, Gayle King, Jack Antonoff and wife Margaret Qualley, Gladys Knight, Bill Maher, Ari Melber, Chazz Palminteri and more. He saved special praise for Joni Mitchell by announcing that she would perform later in the show and revealing that she arrived with a gift for him: a piece of art she painted nearly two decades ago featuring Elton John.', '“You will be in for a moment of lifetime,” Davis said of Mitchell’s performance that included two songs, “Both Sides Now” and “Summertime.” And it was the moment of the night as Mitchell, clad in a beret and sunglasses, had the ballroom rapt with attention as she delivered her set from a throne-like chair, glowing throughout and looking giddy with a wide smile when both songs finished.', 'Also delivering two songs was Davis’ longtime friend and collaborator Barry Manilow. The legendary crooner, 81, had the distinction of performing at the very first gala 50 years ago, and to prove it, Davis introduced a clip from that very night that featured a the two men in their younger years. “Can you believe I looked like that? Can you believe Clive looked like that?” Manilow asked to laughs from the crowd. Then, he said, “I’m so happy to be here to help Clive raise money for those people in the music community affected by these horrible fires. With all of the great music that Clive’s got planned for you, maybe it would all make us feel a little bit better.”', '', 'He said he’s felt better with Davis by his side all these years at Arista Records. “Although I worked real hard on records that I made, the truth is that Clive was always watching over me, I don’t know how I got so lucky but I am the grateful recipient of this man’s genius.” Manilow received standing ovations for his set that featured “Mandy” and “Once Before I Go.”', 'Other highlights included rising rap star Doechii with “Denial is a River,” Shaboozey with his blockbuster chart topper “Tipsy,” Samara Joy with a cover of Betty Carter’s “Tight,” Benson Boone (in a skintight jumpsuit) with powerful vocals and a show-stopping turn with “Beautiful Things,” and Teddy Swims with a well-received performance of his breakout hit “Lose Control.”', 'Post Malone admitted upon taking the stage that he spilled a screwdriver cocktail on himself before he came out to sing by saying, “I did not piss my pants.” Wet jeans and all, the superstar delivered “Sunflower,” which he called “my only good song,” as a way to honor the night’s sole honoree Jody Gerson, CEO of Universal Music Publishing. She was feted by her boss, Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, who called her a “true industry icon” who rightly deserves a celebration.', '“She’s completely transformed Universal Music Group Publishing into a global powerhouse and the home of the world’s greatest songwriters,” Grainge said, citing such artists as Adele, Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Kendrick Lamar, Prince, Rosalía and many more.', '', 'In accepting, Gerson confessed that “a few times” early in her career, she actually crashed the pre-Grammys gala. “The first time I did it, I got all dressed up, snuck in without being noticed. I was a nervous wreck, but trying to look like I belonged here. When I walked into the party, I bump smacked into Fred Davis, who was very surprised to see me,” she said of Clive’s son. His other son, power lawyer Doug Davis, is key to organizing the gala these days.  Even though my career had barely started at that moment, I was sure it was already over.”', 'But now she’s an icon. “Music can brighten even our darkest days, and we surely need artists to bring light into the world now more than ever. So thank you for everyone who is here tonight for showing up and celebrating all of the Grammy nominees. You are helping us take the first steps in building back a beautiful city, and I’m so very proud to be part of this wonderful community.”', 'Someone who was long part of Davis’ inner circle was Whitney Houston. Davis saved her tribute for the big finale by saying that his gala was Houston’s favorite night of the year. She performed six times over the years, and as such, “the 50th anniversary tonight wouldn’t be complete without a performance to honor one of the greatest voices of all time and someone I hold close to my heart.”', '', 'Davis then welcomed gospel great Yolanda Adams to the stage to close the show with a rendition of Houston’s iconic hit “I Will Always Love You.” Before doing so, Adams said, “As Clive said, [Whitney] would definitely be here not only in presence but in substance as well. She would give from her heart as all of us should. And may this song bless you.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"
