The vast majority cause no injuries and little or no damage, but the country has also seen deadly quakes.', 'Santorini, one of Greece’s most popular tourist destinations, took its present crescent shape following a massive volcanic eruption in antiquity. Now, millions of visitors each year come to see its dramatic scenery of whitewashed houses and blue-domed churches clinging to the caldera rim.', 'Here’s a look at the current situation:', 'Hundreds of quakes with magnitudes between 3 and 4.9 have been registered since Saturday between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos. Although Greece is no stranger to earthquakes, seismic activity of such frequency and intensity without having been preceded by a major quake is unusual, seismologists say.', 'The fault line producing the earthquakes runs for about 120 kilometers (75 miles), but so far only part of it, between the islands of Santorini and Amorgos, has been activated. The epicenters are beneath the seabed, which scientists say is good news, as quakes centered beneath land could potentially be more destructive.', 'But a large quake could also trigger a tsunami, so authorities have warned people to stay away from coastal areas and head inland if they feel a significant earthquake.', 'So far, there has been no significant damage and no injuries, although some minor rock slides have occurred.', 'Although theoretically possible, experts say they don’t expect that.', '“All scientists agree that this is a highly unlikely scenario,” Costas Papazachos, professor of applied geophysics and seismology at the University of Thessaloniki, said Tuesday.', 'Santorini lies along the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which stretches from the Peloponnese in southern Greece through the Cycladic islands. There are two volcanoes in the area: Nea Kameni, an islet within Santorini’s caldera; and Kolumbo, a submarine volcano about 8 kilometers (5 miles) northeast of Santorini.', 'Last week, Greece’s Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry announced that sensors had picked up “mild seismic-volcanic activity” inside the caldera. Similar activity in 2011 lasted for 14 months and ended without any issues.', 'Scientists say the current quakes are unrelated to the volcanic activity.', 'Experts are still trying to determine whether the multiple quakes are foreshocks — smaller earthquakes before a major temblor — or whether they are part of an earthquake swarm of smaller quakes that could continue for weeks or months.', '“There is no serious technology or approach to be able to predict what will happen from here on,” Papazachos said.', 'Seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said that the “possibility is open” that the quakes, which began on Jan. 24 and intensified Saturday, could be followed by a larger temblor.', 'Santorini’s main villages are built along the rim of the volcano’s caldera — producing the dramatic scenery of cascading whitewashed houses and sunset viewpoints that make the island so popular, but also raising concerns in the event of a major earthquake. The sheer cliffs also make some areas prone to rock slides.', 'Authorities sent rescuers with a sniffer dog and drones to Santorini, where they set up tents in a basketball court next to the island’s main hospital as a staging area. Push alerts have been sent to cellphones warning people to stay away from areas where rock slides could occur, and banning access to some coastal areas.', 'Residents and hotels have been asked to drain swimming pools, because the water movement in a major quake could destabilize buildings. People have been told to avoid old buildings and check for exit routes when in built-up areas.', 'Schools on Santorini, as well as the nearby islands of Anafi, Amorgos and Ios, will remain shut all week, while other nearby islands also shut their schools on Tuesday.', 'Greece’s largest quake in the last century occurred in the area — it was a 7.7-magnitude temblor dubbed the Amorgos earthquake that struck in 1956, triggering a roughly 20-meter (65-foot) tsunami, causing significant damage in Amorgos and Santorini and killing more than 50 people.', 'Santorini is also the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history. Known as the Minoan eruption, it occurred around 1,600 B.C. and destroyed much of the formerly round island. The eruption is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization.', 'Although still an active volcano, its last notable eruption occurred in 1950.', '“What we must realize is that the Santorini volcano produces very large explosions every 20,000 years,” Efthymios Lekkas, seismologist and head of the scientific monitoring committee for the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, said last week. “It’s been 3,000 years since the last explosion, so we have a very long time ahead of us before we face a big explosion.”', 'Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

This was the largest quake in Greece in the 20th century, prompting a 30m tsunami and causing the deaths of 53 people across Amorgos and Santorini, with more than 100 people injured. More than 500 houses were destroyed in the earthquake, with many more badly damaged.', 'The island of Crete has suffered a series of high magnitude earthquakes in recent years. In 2013, 2020 and 2021 the island has suffered earthquakes with magnitudes in excess of 6.0.', 'Santorini is a volcanic island, curving around a flooded caldera. The island, as it is recognised today, formed following the Minoan volcanic eruption of 1600BC, one of the largest in human history. The last time the volcano erupted was in 1950, although this was relatively small and the chances of a major eruption are slim. The island witnesses a large explosion only once in every 20,000 years, and the last one was only 3,500 years ago.', 'The UK Foreign Office recommends reading the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection’s advice on how to prepare for and stay safe during an earthquake.', 'The ministry says that during an earthquake, you should take cover under sturdy furniture, or lower your height as much as possible. They advise to move away from large glass surfaces, like windows, and to refrain from going out of the house or onto a balcony. If outdoors, the ministry advises to to move away from buildings or telephone pylons, and to cover your head.', 'Santorini welcomes 3.4m tourists every year, and has become a firm favourite among British holidaymakers in recent years.', 'At the time of writing, the Foreign Office has not issued a formal warning to avoid travelling to Santorini as a result of the recent seismic activity. It is impossible to predict whether Santorini could be hit by a stronger tremor, but it is quite possible there will be more quakes in days to come.', 'Hotels and restaurants remain open. One hotel on higher ground in Santorini is offering itself as a refuge for tourists on the island. Daniel Kerzner of SantoriniSky told The Telegraph: “Given our unique location of 2,000ft from the Aegean Sea, we are well protected, and likely the most protected hotel on the island.', '“In addition to our location at the highest point on Santorini, the resort is also built directly into the rock. As a new construction it is built to withstand such activity. Any residents or tourists on the island who may need support are welcome to enjoy the hospitality and comfort we offer in our Sky Lounge during this time.', '“Our team is prepared with extra food, water, amenities and support for anyone who may require it.”', 'Some tourists are pre-emptively fleeing the island. Patrice Lamouroux from Angouleme, France, travelled from Santorini to Crete by ferry yesterday. He told The Telegraph: “Prices of airline tickets are sky high because lots of people are trying to leave the island. Also by boat. I was told that there are four stages before [a volcanic] eruption and there have been three of these stages. It’s worrying.”', 'If you have booked to travel to Santorini in the next week or two, and wish to cancel your holiday, then you will not automatically be eligible for a refund from your airline or tour operator given that no formal travel warning has been issued by the FCDO.', 'However, if you are feeling nervous about visiting the island and do wish to cancel or postpone, you should contact your holiday company or airline as soon as possible to see if they will grant any flexibility given the circumstances.', 'Aegean Airlines, for example, is offering flexibility. On Monday morning, it tweeted to say that all passengers with tickets to and from Santorini up until February 9 can change their flight at no extra cost, with a new travel date up to March 31 or the option for a credit voucher.', '', '', '', '', '']"
Underwater seismographs planned to study Santorini’s Kolumbo volcano,https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/environment/1260635/scientists-to-install-underwater-seismographs-to-study-santorinis-kolumbo-volcano/,"['Four state-of-the-art portable underwater seismographs that will study the underwater volcano of Kolumbo in Santorini were being installed inside the caldera on Tuesday and next to the submarine fault of Anydros, by an international team of researchers, following a spike in seismic activity in the area.', 'The team includes scientists from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel and the University of Potsdam, as well as the professor of Geological Oceanography of the Department of Geology and Geoenvironment of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) Evi Nomikou.', 'The international research team is in Santorini participating in the oceanographic mission MSM132, which aims to explore the submarine volcanic centres of Santorini and understand the geological processes occurring in them.', 'The underwater seismographs that will be installed are equipped with special sensors to measure the microseismicity of the area, ground movements, and also the physicochemical parameters of the water. It was preceded by the installation last December of three more underwater seismographs inside the Kolumbo crater and five in the sea area of Kolumbo and Anydros basin.', 'The selection of the area to carry out the mission had already been made in the context of the research project, as it is an area with a history of numerous volcanic eruptions and seismic events in the past. However, the current juncture will help scientists have more scientific data at their disposal.', '“The research mission was scheduled to take place, however the scientists who work in the area are present and constantly analyse the data resulting from the seismic activity in order to inform the authorities and the residents,” Evi Nomikou told the state-run Athens-Macedonian News Agency. These seismographs will remain in the subsea space for four days and then be retrieved to analyse the data. The survey will be repeated as long as seismic activity continues.', '“Our goal with these measurements is to collect in a short period of time data on the microseismicity of the area, which will be combined with the terrestrial seismographs, so that we can have better results in the analysis of earthquakes,” she added.', 'From January 27 onwards, the earthquakes noted are located in the sea area northeast of Santorini, in an area adjacent to the underwater volcano of Kolumbo. “During the crisis of 2011-2012, the seismic activity we had inside the caldera of Santorini for 14 months did not lead to a volcanic eruption. Intense seismic activity next to an undersea volcano can weaken without leading to an undersea eruption. However, the need to monitor the underwater volcano by installing special instruments that measure the changes in the chemical composition of the gases and liquids released from the hydrothermal vents at a depth of 500 meters is imperative,” Nomikou explained.', 'The survey results will be combined with measurements from the SANTORY underwater observatory, which has been collecting data since December 2022, and analysed to find differences in the volcano’s behaviour. SANTORY’s digital platform provides the scientific community and the public with valuable information about the Kolumbo undersea volcano.', 'The specific research program, which is led by NKUA, was completed in November 2024 and, as Nomikou said, its funding had been requested from the municipality of Thera (Santorini), a request that remained pending. Nomikou has once again requested that the state continue financing SANTORY.', '[AMNA]', 'Enter your information below to receive our weekly newsletters with the latest insights, opinion pieces and current events straight to your inbox.', '', '', 'PROPERTY OF: NEES KATHIMERINES EKDOSEIS SINGLE MEMBER S.A. © 2014 - 2025', 'Powered by']"

While a tsunami is improbable, a 1956 earthquake did lead to such an event.', 'Kaviris therefore advised people in the region to seek higher land during the current round of tremors, rather than taking a boat to the mainland.', '""They should leave the beach and go to a higher place,"" he said.', 'Landslides and rock falls have already been reported in some parts of the archipelago. This also poses a safety risk.', '""In the last two days when the seismic activity increased with strong earthquakes in the area, we saw landslides in places in Santorini,"" structural seismologist Basil Margaris from Greece\'s Institute of Engineering Seismology and Earthquake Engineering told DW.', 'Although newer buildings across the Greek islands have strict codes to meet, some older buildings may be vulnerable to more severe earthquakes.', '""People in Santorini prefer to live just at the edge of a place with a panoramic view, but on the other side, these areas are very dangerous,"" Margaris said.', '""In some cases, we have made some warnings to the local authorities to be more careful of these specific sites.""', 'Edited by: Fred Schwaller', '', '']"
