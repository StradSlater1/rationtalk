Both said no. Agents can be fired for corruption or incompetence after a review, but a mass firing for participating in an investigation is unheard of, they said.', 'What’s the larger context? The firing of top officials could make the FBI less effective in critical areas such as counterterrorism. And mass firings of FBI staff involved in the January 6 investigation would serve as a warning to bureau employees about what happens if they investigate Trump’s political allies, corroding the independence the agency depends on to enforce federal law.', 'What’s the long-term fear? Both historians mentioned potential long-term fears for the rule of law — and for civil liberties — if Trump continues on this path. “This is what authoritarian secret service and intelligence operations look like,” Beverly Gage, a history professor at Yale University who wrote a book about the FBI, told me. “They are the security wing of one man, serving at his behest, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies. … We’ve got a lot of battles ahead, but it is extremely bad news.”', 'As a reminder: Logging off doesn’t mean turning off your brain.

FBI staff ordered to reveal their role in Jan. 6 probes by Monday,https://www.arabnews.com/node/2588807/world,"['https://arab.news/jp4pf', 'WASHINGTON: FBI employees were ordered on Sunday to answer a questionnaire about any work they may have done on criminal cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, stoking fear about a fresh round of firings at the law enforcement agency. The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees to give their job title, any role they played in the investigations into the Jan. 6 riot by supporters of President Donald Trump and whether they helped supervise such investigations.\n“I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,” Chad Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters.\nYarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Monday.\nAn FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire.\nDemocrats and other critics have said Trump’s team is carrying out a purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters.\nOn Trump’s first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law enforcement officers.\nActing Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday demanded that the FBI by Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas group in connection with the Gaza war.\nHe also fired eight senior FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami and Washington, D.C., field offices.\nBove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving classified government documents.\nMark Zaid, a lawyer who specializes in national security, said in a letter to Bove that his actions appeared to be in violation of due process and if an individual’s information was made public, it could threaten their safety.\n“If you proceed with terminations and/or public exposure of terminated employees’ identities, we stand ready to vindicate their rights through all available legal means,” the letter, which Zaid released on X, said.\nActing FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email to staff on Friday announcing details about the order from the Bove, said the request “encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts.”\n“I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director (Robert) Kissane,” Driscoll noted.\nDespite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office, made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign.\nNevertheless, some employees on Friday started to clear out their desks amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents Association email seen by Reuters.\n“Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy,” Dennehy wrote on Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and Kissane for “fighting for this organization.”\nDennehy added that other than the select group of people named in Bove’s memo, “NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this time.”', 'WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said he will discuss the punishing tariffs he has levied on Canada and Mexico with both countries on Monday, after arguing that Americans may feel economic “pain” from the 25 percent duties but that it will be “worth the price.”\nSpeaking to reporters after he flew back to Washington Sunday evening from a weekend in Florida, Trump said he was “speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I’m also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.”\n“I don’t expect anything very dramatic,” he added.\nTrump has also hit China with a 10-percent tariff in addition to levies already in place.\nA fervent supporter of tariffs, Trump had always maintained that their impact would be borne by foreign exporters, without being passed on to American consumers, contradicting the opinion of a broad range of experts.\nEarlier Sunday he acknowledged, in a series of messages on his Truth Social network, that Americans may feel economic “pain” from his tariffs, but argued it would be “worth the price” to secure US interests.\nChina, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.\n“Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)” Trump wrote Sunday morning in all-caps on his Truth Social media platform.\n“But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.”\nAnalysts expect the trade war to slow US growth and increase prices, at least in the short term, something the president had resisted acknowledging after frustration over rising costs was seen as a major factor in his 2024 election win.\nSeeking to limit a spike in fuel prices, Trump has put the levy on energy imports from Canada at only 10 percent.\nThe president has cited illegal immigration and the trafficking of the deadly opioid fentanyl as reasons for the “emergency” measures.\nBut on Sunday he also expressed general outrage at trade deficits, which he has long viewed as signs of unfair treatment against the United States.\n“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the ‘Stupid Country’ any longer,” he wrote.\nThe tariffs announcements capped an extraordinary second week of Trump’s new term, with the president facing the worst US aviation disaster in years — even as his administration moved to drastically overhaul the government in actions decried by critics as illegal.', 'While some economies believe the levies are likely to be temporary, the outlook is unclear because the White House set very general conditions for their removal.\nA White House fact sheet gave no details on what the three countries would need to do to win a reprieve.\nTrump vowed to keep them in place until what he described as a national emergency over fentanyl, a deadly opioid, and illegal immigration to the United States ends. China left the door open for talks with the United States. Its sharpest pushback was over fentanyl.', 'Canada hits back\nIn a separate social media post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, repeating his call for America’s northern neighbor to become a US state.\nClaiming the United States pays “hundreds of billions of dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada,” Trump said that “without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country.”\n“Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State,” he said, reiterating the expansionist threat against one of his country’s closest allies.\nThe US Census Bureau says the 2024 trade deficit in goods with Canada was $55 billion.\nCanadian backlash was swift, with video posted to social media showing fans at a Toronto Raptors game Sunday booing during the US national anthem.', '', '', '', 'Canada said on Sunday it will take legal action under the relevant international bodies to challenge the tariffs.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau also encouraged Canadians on Sunday to boycott their longtime ally after ordering retaliatory tariffs against $155 billion of US goods, from peanut butter, beer and wine to lumber and appliances.\nCanadian officials said they were preparing measures to help business who might be hurt by the trade war.\nTrudeau vowed Saturday to hit back with 25 percent levies on select American goods worth Can$155 billion ($106.6 billion), with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks.\nLeaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of US liquor purchases.\nThe White House has not publicly announced what actions could end the tariffs.\n“It’s hard to know what more we can do, but we’re obviously open to any other suggestions that come our way,” Canada’s ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman told ABC News on Sunday.', 'Mexico, China push back\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she, also, was awaiting Trump’s response to her proposal for dialogue.\nShe said she had directed her economy minister to “implement Plan B,” which includes unspecified “tariff and non-tariff measures,” promising to detail Monday the steps she intends to take.\nTrump said Sunday he also planned to hit the European Union with tariffs “pretty soon,” to which the EU said earlier it would “respond firmly.”', '“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” China’s foreign ministry said, adding that China has taken extensive measures to combat the problem.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, raising her fist in the air in a speech outside the capital, vowed resilience.\nShe accused the United States of failing to tackle its fentanyl problem and said it would not be solved by tariffs.\nSheinbaum said she would provide more details on Monday of the retaliatory tariffs she ordered this weekend.', 'Warnings of inflation, recession', 'EY Chief Economist Greg Daco said Trump’s tariffs could reduce US economic growth by 1.5 percentage points this year, throw Canada and Mexico into recession and usher in “stagflation” — high inflation, stagnant economic growth and elevated unemployment — at home.\nTrump’s move was the first strike in a what could be a destructive global trade war that Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said would lead to a surge in US inflation that would “come even faster and be larger than we initially expected.\nUS crude oil futures jumped more than $2 to hit $75 per barrel, while stock futures fell. The S&P 500 E-mini futures were down 2 percent, while Nasdaq futures were down 2.75 percent.\nThe Trump tariffs, outlined in three executive orders, are due to take effect 12:01 a.m. ET (0501 GMT) on Tuesday. Markets were awaiting developments with anxiety, but some analysts said there was some hope for negotiations, especially with Canada and China.\n“The tariffs look likely to take effect, though a last-minute compromise cannot be completely ruled out,” Goldman Sachs economists said in a note Sunday.', 'The tariff announcement made good on Trump’s repeated 2024 campaign threat, defying warnings from economists that a trade war would erode growth and raise prices for consumers and companies.\nTrump declared a national emergency under two laws, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, which give the president sweeping powers to impose sanctions to address crises.\nTrade lawyers said Trump could face legal challenges for testing the limits of US laws. Democratic lawmakers Suzan DelBene and Don Beyer decried what they called a blatant abuse of executive power. Others warned about rising prices.\n“No matter which way you slice it: costs are going to climb for consumers,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, vowing to try to “undo this mess.”\nRepublicans welcomed Trump’s action.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed Americans were divided on tariffs, with 54 percent opposing new duties on imported goods and 43 percent in support, with Democrats more opposed and Republicans more supportive.', 'Investors look ahead\nInvestors were considering the effects of additional tariffs promised by Trump, including those related to oil and gas, as well as steel, aluminum, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Trump has also vowed actions against the European Union.\nA European Commission spokesperson said the EU “would respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods.” Europe’s biggest carmaker, Volkswagen, said it was counting on talks to avoid trade conflict.\nAutomakers would be particularly hard hit, with new tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico burdening a vast regional supply chain where parts can cross borders several times before final assembly.\nTrump imposed only a 10 percent duty on energy products from Canada after oil refiners and Midwestern states raised concerns. At nearly $100 billion in 2023, imports of crude oil accounted for roughly a quarter of all US imports from Canada, according to US Census Bureau data.\nWhite House officials said Canada specifically would no longer be allowed the “de minimiz” US duty exemption for shipments under $800. The officials said Canada, along with Mexico, has become a conduit for shipments of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the US via small packages that are not often inspected by customs agents.\n ', 'TBILISI: Police in Georgia arrested several anti-government protesters on Sunday as thousands of demonstrators demanding new parliamentary elections briefly blocked a motorway on the edge of the capital Tbilisi.\nA Reuters reporter saw three protesters being arrested, including Nika Melia, a leader of the country’s largest opposition party, the Coalition for Change.\nInterfax news agency reported that Melia has since been released on bail after detention for an administrative offense.\n“At the police station, I was sitting on a chair in handcuffs and was kicked by a police officer,” Interfax cited Melia as telling journalists afterwards.\nReuters could not independently verify the information.\nThere was no immediate comment from the police. Georgia’s Ministry Of Internal Affairs had said in a statement before the protest that the police would ensure the rally took place “in a peaceful environment, within the limits established by law.”\nFormer Tbilisi Mayor Giorgi Ugulava was also arrested, local media reported.\nGeorgians have been rallying nightly since November, when the ruling Georgian Dream party said it was suspending European Union accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a long-standing national goal.\nGeorgian Dream held onto power in a disputed election in October that opposition parties say was rigged. The government says the vote was fair and free.\nProtests had dwindled in recent weeks but they resumed with greater force on Sunday when thousands of people gathered outside a shopping complex on the northern edge of Tbilisi and briefly blocked the road leading out of the city. Police presence at the rally was considerable. Earlier on Sunday, the Interior Ministry warned protesters in a statement that blocking the motorway was a criminal offense.\nOne protester was seen by the side of the road, unconscious. Reuters was unable to establish what had happened to him.\nUnverified video footage posted on social media showed scores of police in balaclavas beating protesters on the streets and others carrying away injured demonstrators into ambulances.', 'WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa because he claimed, without evidence, that “certain classes of people” were being treated “very badly.”\n“South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n“The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!” he added.\nIn 2023, the United States obligated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa, according to US government statistics.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said last month that he was not worried about the country’s relationship with Trump.\nRamaphosa said at the end of January that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.\nDuring his first administration, Trump had pledged to investigate the unproven large-scale killings of white farmers in South Africa and violent takeovers of land.', 'PANAMA CITY: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio brought a warning to Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino on Sunday: Immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the Panama Canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.\nRubio, traveling to the Central American country and touring the Panama Canal on his first foreign trip as top US diplomat, held face-to-face talks with Mulino, who has resisted pressure from the new US government over management of a waterway that is vital to global trade.\nMulino told reporters after the meeting that Rubio made “no real threat of retaking the canal or the use of force.”\nSpeaking on behalf of Trump, who has demanded that the canal be returned to US control, Rubio told Mulino that Trump believed that China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the United States to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.\n“Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the treaty,” the State Department said in a summary of the meeting.', 'The statement was unusually blunt in diplomatic terms, but in keeping with the tenor and tone Trump has set for foreign policy. Trump has been increasing pressure on Washington’s neighbors and allies, including the canal demand and announcing Saturday that he was imposing major tariffs on Canada and Mexico. That launched a trade war by prompting retaliation from those close allies.\nMulino, meanwhile, called his talks with Rubio “respectful” and “positive” and said he did not “feel like there’s a real threat against the treaty and its validity.”\nThe president did say Panama would not be renewing its agreement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative when it expires. Panama joined the initiative, which promotes and funds infrastructure and development projects that critics say leave poor member countries heavily indebted to China, after dropping diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and recognizing Beijing.\nRubio later toured the canal at sunset with its administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez, who has said the waterway will remain in Panama’s hands and open to all countries. Rubio crossed the lock and visited the control tower, looking down over the water below, where a red tanker was passing through.\nEarlier, about 200 people marched in the capital, carrying Panamanian flags and shouting “Marco Rubio out of Panama,” “Long live national sovereignty” and “One territory, one flag” while the meeting was going on. Some burned a banner with images of Trump and Rubio after being stopped short of the presidential palace by riot police.', 'Rubio also pressed Trump’s top focus — curbing illegal immigration — telling Panama’s president that it was important to collaborate on the work and thanked him for taking back migrants. Rubio’s trip, however, comes as a US foreign aid funding freeze and stop-work orders have shut down US-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries.\nIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Friday, Rubio said mass migration, drugs and hostile policies pursued by Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have wreaked havoc, and port facilities at either end of the canal are run by a China-based company, leaving the waterway vulnerable to pressure from the Beijing government.\n“The president’s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again,” Rubio said Thursday. “Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. That message has been brought very clear.”\nDespite Mulino’s rejection of any negotiation over ownership, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway and could lead to a rebidding process.\nWhat is unclear is whether Trump would accept the transfer of the concession to an American or European company as meeting his demands, which appear to cover more than just operations.\nRubio’s trip, which will also take him to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, comes amid a freeze in US foreign assistance. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting but details of those were not immediately available.', 'WASHINGTON: US billionaire Elon Musk attacked the US Agency for International Development on Sunday, calling it a “criminal organization” after President Donald Trump moved to freeze the bulk of Washington’s foreign assistance for three months.', 'USAID, an independent agency established by an act of Congress, manages a budget of $42.8 billion meant for humanitarian relief and development assistance around the world.', 'But it is one of the targets of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) headed by Musk, whom Trump has tasked with cutting the government workforce and slashing what the Republican calls waste and unnecessary spending.', 'Trump ordered a freeze on almost all US foreign aid, saying his administration will review spending to ensure money is distributed in line with his “America First” foreign policy.', 'The Trump administration has since issued waivers for food and other humanitarian aid. But aid workers say uncertainty reigns — and that the impact is already being felt by some of the world’s most vulnerable.', 'USAID is a criminal organization,“ Musk wrote on his X platform, replying to a video alleging USAID involvement in ”rogue CIA work“ and ”internet censorship.“', 'In a subsequent post, Musk doubled down and, without giving evidence, asked his 215 million X followers, ”Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including Covid-19, that killed millions of people?“', 'He did not elaborate on the allegations, which officials in the previous administration linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.', 'Mayhem', 'Two top USAID security officials were reportedly removed during the weekend after they tried to stop DOGE representatives from gaining access to restricted parts of the building, three sources said on Sunday.', 'The action added to the dozens of staff at USAID being removed from their positions, as Trump’s team moves to abolish the agency’s independence and possibly bring it under the control of the State Department.', 'USAID’s account on X had been disabled, and the agency’s website was still offline.', 'Nearly 30 career staff in the agency’s Legislative and Public Affairs bureau lost access overnight to their emails, at least five sources said, bringing the total number of senior USAID career staff who have been put on leave over the past week close to 100.', '“DOGE did access the building yesterday,” a senior Senate Democratic aide said, requesting anonymity to discuss the incident. USAID security officers tried to turn away DOGE personnel without security clearances.', '“They (security personnel) were threatened with action by the federal Marshals Service,” the aide said. Following the incident, the director of USAID security John Voorhees and his deputy were removed from their positions and put on leave, sources said.', 'Members of the group from DOGE were allowed to access several secure spaces, including the office of security and the agency’s executive secretariat.', 'There was no record of what information DOGE officials were able to obtain in those areas, but the offices they accessed included classified files and personal information about Americans who work at USAID, the sources said.', 'Katie Miller, a DOGE spokesperson, said on social media platform X that no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.', 'Matt Hopson, who was appointed as chief of staff by the Trump administration, has resigned, five sources familiar with the matter said.

the rapid-fire series of executive actions Trump and his allies have taken since he returned to the White House on Jan. 20.', 'The three cases were filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.', 'The first case, a class-action complaint, was filed by a group of nine unidentified FBI agents and employees of the agency against the Department of Justice.', 'That suit seeks to block the publication or dissemination of information in surveys the plaintiffs or their supervisors have been ordered to fill out identifying “their specific role” in cases involving the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot criminal cases, and the criminal prosecution of Trump himself for retaining classified records after leaving the White House in early 2021.', 'The suit says the survey was issued “to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer adverse employment action.”', '“Upon returning to the Presidency, Mr. Trump has ordered the DOJ to conduct a review and purge of FBI personnel involved in these

retribution by the now-pardoned and at-large Jan. 6 convicted felons.”', 'The complaint says that some of the plaintiffs’ personal information “has already been posted by Jan. 6 convicted felons on ‘dark websites.’”', 'A second suit, filed by the FBI Agents Association and seven unnamed agents against the DOJ, also notes the survey requesting information about whether the agents worked on Jan. 6-related criminal investigations.', 'That complaint asks a judge to protect the plaintiffs “from Defendants’ anticipated retaliatory decision to expose their personal information for opprobrium and potential vigilante action by those who they were investigating.”', 'An attorney for the agents in the second suit, Chris Mattei of Koskoff, Koskoff and Bieder, said in a statement, “The DOJ’s plan to release the names of FBI agents who investigated January 6th is an appalling attack on non-partisan public servants who have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities and our nation.”', '“It is clear that the threatened disclosure is a prelude to an unlawful purge of the FBI solely driven by the Trump Administration’s vengeful and political motivations,”  said Mattei. “Releasing the names of these agents would ignite a firestorm of harassment towards them and their families and it must be stopped immediately.”', 'CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ on the suits.', 'The third lawsuit was filed by the advocacy group Doctors for America against the Office of Personnel Management, the Health and Human Services Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration.', 'That complaint challenges the abrupt removal Friday from CDC and FDA websites “a broad range of health-related data and other information.”', 'Zach Shelley, an attorney for Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is representing Doctors for America in the suit, told CNBC that “without the information that the CDC and these other agencies have taken down, more people are going to get sick, more people are going to suffer and more people are going to die.”', 'Shelley said that under the Trump administration, “agencies are taking action that undermines their stated mission.”', 'The suit says that data is regularly used by “health professionals to diagnose and treat patients and by researchers to advance public health, including through clinical trials meant to establish the safety and efficacy of medical products.”', 'The removal of the data came two days after Charles Ezell, OPM’s acting director, issued a memo that ordered federal agency heads to “terminate” programs “that promote or inculcate gender ideology” and remove all websites, social media accounts and other media that have that goal.', 'Ezell’s order came more than a week after Trump signed an executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”', 'The suit says that before that unannounced removal, the datasets had been on the websites for years.', 'Their removal “creates a dangerous gap in the scientific data available to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, deprives physicians of resources that guide clinical practice, and takes away key resources for communicating and engaging with patients,” the suit says.', 'The CDC removed web pages for its Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System, pages devoted to data on “Adolescent and School Health,” as well as pages for “The Social Vulnerability Index” and “The Environmental Justice Index,” according to the suit.', 'Also removed was a

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they were told “they are likely to be terminated in the very near future…for such activity.” ', 'The FBI employees claimed in the lawsuit that these actions are illegal and will cause them severe harm for many reasons. First, the plaintiffs explained that there’s no “legitimate agency purpose for this list to be created or to exist.”', 'They argued that the creation and dissemination of the list violates their rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as government employees to protection from discrimination based on their political affiliations or perceptions of their beliefs.', 'The plaintiffs argued the Trump administration “clearly believes that persons who were involved in the investigation and prosecution of Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases are insufficiently politically affiliated with Donald Trump to be entitled to retain their employment.” ', 'The FBI agents also alleged the DOJ violated their rights under the 5th Amendment of the Constitution to privacy, due process and protection against reputational harm from government actors, as well as violating the Privacy Act', 'They argued the Trump administration has already damaged their reputations “by publicly stating and implying that their work on Jan. 6 and/or Mar-a-Lago cases was somehow wrongful, dishonest, politically motivated or improper.”', 'Also, they outlined the harms they would face if the list were to be released.

The Real Reason Trump’s Purge of Career DOJ Officials Should Alarm You,https://www.justsecurity.org/107110/trump-purge-justice-department/,"['by Sara Zdeb', 'January 30, 2025', '2020 presidential election, 2028 presidential election, Corruption, Democracy, Department of Justice (DOJ), election law, elections, Trump administration first term, Trump administration second term', '', '', 'Since taking office last week, the Trump administration has fired, demoted, and reassigned career investigators and prosecutors across the Department of Justice, moving rapidly to politicize an institution over which the president has reportedly said he has an “absolute right” to total control. Much has been said in recent days about the impact of these unprecedented personnel moves on the Department’s independence and continued ability to address urgent national security and public safety threats, not to mention the morale of its workforce. But the ouster of career Department officials creates another, more insidious potential threat: that Trump and his allies will use the Department to hold onto power in future election cycles, as they tried and failed to do in 2020.', 'As a former Senate investigator, I led the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies, including then-Acting Civil Division Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, to conscript the Department into helping overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Our investigation laid the groundwork for the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack’s (“January 6 Select Committee”) examination of the same misconduct, and was the first congressional inquiry to expose Trump’s repeated calls to Department leaders about the investigations he wanted them to conduct.', 'We also exposed Clark’s scheme to supplant then-Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and insert the Department in the appointment of swing state electors, along with other efforts by Trump and his allies to use the Department to overturn the election. By now, the ending of this chapter in the January 6 story is familiar: after Department leaders threatened mass resignations in a dramatic Oval Office meeting, Trump backed down from installing Clark as Acting Attorney General. As then-committee chair Dick Durbin said when we released our investigative findings, it was only because of “a number of upstanding Americans in the Department of Justice [that] Donald Trump was unable to bend the Department to his will.”', 'The Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation underscored a basic feature of the nation’s chief law enforcement agency: much of its work is guided by internal norms, not laws passed by Congress. These norms were put in place after Watergate to protect the Department’s independence from politics and ensure its decisions to investigate and prosecute are based only on the facts and the law. Oversight by Congress and independent Inspectors General can expose when the Department strays from its norms, but their implementation ultimately comes down to the principles of 115,000 individual Department employees.', 'One norm that is central to the Department’s independence is its longstanding policy restricting communications between Department officials and the White House about individual investigations, criminal prosecutions, and civil enforcement actions. This policy and a companion typically issued by the White House has been reaffirmed by Attorneys General and White House Counsels of both parties, and it’s designed to ensure that federal investigations and prosecutions are driven by facts, not politics. In 2020, these restrictions were flouted by high-ranking officials including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, who repeatedly asked Department leaders to open criminal investigations of false election fraud claims.', 'The Department’s norms don’t just insulate law enforcement decisions from politics—they also insulate politics from inappropriate law enforcement. Federal prosecutors have a well-established, legitimate role in enforcing criminal laws passed by Congress, including laws that punish the corruption of government processes (think bribery and fraud) and electoral processes (think campaign finance violations and ballot fraud). Because of the sensitivity of these types of enforcement actions, Department policy typically requires agents and prosecutors to consult with the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section before initiating them. These consultation requirements help ensure the Department applies the same standards to similar cases, so a Republican politician is treated no differently than a Democratic politician who engaged in the same misconduct. More broadly, they help ensure the Department makes decisions to investigate and prosecute based on the facts and the law, not politics or other improper considerations.', 'Norms also play a critical role in ensuring the Department stays in its lane during elections. The Public Integrity Section’s Election Crimes Branch has explained in longstanding internal guidance that the Department’s role in election crime cases is limited, and that “the Department does not have a role in determining which candidate won a particular election, or whether another election should be held because of the impact of the alleged fraud on the election.” This guidance also recognizes that “the fact of a federal criminal investigation may itself become an issue in [an] election”—a reality that undoubtedly motivated Trump’s demand that Department leaders “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me.” For these reasons, internal policy makes clear that “the Department should not engage in overt criminal investigative measures in matters involving alleged ballot fraud until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.”', 'Department officials deviated from this longstanding norm in 2020 at the encouragement of then-Attorney General William Barr. Days after the 2020 election, when claims of a stolen election were in full swing, Barr issued a memo that loosened the Department’s longstanding restrictions on taking overt investigative steps in election fraud matters until the election is certified. The memo reportedly prompted objections by current and former Department prosecutors and led the longtime career head of the Public Integrity Section’s Election Crimes Branch to resign his position. Over the objection of career officials in the Public Integrity Section, Barr simultaneously directed federal prosecutors to investigate certain election fraud claims, including debunked allegations that Georgia election workers had secretly tabulated suitcases full of fake ballots. At the time Georgia’s elections had not yet concluded, with runoff elections scheduled a month later on January 5, 2021.', 'The extent of the Department’s deviation from longstanding norms during this period has never been fully examined, in part because the Department refused to divulge details of its work in response to bipartisan questioning by Senate staff, and in part because of the January 6 Select Committee’s understandable focus on Barr’s ultimate conclusion that there was no election fraud sufficient to alter the outcome of the election. Barr’s memo was withdrawn in early 2021, but the fact he issued it in the first place, and the way it enabled investigations beyond what the Department historically permitted, underscores how precarious even longstanding norms can be depending on who leads the Department.', 'The ongoing purge of career officials should worry anyone who cares about keeping politics out of the Department and the Department out of the business of deciding elections. Since last Monday, the administration has fired, demoted, and reassigned career investigators and prosecutors across numerous Department offices and law enforcement components. Those impacted include senior leaders in the Department’s Criminal and National Security Divisions, at least a dozen career prosecutors previously assigned to Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigations, and senior career leaders of the Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, among others.', 'The mass firing of Special Counsel Smith’s team has gotten significant attention, and deservedly so, for the message it sends to any Department employee thinking of investigating or prosecuting misconduct involving the president. But Americans should be just as alarmed by the reassignment and demotion of Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer, whose obscure-outside-the-Beltway title and low profile belie his critical role in upholding the Department’s norms. Until this week, he served as the Department’s senior-most career official. For decades and across administrations of both parties, Mr. Weinsheimer and his predecessors in that role advised Department leaders on ethics and recusal requirements and the longstanding requirements that keep politics and other improper considerations out of the Department’s work.', 'Equally concerning is the reassignment and subsequent resignation of Corey Amundson, the longtime career head of the Department’s Public Integrity Section. That office’s apolitical career prosecutors play an indispensable role in ensuring politically sensitive cases are handled appropriately, and that the Department doesn’t overstep its role in election-related matters. The Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation revealed that in at least one instance, Mr. Amundson pushed to restrain the Department from inserting itself in a 2020 election-related investigation, warning that doing so “risks great damage to the Department’s reputation, including the possible appearance of being motivated by partisan concerns.”', 'The ousters of Mr. Weinsheimer and Mr. Amundson aren’t surprising, but they should alarm anyone who cares about the Department’s adherence to norms that uphold the rule of law. Of course, the Department’s norms aren’t just the province of high-ranking career officials—every investigator and lawyer must follow them, and the Department is filled with principled career and non-career employees at all levels who do. But the ongoing purge of the very officials responsible for policing those norms signals to the Department’s entire workforce that their jobs are at risk if they, too, prioritize rules that keep politics out of law enforcement.', 'In 2020, Trump tried and failed to use the Department to hold onto power. Although some Department officials strayed from certain norms, enough principled individuals took a stand when it mattered. He is now ousting the apolitical career officials responsible for ensuring the Department upholds its norms and traditions of independence. In doing so, he is laying the groundwork not only to use the Department for his own personal, political goals throughout his administration, but also to succeed in doing in the next election what he failed to do in 2020.', 'Editor’s note: This piece is part of the Collection: Just Security’s Coverage of the Trump Administration’s Executive Actions ', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'by Konstantin F.
