This is not true,” WME—which also represents Reynolds and Lively—said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter Jan. 1.

""Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.""\n\nJenny Slate, who played the sister of Baldoni\'s character Ryle, also noted she stood with Lively.\n\n“As Blake Lively’s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,” Slate said in a Dec. 23 statement to Today. “Blake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her.”\n\n“What has been revealed about the attack on Blake is terribly dark, disturbing, and wholly threatening,"" she added. ""I commend my friend, I admire her bravery, and I stand by her side.”\n\nIn addition, Brandon Sklenar—a love interest for Lively\'s character Lily Bloom—shared a screenshot of the complaint published to The New York Times\' website and linked out to the outlet writing, ""For the love of God read this.""\n\nPlus, Lively\'s Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants costars America Ferrera, Alexis Bledel and Amber Tamblyn wrote they ""stand with her in solidarity.""', ""Dec. 23, 2024: Baldoni and Heath's Cohost on The Man Enough Podcast Leaves Show "", 'Liz Plank also announced her departure from The Man Enough Podcast, which she cohosted with Baldoni and Heath, on Dec. 23.\n\n""I\'m writing to you today to let you know that I have had my representatives inform Wayfarer that I will no longer be co-hosting The Man Enough podcast,"" she wrote on Instagram at the time.

I love what this community created together with every fiber of my being, and that\'s because of you.""\n\nWhile Plank did not give a reason for her exit from the podcast, it came days after Lively\'s complaint against Baldoni and his Wayfarer associates.\n\n""As this chapter closed for me, I remain committed to the values we\'ve built together,"" the author continued in her message to her followers.

""Behind Jones’s back, they secretly coordinated with Baldoni and Wayfarer to implement an aggressive media smear campaign against Baldoni’s film co-star, and then used the crisis as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Jones and Baldoni, and to publicly pin blame for this smear campaign on Jones—when Jones had no knowledge or involvement in it.""\n\nPer Abel\'s LinkedIn profile, she worked at Jonesworks until last summer. The lawsuit alleges Abel and Nathan ""continue to point the finger falsely at Jones now that their own misconduct is coming to light,"" and ""defame and attack"" her in the industry.\n\nAs for Baldoni and Wayfarer, who are no longer Jonesworks clients, the suit alleges they ""repudiated their contractual obligations with Jonesworks and rebuffed Jones’s efforts to settle this dispute privately in arbitration.""\n\nE!

She has denied this.\n\nThe New York Times said it plans to ""vigorously defend against the lawsuit.""\n\n“The role of an independent news organization is to follow the facts where they lead,” it stated to E!. “Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported.

""You don\'t make fun of the situation. You take it very seriously. You file HR complaints. You raise the issue and you follow a legal process.

News. ""This is not a \'feud\' arising from \'creative differences\' or a \'he said/she said\' situation. As alleged in Ms. Lively’s complaint, and as we will prove in litigation, Wayfarer and its associates engaged in unlawful, retaliatory astroturfing against Ms. Lively for simply trying to protect herself and others on a film set. And their response to the lawsuit has been to launch more attacks against Ms. Lively since her filing.""\n\n""While we go through the legal process, we urge everyone to remember that sexual harassment and retaliation are illegal in every workplace and in every industry,"" they added. ""A classic tactic to distract from allegations of this type of misconduct is to \'blame the victim\' by suggesting that they invited the conduct, brought it on themselves, misunderstood the intentions, or even lied. Another classic tactic is to reverse the victim and offender, and suggest that the offender is actually the victim.""\n\nLively\'s lawyers said ""these concepts normalize and trivialize allegations of serious misconduct."" They also noted ""media statements are not a defense"" to her claims and that they\'ll prosecute her claims in court.', 'In response, Baldoni\'s lawyer Freedman told E!, ""It is painfully ironic that Blake Lively is accusing Justin Baldoni of weaponizing the media when her own team orchestrated this vicious attack by sending the New York Times grossly edited documents prior to even filing the complaint.""\n\n""We are releasing all of the evidence which will show a pattern of bullying and threats to take over the movie,"" he added.

If the parties try to litigate this case in the press, the judge said he has the ability to move up the trial, currently scheduled for March 2026.', 'Attorneys for both Lively and Baldoni emphasized in court the negative impact the case has had on their clients.', '“My clients are devastated financially and emotionally,” Baldoni’s attorney Bryan Freedman said, adding that his clients have suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

Last month, he filed a lawsuit against Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.', 'At the time, Lively’s lawyer’s told CNN in a statement that Baldoni’s suit “is another chapter in the abuser playbook. This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim.”', 'The movie, from Sony Pictures, was released in August 2024 and grossed more than $148 million domestically.

It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting.

The Blake Lively row shows how toxic film sets can be. I should know,https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/the-blake-lively-row-shows-how-toxic-film-sets-can-be-i-should-know-bdx7fng0k,"['W\nhen people ask me why I quit acting, I am never quite sure what to say. Sometimes I tell them I quit because I had a baby. Other times because I wanted to focus on writing. The truth, however, is darker: I quit because of the repeated harassment I faced going to work, though I’m used to keeping this to myself, because it usually feels too sad to tell.', 'I loved being an actor. To this day I have amazing memories of working with people such as David Mitchell at the BBC. Making a movie is a high like no other. The 14-hour days mean you make deep friendships fast, and I will always feel privileged for some of the experiences that I had. But after ten years in the business, I felt I couldn’t continue.', 'Hollywood is reeling from the accusations being hurled back and forth by the actor Blake Lively and actor-director Justin Baldoni, who clashed during the filming of This Ends with Us in 2023. Just before Christmas, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and of starting a smear campaign against her. Baldoni then released a video he claims clears his name and says he will put all communication between himself and Blake on a website. It looks to drag on for even longer: the case now has a trial date of March 9, 2026.', 'The situation reminded me just how toxic film sets can be. I started acting as a teenager and stopped in my late twenties. Among other roles, I beat up Paul McGann in Luther, performed on stage at the Garrick Theatre and briefly appeared in Martin Scorsese’s Hugo.', 'Now I have written a novel, Where the Light Is Hottest, about my experiences on film sets. In it, the main character tries to deal with the octopus hands of a co-star. This happened to me. I was in my early twenties and he was sixtysomething. He told me women his daughter’s age (she was a teenager) kept hitting on him, but he only dated women in his age range: 25 to 35. He then grabbed my bottom while we were filming and repeatedly hit on me. Years ago, Gwyneth Paltrow said her main job on set was dealing with her male co-stars. This is what she meant.', 'On another set, I played a character called Lucy and a male actor, known for primetime television dramas and low-budget films, referred to me as “juicy Lucy” for the entire shoot while ogling me.', 'On another occasion, a casting director blacklisted me from auditions after I posted on social media about a celebrity who had a bad reputation, but only after offering me one last audition — for a role simply described as “whore”. I went to the audition anyway, thinking that if I took my punishment all would be forgiven and I might start getting auditions again. The dark look he gave me confirmed that would not be the case. No one from that agency ever brought me in again.', 'Actors also have to negotiate politics behind the camera. When I played a part in a film with a very well-known television actor, he complimented me to my face, all the while trying to get the director to fire me and give his wife my part. Between takes I could hear their conversation through the thin walls of the set, with the female director trying to manage him, saying they didn’t have time to replace me.', 'That’s the thing about being an actress: you’re always acting. Managing the flirting, the sexual advances, and saying yes to unreasonable demands because you know you are replaceable.', 'I saw assistant directors and producers hit on the extras and the walk-ons. Any actress who wasn’t a big name was fair game. Producers and directors may not use the casting couch in the way that Harvey Weinstein notoriously did, but they have certainly used it as a dating service.', 'When I was what actors call “resting” (translation: unemployed), I also worked as a casting director and producer. I would hear the producers and directors always talking about the “f***ability” of the actors. Scenes that involved nudity were filmed on the first day. If you did not do it, you were replaced.', 'The bad behaviour is not limited to the men.In 2010,I was delighted to be cast in a film, despite being told it was only for “having the best ass”. I practised my lines and carried around a heavy tray all day. I was so excited to be working with one particular actress, a national treasure. At lunch and breaktimes she was a total diva to the rest of the crew, and on one occasion tried to make me move from my seat because she wanted to sit there.', 'I could have moved, but there comes a point where you get sick of being treated badly. “You’re welcome to sit down. There is plenty of room,” I said. She flounced off like Regina George in the film Mean Girls, surrounded by her friends and bitching as she went. When I went to see the film at the cinema my scene had been cut completely.', 'Intimacy co-ordinators are a relatively new thing on film sets. They didn’t have them when I was acting, but they would certainly have made a difference. Actresses were constantly in touch with each other — a whisper network of solidarity — on casting-site forums and at industry events.', 'One casting director I auditioned for ended up being arrested for sexual assault. Luckily, I had taken my brother with me to that audition; I was quickly dismissed and didn’t make it past the first round. I heard that during later auditions he asked women to take their clothes off and pretend to be shot in the head while he filmed it all. It was ostensibly for a film about the Holocaust, but it never existed. Anyone could post an audition on acting sites, and some actresses were desperate for work. The “what if” haunted me for years. A lot of actresses I knew quit after this incident, horrified and scared that this predator was allowed to work unchecked.', 'The final straw for my acting career was when I sustained an injury so severe I needed years of physiotherapy to recover. During one scene, an actor was supposed to throw me down on a mattress, where we were supposed to simulate sex. There was no talk beforehand. He threw me so hard I slipped a disc. The injury hurts to this day. Thankfully, Equity, the actor’s union, was in my corner and I got an insurance payout.', 'At the time I was auditioning for US pilots and getting down to the last two for Nicole Kidman films, but something had to give. I decided to put my own wellbeing first and go into a nicer industry.', 'I took the money and wrote everything down. It was like therapy. My writing generally focused on the first MeToo movement, but Lively’s case has ushered in a second wave and shown that discrimination still exists, even at the top of the industry. I wish it didn’t have to be this way. Maybe one day I will go back and try to change it.', 'Where the Light Is Hottest is out on February 27 (Pegasus Elliot Mackenzie, £9.99)', '© Times Media Limited 2025.', 'Registered in England No. 894646.

During this conference, both parties will address Lively’s letter motion regarding pre-trial “publicity and attorney conduct.”', ""NBC News obtained a letter from Lively’s team to the judge filed Jan. 27 that requested a conference at the earliest convenience. In it, Lively’s team asks for a gag order preventing Baldoni’s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, from sharing “inflammatory content to tabloid media outlets that contains multiple false and defamatory statements and character attacks against Ms. Lively.” Her team also aims to halt the website Freeman previously said Baldoni's legal team would create “to release strategically selected documents and communications between Ms. Lively and Mr. Baldoni.” Lively’s team says the site “will be incomplete, biased, and prejudicial by design.”"", 'NBC News and TODAY.com have reached out to both Lively and Baldoni’s legal teams for comment regarding the trial date. ', ""The request came after Freeman released 10-minute behind-the-scenes footage of Lively and Baldoni filming a slow-dancing scene in an attempt to refute Lively's claims that Baldoni acted inappropriate on set."", 'In a statement to NBC News on Jan. 21, Lively’s legal team said that the video showed “Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character.”', '“Every moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present. Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively’s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively’s boss,” the statement continued, adding that the footage shows her “leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively’s discomfort.”', '“They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent,” the statement continued. Attorneys for Lively said that the video being released to the media instead of being used as evidence in court was “another example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public” and was “a continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.”', 'Additionally, Baldoni’s attorney, Freeman, told NBC in a statement shared Jan. 25: “The irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.”', 'Freeman added in part, “When you accuse innocent individuals of something so disturbing as sexual harassment without thinking of the destruction it would cause to not only them, but the entire domestic violence community, this is where accountability for such mean spirited actions must be taken.”', 'Freeman added that he and his team will always respect the court. “However, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts. All we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent smear campaign. It seems that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.”', 'In December, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on “It Ends With Us,” filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni.

Baldoni strongly denies that and has sued her in response.', 'Here is the story so far:', ""For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected.

techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni\'s credibility and suppress any negative content about him.""', 'In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to ""substantial harm"" that affected ""all aspects"" of her life.', 'Mr Baldoni\'s legal team told the BBC the allegations are ""categorically false"" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.', 'Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni\'s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: ""It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.""', 'Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including ""threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film"", which would end up ""ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met"".', 'Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.', 'Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they ""stand with her in solidarity"".', '""Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,"" they wrote.', 'Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as ""honest, kind, supportive and patient"".', ""In early December Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women."", 'The organisation has rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged ""abhorrent conduct""

Judge Issues Big Slap on the Wrist for Lawyers of Justin Baldoni & Blake Lively,https://www.jezebel.com/days-before-the-first-pre-trial-conference-justin-baldonis-attorney-followed-through-on-the-website,"['On Monday, the first court hearing in the public back-and-forth between It Ends With Us co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni took place in New York. The result? Judge Lewis J. Liman threatened that if both sides continued to litigate the matter in the press, he’d move their March 2026 trial date up. Just what we all need in these exceedingly unprecedented times! Lively and Baldoni weren’t present for the conference, but Liman warned their attorneys to avoid involving the public so as not to prejudice any future proceedings.', '“My clients are devastated financially and emotionally,” Baldoni’s attorney Bryan J. Freedman reportedly said in court, claiming that his clients (Baldoni; his studio, Wayfarer; the president of Wayfarer, Jamey Heath; and Baldoni’s publicists, Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel) have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages since the New York Times published their December 2024 report, “We Can Bury Anyone: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.” The 4,000-word story alleged that Baldoni not only sexually harassed Lively during the production of It Ends With Us, but participated in the orchestration of a smear campaign against her along with his publicists. According to Freedman, his clients hope for the case to proceed swiftly for the sake of their “future livelihood.”', '', 'Meanwhile, Lively’s attorney Michael Gottlieb called the “retaliation campaign” allegedly conducted by Baldoni’s team “devastating” for his client. “You’re not supposed to launch attacks on the other party’s character,” he said. Gottlieb added that he plans to file an amended complaint prior to February 14 that includes new claims and additional defendants.', 'Ahead of Monday’s conference, Lively and Ryan Reynolds moved to dismiss Baldoni’s case and Freedman finally debuted that website he’s been threatening to launch for weeks. TMZ reported on the site’s arrival on Saturday, which contains Baldoni’s 224-page complaint against both Lively and Reynolds and a 168-page “timeline of relevant events.” Included in the “relevant events” are a mass of text messages, emails, and other communications that appear to be between Baldoni and the couple (from their first meeting until the bitter end). Exchanges between Baldoni and his publicists, studio execs, and others involved in the production of It Ends With Us are also included.', '', 'But most of the communications have already been reported on—from Lively likening herself to Khaleesi to Baldoni’s apologies (via text and a 2 a.m. voice note) to Lively for alleged infractions like a disappointing response to her edits to the now-infamous rooftop scene. However, there is some new context in the form of text messages and notations that refute some of Lively’s most incendiary claims.', 'An example? Lively introduced Baldoni to her trainer and friend before production began in February 2023. According to the timeline—and when the working rapport between Lively and Baldoni still appeared, at the very least, civil and, at most, downright congenial—Baldoni ended up collaborating with the trainer on an exercise plan for the film. In an exchange with Lively around this time, she appears to joke about needing to lose 20 pounds; Baldoni “disliked” the text. Weeks later, Lively expressed concern about how her body would appear on screen.', '“As woke as we both are and work to be, this movie requires a certain aesthetic,” she wrote. Baldoni appeared to disagree, reassuring her that she “will look amazing” and needn’t “stress about her body.”', 'In March 2023, Lively wrote to Baldoni that she had strep throat. In response, he appeared to offer his holistic health coach who he said had “amazing gut health protocols that help after antibiotics.” The next month, she wrote that she’d fallen ill again. This time, Baldoni offered his health “intuitive” to help. You might remember that according to Lively’s complaint, these people weren’t a “health coach” or “intuitive” but weight loss specialists that she claimed were Baldoni’s way of fat-shaming her.', 'In April, Baldoni claimed that, because he has back issues, he was worried about a scene in which he was supposed to lift Lively. In preparation, he asked the trainer how to properly train his back to accommodate Lively’s weight. Days later, Baldoni claims to have been invited to Lively and Reynolds’ penthouse where Reynolds accused him of fat-shaming his wife.', '“How dare you fucking ask about my wife’s weight? What’s wrong with you?” Baldoni claims he screamed. Months prior, in February, Reynolds and Baldoni appeared to send each other lengthy text messages that appeared friendly. In the timeline document, Baldoni claims to have apologized for the misunderstanding and they were able to proceed. Later that month, Lively and Baldoni were apparently on such comfortable terms that she offered to fly him from New York (where the film’s pre-production was taking place) to California to see his wife and children. On the flight, according to the provided texts, they planned to work on the script together.', 'As the timeline continues, their working relationship soured, according to Baldoni. In his version of events, Lively became increasingly power-hungry and controlling in her demands. He and Wayfarer, according to the timeline, complied—in part, out of fear that she wouldn’t promote the film, thereby jeopardizing the work of countless people. It all culminates in the only thing we can be absolutely certain of: a very clear divide and two competing explanations as to why.', 'I won’t posture on who’s in the right here yet (read the documents for yourself), but the precedent a move like this website will set in Trump-era litigations certainly gives me pause. Here’s hoping Lively and Baldoni’s camps will keep this to a courtroom from here on out.', '', 'GET JEZEBEL RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX', 'Still here. Still without airbrushing.

However, Michael Gottlieb, representing the actress, said he was not seeking a full gag order but rather a court order to comply with existing rules dictating trial publicity.', '', 'As evidence of the need for the order, Gottlieb pointed to statements Freedman had made in the press accusing Lively of a pattern of bullying and saying that he had the “receipts” that would prove the case in publications including People and on the Megyn Kelly Show. Gottlieb further pointed to a website recently launched by Freedman’s team, which lays out the timeline of the dispute between Lively and Baldoni but features an editorialized narrative, according to Gottlieb.', 'He further added that his team will move to dismiss the addition of that timeline and narrative to the amended complaint filed by Freedman. In turn, Freedman read out statements Gottlieb’s team had made to the press, though Liman cautioned “You went a bit further than that,” even as Freedman said his team had to respond to the initial New York Times article about Lively’s complaint.', '“This was not started by us,” Freedman said.', 'But he also agreed to follow court rules on engaging with press, even before the court order. Liman said he was adopting the rule as an order of the court “with some reluctance,” as he did not want the case to devolve into “satellite litigation” over statements made by the attorneys. If issues persist, he added that he could also move up the date of the trial so as not to prejudice potential jurors, but he was also reluctant to do that given the amount of discovery that needs to be completed before then. “Damage is done before a jury speaks,” Freedman argued.', '“That’s the reason you each have sued,” Liman countered.', 'This was the first court hearing on the lawsuits brought by Lively and Baldoni. The suits have been consolidated into one case, while the litigation between publicists Stephanie Jones and Jennifer Abel remains separate.', '', 'The March 2026 trial date still stands, even as both sides contend with discovery from multiple parties. Freedman recently filed a revised complaint, which added The New York Times as a defendant. Gottlieb said his team was also thinking of amending their own complaint with new parties and claims but didn’t elaborate.', '“I couldn’t be more pleased with how the case was handled today,” Freedman said in a press conference outside the court hearing. “We’re going to move as quickly as possible and prove our innocence.”', 'Monday’s late-morning session in lower Manhattan marked the first court hearing in the dramatic showdown. The hearing was originally scheduled for Feb. 12, but Liman — the brother of veteran Hollywood director Doug Liman — moved up the date after attorneys for Lively and Reynolds repeatedly raised concerns that the Los Angeles-based Freedman is potentially violating attorney conduct by litigating in the press (and tabloids in particular).', 'Baldoni, Lively and Reynolds were never expected to attend; rather, a small army of lawyers representing the various sides turned up.', 'In her lawsuit, which was filed over Christmas, Lively accused her It Ends With Us director and co-star of sexual harassment and launching a smear campaign against her in the wake of the movie’s release as a means of deflection and retaliation. She also named Jamey Heath, Baldoni’s partner at production company Wayfarer Studios, crisis PR exec Melissa Nathan and Wayfarer publicist Jennifer Abel in the suit. The actress-producer is represented by Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher.', '', 'Baldoni responded by filing a $400 million lawsuit against both Lively and Reynolds alleging extortion and defamation. (He also names Lively’s longtime publicist Leslie Sloane and L.A. publicist Stephanie Jones). He and Freedman are also going after The New York Times, which detailed Lively’s allegations in a lengthy expose.', 'The Lively-Baldoni feud has put a spotlight on “astroturfing,” whereby publicists harness the Internet to sway opinion on social media. According to Lively’s suit, the alleged organized attack against has had profound consequences by rendering her depressed, and harming her family and business ventures.', '“Through this complaint, Ms. Lively seeks to set the record straight, to hold the Wayfarer Parties and Associates accountable, and to shine a light on this new form of retaliation so that it will not be used against any others who seek to stand up and speak out against sexual harassment,” stated her lawsuit. “In sum, Mr. Baldoni has crafted a public image of himself as not just an ally, but also a fierce advocate for women. Contrary to this image, as set forth in detail above, Mr. Baldoni has spent the last several months and significant resources on his goal of wanting to ‘bury’ and ‘destroy’ Ms. Lively for raising concerns about his and his CEO’s harassing behavior and other disturbing conduct.”', 'Baldoni’s side has insisted that the social media attack against Lively in favor of Baldoni is organic, and that they did not engineer it.', '', 'The outspoken Freedman has repeatedly said his client is the true victim, and that It Ends With Us was wrested away from him by Lively in the post-production process because of the power she and Reynolds enjoy.', 'Instead of directly addressing Lively’s complaint regarding Baldoni’s behavior on the set of the film, Freedman has instead leaked texts, voice memos and video to the press to dispute her version of events as laid out in her suit, which alleges other women also felt uncomfortable.', 'In asking the court to intervene regarding Freedman, Lively’s lawyers argued prior to the hearing that his various leaks and comments are likely designed to obscure that Ms. Lively is in possession of numerous additional communications relating to her claims.', '“If Mr. Freedman’s conduct is permitted, it will only result in an arms race of selective public disclosures of text messages to the media — that is neither encouraged — nor permitted, by Rule 3.6 or the federal rules. The Wayfarer Parties initiated their own claims in multiple lawsuits against multiple parties, and in doing so, had a full and unencumbered opportunity to include in their pleadings any and all text messages or other context they believed supported their claims,” stated a Jan. 27 letter asking for the gag order.', 'Gottlieb and Esra Hudson, attorneys for Lively, said in a statement following the hearing, “We are pleased with the result of today’s hearing and eager to move forward immediately with discovery in this case. The Court granted our request that all attorneys in the matter actually follow the rule of law and not make any statements that could prejudice a jury. This case deals with serious allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation. We will hold the defendants accountable, and we are confident that once all the evidence is submitted in this matter, Ms. Lively will prevail.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"
Blake Lively Moves to Depose Key Player in ‘It Ends With Us’ Justin Baldoni Feud; Court Sets First Hearing,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-first-court-hearing-1236119834/,"['', '', 'A New York court has also set a March 2026 trial date and intends to consolidate the crisscrossing lawsuits between Lively and her director and co-star, who is suing both Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds.', '', '', 'Blake Lively has moved to depose a key player whose crisis management firm Street Relations allegedly played a part in the smear campaign initiated by Justin Baldoni.', 'Lively filed a petition in Texas state court on Jan. 21 seeking a court order for a deposition of Jed Wallace, who was named in the complaint the actress filed with the California Civil Rights Department but not the lawsuit she filed in federal court. The filing is intended to obtain testimony for use in an anticipated complaint or to investigate a potential claim in ongoing litigation.', '', 'Lively’s lawsuit against Baldoni accused Wallace of weaponizing a digital army to create and promote content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums. Baldoni’s public relations team that allegedly orchestrated the campaign to undermine the actress would then feed pieces of the manufactured content to reporters, with the goal of making it go viral in order to “influence public opinion and thereby cause an organic pile-on.”', 'Wallace — who described himself as a “hired gun” and purported to have a “proprietary formula for defining artists and trends,” per the complaint — was retained on behalf of Baldoni and his company Wayfarer, who also brought on veteran crisis PR exec Melissa Nathan of The Agency Group (Nathan is named in Lively’s lawsuit). Lively detailed efforts by Wallace to “seed and influence online forums” on Reddit attacking her and defending Baldoni.', 'And in a decision that signals it could be receptive to a gag order against Baldoni’s legal team, a New York federal judge moved up a hearing to address an escalating request from Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, to bar Bryan Freedman, the lawyer for the It Ends With Us star and director, from trying the litigation in the press and biasing potential jurors.', 'U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ordered that a pretrial hearing set for Feb. 11 be moved up to Feb. 3 hours after Lively and Reynolds’ legal team sent a second letter alleging Freedman continues to violate court rules by making certain comments to the media on behalf of Baldoni and Baldoni’s production company, Wayfarer, among other tactics. Lively and Reynolds are represented by Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who first asked for a gag order last week.', '', '“The endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end. It will not stop without this court’s intervention,” states the Monday filing from Lively. “The Wayfarer Defendants’ efforts are being financed by a billionaire, who has pledged to spend $100 million to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family. Mr. Freedman is using that money, his roster of current and former clients, and a blatant media and social media strategy to assassinate Ms. Lively’s character in advance of trial.”', 'The actress-producer is accusing Baldoni of alleged sexual harassment on the set of the film, as well as orchestrating a smear campaign following the film’s release. Baldoni later filed his own complaint against the actress and husband Reynolds, seeking at least $400 million in damages.', 'Liman also revealed that the court plans to consolidate the separate lawsuits and set a March 9, 2026, trial date.', 'Monday’s letter to Liman from Lively and Reynolds’ legal team was sparked by a lengthy statement Freedman provided to TMZ and other media outlets on Jan. 25, including that “when you accuse innocent individuals of something so disturbing as sexual harassment without thinking of the destruction it would cause to not only them, but the entire domestic violence community, this is where accountability for such mean-spirited actions must be taken. We will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts.”', '', 'Counsel for Baldoni and his associates have repeatedly argued that the unfolding events have been “utterly calamitous” for Baldoni and his company Wayfarer, which is backed by billionaire Steve Sarowitz, and that they have been “exiled from polite society” and suffered damages “totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively’s scorched-earth media campaign.”', 'Meanwhile, Lively and Reynolds’ lawyers are also taking issue with a planned website that Baldoni will use to bolster his case by providing certain video, along with text and email exchanges. Lively’s lawyers argue there will be no way of knowing what he has omitted, or even deleted. “Mr. Freedman has made it apparent that he is engaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool. He further has made it clear that his priority is to ‘torpedo Blake Lively’s career for good’ by, among other things, creating a website to release strategically selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni,” stated the Monday filing.', 'Freedman also represents Baldoni in a separate lawsuit against The New York Times, which published a detailed story about Lively’s time on the set of It Ends With Us. The film was financed by Wayfarer and distributed by Sony.', 'Responding to Monday’s letter filed on behalf of Lively and Reynolds, Freedman said, “The irony continues to be rich for team Lively/Reynolds. Our intention with the upcoming website is to do the exact opposite of what they themselves did when they gave provably false information to the New York Times. We will not be selective, we will not cherry-pick and we will not doctor text messages. Both Ms. Lively and Mr Reynolds do not yet understand that there isn’t one rule for them and one rule for everybody else. If they want to unethically gag the truth by threatening to wield their power in Hollywood, we will fight it every step of the way. We are not scared of them, we will not be silenced by them. Defending ourselves is not retaliation, it is a human right.”', '', '“If Mr. Freedman’s conduct is permitted, it will only result in an arms race of selective public disclosures of text messages to the media,” Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for Lively, writes in the letter. “The Wayfarer parties initiated their own claims in multiple lawsuits against multiple parties, and in doing so, had a full and unencumbered opportunity to include in their pleadings any and all text messages or other context they believed supported their claims.”', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day', 'Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter', 'Send us a tip using our anonymous form.', '', '', '']"
