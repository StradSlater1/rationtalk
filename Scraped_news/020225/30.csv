Samsung’s S25 Ultra and the end of the flagship phone,https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/605734/samsung-s25-ultra-flagship-phone-china-data-vergecast,"['', 'On The Vergecast: Previewing the phones of 2025, debating data privacy in China, and replacing the Meta Portal.', 'by David Pierce', 'After almost exactly 18 years, you could make the argument that the tech industry has finally finished what the iPhone started. It’s not that there’s no innovation left in phones, or that there aren’t other big ideas to be had about the devices we carry around, but the specific thing the first iPhone was — a candy bar-shaped slab of glass in your pocket — might have reached its final form. Maybe there’s another reason that Samsung’s Galaxy S25 lineup looks so familiar, and why it appears this year’s other flagship devices will too. But maybe it’s just that there’s not much left to do here.', 'On this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Allison Johnson tells us all about her experiences with the S25 Ultra, supposedly the most interesting and experimental device in Samsung’s lineup, and why she’s a bit underwhelmed despite the fact that the Ultra remains an excellent phone.', 'We also discuss the phones left to launch this year, and whether this might finally be the year a new phone shape — flipping, or folding, or maybe tri-folding? — hits the big time. We have some theories, and a lot of hope, but are mostly planning for another year of the same old candy bars.', 'After that, we talk about China. Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, joins the show to talk about all the privacy and security questions surrounding TikTok, RedNote, DeepSeek, and the other apps connected to China that are hitting it big in the US. Quintin explains how to think about those apps compared to what Meta and Google are doing, explains how to think about your own threat model, and makes the case that what we really need is a federal privacy law.', 'Finally, we take a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about the Meta Portal. The once-hot video calling gadget is no longer for sale and appears not long for this world — so how are we all supposed to call the grandparents?

Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra brings in the camera upgrade I’ve been waiting for – Apple should be taking notes,https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra-brings-in-the-camera-upgrade-ive-been-waiting-for-apple-should-be-taking-notes,"['I think 50MP ultra-wide cameras should be the smartphone standard', 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', 'I’ve never been a huge fan of ultra-wide cameras, even on some of the best camera phones. Too often, the cameras don’t have a high enough resolution to produce crisp photos when scrutinizing the detail, or there’s too much warping on the edges. I’ve always felt the physical limitation of the small sensors and lenses used in smartphone ultra-wide cameras hold them back from delivering the more impressive shots of main and telephoto cameras.', 'I’ve also never been a fan of how Samsung’s ultra-wide cameras in its Galaxy S-series, with photos that appear noisy and lacking sharpness, even occasionally looking a bit smudged when peering deeper into a shot.', 'However, with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the South Korean tech giant appears to have turned a corner with its ultra-wide cameras. That’s because the S25 Ultra comes with a 50-megapixel rather than the 12MP ultra-wide camera of the Galaxy S24 Ultra.', 'It’s been a common idea that megapixels don’t mean a great deal when it comes to smartphone cameras, especially those on the best phones. But I’m starting to see a shift in the sands in that there’s only so much smart computational photography can do with 12MP sensors and images. In contrast, more detail sucked in by a higher megapixel sensor effectively means more data to process and, thus, more scope to get a better photo.', 'With the caveat that others on the TechRadar team and I are continuing to test the Galaxy S25 suite of smartphones, I quickly pitched the ultra-wide camera of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the 12MP ultra-wide on my iPhone 16 Pro Max; my main phone.', 'In the photo samples below, you’ll see the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s ultra-wide camera in its default 12MP mode – an annoying default, but I understand it saves on file size – and 50MP shots, alongside 12MP iPhone 16 Pro Max snaps.', 'At a quick glance, it’s not particularly easy to see huge differences between the shots other than different interpretations of colors; Samsung, as usual, favors punchier colors over the iPhone’s more muted take.', 'But look closer, and you’ll see finer details in the foreground of the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s 50MP ultra-wide shots vs the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s. Punch into a shot, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra resolves sharper details than its rival.', 'The same is broadly true when comparing the 12MP ultra-wide versus the 50MP shots on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You have to go on the hunt for changes, as both shots use the same camera sensors; just the 12MP images are being produced with pixel-binning to make a 50MP snap smaller.', 'Still, from what I can tell, this process naturally loses some detail on a shot but also removes a degree of dynamic range; in the 12MP shots, shadows and highlights are more uniform, whereas in the 50MP photos, there’s more of a gradient from light to dark.', ""I find this pertinent, as recent conversations about flagship phone cameras have focused on how they tend to produce somewhat flat photos by bringing up the shadows and pulling down bright parts. This can bring out more detail but results in a photo that doesn't look quite true to life and ends up lacking some contrast that can help make a photo pop."", 'So, my key takeaway for anyone planning to get a Galaxy S25 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode in the ultra-wide camera for the best results.', 'And I think this is a sign that Apple should look to follow the example set by the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Google Pixel 9 Pro, as well as the Pixel 8 Pro, and adopt a larger pixel count with the ultra-wide camera on the iPhone 17 Pro.', 'Head to the comment and let me know which ultra-wide photos you prefer, and do check out our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review; also, keep TechRadar bookmarked as we’ll have more thoughts and experiences with the Galaxy S25 phones as we keep digging into them.', 'Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.', 'Roland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.

Expectations for artificial intelligence (AI) functions led to purchases.', 'By model, the Galaxy S25 Ultra had the highest sales volume. In the case of SK Telecom, 6 out of 10 pre-order buyers held Ultra in their hands. In KT and LG U+, more than half of pre-order buyers also chose Ultra.

It also has a solid camera system and what looks to be a good battery life. If it feels like we've done this song and dance before, it's because we have."", 'The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is aging gracefully and brings along a beautiful display, solid overall performance, all-day battery life, and a great software experience. Some aspects are starting to show its age, but this phone is still one of the best two years after its initial release.', 'It wasn’t long ago that Samsung was the undisputed leader in the Android space, pushing the boundaries of smartphone design and capabilities. Somewhere along the way, it lost its way by resting on its laurels for too long and failing to innovate. Don’t get me wrong. Samsung makes quality traditional-style smartphones and some of the best foldables, but compared to a phone like the OnePlus 13, its latest devices are missing the spark that Samsung used to be known for.', '', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra could have easily been a show of strength. Instead, Samsung kept the status quo, which has led to an unimpressive first impression. If you own the Galaxy S23 Ultra, you may wonder if Samsung’s latest and greatest is worth the cost or the hassle of upgrading your phone. Let’s break it down and see if Samsung has done enough to entice the users of an excellent two-year-old device.', 'Top-tier smartphones with distinct capabilities', 'Starting with the latest and greatest, the Galaxy S25 Ultra hits the market in February 2025 and is available in three storage sizes. You can get it with 256GB of storage for $1,300, 512GB for $1,420, or 1TB for an eye-watering $1,660. There are seven rather boring color options, including Titanium Jetblack, Pinkgold, Jadegreen, Black, Gray, Silverblue, and Whitesilver. The first three color options are Samsung exclusives. Samsung flagships are simple to find and are available from all major carriers, Samsung, and retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.', 'With a launch date of February 2023, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is two years old. It’s available in the same 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities, which retailed for $1,200, $1,380, and $1,620, respectively. The available colorways were a little more colorful and included Phantom Black, Cream, Green, Lavender, Lime, Graphite, Sky Blue, and Red. At launch, you could find it in the same places as the S25 Ultra. However, two years after launch, it’s become harder to find. Unless you find it at a sizable discount, it’s not worth getting the older phone at full price.', ""And that's exactly what makes it so exceptional"", 'Samsung updated the design of the S25 Ultra this year, getting rid of the squared-off, boxy design and rounded edges of the S23 Ultra. Instead, it opted for rounded edges and flat sides. Samsung isn’t the only company heading down this Apple-like path of phone design. Google did the same with the Pixel 9 series, like the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I don’t mind the new design of the S25 Ultra, but the Galaxy S23 Ultra had that unique and better look that defined the Ultra series.', 'From a size perspective, these two phones are practically identical. At 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm and weighing 218g, the S25 Ultra is slightly smaller and lighter than the S23 Ultra’s 163.4 x 78.1 x 8.9mm dimensions and 234g in weight. The S25 Ultra features all the latest build materials, including a titanium frame and Gorilla Armor 2 protecting the front and back. The S23 Ultra has an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protecting the front and back. Both devices carry an IP68 rating, making them dustproof and water-resistant up to 1.5m for 30 minutes.', 'The included S Pen is a major reason many people opt for Samsung’s Ultra series, but Samsung decided to mess with it this year. Both devices come with the S Pen, which slots nicely into the bottom of the device, but the S25 Ultra’s version of the S Pen forgoes Bluetooth connectivity. This means functions like Air Commands and using the S Pen as a remote shutter to take a photo are no longer options on the newer device. The S23 Ultra’s S Pen has Bluetooth, so it’s something to consider if you heavily rely on it.', 'Looking at the back, you’ll see a familiar camera setup in the upper-left corner, with each lens prominently displayed. The lenses on the S25 Ultra appear larger, but the overall look and feel are nearly identical.', 'Samsung is well known for its excellent displays, and it’s clear both of these devices come with high-quality panels. The S25 Ultra has a 6.9-inch dynamic LTPO AMOLED display with a 3,120 x 1,440 resolution. You get a smooth 120Hz refresh rate and a bright 2,600 nits of peak brightness, making everything smooth and easy to see in the brightest of conditions.', 'The Galaxy S23 Ultra has a slightly smaller 6.8-inch dynamic AMOLED display with a resolution of 3,088 x 1,440. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 1,750 nits of peak brightness. Both devices can drop their respective refresh rates down to 1Hz when it’s not needed to save battery.', 'Some nitpicking can be done in the comparison, namely the slightly larger and brighter display of the S25 Ultra. In the end, both phones have excellent displays. The biggest difference is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a flat display while the S23 Ultra has a curved display. Curved displays aren’t for everyone, but if you’ve used your phone for this long, it likely doesn’t bother you, but it’s worth noting.', 'Being Samsung’s newest device, it makes sense that the Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with Android 15 and One UI 7. The S23 Ultra originally came with Android 13 and One UI 5.1 but has been upgraded to Android 14 with One UI 6.1.1. Over the next few months, Samsung should upgrade the S23 Ultra to Android 15 and One UI 7, which puts both devices on a level playing field.', 'If you’re rocking the S23 Ultra, you know what to expect here. For the uninitiated, One UI 7 is a great Android skin that offers a range of customization options and Galaxy AI. Productivity features like running multiple apps at the same time or using DeX allow you to connect your phone to a hub or docking station to turn it into a desktop experience.', 'A few enhancements come with One UI 7, some of which may be polarizing. You’ll get the Now Bar, which is a Dynamic Island-like replacement for the lock screen, so you can control various things such as your music. In addition to the Now Bar, you get Live Notifications, a return to the vertical app drawer, new animations, and revamped icons.', 'With a big focus on AI, One UI 7 comes with new AI-related features. Bixby is being replaced with Google Gemini, something I have long wanted. This change may or may not come to the S23 Ultra when it gets One UI 7, so keep an eye out for details as they become available. Then there are new features such as Now Brief, which aggregates all your data into an easy-to-view window, giving you an at-a-glance overview of your day.', 'The main difference is their software support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has seven years of Android OS upgrades and security updates. The S23 Ultra gets four years of Android OS upgrades and five years of security updates. That means the S23 Ultra will stop getting Android upgrades after Android 17, which gives it plenty of support left.', 'Samsung typically outfits its Galaxy S-series lineup with the latest powerful Snapdragon processors. At least, that’s the case in the United States. The S25 Ultra is rocking the extremely powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite that’s paired with 12GB of RAM. It’s a world-class chip that won’t struggle with any task you conjure up, including the latest games or video editing.', 'The two-year-old Galaxy S23 Ultra has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor that’s paired with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. In 2023, it was the best processor available on an Android device, and it’s still a solid performer two years later.', 'Smartphone processors have been quite capable and powerful for the past couple of years. Any recent Snapdragon flagship chipset is more than capable of running routine daily tasks, and it can hold its own when gaming. On paper, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is stronger than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but the difference is negligible in everyday use. New can be better, but chasing the latest shiny object doesn’t always lead to significant benefits. If you’re a competitive gamer or need the extra power of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, your decision should be simple, but the extra horsepower isn’t needed for most.', 'As reviews aren’t out for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the next two sections will be a best guess based on Samsung’s past devices. Not much has changed in the battery department, so unless the new Snapdragon 8 Elite is more power efficient than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, battery life should be fairly close.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra and S23 Ultra have 5,000mAh batteries that provide about a day and a half of use or roughly eight hours of screen time. They can charge up to 45W wired, which is a bit slow compared to some of the competition. The S25 Ultra can be charged wirelessly up to 25W, while the S23 Ultra tops out at 15W. They are both capable of 4.5W reverse wireless charging.', 'I would have loved for Samsung to go with a higher capacity or dual-cell battery to give a nice battery boost, but we’ll have to settle for more of the same. I don’t care too much about the charging speeds as I charge my phone at night, but it needs to be acknowledged that Samsung must figure out how to increase its charging performance.', 'Not many phones can compete with a Galaxy Ultra device from a versatility perspective thanks to its array of four lenses, each with its own capabilities. The S25 Ultra comes with a 200MP, f/1.7 OIS primary lens, a 50MP, f/1.9 ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view, a 50MP, f/3.4 periscope telephoto lens with OIS and 5x optical zoom, and a 10MP, f/2.4 telephoto lens with OIS and a 3x optical zoom.', 'The Galaxy S23 Ultra has the same 200MP, f/1.7 primary lens with OIS, a 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, a 10MP, f/4.9 periscope telephoto lens with OIS and 10x optical zoom, and a 10MP, f/2.4 telephoto lens with OIS and a 3x optical zoom.', 'Regardless of which device you’re holding, they can record 8K video up to 30fps. The S25 Ultra can do 4K video up to 120fps, while the S23 Ultra tops out at 60fps. Both devices have a 12MP, f/2.2 selfie camera that can record 4K video at up to 60fps.', 'The primary 200MP lens is one of the main reasons these phones are considered some of the best camera phones. It’s capable of stunning photos that will please any user. The S25 Ultra has better complementary camera lenses that can capture better detail with more megapixels. The S23 Ultra has 10x optical zoom, so it can zoom in a bit more than the 5x of the S25 Ultra, which then relies on sensor cropping and AI to make up the difference in zoom ability.', 'Thanks to Samsung sparing no expense with the hardware in Ultra phones, they tend to remain a viable option for many years. Because Samsung isn’t innovating at the same pace, you end up in a scenario where choosing to upgrade is no longer straightforward. A phone that’s two years old has no business keeping a head-to-head battle this close.', 'If you’re rocking a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, hold onto it for at least another year. The S23 Ultra has aged gracefully and is still a potent device. With an excellent display, more than capable performance, good battery life, and a nearly identical software experience, I see little reason for an upgrade. The S25 Ultra is the shiny new thing, but it’s not that much better. Unless you need slightly better cameras or a stronger processor, you can safely continue enjoying your S23 Ultra.', 'Still great two years later', ""The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is aging wonderfully and if you already own this amazing phone, then you can safely stick with it for another year. With a beautiful display, great performance, all-day battery life, and solid software support, there's a lot to love about the Galaxy S23 Ultra."", 'If you don’t own the S23 Ultra, default to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

In India, it remains the third leading cause of death among children under five. Despite being the gold standard treatment for diarrhea, WHO-recommended oral rehydration salts (ORS) remain underutilized. Data from the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) indicates that ORS usage among children under five stands at 60.6 percent.', 'The RTD WHO ORS addresses this gap by providing an accurately formulated solution that aligns with WHO osmolarity standards. This convenient format ensures ease of consumption and effective rehydration, potentially preventing up to 93 percent of diarrhea-related deaths. Research also suggests that reduced osmolarity ORS solutions can lower the need for unscheduled intravenous therapy by 33 percent', 'A Kenvue study published in the Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences highlighted significant preparation errors in powdered ORS solutions among Indian consumers. Variations in water measurements and taste preferences compromised efficacy, posing risks during diarrheal dehydration. Similarly, a study in rural Vasind, India, revealed that while many mothers knew ORS should be mixed with one liter of water, only 32 percent prepared it correctly.', 'The newly launched WHO ORS features Hydra-Activ Technology, ensuring 100 percent compliance with WHO osmolarity standards. This RTD product offers caregivers and healthcare professionals a reliable, hygienic, and convenient hydration solution. Available in Apple and Orange flavors, the product aims to mitigate water contamination and preparation errors linked with traditional powdered ORS.', 'Manish Anandani, Managing Director, India, Kenvue, stated, ""ORSL® is a priority brand in our global self-care portfolio. We continue to bring science-backed innovations and collaborate with healthcare practitioners to advance hydration solutions. The launch of the Ready-to-Drink WHO ORS formula reflects our commitment to addressing diarrheal dehydration with convenience.""', 'Prashant Shinde, Business Unit Head – Self Care, Kenvue added, ""With the introduction of Ready-to-Drink WHO ORS, we enter the space of diarrheal dehydration, solidifying our position in the hydration solutions market.""', 'Dr. C Suresh Kumar, Consultant Pediatrician at RVM Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad commented, ""WHO ORS is a gold standard in treating diarrhea-related dehydration. Ready-to-drink formulations ensure accurate osmolarity and aid recovery, addressing challenges with powdered ORS preparation.""', ""Kenvue unveiled the WHO ORS at Pedicon 2025, the 62nd National Conference of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics.

Galaxy S25 hits stores this Friday — here's the first feature I'm going to try,https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/galaxy-s25-hits-stores-this-friday-heres-the-first-feature-im-going-to-try,"[""Galaxy AI's cross app actions capabilities are tops on my list"", 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.', ""As you can see in either our review of the Galaxy S25 or our Galaxy S25 Ultra review, there are plenty of reasons to be intrigued by Samsung's new phones even if the new hardware hasn't changed that much. That's because Samsung has put the emphasis on Galaxy AI this time around, bringing a bunch of new AI-powered features while enhancing others that had launched with the Galaxy S24 a year ago."", ""Unlike some of my colleagues, I haven't had a chance to get my hands on the Galaxy S25 models yet, not even for a brief hands-on time. So when one of the new Galaxy phones does make its way to me, the feature I'm going to make a beeline toward is the newfound support for cross app actions."", ""Up until now, AI on your smartphone hasn't been much of a multitasker. Cross app actions changes that, as you can now use the Gemini assistant on board the Galaxy S25 to interact with both Google and Samsung apps. There's also support for Whatsapp and Spotify at launch."", 'Even better, Galaxy AI can now support multiple commands at once. If I want to look up what time the Super Bowl starts, I can also tell Gemini to send a text inviting my friends over at that time while blocking out an item on my calendar.', ""But there's more to it than that, according to Samsung. You'll also be able to snap a photo of what's in your refrigerator and have the AI come up with recipe of what you have on hand. You can give your assistant a research assignment and have them paste the results in a note. And all of this can be done with a single command — or so the sales pitch goes."", ""I'm very intrigued by the promise here, which is the ability to take care of different tasks without having to jump from one app to the next. Instead, Gemini handles it all for you, potentially saving you time. That's the kind of AI feature I want more of on my phone."", ""My colleagues have tested out cross app actions for their reviews, but I have a few other questions I'm hoping to get answered, either by using the feature myself or with more information surfacing overtime. Here's what I'm specifically hoping to find out."", '', 'Years of using digital assistants have made me a little paranoid that my seemingly reasonable request is going to produce the AI equivalent of a ""huh?"" Presumably, Galaxy AI responds well to natural language commands, but I\'m still curious to see if I have to phrase my request in a very specific way to get the result I want. How much trial in error is this going to require?', 'In a similar vein, I\'d like to know what happens if I request a cross app action that isn\'t supported. Ideally, the Galaxy AI would flag the specific part of my request that requires an app it can\'t quite work with yet — anything more helpful than a terse ""I can\'t do that."" Make me aware of what you can do.', '', ""I'm going to assume Samsung and Google put the emphasis on their own apps out of the gate as they could make sure those offerings were ready to go when the Galaxy S25 was. And let's be frank — a lot of people are going to use the on-device apps for texting, mail, notes and more."", ""But clearly, Samsung's going to want third-party apps to app support of their own. And if buy into the Galaxy S25, I'm going to want to be kept up to date on which apps those are and when I can expect cross app actions support to arrive for some of the big hitters beyond Whatsapp and Spotify."", ""That's not going to be an answer I find out right away, but it's still something I'm eager to learn."", '', ""Samsung doesn't add its features in a vacuum. On the other side of the mobile platform street, Apple's busy rolling out its own AI-powered features in the form of Apple Intelligence. And one of the still-to-come improvements will give Siri the ability to interact with other apps. That will mean Apple's assistant can perform complex actions with those apps and send messages directly within them. The word is that functionality is coming via the iOS 18.4 update, which is expected this spring."", ""I'm interested to see just how that behavior works at launch, including which apps will work with Siri right away and just how that compares to cross app actions on the Galaxy S25. Based on the rumors, it sounds like we'll have tha answer soon enough."", ""Not long after Samsung showed off the Galaxy S25 lineup for the first time, I suggested that the Galaxy S25 will be where the rubber meets the road for AI on smartphones — meaning here's where we'll find out if this is the game-changing evolution we've been promised. My experience with cross app actions once I try out the S25 won't be the final word on the subject, but it's going to go a long way toward cementing my opinion on mobile AI."", 'Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.', ""Philip Michaels is a Managing Editor at Tom's Guide.

Highlights include a stunning, high-resolution display, blazing-fast performance, and useful Galaxy AI features. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is our Editors' Choice winner for Android phones thanks to its unmatched camera system and artist-friendly S Pen stylus, but if the Ultra is too big or expensive for you, the S25+ hits its own sweet spot in terms of size, features, and performance at a more palatable price."", 'The Galaxy S25+ sits in the middle of the S25 lineup, which includes the larger Galaxy S25 Ultra and the smaller Galaxy S25 (starting at $799.99).

The S25+ is appreciably smaller than the S25 Ultra (6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches, 7.69 ounces) but significantly larger than the base S25 (5.78 by 2.78 by 0.28 inches, 5.71 ounces)."", '', 'The S25+ and S25 both have Samsung Armor Aluminum frames and use Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to cover their screens and back panels.

All three models have an IP68 rating, meaning they can withstand dust and water just as well as other premium handsets like the Apple iPhone 16 Pro and the Google Pixel 9 Pro, both of which start at $999.', ""The button and port layout remains the same as previous models. A volume rocker and power/side button are on the right, while a pill-shaped antenna indent is on the left. A SIM card tray, USB-C port (v3.2), and speaker slit sit on the bottom edge, while two mic holes are in the top edge. There's no headphone jack. Three individual camera lenses are stacked vertically on the back. The S25+ features bold black rings around each lens, a departure from the smaller silver rings of the S24 series."", ""Although the phone is large, its rounded corners make it comfortable to hold. Its build quality is excellent; the metal and glass materials form watertight seams. There's nothing wrong with the design, but it's not as eye-catching as it once was. In fact, it's barely changed in the last three years at all. Samsung should consider revising the design next year to keep things fresh and exciting."", ""The S25+ and the S25 are widely available at retail channels in the same colors: Icyblue, Mint, Navy, or Silver Shadow. Three other color options are available exclusively via Samsung's site: Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold. I find this color palette much more fun than the business-like options of the S25 Ultra. I tested the Navy variant. Its metallic finish creates a beautiful, rich color that I don't want to cover with a case (other than a transparent one). Your finger oils will show up on the rear panel as smudges, however."", ""Samsung sticks to an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint sensor as the phone's most secure biometric authentication method. It works consistently in testing, though not as flawlessly as the Ultra's. Face unlock is also an option, but not for authentication in bank-grade applications.

At 50MP, both the S25+ and the S25 Ultra perform similarly, with only minor differences visible at extreme zoom levels. The Ultra edges out the S25+ here.', ""The ultra-wide camera delivers pleasant images with good color and clarity, though fine details don't come across as well as the images from the S25 Ultra."", 'The 3x optical telephoto lens produces clean images, though the Ultra (again) has a slight advantage in fine detail.', 'Space Zoom (up to 30x) is fine in a pinch but introduces color blotching and blurriness. The Ultra resolves small text better at this range and offers up to 100x zoom. The S25 Ultra has a second telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, which gives it superior resolving power.', 'The S25+ handles low-light scenes well, producing bright, clear images. Main camera shots at 12MP are nearly identical to those from the Ultra. At 50MP, colors remain rich, though the Ultra pulls slightly more detail from the shadows.', ""Ultra-wide shots are slightly darker and grainier compared with the Ultra but brighter than those from the S25+'s main camera."", 'The 3x telephoto lens captures fine details well, though some light sources appear softer compared with shots from the Ultra.', ""All three Galaxy S25 phones use the same 12MP f/2.2 front-facing camera, so it's not surprising that the Galaxy S25+ performs just as well as the S25 Ultra in this regard. It produces sharp, slightly bright images with good color. The bokeh tool can be a little aggressive, but you can dial that down in the Gallery app if you wish."", ""Video recording is available at up to 8K resolution at 30fps, though I noticed some jitters with walk-and-talk footage, especially in low light. Dropping to 4K60 improves stability, reduces shake, and enhances brightness, making it the better choice if you want to shoot at a higher resolution than HD. The phone's optical image stabilization works well to counter hand movements. Colors look good across all settings but are more vibrant at 4K and below. Of note, Samsung has added support for Log video capture. This is for professionals who want to be able to apply color profiles after the fact."", ""All Galaxy S25 phones ship with Android 15 and Samsung's One UI 7 atop it. Matching Google's Pixel policy, the S25+ will receive seven generations of OS updates and seven years of security upgrades."", ""One UI brings a great deal of functionality, like Galaxy AI and Samsung's custom tweaks. I thoroughly tested Galaxy AI on the S25+ and it successfully completed every task exactly like the Ultra. I couldn't tell any difference in the speed or quality of the results."", 'Below are some highlights from testing:', 'Cross App Actions let you make complex requests using Google Gemini, the new default assistant. Normally, when you request information, it\'s up to you what you do with it. Gemini lets you request information and then take action in one request. For example, asking Gemini to ""Create a workout plan for a 45-year-old man and place it in Notes"" does exactly that. In testing, Gemini found the information online, organized it, created a note in Google Keep, and pasted in the information.', 'Natural language search in the Settings and the Gallery apps lets you find things by merely describing concepts. For example, you can go into Settings and search for ""I missed a notification"" using your voice or text. The Galaxy S25+ will bring you the Notification History option, which is otherwise accessible via Settings > Notifications > Advanced Settings > Notification History.', ""The Gallery search tool works in the same way. You can still search for general image types like screenshots or motion photos, but you can also ask for more specific things. I searched for pictures of statues, and the Gallery app found them. It didn't mix up humans for statues or vice versa, which is quite impressive."", 'Natural language search is separate from Gemini and uses Bixby on the backend. You can directly ask Bixby to find things in the Gallery app, but Bixby does not work exactly the same as searches in specific apps.', 'The Gallery app has some great offline capabilities in the S25 series. You can perform generative edits like removing or resizing items in photos, for instance. Best Face lets you replace faces in group photos as long as the original image is a motion photo; the final result is a still image.', 'Audio Eraser analyzes videos, categorizes the sounds, and lets you remix the audio in real time. It does a great job of removing wind noise, though it can struggle with overly loud background music.', 'In a test video, I played ""I Am the Walrus"" by the Beatles while talking. I used Audio Eraser to remove my voice from the video, then used the enhanced Circle to Search feature to identify the background song (it can now recognize music playing on your device). Sure enough, Circle to Search correctly identified the song.', 'Portrait Studio attempts to turn faces into works of art in several styles, such as comics, sketches, and watercolors. But as you can see below, it consistently got my skin tone incorrect and sometimes arguably changed my race.', ""Overall, most of these AI functions make the Galaxy S25+ easier to use. You don't need to learn how your phone works because you can talk to it like a person. It generally understands what you're trying to do. I especially appreciate how context-aware menus break from the rigid hierarchy of menus and nested options."", ""The Samsung Galaxy S25+ offers nearly everything that makes the Ultra great in a slightly smaller and more affordable package. Its design might be getting a little stale, but it's hard to find any real fault with it. Moreover, it has a gorgeous display, top-tier performance, good battery life, and powerful Galaxy AI features.

We were already impressed by the anti-reflective and scratch-resistant properties of the Gorilla Armor 1 featured on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display is on a whole new level. Take a look at this comparison photo shared by @theonecid on X to see the difference."", ""As you can see, the difference is night and day. Videos of the S25 Ultra also show that the display looks impossibly vibrant in bright light. It's bizarre that Samsung didn't show off this feature more, as it's something you will appreciate every time you use the phone, and sets it leagues apart from the competition."", ""On top of the S25 Ultra's anti-reflective properties, the display can survive drops up to 2.2. meters. While we would still recommend using a case, you can be more confident that the S25 Ultra will survive a drop than any other OEM's flagship Android phone. Gorilla Armor 2 is also exclusive to Galaxy S25 phones."", ""Another feature that Samsung ought to have advertised more was the Galaxy S25's speakers. It's hard to spot at a glance, but it's the S25 Ultra's speaker grille is larger than the S24 Ultra's."", ""Samsung hasn't explained why the S25 Ultra's speaker grille is bigger, or provided details on how it's improved the sound quality.

The S25 phones are the first Android devices to support Qualcomm's Snapdragon Satellite connectivity feature, but there's a catch.

There is some good news too, though not what we expected.', 'The Galaxy S24 Ultra outsold the S23 Ultra and was the most popular model of the 2024 generation.

Beaten only by the iPhone 14, which was essentially an iPhone 13 with some very minor upgrades.', ""It's getting to the point where I’m wondering whether my money would be better spent buying a Galaxy S24 Ultra instead."", 'When you look at the Galaxy S25 Ultra specs, and compare them to last year’s model, there isn’t a whole lot of what I’d consider “new” stuff. The screen is marginally bigger at 6.9-inches, and the chipset has been upgraded to a newer and faster model. There’s also a version of Qi2, though it relies on a specialist case if you want the magnetic benefits.', 'Really the only major hardware upgrade is the 50MP ultrawide camera. That’s a useful upgrade, even if it is long overdue, and it’s going to help the Galaxy S25 Ultra claim a position on our best camera phones page. But it’s not the kind of upgrade that makes buying a whole new phone worthwhile.', 'In fact there are a couple of places where the Galaxy S25 Ultra is either a downgrade compared to last year or still not on par with some of its main rivals.', 'The S Pen is proving to be the most infamous of these, with Samsung stripping out the Bluetooth functionality and related features from the stylus — claiming they weren’t popular enough to keep around. Samsung claims that a Bluetooth enabled pen will go on sale as a standalone product, but that feels like a price hike with extra steps.', 'Tom’s Guide Phones Editor John Velasco also pointed out that the loss of Air Gestures meant that the Galaxy S25’s desktop mode (DeX) isn’t nearly as useful this time around. So it’s no surprise that it hasn’t stopped a petition trying to return the decision from appearing.', 'Other notable omissions include any meaningful rise in wireless charging speeds, which is still stuck at 15W. The maximum amount of RAM available in the U.S. is also 12GB, despite rumors that a 16GB model could make an appearance. RAM is very important for on-device AI, and we’re seeing other Android flagships like the Pixel 9 Pro boost its memory up to 16GB.

AI in particular has been at the forefront of Samsung’s marketing, offering up a bunch of ways Galaxy AI is improving this year.', 'A big part of how Galaxy AI has changed involves the addition of AI agents, and multimodal capabilities that allow Galaxy AI to see and understand multiple kinds of input — including speech, text, images and video. All with the aim of making the process of communicating with AI more natural. It’s a big change for Samsung, even if these aren’t particularly unique capabilities.', 'For all the benefits Samsung has been lauding, it’s unclear whether these improvements are general upgrades to Galaxy AI — or features kept exclusively for the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung hasn’t been particularly clear on this point, and the last thing anyone wants is to pick up a new $1,300 phone only to find that all its best features are also available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra.', ""On the one hand Samsung does have the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which promises to offer greater performance and helps power more advanced on-device AI processing. But on the other hand, we've already seen that some features, like the Now Bar, are already available as part of the One UI 7 beta — meaning it's available (in some form) on the year-old Galaxy S24 Ultra as well. Likewise improvements to Circle to Search and other Google-made AI features are likely to make their way to Pixels and other Android phones in the coming weeks and months."", 'Not knowing what the future holds for Galaxy AI, and other software flourishes, makes me even more hesitant to take the plunge and pick up a Galaxy S25 Ultra. We don’t know what One UI 7 has in store for older Galaxy phones, and if last year is anything to go by we could see a bunch of new AI features and upgrades make their way to older phones.', 'Heck, even the Samsung Galaxy A35 supports some Galaxy AI features — and that’s $900 cheaper than the S25 Ultra. And bearing all that in mind, it has me seriously doubting whether the Galaxy S25 Ultra is worth it.', 'If you have an older phone, or maybe even a mid-range model then perhaps the S25 Ultra will be a worthwhile upgrade. There’s a lot on offer here, and while it does cost a lot, I have no doubt that the S25 Ultra will be one of the best phones you can buy. But that doesn’t change the fact that this is a very disappointing upgrade, and it feels like Samsung hasn’t tried that hard to give us a substantial upgrade.', 'Whether its downgrades to the S Pen, minimal extra hardware, or software that could easily come to older phones in the near future, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn’t really seem to have a unique selling point. Worse still the rounded design means that it’s lost its visual distinctiveness compared to other phones.', 'If you’re spending $1,300 on a brand new phone, the last thing you need is either the same thing as last year, or something that doesn’t stand out against the competition.

The 1TB variant is available in the US too, you can get it from Samsung.', 'The offer for the Samsung Galaxy S25+ is different. The 256GB model comes with a $100 gift card, so its effective price is $900. The 512GB model is $1,020, which is $100 less than MSRP (and only $20 more than the cost of a 256GB model, not including the promotional gift card).', 'The deal for the vanilla Samsung Galaxy S25 is structured the same way – get the base storage (128GB in this case) with a $100 gift card or pay a bit extra ($60 more) for the next storage tier (256GB, but you don’t get a gift card). For the S25+ we’d say you can live with the base storage, for the S25 we’d recommend you skip the gift card and get the storage upgrade.', 'Is the S25 series a bit... boring?

The battery is the same at 10,090mAh with 45W charging.', 'You can go smaller – and cheaper – with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, basically a 10.9” version of the FE+. The battery is smaller at 8,000mAh (but still supports 45W charging), everything else is the same.', 'And before we forget – the Tab S slates come with an S Pen (magnetically attached to their backs) with Bluetooth, air gestures and all. Funny how it’s possible on a $350 tablet, but not on a $1,300 phone.', 'We will wrap up with an oddball suggestion – Microsoft has created distilled versions of the DeepSeek R1 AI model that can run locally on Copilot+ PCs, starting with ones powered by the Snapdragon X chips.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Review,https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review,"['For many years, Samsung has typically been one of the first Android phone makers to deliver a hot new device with the latest Qualcomm chips at the start of the new year. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra ends up in an unenviable position in 2025, though, as it follows on the heels of the OnePlus 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9, all of which have shown solid advancements to their own product lines and just how capable the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may be the best that Samsung can do, but it really has to knock it out of the park to stay at the top of the smartphone class, especially when its $1,299 starting price is the highest of these four devices.', '', 'Samsung has made some of the most significant design changes for the Ultra line in several years with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and yet it still looks pretty same-y. The new design has curved corners and flat sides – a shift away from the angular corners and rounded sides of predecessors. But the Galaxy S25 Ulta remains a large slab. The back of the phone is largely featureless save for the three large and two small bumps for the camera array and laser auto-focus system.', 'While I can’t say the color isn’t pretty, it’s not jaw-dropping. OnePlus is out there etching wood grain into the back of its OnePlus 13, RedMagic is doing all sorts of bold craziness (including frost-like geometric patterns and see-through panels), and Samsung just has flat, muted colors. This is coming from the company that launched the S20 with a vibrant back panel that provided a close approximation to a bubble catching the sunlight. Sure, Samsung’s going with supposedly robust Gorilla Armor 2 glass on the front and back and titanium in the frame of the phone, but these lend little to the visual appeal of the device, and to my knowledge, none of them prevent the phone from shattering on concrete like any flagship phone out there.', 'The camera setup on the back of the S25 Ultra is also a curious and worrying choice. While the layout is familiar, each of the larger bumps now has a small relief at the bottom – think the pipes in Mario games. This might provide ever-so-slightly more visual intrigue, but the ability of these gaps to gather debris is all but guaranteed, and on the off chance something got under there with a little leverage, I’d expect some damage to the camera itself.', 'The one thing setting the S25 Ultra apart from its competition is the S Pen, which still has a little slot at the bottom edge of the phone. It tucks away conveniently, and springs out with a pleasing little pop. And it provides responsive stylus inputs for handwriting and doodling with far greater accuracy than a finger can manage. This year, Samsung took away the Bluetooth connection to the phone, which enabled some extra features, like the ability for the S Pen to serve as a remote camera shutter button though. I’m reminded of when Samsung dropped the SD card slot from its phones – sure, most people might have not been using it, but that didn’t make it any less convenient to have. And on that note, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that Samsung includes just a single SIM card in its tray. It supports two eSIMs, but more is always better in my book, and Samsung could have offered more.', 'Beyond the stylus and minor aesthetic choices, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is much like all the other flagship smartphones out there. It’s massive (6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in), weighty (218 grams), a little hard to use one-handed, and built well. You’ll get IP68-grade water and dust protection, which is about as good as it gets, though OnePlus went above and beyond this year by adding IP69 protection that can hold up against hot water jets as well as submersion.The anti-glare finish does a great job cutting down on reflections without impacting image quality from the display. Beyond that, though, the S25 Ultra’s screen isn’t blowing the competition out of the water.', 'Samsung fits in an excellent display. The screen stretches 6.9 inches across and has a sharp 1440x3120 resolution. The screen can reach a peak 120Hz refresh rate but can drop down as low as 1Hz to conserve energy. It’s bright and vibrant, making it a joy to watch shows and movies or play games on. The display is paired with potent speakers as well, which provide clear stereo audio and enough volume to listen to podcasts while tackling chores or taking a shower.', 'Samsung continues to situate a fingerprint scanner underneath the display, and it proves quick and reliable for unlocking the phone. Facial recognition is also supported.', 'The overall quality of the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn’t surprising. Samsung knows how to make a great phone, and this line is meant to be the cream of the crop. But it feels just a bit less special this year because it hasn’t done much to change from prior years while its competitors have. Sure, it has the S Pen, albeit somewhat neutered this year. Sure, it has Samsung DeX, giving it the ability to work like a portable computer, but that capability may not be far away from seeing broader availability on Android devices. And AI features are rolling out so fast and loose that none of them seem unique to any given phone, no matter how much Samsung hypes their capabilities.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is available widely online, at retailers, and at mobile carriers at a starting price of $1,299. It comes with 256GB of base storage and 12GB of memory. 512GB of storage bumps the price to $1,419 and 1TB of storage jumps up to $1,659. The phone comes in four main colors – Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver – as well as three Samsung online-exclusive colors: Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Pinkgold.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra launches with Android 15, and Samsung continues to promise seven years of Android OS and security updates, which is great to see from a device as expensive as this. Samsung still provides a flexible take on Android with its One UI, giving you plenty of tools to tailor it to the look and feel you prefer. While I haven’t found anything objectionable about Samsung’s approach to the operating system, I continue to be irked by Samsung’s attempts at locking down the ecosystem. Samsung has a handful of default apps that replace typical Google apps you’d find on almost any other Android phone, such as Chrome and Calendar. Samsung then uses its first-party apps to integrate some features, like its AI summarization of web pages or its ability to have AI check your calendar for events. If you want to take advantage of those features, you end up stuck with Samsung’s apps, and that can mean a big ecosystem shift.', 'While the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra may have a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip akin to that in other recent Android flagships, Samsung’s is a special version with souped up cores. It features six cores running at the same 3.53GHz as its competitors but two cores are boosted to 4.47GHz, up from the 4.32GHz you’d see in others like the OnePlus 13. It sounds like a minor difference, but it is enough to give Samsung a slight performance edge. In Geekbench 6’s single-core CPU test and Vulkan GPU test, the Galaxy S25 Ultra offered the fastest speeds I’ve seen from an Android phone. It edged out the OnePlus 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9 in these tests by as much as 6% and only fell to the ROG Phone 9 in the multi-core test by 0.27%.', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra also had impressive GPU performance results in 3DMark. But this is also where the cracks started to show. For one thing, it didn’t manage to jump ahead of the Asus, OnePlus, or RedMagic in these tests. In some cases, it was even a good ways behind, especially since RedMagic basically proved itself nearly magical with how much performance it could eke out of the GPU. But the bigger problem for Samsung was its ability to sustain.', 'Invariably, after one benchmark run, the performance of the S25 Ultra would throttle for subsequent runs, sometimes by upwards of 20%. Of the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered Android phones I tested recently, the S25 Ultra also performed the worst in the Steel Nomad Light stress test, which runs the benchmark 20 times in a row. In this stress test, the S25 Ultra started with a high of 2611 points but dropped promptly to 2116 points for the second run, then fell into the 1800s and eventually bottomed out at 1279 points. By contrast, the RedMagic 10 Pro and Asus ROG Phone 9 were both able to remain above 2150 points for all 20 runs. The OnePlus 13 also saw its results only sink as low as 1662 points. Samsung may be throttling more aggressively, with performance dipping even before the chipsets internal temps exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Samsung’s phone may stay cooler as a result, but all of these phones are getting uncomfortably hot by the end of the stress test. And I’ve noticed the S25 Ultra warming up simply while I’ve been browsing the web – something I didn’t notice from these other phones.', 'All this is to say the Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly performant phone, and it feels lightning fast in everyday operation. But it seems to struggle with heat, and its ability to serve as a top-tier gaming phone will be impacted by this. It will be a strong gaming phone for those who want to dip their toes from time to time, but it won’t be the supreme option.', 'The networking speed of the S25 Ultra at least doesn’t encounter compromises. I could see speeds over 400Mbps on T-Mobile’s networking in testing, and the phone supports Wi-Fi 7 for the latest Wi-Fi networks.', 'Battery life is solid, easily lasting through a day of heavy use or two days of moderate use. But the 5,000mAh battery isn’t all that impressive when the OnePlus 13 is packing in two 3,000mAh cells and the RedMagic 10 Pro has bumped up to 7,000mAh. Even the charging speeds Samsung offers are on the slow side with just 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging', 'Samsung was never going to fail to impress with the sheer specifications of its camera system on the Galaxy 25 Ultra. It packs a powerful array of sensors with a wide range of focal lengths. Here’s what you’ll find:', 'For all of its technical prowess, the Galaxy S25 Ultra camera system manages to still feel a bit bland. Perhaps this is because Samsung has a color filter system akin to Apple’s Photographic Styles. You can apply these while shooting or after the fact, but with the camera running at its defaults, I felt many of the photos I took simply lacked punchy contrast and vibrancy, not to mention the warmth I’d gotten used to on the OnePlus 13. The Galaxy S25 Ultra’s main sensor snaps very sharp, detailed photos, but there’s a difference between that and a photo that looks good.', 'The ultra-wide camera certainly helps squeeze a lot into the frame, but it does so at the cost of noticeable distortion. Looking at a series of ceiling photos I took, the equilateral hexagon pattern on the ceiling showed all-too-obvious elongation when snapped with the ultra-wide. Some textures exhibit sharpening artifacts that make them look slightly more processed than the main sensor, and this breaks down the consistency between the two sensors. In certain scenarios, such as extreme close ups, the S25 Ultra prompted me to use a focus assistance tool which actually swapped from the main sensor to a cropped view of the ultra-wide, and the result is a drop in quality – not what I’d want from a tool meant to be helpful.', 'Samsung has some strong zoom prowess here combining both a 10MP 3x sensor and 50MP 5x sensor. The 3x tightens in on subjects well while keeping them plenty sharp. The 3x sensor even proves sharper than cropping in on the 200MP main sensor. I’ve noticed some sudden shifts in how the camera system wants to handle lighting when switching between the main and 3x telephoto, though, and it again hinders the overall camera experience.', 'I love that Samsung includes a 5x optical sensor on the S25 Ultra. Though I don’t love it as much as the 10x it might have included. Going back to look at photos I took using the 10x sensor that was on the S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra, it doesn’t appear to me that Samsung has made meaningful improvement on its ability to get close to far-off subjects by switching to a 5x optical sensor and then cropping to get closer. The 5x optical sensor on the phone now does a good job getting close to the quality of the old 10x when zoomed in, but it would have just been that much neater to see it start at 10x and then have the potential to reach even farther out.', 'Now, as it stands, Samsung is still readily winning the telephoto war, as the 5x sensor here plainly beats the Google Pixel 9 Pro’s and the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s own 5x sensor. It’s day and night when comparing their ability to capture accurate detail on a far-off subject. This is perhaps the one edge the Galaxy S25 Ultra is keeping on the OnePlus 13 as well, as the latter phone doesn’t get much actual detail when zoomed in very far beyond 6x. OnePlus still has a knack for making an image that pleases the eye with bolder contrast and color on those super-zoomed photos, but Samsung’s ability to get actual detail is unrivaled here – too bad OnePlus didn’t borrow the Oppo Find X8 Pro’s 6x telephoto sensor.', 'The selfie camera on the phone is perfectly respectable, but just like its partners in this phone, it doesn’t dazzle. The selfie camera captured lifelike, if a little dry, colors and decent sharpness. OnePlus and Google just provide better looking selfies.', '', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is an incredibly versatile, elegant, and powerful phone. It should stand out as the best Samsung has to offer, but after years of iteration on this device and a price tag that sets it certainly above many of its competitors (except Apple), the Galaxy S25 Ultra frequently had me asking, “is this the best Samsung can do?” Samsung’s displays, once the best, now have little to stand out from the many excellent competitors. The phone’s performance may top the charts briefly, but quickly sinks below the competition in sustained usage. And even the technically impressive cameras fail to offer the character that might make them lovable. Samsung really needed near-perfection this year, and all it delivered was greatness.', '']"

More info.', 'The Galaxy S25 still hasn’t quite reached it’s official launch day (that’s later this week) and yet so many of us have had the device for an entire weekend already. On this quiet Monday, we thought we’d check-in and see how things are going so far.', 'For us at the DL, we have Tim well into testing his review unit of the Galaxy S25 Ultra and he should have thoughts for you before long in true review format. I’ve had the device in hand thanks to early pre-orders, so I’m essentially in the position of you. I spent a weekend with the device – my first Ultra in some time – and certainly have had time to process this massive device and whether or not I could see myself using it going forward.', 'In short, I’m not quite sure this is the phone for me. That’s not a surprising thing, though! You guys know how much I appreciate smaller phones and Google’s software, but I wanted to give the Ultra some time this year after not using one for several.', 'My biggest (personal) issue is that it’s just too damn big and sharp and squared off and not at all a phone that can be used with a single hand. It’s as if Samsung realized that flat-sided phones are cool, but they didn’t take Apple and Google’s ideas to make them also comfortable. Like, this phone is uncomfortable to hold because the glass-meeting-metal situation is rough. The Pixel 9 Pro and the iPhone (starting with the iPhone 15 Pro) brought out this tiny curve at the edges that keeps the flatness and dramatically improves comfort.', 'I’m not yet sold on battery life in early testing. I’m certainly aware that Samsung phones can take an extra amount of time to properly adjust to a user’s usage and so I’m not about to tell you where this is about to go. I’ll just say that over the weekend, I had a couple of nights where I plugged-in to make sure it made it until bed. I’m so used to my Pixel 9 Pro sitting at 40% as I drift off to sleep, yet this Galaxy S25 Ultra was in the 25% range hours before I went to bed.', '', 'One UI 7 has some nice UI changes and I think this is overall a pretty solid improvement in software from Samsung. You know how much I appreciate the return of the vertical app drawer, all of the customizations available in places like the lock screen, and the improved animations throughout. However, Samsung is doing some weird shit with notifications and how those stack now, plus I feel like I’ve had to dive deeper into settings more than usual to get things setup and running properly. Getting notifications to show on the lock screen, with content available for some apps, took me several days to get right. The new Quick Settings panel is quite awful when expanded, if I’m being brutally honest. I don’t know, guys, but this is a mixed bag of software.', 'On a brief camera note, I think this camera can take some exceptional pictures. I had some fun with portraits of my kid playing pinball this weekend. However, Samsung’s cameras still do that slow shutter thing where if an object moves for a split second, that everything turns to blur. Ehhhhh.', 'OK, I’ll stop complaining. I didn’t mean to complain this much.', 'Look, the display is huge and beautiful. Performance is very, very good and this phone is buttery smooth all of the time. This new One UI 7 skin is actually pretty robust in its feature set and I like most of it. This is a phone that I feel like I’m using 10% of because I know what it is capable of. That’s a cool thought! It makes you want to explore and try new things and see where it might take you. There are just some foundational elements to this phone that seem way off over these first few days. Oh yeah, AI is apparently here and I couldn’t tell you about any of it because it’s all pretty much small use-case, worthless stuff.

Best Buy also offers free gift cards if you prefer. The only difference is that the Galaxy S25 pre-order only gets you a $50 gift card, which is half the $100 gift card Amazon offers for pre-ordering the same device. Aside from the base model, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra included gift cards are for the same amounts.', 'We know picking the right Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphone can be challenging. These are all great, but they are made for different types of users. Let’s help you make up your mind!', 'The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best Sammy has to offer.

That’s quite a bit of cash, but at least you’ll get a $200 gift card you could use for extra accessories or anything else you need.', 'A high price comes with a premium experience. This device will be slowed down by nearly nothing. It comes with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB of RAM. You can also upgrade to 16GB of RAM in some markets.', 'You’ll get a fabulous set of specs across the board. The display is large at 6.9 inches, and it features a Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a QHD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Another benefit of this larger screen is that you’ll be able to really enjoy the S Pen, which adds a whole layer of interaction with your device. If you care for stylus input, this is the only device in the Galaxy S25 series that comes with an S Pen.', 'This model also has the most capable camera system in the Galaxy S25 series. The primary camera has a 200MP sensor, while the ultrawide and periscope shooters clock in at 50MP, and there’s another 10MP telephoto camera. We’ve yet to test these, but knowing Samsung, we’re almost sure this phone will make it to our list of the best camera phones.', 'This one comes with a 5,000mAh battery, which you can charge at 45W wired or 25W using Qi2 wireless charging. Of course, like all other devices on this list, the Galaxy S25 Ultra gets an industry-leading seven-year update promise.', 'Is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra a bit too much for your needs? We can agree that it is a bit overkill, and maybe something like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus offers a better balance between experience and price. We did mention that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus offered the best experience and price for most users last year, and while we can’t pass judgment quite yet, the same will likely be true with the Galaxy S25 Plus.', 'This device is $999.99.

Its battery is also smaller at 4,900mAh, and wireless charging is downgraded to 15W.', 'Otherwise, the phone is a high-end device. Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB of RAM, it still delivers amazing performance.', 'The obvious difference is that it will not come with an S Pen, but the device is fantastic if you can live without the stylus. It still gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12GB of RAM, so performance will be nearly as stunning. Of course, you still get that beloved seven-year update promise!', 'Most people ignore the lower-end models of the Galaxy S series, but I would personally pick this one. Not many of us need that much to be happy with a phone, and the simplicity of the Samsung Galaxy S25 may be more enticing to many of you.', 'For starters, this is a more pocketable handset, and many of us prefer smaller phones. It’s also much more affordable at $799.99; you all know how much I like saving money! Despite the smaller size and lower price point, the Galaxy S25 is still an awesome high-end smartphone.', 'Performance won’t be hindered, as this model still carries a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12 GB of RAM. It’s just as powerful as the rest.', 'The display is smaller at 6.2 inches and is the only model with a Full HD resolution. That said, the Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel will still look fabulous and keep the 120HZ refresh rate.', 'The camera system is the same as the one you’ll find in the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. It does, however, have a smaller 4,000mAh battery, and charging speeds are reduced to 25W wired and 15W wireless.', 'Otherwise, the design, performance, and general high-end experience are nice to have at a lower price point.

Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus Review: Just Enough AI to Not Make Me Go Crazy,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-review-just-enough-ai-to-not-make-me-go-crazy/,"['', '', '', '', '', ""Samsung's new phones are loaded with AI, but the good cameras and long battery life remain the true standout features."", '', 'Samsung\'s mantra when debuting the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus appears to have been, ""If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it,"" as this year\'s phones share a striking resemblance to last year\'s S24 and S24 Plus. But what the new phones lack in innovation, they make up for in consistency and practicality. ', 'AI upgrades are the biggest factors separating the S25 and S25 Plus from their predecessors. While I found myself warming up to (most of) these features after using the phones for a week, there are other time-tested attributes that remain more important to me – namely, cameras and battery life.', ""For instance, there's a new tool called AI Select that looks at your phone's screen and suggests actions like summarizing or translating text, the Gallery app can find a picture you're looking for with more conversational search terms and Audio Eraser can clean up distracting background noises in your videos. "", ""Google's Gemini has been further baked into the Galaxy's interface and can be summoned with a long press of the side power button to answer questions and carry out tasks as your assistant."", ""At a time when major phone releases are as high-stakes as ever, Samsung tries to set the $800 Galaxy S25 and $1,000 Galaxy S25 Plus apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And I am definitely impressed. "", 'The S25 and S25 Plus have matte glass backs that add a premium touch.', ""So what's the difference between the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus? Not much. Other than the Plus being, well, bigger than the baseline model."", ""The phones both have AMOLED displays with 120Hz adaptive refresh rates, with the S25's measuring 6.2 inches and the S25 Plus clocking in at 6.7 inches. At 162 and 190 grams respectively, the S25 and S25 Plus feel light in hand, thanks to their aluminum frames. The screens are covered in Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the matte glass backs offer an elegant touch and premium feel. "", ""I hesitantly dunked the S25 Plus into a shallow pool at Filoli Historic House & Garden near San Francisco during testing and am happy to report it survived unscathed. This shouldn't come as a surprise, since both the S25 and S25 Plus have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning they can survive being submerged for 30 minutes being under 1.5 meters of water (or about 5 feet)."", ""The camera bumps don't jut out too much on the S25 and S25 Plus, which is nice. "", ""The phones come in navy, icy blue, mint and silver shadow, as well as the online-exclusive colors blue black, coral red and pink gold. I absolutely adore the icy blue color of the S25 I've been using, and the Plus I have in navy also looks nice and rich."", ""The S25 and S25 Plus arrive with Android 15 and Samsung's One UI 7. And similar to the Pixel 9 series, you'll get seven years of OS and security updates, helping you get the most bang for your buck (and there's certainly a lot of buck involved here). The phones are powered by a custom-built Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, helping to bring those many, many AI features to life."", 'Gemini and I, surprisingly, became friends.', ""I'm not alone in feeling severe AI fatigue. As someone who tends to be AI-averse (do I really need it to write my emails, brainstorm ideas or summarize a PDF?), I tend to be wary of AI-heavy announcements like the one Samsung had at its Galaxy Unpacked event in January."", 'Once I got my hands on the devices, I put my skepticism aside and was surprised. ', 'After a few days, I found myself leaning on Gemini for help with everything from tweaking email settings (this was faster than Googling and reading), caring for my wood cutting board, and finding events and sending corresponding texts via a single voice command. ', ""Ultimately, it's the AI features that operate discreetly that won me over, like Circle to Search. This is a Google-powered feature that came out last year and lets you circle anything on your screen to quickly see product information and links. Now, Circle to Search can recognize a song playing in the background of a video or even a tune you hum or sing, and I had a lot of fun testing this out. When I hummed niche Taylor Swift songs like I Hate It Here and Foolish One, it nailed both. (Step aside, Shazam.) To be fair, I'm not sure how often I'll use this particular aspect of Circle to Search, but the tool as a whole remains impressive. "", 'The AI Select tool also served me well, but primarily for translating text. My Spanish vocab has (sadly) gotten rusty since high school. So when I came across an email in Spanish, I tapped the tool on the right-hand side of the screen, circled the text I wanted to translate and within a couple taps, it was quickly transformed into English (and hopefully, accurately). ', 'Here are two Portrait Studio images of me entirely created by AI.', ""Not all AI features are a home run, though. Portrait Studio, which uses AI to create stylized portraits (kind of like caricatures an artist might sketch of you at the beach or on a boardwalk), is fun to play with but feels like a novelty. It did an admittedly great job replicating details like my hijab, eye shape and smile. But I'm not sure how useful a tool like this is in the long run. Similarly, Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into different stylized illustrations, is impressive at transforming my crappy drawings into pleasing images. I don't have any real use for this tool, as I'm not going to be framing these random images of cats and flowers. "", ""The biggest disappointment, so far, has been the Now Brief. This is designed to learn your habits – like if you usually check the weather, read the news and consult your calendar each morning – then surface any relevant suggestions to simplify those routines. In the week I used these phones, the only time I was even slightly impressed with this feature was when it showed a highlight of the images I'd taken that day. But otherwise, Now Brief simply lists the weather, my events that day and articles that are irrelevant 90% of the time. That's not to say it won't eventually learn more about me and get better, but it hasn't proven its value just yet."", 'The S25 and S25 Plus have a trio of lenses on the back: wide, ultrawide and 3x telephoto.', ""The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus share the same camera specs as last year's series: a 50-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera. They also both share a 12-megapixel front-facing camera. So you'll get the same kinds of images on both the S25 and S25 Plus."", ""I've always admired the punchy colors in Galaxy S photos, and the S25 and S25 Plus were no exception. Here are a few of my favorite shots."", ""This is one of the best examples of how each shade of color, from pale pinks to vibrant reds, pop. There's so much texture in this image below, from the ripples on the water to the droplets on the petals, and the background maintains just enough detail and color without robbing the spotlight."", 'Bright colors shine on the S25 and S25 Plus. ', ""Portrait mode on the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus is perhaps the most impressive I've seen, as it does the best job of knowing what to keep in sharp focus and what to blur. Even in this picture below of my (dying) tulips, each leaf and petal remains clearly in the foreground and isn't lost to background blur. "", 'These wilting flowers may not look very pristine, but at least the overall shot does.', ""Portrait mode isn't perfect, of course, as some of the many branches in this shot do get the undesired blur effect. But it's such a minor detail that hopefully all you'll notice is how well the flowers on the table pop."", 'I love how commanding the subject is in Portrait shots.', 'The improvements over previous Galaxy S devices come in the form of – yes, AI. Generative Edit debuted on the S24 series, but is now processed on device, allowing you to quickly and easily remove photobombers or objects cluttering your image. I tried this out with both people and objects and was blown away each time. Generative Edit did a seamless job filling in backgrounds (sometimes even generating new graffiti patterns, as seen below when I removed a railing).', ""There's a rail on the right..."", ""And now there's not!"", 'One downside, though an upside for transparency, is that there\'s a label on images that have benefitted from Generative Edit disclosing that this is ""AI-generated content."" I understand the importance of this, especially as AI gets better at fooling people, but object removal features are nothing new to photography.', 'Before and after. Notice the AI disclaimer at the bottom of the image to the right.', ""Samsung introduced a Virtual Aperture tool that mimics a standalone camera's f-stops, using the separate Expert RAW app. If you're a pro photographer, I can see this being a cool feature to have. But as someone who likes things plain and simple, I'm going to stick with the camera's built-in Portrait mode so that factors like background blur and lighting are sorted out for me. "", 'Another AI-related boost comes in the form of nighttime videos. I was impressed with how rich the dark sky looks in videos I recorded and with how smooth the motion appears as I panned the camera. Daytime videos also looked solid.', 'Photos at night were splendid, with rich contrast and saturation.', 'The S25 beautifully handled the combination of vibrant greens, dark shadows and bright holiday lights (which are still up for some reason).', 'Night mode also did a great job of brightening up this image to almost make it look as if it were taken in the daytime, and not at 7 p.m.', 'This night time shot almost looks as if it were taken in the daytime. ', 'Selfies maintain the smoothing effect I so love on Galaxy S phones, while maintaining vibrancy and crispness in the foreground and background. ', ""And let's flip that camera around real quick for a selfie. "", 'Remarkably, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus have a great battery life, which is important since both feature power-hungry AI features.', 'Battery capacity is one of the few factors separating the phones, with the S25 sporting a 4,000-mAh battery and the Plus packing a 4,900-mAh battery.', ""Both phones lasted about a day and a half with regular use. In CNET's 45-minute endurance test, which involves a combination of streaming, scrolling through social media, joining a video call and playing games, the S25's battery dropped from full to 93% (the same as last year's S24), while the battery on the S25 Plus dropped to 94%. "", 'In a longer, 3-hour streaming test over Wi-Fi, in which I watched a YouTube video in full-screen mode at full brightness, the S25 dropped from 100% to 85%, while the S25 Plus dropped to 86%.', 'Higher percentages are better.', ""The S25 supports 25-watt charging, while the S25 Plus supports 45-watt charging. In a 30-minute test using a 30-watt charger, the S25 went from 0% to 47%, and reached 100% in 80 minutes. In the same test using a 45-watt charger, the S25 Plus went from 0% to 63% in 30 minutes, and reached a full charge in 70 minutes. For comparison, in last year's test, the S24 went from 0% to 51% in 30 minutes, and the S24 Plus went from 0% to 50%."", ""The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus also support 15-watt wireless charging, which is the same as what you'll get with Qi2. You can use Samsung's own case with the Qi2 magnetic profile or a compatible third-party case to tap into those wireless capabilities."", ""Benchmark tests for the CPU in Geekbench 6 place the S25 and S25 Plus well above the entire Galaxy S24 lineup. In a graphics test using 3D Mark's Wild Life Extreme, the S25 and S25 Plus exceeded the performance of the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S24 and S24 Ultra."", 'Check out the graphs below for more specifics.', ""The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus have lots of AI but aren't entirely defined by it."", ""Perhaps the highest praise I can give to a phone in 2025 is that there was just enough AI to not make me go crazy. The S25 and S25 Plus have their fair share of AI-powered features, but for the most part, there are only several that I can see myself willingly using. Others like Portrait Studio and Drawing Assist may be fun for keynote demos, but don't seem to serve a real purpose beyond that. (But it wouldn't be a Galaxy phone without a flashy feature no one uses, right??)"", 'Thankfully, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus continue to deliver on what, to me, makes the Galaxy S series notable: good cameras, solid battery life and a seamless interface. ', ""Because there are so many similarities between the S25 and S25 Plus, and the higher battery capacity on the Plus didn't result in any startling differences (although superfast charging is great), I'd personally save some money and just go with the baseline S25. If you want a bigger phone, it might be worth going a full step up with the S25 Ultra, so you could take advantage of added perks like that 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, but that costs $500 more than the regular S25. Still, the S25 and S25 Plus share many similarities with the Ultra, including Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB RAM and AI features, so you'll be getting a relatively good value from that baseline model."", ""If you have a Galaxy S22 or older, switching to the S25 or S25 Plus could be a significant upgrade. If you have an S23, you can benefit from improved battery life and dip your toes into Samsung's newer AI waters. But if you're rocking an S24, there's no reason to pay for relatively modest upgrades."", 'Ultimately, the S25 and S25 are much of the same as what we\'ve seen before. But that isn\'t such a bad thing, when ""the same"" largely still does the trick.', ""Every phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates."", 'All the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.', ""We take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.""]"
