But shouldn‚Äôt we be looking for something more than mere entertainment?', 'Beginning in 1979, the NASCAR Cup Series season kicked off with a non-championship event known as the Clash. At the time, the event was seen as a way to bring race fans into Daytona for Speedweeks, or, the several week period where endurance racing and stock car racing swapped the stage.', 'In an era of unreliability, the Clash was a great way for the NASCAR field to get warmed up for the year. As reliability improved, fan loyalties turned the Clash into a can‚Äôt-miss event, one that filled grandstands in and of itself.', 'But as the 2020s got underway, teams grew concerned about the amount of money they were throwing away to compete in a non-points-paying race, and series executives started to toy with the format.', 'First, the event was moved from the Daytona International Speedway oval to the infield road course. Then, the Clash headed out to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ‚Äî a small venue that received much of the same criticism as that I‚Äôm about to levy, albeit with the added bonus of drawing a whole new audience into the sport.', 'This year, NASCAR moved the Clash to Bowman Gray Stadium, one of the legacy oval tracks that defined the early years of the Cup Series. The small nature of the track required four heat races to set the field, with a contentious Last Chance Qualifier completing the lineup ahead of the main event.', 'Chase Elliott won both his heat race as well as the main event, allowing the fan favorite driver to take home his first-ever Clash victory. But beyond that, Sunday‚Äôs racing was characterized by reckless driving and lots of wrecks. Many fans, unsure of what to make of the whole affair, decided that, at the very least, the wrecks made for some captivating entertainment.', 'üëâ NASCAR lawsuit: All the allegations of monopoly-like behavior against the Cup Series', 'üëâ NASCAR Playoffs explained: Format, rules, tracks, and schedule', 'But shouldn‚Äôt entertainment be just one of the many factors against which we evaluate a race in 2025?', 'All forms of sport, be it racing or something like football, seek to find the ideal balance between sporting integrity and entertainment. Fans need to tune into these events, to go out of their way to attend them ‚Äî but with events like the Clash, that entertainment is beginning to conflict with the integrity of NASCAR, and the goals of the series.', 'Over the past several years, NASCAR has pushed itself to evolve, adding street circuits or international races to its calendar while balancing out its growth by trying to cut developmental costs ‚Äî and it has been exceptionally promising.', 'A race on the streets of Chicago proved that NASCAR Cup Series racing can transcend the oval format and engage new audiences, while the implementation of the Next-Gen car was hailed as being as good for teams‚Äô pocketbooks as it has been for drawing in international talent like Shane van Gisbergen.', 'But the Clash at Bowman Gray flew in the face of those goals. As drivers collided with each other and bit the wall for an event that is of no direct consequence to the 2025 championship, it was difficult not to wonder how much the repair bill would be, and what value any of the teams were getting from any of this.', 'The location itself gave cause for concern. The Cup Series stopped turning up at the quarter-mile Bowman Gray Stadium all the way back in 1971 because its cars had outgrown the oval, and the problem of size popped up again and again during the Clash as drivers fought for purchase ‚Äî generally by simply knocking a competitor out of the way.', 'While drivers like Ryan Blaney, Kyle Larson, and Chase Elliott all displayed legitimate and considered race craft when it came to positioning their cars and overtaking other drivers, most of the rest of the field relied on bumper shoves and late braking to mount a move, and it generally resulted in chaos.', 'The Clash was entertaining, at least in the most basic sense that a lot of drama happened, and a lot of cars wrecked. But the whole event felt like a bastardization of the ethos driving modern NASCAR and forced a certain level of cognitive dissonance.', 'To enjoy the wrecks in the Last Chance Qualifier, it was necessary to ignore that many of the cars in the event were there because they‚Äôre fielded by smaller-budget teams, and that those teams will find it more challenging to afford a slew of repairs ‚Äî an especially daunting task considering the Cup Series‚Äô crown jewel race, the Daytona 500, is on the horizon.', 'Entertainment is important in racing, yes, but defining entertainment as ‚Äúlots of wrecks‚Äù does a disservice to the drivers, teams, and fans invested in the growth and evolution of NASCAR.', 'Read next: Explained: NASCAR Cup Series points and championship format', '', '', '', '', '¬© Planet Sport Limited 2025 ‚Ä¢ All Rights Reserved']"

', 'Bowman Gray Stadium was still a short track, and it was similar to Martinsville. As a matter of fact, drivers used the same tire as Martinsville.', 'Here‚Äôs this week NASCAR‚Äôs power rankings, based on a mix of performance at Bowman Gray and how a driver should perform this year.', '1. Ryan Blaney (Last Week: 3)', 'He didn‚Äôt win the Clash, but his run might have been the most impressive, as he went from last (23rd) to second over the 200-lap race. And the Penske driver did it without making enemies.', '2. Chase Elliott (LW: 6)', 'The sport‚Äôs most popular driver opened 2025 by delighting his fans with the victory at Bowman Gray. The Hendrick driver wasn‚Äôt just good in the main event; he was good in practice, qualifying and the heat race, too. ', '3. Joey Logano (LW: 7)', 'Logano finished fourth at the Clash, which was a solid start to defending his title. All three Penske cars finished in the top seven, and affiliate car Josh Berry placed 13th, an indication this track fell in the Penske wheelhouse. ', '4. Christopher Bell (LW: 1)', 'On the other side of the spectrum, only one Joe Gibbs Racing driver finished in the top 10. Bell finished second in his heat but ended up 12th in the main event.', '5. Kyle Larson (LW: 2)', 'Larson was impressive in winning the last-chance qualifier, a race he probably didn‚Äôt expect to run but was relegated to after a spin in his heat. The main event was a challenge, as Larson was 17th, partially because his Hendrick car was turned with 85 laps remaining.', '6. Denny Hamlin (LW: 10)', 'Hamlin was terrible at the start of the weekend and improved throughout to finish third. Making those gains during the race weekend could be a sign that the crew chief change at JGR won‚Äôt hinder his performance.', '7. Tyler Reddick (LW: 5)', ""Reddick won his heat and looked strong early in the main event before losing the handle of his car and settling for eighth. Not a bad finish, but more was expected considering the 23XI Racing driver's strong start to the weekend."", '8. William Byron (LW: 4)', 'Byron had a pretty forgettable weekend. He started 11th, got turned with 85 laps to go (the same time as his HMS teammate Larson) and never recovered to finish 18th. Now he heads to Daytona, where he‚Äôs the defending Daytona 500 winner.', '9. Brad Keselowski (LW: 8)', 'Keselowski finished second in his heat and was having a solid run until being turned with 80 laps remaining. That turned out to be the final caution of the day. The RFK Racing driver never got back on the lead lap and finished 21st.', '10. Bubba Wallace (LW: NR) ', 'A more than respectable fifth-place finish for Wallace in his first event with new 23XI Racing crew chief Charles Denike. For starting where he did at 14th, Wallace could leave Bowman Gray with a smile.', 'Dropped out: Alex Bowman (LW: 9)', 'On the verge: Alex Bowman, Chase Briscoe, Chris Buescher, Kyle Busch, Ross Chastain, Austin Cindric', 'Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

And Bell said aside from the Chili Bowl ‚Äî the dirt midget race held in an indoor venue in Oklahoma ‚Äî there are not many places where drivers can tell what the crowd is doing. At every other NASCAR track, fans are much further back from the racing surface than old-school Bowman Gray (which normally doesn‚Äôt even have a catch fence for its weekly Saturday night shows but had one installed in time for the Clash).', 'So Bell said he ‚Äúvery vividly‚Äù noticed his big fan in the front row, a man who would fist-pump for the Joe Gibbs Racing driver while flipping off the competition as they drove by.', '', 'And really, that‚Äôs what the magic of Bowman Gray was all about. With a 17,000-seat capacity, even the fully jammed grandstands represented the smallest crowd in decades for a NASCAR Cup Series race ‚Äî but had probably the highest number of middle fingers.', 'The percentage of fans who were extremely into the race made ‚ÄúThe Madhouse‚Äù come alive. This wasn‚Äôt a race for casuals; it was a true return to the roots at a track the Cup Series last visited in 1971.', 'So now what?', 'The Athletic‚Äôs Jordan Bianchi will explore more about where the Clash could go next in a story coming Tuesday, but there are two main schools of thought on what the race should be.', 'Many drivers loved the idea of replicating what NASCAR did at Bowman Gray and taking that concept to other short tracks in need of a boost. Bowman Gray now has a state-of-the-art lighting system and modern safety barriers (rather than metal guardrails, as traditional as those may have been). The Clash also exposed the historic track to a national audience and could get fans excited to visit for one of its weekly races.', 'Could that be repeated at beloved tracks like Hickory (North Carolina) or New Smyrna (Florida)? It could rotate every year, providing an investment into the grassroots along the way.', 'Then again, the previous three Clash events were held inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ‚Äî with a much different vibe. That was truly about using an exhibition race to expand NASCAR‚Äôs fan base by going right into a big city and trying to attract a new audience.', 'In that vein, perhaps using the Clash to go international (Brazil? Europe?) or to other major markets without a NASCAR track (Seattle?) could be an appropriate purpose for a preseason event.', '‚ÄúThey took a facility here that‚Äôs been around for a long time and made it feel like a brand-new one,‚Äù Denny Hamlin said. ‚ÄúThe fans obviously were very, very excited to see us. They were enthusiastic. We feed into that. It felt like a big event.', '', '‚ÄúYou want to go wherever can give you that feel and atmosphere. There‚Äôs surely bigger venues and bigger cities to go to, but will you have this type of feel or not? That‚Äôs really what matters.‚Äù', 'What doesn‚Äôt need to happen? The consensus in the garage was NASCAR cannot afford to overstay its welcome anywhere. Year 1 of the L.A. Coliseum experiment was incredible and full of enthusiasm, Year 2 was cool but not quite as awe-inspiring, and Year 3 was flat.', 'If NASCAR wants to come back to Bowman Gray for another Clash in 2026, the garage talk was it should be the last one before moving it somewhere else.', 'Perhaps the biggest surprise of the Clash weekend was how ‚Äúracy‚Äù the track was for the Next Gen cars.', 'Though the heat races were physical and full contact with desperate drivers eager to qualify for the main event, the actual 200-lap Clash itself had a nice mix of aggression and simply good ol‚Äô short-track racing.', '‚ÄúI was pretty negative going into it,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt excited about it. And after experiencing it, if the drivers do their job and race respectfully, it‚Äôs awesome. The first 100 laps, I felt like I was able to move forward and make passes. Granted, I was having to run into the back of people a little bit and give them a nudge. But I felt like it was respectful. If people minded their Ps and Qs, it was doable.‚Äù', 'There were four lead changes in the race despite Chase Elliott‚Äôs domination, and passing was clearly possible based on Ryan Blaney going from 23rd to second over the 200 laps.', '‚ÄúIt went better than I thought it could possibly go,‚Äù Joey Logano said.', 'As discussed last week, NASCAR recently decided not to change the playoff format for 2025 with an eye on taking a deep dive into the possibility for 2026 instead.', 'Drivers are split on what they‚Äôd like to see happen. Some were vocally in favor of keeping the current format (even Bell, despite his gut-wrenching exclusion from the Championship 4 last year) while others want some sort of change.', '', 'But no matter where they fell on the spectrum of what specifically could be done, the general acknowledgment was NASCAR has to get this right.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an extremely important decision,‚Äù Elliott said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a more important decision we can make in just how we crown our champion every year and making sure we‚Äôre not ever doing that the wrong way or taking away from what that means. Long-term, whatever decision they want to make, I just want to make sure ‚Ä¶ these prestigious moments are always prestigious.‚Äù', 'The PGA Tour recently shut down its ‚ÄúPlayer Impact Program,‚Äù which incentivized golfers to publicize the tour by boosting their engagement with fans and media. And when we say ‚Äúincentivize,‚Äù we actually mean ‚Äúpay them truckloads of money‚Äù ‚Äî to the tune of $50 million split among 10 golfers last year.', 'NASCAR isn‚Äôt offering that much, but its new ‚ÄúDriver Ambassador Program‚Äù modeled after the PGA concept is now in full swing. Several million dollars are said to be at stake for drivers.', 'Drivers earn one point for every 15 minutes of their time doing something considered ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù (such as media interviews or appearances at tracks) outside of the mandatory sessions (postrace news conferences, etc.) or traveling to events. And depending on a driver‚Äôs star power, which is determined by a formula, they earn multipliers on those points (up to five times multiplied for the top five stars).', 'Whoever earns the most points gets the most money from the DAP fund, but the payouts go down the list in an attempt to get drivers motivated to do more on behalf of promoting the sport. So when Elliott and Bubba Wallace recently flew to Chicago for the day to visit Barstool Sports, they racked up a bunch of points for their time and moved up in the overall standings.', 'Via an app, drivers and their representatives can view requests (and the amount of points they‚Äôd earn) or submit time for media interviews or fan events they booked on their own. There‚Äôs even a live leaderboard anyone with access to the program can pull up (Joey Logano was leading the standings as of Sunday).', '', 'In the short term, this will hopefully result in drivers being willing to do more to put themselves out there. But what happens when the program inevitably ends at some point, as it did after four years in the PGA? The previous generation, with the likes of Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., often spoke openly about ‚Äúgrowing the sport‚Äù with their brands and did so much to boost NASCAR without necessarily being compensated for it. Five years from now, will drivers say they‚Äôll only agree to promote NASCAR unless they‚Äôre getting paid?', 'GO DEEPER', 'Five NASCAR questions to be answered in 2025: How many can you get right?', 'There were rave reviews for a concept NASCAR implemented for the first time at the Clash: Off-site technical inspection.', 'With such a small footprint at Bowman Gray Stadium, NASCAR decided to hold its pre-race inspection at Charlotte Motor Speedway (approximately one hour from the track and close to where most of the teams have their race shops). NASCAR officials then put seals on the cars to make sure nothing was being messed with and the cars stayed inside the haulers until being unloaded in Winston-Salem on Saturday afternoon.', 'Crew members loved it. It was even suggested the concept could be a model for future races in the Charlotte area, perhaps a North Wilkesboro or even Martinsville or Bristol. Taking it a step further, one idea floated was even to hold inspections at NASCAR‚Äôs Research and Development center in nearby Concord, with assigned times for each team to show up (thus reducing the need for crew members to arrive a day early and stand in a long inspection line at the track).', 'NASCAR was pleased with the positive reception but officials would need to evaluate whether it could be helpful at other races. There are always unintended consequences, after all, and teams might try to do some funny business NASCAR doesn‚Äôt like if they were allowed to do off-site inspection and then take the cars down the road.', 'So before the inspection away from the track would be tried again, NASCAR would likely get a group of crew chiefs together and ask them to lay out ways to safeguard the process.

Does NASCAR Clash win for Chase Elliott mean anything long term? Just maybe. Here's why.,https://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/articles/138962/nascar-clash-win-chase-elliott-hendrick-motorsports-cup-series,"['', 'CONCORD, N.C. - Historically speaking, one could get in trouble pretty quickly trying to draw some sort of correlation between a win in the Clash and overall success in the NASCAR Cup Series the same season. ', ""Sure, there are exceptions. Since the event's inaugural run in 1979, the driver who won the Clash went on to win the ensuing DAYTONA 500 six times. On eight occasions, the Clash winner eventually claimed a season championship in the same year. "", 'Only once has a driver won the Clash, the DAYTONA 500 and the points title - Hendrick Motorsports vice chairman Jeff Gordon in 1997. It was one of a pair of Clash wins for Gordon whose first win as the driver of the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet came in the preseason opener in 1994. ', 'Even after turning in the most dominating performance in Clash history this past weekend at Bowman Gray Stadium, winning all three practice sessions in which he took part, the pole and then leading 171 of 200 laps en route to victory, Chase Elliott kept it in perspective while fielding postrace questions. ', '""I mean, look, I know it\'s not a points race, but I don\'t care. These things, man, they are so hard to win,"" Elliott said. ""This garage has become so competitive, these guys are so good at what they do, it\'s very rewarding to cross the finish line first in whatever type of event it is when you\'re racing against those types of drivers and teams.', '""That to me is very enjoyable from our perspective. We\'ll take the positives from the weekend. For sure we recognize there\'s 37 more to go. There\'s a lot of racing left. Just hope we can build on this.""', '', '', 'The word, ""build"" is an incredibly pertinent one in Elliott\'s situation. ', ""One reason Elliott's victory on Sunday could well be a harbinger of things to come in 2025 is because it only continued the trajectory the team has been on for quite some time, dating back into 2024. And that trend took an even sharper upward turn later in the season as Elliott pushed for a Championship 4 berth, only to come up one spot short at Martinsville Speedway in the season's penultimate race. "", 'But Elliott led 129 laps in that event, a week after leading 81 circuits at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Those 210 laps paced, made up 48.7% of his laps led on the season, including a win at Texas Motor Speedway. ', 'So, obviously, the team was surging as the year came to a close and Sunday seemed to signal that Elliott, crew chief Alan Gustafson and the No. 9 bunch may be poised to pick up right where they left off. ', '""I thought last year was a really good step for us to getting back to the form we want to be in, and that\'s winning championships and being in the Final 4,"" Gustafson said. ""I think as long as you\'re moving forward and continuously improving, if you can do that, you\'re going to get where you want to be. I felt like last year that was the case. We got better from the previous year, kind of got better throughout the whole season.""', ""Also, important to note in Elliott's case is the venue. From 1979-2020, the Clash was held on the big track at Daytona International Speedway, a place where upset winners routinely reign supreme. "", 'That changed when the Clash went to the Daytona Road Course in 2021 and even more so in 2022 when it changed venues and coastlines, heading to the Los Angeles Coliseum for a three-year stint on a quarter-mile short track. ', 'The oval on Sunday at Bowman Gray was certainly closer to the Coliseum than Daytona, though, despite their matching lengths, drivers insisted there were plenty of differences between the two. But more importantly, Bowman Gray is also at least somewhat similar to a few other tracks on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule, most notably Martinsville and Phoenix Raceway, that last two stops on the slate with the latter hosting the Championship 4 race. ', '', '', 'The last two years, Ryan Blaney and Joey Logano have each won a championship at Phoenix with Blaney sweeping the past two fall events at Martinsville. Again, on Sunday, Blaney charged to the front of the field but this time, could do nothing with Elliott, who held him off down the stretch for the win. ', ""There's a long season ahead and certainly, Sunday's results don't mean that come late October and early November, things will play out the same way. But Sunday's result can't be completely dismissed either and if Elliott and the No. 9 bunch go on to have a big 2025, the Clash may just be remembered as an early message to the rest of the field. "", '‚ÄúGrip is grip,‚Äù Gordon said. ‚ÄúThose guys really had something special and you could see the car was working well. Chase I thought was doing a great job managing the tires and the balance and I just thought all the way around it was a good weekend for the No. 9 team in a big way. I don‚Äôt know how much of that transfers over to anything else but if they can find one, tiny ounce, they‚Äôll take it.‚Äù ', '""I think it\'s just some validation to we all tried to come here and win, we all tried to come here and be successful, and we were able to,"" Gustafson added. ""Gives you validation in your process, validation in how your team is operating and working. Certainly, I think it\'s going to give Chase some confidence and validation seeing he did an amazing job to win the race. Basically, did everything right.""']"

""It was fun for me at least. We\'ll hopefully come back here one day.""', 'This was the first Cup event weekend in 53 years at the football stadium that doubles as a storied racetrack. And it provided NASCAR a nice throwback to its roots for its annual preseason exhibition race. NASCAR‚Äôs previous experiment for the event, building a racetrack inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, had run its course after three years.', 'So NASCAR took the Clash to a track where Cup cars once raced and one that still enjoys a healthy spring and summer schedule of racing featuring NASCAR‚Äôs modified division. Known for its wild and raucous ‚Äî and sometimes pugilistic ‚Äî nights of racing, the track affectionately known as ""The Madhouse"" got a facelift from NASCAR. The league owns the promotional rights for racing at the publicly owned stadium.', 'About 40 percent of the 17,000 seats were sold to locals and the rest to fans who wanted to see Cup cars trying to navigate on what is essentially your standard quarter-mile running track. NASCAR had to add energy-absorbing walls, a new catchfence and new lights to meet its Cup standards. But the event certainly had that Saturday night racing feel, albeit on a Sunday night.', ""Fans stood up lap after lap, just as they would for other races at the track. Josh Berry advanced from the last-chance qualifier with a car that had to be repaired with specialized racing tape after all the damage it sustained in the event. The drivers showed tempers, although they didn't overflow into any fisticuffs or need for bail money."", '""I‚Äôm looking forward to hopefully coming back next year,"" said Ryan Blaney, who started 23rd in the 23-car main event and finished second. ""I don\'t see why you wouldn\'t come back.""', 'While both the LA Memorial Coliseum and Bowman Gray were both quarter-mile tracks, the Bowman Gray track was completely flat and also had some imperfections as far as the wall. In order to keep the authenticity of the track, the new steel-absorbing wall included areas that jutted into the upper groove in the turns, just as the old guardrail that had to be replaced to accommodate the Cup cars.', '""I just feel like if we\'re going to race on a football field, this is probably as good of a place as any to do it,"" Elliott said as he sat in the postrace news conference, which is normally the weight room for Winston-Salem State University, where the stadium is located.', ""By going to an existing track rather than the temporary one in Los Angeles, the drivers could race on a worn surface instead of on a freshly paved one. When tracks are freshly paved, the racing typically isn't quite as good."", '""[The track] just seemed bigger to me,"" Elliott said. ""I don\'t know what the technical distance would be, how different it is or not. The straightaways seemed a little longer, the corners weren\'t so sharp, it didn\'t seem like it was such a sharp apex.

Tim Brown, a 12-time track champion, was greeting fans at one of the area‚Äôs most famous hot dog joints the day before getting on the track.', 'Burt Myers, an 11-time champion, got wrecked out of the last-chance qualifier and still couldn‚Äôt help but smile after exiting the care center.', '""The lights, the walls, the whole facility, the infield, everything the way it looks, it brought it to a Cup level,"" Myers said.', '""To see them do that to my little home track here in Winston-Salem was heartwarming on my end.""', 'Myers is used to racing in front of solid crowds at the track during the summer. For the Cup drivers, a crowd of close to 20,000 will likely be the smallest of the season.', 'So does NASCAR do this somewhere else and potentially help another facility? It potentially could have agreements where, instead of the track pocketing the money that it would get from the television contract for the event, NASCAR spends that money on upgrades.', 'There has also been consideration of making this race an international event.', 'And, especially after a successful (albeit a little cold) race Sunday night, there will be increased chatter about making a return to Bowman Gray.', '""There\'s going to be just as many people here next year as there was tonight,"" Blaney said.

At least in the short term.', '""It looks good, the energy is real,"" Logano said. ""It\'s not like you have this ginormous stadium and you get half or three quarters of it full. It‚Äôs standing room only, it\'s a special feel, it\'s hard to get the ticket.', '""People want what they can\'t have, right? In the same breath, I would say it\'s very important for us to move things around. We seen the success of our sport moving to new racetracks. I\'m a big fan of going to new race tracks.""', 'Elliott stressed the importance, though, of going to facilities where every fan seems to be into it.', '""Probably the biggest lesson I\'ve taken from the weekend is kind of reaffirming my belief in less is more,"" Elliott said. ""Like this crowd. It wasn\'t 80,000, 90,000, but it was a smaller number. A more intimate number.""', ""When Elliott wins a race, though, the crowd seems bigger since he is the sport‚Äôs most popular driver. Blaney even joked a little that there was only one way for him to pass Elliott for the win, and he didn't dare do it."", '""I\'m not going to bulldog into him and get chased out of here with pitchforks,"" Blaney said.', 'Drivers rarely show restraint at Bowman Gray. The fans come to see drivers occasionally dump another.

There were no confrontations like last year‚Äôs All-Star race ‚Äî North Wilkesboro Speedway presents the same bullring sorta deal that breeds contempt and racing moments ‚Äî but there was plenty of action on the racetrack nonetheless, a day that ended with the sport‚Äôs most popular driver, Chase Elliott, earning the first Clash victory of his career.', 'Still, come a mere 30 minutes after the checkered flag, drivers were asked to weigh in on 2026:', 'Should NASCAR return to the same venue, for the same event, at the same time a year from now?', 'Some, like second-place finisher Ryan Blaney, were swift with a ‚Äúyes,‚Äù adding that there will be ‚Äújust as many people here next year as there was tonight.‚Äù Others, like his Team Penske teammate and 2024 champion Joey Logano, had mixed feelings.', '‚ÄúFrom what I hear, they pack this place out every weekend without the star power of Cup guys.

Bowman Gray Stadium, after all, is the quarter-mile track home to the 100th Cup win of Richard Petty; the football field-turned-racing heaven that hosted so many Cup moments before the series left in 1971 and didn‚Äôt return until Sunday; the racetrack that hosts weekly races that regularly draws tens of thousands of attendees.', 'But he also realizes that thinking ahead is important.', '‚ÄúCertainly I don‚Äôt want to say this wasn‚Äôt good enough,‚Äù Hamlin said. ‚ÄúThey took a facility here that‚Äôs been around for a long time and made it feel like a brand-new one.

All told, the model has nailed a whopping 18 winners since 2021, including nine in 2023 and three in the first seven races last season. Anyone who followed its lead on betting apps and sportsbooks on those NASCAR picks could have seen huge returns."", 'Now, the model simulated the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray 2025 10,000 times. Head to SportsLine to see the complete projected NASCAR at Winston-Salem leaderboard.', ""For the 2025 Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray, we can tell you the model is high on Tyler Reddick, even though he's a longshot at +650 in the latest 2025 NASCAR at Bowman Gray odds. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. A two-time NASCAR Xfinity Series champion, Reddick made the NASCAR Cup Series Championship for the first time in 2024 but ultimately finished fourth in the NASCAR standings despite a sixth-place finish in Phoenix."", ""However, Reddick has now piled up eight victories over the last three seasons and he's one of only 13 active drivers with a top-five finish in the Clash on his resume. As 23XI Racing continues to push for its first NASCAR Cup Series championship, the team is hoping to find more success on short tracks in 2025 and the model believes that Reddick can push towards the front on the quarter-mile oval at Bowman Gray."", 'And a massive shocker: Chase Briscoe stumbles big-time and barely cracks the top 10. There are far better values in the 2025 NASCAR Clash at Bowman Gray starting lineup. Briscoe was way out of the NASCAR postseason picture before he stole a spot in the playoffs with a win in Darlington during the last week of the regular season. The victory earned Briscoe his second career entry into the NASCAR playoffs.', ""However, a 38th-place finish in Atlanta put him in a big hole and he was eliminated from title contention after the first round of the playoffs despite top-10 finishes in his next two races. Briscoe went on to finish outside the top 10 in his next seven starts and he's finished 22nd, 15th and seventh in three career Clash starts. See which other drivers to avoid and the rest of the projected NASCAR leaderboard at SportsLine."", ""The model is also targeting two drivers with NASCAR odds longer than 15-1 to make a serious run at the checkered flag. Anyone who backs these drivers could hit it big.

What drivers said after Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium,https://www.nbcsports.com/nascar/news/what-drivers-said-after-clash-at-bowman-gray-stadium,"['WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. ‚Äî Here is what drivers had to say after Sunday night‚Äôs Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium.', 'Chase Elliott ‚Äî Winner: ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not a points race, but it is nice to win, for sure. Just really proud of our team for just continuing to keep our heads down and push forward, for sure.', '‚ÄúHad a tough race. Ryan (Blaney) kept me honest there at the end. Denny (Hamlin) was really good at the second half of that break. I just felt like he was kind of riding, and I was afraid to lose control of the race and not be able to get it back. Yeah, fortunately it worked out. Great way to start the season.', '""‚Ä¶ Honestly, felt like there at the end of the first hundred that Denny and Tyler (Reddick) had gotten better than us, and we needed to be a good bit improved to track those guys back down. Was kind of afraid if we lost control, it was going to be hard to get it back. (Crew chief Alan Gustafson) made some good adjustments there at the break. We were able to get back to second. I felt like I needed to take my shot and try to get the lead. If it worked out, great. If Denny got me back, then so be it. I just felt like my best chance to win was to try to get control of the race in that moment. Took that opportunity and was fortunate enough to kind of have the race play out in our favor. Certainly Ryan kept us honest there at the end, too.‚Äù', '', 'Ryan Blaney ‚Äî Finished 2nd: ‚ÄúThat was fun. That was a blast. The car was really good, especially the first half and the second half. Being able to get to second, then race hard with Chase there, who‚Äôs going to save more tire. I just didn‚Äôt quite have enough right rear at the end to make a move on him. ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a fun time. I hope the fans enjoyed it. That was a really good show. Happy we could come to Bowman Gray and put on a great race for everybody.', '', 'Denny Hamlin ‚Äî Finished 3rd: ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt do very well on that restart there, and kind of lost the bottom and Chase (Elliott) took advantage of it. Once you get the lead, it is a lot easier to hang on to it. I thought that they were just a little better that second half than we were, along with the 12 (Ryan Blaney) was as well. We just have to get a little bit better, but overall, a good day for our Sport Clips Toyota.‚Äù', '', '', '', 'Bubba Wallace ‚Äî Finished 5th: ‚ÄúI hate that I got into the 6 (Brad Keselowski). I didn‚Äôt want to get a top-five finish that way. He was doing everything he could to get down ‚Äì and I got greedy and wanted to fill the hole. I really didn‚Äôt think I hit him that hard, but obviously I did, so apologize for that. A good day ‚Äì I wish I had the hard charger award. The 12 (Ryan Blaney) beat me for that. I looked in the mirror, before the break, and he is two back and I‚Äôm like, he‚Äôs fast. But all-in-all, a good day for our Leidos Toyota Camry. We start off the season with a top-five. Does that count? We will count it. All-in-all, a good day ‚Äì we were still missing it on something. This tire was also from Martinsville in the fall. I didn‚Äôt like the car then. I don‚Äôt like the car now, but you have to fight for it. I need to look back on what I need to do better with this tire. I think it is more me than the car ‚Äì just getting the potential, but all-in-all, it was a fun night. Crowd was loud and proud, and it was a good time.‚Äù', '', 'Ross Chastain ‚Äî Finished 6th: ‚ÄúWell we were in the race, but we weren‚Äôt up front. For us to lead the way with a sixth-place finish was our strongest showing of the weekend and we ended the best that we were all weekend, so that‚Äôs promising. But we need more speed. We were proud last night driving home that we locked-in all three cars, but we want to do it up front.‚Äù', '', 'Austin Cindric ‚Äî Finished 7th: ‚ÄúI thought we did a good job of making our Freightliner Ford Mustang Dark Horse better from Saturday night and even from the first 100 laps to the second 100 laps. I can‚Äôt really complain. I thought we had speed to race in the top five. We made a lot of passes under green on that long run and felt like we had a reasonable car and kept the tires under it. These quarter mile events have been a struggle for me the last four years, so it‚Äôs really good progress and a solid showing to start the season for the 2 car.‚Äù', 'Tyler Reddick ‚Äî Finished 8th: ‚ÄúAfter we had all those restarts up top there and we finally got going, my car, the handling was just not quite the same. It got really, really tight. It just put me in a bad spot there. Really slow and not pointed where I needed to be and people were able to get to my bumper. ‚Ä¶ It never really recovered to where it was in the first half of the race, unfortunately.‚Äù', '', 'Shane van Gisbergen ‚Äî Finished 9th: ‚ÄúYeah, it was a lot of fun. I think I still put myself in bad spots and got moved out of the way. And then, I didn‚Äôt know how to get back down without making people mad. But yeah, I had a lot of fun.‚Äù', 'Chris Buescher ‚Äî Finished 10th: ‚ÄúWe put ourselves in a good position there at the start of the race by winning our heat yesterday, and overall, I thought the car was solid. I‚Äôm really proud of our guys and their effort, and we‚Äôll look to carry this momentum into Daytona weekend.‚Äù', '', 'Ryan Preece ‚Äî Finished 11th: ‚ÄúWe made gains on the break. I think we were running 20th and struggling to be there, and made good adjustments and got ourselves back to 11th. We didn‚Äôt really have any other opportunities to go forward, so at the end of the day I‚Äôm happy with positive changes and just ready to move forward to the Duels (at Daytona) and the big show.‚Äù', '', 'Josh Berry ‚Äî Finished 13th: ‚ÄúIt was a lot of fun. I thought the guys did a really good job making the car better and adjusting on it from practice and the heat races to give me a really good car for the feature. Honestly, I felt like we had some more potential there if things would have went a little different, but, overall, I‚Äôm really happy with it. Obviously, the goal is to come here and make the race, so to do that and get a decent finish in our first time out it was a lot of fun.‚Äù', 'Kyle Busch ‚Äî Finished 15th: ‚ÄúThe overall event at Bowman Gray Stadium was a good one, but it wasn‚Äôt the result we wanted for our zone Chevrolet team. At the start of the feature, the car was plowing tight and wouldn‚Äôt turn. We got spun around and ended up going two laps down before the halfway break. (Crew chief) Randall (Burnett) and the No. 8 guys made adjustments during the break, and when we went back green, it was the best the car had felt. It was doing what it needed to do. With the help of a couple cautions, we got back on the lead lap and worked our way up to 15th at the checkered.‚Äù', '', 'Brad Keselowski ‚Äî Finished 21st: ‚ÄúWe showed a lot of potential early on, but we got spun there with 75 to go and really never had a chance to recover. We were solid. Just a fifth-to-10th-place car the whole day. We tried to get a little bit more but overall, a good debut outing for a team that‚Äôs had a lot of changes.‚Äù', '', 'Daniel Suarez ‚Äî Finished 22nd: It was a little tricky tonight for the No. 99 Freeway Insurance Chevy team. I thought we were going to have a little more speed. We were decent in the short run, but not too good in the long run, which was the opposite of how I thought we were going to be. Overall, it was a good event.‚Äù', 'A Division of NBCUniversal.', 'DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Richard Petty recorded his 100th race win at Bowman Gray in 1969. Junior Johnson, David Pearson, along with the Allisons and Earnhardts, all once raced at Bowman Gray.', ""For the longest time, NASCAR was hardly a sport that returned to things it had once moved away from. The quest has been to find ways to evolve, whether through competing in new markets, schedule changes, championship format changes or different versions of the race car itself. It's a monumental moment to bring the Cup Series back to Bowman Gray Stadium."", '""I do like that we\'re at home at Bowman Gray,"" Team Penske\'s Austin Cindric said. ""When I think of downtown Los Angeles, I don\'t think of short-track racing. When I think of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, it\'s a lot closer to short-track racing. I do think the fan base is very passionate at that place and will definitely appreciate having Cup cars there, maybe more than anywhere else. I can\'t wait to see that. I can\'t wait to see the turnout.""', 'The turnout will also be noticeable on the racetrack. During the three years NASCAR spent in Los Angeles at the Coliseum, the entry list consisted of the 36 charter teams required to make the cross-country trip and compete. Bowman Gray has an entry list of 39.', 'North Carolina is considered the home of NASCAR and where many of its teams and drivers are based. Starting the season at home and at a track beloved by many has resonated within the industry.', 'In the three years the Clash was held in L.A., the racing was decent but secondary as entertainment took center stage with musical acts, celebrities and athletes appearing. The feel is set to be different this weekend, and it should be because this could be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some.', '""As much as it is an exhibition race, anybody that says they don\'t want to win at Bowman Gray is lying,"" Ryan Preece of RFK Racing said. ""Winning in general, you want to do, but Bowman Gray, the history that\'s behind it, you look back at some of the names and adding your name to that list of the Cup Series going and winning at Bowman Gray. That\'s where NASCAR was pretty much born, so it would be pretty special to go and do that, and what better way than to kick it off here in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.""']"
