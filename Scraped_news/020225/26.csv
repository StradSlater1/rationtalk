With the Honda Prologue riding on GM’s versatile Ultium EV platform—the same foundation used by the Chevrolet Blazer EV, GMC Hummer, and Cadillac Lyriq—the Japanese automaker is now charting its homegrown electrified course. Enter the “0” subbrand, Honda’s next-gen EV lineup set to debut next year with the Lambo-like 0 Saloon and the more traditional but futuristic 0 SUV. At CES, Honda unveiled prototypes of these groundbreaking models, and if history is any guide, these near-production designs are likely what we’ll see hitting the streets.', 'After CES, we had the chance to visit Honda’s North American headquarters in Los Angeles for a closer look at the show cars. Inside the studio, we explored their cabins and learned more about the designs during a walkaround with Jonathon Rivers, who leads Honda’s creative services team. Here’s a look at some of the standout features and key details we discovered.', 'See All 8 Photos', 'The first question we asked Rivers is who they think is going to buy the 0 Saloon. A Lamborghini-shaped electric Honda isn’t going to be the most attractive model for the masses, and in order to make EVs profitable, people need to buy them in big numbers. But Rivers wasn’t shy to answer our question.', ""“When you look around, especially here in Southern California, and you see all kinds of interesting trucks these days and designs, it's clear that there are people that want that kind of interesting shape and styling and design,” he said. “But for us, it's really the positioning. When we call this the flagship, I mean, clearly, it's not necessarily a sports car, but being the top of the pinnacle of the 0 Series, we wanted it to be a statement piece. I think we pulled that off, especially as you just take in the side profile, right?”"", 'As Rivers noted, it has the shape of a sports car but isn’t really a sports car; he told us us the 0 Saloon will be sort of playing in its own league. Although the entire 0 Series subbrand will be more premium and tech-forward than the current EVs Honda has, the automaker is planning to reach a new kind of customer, someone who might have not considered a Honda before but likes the appeal and technology of the 0 Series.', ""“[The 0 Series] allows us to reach into different segments, different buyer types, right? Where we don't have to be confined to just efficient, stylish, and fun-to-drive kind of mainstream vehicles,” Rivers said. “But with the 0 Series line of EV products, it allows us to stretch and to reach new heights and bring in a lot of new customers.”"", 'We’ll have to wait to see if it’s up to the standards of a base Tesla Model S or Lucid Air, or even, say, an Acura in terms of perceived prestige.', 'See All 8 Photos', 'Honda is aiming to be the world’s first automaker to offer Level 3 autonomous driving on every road type and every driving situation. Level 3 means hands-free, pedals-free, and eyes-off-the-road driving, though you can’t be napping. While Honda isn’t saying much at this time, Rivers did say Honda is targeting the system to work mostly on expressways, followed by traffic jam situations. But with over-the-air updates, the automaker plans to quickly expand access to other roads and parts of the country.', 'Mercedes-Benz already offers Level 3 technology on the new S-Class via Drive Pilot, but the technology has a 40-mph top speed and only works on certain portions of highways in California and Nevada, so its everyday usability is limited. Honda wants to offer something more advanced than that, though no details have been provided.', ""“We're still determining what level of software and what level of functionality will be available,” Rivers said. “So stay tuned for that because that could change as we get closer to launch.” He added Honda is looking at every type of sensor technology; expect to see a combination of lidar, radar, and camera-based hardware."", 'Honda is also partnering with Helm.AI for its AI technology, but don’t expect it to be a ChatGPT-like experience. Helm.AI is a driver assistant technology that will learn the behavior models of experienced drivers, and Honda expects the system to “respond quickly and appropriately to unexpected situations, such as an animal darting into the lane or an object falling onto the road.”', 'See All 8 Photos', 'The Saloon is still in concept form, and things can change between now and the start of production, but we noticed it isn’t very easy to get into the back seat. Because of the low roof and the way the seat is positioned, it wasn’t like other Honda vehicles, which are easy to get in and out of. However, once you’re back there, there’s a ton of legroom and headroom. Because the seat is close to the ground, our knees are higher than in other Hondas.', 'The 0 SUV has a more traditional cabin setup, and there’s plenty of space in the first and second row. Cargo area doesn’t seem as expansive as other Hondas, but we’ll have to wait until the production models come out to get our full judgement on this.', 'See All 8 Photos', 'As part of the premium features that Honda is putting into the 0 lineup, there is a new operating system dubbed ASIMO OS, which was developed in-house. It will be the central system to the whole vehicle, taking over ECUs and essentially becoming the heart of the entire car. It will be equipped with the latest hardware and software technology, and it will be able to receive over-the-air updates.', 'We look forward to reporting more on the 0 lineup as we get closer to the launch date next year.', '', '', 'Miguel Cortina is Mexico Editor at MotorTrend, covering the auto industry in the U.S. and south of the border.

Honda's radical new EVs might help it make better Accords,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1145651_honda-s-radical-new-evs-might-help-it-make-better-accords,"['Over the past several years, a roller coaster of EV supply and market demand, with an about-face of regulatory moves, created a new kind of challenge for full-line automakers—about how deeply and how soon to commit to dedicated EV plants. ', 'Honda continues to target 100% electric vehicle sales by 2040, and to have “zero environmental impact” by 2050. It’s previously projected 40% EV sales in North America by 2030. Meanwhile hybrids add up to 50% of U.S. Honda Accord and CR-V sales, and in recent months Honda has admitted that it’s hard to predict the trajectory of where the mix will be on the way to fully electric. ', 'To reconcile all this, it’s prepared by committing to a new template for making both EVs and gasoline models on the same production line. This sea change in how it makes vehicles could keep its oldest U.S. assembly plant—its Marysville, Ohio, facility that opened in 1982—humming at capacity, no matter what the market presents.', 'As Honda confirmed last April, Marysville will truly get the automaker to the point of EV mass production in North America, with a big asterisk. It has the capability to make hundreds of EVs per day, or many hundreds of gasoline models—depending on demand.', 'Sign up to get the latest green car and environmental news, delivered to your inbox daily!', 'I agree to receive emails from Green Car Reports. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy.', 'Marysville is one of four facilities set to make up what Honda is calling its Ohio EV Hub—including the Anna Engine Plant and East Liberty Auto Plant, all within 50 miles of each other, and a joint-venture battery plant between Honda and LG Energy solution in nearby Jeffersonville, Ohio. Battery plant aside, Honda says it encompasses more than a $1 billion investment in the three facilities, in redesigning the manufacturing process around being able to make ICE, hybrid, and EV models all on the same production line. ', 'The investment in the Ohio facilities marks the global debut of changes in the way it builds vehicles, with expertise set to be shared across North America. And, according to Honda, it’s aiming to set a global standard for Honda EV production. ', '', '', '', 'Honda is set to start EV production in late 2025 at the Ohio EV Hub, beginning with the Acura RSX EV. Honda-branded EVs based on the Honda 0 SUV and Honda 0 Saloon prototypes will arrive soon after, both in 2026. ', 'That’s three models. There will also be a fourth model set to ramp up around the same time as those two Honda models: the Afeela 1, the Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) product of a joint venture between Sony and Honda. SHM confirmed last month at CES in Las Vegas that deliveries of the $89,900 Afeela 1 will start in mid-2026. ', '', 'Afeela 1', 'At Marysville last week, Green Car Reports got to see this great change underway. Honda opted to combine its two assembly lines into a single flexible assembly plant concept. The project has been three years in the making behind the scenes, and Honda announced the project specific to the plant in March 2023. ', 'The plant previously made the Acura Integra and TLX on one line, while the Accord was made on the other. Without interrupting the production flow (and temporarily moving Accord production at one point), that involved a series of transitions, with the added space allowing a much wider line, with a new sub-assembly strategy allowing for processes that EVs require and gas models don’t—and vice versa. ', '', 'Honda Accord assembly at Marysville', 'Mike Fischer, the leader for Honda’s North American EV project, explained to GCR that this transformation of Ohio facilities is probably the single most important foundation for Honda manufacturing moving forward, because it shows how Honda can maintain not just production flexibility but flexibility for engineering and design. BEV and ICE vehicles can remain optimized for their respective strengths, and neither one will be hobbled for it on the manufacturing floor.  ', 'Honda is keeping the overall build time exactly the same after the line change, according to Fischer, who led the production launch of the 2013 Accord. That model required some changes at the plant due to its extensive engineering changes like a strut layout, CVT automatic, and available hybrid versions. The upcoming BEV models and their subassemblies will take “a little bit” more build time than the current Accord, he said, adding that there’s still opportunity for optimization and it should be the same or maybe a little less.', 'Sign up to get the latest green car and environmental news, delivered to your inbox daily!', 'I agree to receive emails from Green Car Reports. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy.', 'Meanwhile, it’s picking up the pace on that one line such that total output from the plant could potentially reach the previous peak production of about 950 vehicles a day, or an annual capacity of 220,000 from two lines. ', 'It was no easy task. The upcoming EVs, which we previewed in October with a Honda 0 Series prototype drive, are set to have very little in common with gas models, and they’re going to be fundamentally different for many years. Honda has no plans to merge body structures or vehicle platforms among its gasoline and hybrid models. ', '', 'Honda 0 Series battery cases', ""From the concept-car proportions to the next-gen Asimo OS interface, to all-new switchgear and displays, to the calibration needs of their Level 3 automated driving system, and everything underneath, it’s seriously hard to find commonalities between the 0 Series and Honda's ICE models—or the GM-based Honda Prologue EV now at dealerships. While the Accord’s structure is primarily steel, the EVs will be built on an aluminum-focused body structure, with the aluminum battery pack an integral piece. They were designed with different priorities—so as to have short overhangs and efficient cabins, with the force paths designed with no allowance for an engine in front, eliminating the need for high cowl crossmembers and sending force paths to thick side rails. "", 'So Honda created a series of sub-assembly lines that could handle all the differences in the way an EV is assembled versus the way a gasoline or hybrid vehicle is assembled—and widened the way for those sub-assemblies and for parts and components to get through. ', 'Honda had to upgrade its vehicle carriers for heavier EVs, redesigned its people-movers along the line for better ergonomics, and had to devise robots that would apply thermal gap filler to the pack on the vehicle line. It also had to design a process for battery pack assembly itself—including the installation of cells from the nearby Honda-LG battery plant—and for battery pack installation into the vehicle (below). ', 'For the body structures of the new EVs, Honda is switching to a CDC weld technology—a world first, employing pulses rather than a constant current to help make a lighter, stronger structure. If you expect fireworks of sparks at welding stations, it feels uneventful.', '', 'Honda Accords going through inspection - Marysville OH', 'ICE and hybrid vehicles pass through the EV battery pack area without stopping, while EVs may pass through some of the steps for elements like exhaust and fuel-system installation without stopping. Honda calls it “multi-platform flexibility.” And to keep the rate of Accord Hybrid production running strong, Honda also created a new area for hybrid battery assembly. ', 'LG pouch cells fill the modules that get installed into the EVs’ battery packs on the Marysville line, as we saw demonstrated, but Honda hasn’t yet confirmed the battery capacity. The pack is kept thin by Honda’s unusual and innovative cooling strategy—with water jackets machined into the pack case itself, allowing super-thin channels of coolant to circulate between that and a jacket cover that fits over it. ', '', '', '', 'Meanwhile, the packs themselves are set to be made less than an hour’s drive away, at Honda’s Anna Engine Plant, where it’s taking on a similar challenge: manufacturing some of the key components for the 0 Series’ battery pack and powertrain without interrupting its throughput for the range of engines—including Atkinson-cycle four-cylinders for the Accord Hybrid. ', 'Honda has made about 30 million engines at Anna, and it has the production capacity to make more than 4,800 of them per day. Electric motors for the EVs, engineered by Honda but built by captive supplier Hitachi Astemo at present, are likely to be brought into Anna eventually, executives said. ', 'With six 31-foot-tall, 6,000-ton die-cast machines at Anna, Honda will “megacast” the battery-pack cases set to go into EVs at both Marysville and East Liberty. As Honda underscores, it’s larger than anything it’s ever die-cast. ', 'Megacasting uses less energy than gigacasting, and the die-cast process reduces scrap, eliminates the need for heat treating, and enables Honda to shift the energy used in the process from gas to electricity—reducing the CO2 footprint. ', 'In Honda’s EVs, the pack is split into a front and rear section, with a friction stir welding process—strongly joining the two pieces without melting—bonding the “butt joint” between the two sections. ', ""The cases serve as part of the structure of the EVs, so prior to machining, it's extremely important to make sure they're dimensionally in check—and, given the shape, that they've stayed flat. So Honda has put to use a new “photogrammetry” method potentially employing more than 100 cameras that rapidly take a series of photos of the part, reconciling all the recorded geometries. "", '', 'Honda Accord Hybrid component assembly - Marysville, Ohio', 'As Fischer suggested from an engineering standpoint, the meticulous look at how these vehicles are being built meant more than EVs on the same line plus updated machines and new robotics. It will benefit future gasoline, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles in a multitude of ways.', 'Tim Leopold, the BEV project lead for the Marysville plant, said that it’s brought in more of a “big data” approach to production starting with the EV Hub remake, that extends to EVs and gasoline models alike. It brought in a layered quality approach that’s so extensive it connects everything from the torque feedback of the tools used to tighten bolts to things like the dimensional accuracy of the bodies and how components fit together. ', '“We can either trace or track it with data, and control it to the point of an interlock where that particular unit won’t be able to pass downstream unless we get a system saying, it’s OK, I’ve received good data,” Leopold explained. “We’re using the EVs as an opportunity for change, but at the same time that change is going to help the ICE or hybrid counterpart, which is pretty exciting.”', '', 'Honda 0 Series prototype and battery pack marriage - Ohio EV Hub', 'Leopold said that Marysville is only about a month away from making so-called “trial production” versions of the first EVs, after which—with lots of analysis along the way—it will go through multiple iterations over the next 10 to 11 months leading to mass production. ', ""This market-dependent, flexible, lift-all-boats approach is a necessary piece for remaining competitive over the next 12 to 15 years. At some point, it may simply become a question of when to retire the gasoline models. We aren't there yet."", 'Now it’s a matter of proving the idea out in real-world manufacturing—a project that the team behind it feels very confident in taking around the globe. ', '“I can translate this, shift it to any of our manufacturing body plant operations,” Fischer said. “How to do ICE, hybrid, and BEV in general, together…It created the perfect storm for us to be able to do this at two facilities from the start, and then it will go wider.”', 'Sign up to get the latest green car and environmental news, delivered to your inbox daily!', 'I agree to receive emails from Green Car Reports.

They remain important amid threats of potential increases in tariffs for imported products such as automobiles by President Donald Trump.', 'Honda produced more than 1 million vehicles at five U.S. assembly plants in 2024. About 64% percent were sold in the U.S., while the remainder were exported. It has one assembly plant in Mexico.', 'Once completed, Honda will be able to produce roughly 220,000 vehicles annually at its Marysville plant, located in central Ohio outside of Columbus. The 4 million-square-foot facility currently produces several Honda and Acura vehicles, which are expected to be joined later this year by an all-electric Acura RSX crossover — the first EV produced by Honda.', 'The Japanese automaker was late to invest in EVs compared with other automakers. It currently sells two all-electric crossovers — Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX — in the U.S., but those vehicles are produced by General Motors\nin Mexico.', 'The new Acura crossover will be followed by the Honda 0 SUV and Honda 0 Saloon EV prototypes the company debuted last month at CES in Las Vegas.', 'The aluminum battery packs for the new EVs will be produced at Honda’s nearby engine complex in Anna, Ohio — the company’s largest engine facility globally that has grown from a small rectangle building in 1985 to a more than 2.8-million-square feet plant.', '“We’re establishing this large aluminum production technology for all Honda,” Tim Stroh, EV battery case project leader, said. “The goal here is to roll that out to other products, other factors across the world.”', 'To produce the battery packs and other EV components, as well as potentially engines in the future, the company is installing six massive, 6,000-ton high-pressure die cast machines that will “megacast,” or “gigacast” materials, as Tesla has referred to it. The massive machines are the size of a small house and use an enormous amount of pressure to form parts. Current Honda presses go up to 3,500 tons in Ohio.', 'Done correctly, gigacasting can theoretically slash per-unit manufacturing costs by eliminating the welding of dozens of body parts by casting one single module, according to S&P Global Mobility.', 'Once the packs are cast, they will be shipped from Anna to Marysville and other plants to have battery cells from Honda’s joint venture operations with LG Energy Solution installed before being used in the final assembly of EVs.', 'To combine the battery cells and packs in Marysville, Honda is installing nearly 60 flexible manufacturing “cells,” or zones, for the battery assembly.

"Honda’s EV strategy ‘scattershot’, expert says, after cars revealed at CES",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/auto-shows/article-hondas-ev-strategy-scattershot-expert-says-after-cars-revealed-at-ces/,"['The Honda 0 Saloon on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, on Jan. 7.\nPETRINA GENTILE/THE GLOBE AND MAIL', '', 'Looking at three cars unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January that received the most buzz, it’s hard not to wonder about Honda’s electric vehicle strategy.', 'Is it trying to make affordable EVs for the masses? Or futuristic, higher-priced ones? Is it trying to go alone or looking for partners?', 'Despite its “scattershot” strategy, an expert says Honda’s strong brand will give it an edge with whatever it brings to market.', 'Back in April, 2022, Honda partnered with General Motors to share the cost of developing a new EV. Together, they co-developed Honda’s first all-electric SUV, the Honda Prologue, which shares its platform with the electric Chevrolet Blazer. But that partnership, which was meant to produce millions of affordable EVs by 2027, ended in October, 2023.', 'Fast forward to CES this year, where Honda unveiled two new EV prototypes under its next-generation 0 Series – the 0 Saloon and the 0 SUV. At the same venue, Honda also revealed a production-ready electric Afeela 1 sedan, a joint venture with electronics giant Sony that falls under the Sony Honda Mobility umbrella. The Afeela 1 will initially be sold in California for nearly US$90,000.', 'CEO Yasuhide Mizuno of Sony Honda Mobility Inc. speaks about the Afeela 1 EV, on Jan. 6.\nJOHN LOCHER/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS', 'The Honda 0 SUV on display at the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, on Jan. 7.\nPETRINA GENTILE/THE GLOBE AND MAIL', '“A lot of folks are questioning what is Honda thinking and why are they going down that road? Sony is obviously a strong brand when it comes to electronics and entertainment and yet the vehicle they came up with doesn’t look terribly entertaining. It doesn’t seem to break any grounds from a technology standpoint,” says Adam Bernard, a long-time General Motors director and now principal of AutoPerspectives, a consultancy firm based in Detroit.', 'While Honda didn’t differentiate between what’s shared and what’s unique on the 0 Series prototypes versus the Afeela 1, the 0 Series appears to have more advanced vehicle technology including smaller drive units, a flat battery and Level 3 autonomous driving.', '“There [are] a lot of really interesting ideas [in the 0 Series] and then the Afeela doesn’t seem to be anything new or interesting. Yet the price tag is more expensive than a Tesla Model S or a Lucid Air,” Bernard says.', 'Design-wise, the 0 Series prototypes are bolder and more futuristic than the somewhat conventional-looking Afeela 1.', 'Still, there are neat design elements on the Afeela 1. On the front horizontal lighting system, you can change the text and create greetings such as “Welcome Bob” on the bumper.', 'In the cabin, the vehicles appear equally tech-savvy with massive screens across the dashboard including two peripheral screens that display the side-camera views.', 'The 0 Series also gets an all-new in-house vehicle operating system, dubbed Asimo OS, which pays tribute to the Honda Asimo robot revealed at CES in 2000.', 'The Afeela 1 doesn’t have that. But it will have a 90-kilowatt-hour battery, 40 sensors and 70-per-cent recyclable seats. And that hefty price tag – US$89,900 for the base Origin model and US$102,900 for the top Signature trim.', 'No word yet on pricing for the 0 Series. Honda confirmed production versions of the 0 Saloon and 0 SUV concepts will go on sale in North America in 2026. The 0 SUV will arrive first, starting in the first half of 2026; the Saloon will follow in late 2026. Both will be built at Honda’s new EV hub in Ohio.', 'But that’s not all. In late January, a report by Nikkei outlined Honda’s plans to build its smallest and cheapest EV model under the 0 Series, starting at less than US$30,000. It could arrive in the U.S. as early as next year. And it may be built in Ohio alongside the 0 Series prototypes.', 'Even though the 0 Series Saloon and SUV prototypes are meant to be global vehicles, Honda is working on another EV platform in China that’s roughly the same size as the 0 Series, Bernard says.', '“If you want to add a different complexity, the 0 series is intended to be global, yet Honda on their own is doing another platform in China so their EV strategy seems to be a little scattershot. And I’m not sure why,” he says.', 'Further complicating matters is Honda’s potential merger with Nissan, which Bernard says is another odd partnership that appears short on benefits for Honda.', '“If I were a Honda shareholder, I would not be comfortable if my company were merging with another company that was in serious financial trouble,” he says. “Acquiring another company that has some good assets at a good price is a different story. But with the merger, there’s not a lot of obvious reasons why Honda is getting into it.”', 'Nissan cut its annual profit forecast by 70 per cent and a senior official told the Financial Times late last year, “We have 12 to 14 months to survive.”', 'Bernard says the only benefit he could see is from Nissan’s truck capability if Honda wants to get into body-on-frame vehicles.', 'Honda hasn’t backed off its ambitious EV goals. The Japanese automaker is targeting two million EVs and 1.3 million hybrid vehicles by 2030. That’s a big jump from what it’s currently selling. In 2024, Honda sold 3.6 million cars globally, of which 66,000 were EVs, according to J.D. Power. It’s also heavily invested in batteries, running a demonstration production line for solid-state batteries at its research and development centre in Japan.', '“Solid state batteries [are] the next big step in battery technology in terms of longer range, safer, faster charging, higher power density – all the things you want to hear about next-generation technology,” Bernard says. “No one is quiet there, yet. But Honda may be positioning themselves to be upfront.”', 'Bernard thinks Honda’s loyal customers will give it an edge over other EV competitors. He points to the fact that the Honda Prologue outsold the Chevrolet Blazer in the U.S. last year: Honda sold 33,017 Prologues while Chevrolet sold 23,115 Blazer EVs.', '“I think Honda is a bit more bulletproof … The perception that Hondas are built to last, especially as people are concerned about the longevity of EVs, might be something that plays into Honda’s future success,” Bernard says.', '“Every automaker makes some questionable product decisions and Honda is no exception, but they have the global footprint in terms of sales and manufacturing, [and] a reasonably diverse portfolio,” he says. “I think Honda is pretty well positioned for the future. The technology behind the 0 Series EVs seem state-of-the-art. If the technologies actually make it to production, they will have some very competitive products. Granted, we haven’t seen a final production version, yet.”', 'Shopping for a new car?

In 2022, Honda said the original investment was around $700 million.', '""We took a look at how we could get to that end goal of recreating that ideal line and being able to bring new technologies and new EV products into our customers\' hands without impacting our production,” said Tim Leopold, associate chief engineer at the Marysville Auto Plant. “We had to take a look at how we could connect the dots without disrupting our operations, to maintain that daily production value and those high safety and quality standards.""', 'The retooling process has been complex, with construction and new line integration at the same time with ongoing vehicle production.', '""We were able to actually take parts of our facility and repurpose them instead of building new,” said Leopold. “That helped not only in the lead time to be able to bring products like this to the market faster but also helped in our ability to pivot into that new environment for both ICE, hybrid, and EV production on a common line.""', 'The 3-in-1 line provides flexibility based on consumer patterns and external market pressures.', '""I think for us that flexibility is just paramount, and I think we made a crazy good decision three years ago to create this,” said Mike Fischer, executive chief engineer at Honda Development and Manufacturing of America. “It was for that very purpose that there are so many things outside our circle of influence that have potential for us to drift from that.""', 'Fischer told Consumer 10’s Clay Gordon that even when faced with EV tax credit cuts and potential tariffs, this new line will help insolate Honda from manufacturing disruptions.', ""“If you think about that flexibility in many of the other OEMs they're setting up exclusive EV facilities that based on that exclusive product demand, depending on what the customers are, it could idle a facility, put it at 50% and in our case, basically we're creating our manufacturing business model based on what the customer's requirements are,” said Fischer. “Internal combustion, EV, or hybrid, we're keeping our facilities running full, [which] equals stability for our associates, equals stability for the company, equals good cost positioning overall that we can pass on to customers.”"", 'The all-new Acura RSX will be the first produced at the Ohio EV Hub, expected to roll off the line in late 2025.

One will result in a small battery pack for one of Honda‘s hybrids; the other will produce a large pack for a dedicated battery-electric vehicle. They’ll be stacked alongside the inline-four and V6 gas engines queuing up to leave Honda’s Anna Engine Plant for their final assembly locations.', 'Honda has been building cars in Ohio for more than 40 years, but not like this.', 'This “megacasting” process is just one of many new strategies being implemented in support of Honda’s 0-Series electrification effort. It may not sound as sexy as “gigacasting,” but it’s a critical component of the company’s new flexible strategy. Honda will eventually have six megacasting presses in operation, and while they may be cranking out battery cases now, they could be reconfigured to produce virtually anything up to the physical limitations of the press—provided it’s something you can make out of aluminum. Internal combustion engine blocks? Sure. Heads for those same power plants? No problem. And as tantalizing as the promises of gigacasting may be, some automakers have already run afoul of its limitations.', 'Even with fully formed parts essentially squirting out of a giant robot, we’re still far from an assembled car. For that, we head over to Honda’s Marysville Auto Plant. MAP was the first truly successful foreign car factory in the United States, and while it looks nothing like it did back in 1982, it remains a vanguard for Honda’s innovation. Over the past year, the automaker has been re-imagining and reshaping its entire MAP production operation, merging assembly lines together and forging a new modular system that gives Honda virtually unlimited freedom to react to market demand.', 'The battery cases arrive at MAP still empty. Here, newly retrained associates assemble and test the packs. There’s no assembly line in the traditional sense; instead of a conveyor belt, the cases move from station to station on top of small automated guided vehicles (AGVs). These follow a set path laid out on the floor, silently and safely guiding the heavy packs from person to person. Completed packs can be stockpiled here or sent directly to the line, where they’ll fall in beside the gasoline engines, which also require some final dressing after being trucked over from Anna. Whether it’s a BEV, HEV, or simple ICE vehicle, determining what gets built is really no more complicated than pointing and clicking. No matter if it’s a batch of a hundred or a dozen, or even a single unit, the line can accommodate so long as Honda can feed it the parts.', 'The rapid prototyping and assembly of this new line puts Honda’s choice to leapfrog its partnership with General Motors in a new light. With its new architecture in the works and in-house models due to roll off the assembly line later this year, the company is in a strong position to either benefit from the current electrification climate or weather what’s to come. Still, Honda recognizes that EVs are in their relative infancy, and the company remains committed to developing solid-state batteries for mass-market autos. Look for more news on that front soon—like, really soon.', 'Got a tip? Send it in: tips@thedrive.com', 'Byron is one of those weird car people who has never owned an automatic transmission. Born in the DMV but Midwestern at heart, he lives outside of Detroit with his wife, two cats, a Miata, a Wrangler, and a Blackwing.', 'Get the latest car news, reviews, and features.', 'By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.', '© 2025 Recurrent Ventures.
