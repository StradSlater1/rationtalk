Its focus on efficiency jump-starts the race for small AI models based on lean data, consuming slender computing resources.

Essentially, because they’re among the richest companies in the world, they believed they could throw more resources at the problem than anyone else and come out on top.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDeepSeek chaos suggests ‘America First’ may not always win', 'Now, all of that has been called into question. And tech giants are facing tough questions from Wall Street.', 'The name of the AI game may no longer be winning with the most expensive, ever-more powerful models.', '“The paradigm is shifting,” said Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.', '“It’s so hard to own a scientific breakthrough” such as an AI model advancement, Kass said, and prevent competitors from catching up. Instead, tech companies may now find themselves competing to lower costs and build more helpful applications for consumers and corporate customers — and also to suck up less power and natural resources in the process.', 'At least one American tech leader has already promised to respond to DeepSeek by speeding up the release of more powerful models.', 'OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 model “impressive” in an X post Monday, adding that “we will pull up some releases” of new models in response. OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also said the company’s upcoming o3 model, set to launch in the coming weeks, would “be another major step up.”', '“It’s a super competitive industry, right? And this is showing that it’s competitive globally, not just within the US,” Weil said on a call with reporters about OpenAI’s new ChatGPT offering for government agencies, in response to a question from CNN. “We’re committed to moving really quickly here. We want to stay ahead.”', 'But analysts also expect the Big Tech companies to scale back their data center spending plans and potentially rethink how much they’re charging consumers. DeepSeek has proved it’s possible to provide the technology at a lesser cost, although some industry experts have raised eyebrows at the startup’s claims about spending just under $6 million to build its model.', 'OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, is investigating whether DeepSeek trained its model off of stolen OpenAI data, Bloomberg reported. Even if the company achieved its efficiency revolution with some malfeasance, DeepSeek’s achievements have lit a fire under Silicon Valley’s AI industry.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nDeepSeek just blew up the AI industry’s narrative that it needs more money and power', '“All those other frontier model labs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — are going to build far more efficient models based on what they’re learning from DeepSeek,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment firm D.A. Davidson. “And you’ll be able to use those at a fraction of the price that you can now, because it’s going to be a fraction of the cost to run those models.”', 'To be sure, the industry was almost certainly going to eventually shift its focus to “efficiency” — working to add AI capabilities using a set amount of computing power versus adding more servers to juice the technology. There are only so many computers you can build and only so much electricity available to service them. And an AI tool can only get so proficient at, say, writing emails or planning trips, before making it marginally more powerful is no longer worthwhile.', 'But DeepSeek appears to have sped up that timeline. And in Silicon Valley, unwinding spending on data centers could be tricky.', 'Just last week, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank visited the White House to announce the creation of a new company and a $500 million investment in US AI infrastructure; Microsoft CEO Sundar Pichai affirmed he was “good for” his company’s planned $80 billion investment in AI development and infrastructure this year; and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s AI spending could reach as much as $65 billion this year.', '“That crazy AI data center build-out that we’ve been talking about for the last couple of years? They don’t need to do that anymore. They can build a lot less because they can provide a lot more services at a much lower price,” Luria said. He added that investors will likely expect to hear about those plans in the American tech companies’ earnings calls over the next two weeks.', 'Of course, if the tech giants cut data center costs for training AI models — and therefore charge customers less — their tools will get used more, putting more inference (or people asking questions) strain on the data centers, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Tuesday. So just how dramatic that pullback on data center spending might be remains to be seen.', 'Some tech leaders say they’re looking at DeepSeek as validation — rather than a threat.', 'Proponents of open-source AI — where the model’s underlying architecture is made publicly available, rather than charged for — say the Chinese model is proof that American companies should be sharing their innovations rather than gatekeeping them. That way, the whole US field could advance more quickly and remain the technology standard around the world.', '“The United States already has the best closed models in the world. To remain competitive, we must also support the development of a vibrant open-source ecosystem,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday.', 'Meta, which has pushed open-source AI with its Llama model, also said such models are “driving a significant shift in the industry, and that’s going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster.”', 'And even if DeepSeek forces a short-term rethinking of the business model Silicon Valley had envisioned for AI, people who believe the technology will change the world should be glad for the advancement, Kass said.', '“We are freaked out fairly, I suppose, because we thought we had global AI supremacy, when, in fact, we should be celebrating,” Kass said. “Because this is one more piece of evidence that the AI revolution is going to democratize technology and it’s going to be fairly distributed.”', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

DeepSeek’s Latest Breakthrough Is Redefining AI Race,https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseeks-latest-breakthrough-redefining-ai-race,"['Photo: Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images', 'Commentary by Yasir Atalan', 'Published February 3, 2025', 'On January 20, contrary to what export controls promised, Chinese researchers at DeepSeek released a high-performance large language model (LLM)—R1—at a small fraction of OpenAI’s costs, showing how rapidly Beijing can innovate around U.S. hardware restrictions. This launch was not an isolated event. Ahead of the Lunar New Year, three other Chinese labs announced AI models they claimed could match—even surpass—OpenAI’s o1 performance on key benchmarks. These simultaneous releases, likely to be orchestrated by the Chinese government, signaled a potential shift in the global AI landscape, raising questions about the U.S. competitive edge in the AI race. If Washington doesn’t adapt to this new reality, the next Chinese breakthrough could indeed become the Sputnik moment some fear.', 'News of this breakthrough rattled markets, causing NVIDIA’s stock to dip 17 percent on January 27 amid fears that demand for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs)—until now considered essential for training advanced AI—could falter. The performance of these models and coordination of these releases led observers to liken the situation to a “Sputnik moment,” drawing comparisons to the 1957 Soviet satellite launch that shocked the United States due to fears of falling behind.', 'Until recently, conventional wisdom held that Washington enjoyed a decisive advantage in cutting-edge LLMs in part because U.S. firms could afford massive compute budgets, powered by NVIDIA’s high-performance GPUs. To maintain its edge in the race, the Biden administration implemented export controls to prevent China from acquiring these advanced GPU processors. The release of DeepSeek’s R1, however, calls that assumption into question: Despite limited access to top-tier U.S. chips, Chinese labs appear to be finding new efficiencies that let them produce powerful AI models at lower cost.', 'Still, upon closer inspection, this falls short of a true Sputnik moment. For one thing, DeepSeek and other Chinese AI models still depend on U.S.-made hardware. Moreover, the AI race is ongoing, and iterative, not a one-shot demonstration of technological supremacy like launching the first satellite. However, the fact that it is not a Sputnik moment should not lull the United States. If the United States does not double down on AI infrastructure, incentivize an open-source environment, and overhaul its export control measures to China, the next Chinese breakthrough may actually become a Sputnik-level event.', 'From last month to this month, the real change is the efficiency. DeepSeek researchers found a way to get more computational power from NVIDIA chips, allowing foundational models to be trained with significantly less computational power. Smaller companies and startups will now be able to replicate low-cost algorithms and potentially innovate upon them, enabling the development of more affordable and accessible low-tier and specialized AI applications across various domains.', 'Of note, China’s sudden leap in AI efficiency highlights the growing impact of open-source collaboration. DeepSeek released R1 under an MIT license, making the model’s “weights” (underlying parameters) publicly available. This move mirrors other open models—Llama, Qwen, Mistral—and contrasts with closed systems like GPT or Claude. In practice, open-source AI frameworks often foster rapid innovation because developers worldwide can inspect, modify, and improve the underlying technology.', 'From a U.S. perspective, open-source breakthroughs can lower barriers for new entrants, encouraging small startups and research groups that lack massive budgets for proprietary data centers or GPU clusters can build their own models more effectively. Instead of reinventing the wheel from scratch, they can build on proven models at minimal cost, focusing their energy on specialized improvements. That means the next wave of AI applications—particularly smaller, more specialized models—will become more affordable, spurring broader market competition. U.S. companies that embrace these open approaches stand to create robust, adaptable solutions applicable in defense and commercial sectors. Indeed, open-source software—already present in over 96 percent of civil and military codebases—will remain the backbone of next-generation infrastructure for years to come.', 'If anything, DeepSeek’s accomplishment signals that the demand for powerful GPUs is likely to keep growing in the long term, not shrink. More efficient training techniques could mean more projects entering the market simultaneously, whether from China or the United States. This phenomenon mirrors Jevons’ Paradox: When a resource becomes more efficient, its overall consumption tends to soar. Given the continued importance of U.S.-made hardware within the AI landscape, it’s clear that the demand for powerful GPUs will continue.', 'Sputnik was a technological feat largely independent of U.S. expertise or resources. During the Cold War, rival powers raced to amass proprietary technologies in near-total secrecy, with victory defined by who could hoard the most advanced hardware and software. The immediate parallel to Sputnik, therefore, overlooks how much of this technology still draws from U.S. research and supply chains. In the AI race, unlike the Cold War, China and the United States draw on each other’s research, open-source tools, and specialized hardware.', 'China allowing open sourcing of its most advanced model without fear of losing its advantage signals that Beijing understands the logic of AI competition. Each improvement by one player feeds into the next round of global development—even competitors can iterate on publicly shared advances. This leads to faster technology lifecycles and wider adoption, favoring those with vibrant entrepreneurial communities, high-end research labs, and strong venture capital networks. This dynamic, in turn, strengthens the United States’ technology ecosystem by fostering a diverse pipeline of niche AI products, many of which can compete globally.', 'First, the Trump administration should adopt a long-term perspective rather than defaulting to retaliatory measures. DeepSeek’s efficiency gains may have startled markets, but if Washington doubles down on AI incentives, it can solidify the United States’ advantage. This means investing not only in ambitious programs targeting advanced AI (such as AGI) but also in “low-tier” applications—where high-volume, user-focused tools stand to make an immediate impact on both consumers and businesses.', 'Open-source AI development is key to this strategy. Open-source projects allow smaller startups and research teams to participate in cutting-edge work without massive budgets. To bolster this trend, the White House could offer tax credits or accelerated depreciation for private-sector investments in open-source AI. Such policies would also encourage deeper collaboration with allies and partners, harnessing the United States’ vibrant entrepreneurial culture and extensive research network.', 'Second, the export-control measures must be rethought in light of this new competitive landscape. DeepSeek’s breakthrough underscores that the AI race is continuous, the gap between the United States and China is narrower than previously assumed, and that innovation by industry startups is the backbone of this race. U.S. strategy of containment with export controls will surely limit the scalability of the AI industry within China. Even though DeepSeek’s R1 reduces training costs, text and image generation (inference) still use significant computational power. This will likely be a bottleneck, preventing China from scaling its AI service offerings to the globe, under tightening chip sanctions. However, the DeepSeek example showed that export controls cannot kill innovation. Those who are not able to access these chips will innovate their own ways. These blanket restrictions should give way to more detailed and targeted export-control systems. Recent AI diffusion rule puts 150 countries in the middle tier category in which exports of advanced chips to these countries will face difficulties. Those countries will either innovate their own industries or will develop ties with China. This is why such a blanket approach will need to be reconsidered. Moreover, U.S. export control policies must be paired with better enforcement to curb the black market for banned AI chips.', 'Finally, the Trump administration should invest in robust evaluation programs to identify and mitigate bias in emerging AI models. As smaller, specialized applications gain traction, transparent testing frameworks become vital for building public trust and ensuring market scalability. A system that flags and corrects issues—like DeepSeek’s purported bias on China-related topics—can ensure these models remain globally relevant, fueling further innovation and investment in U.S.-led AI research.', 'Ultimately, DeepSeek is not a Sputnik moment, yet. If the United States adopts a long-term view and strengthens its own AI eco-system encouraging open collaboration, investing in critical infrastructure, it can prevent a Sputnik moment in this competition. DeepSeek is indeed a boon for the AI industry.

In December the company claimed its V3 model cost just $6 million to train, staggeringly low compared to the more than $100 million OpenAI spent on GPT-4.', 'Training costs might be lower than those in the U.S., but the real costs start to stack up when models are running at scale.', '“While the training might be cheaper, it doesn’t really change the game,” said Jason Snyder, chief technology officer at Momentum Worldwide, explaining that the biggest cost in AI is not training the model, but the ongoing costs of running it at scale—also known as inference. Companies like OpenAI and Meta spend billions running their models, a cost that DeepSeek will eventually face as well.', 'Without China’s access to high-end Nvidia GPUs, DeepSeek relies on local alternatives like those from Huawei, which help lower training costs, Snyder pointed out.', 'Despite the excitement, DeepSeek has not made a huge breakthrough in innovation.', 'The model has been optimized for good enough performance, according to Snyder, not cutting-edge results. ', 'While R1’s performance is impressive, it falls short of matching the capabilities of GPT-4. According to Snyder, DeepSeek’s model is more in line with GPT-3.5, not the advanced GPT-4 turbo or Gemini 1.5 models.', '“Because it’s open-source people assume it’s a free version of GPT-4,” Snyder said. “It’s good, but it’s not a game changer.”', 'Not just for the above reasons, but while R1 may perform well on certain benchmarks, it doesn’t signal a loss of AI supremacy for the U.S.', 'According to Snyder, the U.S. leads in cutting-edge research, model deployment, and enterprise adoption. China, despite making strides, is still behind when it comes to frontier AI (the most advanced AI models) and AGI (artificial general intelligence).', '“China is betting on open-source adoption to close the gap, but it hasn’t taken the lead,” Snyder said.', 'Zack Kass, AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead, explains that owning frontier technology is only part of the equation. “It’s the adoption of the technology that ultimately defines economic success,” he said, pointing to OpenAI’s rapid deployment of ChatGPT as a prime example.', 'The Biggest Agentic AI Trends at CES 2025', '', 'Many are touting DeepSeek’s open-source model as a democratizing force in AI, claiming it levels the playing field.

DeepSeek Just Changed Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Forever. 2 Surprising Winners From Its Innovation.,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/deepseek-just-changed-generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-forever-2-surprising-winners,"['February 02, 2025 — 12:15 pm EST', 'Written by Adam Levy for The Motley Fool ->', 'On Jan. 20, Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek released its first-generation reasoning models. In the release, the company made some astonishing claims.', ""First, DeepSeek said its DeepSeek-R1 model achieves performance comparable with OpenAI-o1, widely considered the best-performing model available across most domains. Considering the Chinese company is working with significantly worse hardware than OpenAI and other American companies, that's certainly remarkable."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks »', ""Even more impressive is that the company claims to have achieved these results at an incredibly low cost. R1 was built on DeepSeek's V3 large language model, released in December. The company estimates the compute cost for training V3 came to just $5.6 million. To put that in perspective, OpenAI's GPT-4 cost $100 million to train."", ""DeepSeek achieved similar performance at a fraction of the cost. And since it's completely open source, allowing anyone to copy its techniques, it will have lasting implications on the entire industry."", ""Two companies, in particular, are in a great position to benefit from DeepSeek's innovations."", 'Image source: Getty Images.', ""DeepSeek focused on maximizing the efficiency of its limited hardware capabilities. Because of AI chip export restrictions, Nvidia isn't able to sell its most powerful H100 GPUs in China. Instead, it sells H800 GPUs, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. regulations. The H800 reduces the chip-to-chip transfer rate, reducing the speed at which it's possible to train large AI models."", 'Due to such limitations, DeepSeek developed processes that enable it to reduce the amount of data it needs to transfer throughout the system at any given time. For example, its ""mixture of experts,"" or DeepSeekMoE, introduced last year, made it so it only had to activate part of the model to respond to queries.', ""DeepSeek isn't the only company using this method, but its novel approach also made its training more efficient. Most methods involve more training overhead in order to reduce the cost of inference later on."", 'The start-up also developed methods to reduce the amount of memory required for AI inference by compressing important data before storing and transmitting it. It brought new approaches to load balancing, which is how processes are distributed across its network of GPUs.', ""The result of these and other breakthroughs isn't just an AI model that's faster to train and costs less. The longer-term impact of DeepSeek's innovations are that it's cheaper to run, and it can run on less-capable hardware. In other words, AI inference just got a lot more accessible."", ""In a world with the potential to run AI systems on hardware that fits in your pocket and for a tiny fraction of a penny, there are two very big winners: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Here's why."", 'When Apple started developing its artificial intelligence features for the iPhone and other devices, it put data privacy at the forefront of its efforts. Apple Intelligence is designed to run as much as possible on the iPhone. When it has to make a call to the cloud, it takes every step it can to encrypt user data in the process.', ""There's a reason the new AI features Apple introduced last year are only available on iPhones released in the last 15 months. Since Apple is trying to keep everything on the device, it needs enough processing power and memory to run its AI. The newest iPhone chip, the A18 Pro, boosted the memory bandwidth to support faster AI processing."", ""Apple could adopt many of DeepSeek's methods to make the iPhone more capable of handling AI inference. That opens the door for features like a more conversational and context-aware Siri, faster translation with no internet connection needed, smart camera features, and better productivity tools. More advanced AI features could boost Apple's iPhone sales and services revenue."", 'Apple stock currently trades for a relatively high multiple of 32.5 times forward earnings. But with its massive cash flow, which it uses to buy back shares, and improving profitability from services revenue, it can justify that high multiple, especially considering the consistency Apple has exhibited in recent years. The potential boost from major improvements to on-device AI could be a catalyst for growth over the next few years.', ""Meta's AI spending is growing fast as it works to scale its capabilities and expand AI features to more parts of its business. Capital expenditures grew about 40% in 2024, and management said it expects a 60% increase in 2025. Those AI investments have paid off well for Meta, resulting in stronger engagement, better advertising tools, and new features like Meta AI, which have the potential to become meaningful sources of revenue down the road."", 'One important decision Meta made when it came to AI was to open-source its AI model Llama. One of the impetuses behind that decision was to help make the model more efficient. In fact, DeepSeek used Llama as the foundation for developing R1, so this is exactly what Meta hoped for.', 'Reducing the cost of AI inference could unlock huge profits for Meta. It\'s a problem Meta\'s been working on for a long time. ""A lot of the stuff is expensive, right, to kind of generate an image or a video or a chat interaction,"" Zuckerberg said during anearnings callin Feb. 2023. ""So one of the big interesting challenges here also is going to be how do we scale this and make this work more efficient so that way, we can bring it to a much larger user base.""', ""DeepSeek's answering that challenge and giving Meta the tools it needs to scale AI to its 3 billion users. While Meta might not slow down its spending on AI anytime soon, it's now capable of making a lot more money off the spending it's committed to."", ""Meta stock has zoomed higher on the DeepSeek news, reaching a new all-time high. Still, shares trade for 26.8 times forward earnings estimates as of this writing. Meta's also a cash cow, using excess free cash flow to buy back shares and support strong earnings-per-share growth. If it can make AI more profitable, it stands to see earnings climb substantially over the next few years, making it well worth the price."", 'Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

With that in mind, should investors buy the dip on Nvidia?"", 'Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.

The U.S. has banned companies like Nvidia from selling some of their most advanced chips to China due to concerns about how that country might use their capabilities.', 'Part of the investment thesis for Nvidia lately has been that it has an enormous competitive moat, thanks to its cutting-edge GPUs and its CUDA platform.', 'Its high gross profit margins -- in the 74% to 79% range last year -- support this premise, showing that it has near-complete control of the AI chip market and its own pricing power. But all this could be threatened if a company with fewer than 200 employees spent less than $10 million and used old Nvidia chips to replicate the current state of the art in AI software.', 'Many doubt that the cost of DeepSeek\'s chatbot was only $5.6 million, and have questioned what inputs actually went into its design. That\'s why it was interesting to see Nvidia\'s commentary about DeepSeek. An Nvidia spokesperson praised it as ""an excellent AI advancement"" that illustrates how new models can be created ""leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.""', ""The company also said that DeepSeek shows that Nvidia's chips are useful in China, a material revenue driver for the company, and that this market will need more of its chips to meet demand."", 'Analysts largely refuted the idea that DeepSeek\'s rise could mean the end of Nvidia. Most actually see it as an opportunity for the broader AI trend. Daniel Newman, chief strategist at global tech researcher The Futurum Group, called the sell-off an overreaction: ""If we can use compute more efficiently ... the companies that we\'re saying aren\'t driving enough revenue will be able to build their models cheaper. They\'ll be able to create solutions with less overhead expense, and they\'re going to drive more [earnings per share].""', 'Although companies like Meta Platforms have pledged to spend tens of billions on AI infrastructure, they could also likely benefit if it turns out that some of this spending is not necessary, although that would open the door for competitors as well.', 'Do I think Nvidia is done for? Absolutely not. Companies like Nvidia with tons of resources tend to find ways to not only survive but also get ahead of competitors.', ""If DeepSeek does make AI software more widespread, that could drive more uses and boost demand for Nvidia's chips. Following the big sell-off on Jan. 27 and a mild rebound on Jan. 28, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) stood slightly above its five-year average."", '', 'NVDA PE ratio (forward); data by YCharts.', 'My issue with Nvidia and its ""Magnificent Seven"" cohort is that they are still trading at high multiples in a bull market that has lasted for more than two years.

Three things to know as the dust settles from DeepSeek,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/04/1110918/three-things-to-know-as-the-dust-settles-from-deepseek/,"['As the initial hype fades, here are the likely longer-term impacts.', 'This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.', 'The launch of a single new AI model does not normally cause much of a stir outside tech circles, nor does it typically spook investors enough to wipe out $1 trillion in the stock market. Now, a couple of weeks since DeepSeek’s big moment, the dust has settled a bit. The news cycle has moved on to calmer things, like the dismantling of long-standing US federal programs, the purging of research and data sets to comply with recent executive orders, and the possible fallouts from President Trump’s new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.', 'Within AI, though, what impact is DeepSeek likely to have in the longer term? Here are three seeds DeepSeek has planted that will grow even as the initial hype fades.', 'First, it’s forcing a debate about how much energy AI models should be allowed to use up in pursuit of better answers. ', 'You may have heard (including from me) that DeepSeek is energy efficient. That’s true for its training phase, but for inference, which is when you actually ask the model something and it produces an answer, it’s complicated. It uses a chain-of-thought technique, which breaks down complex questions–-like whether it’s ever okay to lie to protect someone’s feelings—into chunks, and then logically answers each one. The method allows models like DeepSeek to do better at math, logic, coding, and more. ', 'The problem, at least to some, is that this way of “thinking” uses up a lot more electricity than the AI we’ve been used to. Though AI is responsible for a small slice of total global emissions right now, there is increasing political support to radically increase the amount of energy going toward AI. Whether or not the energy intensity of chain-of-thought models is worth it, of course, depends on what we’re using the AI for. Scientific research to cure the world’s worst diseases seems worthy. Generating AI slop? Less so. ', 'Some experts worry that the impressiveness of DeepSeek will lead companies to incorporate it into lots of apps and devices, and that users will ping it for scenarios that don’t call for it. (Asking DeepSeek to explain Einstein’s theory of relativity is a waste, for example, since it doesn’t require logical reasoning steps, and any typical AI chat model can do it with less time and energy.) Read more from me here. ', 'Second, DeepSeek made some creative advancements in how it trains, and other companies are likely to follow its lead. ', 'Advanced AI models don’t just learn on lots of text, images, and video. They rely heavily on humans to clean that data, annotate it, and help the AI pick better responses, often for paltry wages. ', 'One way human workers are involved is through a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback. The model generates an answer, human evaluators score that answer, and those scores are used to improve the model. OpenAI pioneered this technique, though it’s now used widely by the industry. ', 'As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven reports, DeepSeek did something different: It figured out a way to automate this process of scoring and reinforcement learning. “Skipping or cutting down on human feedback—that’s a big thing,” Itamar Friedman, a former research director at Alibaba and now cofounder and CEO of Qodo, an AI coding startup based in Israel, told him. “You’re almost completely training models without humans needing to do the labor.” ', 'It works particularly well for subjects like math and coding, but not so well for others, so workers are still relied upon. Still, DeepSeek then went one step further and used techniques reminiscent of how Google DeepMind trained its AI model back in 2016 to excel at the game Go, essentially having it map out possible moves and evaluate their outcomes. These steps forward, especially since they are outlined broadly in DeepSeek’s open-source documentation, are sure to be followed by other companies. Read more from Will Douglas Heaven here. ', 'Everyone thinks they know, but no one can agree. And that’s a problem.', 'Third, its success will fuel a key debate: Can you push for AI research to be open for all to see and push for US competitiveness against China at the same time?', 'Long before DeepSeek released its model for free, certain AI companies were arguing that the industry needs to be an open book. If researchers subscribed to certain open-source principles and showed their work, they argued, the global race to develop superintelligent AI could be treated like a scientific effort for public good, and the power of any one actor would be checked by other participants.', 'It’s a nice idea. Meta has largely spoken in support of that vision, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has said that open-source approaches can be more effective at keeping AI safe than government regulation. OpenAI has been on the opposite side of that argument, keeping its models closed off on the grounds that it can help keep them out of the hands of bad actors. ', 'DeepSeek has made those narratives a bit messier. “We have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open-source strategy,” OpenAI’s Sam Altman said in a Reddit AMA on Friday, which is surprising given OpenAI’s past stance. Others, including President Trump, doubled down on the need to make the US more competitive on AI, seeing DeepSeek’s success as a wake-up call. Dario Amodei, a founder of Anthropic, said it’s a reminder that the US needs to tightly control which types of advanced chips make their way to China in the coming years, and some lawmakers are pushing the same point. ', 'The coming months, and future launches from DeepSeek and others, will stress-test every single one of these arguments. ', 'OpenAI launches a research tool', 'On Sunday, OpenAI launched a tool called Deep Research. You can give it a complex question to look into, and it will spend up to 30 minutes reading sources, compiling information, and writing a report for you. It’s brand new, and we haven’t tested the quality of its outputs yet. Since its computations take so much time (and therefore energy), right now it’s only available to users with OpenAI’s paid Pro tier ($200 per month) and limits the number of queries they can make per month. ', 'Why it matters: AI companies have been competing to build useful “agents” that can do things on your behalf. On January 23, OpenAI launched an agent called Operator that could use your computer for you to do things like book restaurants or check out flight options. The new research tool signals that OpenAI is not just trying to make these mundane online tasks slightly easier; it wants to position AI as able to handle  professional research tasks. It claims that Deep Research “accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.” Time will tell if users will find it worth the high costs and the risk of including wrong information.

But in an era of U.S.-China technology rivalry and mistrust, and entities from NASA to the U.S. Navy and Taiwanese government prohibiting use of DeepSeek within days, is it wise of millions of Americans to let the app start playing around with their personal search inquiries?', 'The sudden rise of DeepSeek — created on a rapid timeline and on a budget reportedly much lower than previously thought possible — caught AI experts off guard, though skepticism over the claims remain and some estimates suggest the Chinese company understated costs by hundreds of millions of dollars. Privacy advocates were caught off guard, too, and their concerns aren’t predicated on AI development costs, and they already warning that Americans are putting themselves and their privacy at risk.', 'The amount of data and information that bad actors in China could harvest from DeepSeek is 20 times worse than what could be collected from a Google search, says Dewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at risk management firm Longview Global, which advises companies on China strategy.', '“It is a rich trove of intelligence,” said McNeal, who has studied the details of Chinese government data sharing requirements for domestic firms.', 'There are obvious risks, he said, such as personal banking or health information that can be stolen, and prominent cybersecurity firms are already reporting vulnerabilities in DeepSeek. DeepSeek itself reported being hit with a major cyberattack last week.', 'But McNeal is just as worried about the “bigger picture” competition between nations.', '“I want us to speak broader than just the narrow data; we often don’t speak about the degree to which this information paints a mental map through understanding queries,” McNeal said.', 'For example, Chinese intelligence could use the broader patterns of queries in DeepSeek to learn about various American industries and to sow division among the public.', '“The world won’t end tomorrow because I logged into DeepSeek,” McNeal said, but he added that does not mean there isn’t considerable risk involved. The AI’s open-source approach, for one, could give China access to US-based supply chains at an industry level, allowing them to learn what companies are doing and better compete against them. “National security professionals are thinking about it in those terms,” McNeal said.', 'Matt Pearl, a special advisor to the deputy national security advisor at the National Security Council in the Biden administration and now the Strategic Technologies Program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said DeepSeek’s privacy policy implies that people have control over what is collected, but it should induce alarm.', '“DeepSeek’s privacy policy is not worth the paper it is written on,” Pearl said. DeepSeek is subjected to PRC laws and anything entered into the app is fair game. Through keystroke patterns, a DeepSeek user can be tracked across all devices, information gathered from advertisers, and DeepSeek could also seek to leverage cameras and microphones, according to Pearl.', '“If they can do it technically in the app and the PRC determines it is something they want to do, then it poses a danger,” Pearl said.', 'But the threat that Pearl said most keeps him up at night is related to cybersecurity and the potential for a mass malware injection. “It is hard to emphasize all the different potential ways in which it could be used. And, in theory, it could be done in a single update to the app,” he said.', 'Officials at High Flyer, the Chinese-backed hedge fund which created DeepSeek, did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Despite the outsized impact on the markets and leading AI firms including Nvidia, DeepSeek still has a long way to go to catch up to rival ChatGPT, which is continuing to raise a formidable war chest — a few days after the DeepSeek headlines dominated the tech and markets news cycle, OpenAI was reportedly in talks for a $40 billion funding round.', 'DeepSeek remains far behind ChatGPT in consumer activity, according to online analytics platform Semrush, with the OpenAI app maintaining an average daily visit count in the tens of millions. But ChatGPT has experienced a recent dip in traffic — it had 22.1 million visitors on October 1, 2024, but that had declined to 14.9 million by January 19, according to Semrush. At the same time, even before it became a major national news story, DeepSeek’s online footprint was growing — from 2.3K average U.S. daily visits on October 1, 2024, to 71.2K by January 19 (a week before it caused the stock market to tank).', 'Joe Jones, director of research and insights for The International Association of Privacy Professionals, a policy-neutral nonprofit that promotes privacy and AI governance, says that disruptors like DeepSeek can make the organization’s job more difficult.', '“It is challenging for people to do that work when you have proliferating laws that are complex, diverse, and often in tension, and technologies like DeepSeek that come at you from left field, upend status quos and make you rethink good governance,” Jones said. The fact that the debate is playing out across borders makes it more contentious. “This has gotten a whole lot more complex in this turbocharged geopolitical environment,” Jones added.', 'The challenges will not be solved any time soon, according to Brendan Englot, director of the Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the Stevens Institute of Technology. “AI is now a global international competition, and we will see breakthroughs all over the world,” Englot said.', 'The open-source technology approach leveraged by DeepSeek — an approach promoted by Meta — means more DeepSeeks are coming. “There will be many more disruptions just like this one shortly,” Englot said.', 'For consumers, the tradeoffs will need to be navigated with an understanding of the data implications. The tools are being designed to improve lives by increasing efficiency and creativity. “So it is tempting to share our data, but you have to assume it is fair game to be used once you do,” Englot said.', 'DeepSeek’s success suggests that export controls on advanced chips intended to slow Chinese AI efforts might need to be even stricter, but are also no silver bullet. “To be clear, they’re not a way to duck the competition between the US and China,” wrote Dario Amodei, CEO of gen AI startup Anthropic, in a blog post this week. “In the end, AI companies in the US and other democracies must have better models than those in China if we want to prevail. But we shouldn’t hand the Chinese Communist Party technological advantages when we don’t have to.”', 'Pearl says it may ultimately fall to the U.S. government to regulate or legislate.', '“The government has the ability under the same law that they had to ban TikTok; they can ban DeepSeek. The law that was passed doesn’t just apply to TikTok,” Pearl said, citing provisions of the law related to a company controlled by a foreign adversary, or deemed by the U.S. president to be a threat to national security. Pearl thinks that despite President Trump’s backing away from a TikTok ban, US-based tech companies will likely lobby harder when it comes to AI.', '“I think you will see U.S. tech companies lobbying the admin hard on this and saying DeepSeek will corner the AI market, and it is critical to have U.S. companies at the forefront,” Pearl said. “Trump will hear from them at the highest levels. China has made champions by keeping the USA out of their markets, why should we allow them to dominate our markets?”', 'Got a confidential news tip?

Is DeepSeek China’s Sputnik Moment?,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-deepseek-chinas-sputnik-moment,"['Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek’s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek’s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as “not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China’s AI ecosystem.” As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed “outperforms” competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta “almost across the board.”', 'Alibaba’s claims haven’t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China’s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports—a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described R1 as “super impressive,” adding, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.” The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,” which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being “first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,” and he argued that DeepSeek’s progress makes “export control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.”', 'Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China’s remarkable transformation into the world’s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled “Another Sputnik Moment” to his firm’s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term “Sputnik moment” had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China’s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave’s piece said, “fighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.” In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because “it forced them to be very focused.”', 'The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump’s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way.” By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn’t violate the U.S. export bans.', '“Did DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?” Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. “I think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,” he said. “You build a ten-foot wall; I’ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China’s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.”', 'Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, “Engineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.” These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was “making it look easy” by training a “frontier-grade” large language model “on a joke of a budget.”', 'Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn’t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn’t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to “engage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.”', 'The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. “I’ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn’t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn’t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,” he said. “BYD wouldn’t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it’s a better car at a cheaper price.” Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. “It’s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,” Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. “That belief has been exploded as well,” Gave added.', 'I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. “My job isn’t to tell policymakers what to do,” he said. “My job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?” Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. “The first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,” he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country’s banks to extend credit to them. “They said, ‘No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.’ ”', 'Gave’s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China’s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. “When it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,” he said. ♦', 'Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.', 'The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.', 'Gloria Steinem’s life on the feminist frontier.', 'Where the Amish go on vacation.', 'How Colonel Sanders built his Kentucky-fried fortune.', 'What does procrastination tell us about ourselves?', 'Fiction by Patricia Highsmith: “The Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World”', 'Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.', 'Sections', 'More', '© 2025 Condé Nast.

DeepSeek has ripped away AI’s veil of mystique. That’s the real reason the tech bros fear it,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/02/deepseek-ai-veil-of-mystique-tech-bros-fear,"['While privacy fears are justified, the main beef Silicon Valley has is that China’s chatbot is democratising the technology', 'N\no, it was not a “Sputnik moment”. The launch last month of DeepSeek R1, the Chinese generative AI or chatbot, created mayhem in the tech world, with stocks plummeting and much chatter about the US losing its supremacy in AI technology. Yet, for all the disruption, the Sputnik analogy reveals less about DeepSeek than about American neuroses.', 'The original Sputnik moment came on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik 1, the first time humanity had sent a satellite into orbit. It was, to anachronistically borrow a phrase from a later and even more momentous landmark, “one giant leap for mankind”, in Neil Armstrong’s historic words as he took a “small step” on to the surface of the moon.', 'It was a significant moment in the cold war, too. A confidential White House report worried that “American prestige” had “sustained a severe blow”, giving the USSR “clear advantage in the cold war”. That fear spurred Washington into reshaping its space programme, and catalysed the Apollo missions, culminating with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming, on 20 July 1969, the first humans to walk upon another celestial body.', 'DeepSeek, sponsored by a Chinese hedge fund, is a notable achievement. Technically, though, it is no advance on large language models (LLMs) that already exist. It is neither faster nor “cleverer” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude and just as prone to “hallucinations” – the tendency, exhibited by all LLMs, to give false answers or to make up “facts” to fill gaps in its data. According to NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, DeepSeek’s chatbot made false claims 30% of the time and gave no answers to 53% of questions, compared with 40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots in NewsGuard’s most recent audit.', 'The figures expose the profound unreliability of all LLMs. DeepSeek’s particularly high non-response rate is likely to be the product of its censoriousness; it refuses to provide answers on any issue that China finds sensitive or about which it wants facts restricted, whether Tiananmen Square or Taiwan.', 'The true impact of DeepSeek is not on the technology but on the economics of AI. It is a chatbot as capable, and as flawed, as other current leading models, but built at a fraction of the cost and from inferior technology. The US ban on the sale to China of the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment, imposed by the Biden administration in 2022, and tightened several times since, was designed to curtail Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology. Paradoxically, it may have spurred Chinese researchers into becoming more innovative.', 'DeepSeek is also free to use, and open source. The combination of low cost and openness may help democratise AI technology, enabling others, especially from outside America, to enter the market. There is a certain irony that it should be China that is opening up the technology while US firms continue to create as many barriers as possible to competitors attempting to enter the field.', 'And here lies perhaps the biggest impact of DeepSeek. It has ripped off the veil of mystique that previously surrounded AI. Silicon Valley has nurtured the image of AI technology as a precious and miraculous accomplishment, and portrayed its leading figures, from Elon Musk to Sam Altman, as prophets guiding us into a new world. The technology itself has been endowed with almost magical powers, including the promise of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI – superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human abilities on any cognitive task – as being almost within our grasp.', 'Last April, Musk predicted that AI would be “smarter than any human” by the end of 2025. Last month, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the driving force behind the current generative AI boom, similarly claimed to be “confident we know how to build AGI” and that “in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’”.', 'Almost a decade ago, the Nobel prize-winning computer scientist Geoff Hinton urged nations to “stop training radiologists”, and similar medical technicians, because “it’s completely obvious within five years, deep learning [AI] is going to do better”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, a corporation founded by former OpenAI employees, has claimed that AI could double the human lifespan within five to 10 years. These fantasy claims have been shredded by critics such as the American cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who has even challenged Musk to a $1m bet over his “smarter than any human” claim for AI.', 'Nevertheless, for all the pushback, each time one fantasy prediction fails to materialise, another takes its place. Such claims derive less from technological possibilities than from political and economic needs. While AI technology has provided hugely important tools, capable of surpassing humans in specific fields, from the solving of mathematical problems to the recognition of disease patterns, the business model depends on hype. It is the hype that drives the billion-dollar investment and buys political influence, including a seat at the presidential inauguration.', 'Sign up to Observed', ""Analysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers"", '', 'It is also an approach that seeks to advance AI less through major scientific breakthroughs than through a brute force strategy of “scaling up” – building bigger models, using larger datasets, and deploying vastly greater computational power. The disruptive quality of DeepSeek lies in questioning this approach, demonstrating that the best generative AI models can be matched with much less computational power and a lower financial burden.', 'The hype around DeepSeek is in part a reflection of the hype around AI. It is a reflection, too, of geopolitical tensions. Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted but without the global tumult of the past two weeks. Beneath the panic lies fear of DeepSeek’s Chinese origins and ownership.', 'Yet, too great an obsession with the geopolitics of DeepSeek can distort the lessons we take from it. The promise of more open access to such vital technology becomes subsumed into a fear of its Chinese provenance. Concerns about privacy, censorship and surveillance, rightly raised by a model such as DeepSeek, can help obscure the reality that such issues bedevil all AI technology, not just that from China. Particularly at a time of threatened trade wars and threats to democracy, our capacity to navigate between the hype and the fear assumes new importance.', 'Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist']"

The capacity for software and systems to become more proficient at their assigned tasks over time, as well as learn new skills, gives this technology a seemingly limitless long-term ceiling.', ""However, Wall Street's DeepSeek scare from last week exposed what's arguably the biggest flaw of the AI revolution."", ""Before digging into what riled investors and how the hottest trend on Wall Street may be upended, it's important to understand how this technology has been a catalyst for America's most-influential businesses."", ""For instance, Nvidia (NVDA 1.71%) was a $360 billion company when the curtain opened in 2023. Less than two years later, its valuation would peak around $3.7 trillion. This parabolic ascent, which had never been witnessed for a market-leading business, is solely the result of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming a staple in high-compute data centers."", ""Orders for Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and successor Blackwell GPUs are backlogged, and no other AI-accelerating GPUs are particularly close to matching the computing speed of these chips. This combination of overwhelming demand and AI-GPU scarcity has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power and lifted its gross margin into the stratosphere."", ""It's somewhat of a similar story for Broadcom (AVGO 2.16%), which recently became only the 10th public company traded on U.S. exchanges to reach a nominal $1 trillion market cap. Broadcom's AI networking solutions are the preferred choice by businesses to maximize the computing potential of their GPUs and (most importantly!) to reduce tail latency. Minimizing lag is a must when split-second decisions are being made by AI software and systems."", 'Broadcom CEO Hock Tan believes its custom AI chips and other networking solutions should lead to between $60 billion and $90 billion in aggregate orders from its top three hyperscaler customers over the next three years.', 'AI application companies are benefiting, too.

It wasn’t just Nvidia, either: Tesla, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft tanked.', 'DeepSeek’s two AI models, released in quick succession, put it on par with the best available from American labs, according to Alexandr Wang, Scale AI CEO. And DeepSeek seems to be working within constraints that mean it trained much more cheaply than its American peers. One of its recent models is said to cost just $5.6 million in the final training run, which is about the salary an American AI expert can command. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the cost of training models ranged from $100 million to $1 billion. OpenAI’s GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, according to CEO Sam Altman. DeepSeek seems to have just upended our idea of how much AI costs, with potentially enormous implications across the industry.', 'This has all happened over just a few weeks. On Christmas Day, DeepSeek released a reasoning model (v3) that caused a lot of buzz. Its second model, R1, released last week, has been called “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen” by Marc Andreessen, VC and adviser to President Donald Trump. The advances from DeepSeek’s models show that “the AI race will be very competitive,” says Trump’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks. Both models are partially open source, minus the training data.', 'DeepSeek’s successes call into question whether billions of dollars in compute are actually required to win the AI race. The conventional wisdom has been that big tech will dominate AI simply because it has the spare cash to chase advances. Now, it looks like big tech has simply been lighting money on fire. Figuring out how much the models actually cost is a little tricky because, as Scale AI’s Wang points out, DeepSeek may not be able to speak honestly about what kind and how many GPUs it has — as the result of sanctions.', 'Even if critics are correct and DeepSeek isn’t being truthful about what GPUs it has on hand (napkin math suggests the optimization techniques used means they are being truthful), it won’t take long for the open-source community to find out, according to Hugging Face’s head of research, Leandro von Werra. His team started working over the weekend to replicate and open-source the R1 recipe, and once researchers can create their own version of the model, “we’re going to find out pretty quickly if numbers add up.”', 'Led by CEO Liang Wenfeng, the two-year-old DeepSeek is China’s premier AI startup. It spun out from a hedge fund founded by engineers from Zhejiang University and is focused on “potentially game-changing architectural and algorithmic innovations” to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) — or at least, that’s what Liang says. Unlike OpenAI, it also claims to be profitable.', 'In 2021, Liang started buying thousands of Nvidia GPUs (just before the US put sanctions on chips) and launched DeepSeek in 2023 with the goal to “explore the essence of AGI,” or AI that’s as intelligent as humans. Liang follows a lot of the same lofty talking points as OpenAI CEO Altman and other industry leaders. “Our destination is AGI,” Liang said in an interview, “which means we need to study new model structures to realize stronger model capability with limited resources.”', 'So, that’s exactly what DeepSeek did. With a few innovative technical approaches that allowed its model to run more efficiently, the team claims its final training run for R1 cost $5.6 million. That’s a 95 percent cost reduction from OpenAI’s o1. Instead of starting from scratch, DeepSeek built its AI by using existing open-source models as a starting point — specifically, researchers used Meta’s Llama model as a foundation. While the company’s training data mix isn’t disclosed, DeepSeek did mention it used synthetic data, or artificially generated information (which might become more important as AI labs seem to hit a data wall).', 'Without the training data, it isn’t exactly clear how much of a “copy” this is of o1', 'Without the training data, it isn’t exactly clear how much of a “copy” this is of o1 — did DeepSeek use o1 to train R1? Around the time that the first paper was released in December, Altman posted that “it is (relatively) easy to copy something that you know works” and “it is extremely hard to do something new, risky, and difficult when you don’t know if it will work.” So the claim is that DeepSeek isn’t going to create new frontier models; it’s simply going to replicate old models. OpenAI investor Joshua Kushner also seemed to say that DeepSeek “was trained off of leading US frontier models.”', 'R1 used two key optimization tricks, former OpenAI policy researcher Miles Brundage told The Verge: more efficient pre-training and reinforcement learning on chain-of-thought reasoning. DeepSeek found smarter ways to use cheaper GPUs to train its AI, and part of what helped was using a new-ish technique for requiring the AI to “think” step by step through problems using trial and error (reinforcement learning) instead of copying humans. This combination allowed the model to achieve o1-level performance while using way less computing power and money.', '“DeepSeek v3 and also DeepSeek v2 before that are basically the same sort of models as GPT-4, but just with more clever engineering tricks to get more bang for their buck in terms of GPUs,” Brundage said.', 'To be clear, other labs employ these techniques (DeepSeek used “mixture of experts,” which only activates parts of the model for certain queries. GPT-4 did that, too). The DeepSeek version innovated on this concept by creating more finely tuned expert categories and developing a more efficient way for them to communicate, which made the training process itself more efficient. The DeepSeek team also developed something called DeepSeekMLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention), which dramatically reduced the memory required to run AI models by compressing how the model stores and retrieves information.', 'What is shocking the world isn’t just the architecture that led to these models but the fact that it was able to so rapidly replicate OpenAI’s achievements within months, rather than the year-plus gap typically seen between major AI advances, Brundage added.', 'OpenAI positioned itself as uniquely capable of building advanced AI, and this public image just won the support of investors to build the world’s biggest AI data center infrastructure. But DeepSeek’s quick replication shows that technical advantages don’t last long — even when companies try to keep their methods secret.', '“These close sourced companies, to some degree, they obviously live off people thinking they’re doing the greatest things and that’s how they can maintain their valuation. And maybe they overhyped a little bit to raise more money or build more projects,” von Werra says. “Whether they overclaimed what they have internally, nobody knows, obviously it’s to their advantage.”', 'The investment community has been delusionally bullish on AI for some time now — pretty much since OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. The question has been less whether we are in an AI bubble and more, “Are bubbles actually good?” (“Bubbles get an unfairly negative connotation,” wrote DeepWater Asset Management, in 2023.)', 'It’s not clear that investors understand how AI works, but they nonetheless expect it to provide, at minimum, broad cost savings. Two-thirds of investors surveyed by PwC expect productivity gains from generative AI, and a similar number expect an increase in profits as well, according to a December 2024 report.', 'The public company that has benefited most from the hype cycle has been Nvidia, which makes the sophisticated chips AI companies use. The idea has been that, in the AI gold rush, buying Nvidia stock was investing in the company that was making the shovels. No matter who came out dominant in the AI race, they’d need a stockpile of Nvidia’s chips to run the models. On December 27th, the shares closed at $137.01 — almost 10 times what Nvidia stock was worth at the beginning of January 2023.', 'DeepSeek’s success upends the investment theory that drove Nvidia to sky-high prices. If the company is indeed using chips more efficiently — rather than simply buying more chips — other companies will start doing the same. That may mean less of a market for Nvidia’s most advanced chips, as companies try to cut their spending.', '“Nvidia’s growth expectations were definitely a little ‘optimistic’ so I see this as a necessary reaction,” says Naveen Rao, Databricks VP of AI. “The current revenue that Nvidia makes is not likely under threat; but the massive growth experienced over the last couple of years is.”', 'Nvidia wasn’t the only company that was boosted by this investment thesis. The Magnificent Seven — Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet — outperformed the rest of the market in 2023, inflating in value by 75 percent. They continued this staggering bull run in 2024, with every company except Microsoft outperforming the S&P 500 index. Of these, only Apple and Meta were untouched by the DeepSeek-related rout.', 'The craze hasn’t been limited to the public markets. Startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also hit dizzying valuations — $157 billion and $60 billion, respectively — as VCs have dumped money into the sector. Profitability hasn’t been as much of a concern. OpenAI expected to lose $5 billion in 2024, even though it estimated revenue of $3.7 billion.', 'DeepSeek’s success suggests that just splashing out a ton of money isn’t as protective as many companies and investors thought. It hints small startups can be much more competitive with the behemoths — even disrupting the known leaders through technical innovation. So while it’s been bad news for the big boys, it might be good news for small AI startups, particularly since its models are open source.', 'Just as the bull run was at least partly psychological, the sell-off may be, too. Hugging Face’s von Werra argues that a cheaper training model won’t actually reduce GPU demand. “If you can build a super strong model at a smaller scale, why wouldn’t you again scale it up?” he asks. “The natural thing that you do is you figure out how to do something cheaper, why not scale it up and build a more expensive version that’s even better.”', 'But DeepSeek isn’t just rattling the investment landscape — it’s also a clear shot across the US’s bow by China. The advances made by the DeepSeek models suggest that China can catch up easily to the US’s state-of-the-art tech, even with export controls in place.', 'The export controls on state-of-the-art chips, which began in earnest in October 2023, are relatively new, and their full effect has not yet been felt, according to RAND expert Lennart Heim and Sihao Huang, a PhD candidate at Oxford who specializes in industrial policy.', 'The US and China are taking opposite approaches. While China’s DeepSeek shows you can innovate through optimization despite limited compute, the US is betting big on raw power — as seen in Altman’s $500 billion Stargate project with Trump.', '“Reasoning models like DeepSeek’s R1 require a lot of GPUs to use, as shown by DeepSeek quickly running into trouble in serving more users with their app,” Brundage said. “Given this and the fact that scaling up reinforcement learning will make DeepSeek’s models even stronger than they already are, it’s more important than ever for the US to have effective export controls on GPUs.”', 'For others, it feels like the export controls backfired: instead of slowing China down, they forced innovation', 'DeepSeek’s chatbot has surged past ChatGPT in app store rankings, but it comes with serious caveats. Startups in China are required to submit a data set of 5,000 to 10,000 questions that the model will decline to answer, roughly half of which relate to political ideology and criticism of the Communist Party, The Wall Street Journal reported. The app blocks discussion of sensitive topics like Taiwan’s democracy and Tiananmen Square, while user data flows to servers in China — raising both censorship and privacy concerns.', 'There are some people who are skeptical that DeepSeek’s achievements were done in the way described. “We question the notion that its feats were done without the use of advanced GPUs to fine tune it and/or build the underlying LLMs the final model is based on,” says Citi analyst Atif Malik in a research note. “It seems categorically false that ‘China duplicated OpenAI for $5M’ and we don’t think it really bears further discussion,” says Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in her own note.', 'For others, it feels like the export controls backfired: instead of slowing China down, they forced innovation. While the US restricted access to advanced chips, Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen found creative workarounds — optimizing training techniques and leveraging open-source technology while developing their own chips.', 'Doubtless someone will want to know what this means for AGI, which is understood by the savviest AI experts as a pie-in-the-sky pitch meant to woo capital. (In December, OpenAI’s Altman notably lowered the bar for what counted as AGI from something that could “elevate humanity” to something that will “matter much less” than people think.) Because AI superintelligence is still pretty much just imaginative, it’s hard to know whether it’s even possible — much less something DeepSeek has made a reasonable step toward. In this sense, the whale logo checks out; this is an industry full of Ahabs. The end game on AI is still anyone’s guess.', 'AI has been a story of excess: data centers consuming energy on the scale of small countries, billion-dollar training runs, and a narrative that only tech giants could play this game. For many, it feels like DeepSeek just blew that idea apart.', 'While it might seem that models like DeepSeek, by reducing training costs, can solve environmentally ruinous AI — it isn’t that simple, unfortunately. Both Brundage and von Werra agree that more efficient resources mean companies are likely to use even more compute to get better models. Von Werra also says this means smaller startups and researchers will be able to more easily access the best models, so the need for compute will only rise.', 'DeepSeek’s use of synthetic data isn’t revolutionary, either, though it does show that it’s possible for AI labs to create something useful without robbing the entire internet. But that damage has already been done; there is only one internet, and it has already trained models that will be foundational to the next generation. Synthetic data isn’t a complete solution to finding more training data, but it’s a promising approach.', 'The most important thing DeepSeek did was simply: be cheaper. You don’t have to be technically inclined to understand that powerful AI tools might soon be much more affordable. AI leaders have promised that progress is going to happen quickly. One possible change may be that someone can now make frontier models in their garage.', 'The race for AGI is largely imaginary. Money, however, is real enough. DeepSeek has commandingly demonstrated that money alone isn’t what puts a company at the top of the field. The longer-term implications for that may reshape the AI industry as we know it.', 'FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE', 'The Galaxy S25 Ultra, announced today, comes with Qualcomm’s latest chipset, an upgraded 50MP ultrawide camera, and not much else, hardware-wise, except rounded edges which make it a lot easier to hold.

However, many in the tech sector believe DeepSeek is significantly understating the number of chips it used (and the type) due to the export ban.

Four big reasons to worry about DeepSeek (and four reasons to calm down),https://www.platformer.news/deepseek-ai-explainer-china-worries/,"['The Chinese AI upstart has rattled Silicon Valley — but how much the game has changed remains to be seen', 'Programming note: Platformer will be off tomorrow as I welcome a new assistant to help you all with your various customer service and billing questions and get her up to speed. Also: This is a column about AI. My boyfriend works at Anthropic. See my full ethics disclosure here.', 'I. DeepSeek rising', 'Today, let’s talk about DeepSeek.', 'On Monday, the Nasdaq fell 3.1 percent as investors considered what the Chinese company’s high-performing, cheap-to-train, App Store-topping new models meant for the future of artificial intelligence and the tech industry overall. The leading maker of specialized AI chips, Nvidia, suffered most of all — its stock price dropped 17 percent, erasing $600 billion in market value.', 'As news of DeepSeek’s achievement spread over the weekend, it became a kind of Rorschach test. While everyone is impressed that DeepSeek built the best open-weights model available for a fraction of the money that its rivals did, opinions about its long-term significance are all over the map. ', 'To many prominent voices in AI, DeepSeek seems to have confirmed what they already believed. To AI skeptics, who believe that AI costs are so high that they will never be recouped, DeepSeek’s success is evidence of Silicon Valley waste and hubris. To AI bulls, who think America needs to build artificial general intelligence before anyone else as a matter of national security, DeepSeek is a dire warning to move faster. And to AI safety researchers, who have long feared that framing AI as a race would increase the risk of out-of-control AI systems doing catastrophic harm, DeepSeek is the nightmare that they have been waiting for.', 'Whatever the truth is won’t be known for some time. Reading the coverage over the past few days, and talking with folks who work in the industry, I’m convinced that DeepSeek is a huge story deserving of our ongoing attention. At the same time, I’m not sure that the emergence of a powerful, low-cost Chinese AI model changes the dynamics of competition quite as much as some observers are saying. ', 'With that in mind, here are some reasons worth worrying about DeepSeek — and some reasons to calm down.  ', 'II. Reasons to worry', 'No one really knows what DeepSeek’s long-term game is. As you may know by now, DeepSeek was created by a 10-year-old Chinese quantitative hedge fund named High-Flyer; Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s CEO, is also a cofounder of the fund. High-Flyer developed AI algorithms for use in trading; in 2023, it started a lab to build AI tools unrelated to its core business. ', 'Over the next year or so, it made a series of technical innovations in building large language models. Its stated mission, as posted on its X profile, is to “Unravel the mystery of AGI with curiosity.” The company has committed to open-sourcing its models, and has offered them to developers at very cheap prices.', 'For the moment, DeepSeek doesn’t seem to have a business model to match its ambitions. For most big US AI labs, the (yet unrealized) business model is to develop the best service and to sell it at a profit. To date, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a kind of altruistic giveaway.', 'That could change at any time. DeepSeek could introduce subscriptions, or place new restrictions on its developer APIs. Zvi Mowshowitz theorizes that the company could take user data and give it to the hedge fund for trading insights.', 'And at some point, the Chinese government will have something to say about one of its companies trying to give away powerful AI to anyone who wants it, including China’s adversaries. ', 'In the meantime, though, we can only guess what DeepSeek’s ambitions are. And that worries me, because in some very real sense we don’t know what we’re dealing with here. ', 'The big AI labs don’t seem to have much of a moat. Somewhat lost in the DeepSeek conversation so far is that the company’s impressive v3 and r1 models were built on top of American innovations. It was the US AI labs who developed the underlying architecture for large language models and the newer reasoning models; what DeepSeek has done is to cleverly optimize that architecture using old hardware and less computing power. ', 'In the old days, by which I mean the time of GPT-3, it took OpenAI’s rivals months or longer to reverse-engineer its process and absorb its innovations. It might take a year for those techniques to filter down to the open-source models that are made available for free. ', 'But DeepSeek shows that the open-source labs have gotten much better at reverse-engineering — and that any lead the US AI labs come up with can be quickly erased. This is a problem if your main business is selling models to developers: switching costs are low, and the cost savings they can achieve by using DeepSeek are huge.', 'For the AI labs, this is a business problem. But it could be a geopolitics problem, too: DeepSeek’s innovation shows that there will be no keeping AI out of anyone’s hands, for better and for worse. As Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark put it today: “DeepSeek means AI proliferation is guaranteed.”', 'DeepSeek’s success will lead more people to see AI as an arms race against China.', 'For some venture capitalists in particular, it has long been a goal to frame AI progress as a contest against China. This idea was central in “Situational Awareness,” Leopold Aschenbrenner’s viral essay from last year about AI progress, whose publication coincided with the former AI researcher announcing that he had started a new venture capital firm.', 'VCs love this framing for lots of reasons. It builds on a rational fear: that an authoritarian government will create superhuman intelligence before democracies do and use it against them. But it is also meant to serve as ammunition against regulations, which would slow both AI progress and returns to VCs’ portfolios; and to drum up interest in military tech, which generates further returns to those same portfolios. ', 'In general I think we should be against the world’s richest people cheerleading us into armed conflict.', 'The more that people believe AI is an existential race against China, the less safely it will be built.   ', 'Say what you will about the failures of US AI labs — and there are many — but they have at least tried to outline methods for building powerful AI safely. DeepSeek, by contrast, has not said one word about AI safety. If it has a lone AI safety researcher, that’s news to me. ', 'To accelerationists, this could be a reason for US companies to abandon their safety efforts — or at least, reduce future investments in them.', 'It’s important to remember that all of the most important AI safety problems remain unsolved. Should one of the corporate AI labs suddenly invent and release a superhuman intelligence, there is no way to ensure it is aligned with human values or desires, and no plan for what to do next. The Biden administration placed some gentle restrictions on US AI labs with an executive order, but Trump repealed it on day one. ', 'As Mowshowitz writes: “These people really think that the best thing humanity can do is create things smarter than ourselves with as many capabilities as possible, make them freely available to whoever wants one, and see what happens, and assume that this will obviously end well and anyone who opposes this plan is a dastardly villain.”  ', 'III. Reasons for calm', 'Everyone basically already assumed that all of this was going to happen. By “all of this,” I mean that (1) open-source companies would reverse-engineer everything the big labs are doing and (2) that costs for AI training and inference would decline dramatically over time. ', 'Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, noted over the weekend that “costs for GPT-4 level intelligence dropped by 1000x in the last 18 months.” For that reason, he writes, “A 95% price drop in reasoning models seems not to be something that will break the labs.”', 'Funnily enough, Google released its own super-cheap reasoning model just five days ago, built on similar techniques, and no one cared at all. (It’s not open source or free or Chinese. But still!)', 'Anyone who has sent the same query to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini on the same day has known for more than a year that you can get basically as good an answer from any of them. And anyone who has used Llama has known for more than a year that the open-weights version that arrives later is only slightly worse.', 'Right now a lot of investors are catching up to these basic facts at the same time, and stock prices are falling accordingly. But it’s not clear to me that much of it was really news to the AI labs and tech platforms.  ', 'Tech companies can still find good use for all those AI capital expenditures.', 'American tech companies plan to spend tens of billions of dollars building data centers to serve their AI needs this year. One question many folks were asking today was whether DeepSeek would make all of those investments moot. If you can build a best-in-class model with older hardware, what’s the point?', 'The point is to (1) train more powerful models and explore techniques that open-source developers haven’t ripped off yet; and (2) to serve the demand that those more powerful and capable models generate. While much of the AI discussion over the past six months has revolved around the bottleneck that a lack of chips has created for training new models, the real bottleneck is that no one has as much computing power as they want. ', 'For the most part, the same servers and chips that fund model training can be used for inference. DeepSeek’s innovation means that the day you can run a state-of-the-art model on your laptop is much closer. But we’re not there yet.', 'The export controls are helping.', 'Some observers have said that DeepSeek’s progress shows that the Biden administration’s restrictions on chip exports have failed. I don’t think that’s right. As Jordan Schneider writes at ChinaTalk, these export controls are relatively new — and need more time to really have an effect.', 'A primary effect of the export controls is that China should have less computing power than the United States overall for some time. That means that even as Chinese companies like DeepSeek release more powerful models, China may not be able to deploy them as widely as it would like to.', 'That same computing power is also essential for inventing more powerful AI systems. As Miles Brundage, a former policy researcher at OpenAI, put it recently on a podcast with Schneider: “There are all sorts of ways of turning compute into better performance, and American companies are currently in a better position to do that because of their greater volume and quantity of chips.”', 'American AI labs are still in the lead. ', 'DeepSeek’s innovations are real, and they go a long way toward making the AI systems we have today cheaper and more accessible. But to the extent that they represent conceptual breakthroughs, it’s only in optimizing technology that OpenAI and others invented first. There can be a ton of value in optimization, of course, and I’m sure every American company wishes they had come up with these first. (Meta’s teams are now reportedly in overdrive trying to reverse-engineer them.) ', 'At the same time, it was only last week that OpenAI made available to Pro plan users a computer that can use itself. The whole US AI industry has shifted its focus to building AI agents and full-fledged virtual coworkers. To date, very little of that is visible. (And as I wrote last week, OpenAI’s Operator can be unbelievably frustrating to use.) Perhaps DeepSeek or another Chinese company could beat the United States to the punch with agents. But it seems likelier that they will simply wait for an American company to release a good one and try to copy it. ', 'I can understand why some people look at the progress DeepSeek has made and assume that it is about to overtake every US lab. If the company is as careless about safety as it appears to be, there may someday be an actual reason to panic. For the moment, though, I think everyone would benefit from taking a few long deep breaths.

I don't know."", ""Dylan Lewis: I need you all weeks, but I think this week, in particular, me, and I think our listeners need you to walk through what was a massive market shakeup related to AI. We saw a Big Tech response to that market shakeup and we're going to unpack all of that. The news of the week, DeepSeek. The Monday, really, the market was processing the fact that there was a new AI chatbot out of China on par with what we are currently seeing in the market from Open AI and other players like Anthropic but operating at a fraction of the cost. Asit that market processing turned into hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap being wiped away from companies like NVIDIA, other Big Tech players, energy stocks. Can you walk through a little bit of what the market was looking at as they were seeing this news?"", ""Asit Sharma: Sure. DeepSeek is a company based in China, a scrappy, ambitious, large language model creator. They have a model called R1 and R1 has performance equivalent to the 01 model of GPT. This is not news of itself, but the company published a paper which showed how they did it and that backed up some claims that the DeepSeek R1 model is trained at a much lower cost versus Western models, and it also provides inference at a much cheaper cost. When it answers a question, that compute is cheaper as well. Looking at how they did it, there are some novel approaches like being able to solve a problem without the resources. We know the US has put these export controls on high-end chips, and so it's a novel, innovative way to both train a model and give output much cheaper. For those who are interested, they do things like activate fewer parameters in the model at a given time rather than using all the parameters, they use concepts of something called sparsity."", ""Being very efficient with information in different ways, the upshot is that I think most of the artificial intelligence world looked at what they've done, looked at the papers, and said, maybe not all of this is quite the savings that they're purporting, but it's legit. With that, we had a chain of reaction, a nuclear chain of reactions as people looked around the landscape and said, Hey, wait a minute. Do we really need to spend all these billions on high-end NVIDIA GPUs if there's a way to do this stuff faster, smarter, cheaper. Here we have it. This was the market reaction. Of course, a lot has transpired in just a few days since Monday when the markets woke up to this realization, and we can dive into that."", ""Dylan Lewis: We saw that hit. The chip companies. We saw that hit the companies that have done all the cloud buildout. We've seen that hit energy companies as people have wondered if the energy demands are going to be quite what they were estimated to be. Jason, I look at the way that this has come together and it feels like a very rapid resizing of what the TAM could be for some of those businesses, because technology has moved on a little bit. But I think we have to remind ourselves, a lot of those estimates on what these addressable markets might be and what these opportunities might be have been a bit of a finger in the wind because of how nascent some of this technology is."", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think it's all still very new. There's a lot that we don't know. I think Asit made some great points there in regard to I love the word used the scrappy. That's exactly what this is, and we should see more of that. I think ultimately, like Asit mentioned, technology, it's all about better, faster, cheaper. At some point or another. That's the trend that we ultimately pursue is we want things to make our lives more efficient. We want it at a lower cost and that all works. Now, I think investing is always so funny. But this was so headline-driven. It was driven by so much uncertainty. The funny thing to me was there just is so much that we don't know. There was this headline number of $6 million, I think, they were saying DeepSeek built this model out with, but nobody really knows."", ""We don't understand exactly what's behind all of this. But there was an interesting study, I didn't want to bring this up because I think it matters, particularly as we talk about AI and these new fangled AI search engines that we use. There was a study done by Newsguard which focuses on all this stuff and they went through and looked at these different LLMs, these different AI engines to see what engines are more reliable, which ones work better, and DeepSeeks chatbot achieved only 17% accuracy in delivering news and information according to this Newsguard audit. That ranked it number 10/11 companies that they ranked. That is comparing it to others like ChatGPT, and Google's [Alphabet's] Gemini among others. It's said they chatbot repeated false claims 30% of the time and gave vague or useless or not useful answers, 53% of the time. When we talk about utilizing this technology in whatever aspect, a lot of this boils back down to reliability and trust. Can I trust that it's giving me what I need? Of course, we're going to get there. You get to think about Google's just basic search that wasn't perfect at first either. But I think it's just something to remember that when we talk about all of these new AI engines that are doing things that apparently are supposed to make our lives easier, better and faster, whatnot. It is going to be some time to really perfect this technology."", ""To me, when I think about what's going on with DeepSeek, this just seems like a very headline driven emotional reaction to the market that we probably need to learn more about before we make any a definitive decision."", 'Dylan Lewis: Well, we did not have to wait long to hear from some of the major industry players with their take on DeepSeek and the direction of the AI industry. We had earnings out from a lot of big tech companies, which I love. We get the immediate reaction, including Dutch chip equipment manufacturer, ASML, and how quickly the outlook can change, Asit. Company was down Monday, roaring right back after reporting results later in the week.', ""Asit Sharma: Yes, ASML famously sells these very high-end machines that enable chip manufacturers to make the chips that power our electronics and computers, and they have a newish model. These are high-end EUV machines, Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation machines that enable the lithography on chips. They've got some older models which are EUV machines, and they also have models which help companies build lower process chips, so stuff that goes in our electronics. When you put all these sales together, they can be lumpy, and that's not my word. That's the word that management of ASML uses, the Dutch management team to describe how their bookings, so what they record in new sales each quarter can jump around. We have seen ASML be so volatile over the last few quarters, simply because investors were like, are you going to be selling more of the high-end machines next quarter or are you selling more of the mid level range? We don't understand how your business is going. This quarter, great revenue on the top line, 24% growth and an outlook that doubled what analysts were expecting four bookings, the outlook is very nice."", ""But management is saying, look, because it's so hard to predict this stuff, we're actually going to stop issuing this bookings guidance in the near future. But this has an implication, as you said, Dylan, because there was another message there, which is, look, artificial intelligence is still a driver for us, so we're going to keep building the high-end stuff. There's still a market for, so no one has to panic today."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to hear more on that theme after the break. We're going to have some more chip talk after the break, including what Microsoft and Meadows management teams have to say about the DeepSeek drama and the direction of AI. Stay right here. You'll listening to morning. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Here on air with Fool analyst Jason Moser and Asit Sharma. DeepSeek made AI waves this week, but Big Tech got to say their piece, too. Earnings out from Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. Asit, let's start out with Microsoft. They are the highest on the food chain of AI when it comes to the Cloud business and their partnership with Open AI. What did you see in the results?"", ""Asit Sharma: Results look solid to me, Dylan. Microsoft revenue increased to almost 70 billion bucks versus this time last year, so that was a 12% increase. Diluted earnings per share only grew 10%. I'm always expecting a little bit more out of Microsoft on that EPS number, but still decent. I think the big story here was that the market looked at the growth in Microsoft's Cloud business, the infrastructure business that serves up AI. This is Azure. That only grew 31%. The market wanted 32%, so we saw Microsoft sell off a bit. But the big picture here, the big picture story this is a company that's still investing a lot of CapEx capital expendiure going into AI. It has a strong future in this business, and results were, as I said before, just solid what you'd expect out of Microsoft."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think if you're looking for some guidance from management over there, Sacha Adela saying, What's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with regular compute cycles. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. Talking about the efficiency elements we were getting to earlier with technology. As that curve bends Asit, Microsoft not slowing down that CapEx bend, hit over 22 billion for the past quarter, nearly double where it was a year ago."", ""Asit Sharma: Absolutely, and one thing that was very interesting in all that commentary was Microsoft is being very flexible in its hardware and its software. There was a clear message yesterday after what we saw out of DeepSeek that, look, we're going to be an open platform so as we build out all these data centers, if the best model is DeepSeeks, we'll let people use that. If AMD is the better solution over Intel NVIDIA or vice versa, we'll go there. We'll make sure that everyone can use the best tools because at the end of the day, we want to be seen as that low cost high quality provider."", 'Dylan Lewis: Also saw results from Meta this week, and unlike some of its big tech peers, Jason, not nearly as affected by the DeepSeek news after earnings, shares hitting new all time highs.', ""Jason Moser: Yes, well, I think the strong continue to get stronger, and Meta is one of the stronger businesses out there. No, it's worth mentioning. They are spending a lot in order to do all of this. The AI investments, the reality, labs investments, but the market seems perfectly happy with it for now. We'll see how those investments bear fruit over time. But the results are for the quarter were very encouraging. Revenue for the quarter was $48.4 billion. I was up 21% and that ultimately resulted in $8.02 in earnings per share. That was up 50% from a year ago. As I mentioned, they continued to spend heavily as they build out their AI capabilities. And we've talked about this through the last week or so with this target of somewhere in the neighborhood of $60-$65 billion in capital expenditures here just over the course of the next year to build out that AI capability. The nice thing about that for Meta, though, is it serves them two ways. It gives them the opportunity to participate in the AI opportunity, chatbot, stuff like that, but it also helps make their business ultimately better, as well."", ""I think as long as investors are on board, then there's no reason why we should continue to doubt it. This is a platform with 3.3 billion people that used at least one of their family of apps on a daily basis in December. This thing is connecting the world, it just seems like steady as she goes. Meta is doing a lot of neat things. I think the big question mark for me, honestly, is reality labs. Reality labs continues to just incinerate money. Revenue there in reality labs for the quarter was $1.1 billion. It was basically flat but the business lost about $5 billion versus around $4.6 billion just a year ago. That's a big question mark. I think will those investments ever really pay off? It feels like the AI investments probably make a little bit more sense at this point. The reality labs, immersive technology stuff still wait-and-see mode."", ""Dylan Lewis: That came up on Metas call, and Zuckerberg said that this was really going to be one of the big years for understanding the opportunity when it came to the AI classes as a category, pointing to the fact that a lot of the really big breakout products in consumer tech have started to sell millions of units as they've gotten into that third generation. I feel like that has been so far from a lot of investors' minds because it is not where the cash is coming from. It's where the cash is being funneled into in terms of funding the efforts. But is that something that at all plays into your outlook for the business at this point."", ""Jason Moser: At this point, no at some point, we have to recognize whether this is just throwing good money after bad. We're just not there yet. I think immersive technology, it's been a space that's developed a little bit more slowly than some may have hoped. But the beauty of this business is that they are the leader in the social media space. I thought it was really encouraging to see that they are going to be making some efforts to try to monetize threads. Now, I'm not a threads user, but there are apparently 320 million actives that do use it, and Zuckerberg has the goal of getting that to one billion plus users as well over time. If they can pull off monetizing that, well, that's just going to provide a little bit more cash for them to continue investing in the future and seeing what works and what doesn't."", ""Dylan Lewis: For anyone with doubts about the Cloud buildout and all of that CapEx spend, Mark Zuckerberg telling investors, it's possible we'll learn otherwise at some point, but it is simply too early to say that we're over investing in this zone and that he feels like that infrastructure buildout is a strategic advantage, no matter where this industry goes. Asit putting together what we've got from Meta and from Microsoft this week, are you happy to see them continuing to invest in all of that Cloud infrastructure?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think I am. I think it's a game of trying to understand what the capacity needs are going to be, how much you can derive from that. What's going to be your economic profit in a few years? The realization that if you build it and they don't come, that is going to be some depreciation expense on your income statement without the revenue. It's a delicate game, and I know they expend a lot of compute resources themselves and trying to model this stuff out. Bottom line, I agree. If I were in their shoes right now, I'd be building, too. I'd be getting a little more cautious as each quarter goes by, but I'd be in build mode."", 'Dylan Lewis: Spoken like a true accountant Asit.', ""Jason Moser: Unfortunately, it'll bring the counter."", ""Dylan Lewis: Last but certainly not least when it comes to Market Cap, largest company in the world, Apple, also reporting this week. I think the trend of Apple's ho hum results have continued. We have a lot of big questions about this business. A lot of them still not really being answered."", ""Asit Sharma: Ho hum is a great word, great term for this, Dylan, because Apple had a record quarter, 123 billion odd in sales, but it only grew 4%. Earnings per share also a record, but they were up only 10% year over year. Now, just peeling into that, services business still going very strong for Apple, but the big driver of this company is, of course, the iPhone. IPhone revenue was 69 billion. Now, remember just a few minutes ago, I talked about Microsoft's total revenue for the quarter approaching 60,970 billion. Here we are with one product that just shows, again, the massive imprint of this company on this consumer landscape. But, there's some puts and takes here. The iPhone in China has had a little bit of disappointing trajectory over the last few quarters. Sales were down 11% year over year. CEO Tim Cook talked about the fact that, look, they had some channel inventory movement during the quarter. That's part of the reason those sales were down."", ""But also, Apple Intelligence is not yet in those Chinese iPhones, so that's another reason why the demand isn't as strong as we might like. Looking though ahead, maybe they start to pick up momentum as incorporating AI on device becomes a bigger thing for Apple. Right now, it hasn't had quite the uptake that I expected it might. To Apple's defense, though, they are still a very innovative company and I will note, one of the entities that came out this week with a really great analysis of that DeepSeek R1 model were the engineers and research scientists at Apple."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit, Jason, don't go anywhere, and listeners. Stay right there, too. We'll be back in just a minute with more earnings from the past week, including rundowns from Tesla and Starbucks. You're listening. It's Motley Fool money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined on air by Jason Moser and Asit Sharma. Fools, it is a rare week that Tesla earnings get pushed to the second half of the show. Jason, that is just the kind [laughs] of late January we're having."", ""Jason Moser: It's a busy, busy month, for sure. Listen, Tesla's stock it's up better than 100% over the last year, so it's been a story investors continue to support. But I wouldn't call this earnings report anything terribly special. In the near term, I think it prompts some questions regarding the auto side of the business, which is obviously the crux of the business, specifically on what profitability looks like going further down the road and even really the margin side as well. Total automotive revenue was down 8% from a year ago, deliveries grew 2%. We saw operating cash flow of $4.8 billion. That grew modestly from $4.4 billion a year ago. Again, going back to that margin side, I think that's a big challenge. That's a question we're going to have to continue to ask in regard to this business."", ""We've seen the automotive gross margins come down fairly significantly over the past several years as price wars have escalated somewhat. But ultimately, it all brought it down to the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 for the full year. I think, to me, it was encouraging to see energy generation and storage. That continues to impress. They saw revenue of just over $3 billion. It was up 113% from a year ago, with its highest gross profit ever. There are a million different ways we can go in discussing Tesla, and I'm looking forward to doing that with Dylan, [laughs] but that seems like the most important stuff right off the bat."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah, Asit we also got the benefit of looking at the four year results. They closed out their fiscal year when they were reporting this quarter. Revenue up 1%. That is not really a number that a lot of people are used to seeing from Tesla. Jason talks a little bit about the automotive segment. We see some strength when it comes to their energy business and their services business. What's jumping out to you as you look at the results?"", ""Asit Sharma: Well, I like that those two businesses combined are now roughly 1/3 of the operating profit of the company. They're growing and contributing. That 1% is so interesting because it reflects the market dynamics. Tesla having to discount vehicles and move vehicles at quarter end to try to keep up with fierce Chinese competition and maybe more cautious buyer in the US and other parts of the globe for electric vehicles. The hybrid market is looking so attractive right now for so many consumers and investors as well. But I think one of the things that Tesla is going to really hone in on is they've lowered their cost of each vehicle. They had a chart in this quarter's earnings, which they always do, showing the progression of their cost of goods sold for each vehicle. It's the lowest it's ever been, but they have to keep building capacity and they need demand to be there. It only helps so much if you can't keep selling at scale. There's this very interesting dynamic where that brand is going to need to keep pushing in the marketplace for them to get back to the profitability levels they had in the past."", ""Dylan Lewis: In typical Elon Musk fashion, we not only got what happened in the last quarter and over the last year, but we also got to look forward at what is going on with Tesla's business and some of the big hairy goals that they're going after. One of those is a more affordable model. He noted that they are on track to start production in the first half of 2025. Asit, Jason was talking about some of the margin compression and the effects when it comes to their automotive segment. I have to imagine them going after more affordable models is also going to put a little bit further pressure on them."", ""Asit Sharma: It will, but this is going to be a case of making your money on volume rather than margin, and they have no choice because the Chinese in particular have shown themselves to be so adept at having pretty fun cars at a low price point. Tesla has to go there, and they have been on the shelf and off the shelf with the idea of a cheaper car for years. I'm glad to hear that they're coming to market with that."", 'Dylan Lewis: Musk also made mention of some other future land projects. Their unsupervised full self driving, which will be coming to Austin, Texas in June, according to the CEO, and its purpose built robotaxi scheduled for volume production in 2026. These are out there in terms of ideas, very futurery, Jason. How do they factor into the Tesla story for you?', ""Jason Moser: Well, very futurery indeed. Listen, I don't put anything past this guy. I think Elon Musk is an amazing entrepreneur, and he obviously sets the bar very high. He doesn't have a great track record of hitting those timelines. But I think ultimately that's what investors are so enthusiastic about regarding this story is what it becomes beyond just a car company. The robotaxi, [laughs] the humanoid optimist robot. All of those things put together, it's clearly participating in the AI opportunity as well. I thought it was interesting in the call. Listen, talk about setting the bar high. Now in the call, Musk said there is a path, and he clarified this is a very difficult path, but he sees a path where Tesla will or can be worth more than the next top five companies combined. Now, just think about that for a second. We're talking about companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, etc. That is a lot. Ultimately, that is all due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots as he put it in the call. That is where he's looking. I think it's really up to investors to determine whether they actually believe that is something that will play out in the course of their lifetimes. For some of us, maybe it will, for some of us, maybe it won't. But that's ultimately is what guides his thinking today."", 'Dylan Lewis: Starbucks officially in its Brian Niccol era, the coffee chain bringing its first quarterly report public with the new CEO at the helm. Jason, market certainly liked to report, shares up about 10% this week. But I think more than anything else for me, this report reminded me that for all the fanfare around leadership, turning a business around takes quite a bit of time.', ""Jason Moser: It really does. I'll be honest with you as a shareholder of Starbucks myself, I was a little surprised at the market's reaction to this because it was a very underwhelming report, but to your point, this is new leadership, and they are basically trying to turn around one of the bigger companies out there in the retail landscape. I think investors are giving Brian Niccol some rope here as he works to get things back on track. I think he was a huge upgrade from previous leadership, don't get me wrong, but it is going to take some time. He just started in September 2024, you look at the numbers, like I said, not terribly overwhelming. We saw revenue of just $9.4 billion essentially flat. We saw active Starbucks rewards memberships at $34.6 million today. That was $34.3 million a year ago, so they're not really growing that out either. Global comp store sales declined 4%. That was driven by a 6% decline in transactions, but that was partially offset by a 3% increase in average ticket, and that ticket is what caught my attention because something you noted in the call that they've changed the philosophy of this company, they started reducing the frequency of discount driven offers, and they saw this quarter 40% fewer discounted transactions from a year ago."", ""They are going back to that pricing argument. They're trying to give a premium experience, premium product, and they want to demand a little bit more premium pricing. We'll see how that plays out. The traffic numbers are a little concerning there, but this is Starbucks, it's coffee, [laughs] and it's tea. I do feel like there is a lot of opportunity there. One final point I will make that I thought was just fascinating here in the call, he sees the opportunity in the US alone to double the store account from today. When you think about it, they have over 17,000 stores in the US today. He sees the opportunity to double that. I feel like there's an onion article there, Dylan."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] Yeah, I was going to say, if you thought there was a Starbucks location [laughs] close to you, just wait, they will get even closer. You mentioned the moving away from discounting. I think the company is moving some of that marketing's budget and promotional budget over to more branding and storytelling. That is part of Niccol's approach with back to Starbucks. He wants to revisit the original story of the company. He's also having them focus on the role that their coffee house is play in the community, really making sure that they get that morning timeshare right and looking to empower their baristas again to delight their customers. From those major priorities in his plan, are there ones that you'd particularly like to see them make progress on soon?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I definitely love to see them continuing to invest in the workforce, really going back to the roots of what makes that company so good. You go in there and it's an experience. I think a lot of people felt like it became a little bit more of an assembly line experience recently, particularly with the strength in mobile and what they've been able to do with that. To me, I think another really encouraging part of what they're trying to do is they're talking about simplifying the menu. They're just trying to get back to doing what they do really well. They talk about seeing basically 30% reduction in both food and beverage SKUs by the end of this fiscal 2025. I think for a lot of consumers, that's been one of the problems with Starbucks. It is a little bit confusing."", 'Asit Sharma: Yeah, Jason, I really like what you called out because to me, Brian Niccol is doing something very similar to what he did at Chipotle, which is looking at the business fresh and saying, ""Okay, what is the basic blocking and tackling we need to do here to get this business back on track?"" It\'s not rocket science here. I love looking at the brand, increasing that, moving to higher value transactions, all the stuff that you pointed out. This should be really positive for shareholders, except maybe for that vision where maybe I\'m leasing out part of my backyard for [laughs] Starbucks location. Other than that, I like what he\'s doing so far.', ""Jason Moser: Yeah, not rocket science, but definitely rocket fuel. That's their competitive advantage."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit, you thought working from home wouldn't give you the chance to go to a coffee shop every day, [laughs] just wait."", 'Asit Sharma: I was wrong.', ""Dylan Lewis: Take a couple steps into your backyard, and you'll have your morning brew waiting for you. [laughs] Bringing us home over on the Earnings Parade, it is the payments giants, Mastercard and Visa. We're going to digging into the numbers for both of these businesses, but I think Asit, kick us off here, every indicator so far from the holiday season. You look at results we get from e-commerce trackers, results we've gotten from retailers, and now the results we've gotten from Mastercard and Visa saying this holiday season was a very strong one for consumers and for retailers."", ""Asit Sharma: Yeah, what's up with the global consumer? What's up with the US consumer? They just keep chugging along, despite inflation, despite people feeling very scared about the future in many instances. Mastercard is one that I looked at. Just numbers are quite strong. Net revenue increasing 14%, they had platform growth, the gross dollar volume up 12%. That all important cross border volume which often drives these companies up 20% for Mastercard. I think these giants really benefit as people keep spending, but they're also both of them doing things to protect those motes. Mastercard, example, is buying a company which specializes in cybersecurity. Why? Because they can show that their network is safer because they have better fraud prevention tools and that prevents the younger upstarts from taking market share because everyone who is a merchant is worried about the potential impact of fraud on their business. I think both companies really doing what they do best in facilitating transactions, and they keep acquiring bits and pieces to make their networks stronger, more secure, more attractive to merchants."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, you dug into the results from Visa. Are we seeing a similar story with what they're reporting?"", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think we are. This is just another boring, stodgy payments company that just continues to flex its massive network effect muscles. It's just amazing. You think about these companies, they're pushing through $15 plus trillion of volume on an annual basis, and it was a great start to the year here, $9.5 billion in net revenue was up 10% from a year ago. Earnings per show up 14%. They saw overall payments volume up 9% from a year ago. Ran $4 trillion through the network just this quarter alone. We saw strength in US with payments volume up 7%. International was up 11%. Asit mentioned cross border with Mastercard. That's another point of strength for Visa here, that was up 16%. There's no reason to believe that any of this should really change in the near future. This is just how money is moved more and more digitally and more and more through these networks. We know that Mastercard and Visa really control most of those toll booths."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the curious non-earnings pieces of news this week that I wanted to dig into with Visa, they will reportedly be the partner to bring financial services to Elon Musk's X app. This is a planned peer to peer payments app using debit cards and money transfers from bank accounts, plan to launch later this year. I guess we shouldn't be too surprised by this one, Jason, because Musk has talked about wanting to make X into more than just a social media app."", ""Jason Moser: Absolutely. There's just zero risk, I think, for Visa here in trying this. This is something where they can try it, if it works great, if it doesn't, OK. Certainly, X is in a position where they are trying to figure out how to monetize that platform and grow it. I don't know that speaking as an individual. I can't imagine I would ever want to be moving money through X personally. But I think that one thing that Musk has done since he bought it, he's created a little bit more of a creator economy within it. We're seeing people being able to monetize their usage of Twitter or X a little bit more so than ever before. I think for those folks, it actually could be a nice little value add. It might be an easy way to deal with the platform and how they maybe make money through creating on the platform. But I guess we'll have to wait and see there."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, coming up next, Jason and Asit have their stocks on their radar this week. Quick break ahead of that, stay right here.

Our man behind the glass, Rick Engdahl is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, taking a look at UPS. Ticker is UPS. [laughs] Obviously, a very big move for such a big company this week, big sell off of the stock based on the earnings report there. It wasn't a bad quarter, but investing, as we know, is about the future, and they definitely made some news on that front. They're talking about some particular challenges that they're dealing with, but I think that the headline really was in regard to the cutting of the volume with their largest customer, that customer being, of course, Amazon. They are talking about cutting that volume and ultimately whittling that down by about 50% over the course of the next couple of years. Back half of 2026, they expect to cut that volume by 50% or more. I understand that. Amazon is their largest customer, but it's not their most profitable customer. I think that's an important thing to note there."", ""The margin on that business is actually dilutive to UPS's business. They're going to try to get away from that and focus on becoming a little bit more profitable, cutting some of that business. It definitely makes sense, but it is something that will impact that top line growth, at least for the foreseeable future here for the next year plus. I definitely understand the reaction that investors had there. It's one heck of a headline, losing that business, but I think zooming out, it makes a lot of sense. Large customer risk is always something to worry about and this move is meant to address that risk and ultimately tamp it down."", 'Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about UPS.', ""Rick Engdahl: Just looking at the stock chart, it seems to have gone to the moon and back in the last five years. Now it's sitting where it was in 2019. Was that just an anomaly? This is supposed to be a slow and steady company, and it's back where it should be now?"", ""Jason Moser: It's definitely a slow and steady company. I think it went through a little bit of a funny stretch there over the last few years with everything that went on with COVID and whatnot, but this is one that the longer you own it, the more sense it makes, and that dividend will remain reliable."", 'Dylan Lewis: Asit, what is on your radar this week?', ""Asit Sharma: ServiceNow, symbol NOW. This is a company that supplies apps to enterprise businesses and actually helps them develop apps in house. It helps with automation, spinning up AI within big businesses. This is a company that is very expensive. It's trading at 62 times forward earnings, but it's taking a hit this week because you know when you're high priced and you miss analyst sms just a bit, this is what happens. Subscription revenue, a very important part of this business was off by about a percent versus analyst projections. Stock is sold off, but a very strong company with deep relationships in the Fortune 500. If this falls further, I'm really looking to pick up some more shares. I'm a share owner of this business."", 'Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about ServiceNow.', ""Rick Engdahl: ServiceNow's stock chart. I was looking at that one, too, and it's a lot nicer. It goes up into the right, pretty steadily. Is this the case where the winners just keep winning?"", 'Asit Sharma: It is a winners keep winning company. Thanks for tripping [laughs] me up there.

HOW DID DEEPSEEK TRAIN ITS AI MODEL ON A LOT LESS – AND CRIPPLED – HARDWARE?,https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/01/27/how-did-deepseek-train-its-ai-model-on-a-lot-less-and-crippled-hardware/,"['Maybe they should have called it DeepFake, or DeepState, or better still Deep Selloff. Or maybe the other obvious deep thing that the indigenous AI vendors in the United States are standing up to their knees in right now.', 'Call it what you will, but the DeepSeek foundation model has in one short week turned the AI world on its head, proving once again that Chinese researchers can make inferior hardware run a superior algorithm and get results that are commensurate with the best that researchers in the US, either at the national labs running exascale HPC simulations or at hyperscalers running AI training and inference workloads, can deliver.', 'And for a whole lot less money if the numbers behind the DeepSeek models are not hyperbole or even mere exaggeration. Unfortunately, there may be a bit of that, which will be cold comfort for the investors in Nvidia and other publicly traded companies that are playing in the AI space right now. These companies have lost hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization today as we write.', 'Having seen the paper come out a few days ago about the DeepSeek-V3 training model, we were already set to give it a looksee this morning to start the week, and Wall Street’s panic beat us to the punch. Here is what we know.', 'DeepSeek-AI was founded by Liang Wenfeng in May 2023 and is effectively a spinout of High-Flyer AI, a hedge fund reportedly with $8 billion in assets under management that was created explicitly to employ AI algorithms to trade in various kinds of financial instruments. It has been largely under the radar until August 2024, when DeepSeek published a paper describing a new kind of load balancer it had created to link the elements of its mixture of experts (MoE) foundation model to each other. Over the holidays, the company published the architectural details of its DeepSeek-V3 foundation model, which spans 671 billion parameters (with only 37 billion parameters activated for any given token generated) and was trained on 14.8 trillion tokens.', 'And finally, and perhaps most importantly, on January 20, DeepSeek rolled out its DeepSeek-R1 model, which adds two more reinforcement learning stages and two supervised fine tuning stages to enhance the model’s reasoning capabilities. DeepSeek AI is charging 6.5X more for the R1 model than for the base V3 model, as you can see here.', 'There is much chatter out there on the Intertubes as to why this might be the case. We will get to that. Hold on.', 'Interestingly, the source code for both the V3 and R1 models and their V2 predecessor are all available on GitHub, which is more than you can say for the proprietary models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, and others.', 'But what we want to know – and what is roiling the tech titans today – is precisely how DeepSeek was able to take a few thousand crippled “Hopper” H800 GPU accelerators from Nvidia, which have some of their performance capped, and create an MoE foundation model that can stand toe-to-toe with the best that OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic can do with their largest models as they are trained on tens of thousands of uncrimped GPU accelerators. If it takes one-tenth to one-twentieth the hardware to train a model, that would seem to imply that the value of the AI market can, in theory, contract by a factor of 10X to 20X. It is no coincidence that Nvidia stock is down 17.2 percent as we write this sentence.', 'In the DeepSeek-V3 paper, DeepSeek says that it spent 2.66 million GPU-hours on H800 accelerators to do the pretraining, 119,000 GPU-hours on context extension, and a mere 5,000  GPU-hours for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on the base V3 model, for a total of 2.79 million GPU-hours. At the cost of $2 per GPU hour – we have no idea if that is actually the prevailing price in China – then it cost a mere $5.58 million to train V3.', 'The cluster that DeepSeek says that it used to train the V3 model had a mere 256 server nodes with eight of the H800 GPU accelerators each, for a total of 2,048 GPUs. We presume that they are the H800 SXM5 version of the H800 cards, which have their FP64 floating point performance capped at 1 teraflops and are otherwise the same as the 80 GB version of the H100 card that most of the companies in the world can buy. (The PCI-Express version of the H800 card has some of its CUDA cores deactivated and has its memory bandwidth cut by 39 percent to 2 TB/sec from the 3.35 TB/sec on the base H100 card announced way back in 2022.) The eight GPUs inside the node are interlinked with NVSwitch es to created a shared memory domain across those GPU memories, and the nodes have multiple InfiniBand cards (probably one per GPU) to create high bandwidth links out to other nodes in the cluster. We strongly suspect DeepSeek only had access to 100 Gb/sec InfiniBand adapters and switches, but it could be running at 200 Gb/sec; the company does not say.', 'We think this is a fairly modest cluster by any modern AI standard, especially given the size of the clusters that OpenAI/Microsoft, Anthropic, and Google have built to train their equivalent GPT-4 and o1, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 models. We are very skeptical that the V3 model was trained from scratch on such a small cluster. It is simply hard to accept until someone else repeats the task. Luckily, science is repeatable: There are companies with trillions of curated tokens and tens of thousands of GPUs to see if what DeepSeek is claiming is true. On 2,048 H100 GPUs, it would take under two months to train DeepSeek-V3 if what the Chinese AI upstart says is true. That’s pocket change for the hyperscalers and cloud builders to prove out.', 'Despite that skepticism, if you comb through the 53 page paper, there are all kinds of clever optimizations and approaches that DeepSeek has taken to make the V3 model, and these, we do believe that they do cut down on inefficiencies and boost the training and inference performance on the iron DeepSeek has to play with.', 'The key innovation in the approach taken to train the V3 foundation model, we think, is the use of 20 of the 132 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on the Hopper GPU to work, for lack of better words, as a communication accelerator and scheduler for data as it passes around a cluster as the training run chews through the tokens and generates the weights for the model from the parameter depths set. As far as we can surmise, this “the overlap between computation and communication to hide the communication latency during computation,” as the V3 paper puts it, uses SMs to create what is in effect an L3 cache controller and a data aggregator between the GPUs not in the same nodes.', 'As the paper puts it, this communication accelerator, which is called DualPipe, has the following tasks:', 'In another sense, then, DeepSeek has created its own on-GPU virtual DPU for doing all kinds of SHARP-like processing associated with all-to-all communication in the GPU cluster.', 'Here is an important paragraph about DualPipe:', '“As for the training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism, which has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through computation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead. In addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize InfiniBand and NVLink bandwidths. Furthermore, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint, making it possible to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly tensor parallelism. Combining these efforts, we achieve high training efficiency.”', 'The paper does not say how much of a boost this DualPipe feature offers, but if a GPU is waiting for data 75 percent of the time because of the inefficiency of communication, reducing that compute delay by hiding latency and scheduling tricks like L3 caches do for CPU and GPU cores, then maybe, if DeepSeek can push that computational efficiency to near 100 percent on those 2,048 GPUs, the cluster would start acting it had 8,192 GPUs (with some of the SMs missing, of course) that were not running as efficiently because they did not have DualPipe. OpenAI’s GPT-4 foundation model was trained on 8,000 of Nvidia’s “Ampere” A100 GPUs, which is like 4,000 H100s (sort of). We are not saying this is the ratio DeepSeek attained, we are just saying this is how you might think about it.', 'And here is another interesting architectural feature of the DeepSeek model: V3 uses pipeline parallelism and data parallelism, but because the memory in managed so tightly, and overlaps forward and backward propagations as the model is being built, V3 does not have to use tensor parallelism at all. Weird, right?', 'Another key innovation for V3 is that auxiliary loss-free load balancing mentioned above. When you train a MoE model, there has to be some sort of router to know which model to send which tokens, just like you have to know which model to listen to when you query a bunch of the models inherent in the MoE.', 'Another performance boost is FP8 low precision processing, which boosts bandwidth through the GPUs at the same time as making the most of the limited 80 GB of memory on the H800 GPU accelerators. The majority of the V3 model kernels are implemented in FP8 format. But certain operations still require 16-bit of 32-bit precision, and master weights, weight gradients, and optimizer states are stored in higher precisions than FP8. DeepSeek has come up with its own way of microscaling the mantissas and exponents of data being processed such that the level or precision and numerical range necessary for any given calculation can be maintained without sacrificing the fidelity of the data in a way that hurts the reliability of the answers that come out of the model.', 'One neat technique that DeepSeek came up with its to promote higher-precision matrix math operations on intermediate results in the tensor cores to the vector units on the CUDA cores to preserve a semblance of higher precision. (Enough of a semblance to get output that looked like 32-bit math was used for the whole dataset.) Incidentally, DeepSeek uses 4-bit exponents and 3-bit mantissas – is called E4M3 – on all tensor calculations inside the tensor cores. None of this funny bitness is happening inside there. It is just happening in the CUDA cores. FP16 formats are used inside the optimizer and FP32 formats are used for the master weights of the V3 model.', 'There are lots of other neat tricks, such as recomputing all RMSNorm operations and recomputing all MLA up-projections during back propagation, which means they do not take up valuable space in the HBM memory on the H800 card. The exponential moving average (EMA) parameters, which are used to estimate the performance of the model and its learning rate decay, are stored in CPU host memory. Memory consumption and communication overhead is cut further by caching activations model activations and optimizer states in lower precision formats.', 'After perusing the paper, judge for yourself if all of the clever tweaks can add up to a 10X reduction in hardware. We are skeptical until we see proof.', 'Interestingly, in the V3 model paper, DeepSeek researchers offered Nvidia – or other AI accelerator providers – a list of needed features.', '“Our experiments reveal that it only uses the highest 14 bits of each mantissa product after sign-fill right shifting, and truncates bits exceeding this range. However, for example, to achieve precise FP32 results from the accumulation of 32 FP8×FP8 multiplications, at least 34-bit precision is required. Thus, we recommend that future chip designs increase accumulation precision in Tensor Cores to support full-precision accumulation, or select an appropriate accumulation bit-width according to the accuracy requirements of training and inference algorithms. This approach ensures that errors remain within acceptable bounds while maintaining computational efficiency.”', 'DeepSeek has developed a method of tile-wise and block-wide quantization, which lets it move the numerical range of numbers at a certain bitness around within a dataset. Nvidia only supports tensor quantization, and DeepSeek wants Nvidia architects to read its paper and see the benefits of its approach. (And even if Nvidia does add such a feature, it might be turned off by the US government.)', 'DeepSeek also wants support for online quantization, which is also part of the V3 model. To do online quantization, DeepSeek says it has to read 128 BF16 activation values, which is the output of a prior calculation, from HBM memory to quantize them, write them back as FP8 values to the HBM memory, and then read them again to perform MMA operations in the tensor cores. DeepSeek says that future chips should have FP8 cast and tensor memory acceleration in a single, fused operation so the quantization can happen during the transfer of activations from global to shared memory, cutting down on reads and writes. DeepSeek also wants GPU makers to fuse matrix transposition with GEMM operations, which will also cut down on memory operations and make the quantization workflow more streamlined.', 'Now, here is the kicker, which we alluded to above. DeepSeek trains this V3 model. To create the R1 model, it takes the output of other AI models (according to rumor) and feeds them into reinforcement learning and supervised fine training operations to improve the “reasoning patterns” of V3. And then, here is the kicker, as outlined in the paper:', '“We conduct post-training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences and further unlock its potential. During the post-training stage, we distill the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-R1 series of models, and meanwhile carefully maintain the balance between model accuracy and generation length.”', 'Later in the paper, DeepSeek says this: “We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline elegantly incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3 and notably improves its reasoning performance. Meanwhile, we also maintain control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3.”', 'How much does this snake eating tail described above boost the effectiveness of the V3 model and reduce the training burden? We would love to see that quantified and qualified.', 'Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW', '', '', '', '“And here is another side effect: The V3 model uses pipeline parallelism and data parallelism, but because the memory in managed so tightly, and overlaps forward and backward propagations as the model is being built, V3 does not have to use tensor parallelism at all. Weird, right?”', 'This is mostly because of the small # of GPUs used, they can use expert parallelism as well, to eliminate the need for TP, if you used more GPUs, you’d need TP', 'If this is indeed “DeepFake”, then its one of the best engineered shorts (both in an energy and IT capital sense) in decades.', 'So it’s all mechanics, and really not a touch of actual theory.\nBut then, what is the theory behind LLMs? Doh!', 'Man, that opening paragraph should be typeset in gold and hung on your office wall. Great work, Timothy.', 'DeepSeek’s innovations in GPU memory management and communication optimization are fascinating, particularly their DualPipe algorithm and their novel approach to FP8 precision. The repurposing of 20 SMs as communication accelerators is especially clever – essentially creating a virtual DPU on the GPU itself to handle all-to-all communication.', 'I share the writers skepticism about achieving equivalent performance to GPT-4 with only 2,048 H800s. Even with their elimination of tensor parallelism and efficient pipeline/data parallelism, a 10x reduction in hardware requirements seems ambitious. I’m particularly interested in seeing independent verification of their E4M3 precision claims and how they maintain numerical stability when promoting calculations from tensor cores to CUDA cores. Their request for increased accumulation precision in future tensor cores is telling – it suggests they’re pushing right up against the limits of what’s possible with current hardware.', 'Would this DualPipe approach work even better on unified memory like MI300A?', 'I need to think about that. My gut reaction is yes, since it is really about staging data across GPUs in all-to-all communication. Being an APU doesn’t really change that.', 'Their neatest trick is getting people to really believe they don’t have a room full of H100s.', 'What impresses me about DeepSeek-V3 is that it only has 671B parameters and it only activates 37B parameters for each token. Instead of trying to have an equal load across all the experts in a Mixture-of-Experts model, as DeepSeek-V3 does, experts could be specialized to a particular domain of knowledge so that the parameters being activated for one query would not change rapidly. This would allow a chip like Sapphire Rapids Xeon Max to hold the 37B parameters being activated in HBM and the rest of the 671B parameters would be in DIMMs. This would be an ideal inference server for a small/medium size business. Queries would stay behind the company’s firewall. Unlike data center GPUs, this hardware could be used for general-purpose computing when it is not needed for AI. The HBM bandwidth of Sapphire Rapids Xeon Max is only 1.23 TBytes/sec so that needs to be fixed but the overall architecture with both HBM and DIMMs is very cost-effective. The reason it is cost-effective is that there are 18x more total parameters than activated parameters in DeepSeek-V3 so only a small fraction of the parameters need to be in costly HBM. Imagine a Xeon Diamond Rapids with 4.8 TBytes/sec of HBM3E bandwidth. That could generate about 4800B / 37B = 130 tokens/sec using DeepSeek-V3.', 'NVIDIA’s market cap fell by $589B on Monday. This loss in market cap is about 7x more than Intel’s current market cap ($87.5B). At NVIDIA’s new lower market cap ($2.9T), NVIDIA still has a 33x higher market cap than Intel.', 'Timothy Prickett Morgan wrote a good article about Xeon Max here:', 'nextplatform.com/2022/11/15/sapphire-rapids-xeon-sps-plus-hbm-offer-big-performance-boost', 'Interesting scenario, Sunil. Thanks for that.', 'Another banger Tim. Nice deepdive on deepseek… ha', 'Many in and out of Nvidia are claiming that this is actually a validation of the technology; that refinement of the methods of doing AI will make it plausible for more than 3-4 big companies to offer technology based on AI. I don’t know to what degree it’s true, but I really feel it’s necessary. I’m honestly not that impressed by what the AI industry has offered to date, and doubt it will be all that useful to a lot of industries. I think we need a lot more improvement before AI can be widely useful, and I’d rather have dozens of places trying to improve the state of the art, rather than just a handful.', 'As I said before, more sanctions on China will only lead to more innovation from Chinese engineers. And Trump is going to Make China Great Again.', 'Rather like having a family with your sister, training one model on the output of another is how the insanity starts.', 'Commentators testing bias have shown that deep seek can generate information relating to subjects censored by China. (They tell the LLM to use substitute characters, by-passing internal censors.) This indicates that the LLM was trained outside the Chinese firewall. This opens the possibility of training outside China on higher spec hardware.', 'I asked it a simple question about a legal issue in my country, and it succeeded in generating a human-like answer but failed to answer the question correctly.

DeepSeek’s Ascent Means B2B Firms Need to Consider AI ROI,https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/deepseeks-ascent-means-b2b-firms-need-to-consider-ai-roi/,"['The pace of progress across the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape in the past year has been enormous.', 'Large, general-purpose models like OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude have dominated the headlines and enterprise use cases alike. These powerhouses, designed to handle a vast array of tasks across multiple domains, have set a high bar for what AI can do.', 'That all changed last week when the Chinese competitor DeepSeek shocked the world with its capabilities — and its comparatively low cost. For example, OpenAI charges API customers $60 to output a million o1 tokens, while DeepSeek only charges $2.19, making it nearly 27 times cheaper.', 'Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun said in a post on LinkedIn that the impact of DeepSeek showed that “open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.”', 'For many industries, the priority isn’t necessarily having the “best” AI in terms of sheer power, but rather one that is reliable, cost-effective and tailored to specific operational needs.', 'At the same time, businesses using open-source models like DeepSeek must ensure proprietary or confidential data isn’t exposed in fine-tuning or usage; and depending on the industry (finance, healthcare, etc.), AI deployment must adhere to data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA or HIPAA.', 'Still, smaller, more specialized models could gain traction in B2B applications, even if they don’t directly challenge OpenAI, Google or Anthropic. For most business users, having the absolute best model is less important than having one that’s reliable and good enough. Not every driver needs a Ferrari.', 'Read more: AI Agent Systems Are Here — Will They Transform B2B?', 'Industries such as financial services, logistics and healthcare are increasingly recognizing the value of AI solutions that are domain-specific rather than the one-size-fits-all approaches offered by larger models. These industries deal with complex, highly specialized data and operational needs that require a level of customization and precision that general-purpose AI may struggle to provide. As AI continues to be integrated into these sectors, businesses are looking for solutions that can be directly applied to their unique challenges, without the need for massive computational power or extensive training datasets.', 'For instance, in the financial services sector, firms are leveraging AI for a range of use cases, from fraud detection to customer service automation. However, these applications often require AI models that are specifically trained on financial data, customer behavior patterns and regulatory frameworks. A general-purpose model may not be able to deliver the same level of accuracy or reliability when it comes to niche financial tasks, even though it could handle more generic queries.', 'Similarly, in healthcare, AI is being used to assist with diagnosis, drug discovery and patient care. These applications demand models that are specialized in medical terminology, disease patterns and clinical workflows. An AI solution built for a broad range of industries may lack the deep understanding of medical specifics required for optimal results. In these cases, companies like DeepSeek — whose models are trained on specialized healthcare datasets — are gaining traction as they offer more accurate and contextually relevant insights.', 'Read more: AI’s Growing Role Across B2B Payments Will Be Impossible to Ignore in 2025', 'For many B2B companies, the shift toward specialized AI solutions offers several advantages. One of the primary benefits is cost-effectiveness. General-purpose models like GPT-4 require massive computational resources to run effectively, which can make them expensive to deploy, particularly for small to mid-sized businesses. Specialized models, on the other hand, can often be more efficient in terms of both computational power and cost, as they are trained on smaller, domain-specific datasets and are optimized for specific tasks.', 'Moreover, specialized models tend to be more reliable for industry-specific applications. The reliability of an AI model is crucial in B2B contexts where decisions based on AI predictions can have significant financial or operational consequences. A model that is trained to understand the nuances of a particular industry is more likely to provide accurate and actionable insights, which can drive better business outcomes. In sectors like logistics, where predictive models are used to optimize supply chains and reduce inefficiencies, reliability and precision are key.', 'Customization is another critical factor. Many industries are looking for AI solutions that can be tailored to their specific needs. A model that is built with the ability to adapt to a company’s internal processes, data structures and goals offers far more value than one that operates as a “black box” with limited flexibility. For example, in the logistics sector, companies may want AI systems that can integrate seamlessly with their existing tracking and inventory management systems. In healthcare, AI solutions need to be customized to work with electronic health records (EHR) systems, medical imaging tools and other healthcare technologies. Specialized AI providers are better positioned to offer these kinds of tailored solutions.', 'Western Union’s new media network business contributed to 56% revenue growth for its Consumer Services segment in the fourth quarter.', 'The provider of cross-border, cross-currency money movement, payments and financial services announced the launch of its media network business in November, saying that this new offering lets companies advertise to Western Union customers via company-owned channels, reach a global audience, and connect with consumers when they are in a “commerce mindset.”', 'Together with the launch of this offering in the United States, the company’s expansion of its retail foreign exchange business in Europe contributed to the growth of its Consumer Services segment in the fourth quarter, it said in a Tuesday earnings release.', '“We have made it a goal to grow this segment of our business double digits annually by providing new products and services to our existing customers through our existing channels,” Western Union President and CEO Devin McGranahan said Tuesday (Feb. 4) during the company’s quarterly earnings call.', 'Overall, Western Union’s fourth-quarter revenue increased 1%.
